Before you read my story, here's a little bit about me. I'm a male in my 20's who is going through a barbaric GI episode and trying to find answers to my problems.

In the first week of September, I noticed a change in my bowel movements. I'd have this random feeling to go to the bathroom out of the blue without even eating anything. The frequent bowel movements usually started after my morning breakfast and no matter how many times I pass my stools, I'd feel incomplete like I'd still have to be back after a while. I also noticed small amounts of mucus every now and then but it didn't concern me much.

While this continued, one day I noticed a small amount of blood (could say less than 2 drops) in my stool. I did not have any other issues like constipation or pain. Went to a GI doctor for the same and was told not to worry about it as he said that it could have been due to anal fissures or hemorrhoids. Gave me some meds and did not see blood or mucus until I was consuming them. Once the meds were over, the frequent bowel movements and mucus-y stools started.

Again went to the doc and he ordered blood and stool tests. The blood tests came back with slightly elevated levels of Eosinophils, Amylase, Aspartate aminotransferase(40.95) & Alanine aminotransferase (59.30) whereas the stool test indicated the presence of bacteria. Was put on a different round of meds again. This time my symptoms worsened and started experiencing foul smelling semi-solid stools pretty much every single time I had to poop. God I wish I could describe how awful the smell was. I still noticed mucus just like before. I really wanted to resist the feeling of having to poop because of the horrendous smell but I couldn't help it. I gotta say that at this point I forgot how normal poop would look/smell like because it was semi-solid with an awful smell every time.

The meds did not work for me this time as my problems still continued to persist. I told the doc that this isn't working out and he suggested to take stool culture test as my initial stool test showed the presence of bacteria and endoscopy. The stool culture test came back normal with the comment ""Normal flora growth and no enteric pathogens like Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., and Vibrio sp. were isolated"". The endoscopy came back with ""Mild Antral Gastritis. LAX LES / Hiatus Hernia"". The doc said that he was clueless as to why this is happening to me. He suggested to continue the meds but at this point I was so frustrated because the meds weren't working for me. 

I stopped the meds for a week and I again noticed blood covered in the mucus of my stool again. I panicked and I decided to get a second opinion from another GI doctor.

Went to this new GI doc in October. Explained everything to the new doc and I was asked to recall the list of all foods that I ate in the last couple of days. He asked me whether the frequent bowel movements/mucus in stool started after eating certain foods that contain gluten or diary because the foods I ate the previous day did contain a lot of gluten. As for diary, I'd drink coffee only when I feel like I want to. He suggested that I might be gluten/lactose intolerant and asked me to experiment with these two. He asked me to stop consuming gluten/diary to see if my bowel movements improved. As a matter of fact, it did improve for like a week. If I have to put a number, I'd say probably like a 40%. The smell of my poop didn't change much but the frequency of my bowel movements somewhat improved. 

He asked me to carry on this gluten/lactose free diet for 2 weeks but he said that I'd still have to get a colonoscopy in order to rule out the possibilities of polyps and hemorrhoids. Suggested to get my blood tested for deficiencies as the previous one didn't test for it. The tests came back with a moderate Vitamin D deficiency and I was given supplements for the same. At this point, the vitamin supplements were the only meds I was taking besides following a GF/LF diet.

After going through the horrible phase of prepping for colonoscopy, I finally got it done. Guess what. The tests came back squeaky clean with no polyps or hemorrhoids. But for 3 days after my colonoscopy,  I truly felt better as I passed normal smelling stools without mucus. The frequency of bowel movements drastically reduced from what it used to be and I was over the moon that things have finally settled. But I was wrong. Though I didn’t poop much often, I again noticed blood covered in mucus.

My doc was as confused and clueless as me. Suggested to take IgE and food allergy test. The IgE test came back with elevated levels (454 IU/mL) and the food allergy test came back normal citing that I had no allergies towards any food. My doctor is not aware of this test result yet as my appointment isn’t until next week.

I’m still following a GF/LF diet as of today since October so if I’m allergic/intolerant then I should feel much better when I don’t consume them. I really don’t know what’s going on with me and I’d appreciate if someone could offer some guidance. Thanks for giving this a read.

Here is the list of meds that I was put on:

Pantoprazole and Domperidone (for acid reflux), Mebeverine (antispasmodic), Rifaximin (antibiotic), Probiotic with Lactobacillus acidophilus",1,1733890161.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

After serving in the military, I’ve built a life that’s solid and fulfilling. I value loyalty, hard work, and keeping things fun, and now I’m ready for what’s next—marriage, kids, and all the joys (and surprises) that come with creating a family.

I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I do enjoy a strong cup of coffee, the occasional drink, and staying active. Whether I’m scuba diving, cooking up a new recipe, working on a DIY project (yes, I renovated my entire house solo), or boating, I’m always keeping busy with things I love. Family is a big part of my life, and I believe in living healthy and staying active—finding someone who feels the same would be amazing.

I’m hoping to meet someone kind, down-to-earth, and emotionally steady, ideally in her 20s or early 30s, who’s ready to build a loving family and share an incredible future. If that sounds like you, I’d love to hear your story and see where this could take us!

Invest at your own risk. 

This is part 2 of the Most Important Post You Will Ever Read.  

If you haven’t read part 1, which is about the Soundhound Ai and Nvidia Blackwell Theory, I highly encourage you to read it. It will change your perspective and maybe one day change your life, depending on what plays out. Time will tell. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Soundhound/comments/1h9yigz/the\_most\_important\_post\_you\_will\_ever\_read/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soundhound/comments/1h9yigz/the_most_important_post_you_will_ever_read/)

I wanted to make sure I got one more message out in this domain because I know there are people reading this as we speak, sitting with a substantial or massive gain that they probably never expected. Or maybe you did expect it, because I know I did, and now like me you are sitting here holding and witnessing how hard it is with the day in day out price action that takes place. Specially with the blood sucking short sellers swarming this stock.  

I’m here with the second part to my original post to provide legit factual information on why to maintain and hold the line. 

Below are the partnerships that have been confirmed and announced from the company (includes brands that have been directly named and those who haven’t been named except for high level ambiguous announcements that don't provide a brand).

The one thing in common between all of them? 

They all have had zero formal press releases other than the mention in either a basic post on some platform like LinkedIn or in an earnings transcript from last/this year. 

As stock traders, you should know this but mentioning in case you don’t. What brings new buyers into a stock and causes the rise in stock price? Partnership announcements/deals, MAJOR PRs, and of course delivering on earnings (Soundhound working to be EBITA positive in 2025, this is also huge). 

I created the list from what I feel are the biggest announcements (I’m sure everyone has their own opinions on how each one ranks). You will see each has a reference on where to find it, along with some photos. I also included the speculative pending partnerships because I feel those are important to include as well. Feel free to comment and add ones I have missed, I’m sure there are some because this company continues to ink deal after deal after deal. 

If you didn't know, the CFO in his presentation at the USB conference last week, stated they are now getting call after call with people wanting to utilize their products and services.  

What had me originally release my Nvidia Blackwell Theory post was the amount of uneducated speculation that I saw around with people wondering what caused the recent stock pump. I kept seeing people wondering if Torchy’s Tacos caused a massive pump, which I just thought to myself, these stock holders need to hear some truth.  

There are bigger things at play here. Knowledge is power. Things you / I / we cannot see or know because they are behind the curtain.  

The reason I’m posting again is to remind everyone here one simple thing... 

Don’t sell your ticket to the show of a lifetime before we are let into the building, the tickets are punched, and the curtain is lifted.

**Partnerships confirmed, with brand confirmed, no press release -**

1.    Nvidia partnership - bringing voice ai to the edge without no cloud connectivity. More info will be revealed Jan 7th-10th at CES. No doubt the biggest deal of them all. Remember Nvidia Drive is on the Blackwell GPU, which leads me to believe Nvidia Blackwell x Soundhound Ai.

I'm recovering fine at home. It's finally comfortable for me to fully use my arms (while not lifting or bearing weight of course), I'm starting to be able lift more weight while following sternal precautions (e.g. I put a stack of plates from the dishwasher into the cabinet), and my pain is under control with a combination of Tylenol and Gabapentin and a Tramadol once a day (I'm definitely paying attention to see if I need 2 though). I can also put on and take my shirt off fairly normally. 

My stamina is doing really great. I actually cooked homemade chicken nuggets tonight, because I was craving chicken nuggets but wanted them to be heart healthy. This post will mention cooking as an important skill/habit for recovery.

Also the amount I'm sleeping is starting to getting better. I think I slept a total of 12 hours today. I've definitely been having crazy dreams like people have mentioned. I'm still dealing with some back aches, the occasional emotional low, and I still need to rest after a long stretch of activity. Others have said the pain starts to go away on 3-4 weeks so looking forward to that.

My appetite is still a little low, but I honestly didn't have a 3 meal a day appetite before surgery (trying to eat smaller meals more frequently now). This is actually one of the pre-diagnosis bad habits I'm working on changing. Normally I'm one of those people who will have coffee and a muffin for breakfast, coffee and whatever sandwich making material I left in the refrigerator at work for lunch, and then 1 real meal a day for dinner. If I had to summarize my week 1 status: this is the first time since having open heart surgery where I don't feel like I had open heart surgery. Now it just feels like I have a bad back injury.

Lately I've been thinking about how I would have prepared for my surgery if I had more advance notice, and I'm writing this for anyone who has some extra time to prep. Everything from my diagnosis to where I am now as I write this post, happened over the course of 4 weeks. I was diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve, and my anyeurisms were so large, I was at a significant risk of aortic dissection.

So not only did I want to get surgery ASAP, but I had to limit all physical activity. Luckily, I was already in pretty good shape, but I had 1) taken a break from working out regularly for 2 months and 2) broke my pinky toe 2 weeks prior and was even more sedentary than normal, because I was working from my home and staying off my feet while it healed. If you read my other posts, the broken toe is how this all started.

I want to share some aspects of my pre-diagnosis lifestyle that have really helped recovery and some weird (maybe others do these things too) habits I have that have turned out to be useful.

I'll start with cooking and diet. I have always loved to cook. My mother started teaching me when I was really young by letting me help out around the kitchen. I cook a lot of different cuisines, I am a strong proponent of preparing your mise en place before you actually start, and the whole process is really meditative. I get a plan ready in my head and just zone out and do it.

This has been very helpful, because as the doctor will tell you everyone, not just valve replacement patients ;), should be eating a heart healthy diet. For me already having an established habit and knowledge of cooking regularly, not eating out too often (Maybe 3-4 out of 21 meals a week between going out, occasional lunch at work, ordering out), and almost never eating fast food (twice a month maybe) has made the food aspect much easier. If you don't know how to cook, I strongly recommend getting your kitchen ready, putting on a chef's hat (I seriously recommend trying it at least once), and starting to learn.

Speaking of food, I've followed a pretty healthy diet the majority of my life. My mother almost always cooked with extra virgin olive oil and maybe a little vegetable oil here and there, which I continue to do. I never use seasonings with added salt and really don't understand why they exist (except maybe stuff like Old Bay, za'atar, gochujang, etc). In fact I really don't like mixed seasonings in general, because I'm a control freak about flavor. I've come around in the past couple years, but still nothing with added salt. 2000mg is the daily recommended amount of salt per day according to my doctor, and this has actually been the main change to my diet. I always double check the nutrition labels when I'm at the grocery store, but I'm one those home cooks who ""measures with my heart"" when it comes to seasoning. Which again, if you aren't using seasonings with added salt or eating food already in sodium, that's not a problem. I've never been one to oversalt my food, but now when I use something with sodium like soy sauce, mustard, or the ingredients I mentioned above, I'll measure it. Paprika, tumeric, garlic powder (again NOT garlic salt which has no reason to exist), cumin, cardamom, etc. I still just blast away and put as much as I know it needs.

One final note, is that I really don't eat a lot of beef or pork, because I never buy it at the grocery store. I think I bought steaks like two months ago, because we were grilling with some friends, but we pretty much stick to seafood (mostly different kinds of fish but sometimes shellfish as a treat) and chicken at home. I eat beef and pork, but really only at a restaurant, friend's house, or if it's a ""special occasion"". I told the dietician at the hospital most of these details, and she pretty much said, good keep doing that.

I'll talk about fitness, but I implore you, PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST TO MAKE SURE WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS SAFE. Especially if you were in a state like I was.

I'm one of those people where every day is leg day. I usually do full body workouts, and no matter what additional leg workouts I do, I squat every time I go to gym. I also do at least two core workouts every time whether it's planks, situps, those military situps where you balance on your butt and kick your legs, etc.

Also flexibility and balance have probably prevented more than a few catasrophes this past week. Just like never skipping leg day, flexibility and balance have always been really important to me ever since I started weight lifting as a kid. Mainly because, you will never be able to get into the 300lb+ range (I'm officially quitting this kind of weightlifting btw) with the Olympic lifts without also developing your flexibility and balance.

I prefer yoga, because it's guided, I like the motions and flowing through one pose to the next, and it makes me feel really good after. I think fitting in any kind of isometric workout between regular workouts does the trick though. I think the main reason I have been like 95% independent is because even though I can't use my upper body, I can at least use my core and lower body to move around, adjust myself, squat down to lift things, etc. instead of reaching.

Finally I'll talk about monkey feet, because I just thought this was interesting. Now don't judge me on this, and I don't recommend you pick up these habits or even ask your doctor about them (I don't plan to). They might be unsafe, and I'm just sharing for entertainment. We all have those things we do in the privacy of our homes. I use my feet for a lot of grabbing, picking up, closing doors, etc, and I never realized how much I just do it instrinctually until I couldn't use my upper body as much. I want to emphasize, it's nothing unsanitary. I'm not reading a book and stirring a pot of soup with the laddle in between my toes and then dipping my toe in to taste it. 

But I've done this as far back as I can remmeber. For example, if there's a dirty shirt on the floor, and I'm too lazy to bend down, I'll literally grab it with my toes and bring it up to my hands. If I'm on the other side of a door that opens into a room and my hands are full, I'll hook my foot around the back of the door and pull it closed with my leg. I actually didn't realize I have this one habit until my car ride back from the hospital, but when I'm getting out of a car I almost exclusively pull the handle a little, and then use my foot to open the door from the bottom. This little oddity has made things a little more convenient while it's so hard to push, pull, and reach.

I think this will be last post for a bit. Unless I can think of something else I need to get off my chest ;), I may just post again next week with an update.",1,1733889413.0,valvereplacement,0,1.0,False

She lives about 4 hours from me, but for the past couple years has came to see me every Christmas for a couple days. I’ve only seen her once this year, back in May when she came to help me with my business while my business partner was out of town. In the past she’s visited me every couple months, but its slowly died down because of the man she is “seeing”.

She has been seeing this man for about 2 years now and let’s just say, he’s trouble. He’s very controlling, calls her names (one of his favorites is cunt) ghosts her randomly, and is currently going through a divorce. I feel like he kind of has something to do with her not coming.

She usually asks me what weekends I am busy prior to coming (I own a mobile coffee trailer) so weekends are a big one for me, and then she’ll plan accordingly and ask off from work. The girl has a ton of sick days, and never takes off, so I know she has time. 
 
However, she hasn’t talked about coming much lately. I think the last time I asked her, she said she was definitely coming, and nothing was going to stop her. 

Here’s my dilemma. I want to say something. If I do not, I know I’ll shut down and probably not talk for a while. Which understandably is not the right way to do things but you’ll understand here soon. If I do say something, she’ll get defensive and say “well you never come see me”. Which noted, I do not drive back to the town I went to high school in, got in a lot of trouble in, and have no connections whatsoever to that place. I also, do not have a reliable car. My car is about to burn out, seriously. I own a 2012 car that idles at stop lights. I would borrow my hubbys truck, but he uses it for work on the weekdays, and my business uses it on the weekends. I’m at a loss for words here. Another thing, I am married, I have a house, animals, and a business responsibilities here. My best friend lives at home and works a 8-5. I feel like she’s not wanting to come because she’s waiting on that one chance she’ll see her man, but not her man. If I say that, she’s say that’s not the reason and I just know it’ll be an argument. He lives almost an hour away from her and she’d jump at the chance to see him, but he won’t drive to see her. He does nothing for her and she’s in love with him.

I don’t know, I just don’t know how I’d go about this because I know she’ll say I never come see her. But how do I know she won’t just ditch me to go see him. 

Someone please help,

1hbksph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1hbksph/quick_hex_mundi_review/,Quick Hex Mundi Review,"I impulsively bought some samples from Hex Mundi for the first time on Black Friday. I thought I would share some quick initial reactions. I am a complete newbie so sorry for the possibly uncultered takes. 

**Death by Stereo** (Electricity+Vampire Boy+Vintage Leather) - Super unisex spicy leather scent. Dries down a good bit sweeter but very subtle. (9/10)

**Buckley** (Tobacco Flower+Water+Musk+Coffee+Lilacs) - I really really wanted to like this one but all I got was coffee soaked wet dog. (2/10)

**The Wolfman** (Moss+Juniper+Blackberries+Leather+Wolsbanr) - Another stunning unisex scent. A nice dark berry scent that isn't too sweet. Reminds me of Alkemia's As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved but a little better. (8/10)

**Nosferatu** (Blood Accord+Vetiver+Clove+ Chrysanthemum+Patchouli) - This is my first fragrance with a blood note and I am obsessed. This is the goth night scent of my dreams. Like a Type O Negative song was made into a fragrance. Super unisex and sharply spicy. Easy 10 if it lasted slightly longer on my skin (9.5/10)

**Ogre** (Blood+Leather+Frankincense+Myrrh) - Reminds me a lot of Nosferatu so if you were ordering for the first time I may do one or the other. This one is slightly more 'perfumey' and clean, but similar vibe. (8.5/10)

**Bloodletting** (Clove+Patchouli) - Goes on weirdly green but don't let it confuse you. This is a PERFECT Djarum/clove cigarette fragrance (which is what I am constantly searching for). (9.5/10) 

**Demiurge** (Musk+Botanicals+Blood+Creation) - I really can't place my finger on this one. It is incredibly interesting and I love 90% of it, but there is a weird, rubbery sweetness that I am not a huge enjoyer of. I am going to return to this one for sure. (6/10)

**Saudade** (Hinoki Wood+Musk+Cedar+Mint+Thyme+Benzoin+Vanilla+Olibanum) - I absolutely love the mint in this. It isn't a super clean-smelling, headachey, in-your-face artificial mint, but more like the fresh leaf. The musk and cedar are beautiful in this. (8.5/10)

**Lotus-Eater** (Lotus+Clary Sage+Rain+Coriander+Cypress+Incense+Immortelle Petals) - There is something about this that I really dislike. There is an herbiness that I am drawn to, but there is something that is creating a chocolate-adjacent note in here? I have no clue how to describe it but it is not great. (2.5/10)

**Stone Roses** (Roses+Saffron+Tonacco+Cement+Citrus Fruits) - Citrus dominant but not offensive at all. More clean than sweet. I could see this being a great layering option with something a little smokier to bring out those notes (7/10)

*Freebies* 

**Dragoste** (Warm Vanilla+Sugar+Chrysanthemum Nectar+Black Earth) - DIRTY ROTTEN CANDY. Lollipop dropped in mud. True to the notes but I am a huge sweet-scent hater. (1/10)

**Dr. Phibes** (Hinoki Wood+Black Currant+Leather+Brandy+Fig) - I think it is the hinoki wood I am getting but reminds me of a fir-forward holiday scent. Great unisex Autumn option but a little uninteresting (5/10)

**The Big Heat** (Intense Hawthorn+Bergamont+Violet Leaf+Tobacco) - The violet is so dominant in this. A little too feminine and perfumey for me but I could easily see this working really well for someone else. (3.5/10)

  
Overall I was so pleasantly surprised. I actually bought the full sizes of **Nosferatu** and **The Wolfman** during this order and I am so glad I did. The lasting time/projection isn't the best, but I am going to experiment by layering with the Alkemia noir fixative. I would 100% recommend Hex Mundi, especially if you're more alternative and prefer unisex scents. ",6,1733889097.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False
1hbkslp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1hbkslp/obsessed_with_feeling_good/,Obsessed with feeling good,"Hi All,

As I have been preparing for my 2025 no buy and doing a dry run this month, I’ve been reflecting a lot on why I buy things. I concluded the following:

1. I buy clothes that I think will make me feel fit/skinny
2. I buy makeup and skincare that i think will make me prettier
3. I pay for meals/food/coffees so i can spend time with people 

I still want to feel all of these things, but I just need to take a different approach:

1. Clothes: I have been doing Pilates and it has been making me feel great about my body. I don’t need new clothes to feel good because I feel just as good in the ones I already do have now. My classes are a payment that I will continue throughout 2025, because it’s important to me. However, no more clothes. Also since I’ve been eating most of my meals at home, I feel much healthier. 
2. Makeup/skincare: I already have enough of everything so I will use what I have. Instead of getting the high from paying for something and then not using it, I will start grabbing the things I already have and using them. I’ve already started to notice a difference here and I have been taking care of myself more consistently (moisturizing every night without fail, for example). 
3. Food: I don’t always need to do activities with friends that require spending money. I will start suggesting free social activities like hosting them, going to the park/museum/etc. I still want the social interactions but without the spending. 


I found this a helpful way to think about why I want to spend and thought I’d share in case it helps anyone else :)",6,1733889087.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False

She is under my watchful eye, I’m always within reach & very aware of our surroundings. I’m curious what your experience is like taking your babies out & about. How do strangers treat you? My experience has been overall amazing, most people love seeing her toddle about. They are interested in witnessing a child explore! I’m sure it also reminds them of their own children. Sometimes we get side eyed but typically people eventually come around & loosen up. It feels that in western society babies are to be seen but not heard. That they must have proper etiquette with no room for error! As if they should function like tiny adults lol. I always say that loud babies are happy babies! She loves the sound of her own voice & is strengthening her vocabulary everyday. Sometimes we make messes with our meals but no one has complained, we love going out for tea parties! I’ve been given a lot of grace by complete strangers when she oversteps & I’m grateful for that.

Hello all. I (24F) recently had a bout of food poisoning that I recovered from but haven't felt at 100% since. Since then I have had periods where I'm feeling okay, to having seemingly random days where I can't move because of stomach cramps, pain, bloating, discomfort, stuck to the toilet, etc. I am pretty sure I have PI-IBS but unfortunately it is a bit difficult at the moment to get in to see a doctor. I have no insurance and am about to start a new job after being unemployed so I really can't afford to start seeing one right now. I know this diet is usually done under their advice, but I'm desperate for relief at this point and anxious about how this may effect my job performance. 
I am considering trying a low fodmap diet temporarily to see if it helps alleviate my symptoms. My plan is to try low fodmap for 4 weeks to see if there is any improvement while I try save up to get in to be seen. An obstacle that I am running into is that I don't really have a way to cook much - my family unit is currently living in converted tiny homes while we wait for land surveys to be done so we can put an actual house here. Our diet has been fast food, ordering pizzas, and microwavable meals for the better part of a year which I know has not been helping my gut to begin with.
I've been researching what low fodmap foods are for a little while but it all feels a bit overwhelming. In addition to not having a kitchen, I also grew up very sheltered so my ability to know how to make actual foods has a lot of room to grow. I'm also on the spectrum and have a lot of food sensitivities/pickiness. A lot of my safe foods are high in fodmap. Thankfully I've found some fruits/vegetables that I like are low fodmap foods so I have those as options. However I'm really wanting an actual meal. I know chicken and eggs are options as well but again, I don't have a way to cook them myself to ensure theres no added high-fodmap ingredients... Are there any safe pre-cooked options anywhere?? Is that even a thing for low fodmap? I'm at a loss and hoping you guys can help me, maybe some advice for a beginner to this diet or some really simple recipes that don't require the use of a stove/conventional oven. The items I have to work with are a microwave and one of those 3-in-1 coffee pot/toaster oven/griddle machines. Thank you all in advance and sorry for the word vomit.

I’m not saying that’s not ridiculous, but it’s just a fight we aren’t willing to have.

-Frogs
-Jimmy Buffett
-Cricut (the craft machine, I bought her a machine last Christmas)
-Obsessed with crafting and DIY
-Anything fancy/flashy that she can show off to people

I would prefer if the machine could do cold brew or something for iced coffee because that's my wife and I's favorite to make. The only thing is it takes awhile to make with our current setup (putting the coffee in the freezer for an hour or so). 

My kitchen is fairly small but I do have enough room for a lot of the machines I've seen online. Here's a pic of where the machine would go, replacing the existing setup: https://imgur.com/a/iV1Gfyx

I'd probably prefer an electric machine, but I don't have a strong preference. I'll be honest, I've only really looked at the Breville BES970XL Espresso machine because it fits my budget exactly.",1,1733888034.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

However, the whole place smells. Like to where some people leave. 

I asked the wonder and he suggested me telling her that they have an offensive odor. 

I am fine with confrontation, but I really hate to hurt peoples feelings.

1hbkfx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lowfodmaprecipes/comments/1hbkfx1/looking_for_extremely_easy_to_make_low_fodmap/,Looking for extremely easy to make low fodmap recipes,"Hello all. I (24F) recently had a bout of food poisoning that I recovered from but haven't felt at 100% since. Since then I have had periods where I'm feeling okay, to having seemingly random days where I can't move because of stomach cramps, pain, bloating, discomfort, stuck to the toilet, etc. I am pretty sure I have PI-IBS but unfortunately it is a bit difficult at the moment to get in to see a doctor. I have no insurance and am about to start a new job after being unemployed so I really can't afford to start seeing one right now. I know this diet is usually done under their advice, but I'm desperate for relief at this point and anxious about how this may effect my job performance. 
I am considering trying a low fodmap diet temporarily to see if it helps alleviate my symptoms. My plan is to try low fodmap for 4 weeks to see if there is any improvement while I try save up to get in to be seen. An obstacle that I am running into is that I don't really have a way to cook much - my family unit is currently living in converted tiny homes while we wait for land surveys to be done so we can put an actual house here. Our diet has been fast food, ordering pizzas, and microwavable meals for the better part of a year which I know has not been helping my gut to begin with.
I've been researching what low fodmap foods are for a little while but it all feels a bit overwhelming. In addition to not having a kitchen, I also grew up very sheltered so my ability to know how to make actual foods has a lot of room to grow. I'm also on the spectrum and have a lot of food sensitivities/pickiness. A lot of my safe foods are high in fodmap. Thankfully I've found some fruits/vegetables that I like are low fodmap foods so I have those as options. However I'm really wanting an actual meal. I know chicken and eggs are options as well but again, I don't have a way to cook them myself to ensure theres no added high-fodmap ingredients... Are there any safe pre-cooked options anywhere?? Is that even a thing for low fodmap? I'm at a loss and hoping you guys can help me, maybe some advice for a beginner to this diet or some really simple recipes that don't require the use of a stove/conventional oven. The items I have to work with are a microwave and one of those 3-in-1 coffee pot/toaster oven/griddle machines. Thank you all in advance and sorry for the word vomit.

1hbkc2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hbkc2c/fn_home_spirit_home/,[FN] “Home Spirit Home,"“Home Spirit Home” 

	“Till death do us part but death does not separate the body from it’s spirit,” Aunt Esme would tell me as a child when I would become gloomy about the chickens she would have to slaughter for dinner. “We always thank them for their company and presence as this chicken understands the purpose it will serve.”
	“But I don’t want to eat it,” I would cry, watching her pluck the feathers from its flesh. White and brown feathers were scattered on the ground in the yard outside of the shed where Esme would keep her equipment. 
	“Now child,” she would whispfully say. “You will one day soon understand when you grow with your age.”
	I understand now. I sat in a chair, hunched over the side of a bed, holding the hand with the body of what was once Aunt Esme. She laid there peacefully in what looked like to be the deepest sleep known, which it was indeed. Tears streamed down my cheek as I caressed her hand with my thumb, thinking of all of the memories I shared with her. 
	The room was silent, too silent. I could hear the nurses' shoes clipping and clacking on the tile floors in the hallways outside as I tried to control my composure in this bleak gray room. A subtle knock was at the door but I never turned to direct my attention to the door. 
	“The doctors are going to take her away in a few minutes,” said my mother’s voice behind me. She walked to the foot of the bed and placed her hand on the frame. “She was gone too soon.” 
	She was. She is. She is gone. 
	Her black curly hair rested upon the white pillows that she was laying on. Her skin was losing color but it still did not mask the fact that she had been kissed by the sun. Her eyes were a blank canvas waiting to be painted with the bright, sky blue shimmery eyeshadow that she wore every day. Her hand still holding mine, lacked the glistening silver rings that crowded her fingers. The joy, the laughter, the love, the happiness, it was all gone. 
	“I never thought I would be here, seeing her, for my last and final time,” I wobbly said through my tears. I rested her hand back onto the bed. My mother walked behind me and placed her hand on my shoulder. 
	“She will always be remembered,” she reassured me. 
	A few, long, dreary days passed as my mother and I made the arrangements for the funeral. My mother, Claire, spent her time making tedious phone calls to family and friends about the passing of Aunt Esme. I, on the other hand, spent my time at the funeral home making sure that everything was up to par. 
	“Esme sure was a spirit,” said an older man who was too plump for his own good. He was wheeling in a cart full of light pink candles and lilies that would be on display. Esme would have been distraught over the flowers as they were ‘picked for the looks and not for the love.’ The parlor room cried in sadness as the walls were bleak from all of the deaths they had to witness. Aunt Esme would be presented at the back of the room where visitors could see her. 
	“She sure was,” I replied, checking off my task list. The old man pursed his lips and lowered his head, reminiscing and grieving about the loss. I could feel my throat becoming tighter and my face becoming flushed. I exited the room to find Loraine, the lawyer. Loarine had been working on deciphering Esme’s will as she had no children or husband to leave anything behind.
	Down the hall of the home was a small office where Loraine was working. I subtly knocked on the frame of the door to announce my presence. She nodded her head to welcome me in. Her reading glasses sat on the tip of her skinny nose as she peered over them at me. 
	“We have some business to discuss,” she replied, setting the will down and removing her glasses. “Your mother will be here shortly.”
	Business as usual but this was no business that should have happened this soon. It felt just like yesterday I was going to her house and watching her bead a new top in her living room. She would tell more stories and adventures about how she packed her belongings in a single suitcase and traveled the whole world. 
	“Why,” she said, stringing a bead onto the thread. “I lived out of my suitcase because what more could I possibly need?”
	“But Esme,” I would challenge, “What about all of the trinkets and toys you would bring back?”
	She gave the gentle smile she always did before she enlightened me with more stories. “I have my ways.”
	A few minutes passed and it felt like it was raining in the office. Except, it was me who was creating the rainy atmosphere. I came back to reality and wiped my face of the tears that I had shed thinking about Esme. My mother entered the room, wiping her hands on her dress as she took a seat beside me in front of Loraine’s desk.
	“Ladies,” she said, flipping the will over towards us. “There are only two things that have been left behind for you.”
	I looked up at my mother who was looking intently at the piece of paper that had Esme’s handwriting on it. 
	“Well,” my mother hesitantly expressed, “what is it?” 
	“She has only left her money and home to Aurora.” 
	The world stopped. I quickly flashed my attention to the will on the table. My mother relaxed in disbelief after hearing the news. I quickly snatched the paper off the desk and skimmed my eyes over Esme’s curvy handwriting. ‘All of my estate and wealth will go to Aurora,’ I read. My heart was jumping out of my chest. This couldn’t be. My mother was supposed to get everything. Esme was her sister after all–
	“Under one condition,” Loraine interrupted my train of thought. I looked over the paper back at her. What condition? My mother was back on the edge of her seat again, her posture waiting for more news. “You have to live in the house, Aurora.”
	“This can’t be,” I exclaimed, looking back down at the will. “She shouldn’t have given anything to me. This should all have gone to my mother.”  
“A will is a will,” said Loriane. “I cannot change what has been written down as it is practically laws and gifts to and from the dead.”
	I quickly read the paper again from the start. “All of my estate and wealth will go to Aurora.  To Aurora, when you read this, do not be alarmed or upset with this choice as it is mine. To Claire, do not hold any grudge against your daughter as she was one of my own. With my wealth, I have accumulated $500,000 which will be granted to Aurora. With great wealth comes some type of responsibility. Aurora, my estate is yours in which you have to live till your passing. My home is special, spiritual some may say, but I know with your care, tender love, and kindness, my home will grant you the life you deserve.”
	“I suggest that you follow her will, Aurora. We see time and time again those who have been given money, estate, or personal belongings with special requests that do not follow them,” Loraine gently reminded me. She folded her hands on the desk and directed her attention to my mother who seemed to be grieving more than just the loss of her sister. Mother, slumped into the cushion chair, was fiddling her fingers in her lap. “Claire, I suggest the same for you as well. What’s done is done.”
	“But Loraine,” my mother leaned forward. “She couldn’t just give away her home like that. It’s a hundred years old and is not in proper upkeep to be lived in.”
	“Then, take the money and make it a home,” Loraine suggested. She backed her chair up and gathered her belongings scattered on the desk. “I think it is my time to part. I am sorry for your loss, Claire. Esme was loved by all.”
	My mind was running faster than a racing horse who had the highest bets placed on them. I watched Loraine wish my mother well and exit the room. My mother excused herself and followed behind Loraine. Knowing that this is what Aunt Esme wanted, I knew I needed to fulfill her will. 
~~~
	Spring blossomed into summer and Esme’s home remained empty until I had collected her share of wealth she had left me. I spent the following week packing, cleaning, and donating all of my belongings into a trunk that fit into the back of my mothers automobile. Up the mountain, I went to live in my new home. 
	Aunt Esme always loved the drive up the mountain when she would come pick me up for a weekend trip. She would talk about how the farmer who lived a few miles up would sell blueberries at his stand where his son would watch it, day in and day out. She laughed and thought the boy playing watchguard was silly as no man would dare to steal from the farmer. The passing town was small enough to know who the thief would be. When I rode by the old stand to see his son, he was a bit older now with a woman who he held his arm tightly around like his most prized possession. I chuckled to myself, thinking about how Esme would be proud of that boy to find himself a nice girl. 
	Upon arriving at Esme’s house, mother parked the car in the overgrown gravel drive that led up to the two story house. We both looked at the home and mother sighed. 
	“It is going to be odd knowing that Esme doesn’t live here anymore,” she said, fixing her white lacy gloves on her hands. “I know she appreciates you doing this.”
	“I don’t want to hear her in heaven complaining about how they tore her house down to build a new shopping center,” I joked. Mother chuckled to herself.
	We both got out of the car and hauled my belongings to the front porch of the house. Esme’s house was old but sturdy. The sky blue paint had been peeling off the siding and one of the steps leading up to the porch broke under me as I was climbing the wooden steps. Wildflowers and weeds blossomed in the flowerbeds and hanging baskets enjoying their new homes they invaded. The windows were coated with dust and cobwebs were neatly strung under the porch. Her home was still the same as I could always remember. 
	“I think that is all,” my mother said, placing the last box down on the porch. “I guess it is my time to head back down the mountain.” 
	“Indeed it is,” I said, bringing her into a hug. “I will see you next weekend?”
	“Yes, I’ll be back with your car.”
	“I love you,” I reminded her.
	“I love you too.”
	I watched mother back out of the drive into the road until she was swallowed by the trees in the bend of the road. I turned to the front door and searched for the key in my purse. The home was old and so was the key. I found the black skeleton key and inserted it into the brown wooden door that cried a screeching creak when it opened. Inside, the home was dark, cold and lifeless. A bubble of tears started to build up in my eyes but I pushed the feeling down. I walked inside to be greeted with a home that was clean and unbothered. To the left was the kitchen and to the right, the living room and directly in front of me was the staircase that I would run up and down as a kid. I started to move my belongings in, one box at a time, to officially move into my new home that was once Esme’s. 
	A couple of hours had passed and the sun was starting to set, I had unpacked my essential belongings into Esme’s old bedroom. Her queen sized bed seemed small in her enormous room. Floral wallpaper lined the walls along with different sized lanterns and candles scattered in the room. As old as this home is, it still had running water and electricity. I walked to the closet where Esme kept all of her flashy clothes. As a child, she always dressed up in colorful, complex pattern clothing compared to the others plain, simplistic style.  
	“You always want to stand out because blending in is how you lose yourself,” she would remind me. Of course, I looked up to Esme in such a way that I wore a bright yellow dress with royal purple stockings to school. Girls in my class would laugh, point, joke and even throw scrunched up paper at me with hateful notes. I cried to Esme about the girls in my class and she simply told me, “Your spirit is free unlike theirs.” 
	I opened the dark oak door and was greeted with a closet packed neatly with clothes making the walls almost impossible to see. I skimmed through the clothes debating what I should do with them. I had to make space for my own. I quickly started to sort through them, throwing the ones I didn't want into a pile behind me and keeping the ones I wanted on the rack. Colors of cloth flew to the left and right of me as I kept tossing. After a few minutes, I turned around to look at the damage I had created. 
	There was nothing. The pile of clothes had disappeared. 
	“That cannot be right,” I quickly said to myself, walking to the place where the pile should have been. I searched around in the closet looking for the pile. “Someone couldn't have worn them and walked away.”
	I turned back to the rack of clothes but only to find some hangers hanging with some of the clothes on them. I stared at the hangers that were swinging back and forth as if someone or something had rushed to hang them up. I closed my eyes and shook my head. 
	“Maybe some rest will do me good,” I said, walking out of the closet, losing the door behind me. “I think this could be a part of the grieving process.” 
~~~
	Daylight leaked in through the curtains the next morning waking me. The sound of the rooster crowing reminded me of all of the animals that Aunt Esme had been taking care of. The farmer from down the mountain had been watching them for Esme while she was gone. Is gone. I gathered myself and headed downstairs to the kitchen. The kitchen was the smallest room in the large house. A white stove and refrigerator were hugged by the sea blue and sage green tiled countertops. Pots and vases lined the window sill with different flowers and plants that Esme had placed there. Many meals were served and shared here and many more to come since this is my new home now. 
	Esme’s old coffee percolator was sitting on the stove where it had always sat for as long as I could remember. 
	“Coffee,” I hummed to myself. “That’s what I need. Today’s going to be a long day.” 
I opened the lid to the percolator to spot a little creature who was asleep in the corner of the pot, a frog. 
	“How'd you get in here little buddy?” I asked the frog, reaching down to pick him up. 
	“I hopped right in here,” a voice said. I quickly looked behind me in the kitchen, scanning to see who else was here. Nothing. The empty, still kitchen stared back at me. 
	“Who’s there?” I asked more frantically. “Show yourself.”
	“I'm right in front of you,” the unknown voice claimed. 
	I zipped my head to look outside of the window to see if someone was on the porch. Nobody. I set down the percolator and grabbed the nearest item to me that could be used as a potential weapon, a frying pan. I opened the back door that led to the wrap around porch and stepped outside. I looked to the left, nothing. I looked to the right, nobody. I lowered the pan to my side and relaxed. This has to be a figment of my imagination. I walked back into the house and locked the door behind me. I set the pan back on the stove and drew my attention back to the percolator. I picked up the tiny lime green frog from the percolator and set him on the stove, praying he wouldn't hop off before I could take him outside. I walked to the sink to wash out the percolator. 
	“So you're the new squatter, I see,” the voice said again. I looked behind me and down at the frog, realizing the potential source of the mysterious voice. 
	“Did you just talk?” I asked the little frog. The frog moved itself to face the direction of me and slowly blinked one eye at a time. 
	“A ribbit or croak, I do speak,” the frog said back. 
	“This can't be,” I denied, walking towards the stove top. “I haven't talked to an animal since I was a child.”
	“Childlike qualities never leave.”
	“But–,” I stopped. “You're a frog?”
	“I think that's what I am,” the frog said, but this time, the frog was starting to stand on its back legs. I took a step back, taken away by the moment. “But you see, some things are never as they seem. My name is Robert.”
	My mind was running through the countless diagnoses I could have for this current moment. Was I delusional? Sleep deprived? Physically exhausted? A frog is talking, standing on its two legs, and introducing himself to me. 
	“You're not real,” I reassured myself. “You're not real at all.”
	“Of course I am. Let me prove it,” the frog said, getting closer now. “Do you remember the time when you were a kid that you accidentally fell down the stairs while Esme was making your favorite breakfast. What was it? Oh, yes! Blueberry pancakes with eggs. Anywho, that is why you have the scar on your left hand. You slipped down the stairs on an old sock that Esme had lost.” 
I paused and intently looked at the frog, squinting my eyes, “How did you know that?”
	“I have always been around, you know. I come in various forms and various figures that you may have not realized.” 
	I felt like I was going to faint onto the cold kitchen floor. There was no possible way that I was standing here with a talking frog in front of me who kindly introduced himself. The frog started to wipe his face with this little green webbed hand. 
	“Am I-I- dreaming?” I asked.
	“I don’t think you are,” he replied, looking around the kitchen. “I think we are alive and well.” He was examining his hands to verify that he was awake as well. 
	I pinched myself on my arm. The sharp sting was intense and then slowly faded out. I am here and I am not dreaming. 
	“I told you now,” the frog said, hopping onto the counter top. He was walking over to the window sill with all of the plants and vases. I watched him intently. It was so strange to see that he was hopping but on both of his back hind legs. “We are all alive and well.”
	“How are you talking to me though?”
	“Well,” he replied, looking at the dried dead flowers in a vase. “I am a spirit.”
	“Spirit?”
	“Yes. I come in various forms. I start as something and then I become something new when I am passed on.”
	“Reincarnated?”
	“Reincarnated.”
	“Who were you before being a frog?” 
	“Peculiar thing,” he said, turning around and placing his slimy green finger to his little frog chin. “I do not know who I was but I still have all of the memories from when I was in the past. I do not remember how I became a frog nor will I know when I become another spirit.”
	“Interesting,” I replied back. I was searching through my memories of who Robert could have been before he was a little green frog. “Does Esme know about you?”
	“Of course she knows about us.”
	“Us?”
	The frog then took a seat on the ledge of the window and crossed his legs. He leaned on his left arm to support his little green body. “There are plenty of us who are settled in this home.”
	“Where are they at then?”
	“They will come around.”
~~~
	Robert hopped along with me all day throughout the house as I finished unpacking all of my possessions into Esme’s home. I questioned him, as I was curious as to how long he has been around and where he has traveled. He told me that he doesn’t have an age and has always lived in this home. Knowing that there were other spirits in the house, I was on edge and searching for the next one I may encounter. 
	Around noon I sat at the breakfast nook and made a list of all of the repairs that I was going to need to do to the house. Since I was going to have to live here for the rest of my life, it was ideal of me to put Esme’s money back into the home. Robert watched me make the list intently, almost as if I was going to quiz him about what was on the list. 
	“Have you ever thought about just letting the wind take you where you need to go?” Robert asked. I kept writing on the notepad of tasks.
	“No,” I replied, scratching out ‘Grass Seed’ on the list. “I’m a planner.”
	“Not Esme,” the frog replied. “She was much like you when she was your age. She always planned and always stressed.”
	“There isn’t much I can do to change that now,” I said back. I finished the list and ripped the sheet from the notepad. I placed the note on the refrigerator and placed my hands on my hips. “Time to go to the shed.” 
	“Take me!” Robert cried out. “I haven’t been in the sunshine since Esme left. I have been stuck in that cold, dark percolator. Though, I did get the best rest my spirit bones have ever had.”
	I picked the frog up and cupped him in my hand. We walked outside and down to the shed that was in the backyard. The shed was built by Esme using scraps of different types of wood to build the walls and sheet metal for the roof. The door was a huge oak door that she had installed when I was ten. She said that having a nice door to open will always make entering the room more magical. I set Robert down on top of an upside down terracotta pot. I opened the door to the shed and was met with darkness, dust, old gardening tools, and broken planter pots. I took a step into the shed and it was magical. 
	The inside of the shed was nothing like what I had seen before I walked in. Different shades of blue swirled all around me as I was being sucked into the shed. Light scents of lavender and vanilla filled the air as I took another step in. 
	“Hello?” I asked out into the void. With a talking frog, who knew something so minuscule about me, I would not be surprised if another talking animal appeared. 
	“Esme?” a deep voice called out. 
	“She isn’t here anymore,” I replied back. A big rush of wind blew in my face, blowing my brown hair out of my face. “My name is Aurora. I am her niece.”
	“Aurora…” the name said softly, almost reminiscing about a fond memory with my name. The blue swirls quickly moved at lightspeed and I was pulled by my waist quickly. I let out a scream and tried to turn around and watched as the shed door close. I shut my eyes and moved my arms in front of my face to protect myself from anything that I may be hurled into. I felt myself come to an abrupt stop and the wind calmed around me. I slowly put my arms down to my side and opened my eyes, fearing where I may be. 
	I was inside what looked to be a library or a study. The room was dark lit and the walls were filled with books of all different shapes and sizes. The fireplace was lit with a wingback chair sitting in front of it. Warmth and the scent of vanilla were stronger compared to earlier when I entered the shed. 
	“Come in,” the deep voice stated. 
	I could feel my heart rate starting to increase as I inched closer to the chair. Step by step I noticed a long orange bird's beak peeking from behind one of the chair wings. As I kept rounding the corner, the bird-like man was sitting in the chair, staring at the fire in front of him. His orange thick narrow beak clashed with the navy blue shimmery feathers that framed his face. His eyes were emerald green that were set almost too perfectly on his face. This creature was more human than I anticipated as I kept observing him. 
	“It’s been awhile,” said the man. He slowly turned his head towards my direction. “Please, sit.” 
	I looked around the room for a chair before the blue swirls reappeared again in a cloud-like shape to reveal a purple velvet chair. I took a seat in the chair while still examining the man. His broad shoulders filled the back of the chair with his winged arms resting in his lap. His legs resemble those of a heron. He caught a glimpse of me looking at his features. I quickly looked away. 
	“It has been forever since I have seen you,” he said in his low alluring voice. “Esme has a beautiful niece.”
 	“I am not sure who you are,” I stated. He turned his head to the right a little with a nod. 
	“My name is Gil. I watch over the house. I keep the peace and bring happiness hence the name.”
	“Gil,” I repeated. “I have never seen you before.”
	“No one sees me,” he said, uncrossing his legs in his chair. “I am meant to be hidden but always there.”
	“Are you a spirit?”
	“I am. I have been this spirit for as long as I can remember,” he stood up from his chair. He was tall, built, bold, and muscular. He slowly walked behind his chair with his wings behind his back. “This way.”
	I obeyed. I followed Gil into a hallway that was filled with picture frames from various places in them. He kept his pace even to allow me some time to peak into the frames. Pictures of hillsides, castles, bars, homes, children, parents, couples, and families were shown in these frames. I couldn’t help thinking of Esme and the pictures that were in her house. Specifically, a painting that she created when she was visiting England before I was born. I would spend hours staring at the painting, admiring every detail. 
	Gil stopped at the end of the hallway and reached for the doorknob. He opened the door and stepped to the side to let me through first. I peered through the door frame and saw the blue swirls appear again. 
	“Go through,” he said, nodding his head. “This will take you to the shed.”
I looked up at him and back at the door. I took a deep breath and stepped forward. One foot was through the door and I felt the pull around my waist again. The next thing I could recollect, I was in the shed that I was first greeted with before entering into the magical world. I turned around to see if Gil was standing behind me with the door opened but I was met with the door to the real outside world. I quickly scanned the room to check the equipment that I would use in the renovations. I turned back around and opened the door, praying it would take me to reality. I was correct. 
	Robert was still sitting on the pot but holding a daisy flower to protect him from the sun. He quickly jumped to his feet. I closed the door behind me and I was met with the backyard of Esme’s house. 
	“You’re back!” he cheered. “I guess you met Gil?”
	“I did,” I responded. I touched my face to make sure that I, myself, hadn’t turned into a man bird. “Gil.”
	“Did you find what you were looking for?” Robert asked, seeming unbothered that I had just encountered another spirit. 
	“Oh,” I said, looking down at Robert. I scooped him up in my hands. “Yes.”
	“Excellent!”
	We both headed back into the house. Maybe Esme had a reason to keep living here all along. 
~~~
	As the sun set behind the clouds, Robert was nowhere to be found. I had tidied up the kitchen and dining area, sorting through all of the chipped plates and cups. Esme had a collection of cups that were light blue with little white flowers painted on them. She had them stored away at the top of the cupboard. I placed them on the dining table to help bring some type of life to the house besides me, Robert, and Gil, who was out in the shed. 
	I still became weary of opening up cupboards, flipping over tea cups, and opening containers as I was scared to meet another spirit. Robert was nice company in this lonely house. I checked the clock on the wall to see the time was little after nine. I stopped working for the night and headed upstairs to my room. 
	Robert was sitting outside of the door in the hallway in front of my room but this time, he looked like a normal frog. I scooped him up in my hand and placed him on the dresser adjacent to the bed. 
	“Time for some shut eye?” he asked, positioning himself on the dresser so his feet could dangle off the ledge. I walked to the closest to gather my night wear. 
	“I suppose it is,” I shouted back so he could hear me. I searched for my large suitcase that held all of my night gowns and other odd and ends clothing. The closet was still the same as the last time I was in here. I scanned the floor of the closet to find my suitcase until I noticed there was a small beaten brown leather suitcase sitting upright, perfectly in the middle of the room. Cuts, scratches, and tears were detailing the age and use of the suitcase. I heard a small thud in the bedroom and quick little slapping feet on the floor in my direction. 
	“It finally made its appearance,” said Robert, who was striding over towards me. 
	“It’s?” I asked, turning my attention towards the suitcase. What other possibilities could there be that could come from this house? I inched closer to the suitcase to lift it up by the little gold handle on the top of it. The weight of the suitcase was lighter than expected but there was definitely something in here. 
	“Yes, it’s,” croaked Robert. “Open, you will see.”
	I set the suitcase on a small end table that Esme with a lamp on to illuminate her gigantic closet. I flipped both of the gold latches and started to lift the lid. A small light was shining intensely from the inside and crept its way out. As I kept opening the lid, my eyes started to squint from the intensity of the light. Soon, I had to close them. I held up my right hand over my eyes to shield the white light until I realized I was in an empty field. 
	The bright light had disappeared and it was dark outside. I turned around, scanning the field to find where I had been mysteriously dropped off at. The moon was casting just enough light for me to see when I noticed, this is where Esme’s house used to be. I looked back in front of me to find the leather suitcase sitting there with Robert on top. 
	“What happened to the house?!” I asked frantically. 
	“It’s all in here,” Robert replied back, tapping his webbed hand on top of the suitcase. “You packed the house up.” 
	“Packed the house up?!” I exclaimed, stooping over Robert now. I quickly picked up him and held him in my left hand and pointed at him with my right finger. “You better tell  me how to unpack this house!”
	“Easy there, Aurora!” he jumped back a bit in my hand, holding up his two slimy hands. “The house is unpackable. Just give me a second to explain.”
	I paused my frustration as I lowered my finger down from Robert's little face. He was right, Esme wasn’t here to explain the mysteries of the house. Robert was left here for me. I sat down in the field next to the suitcase and placed Robert back in the same space I had moved him from.
	“I apologize,” I quietly said. “It’s been a long day and learning how this house works has been making me feel mad. More than mad, delusional.”
	“I understand,” said Robert, now laying on his back with his arms crossed, resting his head on them. “Things seem scary when we are not certain as to what it is.” 
I nodded.
	“Esme was about your age when she found this house. I was still here but I cannot remember what I was at the time. I could have been this suitcase that I’m currently laying on but I cannot recall a memory. Anywho, Esme found the suitcase with her sister before they packed for a trip to go across the country to see her father. She loved the simplicity of the suitcase and wanted to paint it to make it her own. So, this is what she got.” He tapped the suitcase again. “She didn’t know that there was a house that was stashed in this suitcase until she got home and started to pack. The bright light took her in and landed her right here in this same exact spot, with a house of course.”
	I looked around the field again as Robert was telling me about the house. The house, the small shed, and the chicken coop were missing but the gravel driveway was still in the same place. I remember my mother telling me a story about how Esme had disappeared for a few days and would mysteriously reappear again. With mother’s story and Robert’s story, together it made sense. Mother used to say that Esme would disappear at times and cause a lot of trouble for her parents. 
	“As Esme got older, she decided it was her time to inhabit the home that she had. She moved into the home and moved it with her too. She could take the home with her anywhere she pleased as long as she had this suitcase. She traveled the world and saw all of the endless possibilities that she could take on. She understood the purpose of the house and the purpose of herself. That is why she always seemed to understand the way of life.”
	“What about the spirits?” I asked. 
	“Some had already lived here and some she found on her travels. Gil has always lived here and so have I. The others, not so much.”
	“Where are the others?” 
	“They are around. They will show up. Some of them go when they please so it is hard to know if they are around or not. Spirits are just as free as humans are but they never go away, even after death.”
	“I had no idea that Esme had all of this,” I said, shaking my head at the thought. “It always seemed magical here and she had so many stories to tell. Why did I never think of this before?”
	“Some painted Esme out to be mad and some painted her out to be a free spirit. I say she is anything and everything she desired to be,” Robert said, standing up. 
I kept looking around at the empty field, taking in and processing everything that Robert had been telling me. The field was peaceful as Robert and I sat out here. I felt at peace. A shadow moved out from behind a tree and my attention was focused on it. It was Gil. He was standing, watching, protecting the home and the land. 
	“Oh,” Robert turned. “Hey, Gil!” He waved his green hand out at Gil who nodded his head in return. Gil disappeared back into the darkness of the woods.
	“Who else knows about my home?” I asked. I noticed I said ‘my’ instead of Esme.
	“No one but us,” said Robert. “Not even your mother knows.”
	“I see,” I replied back, but I understood. Esme wanted to protect her peace but her spirit. That is why she always seemed so free. She never had to worry about anyone or anything intruding on her.
	“Now that the home is yours, you’re free to do whatever you please. I just live here, so does Gil, and we are your spirits.”
	“How do I get back home or even travel?”
	“Easy,” he said, sticking out his long pink slimy tongue to catch a small bug floating around him. He missed. “You just state the place you want to go and open up the suitcase. The same light will appear and you will be in your destination before you know it. Just keep the suitcase with you. You cannot get back home if you do not have it. To return home, simply open it up without saying anything. The suitcase somehow knows that it is a secret code to get back home.”
	“That doesn’t seem so difficult,”I said, laying back into the grass, looking up at the stars that were sparkling in the navy blue sky. This is my home. This is where I belong. I understand why Esme wanted me to have her home because she knew I’d love this place. 
	“What about the money?” I asked Robert. He was dancing around on top of the suitcase in the wind. I watched him twirl around to look at me. 
	“The money,” he repeated, filling through his memories. “The money is here to make the house not disappear. I remember Esme mumbling something about giving you money because she needed you to take care of the home. Not to fix it but to care for it. So, she put all of her life savings in your name so you’d come. It was to instill some hope for you if I couldn’t do it.”
	I laughed. “Of course she did,” I shook my head. “I have more than hope now. I have faith in the home.”
	Robert smiled a little and shook his head in agreement. The trees and brushes where Gil once was started to rustle. I could hear heavy, deep footsteps slowly pick up their pace as if they were running through the woods, gaining speed. The footsteps and rustling came to an abrupt stop and the flapping of bird wings could be heard. I quickly looked up in the sky to see if I could spot Gil. There he was. Flying high above the trees and circling around in the sky, moving his head to scan the field of where Esme’s house was. Robert croaked, taking my attention away from Gil.
	“Let’s go home. I’m ready for some good shut eye myself,” he said, standing up and brushing himself off. 
	I stood up and lifted Robert in my hand. I opened the suitcase and in a flash of light I was back in Aurora’s closet. My home. My spirit is at rest.

I keep worrying about everything and can never really enjoy the moment, even when socializing. When I lived on my own, I would drink a little 2-3 nights a week, never got drunk just 1-2 drinks each time. I smoked weed every day. Never got intoxicated at work, never interfered with my life. Helped me be more socially well-adjusted and stable. This was after I had a bad heroin addiction a couple of years prior.

I had another bad bout with heroin about 3 years ago. Been sober now for 2 years. Moved in with my parents for support and it's been good, won't be on my own for at least another year so respecting my parents and staying 100% sober except for coffee.

Just wondering if anyone thinks there would be any issue with going back to occasionally drinking and smoking weed when I'm back on my own? I enjoyed it responsibly when I did. I also read about that question and an article came up on Anthony Bourdain, where he said that he had a heroin addiction when he was young, but then drank occasionally years later and never had an issue with it.

1hbk4jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hbk4jw/ro_city_of_mistrust/,[RO] City of Mistrust ,"Chapter 1: The Divide

In the bustling heart of Metropolis, two high schools stood only a few blocks apart: Crestwood Academy, a prestigious institution with manicured lawns and ivy-covered buildings, and Jackson Heights High, a neighborhood school battling with societal prejudices and stereotypes. Students at Crestwood wore designer clothes and spoke confidently of internships and Ivy League dreams. Meanwhile, Jackson Heights kids sported thrift store finds, drowning in unspoken narratives of struggle and resilience.

At Crestwood, Emilia was a star—a gifted artist whose murals decorated the hallways. She balanced sculptures and compositions with deadlines and drama, her light infectious. But behind her radiant smile was a world of pressure—her parents' expectations heavy on her shoulders. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of town, Jaxon was an underground poet, slinking into the shadows of city parks between skateboard tricks and coffee shop open mic nights. He expressed his pain through words, infusing every syllable with the struggles of freedom and authenticity.

Their worlds collided on a chance encounter at an art exhibit, a collective project uniting students from both schools. Emilia’s piece captivated the audience: a tragic mural depicting a lonely figure, surrounded by vivid echoes of dreams, hands reaching out but trapped behind a glass wall. Jaxon stood transfixed, the raw honesty striking a chord deep within him. Little did they know, behind their eyes lay a shared longing—for love, for belonging, and for understanding in a world that dictated otherwise.

Chapter 2: Love’s Rebellion

Their connection was instant—like a spark igniting kindling in a dark forest. They began to meet after school, sneaking to secluded cafes and rooftop gardens where the city became their canvas. Emilia taught Jaxon about color theory while he introduced her to the power of words, penning love letters adorned with poetry and passion. They spoke of dreams and fears, barriers and bridges, while moonlight wove silver threads through their insecurities and hopes.

Yet, whispers of their forbidden romance swirled like autumn leaves on the wind. Crestwood students taunted Emilia; Jackson Heights students warned Jaxon about the dangers of mixing worlds. Their friends worried but mostly questioned: “Why her? Why him?” The emotional walls each built around themselves began to crumble, only to be replaced with the razor-thin separation of loyalty and expectation.

Chapter 3: The Crumbling Facade

As winter descended upon Metropolis, the air thickened with looming tension. Their schools organized a charity gala to benefit struggling art programs. When Emilia suggested they attend together, Jaxon hesitated, his heart pounding with equal parts excitement and trepidation. ""We can't be seen together, Em. It'll crush everything we’ve built,"" he warned, voice low and fervent.

But love often races ahead of reason. The night of the gala, adorned like the stars they often gazed upon, they slipped into the soft glow of twinkling lights. For a moment, time suspended—a painting captured in eternity. But reality crashed down when Emilia’s boyfriend, Lucas—a Crestwood quarterback—spotted them. His friends surrounded him, fueled by ego and entitlement, while whispers of “traitor” echoed through the air.

The confrontation was brutal. Words turned to shoves; fists flew just as quickly. Jaxon fought back, but he could feel Emilia being pulled away, torn from his grasp as shame washed over him. Unbeknownst to Jaxon, Lucas had a reputation, and with a swift kick, the dance of love turned into a night of pain.

Chapter 4: The Collapse

Days turned into weeks. The weight of lost love and bruised hearts became unbearable. Jaxon claimed to be over Emilia, filling the void with slamming words and beer bottles, but the poetry that once flowed from his soul ceased to exist. Emilia, too, painted less, memories spilling onto her canvases in dismal hues. Each day was a dawn that whispered reminders of what could have been—a bittersweet echo.

Then, a sudden twist—Jaxon’s family received an unexpected notice. They would be moving out of the city, another casualty of gentrification swallowing up neighborhoods. He spent his last days in Metropolis torn between fulfilling family expectations and chasing after a fleeting dream of love. Panic rose within him; he needed to say goodbye.

Chapter 5: The Last Night

On a rainy evening, beneath a canopy of clouds, Emilia found herself at their secret rooftop. She could hear the distant hum of the city beneath her, an electronic heart beating with life and loss. Suddenly, Jaxon appeared—soaked, breathless, a whirlwind of desperation. “I couldn’t leave without… without knowing we tried,” he stammered.

Their fingers intertwined, held tightly like the fear of losing the other. Words poured forth—regrets, dreams, promises of change. They saw through the shattering walls of reality and into each other's hearts, rediscovering sparks long extinguished. With hearts racing, they shared one final kiss, a bittersweet reminder of all they had created and all they could never be.

As thunder rumbled in the distance, the storm unleashed its tears just like Emilia and Jaxon. The world around them faded, leaving behind only the memory of stolen moments and whispered vows. Time became irrelevant as they clung tightly, their souls searching for solace in a turbulent world.

Chapter 6: Eternal Separation

Days later, Jaxon left, a piece of his heart carried away in the wake of his footsteps. Emilia returned to school, her smile a facade; her art became dark and haunting, each stroke a reminder of love lost. She painted a mural—a tribute to Jaxon, filled with stormy blues, whispered promises, and the ache of longing. It stretched across the wall like an eternal sunset, an embodiment of their story.

Months later, on a quiet dusk, Emilia stood before the mural, tears mingling with the rain, and she whispered into the wind: “I will always remember.”

In that city of mistrust, two hearts once found each other amid the chaos, leaving behind echoes of love that would resonate forever—a testament to a love that burned bright but flickered too soon, entwined in fate’s inescapable script.

And so they became legends, their love a fleeting shadow painted against the backdrop of life’s relentless march, forever remembered through whispers and art.",1,1733886941.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

We are (were) long distance, he's American and I'm from South America, the whole year we were together we traveled back and forth between countries. Since I left him he wouldn't leave me alone, he flew to my country (8 hour flight) immediately the moment we broke up hoping to meet me and ""fix things"". Luckily my family was always protecting me and threatened him to call the police if he ever showed up at my house. I didn't leave home for a week. I was scared. 

He's sent me hundreds of emails (the only way he has my contact), and while I've ignored some of them, others I'm guilty of playing along. The first ten days of no contact were tough, but I did it anyway. Then I talked to him because I wanted him to remove me from his accounts that I had access to so I could stop seeing his activities, and from then on I accidentally left the door open again to occasionally talk to each other ""as friends,"" if a person can be friends with him…. Without realizing it, we started talking to each other every weekend again, all because I answered his emails and played along. Partly out of pity and because I'm too submissive and don't know how to stop people (one year with him was enough), and partly because I missed talking to him. In fact, one of those many times, I was the one who wrote to him first. 

One of those times we talked, I told him I was going to leave the chat because he was making me very uncomfortable, to which he started telling me that I was ""the worst."" Days later, I see on his Twitter a bunch of misogynistic tweets saying how worthless I am, that I am a whore and how no man will ever want me in their life. All because I didn't want to continue talking to him and because I retweeted a tweet that said something like women without men are better off, and in the end he proved it. Clearly he doesn't deserve any of my ""pity."" Still, later he wrote me more apologetic emails, justified himself by saying that he was drunk (he always is), and that I'm actually the best thing that could have happened to him. For some reason I spoke to him again despite that, I forgot about it. And it seems that I confused him enough that in a moment of impulse and obsession he bought a ticket to come to my country the next day, supposedly for some ""research work"", but also to invite me to have a coffee. To his invitation I said no, that it wouldn't be good for me to see him and that I wasn't interested in closing the chapter in person. And he continued begging me in other emails.

Today I went to my university to take a final exam and my friends sent me a message telling me that they had seen him hanging around the area, which made me so angry that I ended up telling him to meet me at a Starbucks at 10 am. And so it was. I saw him again after like three months, and two of breaking up. I told him that I couldn't be hearing from other people that he was stalking me, that this wasn't right, and that I had never said that I wanted to see him that he would take a plane to the other side of the continent like he did. And he was asking for forgiveness the whole time, for the pain he caused, for all the times he made me cry, for all the damage, and so on, saying that he just wanted to see me one last time and nothing more. I told him it was okay even though he didn't respect what I wanted and as always, I end up doing what he wants even when I'm not his partner. I guess I forgave him for the five hundredth time, but I made it clear to him that we're never going to be together again. He even asked me about having sex and I said no way. I'm not going to lose my dignity like that again. We ended up having a normal conversation laughing, as if nothing happened. What hurts me the most about abusive people is that they have that double personality, where he can be as sweet and nice as a violent abuser. I asked him not to drink anymore for his own good, and to not stop going to therapy or Alcoholics Anonymous. I also asked him for the last time not to write to me anywhere or try to create fake accounts to talk to me, and if possible not to come and bother my country. I promised him that I would not look for him again either so we can close the cycle once and for all. He ordered me an Uber and I left. And I hope that was really the last time I see him.

It felt weird but progressive at the same time, it's like I was there in front of him but I didn't feel love anymore. I didn't feel too uncomfortable either, except when he started wanting to kiss me and touch my body. I only let him hug me but he covered my hands with kisses. And even more uncomfortable was when he insisted on having sex ""one last time"" ""no one will find out."" It also frustrates me a lot that at a certain point when we talk I have so much fun because he's funny, and it makes me angry that he can't just be that nice part of him all the time, it makes me forget how dark he can be and how much he denigrated me when he was with me. He destroyed my self-esteem completely, and yet I laugh with him like it's nothing in a Starbucks. 

I never consider getting back together with him but I certainly miss talking to him, at least innocently, how am I going to resist the urge now? No one entertains me as much as he does among my friends. It feels so bad that I don't seem to care too much about his aggressions because in the end I always remember his good side and still want to talk to him, it's like I'm addicted to pain.

You all gave me so many good advices yesterday, that I decided to give an update on her condition today.

Today’s morning, her doctor called me to say she was well woke and also that she was better than the expected. He told me she was very sad about the paralysis, but, during the surgery, there is a voltage feedback he was measuring, which can drop to 50% and the patient will have good recovery, but, during her surgery, no drop in the voltage was seen, so, he expects a very good recovery.

I searched for some papers and found one from a guy in China who was using machine learning to predict the recovery for AN patients. I reproduced the algorithm, with ChatGPT’s help, and did run a python script with her data. The result was the better possible.

I went to the hospital to see her then, when I arrived, she was drinking a cup of coffee. She was very better today, answering me normally and doing her stuff. She could even eat during the evening and stood up from the bed to sit on a sofa nearby, of course, with help of the nurses. 

The o my thing keeping her on ICU still, is the blood pressure. Her BP was 170x120 after the surgery and they gave her meds to drop it. They are trying to remove the meds slowly but BP is still high. This is concerning me a little.

Ah, I also took an eye drop med to help with the paralyzed eye. Of course, recommended by the doctor. I am more confident now and looking forward to her exit of the ICU, so, I can go to the hospital to be on her side the entire time.

Thanks for all the support you gave me. It means a lot.

Before this trip, so far, almost all my buys have been some lucky blind buys (You or Someone Like You, Santal 33, Philosykos) or universally available staples (Jo Malone, Acqua di Gio, Chanel) or researching dupes just to give me some ideas. 

Ok, so we were in this huge high class mall and in theory it was paradise, the entire Penhaligons catalogue, the entire Diptyque, Amouage, Le Labo, Xerjoff, Orto Parisi. I tried dozens and dozens of testers, taking breaks and smelling coffee in between. NOTHING impressed me. Everything either smelled like something I smelled before or if it was interesting it was he kind of interesting that made me wonder if I really wanted to smell like that all day. I even found one of my modern grails, a bottle of YSL Les Vestiare's Rue de L'Universite, a fragrance with all the notes in theory I love!

couldn’t smell it, like at all. 

The only thing I kinda liked was The Noir 29 and honestly, just kinda. To me it smells like a fuller version of Philosykos, but not in an impressive way.

No, that’s a lie. Penhaligon's The inimitable William impressed me but it really wasn’t what I was looking for. Didn’t help that it literally was the first thing I tried so everything went downhill from there. 

Maybe because I was looking for something very specific (dark, manly, incense, nocturnal, vampiric, a little bitter and not sweet at all) and the brand representatives didn’t know what to do with that description?

But still, even if I didn’t found exactly what I wanted, in theory I tried enough samples to at least say “oh, nice”, but nope. I was unfazed. 

It’s laughable that the fragrance that have impressed me the most this past months is a cheap bottle of Encre Noire!

So I started dating a guy around 3 weeks ago. We have known each other around 1 year before that.
We usually only see each other once a week because he works very long hours. Means we only had two official dates (1 walk with coffee and 1 dinner date). 
Last weekend we had some sort of argument where he had told me he is sort of bummed because I text so little. Thats true, I usually only text him once or twice a week. Its not my tool of communication and I told him so at the beginning of our dating stage. I prefer calling or talking in person. 

Still he wants me to text him 2-3 things throughout the day. I asked him what he wants to know and he just said „anything that‘s on your mind“, „even a photo of your lunch is fine“. The thing that confuses me is, he almost never asks follow up questions or engages with my texts. He replies fast but his replies are usually „that‘s sweet“, „have fun“ or „how nice :)“. I told him his short replies seemed to me that he is not really interested in these texts but he was totally baffled when I said so. He also wants me to initiate.

It just seems a bit strange to me. I also feel like its too early to have this much communication? He also mentioned that he is bored at work. I don’t know if he just wants to be entertained. 
Am I totally overthinking this?

Never got intoxicated at work, never interfered with my life. Helped me be more socially well-adjusted and stable. This was after I had a bad heroin addiction a couple of years prior.

I had another bad bout with heroin about 3 years ago. Been sober now for 2 years. Moved in with my parents for support and it's been good, won't be on my own for at least another year so respecting my parents and staying 100% sober except for coffee.

Just wondering if anyone thinks there would be any issue with going back to occasionally drinking and smoking weed when I'm back on my own? I enjoyed it responsibly when I did.

Also english isnt my first language so sorry for mistakes. Any of you here got missdiagnosed by IC only to later find out it was something else?

Sympoms I have:
-some days there is pain after urinating but not during it
-some days there is pain or this unnamed feeling that is rather hard to pinpoint but I think its in my urethra and not in the bladder
-first time I had symptoms in 2020, they stopped completely in 2021 and I had no symptoms what so ever in three years, now late summer 2024 they came back
-sometimes symptoms last for couple of days, or a week but then they dissappear for days or weeks only to come back again. Like just now I had three weeks with super mild symptoms, barely noticable, but now couple days the pain has been pretty bad
-sometimes i feel like i need to push last drops of urine out

Symptoms that I see many of you have but I dont:
-pain during sexual activity
-frequent or painful urinating (pain comes only after peeing)
-i dont wake up at nights to pee
-i dont have to rush to pee
-i havent noticed that any foods worsen my symptoms, I drink alcohol, sometimes coffee, I eat really spicy food, too much candy etc


I also must say that when laying down, the pain gets milder and thats something Ive not seen anyone say.

In 2020 they cystocoped my bladder and found nothing out of the ordinary

Im also a male and I read that it is ten times more common in females. Thats why I have a suspicion that I might have been missdiagnosed and maybe I should visit more doctors. I got prescribed amitriptyline for the pain, havent yet started it

Any help would be greatly appreciated 🤗

They ran a restaurant business, and I helped them with designing banners and marketing the product. They set up shop beside another restaurant selling a different type of food. It turned out the other restaurant was using black magic, and our restaurant didn’t received much sales. We had to rely on online sales, and I was the one posting on pages to promote food delivery. But even that wasn’t enough. At some point, they gave up. We didn’t have any money left, and I had to quit my studies.

I was an excellent student, so quitting college was a heartbreaking decision. I started a small online business, but somewhere in the middle, my mom encouraged me to sit for an exam. I failed because I couldn’t focus. My head was everywhere. The situation at home was ugly. 

After the exam, I decided to stick to my business, but my sales dropped significantly, and my live viewers stopped showing up. Then the bank took my car.

Around that time, my mom started sending me job openings, telling me I needed to pay off the debt. What debt? It wasn’t even mine. Still, I worked a job I didn’t like just to earn money. Later, I found another job that paid more, but with it came more expenses. I was left with only 20% of my salary after deducting loan payments, some allowance for my parents, and rent for my own place.

One time, I decided not to give them the allowance. Partly because I was angry, and partly because I didn’t have much left for myself. just enough to treat myself to coffee to stay awake during work.. I hadn’t bought anything for myself since I started working. My mom responded by sending me posts about how “you don’t go broke by giving money to your parents,” indirectly accusing me of being stingy. And when I bought some good food for myself, my mom would tell me how I should be more frugal??

So yup, I gave them the allowance anyway.
Since then, I’ve felt myself change. When I go back to my parents’ house, it doesn’t feel like home anymore. I go because I feel obligated, but I don’t talk much. I feel sorry for them, but I can’t help but wonder do they feel sorry for me?

A few days ago, I lost my job. I haven’t told my mom because I know what will happen. She’ll send me more job ads, and it’ll make me feel miserable. The problem with her is that she doesn’t get support from my dad, so she puts all the burden on her daughters. It’s exhausting.

It’s already been 3 weeks since my last visit. I just have no heart of going back to my house, not even phone calls.",5,1733885309.0,confession,7,0.86,False

I come from arc, it was browser i settled in for a while after trying many browsers (including Firefox which i disliked for the lack of UI customization), arc worked OK i liked the UI but it still felt like corporate AI hell shoving AI down my throat... I went away mainly cause of that, it drove me nuts, but i still couldn't find a browser that matched Arc's UI... Until i randomly scrolling through reddit found a random post about UI customization in ZEN. I saved the post and the next day I was on zen, it feels great!

**\*What I like\***

I love the way the browser feels comfy, like a cup of hot coffee on a snowy December night, How it doesn't blind me every time i want to use it at the dark, how the UI choices just make sense, everything is where you expect it to be, it just feels good to interact with it. The Dev is cool (and hears our questions!) which is a big bonus for me coming from the big corporate generic New York startup that arc is. The community is helpful! And it is free of bloatware!

**~~\*What i don't like\*~~**

**\*SUGGESTIONS\***

* The new logo looks somewhat generic, something that reminds of the Z and still looks minimalist can be a good idea, i have seen great examples from the community;
* I feel that a mobile app for IOS is lacking, i use IOS myself and was somewhat disappointed to see that there isn't one available;

It’s just me sabotaging my self over and over again. I have been going to the gym on and off for almost six months now and what bugs me the most is that I always stop gouging of don’t feel like it when I get amazing results like, this summer I was going to the gym AND running at night as well, and let me them you something that must have been the best I have ever felt in years the scale was moving, I had more energy, I was pretty much happier and that’s when I started getting knee pain but I worked on that strengthening my joints at the gym so I don’t miss out on my runs, because I love the high that comes after the run and chasing that was basically why I was enjoyed that particular time. But I went to donate blood like I always do every month and I was told that my hemoglobin levels were too low. Meaning the amount of red blood cells that carries oxygen in my red blood cells was low meaning I didn’t have enough oxygen circulating in my body. Which shocked me because I didn’t fell like that at all. But then I tried to incorporate more red meat and other iron dense foods in my diet, which didn’t seem to be fruitful. But now 4 months later it seems I have fixed it. And now that I feel good I do everything in my power to avoid the gym like today, instead of hopping on the bus and going straight to the gym, I went to Timmy’s and got sour cream glazed donut with iced coffee. After getting bored of waiting I crossed the street and went to Winners. See what I mean I avoided going home early so I can’t go to the gym. What do you make of this?

I've thought for a while that I just had cord scarring or something, as my voice is usually a bit airy and inconsistent at some times. However, I found out a few months ago, by complete accident, that this was not actually the case. I was drinking a lot of this one canned coffee one night, and I found that my airways felt unnaturally clear. Like, to the point where it was *surreal*. I felt like I had opened my eyes for the first time; singing felt and sounded amazing (as I am somewhat familiar with tonal and breathing practices, but had never personally felt the affects until now). After a few days, however, my throat returned to it's normal state, and I am still chasing that high.  
I wondered how to achieve it once again, and was reassured (as I had already known) that drinking water assists in loosening mucus. So, I started drinking lots of water for about a week, but there were no noticeable changes in my voice. Because of this, I decided to try some otc decongestants and expectorants. Separately, nothing. Together, not really. I had no idea what to do, as I was so desperate to try and relive the experience.   
After a while, I just decided that I needed it no matter what. So basically, my ""genius"" plan was to non-stop drink water all day until I got the clarity back. I'm a bit on the bigger side, so I figured I'd be fine if I drank a lot of water. Long story short, I almost had to go to the hospital because I ended up drinking over a gallon and a half of water within too short of a period of time. Still, though, this did nothing. What can I do to fix this?

tl;dr I've tried lots of water, otc expectorants, decongestants, lemon, and various teas to try to get rid of throat mucus, but **nothing** has worked. How can I get rid of it?",1,1733884997.0,singing,1,1.0,False

I’ve blown most of my Christmas budget already, so trying to keep it under $60, so clones or dupes are OKAY at this point. From somewhere that can ship to me BEFORE Christmas.

He is 36. He works mostly outside. He is the “tall, dark and handsome” type, minus the tall. He is 5’10”. He is on the rugged side. Lots of tattoos, throws axes and has a glorious beard.

Specifically, the arguments laid out by Saagar today in his monologue are rehashed Anti-Saloon League talking points.

The Anti-Saloon League was an organization that strongly advocated the prohibition of alcohol. Their advocacy led to the 18th amendment. Imagine instead of Online Sports Gambling, Saagar said alcohol. It'd quickly reveal a silly argument about this vice.

To be specific, the anecdote that he shared about the man who lost a million dollars is swappable with any story about a man losing his money to alcoholism, prostitutes, etc. It's not a unique story when it comes to all things deemed vices.

Yes, there are negative consequences to vices. However, if these arguments Saagar made are compelling to you, think about why they might not be if he was talking about banning only fans or delivery services for alcohol & weed.

Saving the strongest point for last, that I agree is bad in persuasive writing, is that addiction is core to a lot of modern economies. Here is a list of markets that rely on addiction and design their services and products to increase addiction:

* The entire coffee industry
* Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, even Reddit all rely on user addiction to sell advertisements
* Video games use addicting game mechanics to get users to play more of the game. The games are designed to drive users to spend money on microtransactions
* Apps like Tinder, Bumble, etc. rely on ""whales"" (a small percentage of users driving most of the revenue) to keep their businesses running
* Netflix originally used to offer rewards for ways to enhance the clickthrough rate and watch time on the site
* There are specific food categories that are designed to be addictive and are detrimental to health if enjoyed in large quantities
* Amazon designed it's website to maximize shopping addiction through recommendations
* Credit Card were specifically designed to make users disassociate with their spending
* The biggest vice of all, which impacts remain unknown, is pornography.

I'll concede that these examples are not as pernicious as online sports gambling. And that Sports Gambling has a unique high compared to other activities. However, this will only be a small portion of the negative behaviors of a secular future. In my opinion, this will not be in the top 5 of negative vices in society.

I (male) lost my virginity at 19 to another male because it was easier than having sex with a female. 

Fast forward to me fucking up my relationship.

I met a very, very nice young lady who was a virgin, we dated for 7 months, and then finally had sex. 

During the 7 months I messaged others, and met up with an old ex and I wanted to have sex, knowing it was wrong but not wanting to stop, but the ex declined due to trying to be more grown up and not wanting to hook up.

After I had sex with my girlfriend for the first time, we shortly after moved in together and I figured I would get sex often to satisfy my urges, but it never came. She was simply too shy and anxious, although we were progressing.

However, I desired sex. I wanted raw sex. I wanted sex with men. 

I wanted sex with my girlfriend the most, truly, but the desires didn’t stop to find sex elsewhere. I continued to be on dating apps searching for sex with minimal success.

Until one one day I had sex with someone else whom I deemed desirable. Did the deed and went home. 

Days later I messaged an other ex and the ex threaten to expose me to my girlfriend.

I came clean to my girlfriend. Told her the whole truth, and she was devastated.

We took “a break” and during the break I had sex with someone else again. (I didn’t realize a break meant don’t have sex with someone else. I thought it meant we’re single people, talk to you soon.)

When I told her I had sex with someone else during the break, it broke her.

Then she had sex with someone else weeks later and that broke me for about 30 minutes. But then, I decided I still loved her and asked her can we try again?

She was asking me if I had attempted to solve my sex addiction in therapy, I stated no, or at least not much. I think that caused her to think I wasn’t taking it seriously (which is justified).

I was afraid to bring it up in the sessions because I didn’t want to solve it unless she came back. So it kind of never solved itself.

The try again never came, but we still spoke off and on until she met someone new a few weeks ago, and then contact began to cease.

I have accepted full responsibility for my actions and my problems as of today and I’m working to fix them!

### Training

I had run the Indy Mini-Marathon in late May, and set a PR of 1:18:49. After a post-season involving a 10 mile race, one of my friends bullied me into signing up for a marathon. Though I knew a world major wasn't in the books (I wanted to get the run done before 2025) I settled on CIM as the only place I could realistically race.

The summer involved two races- the Brooklyn mile which I ran in 5:03 and a Tracksmith Twilight 5k which I clocked a 17:27. Both races were PRs but weren't particularly important. Rather than treating them as peak races, I wanted to lock in on my mental game before racing.

Summertime mileage was pretty consistent but a solid grind up- even with two shorter races in the mix, I built from mid-50s to low 60s. As some added context, the peak of my previous HM block culminated in a 70 mile week, and I averaged somewhere in the mid-60s for the 10 weeks leading up to the race.

In August, I finish my internship and built up to some 70 mile weeks, September was a little lackluster but still consistent with the start of the school year, and then started stacking bricks. October and November saw (in order) 78, 81, 80, 71, 80, 72 mile weeks. The Strava graph was admittedly a bit erratic, but was still consistent. My longest runstreak was about 6 weeks long.

Training was great. Coach had me do one midweek workout and one weekend long run. The two major themes of this block (as I think with all good marathon blocks) were: Long long runs, long intervals. CIM is a 'cheater course' but is still brutally honest- I live and train in Chicago, so coach was sure to include hill strides (over the local highway overpass. Yippee. Always inspiring) into the mix.

I deviated from Coach's plans very little, but didn't take a day off every week and ran some occasional doubles. 

I don't want to share everything I did (the secret sauce entirely credited to Coach), but my staple weekday workout was a 1 hour/10 mile tempo. Throughout the 15 week marathon-specific block, I repeated this workout 6 times. Every time, I got progressively faster, working down from doing this at 6:40 pace (albeit over rolling hills at altitude) and finishing at a 10 mile tempo in 61:00 (done on a treadmill with varying incline from 0 -> 2). We also did a couple broken tempos with hills placed in the middle. 

I did a lot of long long runs. I did 4 3 hour runs, some with pace-specific work, a couple long run fartleks (say 9 x mile with 4 minute jogging recovery) nestled into 2h30min runs. My peak workout was 4 x 30 minutes on November 16th, averaging 6:25-20/mi for the intervals nestled into a run of 3h at a pace of 6:34/mi. That was very difficult, but it gave me lots of confidence for the marathon. I can share more details about overdistance runs in the comments if people are interested.

My coach has a wonderful philosophy, but the overdistance runs (i.e. 3 hour runs) were brutally difficult to recover from- both mentally and physically. I hadn't been someone who runs with music often, but those 3 hour runs almost always required some company (from friends on bikes) or other people to run with. Otherwise I was just too zoned out. However, the marathon is a brutally difficult task in and of itself.

I came dangerously close to running the full marathon distance in a couple runs, but I always made sure to stop early. Something about saving my marathon virginity for the day of the race was special. 

### Pre-race

Carb loading. I love Trader Joe's- some orange juice, some bread, some more bread. Not a big pasta guy (although a customary pasta dinner was had beforehand).

Traveled to Sacramento Saturday morning, landing sometime in the early afternoon. A quick trip to the grocery store to pick up dinner provisions, and we checked in to the airbnb around 3PM. Was an otherwise stress-less night. Was lucky to have two supporters, some family members, and a dear friend also running the race. Having a large support crew is great- something I never realized. People around really helped with calming me down (I get really bad prerace anxiety unless I'm talking to someone)

Morning wakeup was around 4AM, focused on drinking some cold brew coffee (for a total of 300mg of caffeine) and bagels/bread. Decided that I was going to try to eat solid food until ~5:45AM.

Got to the shuttle bus at 5:30, chilled out at the start line (with a light warmup- maybe 10 mins of jogging) in the meantime. Ate a Maurten 160 before heading over to the corral. 

### Race

I don't really have much recollection of the race. Coach suggested to go through halfway in around 1:25, and I decided not to listen to him. Sorry. I wanted to run under 2:45, and realized that a 4-5 minute negative split was far too aggressive. I was set on going through halfway in 1:23:mid and working down from there. I tried not to go faster than 6:20/mi for the first half.

I did listen to his other piece of advice, where he said that the marathon is a 20 mile tempo and 10k race. I decided that I would hold things steady for 16-18 miles, and then try to make a move if the legs allowed it. 

One of my friends quoted Stephen Scullion's 'Just another Sunday' mantra, which I kept in mind during the first half of the race. I knew I needed to be having some amount of fun i the first half, as that true 'race concentration' mentality can only be held for so long for me.

Jumped around the pack for the first 10 miles, working my way between a couple groups and getting free pacesetting from some incredibly locked-in NAIA atheltes. Wanted to run with some other people, but everyone was struggling enough with the up/downhills to where a consistent pack didn't really have the chance to form. Or maybe I just didn't get into one. I am glad that I chose to run with people, as their footstrike provided a nice rhythm to mimic.

My shoelace came untied around 3 miles in, and I only found a right moment to tie it around the 8 mile mark once I actually felt something in my toes. I'm grateful to all the people who passed me- although I'm not happy that they passed me- for letting me know my shoes were undone. Clocked off the first 5K in 19:37. This was a bit fast, but the downhills were absolutely carrying me.

Things went will past the 6 mile mark (clocked 5-10K in 19:41) and I went through mile 7, but falling behind the group I was loosely running with absolutely sucked due to tying my shoe. However, I took it as a goal to get back up to them, and althoguh I ran a slightly below-speed mile 9 (just out of the rhythm of things, as well as a slight uphill) I clocked in and was determined to catch up to this group before 11 miles, which I did do.

Immediately after catching up to this group (and clocking 6:11/18) for mile 10 and 11, my shoe came untied again. I tied it sometime in the 12th (6:34 mile) and caught back up to the group immedaitely after by using some hills and running tangents well to my advantage. I realized that there was no way I was holding 6:10/mi for miles 11 onward, so I dialed things down a bit in order to make sure I had the ability to close.  

I passed through halfway in **1:23:39**. At the 13 mile mark, I realized that I was feeling incredibly strong, and decided that I was going to keep things steady until 15. Restraint was difficult but necessary. Around this time, I caught two guys who were running together incredibly well, and used them for pacesetting. I believe they were either friends or enemies, and were participating in the NAIA championships attached to CIM. 

I ran miles 16 and 17 slightly faster- 6:17 and 6:16 just to see if my legs were up for the task of taking things quicker. This was the 'test' that I planned on. The answer was yes. Mile 19 was clocked off in 6:15, and I decided that it was the approximately correct time to make a move.

Around mile 20 I saw one of my family members who was spectating, and she yelled 'race starts at mile 20!.' Around this point, there was also someone who started dropping some quicker miles, and I was determined not to let him get away. I went into this race wanting to make sure that I negative split hard and raced well. I think this race was only well-executed because of my determination to not let this person pass me.

I closed mile 20 in 6:08, following this pace-pusher. At some point I joked if this was the '2:45 train' and he shrugged. The fact that I was able to but out a sentence at mile 19 was a surprise to me. 21 came in at 6:09, 22 in 6:12, 23 in 6:07, 24 in 6:09, 25 in 6:02, and 26 in 5:58. I don't have any memory of what happened after mile 20 (except for some dude in a Jesus costume damning me to hell over an overpass) and some poor segments of road. I felt my blood pressure rising significantly during this, which was pretty funny. Overall, I was really happy catching people who were fading, or making a move on others who tried to pass me. 

I had very slight cramps in my right calf from mile 23 onwards. Whenever a spasm hit, I would just scream out and run faster, changing my footstrike oh-so-slightly for 20 or so seconds.

I kicked to the end and clocked in a *2:44:41* for my first marathon.

### Post-Race

Had a nice cry because I felt overwhelmed. Not prideful but definitely proud of myself for putting in the work. Had my first beer of a couple months with dinner. 

Hindsight is 20/20 and retrospect is valuable, but I was definitely confused about some of the workouts. My coach was able to explain the purpose of each of them- I spent a lot of time reading about how other coaches develop systems (i.e. I read a lot about Canova's principles, some stuff about how Sa*azar did stuff, as well as looking scientific research and talking to experienced friends) and started to understand a lot more about what makes a fast marathoner tick. I also learned the value of recovery from workouts- one can half-ass recovering from 6 miles of threshold, but not from 30K close to marathon pace. 

I'm not ready to be self-coached, but I have a much deeper understanding of what it means to recover from workouts, adapt to stimulus, and understand what effort-specific workouts give you.

I'm really proud of my race execution. Especially for a first time, I think my approach was calm and level-headed. My negative split was well-executed.

I do also want to recommend Second City Track Club for anyone who lives in Chicago. The group is excellent, the coach is responsive and incredibly encouraging. Although he has his quirks, the system he's developed works well for someone already used to training at a 'serious' level, and relies on you (as someone who runs for fun, and for the love of the process) to make the most of it.

Although I gave coach a hard time for assigning these long long runs- nobdoy else I knew was running 22 miles + on a consistent basis- I'm confident that these were critical to my ability to close the marathon hard. Not only was I physically prepared to run fast on pre-cramping legs, but I was psychologically zoned in to running for over 2.5 hours (which I hadn't really done beforehand). What I could not make up for in volume (i.e. running 100mpw, or consistently running 80+) was made up for in stimulus from the overdistance runs. I do not recommend them for everyone, but when done intermittently and properly (i.e. with every care of nutrition and recovery before/after) they aren't too bad.

CIM's weather profile also fit me. I do well in the cold (or at least I think weather impacts me more than it does most people). The slight mist, cold temperatures, and lack of wind were absolutely wonderful.

Legs were fully shot. Taking a week of no running.
