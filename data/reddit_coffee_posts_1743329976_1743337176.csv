Went to Florida this weekend and was asked to tip in a candy store where I walk around, pick everything out myself, and bag it. The machine was showing tip options and the minimum was 18%!! My gf ended up paying for this and I couldn’t be more proud when she put 0 as the amount. 

At the hotel I walked into the hotel shop to grab a water and snack, also picked everything myself and they ask for a tip. The coffee shop at the hotel also asked for tip but they make the coffee so that I can understand, but 18% min? Am I crazy or is all of this out of control? I understand tipping when you’re getting some sort of service but to tip when they don’t anything for you is a bit much. ",1,1743337050.0,tipping,0,1.0,False

I’m 33, 5’3”, and living somewhere near Bali with my spoiled dog. I’m a Chinese-Indonesian, and lived in Australia and South Korea before (still visit often).

I’m a homebody at heart—give me my dog, a good book, and a strong cup of coffee, and I’m content. (Which might explain my single status, oops.) That said, the right company can definitely tempt me outdoors! I love traveling, going to concerts, enjoying beach days, and soaking in nature, as long as insects respect my personal space.

I’ve never been married, don’t have kids, and don’t want kids either. Looking for something monogamous with an emotionally available man, so if you’re married, separated or in a relationship, this isn’t for you.

If you love dogs, have a great sense of humor, and can appreciate a little sarcasm, we’ll probably get along. And if we really hit it off? I’m open to meeting up, traveling, or even relocating. Actually, please give me an excuse to relocate 😂

If you’re serious about getting to know each other, tell me about yourself. “Hey” and “what’s up” tend to get lost in the void.

1jnb40t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1jnb40t/kendu_the_diamond_opportunity_is_here/,Kendu - The Diamond Opportunity is Here,"**A Quick Introduction**   
  
Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  
Kendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns. Furthermore, this method is tried and tested, all we need to do is push Kendu along that same path.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu has great distribution too, which is getting better all the time, our holders seem to grow daily even in the terrible market.  
Kendu has lots of IRL products which bridge DEFI to the real world, this is very attractive to retail investors, as IRL products show authenticity.  
Kendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.  
What makes me insanely bullish is the fact that even when many people could have lost a lot of money in the markets downturn, Kendu still pumps out IRL products. Imagine what will happen when Kendu is in the billions :0

  
**IRL Products and Events**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global

**Miami Music Week**

Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  
Kendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event.   
NoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.

  
**Kendu Creator**

Kendu Creator is a website created by a chad called Akabe, where you can 3d print a Kendu mask. Whilst wearing this mask, you can play drums(like Akabe), lift weights, dance, sing.... the list goes on. This is a project to get Kendu on all forms and areas of social media, this is gonna be great, soon people will be seeing drums, people singing and running all wearing a Kendu mask. This is truly a revolutionary idea and it could make Kendu viral. We also have the Akabe mask as a filter on TikTok, so you can create a TikTok video without actually printing the mask. This gives access to the Akabe mask to everyone.  
Akabe has mentioned the discipline that Kendu creator has brought to his life, Kendu creator has gave him a lot of discipline to practice to drums daily to improve the content he can make. Akabe says Kendu creator gives people purpose and it pushes people to become a better version of themselves whilst pushing Kendu to the top. This is wonderful and it shows the Ken-Du mentality.

I cannot stress this enough, this is one of the best ideas that has came out of Kendu so far!!!

**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**

A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days(with far less money in the market), so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need, so what are you waiting for?  
Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  
Skip the Dominos Cheese Pizza and put the $15 into Kendu, where imo you could make $15000. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  
All the signs were there...

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

Always remember, to never bet against a community

1jnb3uk,https://i.redd.it/w4k891pdjtre1.jpeg,Some people think that prayer is a waste of time.,"Let me give you my opinion. Regardless of the spiritual, psychological and mental benefits of prayer, it has many worldly benefits too (imo at least) 

Waking up early for Fajr benefited me greatly personally. After Fajr, you get at least 3 hours of distraction free time. You can focus from 5 AM to 8 AM much much more than you can focus from 5 PM to 8 PM.

From Fajr to Dhuhr, I already have something like 8 hours to do various tasks, so generally I would have finished my work early and have the rest of the day to do other things.

Prayer organizes your day and splits it into chunks. You never get bored because it was a ""looong"" day. And also you can't waste your time doing something for like 6 hours straight.

You go to sleep early because you must get up early. I coupled this with quitting coffee (because I was irresponsible and used to drink coffee in the evening). It improved my sleep and fixed my insomnia.

Ablution is also obviously beneficial and even the physical act of prayer itself is too. 

So I think that prayer is great from every aspect you can think of. And I encourage those who are religious but not practicing yet to just start praying regularly the way it was prescribed to us.

I'm amazed at how creative people have gotten in 2025!

The ""AR overlay"" pranks are taking over this year. There's a fantastic compilation of people using augmented reality to make it appear as if something absurd is happening in real time. My favorite is the office worker who made it look like their boss's car was being towed during a meeting. Watching the boss sprint out of the conference room mid-presentation only to find his car perfectly safe is comedic perfection. The look of confusion followed by the slow realization that it's April Fools Day is priceless.

The ""grocery store confusion"" GIFs are subtle but brilliant. People subtly adding random items to strangers' shopping carts when they're not looking. The woman who didn't notice until checkout that her cart somehow contained six pineapples, a plunger, and a romance novel had the most perfect double-take. Even better was the cashier's completely straight face as they rang everything up.

I'm particularly impressed with the ""hot sauce coffee"" series. The buildup is what makes these so good – someone painstakingly empties a creamer container, fills it with hot sauce that matches the color, and then offers it to their coworker the next morning. The delayed reaction as the spice hits is magnificent. One guy actually spit his coffee all over his keyboard and then tried to play it cool like nothing happened!

The ""fake celebrity"" pranks have reached new heights this year. Getting friends or family to believe a celebrity is randomly in their neighborhood is classic, but the execution in 2025 is next level. There's an amazing GIF of a mom who was convinced that her daughter's favorite singer was doing a surprise concert at their local park. The daughter's journey from excitement to suspicion to realization is documented in perfect GIF form.

My absolute favorite has to be the ""drone delivery mishap"" series. People are setting up fake delivery drones to drop absurd packages on doorsteps – everything from giant stuffed animals to confetti bombs. The guy who received what appeared to be a government-classified package (complete with fake warning labels) had the most amazing reaction – a combination of fear, confusion, and morbid curiosity that spoke to the human condition.

These are perfect for pranking your friends, family, or coworkers!

I've been collecting these for months, and I'm particularly proud of this year's batch. There's something oddly satisfying about watching someone fall for a perfectly executed prank, especially when no one gets hurt (at least not physically – pride is another story!).

First up is this absolute classic – the ""meeting room chair drop."" Some genius IT guy set up all the conference room chairs to drop about two inches when someone sits down. The synchronized reaction of everyone in the 9 AM marketing meeting is PRICELESS. Their coffee goes everywhere! The best part is how the one guy who's late walks in all confused why everyone is standing up dabbing coffee off their shirts.

Then there's the ""elevator floor"" prank where they replaced the elevator floor panel with a screen showing the shaft below. The reactions range from people plastering themselves against the wall to one brave soul who started jumping up and down on it! The elderly woman who just rolled her eyes and said ""I've lived too long to fall for this nonsense"" is my spirit animal.

The ""haunted bathroom mirror"" GIF is next-level. Someone rigged the bathroom mirror to show a ghostly face when the temperature of the room changes (basically when someone showers). The guy who punched the mirror out of instinct probably regretted that decision immediately.

I'm also dying at the ""drone spider"" compilation. People running from what they think is a massive spider, only to realize it's a tiny drone with fuzzy legs attached. The guy who threw his laptop as a defensive measure and then had that moment of realization... I've watched it at least fifty times.

My absolute favorite though has to be the ""smart fridge rebellion"" where someone programmed their coworker's smart fridge to play the X-Files theme and flash its lights whenever they opened it. The progression of emotions from confusion to understanding to planning revenge is written all over their face.

\- L-threonate magnesium, 1600mg

I mean I could never sleep after 2 coffees and a preworkout or drinking them late, my sleep would be compromised. Now i felt so sleepy and physically tired, lethargic,and I struggled to push even thru a short workout.  I know the energy is mpving thru you, and clearing up old energies and such. But i didnt find a lot of Content online on what are the symptoms  after you start, i felt a bit energetic here and there in short outbursts. Its interesting because I eat well, drink a lot of water ( also a looootttt of dehydration happened, to the point of constipation and cramps even after taking pills for that, putting salt in water, electrolytes etc) . 
Now things are a bit better. Chat gpt gave me the most info on this, Saying its all normal,
Takes from 4-7 days to start feeling better again. Maybe i did too many too intense. I was thinking “so what if they are for advanced? Its meditation how intense can it be?” 
I guess I found out. But I want to hear of people experienced these also? Or what was the experience?
On a very positive note, the most changes i saw was in my body’s response to some situations. And I started keeping track of them
Like for example, if i would have a problem with the food I ordered i would never send it back or say anything. It would create anxiety and discomfort. And few days ago I had to do it. And nothing. The body doesn’t recognize that emotion anymore. And this is common now for a lot of uncomfortable conversations , which by thinking about them I used to feel anxious.
Now again,  nothing, no emotional response. And I practiced the water rising one, and i made the habit of using the word Change everytime the brain tries to make up some stupid story or whatever scenario .

Taste: Too bitter. Especially at the end of the cup. Lingering bitterness on the tounge. 

* I FEEL LIKE No matter what I do I feel like I get a bitter cup. 
* No matter what I do I get a watery puck after the brew.

**What I have already tried:** 

* Grinding corser to lower the extraction - didn’t feel a difference
* Shorten the shot - instead of 36g out; 32g out. - didn’t feel a difference
* I changed beans; robusta/arabica mix in various proportions - still wasn’t satisfied. 
* As often this community recommends I **ground finer;** to the point I couldn’t get a steady flow anymore (clogged) 

I must be doing something dead wrong if I get similar outcomes with different beans.  Should I tamp stronger? Should I grind finer? (the flow seems too fast and I see channeling)

I'll be in Siena for a while and I’m looking for a good café or coworking-friendly spot where I can work remotely for a few hours a day. Ideally somewhere with:

- Power outlets

- A chill vibe (not too noisy or crowded)

- Friendly to laptops and people who stay for a while


I don't mind ordering coffee and snacks regularly, of course – just want to find a comfortable place where I won’t feel out of place working on my laptop.
Any recommendations from locals or fellow remote workers?

I'm 41m and recently got a girlfriend and have unfortunately subjected her to my world which is apparently very gassy. I can fart about 2-6 times *per hour* throughout the day, and these aren't small puffs, but quite thunderous. She's got a good sense of humour about it, and I tend to be able to insert them with some great comedic timing, but the question has presented itself - is it healthy to have this much gas? 

For reference, we cook a lot at home and eat pretty balanced meals, vegetarian a few times a week. I also recently started to drink AG1 every morning, but tbh this has been going on for years before I started that. I'm in decent physical condition, I work a physical job every day and also play hockey twice a week, and drink about 2 litres of water daily, with 1-2 coffee's throughout, hardly ever drink soda or sugary stuff. I'd say my diet is fairly healthy compared to most people.

➤➤➤➤  **CHAPTER SUMMARIES**  ➤➤➤➤

**CHAPTER 49 - HAVELOCK**

Floating outside the Roci, Havelock tries to talk down the RCE militia, but they are set on capturing him and Naomi under Murtry’s orders. Makeshift missiles fly, and Havelock shoots some down, but one detonates close, sending him tumbling into space.

Basia bravely leaves the ship to drag Havelock back from his impromptu space ballet while the Barb takes hits. The Barb is knocked into a slow tumble, and Alex cannot detach the tether. Basia refuses to cut it, determined to fix the damage. Meanwhile, Havelock sets up as a sniper, realizing that his biggest fear is not dying but pulling the trigger on another human being.

**CHAPTER 50 - ELVI**

Elvi, Amos, and Fayez trudge across New Terra’s wrecked landscape in a rough little cart, taking in the post-storm alien wasteland. They find Murtry and Wei’s abandoned cart, which is not a good sign. They finally reach the eerie, glowing alien structure where Holden’s last distress signal came from, and Elvi immediately clocks it as a bad place to be. The air is acrid, the architecture is actively threatening, and then, of course, Wei shows up to block their path. Amos tries to reason with her, but she is still playing for Team Corporate Overlords.

Then Murtry, because he is a manifestation of every inconvenience known to humanity, ambushes Amos and *shoots* him *multiple times* (I am about to leap into this book and handle this personally!). Amos and Wei fire at each other, and just like that, Wei is dead. Fayez, who has zero brawling credentials, tackles Murtry in pure rage, telling Elvi to run. Elvi bolts inside the structure to find Holden as gunfire echoes behind her.

**CHAPTER 51 - BASIA**

Basia has precisely one priority: saving Felcia and the other Barb refugees from burning up in the atmosphere. The Roci and the Barb are still tethered together in a deadly space waltz, while RCE militia members, somehow still listening to Murtry’s nonsense, attack. Havelock fights back, still trying to talk them down.

Naomi and Basia come up with a plan to turn emergency airlocks into makeshift escape pods. Felcia and the others make it out, and Basia, watching her escape, has a gut-punch realization: every single person he has saved is someone’s family, just like Katoa had been his. The grief he has been carrying finally spills over, but Naomi pulls him back, reminding him that this time, he saved lives. As the Barb burns up, Havelock acknowledges Basia’s bravery, but they only have four days of relative safety.

**CHAPTER 52 - ELVI**

Exhausted but determined, Elvi uses signal delays to triangulate Holden’s location. She climbs the alien structure and crosses a disturbingly reactive bridge before finding Holden, and Miller, now a protomolecule construct. Holden refuses to believe Amos is dead, and so do I. Elvi warns Holden that Murtry is coming, intent on stopping them from shutting down the alien systems. Holden decides she will work with Miller while he deals with Murtry. As they descend into an ancient control room, Elvi sees an uncanny thing in the center of the room, something Miller cannot see, like the eye of an angry god.

**CHAPTER 53 - HOLDEN**

Holden and Murtry face off on a narrow bridge above a deep chasm. Murtry insists that conquering a new world requires blood and sacrifice, while Holden counters with his usual exasperation at corporate sociopathy. When Murtry hints that Amos might still be alive, Holden’s resolve sharpens, it is personal now. The inevitable shootout begins. Holden shoots Murtry in the chest, arm, and leg, sending his gun into the abyss. Rather than letting gravity finish the job, Holden hauls him up, planning to expose Murtry’s crimes and make sure he is buried in legal hell. Murtry scoffs, but Holden reminds him that the most powerful person on Earth owes him a favor. Before Murtry can retort, the factory erupts into chaos as ancient alien machines roar to life.

**CHAPTER 54 - ELVI**

Miller has a plan to get as close as possible to the mysterious dark void and shut down the system that is killing everything, but his plan means sacrificing himself. Again. Elvi helps him get into position, and all hell breaks loose. Hostile machines attack, overwhelming Miller in a brutal battle. Elvi fights back, using whatever she can, but the real advantage is the dead zone itself. Machines collapse when they touch it, and she lures attackers to their doom.

Miller, critically damaged, asks for one last favor: retrieve a blue, almond-shaped core from his wrecked body and carry it into the void. The thing is absurdly heavy, but Elvi, despite exhaustion and the approaching swarm, pushes forward. As she steps into the darkness, reality unravels. She experiences herself dissolving, every cell, every molecule, becoming part of something vast and unknowable. When she comes to, the alien machines have gone silent. Holden’s voice crackles through, asking if they won. Still shaken, Elvi confirms, “Yes. We won.”

**CHAPTER 55 - HAVELOCK**

Havelock watches as First Landing begins to rebuild, coordinating supply distribution with Lucia. He recalls nearly dying when the reactor failed, but Alex restarted it just in time. Amos survived but lost fingers. With power restored, the Roci and Israel navigate political tensions, since the Belters on the Israel are now refugees or settlers. Scientists also choose sides. Ship repairs progress, and Havelock faces a wrongful death lawsuit for killing Williams. He receives a message from Captain Murray showing news coverage of the Barb’s evacuation, portraying him as a hero.

**CHAPTER 56 - HOLDEN**

The Roci is battered but still flying, thanks to Alex’s skill. As First Landing rebuilds, Holden shoos off settlers from camping too close to the ship before heading to town, where Carol and RCE are bickering over generators. Amos, looking like a cyborg pirate, handles his injuries well, while Fayez limps, dragging it out just enough to keep Elvi close to him. After heartfelt goodbyes, Holden spares Basia from prison and demands decent coffee when he returns.

Back on the Roci, liftoff feels like a warm embrace, but the real moment of joy is *fresh coffee.* Holden, delighted, brews for the whole crew. However, he has unfinished business. Alone, he searches the cargo bay and finds the last remnant of the protomolecule - a tiny polyp clinging to a conduit. Sealing it in a probe, he launches it toward Ilus’ sun. Watching it drift, Holden gives a final goodbye to Miller, acknowledging that the detective had saved another world with no reward.

Holden visits Murtry, informing him that he will face trial on Luna. Amos joins, ominously reminding Murtry that he made him kill Wei. Holden leaves before hearing more, uneasy about what Amos might do, but knowing that Murtry deserves to be afraid.

**EPILOGUE - AVASARALA**

On Mars, Avasarala navigates diplomatic meetings, first with Speaker Pratkanis, who seems either oblivious or unwilling to acknowledge the gravity of the situation. Later, she meets with Fred Johnson, discussing the Belt’s fragile stability and Anderson Dawes’ role in holding it together.

Avasarala steps off the tube, exhausted, but none of that matters because she is meeting with BOBBIE!! Over dinner, she vents about how Holden, *of all people,* actually *stabilized* the Ilus disaster instead of making it worse. But the bigger problem is that Mars’ future is crumbling. The opening of the Ring Gates means people are abandoning the planet, and worse, its powerful, disciplined military might start *selling its fleet to the highest bidder.* Bobbie put the pieces together. This was not dinner, it was a recruitment. Avasarala made it clear, “I need to put you back on the board, soldier.” Oh, it is *on!* Next book, now!",3,1743335235.0,bookclub,18,1.0,False

# Best Laptop Keyboard Covers 2025: Style & Protection

Laptop keyboard covers have become an indispensable accessory for laptop users, acting as a protective barrier against spills, dust, crumbs, and wear. In 2025, with remote work continuing to be prevalent and the lifespan of laptops being extended, ensuring your keyboard remains clean and functional is more crucial than ever. This article will explore the best laptop keyboard covers available, focusing on models that offer both robust protection and enhanced style. We'll delve into key features, benefits, and comparisons to help you make an informed decision, keeping your device's keyboard safe and stylish.

[[Explore Top Rated laptop keyboard cover on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/tablet-accessories/?kw=laptop keyboard cover)

## Key Features Analysis

The modern laptop keyboard cover is defined by several core features that directly impact its protective and ergonomic qualities.The best covers seamlessly integrate into your workflow, offering a near-invisible layer of protection without hindering typing speed or comfort.

**material Quality and Durability**

The material used in a keyboard cover is paramount to its lifespan and effectiveness. Premium covers are made from high-grade thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) or silicone. tpu offers superior clarity and durability, resisting stretching and tearing better than lower-quality alternatives. Silicone provides a softer touch and is frequently enough more form-fitting, but might potentially be less resilient over prolonged use. Look for covers with a thickness between 0.1mm and 0.3mm – this strikes a balance between protection and typing sensitivity.

**Precision Fit and Keyboard Compatibility**

A perfectly fitting keyboard cover is essential for preventing contaminants from reaching the keys and for ensuring a comfortable typing experience. Manufacturers typically design specific covers for various laptop models and keyboard layouts to ensure a snug and accurate fit. Before purchasing, verify compatibility with your laptop's exact make and model number. Considerations include the size and shape of the keys, the presence and location of the power button, trackpad, and other surrounding components.

**Transparency and Visibility**

High-quality keyboard covers should maintain excellent transparency, allowing the keyboard's backlight to shine through clearly. This is particularly critically important for users who frequently work in low-light environments. Avoid covers with excessive tinting or opacity, as they can strain the eyes and reduce typing accuracy. The best options boast close to 99% transparency, ensuring minimal visual interference.

**Typing comfort and Tactile Feedback**

The impact of a keyboard cover on typing comfort and tactile feedback is a primary concern for many users.Thinner covers generally offer a more natural typing sensation, while thicker options may slightly dampen key presses. Look for covers with a smooth, non-slip surface to enhance grip and prevent accidental keystrokes. Some manufacturers also incorporate a subtle texture or contouring to improve tactile feedback and reduce finger fatigue during extended typing sessions.

Key features of high-performing laptop keyboard covers include:

* Premium Tpu or Silicone Construction
* Model-Specific Precision Fit
* High transparency for Backlight Visibility
* Comfortable Typing Experience

## core Benefits

Investing in a quality laptop keyboard cover offers a multitude of practical benefits, extending the lifespan of your device and enhancing your overall user experience. From simple protection to more advanced hygienic properties, the right cover can make a meaningful difference in your daily workflow.

**Enhanced Protection Against Spills and Dust**

The most immediate benefit of a keyboard cover is its ability to shield your laptop from spills and dust. A single splash of coffee or errant crumb can potentially render your keyboard unusable.A well-designed cover acts as a waterproof barrier, effectively preventing liquids from seeping into the delicate internal components.this is particularly important for users who frequently work in cafes, on public transport, or in environments where food and beverages are present. Similarly, by trapping dust and debris, it protects against the build-up of grime between keys, which can lead to sticky or unresponsive keystrokes.

**Prevention of Key Wear and Fading**

Over time, constant use can cause the letters and symbols on your keyboard to fade or wear away. This can not only make typing arduous but also detract from the overall aesthetic of your laptop. A keyboard cover acts as a protective layer, absorbing the wear and tear of daily use and preserving the original appearance of your keys. this is especially beneficial for users who rely heavily on specific keyboard shortcuts or functions, ensuring that the key markings remain visible and legible for longer.

**Improved Hygiene and Cleanliness**

Laptops are veritable breeding grounds for bacteria, accumulating germs from fingers, desks, and other surfaces. A keyboard cover provides a smooth, non-porous surface that is easy to wipe down and disinfect, helping to maintain a higher level of hygiene. This is particularly relevant for shared laptops or those used in environments where cleanliness is paramount. Some covers also incorporate antimicrobial properties, further inhibiting the growth of bacteria and promoting a healthier user experience.

**Preserved Resale Value**

By protecting your keyboard from damage, wear, and contaminants, a laptop cover can help maintain its resale value.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions directly ensures clarity and builds confidence in a product. Here are some answers to typical queries regarding laptop keyboard covers.

**will a keyboard cover affect my laptop's cooling?**

In most cases, a thin and well-designed keyboard cover will not significantly affect a laptop's cooling performance. Modern laptops are designed with sophisticated cooling systems that primarily draw air from vents on the sides or bottom of the device, not directly through the keyboard. However, very thick or poorly fitted covers could potentially trap heat and slightly reduce airflow. Opting for a thinner and more breathable Tpu cover can minimize any potential impact on cooling.

**How do I clean a laptop keyboard cover?**

Cleaning a laptop keyboard cover is a simple process. First, remove the cover from your laptop. Then, gently wash it with mild soap and warm water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the material. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry completely before placing it back on your laptop. Regular cleaning, ideally every one to two weeks, will help maintain hygiene and prevent the buildup of dust and grime.

**Are keyboard covers reusable?**

Yes, high-quality keyboard covers made from Tpu or silicone are designed to be reusable and long-lasting.With proper care and cleaning, they can provide years of protection for your laptop keyboard. Avoid excessive stretching or folding, as this can weaken the material over time. If the cover becomes damaged or excessively worn, it should be replaced to ensure continued protection and hygiene.

I am not capable of expressing my feelings too well through words, but I hope you felt them in every touch. Stroking your hair, your cheeks, holding your hands, the little looks I'd steal your way when you weren't looking, making coffee for you, that was my love language. I felt safe and calm whenever I lied on you and listened to your heartbeat. You told me you loved me but you were not sure if I was the girl you would settle down with.

And I told you I loved you and I envisioned myself building a family with you someday. You didn't know yet I knew, and it was my cue to bid adieu. I never wanted diamond rings, money or any material from you. All I ever wanted was your time, love and affection. I can't express the joy I would feel whenever I saw you in person or whenever my phone rang with your name flashing on the screen.

I love you but I love myself more and I deserve to be loved mutually, so I am choosing myself, A.

1jnaf40,https://www.reddit.com/r/lazerpig/comments/1jnaf40/how_to_salt_trump_imperalism_plans/,How to salt Trump Imperalism plans,"Folks, let’s talk about the big news of the day: Donald Trump’s brilliant threat to annex Greenland and Canada. Yes, because nothing screams 'stable genius' like declaring war on maple syrup and icebergs. This is the geopolitical equivalent of a raccoon trying to steal the moon—ambitious, adorable, and completely insane.

But don’t worry, because our friends in Canada and Greenland have come up with an absolutely fantastic idea to counteract Trump’s plan. Are you ready for this? They’re handing out millions of passports—just flinging them out like Oprah giving away false smiles: ‘You get a passport! You get a passport! Everyone gets a passport!’ And who are they giving them to? Europeans, liberals, Bernie Sanders fans, Greta Thunberg’s Twitter followers, that guy in Norway who knits sweaters for chickens—basically, anyone who thinks universal healthcare is a good thing and that climate change is real.

Why are they doing this? It’s genius. If Trump succeeds in annexing Greenland and Canada, he doesn’t just get a bunch of frozen tundra and polite people who apologize when you bump into them. No, no, no—he also inherits 600 million ultra-liberal citizens who will immediately vote him out of office faster than you can say ‘covfefe.’ It’s like buying a new Trump Tower, only to discover it’s full of Bernie Sanders supporters in every room, knitting pink hats with 'Make Love not War' buttons all over it

And folks, the election results in this new America will be glorious. The Republicans and Democrats will be sidelined so hard, they’ll look like third-party candidates. Instead, the newly formed 'American Socialdemocratic Party'—or as Trump will probably call it, 'The Radical Left Socialist Woke Mob Party of Doom'—will sweep every election at 70% and counting. Their new agenda? Free healthcare, free college, and free maple syrup for all. And guess what? Bernie Sanders will finally be president! Can you imagine Bernie taking the oath of office? 'I do solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth—because billionaires hate the truth!'

And folks, it doesn’t stop there. Once the liberals take over, they’re going to make some big changes. First, they’ll make German the official language of law—because if there’s one thing Americans love, it’s umlauts and compound words that are 50 and more letters long. Next, French will be the mandatory second language at school, so people can finally use dirty words to but make them sound sweet.

Finally, they’ll vote to enforce mandatory gendering in every sentence. Forget ‘he’ or ‘she’—from now on, it’s gonna be ‘he/she/they/ze/xir/whatever-you-want’ for everyone. And if you don’t comply? Boom—two years in woke jail. Which, let’s be honest, is just a coffee shop in Portland.

Oh, and the fake news crackdown? It’s going to be intense. Fox News? Gone for Folksverhezzung. Twitter trolls? Banned from the Internet for Life. Your uncle on Facebook who posts memes about Hillary Clinton eating babies? Sent to a re-education camp where he’ll be forced to binge-watch TED Talks on intersectionality. And don’t even get me started on the crackdown on hate speech. The only thing you’ll be allowed to hate in this new America is pineapple on pizza—and even that’s a little iffy.

So, there you have it, folks. Trump thinks he’s playing 4D chess, but it turns out he’s just playing Poker with Monopoly cards. Because if he annexes Greenland and Canada, he doesn’t get new territory—he gets a brand-new liberal utopia where Bernie Sanders is president, AOC is vice president, and every American citizen gets a free kombucha starter kit.

So, Mr. Trump, if you’re watching—and let’s be honest, you probably are—please, by all means, go ahead and annex Greenland and Canada. I dare you. Because when you do, the people of this new America are going to make sure you’re not president of it for long. And then you learm what it feels like to be… fired.

Anxiety isn't some magic or things that most people talk and say it is. It's very simple - it's a combination of 2 things:

**1. The mind is designed to predict potential danger and threat to help us survive.** What most people don't see however, is that while we have the obvious, outside experiences - like rejection or a tiger on the loose... we also have internal painful experiences we once felt - internal experiences. Our minds can't tell the difference between emotional and physical danger... so when you have to do public speaking for example, it already knows... before you even go... that there's a potential of you re-experiencing your *old experiences... judgement... potential humiliation... appearing not good enough etc.*

This is not who you are... or some disease. This is the meaning you assigned when you were like 4-7 years old. And our brains don't know time... so they keep running those old programs and habits - until we change them directly *(and sadly therapy still fails to do that...)*

This is the only reason why one person stands in a club, wants to approach someone, and feels anxiety straight away, before even moving a muscle... getting thoughts like *'what if he/she doesn't like me?' or 'I'm not drunk enough'*.... trying to find a safe way, not to get rejected or emotionally hurt. Even if rationally situation is obviously not threatening... While another person, does not feel rejection to be that bad. So he/she doesn't get anxiety triggered... thoughts arise more positive *'I wonder where she's from?' 'I should go over'* and it just feels new.. uncertain... still adrenaline flows the body, but without like a *potential threat.*

But for the other person, literally it feels like as if you knew there's a shark in the water, you fear it, and you're afraid to go anywhere close to the water. But in that situation, there's no shark *- it feels like an invisible barrier.*

**2. The body is influenced by our health and sensitivity.** If we lack hormonal health and energy... and our balance shifts into sensitive biology - from hormone injected foods, unhealthy diet, late-night sleep, coffee/sugar, alcohol etc. Then our body KNOWS automatically... we are more ***vulnerable.*** This makes ALL anxieties... negative thoughts, worries, fears - Worse. We also experience them, stronger.

And when people have no good hormones, and only weak hormones - people get thrown into ***fear.*** Uncertainty. Unknown. *=* ***A panic attack.***

This is easy stuff in medicine. Yet nobody addresses the root cause, the old programming and the health. And instead keeps people convinced that you have a this disease label and you have to cope/live with. It's a bunch of garbage. I myself came out of it permanently, and seen dozens of others do the same. Please stop listening to mainstream garbage. You were born healthy and beautiful. But we live in world, where it's more profitable to manage problems, than to fix them.

Until the old programs change, nothing changes. People only 'improve' how they feel. Circumstances around them change. And they feel like 'it helped' or 'it's fixed'. But no real cure or fix ever gets achieved... creating the same inside experiences - in new moments of time, appearing - ***different.*** *(Because the moments is new, the person is different, the situation is different. Plus the internal experiences, we don't even notice for what they are)*

If you have anxiety, social anxiety or any fear - you're NOT responsible for things that happened in the past, or the meaning you assigned when you barely knew this world...at the age of 3 or 7... Or the f\*ed up nature of confusion spreading online and people convincing each other of all kind of bull\*sht... or systems that are meant to *'help us' but make profit from us staying that way*... But you are responsible for ether allowing your mind to **work against you**, or taking control over it and making sure it **works in your favor.** Laying a red carped to a life you want to experience.

I recommend reading on how to reprogram your old subconscious patterns if you want to turn your life around. So that you can become a person who rewrites his story, and makes his life exciting to live. So that you can achieve your goals and dreams and impact those around you by how good you become.

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I joined an accountability group and other people helping me stick to my goals has been a life-changer. If you want to join, I left the invite in my bio.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

>“Then Ven. Sāgata went to the hermitage of the coiled-hair ascetic of Ambatittha, and on arrival—having entered the fire building and arranged a grass mat—sat down cross-legged with his body erect and mindfulness to the fore. The nāga (living in the fire building) saw that Ven. Sāgata had entered and, on seeing him, was upset, disgruntled, and emitted smoke. Ven. Sāgata emitted smoke. The nāga, unable to bear his rage, blazed up. Ven. Sāgata, entering the fire element, blazed up. Then Ven. Sāgata, having consumed the nāga’s fire with his own fire, left for Bhaddavatikā.

>“Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Bhaddavatikā as long as he liked, left on a walking tour to Kosambī. The lay followers of Kosambī heard, ‘They say that Ven. Sāgata did battle with the Ambatittha nāga!’

>“Then the Blessed One, having toured by stages, came to Kosambī. The Kosambī lay followers, after welcoming the Blessed One, went to Ven. Sāgata and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to him, ‘What, venerable sir, is something the masters like that is hard for you to get? What can we prepare for you?’

>“When this was said, some group-of-six bhikkhus said to the Kosambī lay followers, ‘Friends, there is a strong liquor called pigeon’s liquor (the color of pigeons’ feet, according to the Commentary) that the bhikkhus like and is hard for them to get. Prepare that.’

>“Then the Kosambī lay followers, having prepared pigeon’s liquor in house after house, and seeing that Ven. Sāgata had gone out for alms, said to him, ‘Master Sāgata, drink some pigeon’s liquor! Master Sāgata, drink some pigeon’s liquor!’ Then Ven. Sāgata, having drunk pigeon’s liquor in house after house, passed out at the city gate as he was leaving the city.

>“Then the Blessed One, leaving the city with a number of bhikkhus, saw that Ven. Sāgata had passed out at the city gate. On seeing him, he addressed the bhikkhus, saying, ‘Bhikkhus, pick up Sāgata.’

>“Responding, ‘As you say, venerable sir,’ the bhikkhus took Ven. Sāgata to the monastery and laid him down with his head toward the Blessed One. Then Ven. Sāgata turned around and went to sleep with his feet toward the Blessed One.

>So the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying, ‘In the past, wasn’t Sāgata respectful to the Tathāgata and deferential?

>“‘Yes, venerable sir.’

>“‘But is he respectful to the Tathāgata and deferential now?’

>“‘No, venerable sir.’

>“‘And didn’t Sāgata do battle with the Ambatittha nāga?’

>“‘Yes, venerable sir.’

>“‘But could he do battle with even a salamander now?’

>“‘No, venerable sir.’”

>**Object:**

>Alcohol means any alcoholic beverage made from grain, yeast, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include whiskey, beer, vodka, and gin.

>Fermented liquor means any alcoholic beverage made from flowers, fruits, honey, sugar, or any combination of ingredients. Examples now would include wine, mead, and rum.

>Together, the two terms are meant to cover all kinds of alcoholic beverages.

>There is some controversy as to what other substances would be included in this factor in line with the Great Standards. Because the Canon repeatedly criticizes alcohol on the grounds that it destroys one’s sense of shame, weakens one’s discernment, and can put one into a stupor—as happened to Ven. Sāgata—it seems reasonable to extend this rule to other intoxicants, narcotics, and hallucinogens as well. Thus things like marijuana, hashish, heroin, cocaine, and LSD would fulfill this factor. Coffee, tea, tobacco, and betel do not have this effect, though, so there is no reason to include them here.

>Perception as to whether a liquid counts as alcohol or liquor is not a mitigating factor here. Thus a bhikkhu drinking champagne that he thinks to be carbonated apple juice would fall under this factor, regardless of his ignorance.

>**Effort:**

>The Vibhaṅga defines drinking as taking even as little as the tip of a blade of grass. Thus taking a small glass of wine, even though it might not be enough to make one drunk, would be more than enough to fulfill this factor.

>The Vibhaṅga does not, however, indicate how offenses are to be counted here. According to the Commentary, the number of offenses involved in taking an alcoholic drink is determined by the number of separate sips. As for intoxicants taken by means other than sipping, each separate effort would count as an offense.

>**Non-offenses:**

>The Vibhaṅga states that there is no offense in taking items that are non-alcoholic, but whose color, taste, or smell is like alcohol. Thus, for example, carbonated apple juice that resembles champagne would not be grounds for an offense.

>There is also no offense in taking alcohol “cooked in broth, meat, or oil.” The Commentary interprets the first two items as referring to sauces, stews, and meat dishes to which alcoholic beverages, such as wine, are added for flavoring before they are cooked. Because the alcohol would evaporate during the cooking, it would have no intoxicating effect. Foods containing unevaporated alcohol—such as rum babas—would not be included under this allowance.

>As for alcohol cooked in oil, this refers to a medicine used in the Buddha’s time for afflictions of the “wind element.” The Mahāvagga (VI.14.1) allows this medicine for internal use only as long as the taste, color, and smell of the alcohol are not perceptible. From this point, the Vinaya-mukha argues that morphine and other narcotics used as painkillers are allowable as well.

>In addition, the non-offense clauses contain a phrase that can be read in two different ways. The first way would be, “With regard to molasses and emblic myrobalan, (there is no offense) if he drinks unfermented ariṭṭha.” This is the way the Commentary interprets the phrase, which it explains as follows: Ariṭṭha is the name of an aged medicine, made from emblic myrobalan, etc., whose color, taste, and smell are like alcohol, but which is not alcoholic. This item, however, would seem to come under the first non-offense clause.

>Another way to read the phrase would be to take ariṭṭha as an adjective, which would yield, “With regard to molasses and emblic myrobalan, (there is no offense) if he drinks what has not fermented and not turned bad.” Perhaps the mixture of emblic myrobalan and molasses was used to make a type of toddy, in which case the allowance would grant permission for the mixture to be drunk before it had fermented. This allowance could then be extended to liquids like apple cider consumed before it has turned alcoholic.

>**Summary:**

>Taking an intoxicant is a pācittiya offense regardless of whether one is aware that it is an intoxicant.

Anxiety isn't some magic or things that most people talk and say it is. It's very simple - it's a combination of 2 things:

**1. The mind is designed to predict potential danger and threat to help us survive.** What most people don't see however, is that while we have the obvious, outside experiences - like rejection or a tiger on the loose... we also have internal painful experiences we once felt - internal experiences. Our minds can't tell the difference between emotional and physical danger... so when you have to do public speaking for example, it already knows... before you even go... that there's a potential of you re-experiencing your *old experiences... judgement... potential humiliation... appearing not good enough etc.*

This is not who you are... or some disease. This is the meaning you assigned when you were like 4-7 years old. And our brains don't know time... so they keep running those old programs and habits - until we change them directly *(and sadly therapy still fails to do that...)*

This is the only reason why one person stands in a club, wants to approach someone, and feels anxiety straight away, before even moving a muscle... getting thoughts like *'what if he/she doesn't like me?' or 'I'm not drunk enough'*.... trying to find a safe way, not to get rejected or emotionally hurt. Even if rationally situation is obviously not threatening... While another person, does not feel rejection to be that bad. So he/she doesn't get anxiety triggered... thoughts arise more positive *'I wonder where she's from?' 'I should go over'* and it just feels new.. uncertain... still adrenaline flows the body, but without acting like a *potential threat.*

But for the other person, literally it feels like as if you knew there's a shark in the water, you fear it, and you're afraid to go anywhere close to the water. But in that situation, there's no shark *- it feels like an invisible barrier.*

**2. The body is influenced by our health and sensitivity.** If we lack hormonal health and energy... and our balance shifts into sensitive biology - from hormone injected foods, unhealthy diet, late-night sleep, coffee/sugar, alcohol etc. Then our body KNOWS automatically... we are more ***vulnerable.***  This makes ALL anxieties... negative thoughts, worries, fears - Worse. We also experience them, stronger.

And when people have no good hormones, and only weak hormones - people get thrown into ***fear.*** Uncertainty. Unknown. *=* ***A panic attack.***

This is easy stuff in medicine. Yet nobody addresses the root cause, the old programming and the health. And instead keeps people convinced that you have a this disease label and you have to cope/live with. It's a bunch of garbage. I myself came out of it permanently, and seen dozens of others do the same. Please stop listening to mainstream garbage. You were born healthy and beautiful. But we live in world, where it's more profitable to manage problems, than to fix them.

Until the old programs change, nothing changes. People only 'improve' how they feel. Circumstances around them change. And they feel like 'it helped' or 'it's fixed'. But no real cure or fix ever gets achieved... creating the same inside experiences - in new moments of time, appearing - ***different.***  *(Because the moments is new, the person is different, the situation is different. Plus the internal experiences, we don't even notice for what they are)*

If you have anxiety, social anxiety or any fear - you're NOT responsible for things that happened in the past, or the meaning you assigned when you barely knew this world...at the age of 3 or 7...

At Number 10: **Mosa Meat** 

– The company that kickstarted the cultivated meat movement, real beef without slaughter. Funded by everyone from Google Founders to Leonardo Dicaprio.

At Number 54: **Solar Foods**

– Making food from air using CO₂, water, and electricity, literally food from nothing. Yes that’s right, they sequester carbon and turn it into protein, the ultimate sustainable 2 for 1 punch, has a blank grant checkbook from the EU.

At Number 76: **LIVEKINDLY**

– Building global plant-based food brands to challenge legacy meat at scale.

At Number 82: **Tropic Biosciences**

– Using gene editing to future-proof crops like bananas and coffee against climate change. “It is the one that is most adaptable to change.”

i.e. ANIC owns a significant % of each of the above companies and an additional 20 in the field.

No ETF, no venture capital fund, no food-tech incubator on Earth is as concentrated in the future of food as Agronomics.

It’s easy to get caught up in short-term market noise. Money screaming out of America, interest rate speculation still dominating headlines and commodities stretched to record highs. But real innovation doesn’t happen in hype bubbles, it happens where necessity meets breakthrough.

Food prices are still high. Supply chains are still broken. Climate pressure is only increasing. Governments are scrambling for scalable solutions. And while everyone else chases the next big tech trend, Agronomics has been building a portfolio of companies that are actually solving core global problems. 

This isn’t theory. This is TIME magazine confirming that four of the world’s most promising green tech companies are building the future of food and they’re **all sitting in one portfolio** that is [**still trading under NAV**](https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/content/d713b81b-6f26-4226-a360-864840a9d2c2).

   * got into Paris around 11am and Airbnb check in was 4pm. Dropped off bags early then went to a nearby bakery for lunch.  
   * Went to **Shakespeare and Company** bookstore, stood in line for about 10 minutes and then walked around inside for 15 to look at book and vibe in the old shop
   * 2pm timed entry tickets for **Sainte Chappelle** and **Conciergerie**. You have to go to Sainte Chappelle first if you get the combined ticket, but the exit spits you out close to the Conciergerie entrance. The chapel was beautiful and small, Conciergerie was large but not too bad of a walk for people that had been traveling a lot up until that point.
* Sunday (Day 2)
   * **Palace of Versailles** was extremely crowded for 2pm entry, would not recommend the time that we booked as it was difficult to walk through a majority of the rooms without bumping into people and at times there were tour groups blocking doorways to get into the next room. 
      * Lots of old stone pathways this day, recommend paying attention to footwear and wear sheddable layers
      * Grounds are free to walk around (no ticket needed) and we enjoyed this part the most even if it was a bit busy by 3pm when we got outside.
   * Went to **Librairie Delamain** near the Louvre to get some French language books. They've been at that location for over 300 years but book store is bright and modern and I found my book easily.
   * Walked to **Bowly Wood** for casual Indian food dinner. Good food and fast, recommend if you're in the area and can get there around open time. They were empty when we walked in and filled up within 15 minutes of us sitting down. 
* Monday (Day 3)
   * **Arc de Tiomphe** 10:50 timed entry was perfect. Didn't wait in line long to get in and the weather and view was great.
   * Took a short walk on **Champs-Elysees** after.
   * Went to **Ile Saint-Louis** for pho at **Ha Noi 1988**\- their pho was amazing and my husband couldn't get enough of their bahn mi. We went right at open and there were 6-8 other people also waiting for them to unlock the door.
   * Walked the ile, they have some small shops that are cute.
   * I like to crochet and found a yarn shop called **Lil Weasel** that we went to. They had an amazing selection and the yarn was much cheaper than the comparable enthusiast shops in Chicago.
   * Also walked around the **Eiffel Tower** later in the evening, didn't go up but it was prettier at night than in the day imo 
* Tuesday (Day 4)
   * **Notre Dame** at 9:15, was busy but not too crowded. Quiet and peaceful inside
   * Went to some shops for caffeinne and souvenirs this day
      * **Chocolats Foucher**
      * **Noir coffee shop (it's a chain but good coffee)**
      * **Diptyque (looked for any new stuff that came out)**
      * **Longchamp**
      * **Pierre San Express**
   * Frenchie reservation for dinner, our splurge meal
      * Service, food, and experience was excellent
* Wednesday (Day 5)
   * **Louve** 3:30 entrance, was pretty busy but not as bad as the Palace. Mona Lisa was extremely crowded, but Greek and Egyptian sculptures were good exhibits, along with the Louis XIV exhibit.
   * Got **Gili Gili** Japanese onigiri for lunch. Quick, cheap, and delicious.
   * Got macarons from **Gem la Patisserie Paris**. It was so good we went back the day before we left to bring some home for family.
   * Got a charcuterie board dinner (take away) from **Au Petit Buron** and had it with baguette from a nearby bakery. Highly recommend, the owner talked us through the different options and let us sample a ton from his shop. He also recommended a restaurant that we ended up not being able to book because they were full the days before we left, but it looked really good (Ze Kitchen Galerie)
* Thursday (Day 6)
   * Went to **Chateau Saint-Germain-en-Laye**. This area is slept on in my opinion. Extremely interesting old small chateau and beautiful grounds next to a cute small town reachable from center of Paris by 45 min train
   * Did more shopping 
      * **Papier Tigre** \- good quality, made in France stationary
      * **Fromagerie Crèmerie Frescolet** \- Pigalle - got butter for take home here and staff was very helpful
   * 6pm **D'Orsay** entrance time. Was relatively busy but didn't have trouble seeing everything we wanted to see. Loved the Van Gogh and 5th floor exhibit in general
* Friday (Day 7)
   * Went to **Marmottan** right at open, not busy. Small museum but layout was interesting and loved their Monet collection. Walking through the park nearby was also peaceful to and from public transit
   * Rest of the day was unstructured, so last minute souvenir shopping and dinner at **Go Oun** since we wanted Korean food.
* Saturday (Day 8/leaving)
   * Dedicated morning to packing and leaving. Had our last coffees and croissants of course at a nearby bakery. **Land & Monkey** was a vegan place near our airbnb that somehow made everything crispy and buttery and flaky without dairy.",11,1743332490.0,ParisTravelGuide,1,1.0,False

Hey friends! Have you ever felt like your day is chopped into a gazillion pieces, like a confusing giant jigsaw puzzle, all thanks to time blocking? I hear you. I used to be the over-enthusiastic person color-coding every half-hour of my life! 🙈

But hear me out—what if there’s a more natural, fluid way to conquer your days without the *ding, ding* of alarms every thirty minutes? Say hello to **Habit Stacking**: the art of piggybacking new habits onto existing ones, creating a mini-routine that actually sticks! 🤯

**Why give it a whirl?**  
- It’s less overwhelming—bye-bye, frantic schedule!
- Works with your natural flow rather than against it.
- Low-key increases productivity, without the *extra* effort.

Here’s a little scenario to paint the picture—because who doesn't love a good story? 🎨

**Meet Alex: A Serial Time Blocker (Converted!)**  
1. **Morning Chaos**:  
   🕔 7:00 am: Wake up (snooze 3 times, blearily glance at phone).
   🕦 7:30 am: Shower as fast as humanly possible.
   🕒 8:00 am: Breakfast with no time to taste... cereal waterfalls, anyone?  

**But then, the Habit Stack Spill!**  
- **Habit**: Morning coffee 🥳  
- **Stack it with**: Reading 10 pages of a book.  
- **Add another one**: While sipping that caffeine, think of 3 things you're grateful for.  

Suddenly, 7:00–8:00 am becomes a peaceful powerhouse of productivity. No more scatterbrain mornings. And Alex, well... they're not diving back into the chaos anymore.

You might wonder, “Seriously, just stacking habits can change my day?” Well, why not? Ever consider how many things we mindlessly do daily could morph into small wins? 🤔

So, here’s a fun challenge: for one week, skip the rigid blocks and see how habit stacks work for you. 🌟

Wondering which habits to stack? Here’s some inspo:  
- **Teeth Brushing Time**  
  - **Stack**: Listen to a podcast or practice positive affirmations.
  
- **Lunch Break**  
  - **Stack**: Quick stretch exercises or a 5-minute meditation.  

- **Evening Wind-Down**  
  - **Stack**: Journaling while sipping herbal tea.

Just try it out. Feel the magic when habits seamlessly merge. Let's chat about those amazing little victories that keep life moving forward. Who knows, maybe you’ll uncover your next big game-changer! 🚀✨",1,1743332120.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Ever tried time blocking and ended up feeling like your calendar was running *you* instead of the other way around? 🙋‍♂️ That was me last month—almost had a meltdown trying to cram every minute into a neat little box. Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.

**Why Time Blocking Wasn't My BFF:**  
- **Over-scheduling chaos:** My days looked like a puzzle with missing pieces. Every unexpected phone call or errand meant playing calendar Jenga.
- **Burnout, anyone?** I was running programs that were exhausting me rather than inspiring productivity. Like energy vampires—sans the cool wardrobe.
- **Life’s little curveballs:** Bat’s out of nowhere (think: surprise visits, lost socks, existential crises) made my blocks crumble.

So what saved me? 🦸‍♀️ Introducing: *Energy Optimization!* Forget time management. Let’s talk energy. Think about it—ever have one of those days where you’re a human dynamo in the morning but a zombie by 3 PM? Yeah, that’s your energy talking.

Here’s how I flipped the script:

➡️ **Identify Your Power Hours:**
   - Mornings for me are less about lattes and more about laser focus. So I tackle brain-heavy stuff post-coffee.
   - Afternoons? Perfect for mundane tasks like emails and *sigh* admin stuff.

➡️ **Listen to Your Body & Mind:**
   - Energy dips? Pop in some tunes or take a strolling break. My dogs never looked happier, and I dodged a midday slump.

➡️ **Make Recharging an Artform:**
   - Instead of squeezing in meditation like a rushed dentist appointment, I embraced mini breaks. Dance-offs in the kitchen? More effective than you’d think.🕺

➡️ **Flexibility is Queen:**
   - Some days, plans fall apart. And that’s okay! Friday’s pizza night may turn into ""contemplate the universe on your balcony night.” 🎉

By focusing on when I was most “alive,” I saved a cool *10 hours* a week, which I like to think of as Level-Up Time. More for hobbies, Netflix, or, you know, existential angst explorations.

Riding the energy wave rather than letting the clock bully me was a game-changer. Anyone else made a similar switch or have some energy hacks up their sleeve? Let me know how you’re crushing it, one energy spike at a time. ✌️

last year I saw him every night, when the gym was almost empty, so we recognized each other's existence (sometimes he even waved at me on the streets).

however, we never spoke and, when I stopped seeing him, I felt bad because I really wanted to know him better (and there had been opportunities).

as I said at the beginning, yesterday I saw him again and it was a shock because I thought he had moved away or that he had left the gym.

I didn't recognize him right away, but when I did I knew that I had to AT LEAST exchange a word so as not to live with remorse.

so I went to him and said ""excuse me, do we know each other? because I have the impression that I have already seen you, did you often come here to the gym some time ago?"" 

he was a little shocked but he smiled and said he remembered me! 

we started talking and he seemed really happy, so i suggested we grab a coffee sometime. 

now, i know the story is all about him. but i am SO happy i approached him, because that is just not my thing.

Last summer, I (F, 18) have visited my mother's side of the family for holidays. Four years ago, my family had moved to another country, so whenever we come to our hometown, we stay at my aunt's and uncle's house. 

My cousin, let's call him Dennis, (M, 19) had always been problematic. When we were younger, I was bullied by him. He tormented me for years, and whenever my mom, or I, spoke about it, my uncle and aunt defended his behaviour, which I believe had led Dennis to become a manipulator he is today. As we grew up together, I've watched his lies evolve from ""silly kid stuff"" to lying about his friend laying in a hospital to get what he wants. 

So, back to that. It was evening, and me and my brother (M, 15) have made a plans to go out to the city, get a coffee and go shopping. We invited Dennis to come along, he agreed. After an hour and a half of him getting ready, I went to check on him. He was nowhere to be found. It had seemed that he left. My brother and I were confused, and slightly frustrated, but we decided to not let it ruin our evening and to just go. Just as we were about to leave, my grandma got a call from Dennis. 

Dennis was all worked up, talking frantically and incoherently. He told her that his friend, Linda, had gotten into a car crash and that he has to go to a hospital to see her. Upon hearing the news, my brother and I didn't go out to city, because how could we? Both of us know this girl. You could imagine everything that went through our heads. We sat up  for hours, waiting for an update. Shocker, the update never came, because Linda was never in the a car crash to begin with. 

Since Dennis had let grandma know at which intersection the supposed crash happened, my uncle called the police to ask about it. This is a small town, so if this had happened, the word definitely would have gotten out. Police knew nothing about it. Then, he called the only hospital in the place, asking if Linda was admitted. She wasn't. 

What really happened was, before going out, my uncle gave Dennis twenty bucks to ""treat"" me and my brother. When Dennis got his hands on the money, he disappeared. This isn't unusual behaviour, since he has a history of stealing cash from my uncle, aunt and my mom to go out clubbing, or to spend it on crypto currency (lmao). This time, he went out clubbing with his friends, which is probably why he took all that time getting ready in the first place. (Also, I know twenty bucks doesn't sound like a huge deal, but in the economy of my eastern European home country, you can get a whole private booth for that amount). 

In the morning, when he came home, he was confronted about it. He didn't give in, he just pushed his lie further, even as all the evidence pointed otherwise. Neither me, or my brother, took part in this ""intervention"". I just never wanted to see him again. In conclusion, Dennis suffered no consequences due to the poor parenting of his parents, and a day later, it was as if nothing had happened. It got swept under the rug, and no one ever talked about it again.

Now, we are going to my home country for Easter holidays, and I do not want to step my foot into that house. My mom told me not to let one bad apple spoil the bunch. She had also told me that my cousin is sick, and that he is seeing a therapist about it, but I highly doubt he can change. My uncle and aunt would be deeply saddened if I don't visit, and my grandma is old and doesn't have much time left, so this could very well be my last chance to see her. 

The thing is, as cruel as it sounds, I don't care. I believe they all took a part into raising Dennis into who he is, and now they're paying for it. It is not my problem and I will not be there when he pulls another stunt. 

So am I the asshole for cutting my mom's side of family off because of something that my cousin did?",20,1743331182.0,TwoHotTakes,6,1.0,False

1jn9owi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jn9owi/aitah_for_ending_a_friendship/,AITAH for ending a friendship,"I, 18f, became friends with a coworker the beginning of this winter. We texted for a bit trying to decide when to hangout and once we did we instantly clicked and began spending almost all of our time together. At the time I was using my dad’s car bc I didn’t have my own yet and she would ask me to take her to the gym, give her rides, etc. I would also give her rides knowing that the car was low on gas bc I didn’t want her to have to walk, and she would never offer gas money. Many times I would be so low on gas that I would sell my clothes or things bc I didn’t want to ask my dad bc I knew he did not like her. But it didn’t bother me since we had just gotten close and I didn’t see any of the red flags yet. I told her that I was bisexual early on in the friendship and she told me that she liked girls too but was only interested in the sexual side and not the romantic part of it. I kind of brushed it off as just a straight girl who thought being gay was kinky or something iykyk. As our friendship grew I found out that she did a lot of things I didn’t agree with, like she was sending booty pics to a guy she knew had a gf, she talked bad about a lot of friends and ex friends, and her friend group was mainly guys. Later in the friendship she also told me that she had a crush on a boy who was 14- mind you she is 19 now. I was very innocent going into the friendship, example I was a virgin, had not had my first kiss, had never smoked, drank, vaped, etc. We started smoking together and the first time I got high I had to drive. I didn’t like that since it’s obviously dangerous and I told her multiple times that if we were going to smoke I didn’t want to drive until I was sober, but almost every time I ended up having to drive us somewhere. She was also very inconsiderate of my personal space and would touch me in private places(etc my boobs, ass, lower stomach) and talk about my body, knowing that I was a person who was not physical or comfortable with that kind of thing. Once we were at one of her friends house and told me she wouldn’t leave until I had kissed the guy bc he supposedly had a crush on me or something. I ended up kissing him, didn’t like it, and when I told her I wasn’t into it and I didn’t really like him back she said I had used him and that I was a bad person. I felt genuinely bad bc I knew that it was one of his first kisses and I didn’t want to make him feel bad at all bc he was a nice guy. But she continued to make me feel bad about it even after I had told her I felt like shit for it, and even though she had pressured me into it. Around the beginning of march one of her friends passed away and as I have not experienced much death in my life I wasn’t sure how to comfort her but I did the best I could, including driving to her house in the middle of the night bc she was crying. As the time passed she would use the death to make me feel bad about not being able to hangout, or using his death to guilt trip me into thinking I was a bad friend bc I didn’t know how to comfort her, even though I did the best I could(watching TikTok’s on how to comfort a grieving person, making a care basket, buying her coffee and food etc). Later in the month I started talking to a guy who I liked but ended up being not a great guy. Her birthday was this past week and during that time i was talking to that guy again and he said something bad about my friend, and not thinking of how it would affect her I showed it to her bc I wanted her to see he was acting bad again. I could immediately tell that what he had said hurt her and immediately apologized and asked if she was okay. We went to the bathroom and talked about it and I apologized multiples times for showing it to her and blocked him. She has continued to bring this up even though every time she does I say that I am sorry. This weekend we made plans to go on a walk in the morning and we texted about fifteen minutes before I went to leave to pick her up and when I got there she wouldn’t answer calls, texts, knocks on the window. I sat outside in my car for an hour waiting for her until I eventually went home and back to bed. I hear nothing from her the rest of the day until in the evening when she calls me and tells me to pick her and a guy up bc she wanted to go to a party. I had already made plans to go on a date with a guy I had been talking to and didn’t want to go, but she asked me to just drive them and then I could go on my date. I drive them and otw I have to also pick up her sister as well. When we get to the party I come in to say hi to a few people and after about 10 minutes I let her know that I’m leaving for my date. Later that night she drunk texts me about how our friendship is bad bc I left her for a guy and didn’t like her friends and how I was being a bad friend to her. I texted back about it trying to understand why she was upset at me leaving when she literally told me I was just driving them. As we continued to talk she would guilt trip me using the passing of her friend, gaslight me, and overall just try and act like I was a bad friend. I got some advice from my sister and friend and they both agreed it seemed like a toxic friendship. I didn’t want to end the friendship on a bad note so I asked her if she wanted to meet up so we could talk, and she said yes but to give her an hour bc she wanted to take a nap. She didn’t respond all day long and finally after talking about it to another friend I blocked her. She reached out on TikTok and when I told her why I blocked her and I told her some of the reasons why( I haven’t listed everything here, it’s a lot) she began to full on crash out and calling me a whore and a little virgin bitch and saying that I was nothing before we were friends bc I was innocent and she showed me everything and I was lucky to be her friend, etc. She even asked me to come to her house and fight her which obviously is not happening bc I am not immature and I settle my conflicts with conversations like a mature person. I have to go to her house tomorrow morning to drop some clothes off that I had borrowed and I am genuinely scared that she is going to do something or  just yell at me. I have never had a friend that close before and breaking it off is painful but I know it’s for the best. ",2,1743331007.0,AITAH,9,0.67,False

Ever feel like time blocking is supposed to make you a productivity wizard, yet somehow, you *still* end up scrolling TikTok during your ""deep work"" blocks? 🤔 Been there, done that! I used to think time blocking was my magic wand for productivity, but it felt more like a straightjacket. So, I decided to shake things up with a little experiment—and it turned my schedule from hectic to heavenly.

**Let’s chat about time blocking and my sneaky 10-minute fix that actually saved me 12 hours a week! Spoiler: You don't have to be an organizational ninja to make it work.**

---

🚀 **The Time Blocking Trap**: 
- I’d start my day full of ambitious blocks... only to derail by noon. Coffee breaks morphed into Instagram black holes, and I’d be in panic mode by 3 PM.
- Who else can relate to that sinking feeling of looking at your perfectly planned day and realizing it's 3:30 PM and you've done exactly... none of it? We’re all friends here, it’s a safe space! 😂

**Here’s what I did differently:** 

🌟 **The 10-Minute Scheduling Magic**:
1. **Micro-blocks to the rescue**: Instead of giant, monster-sized blocks, I broke things down into 10-minute chunks. Why? Because tricking my brain into thinking ""It's just 10 minutes!"" is much easier than ""I’ll work for **two hours** straight.""
  
2. **Priority Spotlight**: I began each day by highlighting just *two* things I HAD to finish. Anything more zapped my energy quicker than a toddler wired on sugar.

3. **Flex Time w/ Unscheduled Blocks**: I *scheduled* time for distractions! Sounds wild, right? But knowing I had buffer time made it less tempting to wander off when I should’ve been focusing.

4. **Progress Over Perfection**: Accepted that some days are trainwrecks, and *that’s okay*. Reset, recharge, and get back on track.

**Let’s get real, why does it work?**

- Short blocks make tasks less scary... ever notice how starting is often the hardest part?
- Allows for a mix of structure and spontaneity. You keep the day productive but flexible, preventing burnout.
  
---

It felt a little silly at first, but this became my secret sauce for navigating the chaos. Now I'm that annoyingly zen person who gets stuff done *and* has time to relax. Who would've thought, right?

So, what say you? Have you tried time blocking? Found anything that makes it less... well, maddening? Drop your wisdom or let me know if my 10-minute tweak works for you too. 😊 Let's create magic in those time blocks, folks!

Cheers to reclaiming time and staying sane,
[Your Name]

1jn9h2m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jn9h2m,In-depth reviews of some niche and designer perfumes,"Hello to all the fragrance enthusiasts, it's been over a few weeks since I last shared my in-depth reviews of some niche and designer perfumes(here's the link). Below I'll be sharing another set of detailed, personal opinions on some 10ml designer and niche decants that I purchased from Scentoria(Pranay) and one from u/scentmode. I decided to upgrade a few of them to 10 ml sizes after I completely went through a few 1/2/2.5 ml samples. 

🔵 N.B. - To enhance your reading experience, I've divided the reviews into two segments - this is the first half that contains 8 fragrances and there will be a second half that'll also contain 8 fragrances which I'll post sometime in the near future🙌🏼🥺. 

⚠️  A little side note - We all know that each of us perceives scents differently. So, what I dislike in a scent may be enjoyed by you, and vice versa. If you've tried any of the scents below, please share your experience in the comments section. I'd love to hear your thoughts! 

Before starting, there are certain things I would like to share - 

❤ Accords and notes that I am loving on me after a few months of sampling - *Woody, spicy, smoky, earthy aromatics, ambery, nutty, bitter and spicy non-gourmand gourmands, delicate florals(very recent realization), leather and musk.* 

🚫 Accords and notes that I tend to avoid - *Citrusy freshies, blue freshies, Jammy florals, lactonic scents, cherry and sweet vanillas.* 

✅ Accords that I'm done exploring since my last review - *Rose(Found), Fig(Found), Tuberose(Found), Jasmine(Found), Sandalwood(Found) and Lactonic scents(Didn't work out).* 

🔍 Accords and notes I'm currently exploring - *Tea, Neroli, Orange Blossom, Ylang-Ylang, Immortelle, Patchouli, Iris, Soapy accord, Guaiac Wood, Barbershop Fougère and Animalic notes such as Civet and Castoreum.* 

#👉🏼THE REVIEWS 👈🏼 

1. AMETHYST HAZE BY CAROLINA HERRERA - 

🍃 Notes : *Cardamom, Pink Pepper, Lavender, Coffee, Cashmere Wood, Bourbon Vanilla and Patchouli.* 

🍃 What am I actually smelling : It opens with a generic blue freshie. After 20-25 mins, it actually unfurls into a dominant lavender, something earthy and balmy but that blue freshie note just stays in the background. I could definitely taste the elaichi, I mean to say when I'm exhaling I can literally feel that elaichi scent at the back of my throat. 

🍃 Remarks : This opening disappointed me big time. It has all the notes that I love - Cardamom✅, Lavender✅, Coffee✅ but the overall result is just...meh☹! This doesn't feel like a perfume from a confidential line, as I'm getting a generic blue freshie note from the opening that persists for an hour. However, the dry down is where the scent redeems itself; the deodorant-like opening recedes into the background, and the lavender and cardamom become more prominent, with a subtle touch of vanilla. 

🍃 Performance : 7-7.5 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it dries down to this aromatic, cardamom-y powdery vanilla scent. 

🍃 Full bottle worthy : Nope due to the opening. 

2. AUDACE BY PROFUMUM ROMA - 

🌿 Notes : *Vetiver, Tonka Bean, Licorice and Cedar.* 

🌿 What am I actually smelling : Imagine heating a tawa, add some fennel seeds, some methi and add a ginormous amount of khus(vetiver) on the tawa and keep roasting them until your entire house starts smelling like roasted khus and sauf! 

🌿 Remarks : This is hands down one of the best vetivers out there(besides Lunar Vetiver, Sultan Vetiver and Sycomore). It's well-blended and absolutely divine😍! If you spray this and close your eyes you will be immediately transported to an enchanting little shop nestled in a quiet little corner of a street where you'll find a treasure trove of botanical wonders including varities of herbs and a collection of vintage books on alchemy! 🌱🌿🍀 

🌿 Performance : 6-6.5 hrs on skin and the whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hour, it pretty much settles down to a green powdery and woody scent. 

🌿 Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah. Drown me in this stuff! 💚 

3. BLACK DATURA BY MILLER HARRIS - 

🕯Notes : *Tuberose, Datura, Pink Peppercorn, Ylang Ylang, Myrrh, Peru Balm, Incense, Labdanum, Musk, Amber, Chinese Cedarwood, Haitian Vetiver and Amyris.* 

🕯What am I actually smelling : Something in the opening notes smells vaguely of varnish, followed by a peppery slap, and then a very faint tuberose emerges, which briefly veers in the direction of agarbatti before being overtaken by a prominent blend of sauf and saw dust! Imagine a combination of old book, leather, varnish, a hint of henna, some fennel, and sawdust🤎💙! 

🕯 Remarks : This perfume legit embodies the essence of 'black cat energy'🐈‍⬛🤎! It's an elegant yet a dark scent. I was baffled, unsure of what I was even smelling😵! There's something enigmatic about this fragrance, evoking a mystery of being an aloof, powerful presence at a party, with secrets unknown to those around you😌😈! 

🕯 Performance : 8 hrs on skin and the whole day on clothes. After the 2nd hr, this settles into a prominent roasted fennel-ish, resinous, balm-ish aromatic woody scent. 

🕯 Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah! Drown me in this stuff(2)! 🤎 

4. DANS TES BRAS BY FREDERIC MALLE- 

☁️ Notes : *Violet, Cashmeran, Heliotrope, Sandalwood and White Musk.* 

☁️ What am I actually smelling : I'm struggling to describe this scent, but I'll try my best. The fragrance. opens with a varnish note, which is very reminiscent of an art museum. It's as if you're standing in front of a painting with a wooden frame, and as you draw closer, you can almost smell the varnish mixed with the scent of the frame🖼. After 10-15 minutes, the fragrance shifts, and I'll try describing it in two ways. Firstly, it smells like a misty pine forest, where you're walking through the trees, plucking a few leaves, and catching the whiff of the sap. Alternatively, it's similar to the scent of a wooden floor which is freshly cleaned with phenyl😐😵! 

☁️ Remarks : Woah😳! I rarely have a visceral reaction to perfumes, but this one right here elicited a strong response! This is one of the best and most unique offerings from this house. To me, it evoked the feeling of being in a museum❤, as it literally captures the scent of a museum. I must admit, I didn't love it at first sniff; my initial impression was - ""that's a weird note"", due to the prominent green pine accord, which reminded me of phenyl! However, after six sprays, I grew to appreciate this complex and mind-boggling fragrance❤🖼! 

Performance : 8 hrs on skin and the whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, the green pine accord gets more and more prominent along with the soapy musk. And eventually becoming a beautiful skin scent. 💛 

☁️ Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah. Drown me in this stuff(3)! 💛 

5. EAU MOHELI BY DIPTYQUE - 

🍌 Notes : *Pink pepper, Ylang-ylang, Patchouli, Ginger, Vetiver, Benzoin and Incense.* 

🍌 What am I actually smelling : The yellow florals are loud and clear in the opening, and I definitely pick up on the ginger note, which is reminiscent of freshly peeled and crushed ginger mixed with heady florals(if that makes sense🙁) - that's the exact scent I smell in the opening. After about 10-15 minutes, the unlit incense note hits me hard. It reminds me of the small agarbatti stalls found on sidewalks. The scent is similar to the distant aroma of incense you catch before approaching the stalls. As it dries down, the fragrance becomes very soapy, reminding me of hotel toiletries and also somewhat of Dior's Pure Poison🤔! 

🍌 Remarks : Okay this is - Secret Temptations gone niche🤧😶! It is a relatively linear scent with a dominant Ylang-Ylang accord. The fragrance is sharp and green, but lacks sweetness and has a clean, musky quality to it. The incense note is also reminiscent of Indian weddings, particularly the rooms where guests prepare and touch up their makeup and perfumes😁. This scent has a very realistic yellow floral profile. In fact, if someone is unfamiliar with the smell of yellow florals, this fragrance serves as a good example of a realistic Ylang-Ylang scent! Also, as an EDT, the performance is pretty solid. 

🍌 Performance : 5.5-6 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it dials down to a soapy floral and musky scent slightly reminiscent of Dior Pure Poison. 

🍌 Full bottle worthy : Nope, unless I want to layer this perfume with something more woody or sappy. And since I'm not quite into layering perfumes, so nope. 

6. FLEUR DE PEAU BY DIPTYQUE - 

⏳ Notes : *Aldehydes, Pink Pepper, Angelica and Bergamot, Iris and Turkish Rose, Musk, Ambrette (Musk Mallow), Carrot, Ambergris, Sandalwood, Leather and Amberwood.* 

⏳ What am I actually smelling : It opens with the scent of toiletries typically provided by resorts. Now that I think about it, it genuinely smells like the scent of someone who has just washed themselves with those Medimix soaps that hotels used to offer🥺❤. Note, however, that it doesn't actually smell like Medimix😅. I'm trying to convey the image of how you'd smell after stepping out of the washroom, freshly washed with that soap😌. As time passes, it reminds me of another distinct scent. Specifically, I'm thinking of those large clothing stores that sell sarees, suits, and unstitched fabrics. These stores often have a bhagwan ka asan placed near the cashier's desk. The clothing racks are usually adjacent to this asan, and the fragrance of incense sticks wafts over to the clothes. Imagine the shopkeeper getting a garment from the rack and handing it to you - that's the exact scent you get from this perfume 😅🤔! 

⏳ Remarks : The above description filled me with nostalgia, reminding me of the times when my mother would take me shopping at clothing stores(well to be honest, had to drag me to the stores because I hated shopping😅🤭). This fragrance may be simple, but it kind of evokes memories of mundane, everyday experiences. It reminds you of the freshness that you feel when stepping out of the shower, or the scent that wafts out when you open a new bottle of fabric conditioner, or even the smell of freshly washed clothes. While this is a beautiful skin scent, unfortunately it's not quite suited to my tastes as it tends to get a little too floral😅! 

⏳ Performance : 9-10 hrs on skin and whole day on my clothes. After one point of time, it gets difficult to distinguish between the scent of my clothes and the perfume😳! 

⏳ Full bottle worthy : If L'Eau Papier didn't exist, then yes. But since it does, nope. 

7. LE LION DE CHANEL - 

🦁 Notes : *Bergamot, Lemon, Labdanum, Amber, Patchouli, Madagascar Vanilla, Musk and Sandalwood.* 

🦁 What am I actually smelling : It opens with a bright lemon-y opening, reminiscent of a citrusy deodorant. As it evolves, the middle accords becomes progressively similar to the those found in Guerlain's Shalimar😳😳! However, whereas Shalimar becomes creamy, Le Lion takes a different path - the scent of luxury car leather seats with Multani mitti paste applied all over it. I also get a pronounced scent of incense sticks and the Shingar liquid kumkum bindi, accompanied by a green and earthy note(patchouli). 

🦁 Remarks : There's a point during it's development where it has a striking resemblance to Shalimar🤔! However, the dry down is where Le Lion truly comes into its own😍😲! While Le Lion may not be unique, it's undoubtedly one of the finest resinous fragrances I've came across- a wearable, timeless scent that exudes charm with such finesse that it feels like the perfume is wearing me, rather than the other way around😭🙁😶🙄! As someone who appreciates polarizing scents, I feel that Le Lion has a certain ""character"" that sets it apart🤔❤. For me, Shalimar fell short in its dry down, despite a breathtakingly beautiful opening🙁! While Le Lion's opening was somewhat ordinary, but as the scent evolved, it just took my breath away💛💛😌. This fragrance is, without a doubt, a stunning masterpiece💛🧡. I had a 1.5 ml sample of this that I upgraded to a 10 ml decant. 

🦁 Performance : 10-10.5 hrs on skin and the entire day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, the leather scent becomes more prominent and something musky and freshly-cut furniture scent comes in the front with a warm resinous base underneath. 

🦁 Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah! Drown me in this stuff(4)! 🧡 

8. L'EAU PAPIER BY DIPTYQUE 

🍚 Notes : *White musks, Mimosa, Blonde woods accord and Rice steam accord.* 

🍚 What am I actually smelling : The opening reminds me of the musk of Fleur De Peau but without the floral notes and a very prominent green and woody accord which I think is the mimosa.  At this stage, it resembles that ""fresh out of a shower"" scent and and a familiar scent of drying your hair with the towel😳🥺. After 5-10 minutes, the savory chawal accord emerges, combining with dusty woods and a strong soapy musky accord reminiscent of luxury fabric care products🧼🧴! 

🍚 Remarks : While this scent may be the weakest from the house in terms of performance, it boasts one of the best scent profiles. If Diptyque were to start giving away their perfumes at a cheap price, I'd be the first in line to snag a L'Eau Papier😁😁 because this right here is a brilliantly crafted skin scent! It perfectly captures the essence of stepping out of the shower, feeling squeaky clean and refreshed, wearing freshly laundered clothes - this perfume embodies that fresh and rejuvenated feeling🧖‍♀️🧖‍♂️😌. There is no unnecessary floral notes that might clash with the savory rice accord, instead it features simple woods, green mimosa leaves and plenty of soapy musks🥺❤🧼. Until now, L'Eau Papier has been my favorite Diptyque(narrowly surpassing my beloved Philosykos. Philosykos is a little challenging to pull off without a supporting accord to balance the sapiness🌱🤔). I had a sample of this scent and immediately wanted a bigger decant, but unfortunately, Pranay didn't have one, so u/scentmode came to my rescue😁🤭❤. 

🍚 Performance : 3.5-4 hrs on skin and 10 hrs on clothes. After the 1st hr, it settles into a soft, musky, soapy, powdery accord that lingers on both my skin and clothes. You can still detect that rice accord if you bring your wrist to your nose and inhale the hell out it😶😶! 

🍚 Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah! Drown me in this stuff(5). 🤍 

Thank you so much for reading till the end 🥺🙏. I'll be posting the second part soon, in the coming days. Hope this helps❤🤭.

It's not from private customer but from a store that sells and fixes espresso machines, so the machine is already maintained and refurbished. Before I found this one I was considering Linea Micra as I don't really make coffee for more than myself at once, but since the price is already almost the same, maybe it's better for longevity? I think since that Linea Mini is not Mini R, it won't have features like preinfusion and shot timer, but I don't really care about those I think? I'd still use a scale under the cup. What do you guys think of this? Any Linea Mini from 2021-23 users?",1,1743329983.0,LaMarzocco,2,1.0,False
