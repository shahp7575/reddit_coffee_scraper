I wanted to share a recent project I finally completed — added a [pergolas for patio](https://lousol.com/patio-pergolas/) , and I’m beyond happy with the result.

The patio itself has been there for a while, but it always felt a bit bare and too exposed to the sun. After some research and inspiration from posts here, I decided to build a wooden pergola. It’s a simple structure with clean lines, and I added some climbing plants and string lights for extra coziness.

It honestly changed the whole vibe of the backyard — now it's a perfect space for morning coffee, evening hangouts, or even working outside. The pergola gives enough shade without completely blocking the light, and it just feels more *complete* now.

1kxbm1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxbm1o,A shot at a mid-century coffee table,"I wanted to make a small coffee table in the mid-century modern style (based on [this](https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/a61799016/diy-mid-century-coffee-table/)). The design is pretty simple and it only require simple crosscuts of a single panel. I hesitated between plywood and solid wood, and also between butt joints with dowels or miter with dowels. In the end i went for solid wood panels (epicea) with visible dowels made of contrasting wood (beech). 

The main issue I had was tear out at the edge when drilling for the visible dowels (visible at the far right on picture 3). I don't know if there is a trick to avoid that. Using smaller dowels (i used 6mm) might have reduced the issue but i'm not sure it would have looked nice

Finishing : bright oak stain then 4 coats of satin varnish (Syntilor bio). Feet are steel, bought used online. 

Overall quite pleased with the result, i think I managed to get the minimalist look. I think it lacks a nice round/chanfer edge made with a router (I don't have one), and the visible dowels aren't really necessary. ",1,1748419725.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,1.0,False

I fit or at least can fit the vague descriptions. As a matter of fact, when I was still in college for accounting and doing really well I went and sought out a secretary/bookkeeper position at a local law firm to pick up some experience. Showed up with a clean, put together appearance, combed hair, suit and tie, the works, and the knowledge to show I at least somewhat was a fit for that position. Blew that law firm's mind so much they took me out for coffee and offered to find me something a little less intensive to start with (the job they were offering had special retainer accounts I had never worked with and a lot of throughput, they didn't take me simply because they didn't want to throw me to the wolves). That obviously never went anywhere but my point is my accounting experience fits the business acumen side of things and my presentation/overall act is good enough to impress even employers with high standards (when they give me the chance, of course).

But that all aside, something seems off about all this, no? A 6 figure administrative job with no qualifications except generic buzzwords? What's the catch? Anyone have experience with similarly and ominously generous listings?",1,1748419711.0,Careers,0,1.0,False

I had been trying for a baby with my husband for three years—with zero luck.   
  
Then, one day, I took a prenatal vitamin in front of my bestie, who's a doctor.   
  
She grabbed the pill bottle, frowned, and crushed one into powder between her fingers.   
  
""This isn't a prenatal. It's birth control.""  
  
Her words sent a chill down my spine.  
  
I immediately sent the pills for lab testing.   
  
Turns out, I had been taking birth control for the past three years.   
  
Pills that Lucas Harrison gave me.  
  
Every single time before we were together, he'd coax me into swallowing one.   
  
I was about to confront him with the test results when a message popped up in our mutual friends' group chat—sent by Scarlett Bennett.   
  
The photo?  
  
A pregnancy test, bold and bright, with two dark pink lines.   
  
\[Babe, wanna make a bet?\]   
  
\[Do you think we're having a little Lucas or a little Scarlett?\]   
  
\[I'm betting on a little Lucas.\]   
  
Two minutes later, she pretended to be flustered.   
  
\[Oops, sorry, guys. Sent that to the wrong chat.\]   
  
\[Can't unsend it now, so just… pretend you didn't see anything.\]   
  
I let out a bitter laugh, my last shred of guilt vanishing in an instant.   
  
I finally replied to the one that got away—the man I should have never left.   
  
\[One month. I'll come with you.\]   
  
The group chat went dead silent.   
  
Then, someone finally broke the ice.   
  
\[Well, well… congrats, I guess?\]   
  
\[When did you guys get married?\]   
  
\[You didn't even tell us! We should've been there to celebrate.\]   
  
Someone sent a money transfer labeled as a wedding gift.  
  
Others followed suit.   
  
Scarlett played coy, adding two blushing emojis.   
  
\[Aww, thanks, guys. But don't make a big deal out of it, okay? Just pretend you never saw it.\]   
  
\[Come on, we can't ignore it. Even if we didn't get invited to the wedding, we're still friends.\]   
  
\[Exactly. You two finally got together—we have to give you our blessings.\]   
  
This group was full of Lucas' college buddies.   
  
After we got married, he had added me, saying, ""These are my close friends.""  
  
""You should get to know them.""  
  
When they asked who I was, all he said was:   
  
\[A friend.\]   
  
\[A friend? Then introduce her! Maybe one of the single guys here would be interested.\]   
  
Lucas stayed silent.  
  
So did I.   
  
I had been a silent observer in this group ever since.   
  
Back then, Scarlett had even scolded them.  
  
\[Don't act so desperate just because a girl joins the chat.\]   
  
\[If you want a girlfriend, go get one yourself.\]   
  
The Harrison and Sinclair families were both old money.  
  
Our families had been planning a grand wedding for us, but Lucas had brushed it off.   
  
""I'm at a critical stage in my career,” he had said.  
  
""I barely have time for a simple wedding, let alone a grand one.""  
  
""Let's talk about it later.""  
  
Later never came.   
  
Five years passed.   
  
I had long given up on the idea of a big wedding.  
  
If it happened, great.  
  
If not, whatever.   
  
Lucas' friends had no idea he was married.  
  
Let alone the fact that he hadn't married Scarlett—the girl everyone thought was his perfect match.   
  
The chat kept buzzing.  
  
My phone screen stayed lit in my grip.   
  
I stared at it, cold and numb, as tears rolled down my cheeks, my soul breaking with every drop.   
  
For a fleeting moment, I hoped Lucas would say it was all a lie.   
  
That it wasn't what it looked like.   
  
But despite all the notifications, the man at the center of it all—who was being tagged over and over—never said a word.   
  
Scarlett accepted the money transfers.   
  
\[Thanks, everyone! Consider this a little gift for the baby.\]   
  
\[Once the baby is born, we'll throw a party and invite you all!\]   
  
\[You all better show up! Baby says thanks in advance\~\]  
  
Scarlett had made her decision—they were having the baby.   
  
A suffocating weight settled on my chest.  
  
I pushed open the window, desperate for air.   
  
Standing on the balcony, I took deep, shaky breaths, but my heart still felt like it was being squeezed.   
  
The cold wind numbed my face, and after a while, I finally calmed down.  
  
I took screenshots of the group chat, then quietly left the group.   
  
I was still sitting in the corner of the balcony, lost in thought, when Lucas did something unusual—he came home early.   
  
He pulled me up from the ground and shut the window.   
  
""It's freezing. Sitting by an open window in the middle of winter—you trying to get sick?""  
  
I stared at him.  
  
He was adjusting my clothes like he actually cared, but something about him felt… off.   
  
Like a stranger.   
  
Was it guilt? Did he feel even a little bit guilty for what he'd done?   
  
I flinched away from his touch.   
  
""Don't touch me.""  
  
He hesitated, then finally met my eyes.  
  


Chapter 2

His expression shifted—like he was dealing with an unreasonable child.   
  
""Oh, this is about the group chat, isn't it?""  
  
He sighed, his tone light, like he was explaining something trivial.   
  
""Emily, before we got married, we agreed—this was just to keep our parents happy, right?""  
  
""They're happy with the way things are. I'm happy.""  
  
""So what exactly are you unhappy about?""  
  
Our marriage was never about love. Just obligation.   
  
The Harrison and Sinclair families had been close for generations.  
  
But while our parents were practically family, Lucas and I barely knew each other.   
  
I had studied abroad in high school while he stayed behind.  
  
We never talked, never kept in touch.   
  
Then, when I returned, our parents decided we were the perfect match.   
  
They pulled every trick in the book—crying, threatening, guilt-tripping.   
  
""This is the best decision for both of you!""  
  
""We've paved the way for your future, and you're telling me you'd rather struggle?""  
  
""That boyfriend of yours? Forget it. Over my dead body.""  
  
""Unless your father and I drop dead, this marriage is happening.""  
  
They were relentless. They took our credit cards, confiscated our phones, even stationed bodyguards outside our doors.   
  
Their only job? Making sure Lucas and I couldn't escape.   
  
In the end, I broke up with my boyfriend.  
  
Gave in. Let them win.   
  
Right before we got our marriage license, Lucas had told me coldly, ""Guess we're in this together. Just play along, and don't take it seriously.""  
  
I knew his heart belonged to Scarlett.   
  
But I never thought he'd be this blatant about it.   
  
Cheating was one thing.   
  
But secretly drugging me with birth control for three years—so I wouldn't get in the way of his real love life?   
  
It was disgusting.   
  
It was unforgivable.   
  
I took a deep breath, then asked the question I already knew the answer to.   
  
""So you're keeping this baby?""  
  
Scarlett wouldn't have accepted all those wedding gifts if Lucas hadn't given her the green light.   
  
She wouldn't set herself up like that unless she was absolutely sure.   
  
Lucas clenched his jaw.  
  
""Emily, I want a child.""  
  
My hand moved before I could think.   
  
The slap echoed through the room.   
  
It was all so ridiculous.   
  
I laughed—ugly, bitter laughter that mixed with my tears.   
  
Then I turned and stormed into the bedroom.   
  
The test results were still on the desk.  
  
The lab report. The hospital's diagnosis.   
  
I grabbed the papers and hurled them at him.   
  
""Lucas, read it yourself.”  
  
""You've been giving me birth control, haven't you? Disguised as folic acid.""  
  
Lucas froze, his hands trembling as he flipped through the test results over and over.   
  
His voice shook.  
  
""Emily…""  
  
""You fed me birth control pills for three years.""  
  
""And now you tell me you want a baby?""  
  
""If you were so set on having a kid with Scarlett, you could've just told me.""  
  
""I would've helped you keep it from our parents.""  
  
""But instead, you tricked me. You lied to me.""  
  
""I can accept a lot of things, Lucas. But I won't accept you hurting me.""  
  
Looking back on the past five years of our marriage, it all felt… surreal.   
  
For the most part, we had kept a respectful distance.  
  
But there were moments when things got complicated.   
  
Sometimes, after a few drinks, he would cling to me, his voice warm and slurred—   
  
""Babe, do you think we're happy? Cause I do.""  
  
Then he'd pull me in even closer.   
  
I'd try to make him sober up, but he'd just shake his head, tugging me back down.   
  
""Nothing works better than you staying right here with me.""  
  
At first, I wasn't sure if he was mistaking me for someone else.   
  
But over time, I stopped caring.   
  
I let myself enjoy those fleeting moments, let myself believe they meant something.   
  
He had his ways of making things feel real.   
  
On holidays, he played the perfect son-in-law, charming both sides of the family.   
  
He would wrap an arm around my waist in front of my parents and say, ""Don't worry, Emily's amazing.""  
  
""Marrying her is the best decision I've ever made.""  
  
And even though I knew it was all an act, a small part of me—one I hated—wanted to believe it.   
  
That maybe, even if we weren't in love, we could at least be family.   
  
But he had been feeding me birth control for three years, watching me take those pills without a word.   
  
If my bestie hadn't noticed, I would've kept taking them.   
  
Lucas' grip on the reports tightened.  
  
His hands were shaking now, his gaze unfocused.   
  
His voice came out hoarse, barely a whisper.  
  
""I didn't want to upset you.""  
  
""Just stop taking them from now on.""  
  
That was it.   
  
No apology. No regret.   
  
Just an excuse. A way out.   
  


Chapter 3

I let out a bitter laugh.   
  
Was he really worried about hurting me?  
  
Or was he just afraid that if I knew the truth, I wouldn't go along with his plans?   
  
Lucas' selfishness, his hypocrisy—it was suffocating.   
  
I felt sick.   
  
""You think this is easy to brush off?""  
  
My voice wavered, anger and heartbreak twisting in my chest.   
  
""Do you have any idea how many nights I lost sleep, thinking something was wrong with me?""  
  
I yanked the medical report from his hands, jabbing a finger at the results.   
  
""The doctor said my hormones are completely out of balance.""  
  
""That after taking birth control for so long, I might not even be able to have kids.""  
  
""You only care about having a baby with the woman you love.”  
  
My breath hitched.  
  
""Did you ever stop to think that I might want that too?""  
  
""Well, congratulations, Lucas.”  
  
I wiped at my face, but the tears just kept coming.  
  
""You don't have to worry about drugging me anymore.""  
  
""I probably won't be able to get pregnant anyway.""  
  
My whole body was trembling now.  
  
The weight of it all crashed down at once.   
  
""But it doesn't matter.”  
  
My voice broke. ""Because we're done.""  
  
""I hate you, Lucas.""  
  
After the lab confirmed what was in those pills, I went straight to the hospital to get checked out.   
  
I had held onto a sliver of hope.  
  
That maybe, just maybe, it wasn't too late.   
  
But when the doctor looked at me and said, It'll be difficult for you to conceive in the future—   
  
That's when the hatred started.   
  
Now, it had consumed me.   
  
I turned, walked into the bedroom, and locked the door behind me.   
  
Just as my computer screen lit up.   
  
Another message from Jason.   
  
He had been waiting for me overseas for a long time.   
  
Ever since we broke up, he had sent me an email every single week.   
  
And just like always, there it was—this week's message.   
  
I wiped my face hastily and forced myself to focus.   
  
Inside the email was a blurry image of a black hole.  
  
""The folic acid you gave me... it was birth control, wasn't it?""   
  
Lucas suddenly looked panicked, clutching both reports in his hands, flipping them back and forth.   
  
His voice trembled.  
  
""Emily...""   
  
""You fed me birth control for three years, and now you're telling me you want a baby?""   
  
""If you were so desperate to have a kid with Scarlett, you could've just told me.""  
  
""I would've helped you keep it from our parents.""   
  
""But instead, you disguised birth control as vitamins and tricked me into taking them.""   
  
""I can handle anything—except you hurting me like this.""   
  
Looking back on my five-year marriage to Lucas, it all feels... surreal.   
  
Most of the time, we were just polite roommates.  
  
But there were moments—brief, fleeting moments—where it felt real.   
  
Sometimes, after he'd had a few drinks, he'd cling to me, whispering over and over:   
  
""Baby, do you think we're happy? Cause I think we're happy.""   
  
Then he'd hold me tighter.   
  
I'd go to the kitchen to make him coffee to sober up, but he'd pull me back.  
  
""Nothing sobers me up better than you right here with me.""   
  
At first, I wasn't sure if he was imagining someone else when he held me.   
  
But after a while, I stopped questioning it.  
  
I let myself believe in those moments.   
  
He knew how to play the part.   
  
On holidays, he'd charm both sides of the family.   
  
He'd wrap an arm around my waist and reassure my parents, ""Don't worry, Emily's amazing.""   
  
""Marrying her was the best decision I ever made.""   
  
And even though I knew he was just acting, sometimes I'd let myself believe that fate had already decided our future.   
  
Maybe not as lovers, but at least as family.   
  
But he was cruel.   
  
Cruel enough to watch me take those pills for three years and say nothing.   
  
If it weren't for Claire, I never would've found out.   
  
His fingers shook as he held the report. His gaze was unfocused.   
  
His voice came out strained, like the words were stuck in his throat.  
  
""I just... I didn't want you to be upset.""   
  
""You don't have to take them anymore.""   
  
Two short sentences.  
  
No apology. No remorse.   
  
Just cowardice.   
  
I let out a cold laugh.  
  
So, were you worried about me being upset?  
  
Or were you just scared that if you told me the truth, you wouldn't get what you wanted?   
  
Lucas's selfishness, his deceit—it was all laid bare.   
  
And it made me sick.   
  
""Lucas, do you have any idea how much I blamed myself?""  
  
""How much I tortured myself thinking something was wrong with me?""   
  
I slowly took the hospital report from his hands, pointing at the results.   
  
""The doctor said the hormones in my body are completely out of balance from all the birth control.""  
  
""I might never be able to have kids now.""   
  
""You wanted to have a child with the person you love.""  
  
""Did it ever occur to you that I had the same right?""   
  
""Well, congratulations.""  
  
""You don't have to drug me anymore—I probably can't get pregnant anyway.""   
  
My voice cracked.  
  
More tears fell.   
  
My whole body shook from the weight of it all.   
  
""But it doesn't matter.""  
  
""Because there is no ‘us' anymore, Lucas. I hate you.""   
  
The moment I saw the test results, I made an appointment to see a doctor.   
  
I needed to know the truth.   
  
And it was just as I feared—I couldn't escape the damage those pills had done to my body.   
  
When the doctor told me that my chances of conceiving were slim, I started hating Lucas.   
  
Now, that hatred has reached its peak.   
  
I will never forgive him.

1kxbkli,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxbkli,Dazai and Odasaku’s relationship,"Hey everyone! I felt like writing something a bit interesting today 》》》Dazai and Odasaku’s relationship

There’s something quietly heartbreaking about Dazai and Odasaku’s relationship. It’s not loud, not dramatic — just two people sitting over coffee, carrying way too much weight in silence. They’re total opposites: Dazai, always dancing on the edge of life and death, and Oda, still believing in the goodness of people even when everything falls apart.
But that contrast — that’s what makes their bond feel so real. Oda was probably the only one who truly saw Dazai. Not as a weapon, not as some genius — just as a person who’s tired of himself.

And Dazai at 15? That wasn’t just a phase — that was already someone way too old for his age. Brilliant, cold, broken. Even back then, he hid all that emptiness behind sarcasm and a blank stare. Like he’d already seen too much

Life gets busy. But it’d be great to find something that flows. Something genuine, and maybe even something we actually look forward to. Sadly rare these days, I feel.



I’m a massive reader, mostly fiction, especially after work when I just wanna switch off and drift into another world. I keep meaning to get back into reading history, but I’ve been saying that for ages now. Still waiting on it to happen. 😀 Thankfully, Sabaton, who I’m seeing later this year, is keeping my love for history alive and kicking. That gig’s going to be an amazing experience. If you’re into unique genre interpretations, interested in history, or just like great music, I’d thoroughly recommend them.



Currently reading something fun which I probably shouldn’t admit to enjoying as much as I am. If you’re curious, feel free to ask. I might tell you, if you ask nicely. Or take a guess if you’re feeling bold. Got one of your own? Book, film, playlist?



When I’m not buried in a book, I’m usually out running. I got into it pretty impulsively and now I seem to have joined the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. My feed is mostly race clips, questionable running tips, and scenic routes I’d love to try, ideally ones that end with good coffee. A good coffee or pub is definitely a part of the running cult I’m more than happy to enjoy.



As a self-confessed running cult member, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you a part of? 🤣



I’ve rambled on, but honestly, I love getting to know people. The small things, the deep things, the random in-between bits that make someone them. I genuinely enjoy listening and learning about people beyond the surface. That’s the kind of connection I’m most drawn to.



If you’re into books, running, voice notes, late-night tangents, the kind of chats that start off light and before you know it, end somewhere unexpectedly lovely, or you’re up for building a connection with someone equally invested in doing so, say hi. I’m always up for proper conversation, and hopefully sparks fly.



If you’ve got a book or series that will completely consume me, or running tips which don’t involve building a shoe rotation worth the moon, I’m all ears.



Wow, you made it to the end. Clearly we already have stamina in common. 🙂",1,1748419554.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1kxbkiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1kxbkiy/billionaire_alphas_99_deadly_games_novel_when/,"""Billionaire Alpha's 99 Deadly Games Novel""- When Aria Collins rushed to the healer den after hearing that her mate Alpha Lucas Thornwood had been attacked by rival wolves and was bleeding out,","Chapter 1

When Aria Collins rushed to the healer den after hearing that her mate Alpha Lucas Thornwood had been attacked by rival wolves and was bleeding out, she immediately donated a full liter of blood for him.  
  
His friends urged her to go home and rest, and she reluctantly agreed. But just as she reached the doorway, anxiety gripped her heart and pulled her back.  
  
Turning around, she witnessed the pack healer dumping all five bags of blood—her blood—straight into the garbage bin!  
  
At that moment, thunderous laughter erupted from a nearby room, so loud it could've shattered windows.  
  
""Your Sweet Luna, Aria Collins fell for our bullshit again!"" a voice howled. ""What a fucking idiot!""  
  
Aria froze, staring through the half-open door. Among the crowd, she immediately spotted him.  
  
Lucas was lounging casually against the headboard, scrolling through his iPhone, barely paying attention to his friends. Though his face was partially blocked, she could still make out his chiseled jawline and perfect features—  
  
He didn't have a single scratch on him!  
  
Aria blinked hard, convinced her distress was making her hallucinate.  
  
""Guys, let's count,"" drawled one guy she recognized as Tyler, Lucas's closed friend. ""How many times have we screwed with her now?""  
  
""The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another alpha's son from Lucas's circle, ""we told her Lucas lost the silver moon pendant he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire night searching in a blizzard. Even with a 104-degree fever, the dumb bitch wouldn't quit.""  
  
""Remember the second time?"" Derek, Lucas's another friend, leaned forward eagerly. ""We convinced her Lucas was in a coma after a territory fight. She spent all night at the sacred grove lighting candles and sobbing to the pack elders. Got blessed water and a moonstone. Lucas poured the water out casually and gifted the moonstone to Leila Blackwood the next day!""  
  
""My personal favorite,"" smirked Josh, ""was when we framed her for challenging the lycan king's mate and nearly got her a rogue. The way she begged the pack council—pathetic! Still makes me laugh thinking about it.""  
  
""This blood donation scam makes ninety-six,"" Tyler calculated, checking something on his phone. ""Just three more pranks, and our revenge tour wraps up. Not bad for four years of entertainment. Worth every minute, right, Lucas?""  
  
Lucas barely looked up from his phone, his voice detached and bored. ""Whatever. As long as I can finally reject her and banish her from the pack after we hit ninety-nine.""  
  
""It's what she deserves,"" Blake insisted. ""Remember how she beat Leila for that position as ceremonial dancer? Leila cried for days. Nobody messes with your beloved and gets away with it.""  
  
""That's why it's been so perfect,"" Derek added. ""Pretending to accept her as your future Luna just to systematically destroy her? Pure genius, man. Too bad it's almost over. We'll need to find someone else to torture soon.""  
  
A deafening ringing filled Aria's ears, like a bomb had detonated inside her head.  
  
Her chest constricted so violently she thought she might be having a heart attack. She clutched at her sternum, doubling over to gasp for air, her lungs burning as though filled with acid.  
  
The words kept replaying in her mind like a nightmarish loop. Lucas was only mating with her for revenge. Four years of what she thought was love—just an elaborate scheme to break her.  
  
He knew exactly how desperately she loved him...  
  
Lucas Thornwood, the Alpha of The Thornwood Pack. With his predatory good looks, he could've stepped off a GQ billboard. ""One look at Lucas Thornwood and you're ruined for all other wolves""—that's what everyone said.  
  
And like a moth to flame, she'd fallen just like all the rest.  
  
Since the day she found out he was her mate, she had chased him relentlessly for three years, sacrificing every shred of her dignity, while he remained coldly indifferent—until one day, when he miraculously accepted her as his mate.  
  
She thought her persistence had finally melted his heart. Instead, it had all been a calculated game of destruction.  
  
The truth crushed her: he'd initially rejected her because his heart belonged to someone else.  
  
He only agreed to accept her later because she had beaten Leila Blackwood in that crucial moon dance competition and made his precious beloved cry.  
  
For revenge, he pretended to accept her, orchestrating ninety-nine humiliations to systematically destroy her soul piece by piece.  
  
Aria's tears streamed down uncontrollably, her throat constricting as if invisible hands were choking her.  
  
She stared at the group laughing without restraint, at Lucas's indifferent face, and suddenly felt hollowed out completely.  
  
She had given him everything—her love, her trust, her very being—only for him to crush it all beneath his Italian leather shoes and toss it away like yesterday's garbage.  
  
Just then, Josh noticed movement at the door and glanced over.  
  
Aria spun around and fled.  
  
She walked faster and faster until she was sprinting down the pack compound corridors, past startled pack members and guards.  
  
She had no destination—she just needed to escape this place, escape Lucas, escape the smoking ruins of her reality.  
  
When her legs finally gave out in some distant corner of the pack garden, she collapsed onto a bench as tears flooded from her eyes like a broken dam.  
  
She covered her face with trembling hands, her body convulsing with silent sobs that tore through her like physical pain. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.  
  
God, Aria, you pathetic, gullible fool.  
  
After what seemed like hours, her mother's gentle voice reached her through the mindlink.  
  
""Aria, sweetheart, your father and I are finalizing our arrangements to move to the Northern Alpine Pack in the Northern Territory next week. The High Alpha Council has requested him to lead their howl choir before the next full moon ceremony. Are you absolutely certain you don't want to join us? They has excellent moonlight dance instructors too.""  
  
Her father, a celebrated historian of werewolf traditions, had received this prestigious appointment months ago. They had planned to relocate as a family, but Aria had delayed and made excuses repeatedly, unable to bear leaving Lucas. She'd even considered staying with The Thornwood Pack permanently, transferring her allegiance just to be near him.  
  
Now, the irony of it all cut deeper than any silver blade could.  
  
""No,"" she wiped away her tears with such force it hurt her skin. She took a deep, shuddering breath. Her voice emerged raw but unwavering, ""Mom, Dad, I'm coming with you to the Northern Alpine Pack.""  
  


Chapter 2

Her mother's excited voice immediately came through the mindlink: ""That's fantastic, sweetheart! We'll start the pack transfer ritual right away—once it's done, there's no turning back. It's a point of no return.""  
  
Her fingertips trembling, but her voice remained unshakeable: ""I won't change my mind.""  
  
Her mother was about to end the mind-link but hesitated, cautiously asking: ""What about that alpha mate of yours? Didn't you chase after him forever? I thought you were head over heels for him.""  
  
The word ""mate"" felt like a knife twisting in her chest.  
  
Aria's mind instantly flashed back to the healer's room—the cruel laughter, Lucas sprawled carelessly on the bed scrolling through social media, his friends' vicious mockery, and the devastating realization that he'd wasted three years pretending to accept her solely to execute some twisted revenge plan for Leila Blackwood.  
  
Her heart constricted so violently she could barely breathe, like someone had reached into her chest and was squeezing it with bare hands.  
  
""I'm done with him,"" she heard herself say, her voice raw but eerily steady. ""Completely done. Forever.""  
  
After the mind-link, Aria stood motionless on the sidewalk, letting the bitter wind whip through her hair. She stared up at the bleak gray sky, drew in a deep breath that burned her lungs, and turned toward what she had foolishly called ""home.""  
  
The moment she pushed open the door, the familiar scent punched her in the gut.  
  
Aria froze in the entryway, staring at the living room she knew so well, feeling like she was trapped in someone else's nightmare.  
  
This was Lucas's den—the one he'd casually invited her to share after accepting her.  
  
That day, he had leaned against the doorframe with that trademark smirk and shrugged: ""Wanna move in?""  
  
Back then, she'd blushed like an idiot, heart soaring with joy, believing it was the beginning of their bond rather than what it actually was—convenient access for his ongoing psychological torture campaign.  
  
She had spent countless nights lying beside him, dreaming about their future mating ceremony, picturing their cubs running around, fantasizing about growing old together in this space.  
  
Now those memories were like wolfsbane in her veins.  
  
Moving in together? Just another calculated move to maximize her pain when the final blow came.  
  
She couldn't comprehend the depths of his obsession with Leila—to waste three years of his life with someone he despised, to let her sleep in his den, to run with her during full moons night after night...  
  
All to build the perfect illusion before destroying her completely.  
  
For the next three days, Aria didn't contact Lucas.  
  
She locked herself in the den and systematically purged every trace of him from her life.  
  
She found the journal where she'd documented her pathetic crush—a thick, worn notebook with every page filled with lovestruck ramblings.  
  
""OMG saw Lucas in the pack borders today!!! Charcoal V-neck + those black jeans = DYING. Had to pretend to patrol because I couldn't stop staring!""  
  
""HE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME TODAY!!! Just asked me to pass his coffee but I swear our fingers touched and there was a MOMENT. Haven't washed my hand yet lol.""  
  
""I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. He said YES. ME. Lucas Thornwood is letting ME into his pack. Is this real life?? I'm literally shaking writing this!!!""  
  
Aria flipped through page after cringe-worthy page, tears streaming down her face, each drop burning like fire.  
  
She threw the journal into a garbage bag with such force it tore through the plastic, her hands shaking with anger—at him, but mostly at herself.  
  
Next came the gifts she'd spent thousands on—  
  
The silver wolf pendant she'd saved three months for. The limited-edition ceremonial knife she'd stood in line overnight to purchase. The leather jacket that cost more than her rent. Each item representing months of sacrifice and planning on her part, probably tossed in a drawer and forgotten on his.  
  
Finally, the dozens of photos she'd secretly taken and printed of him.  
  
Pictures of Lucas giving speeches at pack gatherings, dominating the training grounds, holding court in hallways surrounded by admirers—each one had once made her heart flutter like a trapped bird.  
  
She dumped everything into the trash, methodically erasing every physical reminder of her former delusion.  
  
By the evening of the third day, Aria had finally purged the last item.  
  
Standing in the center of the now-barren living room, she felt a strange lightness wash over her, like shedding a skin that had grown too tight.  
  
Just then, the front door swung open and Lucas walked in.  
  
His eyes narrowed as he surveyed the noticeably emptier space. ""What the hell did you throw out?"" His tone was sharp, demanding.  
  
Aria looked up, meeting his gaze without flinching: ""Nothing important. Just garbage I should've gotten rid of years ago.""  
  
Lucas stepped closer, irritation evident in his voice: ""I was at the pack healer's after a serious territory dispute. Where were you?""  
  
Aria's lips curved into a hollow smile, her voice ice-cold: ""You're walking around just fine, aren't you? Guess it wasn't that serious after all.""  
  
Lucas froze, clearly caught off guard by her tone. He recovered quickly, softening his approach: ""I heard you donated blood for me. I was worried about you, so I came to check.""  
  
His gaze dropped to her arm, his voice dropping to that seductive murmur she once found irresistible: ""Are you in pain?""  
  
Aria pulled her arm away like his gaze might contaminate her. ""No,"" she said flatly, as if speaking to a stranger.  
  
Lucas's brow furrowed deeply, clearly unsettled by this new version of her: ""What the fuck happened while I was gone? You're like a completely different person.""  
  
Aria's lips twitched into a smile that didn't reach her eyes: ""Different? How so?""  
  
Lucas didn't answer, but they both knew exactly what had changed.  
  
The old Aria had looked at him like he hung the moon and stars. She'd once spent three straight nights by his bedside when he had a common cold, checking his temperature every hour, making homemade soup, practically worshipping at the altar of his minor discomfort.  
  
Yet now, after what was supposed to be a life-threatening injury, she hadn't even bothered to call.  
  
Lucas's intense gaze searched her face, hunting for some clue to this sudden transformation.  
  
His voice dropped to that practiced, intimate tone he used when he wanted something: ""You seem stressed. My friends are throwing me a welcome-back rager tonight. Come with me?""  
  


Chapter 3

Before Aria could refuse, Lucas had already grabbed her wrist and practically dragged her to his Range Rover.  
  
The car pulled up outside The Night, the territory's most exclusive alphas-only club for elite werewolves. After parking, Lucas circled around to her side and opened the door with a theatrical flourish that once would have made her heart flutter.  
  
Aria gave him a flat, empty stare as she stepped out.  
  
The moment they entered the dimly lit space, Aria's attention was immediately drawn to a familiar figure.  
  
Leila Blackwood.  
  
She wore a champagne silk slip dress with a dangerously high slit, designer heels, and just enough silver to look effortless. Her glossy hair fell in loose waves, and her calculated smile drew everyone in as she held court in the VIP section, cocktail in hand.  
  
Leila had been Lucas's childhood friend. During the years Aria had mated with Lucas, the two women had never crossed paths.  
  
So she'd never suspected that Lucas had been obsessed with Leila all along.  
  
When Leila spotted them, her eyes flickered with recognition, then narrowed into the slightest smirk—a look that confirmed everything. She'd been in on the 99-part revenge scheme all along.  
  
This is revenge #97, Aria realized with stomach-turning clarity. Coming here was a setup.  
  
Lucas also noticed Leila's presence. His fingers tensed around Aria's before he abruptly dropped her hand like it had burned him.  
  
He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear: ""Gotta take this call. Network with packmates or whatever. Back in five.""  
  
Aria stood frozen, watching Lucas's retreating figure, a cold emptiness spreading through her chest. The casualness of his dismissal felt like another slap in the face.  
  
Before she could react, Leila was already gliding across the room with runway precision, following directly in Lucas's wake.  
  
Their silhouettes—one leading, one following—disappeared around a corner, no doubt heading somewhere private.  
  
Aria had no time to dwell on what they might be doing together, as Lucas's friends quickly surrounded her.  
  
""Well, if it isn't Lucas's favorite charity case!"" Tyler's voice boomed as he shoved a glass of something amber-colored into her hand.  
  
Aria shook her head firmly. ""I don't drink.""  
  
""Don't be such a fucking buzzkill,"" Blake sneered. ""What's wrong, afraid Lucas will get mad?"" They all laughed, exchanging knowing glances.  
  
""Or maybe she can't handle her liquor,"" Derek added, pushing the glass toward her lips. ""Little Miss Perfect probably gets wasted off one shot.""  
  
Aria tried to step back, but Josh blocked her path. ""Either drink it or wear it, sweetheart.""  
  
When she tried to break free, Tyler gave her a hard shove. ""Oops, my bad.""  
  
""Ah—!""  
  
She cried out as she lost her balance and fell straight into the adjacent infinity pool.  
  
The freezing water engulfed her instantly.  
  
She couldn't swim. Her limbs flailed desperately, but her clothes quickly became waterlogged, dragging her down.  
  
Water rushed into her nose and mouth, burning her lungs. The club lights above the surface blurred and distorted as her consciousness began to fade, darkness closing in until everything went black.  
  
...  
  
When Aria next opened her eyes, she found herself back in the bedroom of Lucas's den. Her head pounded with each heartbeat, and her body burned as if she were being roasted alive.  
  
She struggled to focus her vision and saw Lucas sitting by the bed, holding a glass of water and some pills.  
  
""You're burning up. Take these,"" Lucas said, his voice soft with what might have seemed like concern—if she didn't know better now.  
  
Aria hazily accepted the pills and swallowed them with the water.  
  
Too weak to think clearly, she only registered that her throat felt like she'd swallowed glass and her body seemed to have turned to concrete.  
  
She closed her eyes, wanting to escape back into unconsciousness, but her temperature kept climbing, something scorching through her veins.  
  
Some time later—minutes or hours, she couldn't tell—she forced her eyes open again and realized Lucas was gone.  
  
Of course, she thought bitterly. He can't even be bothered to maintain the charade anymore.  
  
She struggled to sit up, touching her forehead. It was terrifyingly hot.  
  
She knew she couldn't wait any longer. She needed medical help.  
  
With trembling fingers, she ordered an Uber to the nearest ER out of the pack.  
  
Aria dragged her leaden body through the hospital doors, barely making it to the reception desk before a nurse rushed to help her.  
  
The doctor immediately put her on an IV drip, which finally brought her fever down slightly.  
  
After examining her thoroughly, the doctor frowned: ""Ms. Collins, your temperature was 104.3 when you came in. You're bordering on pneumonia from aspiration. Why didn't you come in sooner?""  
  
Aria leaned weakly against the hospital bed, her voice barely audible: ""I thought the medicine would help.""  
  
The doctor looked concerned. ""What medicine were you taking?""  
  
Aria pulled a small bottle from her pocket and handed it to the doctor. ""Fever reducers. My mate gave it to me.""  
  
The doctor opened the bottle, examined its contents, and his expression darkened: ""These aren't medication at all. The bottle is labeled correctly, but these are nothing but sugar pills. Taking these instead of actual medication could have been extremely dangerous in your condition.""  
  
Aria's heart plummeted, her fingers trembling slightly.  
  
Suddenly, her phone buzzed repeatedly.  
  
She weakly raised her hand to check it. A series of WhatsApp notifications lit up her screen.  
  
They were from a group chat with Lucas's friends.  
  
Tyler: Revenge #97 = EPIC WIN!!!  
  
Blake: Whoever came up with the pool + fake meds combo deserves a fucking medal! First we ""accidentally"" push her in, then Lucas swoops in with sugar pills. She's gotta be DYING rn  
  
Josh: Lucas's face when she swallowed those pills tho  
  
Derek: HOLY SHIT DELETE THIS! WRONG GROUP! SHE CAN SEE THESE!!!

**Title: Beneath the Surface**

In a quaint suburban neighborhood, where white picket fences lined manicured lawns, lived Lila, a strikingly beautiful woman known for her intelligence and captivating charm. To outsiders, she seemed to lead a perfect life, dotted with academic accolades and a promising career. However, beneath her polished exterior lay a labyrinth of emotional detachment and a chilling complexity that few could perceive.

Lila's world was meticulously curated, a series of carefully controlled interactions where she felt safe from vulnerability. This was where she thrived: in the shadows of people's perceptions, utilizing her keen understanding of others' emotions while remaining emotionally distant herself. Dismissive and avoidant, she had always shunned intimacy, but she found excitement in the chase of relationships, only to discard them when they required too much of her.

Enter Eric, a gentle soul with an unwavering optimism that was both endearing and unsettling to Lila. He was the antithesis of her stoic demeanor, bringing a warmth that Lila found intriguing at first. They met in a coffee shop, where their conversations wove together effortlessly, sparking an instant, albeit superficial, connection. Eric's charm buried the knife of ambition deep within her, and the slow burn of his affection awakened a thrill Lila had long forgotten.

At first, she engaged with Eric, reveling in the simplicity of his love. However, as their relationship progressed, Lila’s inner turmoil began to surface. Unable to handle the depth of his feelings, she resorted to her age-old tactics—creating emotional distance while meticulously dismantling his self-worth. In her mind, it was a game.

Lila began to subtly manipulate Eric's emotions, critiquing his ambitions and expressing disinterest in his passions. ""You really think that's a valuable career choice?"" she'd laugh lightly, the smile on her face not reaching her eyes. Each statement was laced with a concealed venom, designed to make him second-guess himself.

As weeks turned into months, Eric's confidence waned. He found himself walking on eggshells, desperate to win back the affection and adoration that once came so easily. Lila would withdraw for days, leaving him in a state of uncertainty, only to return, charming and affectionate, effectively flipping the switch on his emotions. The clockwork of their relationship ticked to a rhythm only she could play.

Lila's dismissive nature morphed into calculated cruelty disguised as indifference. She would challenge his love, posing questions like, ""What do you even see in me?"" and when the tenderness in his eyes faltered, she'd retract her affection entirely. ""Maybe I need someone who's more passionate,"" she would casually suggest, casting a shadow of despair over Eric’s spirit.

With each interaction, she buried him deeper, meticulously shaping the narrative that painted him as inadequate. She thrived on the power she wielded, feeding off his confusion and heartbreak as he spiraled deeper into despair. It was as if she were an artist, crafting a masterpiece of destruction as Eric's vibrant colors faded to gray.

In her quest to remain emotionally unscathed, Lila had become a puppet master, drawing his strings tighter until, finally, they snapped. The day came when Eric stood before her, tears brimming in his eyes and his voice trembling. ""I don't even recognize myself anymore. What happened to us?"" 

For the first time, Lila felt a flicker of something unfamiliar—guilt, perhaps—but her walls held firm. Rather than confront her role in his suffering, she deflected with a piercing gaze. ""Maybe you're the problem, Eric."" And like a skilled conductor, she turned away, ending the symphony of their relationship with chilling finality.

As Eric walked away, fractured and diminished, Lila felt a fleeting sense of triumph. Yet, somewhere deep inside, a silence grew—a void amplifying the echoes of her choices. She had built her fortress on the ruins of another’s spirit, but within the walls of her emotional castle, there was no one to celebrate her victories. Alone, she reveled in her calculated detachment while simultaneously spiraling into the depths of her own existential loneliness.

The cycle of relationships continued, but Lila would always be haunted by the specter of Eric, the boy who had loved her fiercely, who had unmasked the emotions she feared most. Beneath her polished exterior, where shadows danced with deception, she realized the profound truth: even chaos craved connection, and her victories were as hollow as the love she had chosen to forsake.",1,1748419054.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

1. Must be within max 45 mins commute from the University.
2. Access to markets/supermarkets nearby.
3. Rent budget is 15K and deposit not more than 50k.

I have been looking at places around Yelahanka, Hebbal and Manyata Tech Park because that's all my amateur fact-finding suggested were good places. Suggestions of other locations or any good leads at all will be extremely appreciated. I will owe you at the very least a coffee.

She's carried a lot of the trauma from her childhood and I believe it's responsible for how she is now.

But all my life I have felt trapped at home, constantly in awe of other people that have nice, caring, affectionate Mothers. I never know who I'm going to get every day, whether she's going to be in a good mood, or bad mood.

When I was younger she was physically abusive, I was hit and occasionally beaten for
""back chatting"" or being rude, etc, but the physical abuse died out as I got older and I don't think l've been hit for many years now.

Today's episode of her being emotionally, verbally and racially abusive (she's a white woman and my dad is black, so l'm mixed):
I came downstairs and told her about how much pain I was in due to my toothache and I woke up in the middle of the night and there was no coffee mugs in the cupboard so I just used a glass and filled it with luke warm tap water and salt to do a rinse, and she said yeah because all of the mugs are in your room. I said there's one mug in my room and one in the bathroom, and the rest were in the sink, and she said well I didn't put them there (I had one mug with flu medicine in it and one with salt water in the bathroom) there's like 10 mugs, and all of them were in the sink when I came downstairs in the middle of the night and I only used 2 which were upstairs.

She then proceeded to gaslight me that there was no mugs in the cupboard because they were all upstairs or used by me? I corrected her, but in the beginning I was just talking about it casually/jokingly to tell her how my night went. It then escalated to her telling me how I contradict her, how she hates me, how she wants me to drop dead, how I'm a nigger bitch and she wants me out of her house, that if her throat flares up from shouting at me I will be dead at the end of the day.

I feel so trapped, this happens about once a week, her snapping at me like this, and I cry about it, bite it down, act like nothing happens, I get no apology.

I'm stuck and want out but I'm also emotionally dependent on my Mom, because I have chronic anxiety that has developed tremendously over the years. I have no independence. From the age of 18 she told me I couldn't work otherwise she would loose her benefits and l'd have to pay for everything, I've never had a job. I only discovered what she said wasn't true recently and now I'm not mentally well enough to hold down a job. I can't turn to the government because I've been selling feet pictures (pls I know that's kinda funny but this is still a serious situation LOL) and I haven't been announcing my income which I also had no idea I had to do up until recently, no matter how small or large it is, because she's never had a job the entirety of my life and she's never taught me anything valuable and now I'm scared to turn to the government for help because I don't want to get in trouble.

I feel like I've been made incompetent and dependent on her and I have no idea what to do to get out.

She might not hit me anymore but the mental damage is real, she's even gone as far to run at me with knife's and stab the door I'm on the other end of. My door had to be changed, the toilet door had to be changed, both doors I've locked myself on the other side of. There's stab marks in the walls of the hall ways. She's turned off the power in the middle of the night and started screaming before. She's insane and I'm trapped.

What do I do?

TL;DR:

Mom used to be physically abusive, now just emotionally and racially (white woman, mixed daughter). I feel like l've been made incompetent and emotionally reliant on her. I have no work/life experience, scared to turn to the government because NSFW work and I didn't realise I had to announce incomes even if I earned less than tax bracket. I'm mentally not in a great place right now. Need advice or someone that can at least relate?

## What is Zyvexor Rise AI?

Zyvexor Rise AI is an **automated trading platform** powered by artificial intelligence. Think of it as your digital trading assistant that never sleeps. It analyzes market data in real-time, identifies potential trading opportunities, and can automatically execute trades on your behalf.

It’s designed for both beginners who don’t know a candlestick from a matchstick and seasoned traders who just want to reduce the emotional baggage of manual trading. The platform claims to have a high win rate by leveraging **machine learning algorithms** and predictive analytics. Whether that holds true or not depends on market conditions, your trading settings, and a little bit of luck.

## Who Created Zyvexor Rise AI?

Here’s where things get a bit mysterious. Like a lot of platforms in this space, the creators of Zyvexor Rise AI prefer to stay behind the curtain. There's no Elon Musk-style face of the operation. However, based on my research and comparison with similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge, it seems Zyvexor Rise AI was developed by a group of fintech and AI experts who’ve previously worked on other trading bots.

They also appear to partner with **regulated brokers**, which is a good sign. It’s not some random Telegram group launching a pump-and-dump bot. But yeah, I’d love to see more transparency from them in the future — even just a LinkedIn page or two would go a long way.

## How Does Zyvexor Rise AI Work?

Zyvexor Rise AI uses **real-time data analysis** combined with machine learning to identify trading opportunities across multiple financial markets. It looks at things like price patterns, volume shifts, news sentiment, and technical indicators. Once it finds a pattern it’s been trained to recognize as profitable, it either alerts you or executes the trade automatically — depending on your settings.

Here’s the simplified version:
- **Input:** Real-time market data
- **Processing:** AI algorithms analyze trends and signals
- **Output:** Trade recommendations or auto-trades

It’s kind of like having a robot that doesn’t get tired, doesn’t panic-sell, and doesn’t YOLO your savings into Dogecoin. Just remember, **AI isn’t magic** — it’s still bound by the quality of data it receives and unpredictable market events.

## Zyvexor Rise AI Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect, and Zyvexor Rise AI has its ups and downs.

**Pros:**
- ✅ **AI-Powered Trading**: Automates trades using real-time data and historical trends.
- ✅ **Beginner-Friendly UI**: Clean, simple interface — no trading degree required.
- ✅ **Asset Variety**: Crypto, forex, stocks, even commodities like gold.
- ✅ **Custom Alerts**: You control how much (or little) the AI does.
- ✅ **Demo Mode Available**: Try before you commit real funds.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **No Mobile App (yet)**: Mobile browser works fine, but a native app would be better.
- ❌ **Anonymous Creators**: Would like more transparency on who’s behind it.
- ❌ **Risk Still Exists**: No AI can guarantee profits — losses happen.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Zyvexor Rise AI?

No need to dust off your old Dell Inspiron — Zyvexor Rise AI works on pretty much anything with a browser. Whether you’re on a **laptop, desktop, tablet, or smartphone**, the platform adjusts to your screen size and runs smoothly.

It’s optimized for mobile browsers, so even though there’s no standalone app (yet), you can still track trades and make adjustments on the go. I used it on both my MacBook and Android phone without any issues.

## Zyvexor Rise AI – Supported Countries

Zyvexor Rise AI is available in most countries where online trading is allowed. I tested it while traveling through the **U.S., Germany, and Singapore** — no problems logging in or accessing features.

However, like many platforms, it’s **not available in restricted regions** like North Korea, Iran, or countries under strict financial sanctions. Also, some countries may have additional KYC requirements depending on local laws.

If you're unsure, try signing up with just your email to see if your country is accepted. No harm in checking.

## Zyvexor Rise AI – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where the AI shines. Zyvexor Rise AI continuously scans global markets using advanced algorithms that can process **thousands of data points per second**. It reacts to trends faster than any human could, which makes it ideal for catching those early entry points before the crowd does.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded before, you won’t feel overwhelmed. The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and color-coded. You can toggle from automatic to manual trading, set your risk levels, and access tutorials right from the control panel.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no downloadable app, the browser version works flawlessly on mobile. I placed a few trades while waiting in line for coffee, and everything loaded quickly. So yeah, it’s mobile-friendly enough for real-life use.

### Customizable Alerts

One of my favorite features — you can set custom triggers for price changes, trade signals, or even news events. This means you're always in the loop without being glued to your screen. Great for part-time traders or anyone with a day job.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Zyvexor Rise AI isn’t just crypto. You can also trade **forex pairs, U.S. stocks, gold, oil**, and more. It’s nice to have that diversity, especially when crypto is doing its usual rollercoaster thing.

## Is Zyvexor Rise AI a Scam?

Short answer: **Doesn’t seem like it.**

Longer answer: I didn’t find any red flags like fake testimonials, hard-to-find withdrawal options, or shady affiliate schemes. The platform is partnered with **regulated brokers**, and withdrawals (in my experience) processed in under 48 hours. That’s better than many competitors.

That said, always proceed with caution. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and test the waters with the demo mode and minimum deposit first.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Zyvexor Rise AI?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. It gives you enough capital to start trading without risking too much upfront.

Once you deposit, you can use demo mode or go straight into live trading. I recommend demo mode first — get a feel for the AI’s behavior before putting real money on the line.

### Zyvexor Rise AI Customer Support

Support is available via **live chat and email**, and in my tests, they responded within an hour. Pretty solid response time. They also have a decent FAQ section and some tutorials built into the dashboard.

Would love to see 24/7 support or phone-based help in the future, though.

## How do you start trading on Zyvexor Rise AI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to the official site and enter your name, email, and phone number. It takes less than 2 minutes. You’ll be matched with a broker right after.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll need to go through a basic **KYC process** — upload an ID and proof of address. Then deposit at least $250 via card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can use demo mode to test strategies or dive into live trading. Customize your risk settings, choose assets, and let the AI handle the rest.

## How to Delete a Zyvexor Rise AI Account?

To delete your account, you’ll need to contact customer support. It’s not a one-click process, but they’ll guide you through it. Make sure to withdraw any remaining funds before initiating the deletion.

Zyvexor Rise AI is a **solid choice** for anyone looking to get into AI-driven trading without needing a PhD in finance. It’s intuitive, flexible, and packed with useful features.

\- Starting weight = 150kg.  Weight today = 138.2kg

So have managed 11.8kg in the month.

 I have never cheated and eaten anything during the fast period and have limited drinks to water and black coffee.  Most days I have focused on eating very sensibly, limiting portion sizes and carb intake, and mostly avoiding anything sweet.  When I have had carb heavy meals or desserts I found that my weight loss faltered, or I put some weight back on.  This was quite frustrating and the 'eat anything as long as only in the 1 hour' does not seem to work for me.  Most days I go for a walk lasting between 30 minutes and 1 hour.

Overall it has been great with such positive effects.  Whilst I expect the weight loss to slow down I have learned that coupling it with very sensible eating is the only way it works for me.  Exercising is getting easier as I get lighter.  If I can get motivated to do more of this I know it will help.

For anyone looking to start I would definitely recommend trying it.  It has given me fast and noticeable benefits which help with keeping motivation.  For now I will keep it up and will let you know how it is going after I have finished the second month.",1,1748418164.0,omad,0,1.0,False

Anelise needed air. She excused herself from the table and walked to the patio of the little Parisian coffee and wine bar, the cool night air caressing her heated skin. Her slinky silk dress didn’t cover up much, but she still felt like she was going to melt into a puddle if she sat next to Michael a minute longer.



She took a deep breath and gazed out at the glittering skyline, the Eiffel Tower standing like a proud beauty amidst the other architecture. Maybe love really was in the air in this city. 



Or maybe it was just the wine she’d had. Or they way Michael’s big, warm hand had rested on her thigh under the table. She’d found herself biting her lip, wishing his fingers would inch just a little higher.



But no, she couldn’t lose her head tonight. It was all just an act. Michael just needed a plus-one to show off to his high-class colleagues, and as his nanny, Anelise was the easiest option available. After tonight, this delicious dream would be over, and the two of them would go back to the way things were.



Anelise tried to tell herself that was for the best. But then she felt a familiar warm body brush up beside her at the railing, and she lost all her resolve.



“Something wrong?” Michael asked in his husky baritone.



She looked up into his clear green eyes and suddenly found her own filling with tears. Concern etched itself into his handsome face and he lifted a hand to her face, brushing away a traitorous tear with his thumb. 



“None of this is real,” she whispered, afraid to break the spell.



His eyes dipped to her lips and he leaned in closer. “Do you want it to be real?” he asked.



Anelise’s head spun. He was too close. She’d had too much to drink. The flowers in full bloom all around the patio filled the air with a sweetness that made her dizzy. 



She knew it wasn’t the smart answer. But when she opened her mouth, all she could say was, “Yes.”



Then Michael’s mouth was on hers, and she didn’t need to worry about what to say anymore. Maybe tomorrow, she would wake up back in reality where he was her employer and she was his nanny. But tonight, she would enjoy the dream that they belonged together.



\*\*\*



“You’ve got to be kidding me, Kathy,” said Michael in disbelief, completely thrown off kilter.



“I’m so sorry, Michael. But I’m already in Vegas with Shawn. After we tie the knot, we’re going on a long honeymoon,” Kathy replied.



“We’re leaving in two weeks!” Michael winced at his tone and lowered his voice. Kathy was adamant about never yelling at his kid, so he figured he owed her the same courtesy. “What am I going to do without a nanny?” 



“I regret leaving on such short notice, but you’ll have to find someone else. When it’s love, it’s love. You understand, don’t you?”



“Yeah, sure,” Michael grumbled. He didn’t, really. 



“Can you say goodbye to Ollie for me?” she asked softly.



“I will. He’ll miss you,” he said before hanging up. Then he threw the phone on the table, cursing, “Son of a bitch!”



“What’s wrong, Michael?” Kim inquired. Kathy had called him in the middle of lunch with his neighbors, the Morgans.



“Oh, nothing, just my nanny quitting on me!” he fumed as he leaned back in the chair, running his fingers through his hair.



“Kathy just up and quit right before your big trip?” Neil asked, leading a cherubic little boy to the table with a sippy cup of milk.



Michael definitely had to mind his tone in front of his son. “She’s in Vegas, eloping,” he gritted out.



“Wow,” Kim said. “I never knew she was such a romantic.”



Romance caused more problems than it was worth in Michael’s opinion. Not that he ever regretted Ollie, but his mother… There were a lot of regrets there. 



“I just had a thought,” said Neil, squeezing his wife’s hand. “What about our daughter, Anelise? She’s almost done with her semester and loves to babysit.”



“Really?” Michael was willing to grasp at any glimmer of hope. “Do you think she would be interested in spending her summer nannying?”



“Oh, I think it would be perfect for her!” Kim enthused. “I’m sure she’d rather work for a trusted friend of the family than some summer job where they just want to take advantage of her.”



Neil nodded. “She’s a good girl, never gets in trouble, maintains a perfect 4.0 GPA. And she doesn’t party, even though she has a rowdy roommate. She’ll be a great influence on little Ollie,” he said, ruffling the kid’s hair.



“How old is she again?” Michael asked.



“She’ll be turning twenty-one in October,” Kim beamed.



Michael didn’t hate the idea. She really did sound like a good kid. “Well, may I have her number? I’ll give her a call and see what she thinks.”



“Of course. I’ll text her to give her a heads-up,” said Neil.



Michael glanced at the pictures of the neighbors’ daughter on the walls. She was a chubby young woman with glasses, dark auburn hair, and a nice smile. She looked like an archetypal bookworm, every bit as responsible as her parents claimed.



\*\*\*



Anelise was making notes for the thesis proposal that she would be writing over the summer. She had to turn it in after the final, but she just wasn’t pleased with it. She wanted something more, but didn’t know what.



When she was discussing her proposal with Professor Andrews, she had felt it was lacking something, some excitement or passion, some spark that ignited her soul.



Professor Andrews, on the other hand, said what she had would make a good final project. But Anelise didn’t want just good; she wanted her thesis to be great.



Anelise sighed as she went to get a cup of sweet tea, which she allowed herself to have once a day. She believed that if she didn’t limit herself, the weight loss she had worked so hard for would go down the drain.



She took a long sip, feeling thankful that her roommate and best friend, Leslie, was out having Sunday brunch with her ridiculously wealthy family and the apartment was quiet so she could stew in peace.



She was walking around her room, trying to clear her head to study for the rest of her finals, when her phone rang.



Without recognizing the number, but seeing the Chicago area code, she figured it could be the neighbor that her parents had said might call with an interesting proposal.



“Hello?” she answered.



“Hello. Is this Anelise?” asked the caller in a deep baritone. Her name in that voice sent goosebumps tingling all over her body. She shook herself out of it. The stress of finals must be getting to her.



“Yes, this is Anelise. How can I help you?”



“My name is Michael Whitlock. Your parents gave me your number. I’m their neighbor,” he explained.



“Yes, they mentioned that you might be calling with a proposal. What can I do for you?”



“Well, I know this is completely out of left field, but I’m in one hell of a bind. Your parents mentioned that you like kids and have done some babysitting jobs before. My nanny quit yesterday. She’s eloping, if you can believe it.”



“That’s awfully romantic,” she said with a smile.



He sighed. “Very. The problem is, I’m leaving for three months for work and she was supposed to come with us and watch my son, Ollie. Is that something you might be interested in? I’ll pay you handsomely.""



She bit her lip, more money would be welcome. She had come to really enjoy shopping with Leslie since she had lost so much weight.



“Well, I’m not sure... I’m going to be writing my master’s thesis…”



“I know. Your parents told me. They said you might like to know we’d be in London for the summer. You would get days off to explore and do research for your paper.”



“Seriously?!” Analise took in a sharp breath.



“Yes, we’d leave in thirteen days, and I’d be paying you $1,500 per week. Food and accommodation would be covered by my company, of course. But I’ll be working a lot, and you’d be responsible for Ollie well into the nights.”



Having laid out the specifics, he hoped he had enticed her and not turned her off to the idea.



Being in London for three months? Earning a shit ton of money for watching one child? At that rate, Anelise would be making so much that she could quit the coffee shop and not return next semester. How could she refuse?



“Are you still there?” She heard him ask, before realizing how long she was taking to respond.



“Oh my gosh, I’m sorry! Yes, I’m still here, and yes, I’ll do it!” she replied excitedly.



“Really?!” Michael said, feeling a huge weight being lifted off his shoulders.



“Yes. I know it’s not ideal that I can’t meet you or your son before we go. But this sounds like a good arrangement for us both. And I could quit my current job with your generous offer,” she said, feeling giddy.



“Oh my God. Thank you! You’re a real lifesaver, Anelise!” He all but hollered into the phone, punching the air with his fist.

(Yes!),"Starting to plan for retirement at age 50 might seem daunting, but it's definitely achievable with the right strategies—and you're not alone in this journey. Imagine this: you’re sitting down with your morning coffee, looking ahead and realizing you’ve got half a decade left until the golden years. You're wondering if there’s still time to build up your retirement nest egg. The answer? Absolutely! In fact, many people have succeeded in securing their financial future this way. Let me introduce you to Mark and Eliza Thompson, a couple who faced similar challenges but managed to turn things around and retire comfortably by the time they were 65.

Meet Mark and Eliza Thompson
At 50, Mark and Eliza found themselves staring down some pretty hefty retirement goals—they wanted to maintain their current lifestyle after retirement. The first thing they did was conduct a thorough financial inventory. This helped them understand where they stood financially, what they could realistically afford, and what adjustments they needed to make. Armed with this knowledge, they set their sights on maximizing their retirement contributions. Every bit matters!

They also made smart investments, focusing on a mix of stocks and bonds that offered better returns over time, all while staying diversified to minimize risk. Eliza even downsized their home, selling their sprawling suburban house for a cozy condo closer to family, which cut down on monthly expenses like maintenance and utilities. These small steps added up to significant savings over the next few years. By making these strategic moves, Mark and Eliza found that reaching their financial goals was not as impossible as they initially thought.

Strategies for Retirement Success

So, how can you get on track if you’re aiming to start your retirement planning at 50? Here are some key steps:

### Conduct a Financial Inventory
Before you dive in, take stock of where you stand now. List out your current income streams, existing savings, and the state of your debts. Knowing these details will help you map out your path.

### Define Your Retirement Vision
What does retirement look like for you? Do you want to travel? Buy a vacation home? Or simply enjoy a slower pace of life? Setting clear goals will give you direction and motivation.

### Eliminate High-Interest Debt
Focus on paying off credit cards, loans, and other high-interest debts. The interest on these can eat away at your hard-earned savings and drag you back financially.

### Maximize Retirement Contributions
Max out your 401(k) or IRA contributions. If you’re 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions to help you save even more. Every dollar counts when you’re starting later.

### Invest for Growth
Diversify your investments into assets that can grow, such as equities and real estate. Even small amounts over time can compound into a substantial nest egg.

### Reduce Lifestyle Spending
Cut unnecessary expenses. Maybe you can skip that extra latté or postpone buying that new car. Small sacrifices today can lead to big rewards tomorrow.

### Extend Your Timeline
If 65 seems too ambitious, consider gradually extending your timeline. Phasing into retirement by working part-time can ease the transition while still allowing you to build your savings.

Embrace a Mindset Shift
Finally, focus on shifting your mindset from short-term gratification to long-term security. Prioritize saving over spending. Use every tool available—from retirement calculators to financial advisors—to stay on track.

### Conclusion
Starting your retirement planning at 50 is entirely possible with the right mindset, strategies, and tools. By conducting a financial inventory, setting clear goals, paying off debts, maximizing contributions, reducing spending, and being flexible about the timeline, you can reach your retirement vision. And remember, you're not in it alone—use the wealth of information and support available online, including forums like this one.

1kxb4ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1kxb4ht/solicitors_demanding_i_remove_negative_review_in/,Solicitors demanding I remove negative review in England,"My Mum nominated me to be her power of attorney with a sibling in 2023. Unfortunately, she was not aware she had to register it with OPG as she thought they had. She paid for this alongside a will. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with a terminal and very aggressive illness in March 2025. In April my sister and I found out the LPAs were not registered and could not be used. Registration would take 8 weeks which we did not have.
Mum remade her will in March 2025 and wanted me to be sole executor and joint trustee with my other sibling. When the will came they made a mistake and named us as joint executors. Older sibling and I do not get on so it complicates probate. Mum and I contacted them over the phone to correct the clause but they refused as they wanted to see her in person. When they visited Mum in April she had fluctuating capacity at best and they insisted on seeing her on her own. My mum was very anxious over this. They said she confirmed that clause and her will. At that stage Mum had difficulty making any decisions even over simple things such as tea or coffee.
I phoned solicitors but they blocked me and my sister. I could only get through using 141. They refused to confirm if I was executor and were rude. I left a negative but honest review on Trustpilot.
Mum passed last week and they called me stating they would send me April’s will if I removed review. I challenged the authenticity of April’s will as Mum lacked capacity and it was not witnessed. Yesterday, they said they have reverted to March’s will but will not change executor clause. Twice they have told me executor and trustee are the same. I stated they are distinct and Mum never intended for my older sister to be joint executor. They said they would write to her if I remove negative review.

Is it ethical and legal for them to act like this?

When you’re rich, you can pick up the phone, dial a number and get a banker, a doctor, a lawyer, or a politician to pick up the call on the first try. None of them seem to have secretaries or receptionists to get past. Phone calls never receive a busy signal.

There is always a parking space available right in front of the building, along a busy street, in the middle of an intersection, in a yellow zone. No matter where you’re going, there’s a parking space waiting when you arrive.

There’s always a table available in any restaurant you step into, even if you don’t have a reservation.

Everywhere you go, someone is there to offer you booze or coffee. Everywhere. You can have drink after drink without acting drunk, (unless being drunk furthers the plot), or multiple coffees without having a caffeine buzz.

Your hair never gets messed up, even if you get into a bar fight.

Your wallpaper is horrendous. Even at home. Your furniture is lovely, but the crap on the walls could gag a maggot. I guess it was “stylish” back in the early 80’s. Maybe.

Men still treat women like chattel and most of the time, they seem ok with it. The women try to be independent, but eventually, they get back under the thumb of some man. 

Kisses are awkward and NOT romantic, yet men seem to get any woman into bed with sweet talk and smiles.

Whether it’s sealed off, purely decorative, or simply out of season, your empty fireplace presents a unique design opportunity. With a little creativity, you can transform it into a stylish focal point that adds personality and warmth—even without a flame.

[https://jcdesignbuild.com/blog/empty-fireplace-ideas/](https://jcdesignbuild.com/blog/empty-fireplace-ideas/)

Here are 15 clever and charming ideas to breathe new life into an empty fireplace:

# 1. Stack It with Firewood

Even if you don’t light a fire, the look of stacked logs brings a rustic, cozy vibe. Use real or faux logs for a natural, earthy touch that nods to the fireplace’s original purpose.

# 2. Create a Candle Display

Cluster candles of various heights and sizes inside the fireplace for a romantic, flickering glow. Flameless LED candles are a safe alternative that still gives off a beautiful ambiance.

# 3. Add Built-In Shelving

Turn your firebox into a miniature bookcase or display shelf. It's perfect for showcasing books, plants, ceramics, or small collectibles.

# 4. Design a Mini Gallery

Use the fireplace cavity to display framed art, photography, or even a statement mirror. Layer frames for depth and a more curated feel.

# 5. Incorporate Seasonal Decor

Update the space with seasonal decorations—pumpkins in fall, evergreen branches in winter, fresh blooms in spring, and seashells in summer.

# 6. Install a Statement Screen

Even if you don’t use the fireplace, a decorative fireplace screen can add elegance and style. Look for a screen with intricate metalwork, glass, or unique patterns.

# 7. Display a Large Plant or Floral Arrangement

Bring life and color into the room with greenery. Tall potted plants, dried arrangements, or large vases filled with fresh or faux flowers can soften the hard lines of a fireplace.

# 8. Use It for Storage (Beautifully!)

Slide in a few woven baskets or decorative boxes to store blankets, games, or other living room essentials—practical and pretty.

# 9. Layer with Mirrors

Place a mirror or a series of small mirrors inside the firebox to reflect light and add depth. It can brighten the room and make the fireplace feel larger.

# 10. Go Vintage or Antique

Fill the opening with antique finds—weathered books, lanterns, vintage suitcases, or classic pottery. This adds charm and character, especially in eclectic or traditional homes.

# 11. Create a Kids' Reading Nook

Add a few cushions, a soft rug, and some stuffed animals or books to turn the space into a playful, cozy reading spot for little ones.

# 12. Install Tile or Wallpaper Inside

Enhance the firebox with peel-and-stick tiles or removable wallpaper for a bold surprise. Patterns and textures add visual interest to the otherwise dark cavity.

# 13. Go Minimalist

Sometimes less is more. Keep it simple with a single sculptural object—like a ceramic vase or a clean-lined lantern—for a modern, refined look.

# 14. Add Fairy Lights or String Lights

Wrap string lights around decorative logs or drape them inside the fireplace for a magical, whimsical effect.

# 15. Turn It into a Bar or Beverage Nook

Slide in a tray or small cart with drinkware, a decanter, or coffee and tea accessories. It’s an unexpected and functional way to repurpose the space.",1,1748417293.0,u_jcdesignbuild1,0,1.0,False

## What is Xybero Renda?

Xybero Renda is an **automated trading platform** that lets users trade cryptocurrencies and other assets using algorithms and real-time data analysis. It claims to use **AI and machine learning** to help users make smarter trading decisions — even if they don’t have years of experience.

Think of it like a robo-advisor for crypto and forex. You sign up, fund your account, configure your preferences, and the system does most of the heavy lifting. It monitors the market 24/7, looks for profitable opportunities, and executes trades on your behalf. 

For people who don’t want to stare at charts all day or guess when to buy/sell, Xybero Renda offers a hands-off approach. That said, like any trading bot, it’s not magic. There’s still risk involved.

## Who Created Xybero Renda?

Details about the creators of Xybero Renda are a little vague — which, to be fair, is pretty common in the world of trading platforms. While they don’t feature a flashy team page, it’s likely developed by a group of fintech professionals and software engineers with prior experience building AI-based trading systems.

Based on the platform’s tech stack and functionality, it seems inspired by earlier models like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**, which also rely heavily on automated trading. So while we don’t have a specific name to drop, the tech appears solid and possibly built by folks who know what they’re doing.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Xybero Renda Today](https://tinyurl.com/3e6scsta)
## How Does Xybero Renda Work?

Xybero Renda works by using **real-time market data** and AI algorithms to identify trading opportunities. Once users create an account and make a deposit, the system begins scanning market conditions to execute trades that align with the user’s risk preferences.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:
- You sign up and verify your account.
- You deposit a minimum of $250.
- The algorithm starts analyzing markets (crypto, forex, stocks, etc.).
- When it spots a profitable opportunity, it places trades automatically.
- You can monitor everything from the dashboard and even set up **custom alerts**.

What’s nice is that you don’t have to babysit the platform. You can let it run in the background while you go about your day. But if you’re a control freak like me, you can still jump in manually whenever you want.

## Xybero Renda Pros and Cons

Let’s be real — no platform is perfect. But here’s where Xybero Renda shines and where it could do better.

**Pros**
- ✅ **User-friendly interface** – Great for beginners.
- ✅ **Automated trading** – Saves time and removes emotional bias.
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset classes** – Not limited to crypto.

- ❌ **Requires upfront deposit** – $250 might be steep for some.
- ❌ **Limited educational resources** – Beginners might wish for more tutorials.

Xybero Renda isn't just for crypto. You can also trade:
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**
This gives users more flexibility and helps spread out risk.

## Is Xybero Renda a Scam?

This is the big question, right? Based on my testing and comparing it to similar platforms like Bitcoin Code, **Xybero Renda doesn’t appear to be a scam**. It has legit functionality, a responsive support team, and a growing user base.

On Sunday, one of our closest family friend came to congratulate him and it was all in good taste until they tried to set up their daughter with him. A bit of background- my brother has been in a relationship for 5-6 years now with his batchmate and their relationship is pretty solid. Our parents don't know about her but I have met her a few times and she is super nice. The only reason my brother hasn't told our parents about her is because she is from a different religion.

So basically first it was all casual talks and asking about life in general but when the coffee arrived, they immediately shifted the topic to marriages and proposed something on the similar lines as getting them to know each other and all and I almost spat in my coffee because the first thing my brother said when she came was ""arey yaar ye fer aagayi"" (ah she came again with a negative connotation). The thing is their wavelengths don't match at all and she used to hit on him in the past even after he told her he was committed and their acquainted state got strained. She was chill with me though and I don't have any particular problem with her but I know that my brother hates her guts so the situation was quite funny. 

My brother stepped in and said in a casual way that its too early to even think about it and he will think about it after completing his post graduation. Her father understood what he was trying to say and backed off but her mother just started and never stopped 😭she was saying things like ye toh dekhe dikhaye ghar se h apne bacchon jaise hi h (basically trying to establish the fact that we are so close and all). She basically coerced him to talk with her and they went outside and returned after about 10-15 minutes. 

She just whispered something in her ears and that aunty spent the next good 10 minutes explaining how college relationships don't work out like girl just let it go. 

I was shocked at how she believed that college relationships dont work out but this arrange marriage set up in which their is obviously no chemistry between them will work out some how lol. Just the sheer audacity made me crack up a bit.",31,1748417088.0,AskIndianWomen,9,0.92,False

He was not born.  
He *appeared.*  
Somewhere between a particle split and a mother’s silence.  
The world didn’t welcome him;  
it just didn’t stop him.

INTJ:  
The acronym they gave to men  
who feel like locked rooms  
with a single chair—  
and a knife.

He doesn’t smile. He studies.  
The way blood dries.  
The way people leave.  
The way trust has a flavor—bitter, metallic, and fast-dissolving.

He reads Camus like scripture.  
Not for hope—  
for precision.  
And Nietzsche whispers across his spine,  
*“If they stare long enough, make them blink first.”*

He’s tasted love, yes.  
It came wrapped in timing and fire,  
two souls typing the same words at once,  
like fate forgetting its own rules.

But don’t be fooled.  
He’s lost more than he’s held.  
People vanish.  
Mid-chapter.  
Mid-tragedy.  
No note, just a cutscene.

He never forgot them for that.

So now he walks.  
Not toward,  
not away—  
but **through.**

Reality is a hallway with flickering lights.  
One foot in physics,  
one in the fiction of serial killers who were only slightly less curious than he.  
He doesn’t admire them—  
but he *understands.*

In labs, he is God.  
In friendships, a ghost.  
In pain, a scientist.

He drinks coffee like it’s communion.  
No sugar. No milk. Just bitterness, clean and burning.  
It's the only thing that tastes like truth.

He loves—but not softly.  
He loves like a question no one dares to answer.  
A cat would know. A bird might flee.  
The INFP girl once saw a glint.  
He let her.

But even she cannot stay.  
No one stays.  
They see the abyss,  
and forget he lives there with furniture.

He talks to walls.  
Not out of madness,  
but because they listen better than people ever have.

He plans rebirth in another city—  
not for joy,  
but for **control.**  
To reset the equation.  
To walk with silence and say,  
*""Now it’s my turn to leave first.""*

He knows what he is.  
Not broken.  
Not lost.  
Just built wrong  
for a world that still runs on fairy tales and morning smiles.

He would rather walk until the end of roads,  
trace murder motives like math,  
play football with strangers,  
feed birds, adopt a cat—  
than ever be *known* by the wrong hands again.

The One Who Walks Between Worlds?  
No.  
He walks **outside** them.

1kxax25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kxax25/mile_marker_237/,Mile marker 237.,"The road was long, straight, and empty—just like it had been for the past six hours. Hal Dawson gripped the wheel of his 18-wheeler with calloused hands, his knuckles pale under the flickering green glow of the dash. He was halfway through Nevada, somewhere between nowhere and nothing, hauling twenty tons of frozen meat across the desert in the dead of night.

Hal was used to solitude. After thirty years on the road, loneliness didn’t bother him anymore. What bothered him tonight was the feeling. That strange itch behind the eyes. The one that made the hairs on his neck stand up. The one that said: You’re not alone.

He glanced at the side mirror. Nothing but darkness stretching beyond the trailer. Then the other. Still nothing. But the feeling didn't go away.

A sign whizzed past:
Mile Marker 237.
He made a note of it without thinking. That’s when he first saw the figure.

Just a flash. A shape. Standing at the edge of the road. Pale and still.

He braked hard, heart thudding. Tires screamed. The truck shuddered to a stop.

He scanned the mirrors again. The road behind him was empty. No figure. No silhouette. No sign of life.

Maybe he was tired. Sleep-deprived. Seeing things. Still, he reached over and grabbed the thermos of lukewarm coffee, his fingers trembling. Took a swig. Lit a cigarette. Rolled on.

A few miles later, the CB crackled, though he hadn’t touched it.

White noise first. Then a low whisper.

“Hal.”

His name.

The voice was distorted, like it came from underwater—or underground.

He froze. “Who the hell is this?”

Nothing. Just static.

He shut the CB off.

The road unspooled before him, dead silent again. Desert scrub blurred past in the headlights. The moon was a thin sickle, pale as bone. He passed a dead coyote by the shoulder. Then another.

Then something worse.

A third coyote. But this one was standing up.

It turned its head slowly as the truck passed, eyes like wet marbles reflecting the light. Blood matted its fur. Its mouth was open, teeth bared in something that wasn’t quite a snarl.

He slammed the brakes again. Stared through the rearview.

Gone.

Hal cursed, slapping the dash. “You’re losing it, old man.”

He reached for his radio to call another trucker, maybe make contact—just to hear another human voice—but remembered he’d shut it off. He didn’t turn it back on.

The odometer ticked past another sign.

Mile Marker 237.

Hal blinked. That couldn’t be right.

He looked at the clock: 3:23 a.m.

Checked the GPS. No signal.

His jaw tightened. Maybe the sign was mislabeled. That happened sometimes, right?

He kept driving.

An hour later, another green sign reflected in his high beams.

Mile Marker 237.

The blood drained from his face.

“No,” he muttered, shaking his head. “No. I didn’t turn around.”

He looked behind him. The road was a black ribbon. He hadn’t passed a turnoff, a gas station, a fork—nothing. He hadn’t stopped. He hadn’t turned.

But here he was again.

Then something moved in the cab.

Hal turned his head sharply. The passenger seat—empty.

But… not completely.

The seatbelt was stretched out, buckled, as if someone invisible was sitting there. The fabric was pulled taut.

“Jesus Christ,” he muttered.

He unbuckled his own belt, reached over, and unlatched the passenger side. The seatbelt recoiled violently—too fast—snapping back like it had been under tension. It cracked against the window.

Hal stepped on the gas.

The CB crackled again.

“Still running, Hal?”

He ignored it. Focused on the road. Focused on forward.

The engine groaned. The rig was heavy, but he pushed her harder than he ever had. The world blurred past. A mirage of black and silver and sand.

Then up ahead—more movement.

Figures on the road.

Dozens of them.

Standing at attention on either side of the highway. Men, women, children. Pale. Stiff. Still. Their eyes all tracking him. Every face dead and watching.

As he passed them, he saw they had no mouths.

He screamed. Actually screamed. A dry, broken sound that barely escaped his throat.

Then, finally—blessedly—headlights.

An oncoming vehicle.

A dusty patrol car with its lights flashing.

Relief washed through him. He honked and flashed his brights.

The cruiser passed without slowing. In the moment they were side by side, Hal saw the driver.

It was him.

Same face. Same flannel. Same scars on the knuckles.

And his eyes were bleeding.

The patrol car vanished into the rearview.

Hal didn’t stop again. Didn’t blink. Didn’t think.

Then the final sign came.

Welcome to Mile Marker 237.

No miles to anything. No exit. Just that.

Then the world… changed.

The sky cracked, peeling away in slivers like paint. The stars blinked out one by one. The road began to curl, loop, and spiral like a serpent devouring its own tail.

And still, he drove.

Because now he could see it.

The thing in the passenger seat.

Tall. Thin. Wearing his dead wife’s face like a mask.

Grinning without a mouth.

Whispering without a voice.

And Hal finally understood:

You don’t leave Mile Marker 237.

You just drive in circles…

## What is Trilox AI?

Trilox AI is an **automated trading platform** designed to analyze financial markets using artificial intelligence. It claims to help users make smarter, faster trading decisions by using **machine learning algorithms** to detect trends and patterns in real-time.

The idea is simple: you deposit funds, set your preferences, and let the AI scan the market to suggest or execute trades. You can be hands-off or hands-on, depending on your trading style. Think of it like Robinhood meets ChatGPT, but for trading strategies. For beginners, it’s a way to jump into the market with some guidance. For pros, it’s a tool to streamline and optimize decisions.

## Who Created Trilox AI?

Trilox AI doesn’t have a celebrity founder like Elon Musk or a big-name VC backing it (at least not publicly), but it was reportedly built by a team of **financial analysts, software engineers, and AI researchers**. The platform is operated by a group that has experience in fintech and algorithmic trading, much like the teams behind Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

They’ve partnered with **regulated brokers** to handle the actual trades, which is a good sign—it shows they’re not just running a random script behind the scenes. While transparency could be better (more on that later), the tech seems solid and actually functional.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Trilox AI Today](https://tinyurl.com/yc32h3ky)
## How Does Trilox AI Work?

The core of Trilox AI is its **machine learning engine** that processes massive amounts of market data in real-time—think news headlines, historical charts, social media sentiment, and more. Based on that, it generates trading signals or even places trades automatically, depending on your settings.

Here’s a simple breakdown of the process:
- **Data Collection**: Pulls market info 24/7
- **Analysis**: Detects patterns and possible price movements
- **Signal Generation**: Offers buying/selling suggestions
- **Execution**: Automatically places trades (if auto-trade is enabled)

You can also set risk tolerance, stop-loss limits, and other parameters. It’s not a magic money printer, but it **reduces a lot of the manual guesswork**, especially for people who don’t want to stare at charts all day.

## Trilox AI Pros and Cons

Like any platform, Trilox AI isn’t perfect. But it has more things going for it than against.

### Pros
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Real-time data crunching gives a strategic edge.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Great for beginners and non-techies.
- **Demo Mode**: Practice before risking real money.

- **24/7 Support**: Live chat responses are actually quick.

### Cons
- **Minimum Deposit**: $250 entry fee might scare off casual users.
- **No Transparent Team Info**: Would be nice to know more about the creators.
- **Market Volatility Still Applies**: AI isn’t magic—it can’t predict black swan events.

### [👉 Open Your Trilox AI Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/yc32h3ky)

A fun, kid-friendly cartoonish landscape with a winding continuous path that moves from start to finish with two checkpoints along the way. The path should have 45 stamp spots (little blank circles), grouped like this:

* → 15 steps → Coffee shop with  cinnamon buns 
* → 15 steps → Ice Cream Stand
* → 15 steps → Restaurant (final goal) ",1,1748416722.0,generateforme,0,1.0,False

The barista, who I’d say is kinda cute, was there, and we somehow ended up in this silly debate about the superior season: summer or winter.

Me: ""Obviously summer's the winner, ya know, cause of all the sunshine and beach days.""

Him: ""But winter has cozy sweater weather! Plus, hot chocolate – I mean, c’mon.""

I mockingly gasped, ""Did you just diss ice cream? The audacity!"" 

He laughed and said, ""Okay, okay, I see your point, but winter has fireplaces you can't beat.""

We kept it going for a few minutes until the line behind me got antsy. He winked (not gonna lie, it was kinda charming) and said, ""Guess we'll have to settle this with a winter vs. summer trivia game next time? Loser buys the coffee.""

My grandparents lived here, so as a kid we’d visit during the holidays. But I grew up, studied, and worked in Bangalore. Kottayam was always the place we came back to for Christmas and Karimeen, not real life.

In 2020, my parents moved back here for good. Since then, I’ve been visiting whenever I could usually a long weekend or a quick week off. But now, for the first time, I’ve taken a fully remote role and have the flexibility to live wherever I want. Which means I’ve been seriously considering being based here. Not visiting. Actually staying.

There are obvious pros. It’s quieter. Cheaper. The fish is fresh. I can sit on a verandah and stare into the middle distance without anyone asking if I’m okay. But the one con that keeps bugging me is this—I might not have a social life.

Which brings me to the question. How does someone who’s nearly 30 make friends in Kottayam? I don’t mean “my cousin’s cousin” or the guy from church who wants to sell insurance. I mean actual friends. People to grab coffee with, go for a movie, complain about life, and maybe swap memes in between.

Met this super sweet guy on Hinge, we’ve been vibing for like 2 weeks, all cute and flirty but nothing too crazy. Finally decided to meet IRL. Plan: coffee date, casual walk, maybe a kiss if the vibe’s there.

Reality: chaos.

We meet, it’s going great, he’s even cuter in person, we’re laughing, walking, all those cheesy rom-com things. Then, we pass by this random little park with swings and he’s like, “Wanna hop on?” I’m thinking, sure, let’s be quirky.

BIG MISTAKE.

I go full send, hop on the swing, try to be all cute… and immediately flash him because I forgot I was wearing a wrap skirt with basically nothing underneath. 🫠

His face went BEET RED and I’m just sitting there like a malfunctioning NPC, legs mid-air, skirt flying, brain buffering. He just blurts out “nice” (??? bro wtf) and then deadass offers to push me like nothing happened.

I. Am. Mortified.

But also??? He kept making all these little comments the rest of the date about how “spontaneous” I am and how he “wasn’t expecting that”. Same, dude. SAME.

We ended up walking for like two more hours and ngl… the tension was palpable. Didn’t kiss though — mostly because I couldn’t stop thinking about my accidental park peep show.

Now I’m home, overthinking everything, and wondering… should I text him? Should I just let it be the chaotic meet-cute it was? Idk.

Anyway, moral of the story: always check your outfit before attempting to be quirky in public.

TLDR: went on a wholesome first date, accidentally flashed him mid-swing, now I’m debating if I should text or wait for him to slide into my DMs first. 👀",48,1748416217.0,tifu,30,0.77,False

Think of it like this: if childhood memories were a dish, they'd be plated with an intricate sauce of sensory molecules. Just this morning, I encountered what I affectionately called a 'nostalgia plume,' a fleeting vapor cloud released from my morning coffee, that whisked me back to the innocent wonder of Saturday morning cartoons.

Here's where it gets sciency: these particles, let's say 'Proustons,' interact with my olfactory receptors, causing a cascade of memory-releasing neurotransmitters. Picture a bunch of tiny, whimsical scientists in my brain, eagerly documenting each historical tidbit they retrieve: snippets of laughter, the sound of an opening cartoon theme, even the texture of the carpet where I'd watch TV. It's all there, cataloged in some mysterious, musty neuronal library.

Quantifying nostalgia is inherently absurd, yet here we are. I might propose a unit of measure—the 'Huggle,' for that comforting embrace of childhood-longings—arguably less precise than millimeters but infinitely more significant in the realm of emotions. The intensity of Proustons could theoretically be a variable in this equation: one whiff of a familiar scent and the Huggle meter spikes.

Of course, such probing inquiries don't entirely capture the ephemeral nature of this experience. It's not like flicking through an old album; it's like accidentally setting off a sprinkler system in the mind's memory wing, nuances spilling over.

Might be wrong, but I'm convinced this scientific-sounding metaphor format helps dissect these complex feelings... details that make life uniquely textured.

I'm not a huge fan of jogging, tbh, but I figured some fresh air would do me good. Anyway, halfway through my route, I noticed this guy jogging in the opposite direction. I swear, each time we crossed paths, he had this cheeky smile that was impossible to ignore.

During lap three, when I was ready to give up and collapse on the nearest park bench, he slowed down next to me just as I paused for a 'I'm-not-dying-just-catching-my-breath' break. We shared a chuckle over our mutual ""endurance"" (aka pretending not to be ready to pass out), and he casually remarked, ""I must be running in circles... or is it fate that keeps us meeting like this?""

I laughed and shot back with my best witty banter, ""Well, clearly the universe insists you owe me a coffee the next time we *conveniently* bump into each other."" He grinned, agreed it was a ""date,"" and jogged off with a hilariously exaggerated salute.

I met people in person in bars and other places and had a connection but through online dating - nothing.

It opened my eyes that it may be me when I met my long distance girlfriend who I firstly met last August and we had such a strong connection, we felt like we have known each other for years. 

Not until I saw her 2 weeks ago, we had no connection at all and later that day she told me she didn't feel anything which was heartbreaking. 

I went to visit her for 3 days in her city and I stayed in a hotel during that time.

During the time we met, we had a date on a bench with take out so I couldn't hug her or kiss her, then it got late so we went home. Then 2nd date on the next day, she wasn't too available emotionally it felt like she had her guard up and I was nervous as well whether she will like me or not.

I've been on countless of dates and I get the same message - ""I felt no connection""

Usually the dates go like this:
- either we go for coffee or an activity
- we chat about our families, things we are passionate about, challenges, risks we have taken - mostly deep topics

During the first dates, there's barely any kissing or physical contact. I used to be more forward and remember that things were working out better but now, I am very cautious of people's space and I wait until we ar both comfortable.

1kxae5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1kxae5j/does_coffee_really_boost_your_immune_system_heres/,Does Coffee Really Boost Your Immune System? Here’s the Truth!,"**Coffee lovers rejoice—but is your morning cup of joe doing more than waking you up?** Can it actually *strengthen* your immune system? Let’s dive deep into the facts, science, and expert opinions to uncover the truth. As always, we’re bringing real-life user experiences and insights from top coffee experts to keep things grounded, transparent, and honest—just like everything on **gomehedi.com**.

 

# ✅ Quick Answer

Yes, **coffee can support your immune system**, thanks to its **antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties**, and essential nutrients. However, it’s not a magic bullet. Your lifestyle, sleep, and diet matter too. Let's break it all down!

 

# 🧪 Scientific Research: How Coffee Interacts with the Immune System

According to **multiple peer-reviewed studies**, coffee contains over **1,000 bioactive compounds**, including:

·         **Chlorogenic acid**

·         **Caffeic acid**

·         **Polyphenols**

·         **Melanoidins**

These compounds **act as antioxidants**, which neutralize harmful free radicals in your body—this is **crucial for immune health**. Free radicals, if left unchecked, can weaken your immune response and make you more vulnerable to infections and diseases.

**Research Insight**:  
A 2021 review published in *Nutrients* highlighted that **moderate coffee consumption (2–4 cups/day)** is associated with **lower levels of inflammation**, improved liver health, and **better immune biomarkers**.

 

# 🧠 Expert Opinion: What Coffee Scientists Say

We spoke with **Dr. Amelia Rosales**, a nutritionist and food scientist specializing in immune function and natural compounds:

**""Coffee is more than caffeine. Its antioxidant load helps the immune system indirectly by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which are both drivers of weakened immunity.""**

Similarly, **Dr. Robert Klein**, author of *The Coffee Code*, told us:

**""Your immune system is like a defense army. Coffee provides some of the key shields—mainly through its polyphenols and magnesium content—but it still needs your diet, exercise, and rest to perform well.""**

 

# 💬 Real User Experiences from the [gomehedi.com](http://gomehedi.com) Community

We asked our audience:  
**“Have you noticed fewer colds or stronger immunity after adding coffee to your routine?”** Here's what some had to say:

# ☕ Sarah M. (California, 34):

""I used to get sick every other month, but after switching to black coffee with turmeric and cinnamon, my energy is up and my colds are down. Could be coincidence, but I think it helps.""

# ☕ David R. (Texas, 52):

""I drink mushroom coffee with reishi and chaga daily. Haven’t had a bad flu in 3 years. I swear it supports my immune system.""

# ☕ Lila A. (Florida, 28):

""I feel more energized, sleep better, and my digestion improved after adding a cup of coffee in the morning. It might not directly boost immunity, but it makes my body feel stronger overall.""

 

# 📊 Nutritional Breakdown: Coffee’s Immunity-Boosting Compounds

||
||
|**Nutrient / Compound**|**Role in Immunity**|
|**Chlorogenic Acid**|Fights inflammation, antioxidant defense|
|**Magnesium**|Supports white blood cells and immune enzymes|
|**Niacin (Vitamin B3)**|Cellular energy, helps immune cell repair|
|**Caffeine**|Boosts alertness and indirectly supports stress response|
|**Polyphenols**|Antioxidant and antimicrobial effects|

 

# 🍄 What About Functional Coffee (e.g., Mushroom Coffee)?

Functional coffee infused with **superfood mushrooms** like **Chaga, Reishi, and Cordyceps** is gaining popularity among wellness enthusiasts.

These mushrooms have been traditionally used for centuries to:

·         **Enhance immunity**

·         **Balance stress hormones**

·         **Fight inflammation**

Many users on **gomehedi.com’s social platforms** report fewer sick days and improved resilience when drinking functional mushroom coffee regularly.

 

# ❗ But Coffee Alone Isn't Enough: The Whole-Body Approach

While coffee offers **immune-boosting benefits**, relying on it alone isn’t wise. According to **Harvard Health**, the best immune support involves:

·         A **nutrient-dense diet**

·         **Regular physical activity**

·         **Quality sleep**

·         **Hydration**

·         **Stress management**

Coffee **complements** this lifestyle—not replaces it.

 

# ⚖️ Who Should Be Cautious?

Some people should moderate or avoid coffee for immune health reasons:

·         **People with autoimmune diseases**: Overstimulation might worsen symptoms.

·         **Those with anxiety disorders**: Caffeine may elevate cortisol (stress hormone).

·         **Pregnant women**: Stick to safe caffeine limits (\~200mg/day).

·         **People with insomnia**: Poor sleep undermines immunity—avoid coffee late in the day.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

 

# 💡 Tips to Maximize Coffee’s Immune-Boosting Benefits

·         ✅ **Drink it black** or with plant-based milk to avoid added sugar

·         ✅ **Add turmeric or cinnamon** for extra anti-inflammatory power

·         ✅ **Choose organic or low-acid coffee** for better digestion and nutrient absorption

·         ✅ **Time your coffee** early in the day to avoid disrupting your sleep

 

# 🗨️ Final Word from the [gomehedi.com](http://gomehedi.com) Team

So, **does coffee really boost your immune system?**  
✅ **Yes—but indirectly and as part of a bigger health puzzle**. It enhances immune function through antioxidants, inflammation reduction, and supporting overall wellness.

Our advice: **Enjoy your coffee daily**, preferably **black or with immune-friendly add-ins** (like mushrooms, cinnamon, turmeric). Pair it with a healthy lifestyle for the best defense system your body can have.

All in all I'm at the typical stage where I miss sugar I kinda get bored of eating the same thing but the Green Chef does give us some variety but every now and then you have to ride the wave of thinking I just wanna eat crisps or chocolate or ice cream And after while you get over it.

But Z is a sensitive, kind person. Comes from an abusive neglectful family and still lives with them- trying to help them gain confidence and independence. 

Now, Z partially lives with me at this point. They stay over with weeks to months at a time, and very often. They have their own closet in my room and I give them a section of my shelf for their things. I have two cats in my room as well. They also have a bird and bring it with them everytime.. bird stays in my room with my cats.. it gets crowded and I've had to compromise my own space a lot but they're going through a rough time and I want to be there for them- so I don't mind them. I enjoy their company too. I get them expensive gifts during holidays because I can afford it- they can't get me much but still get me things they know I like and I really appreciate it as i know it's been hard for them with their whole situation.

I always make us breakfast in the morning, coffee, funny shaped sandwiches- get them snacks and they always choose things during grocery runs. I've gotten them basic nessicities like shampoo, soap, etc. I even buy their pet food because they can't afford it sometimes. 

Now. I do lots of things for them- i don't want them to feel like they OWE me but at the very least I expect them to clean up after their own mess and help with chores. 
But they get tired easily and ask me for help with these simple chores or sometimes ask if I can do them instead. (Mind you I don't ask them to do ALL my chores I ask for half or some) like laundry, dishes, changing my cats litter boxes, sweeping. 

They tried to get out of sweeping by claiming they didn't know how to do it but I was like ""it's okay ill teach you!"" But they admitted they knew how they just didn't want to do it. 

These really irked me- am I the asshole for expecting some help with things when I basically provide everything? I know I shouldn't expect things back but. Hell I'm paying for two people and doing double the work to clean up after two not just me. Plus their pet makes my room a lot dirtier a lot faster.. 

I've had to downsize and get rid of some of my clothes to make room for theirs. I feel like I'm entitled to some help?

And it's not like I'm asking for free labor- they house and pet sitted for me while I was on vacation and I paid them for it. 
When we go to the mall I get them one thing they ask for. 

It feels more like taking care of a child than having a friend. 

I just feel like I'm entitled to help with things if I'm going to be providing for the both of us and am paying for two. But whenever I ask they get upset- they kinda shut down or cry or over correct their mistakes and it gets annoying. I feel like I can't communicate with them without them shutting down.

Having to scour my favorite roasters every couple of weeks/days to see if their offer has changed and includes one of those varieties has become quite tedious. I know 90+ coffee exists, but I'm not necessarily looking for THAT exclusive.

So I humbly would like to ask for any roasters you know of, or resources that you use, to keep track of new rare lots. Cheers.",1,1748414141.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

1kxa6j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1kxa6j1/f4m_roleplay_plots/,[F4M] Roleplay Plots~!,"Hello all! I am looking for a roleplay partner, and before I get to the plot ideas, please read through some of my rules to see if you'll be a fit for them!

* Must be experienced and literate, and be able to write more than just 2-3 sentences and at most multiple paragraphs (2-3)
* Looking to play as 24+ age, it's just a preference for me to be roleplaying with people closer to my age
* Willing to set up the plot further and actually talk about it to make it both a plot we would like
* Mostly just not leave for days on end with no notice of why, I get it, we all have lives and things happen, just a small heads up would be nice. I will do the same if I were to leave for a few days or have delayed replies

Now onto the plots! These can be worked around and tweaked as we would want; these are just rough descriptions and such

1. ***Royal Rumble***\- Two Kingdoms that have been enemies for decades finally decide to bury the hatchet and become friends with one another. The Kings and/or Queens are formal and become close friends, but the Prince and Princess do not. Being raised on the hatred their families had for one another, the two seem not to be over it. They are constantly at each other's throats, making fools of one another by embarrassing them at balls and gatherings, blaming the other for their own wrongdoings, or just plain verbally attacking one another. Will the two ever get along, or will they still keep the long-dead family feud alive?
2. ***The Knight and the Alchemist***\- Years of training as a knight have finally paid off, and you have officially been given the rank of Knight, which means you will soon be sent outside the castle walls on quests for your Kingdom. After your first few missions of simple vanquishing monsters and enemies that threatened the people, the King had called to you for a special mission, one of his generals has gone missing and was last heard weeks ago as he was tasked to conquer a rebels base, but no word has come back on the Generals werabouts, so you are tasked to go and find the General but you were to be aided by an Alchemist, to help heal you and aid you in your long and trecherous journey. It was always a drag being paired with others, but it was the King's orders, and you dared not disobey. So the two of you set off on your quest, and you hope this Alchemist won't drag you down.
3. ***Lattes and Love-*** Working day in and day out has become restless, and a pick-me-up is always needed to get through the day, but not just anything. Coffee is the main addiction and aid for long days and late-night work. At first, the small coffee shop was just an easy place to grab a quick cup or two, but after a while, you started to go for more than just the coffee. The cashier girl who worked there from open to close was always the best part, aside from the caffeine. In the first few months, you barely noticed her and only thought about how much she worked there to see her nearly every day at the same time. But the few days you went and she wasn't there, oddly, you made you miss her; it didn't feel the same without her there. Eventually, you started to spend as much time as you could there just to see her and maybe make the occasional small talk with her, but every time you had a minute alone with her, people rushed in, but today was the day you were gonna ask her out! Would she reject you, be embarrassed and weirded out, or not know who you are? Oh god it's your turn to order, quick, ask her out!
4. ***Old and New Hollywood-*** Years of being Hollywood's number one bachelor and actor have kept you at the top, and your standards have only risen as well. But in your newest film, you decided to branch out a bit and be in your first musical, singing was never your forte, but you don't wanna be a one-trick pony. But with this you were expecting another top of the line Hollywood star but instead, you are forced to work with the new girl in Hollywood, this was not to your liking, and you were not to be forced to work with her if she was to make this movie a disaster and tarnish your name. You tried to get out of this film or use your connections to get you a different co-star, but the studio wanted her and her alone to play the part. You found out she was a theater girl with little to no actor training; she was just a singing and dancing theater girl from Broadway who was picked to star in this role and finally take her first steps into Hollywood. Will you choose to make peace with the new girl on the Hollywood block, keep things only peaceful for the press and public, or will every day on set be hell on earth dealing with the untrained actor?
5. ***Fandom RPs-*** This is just a list of fandoms that I can RP, and with these, I will play as my OC, you can play as an OC or a Canon character. Black Butler, MHA, Kakegiri, Delicious and Dungeon, ATLA, Soul Eater, AoT, One Piece, Naruto, Demon Slayer, JJK, Tokyo Ghoul, Beastars, Chainsaw Man, Fire Force, DandaDan, and Pokémon

If any of these RPs interest you, please shoot me a message with the word ""shocking"" in it so I know you read this post and such. Now these RPs can be romantic or not romantic, which is perfectly fine with me, and if you want, we can RP on Discord as well.

So shoot me a message if you are interested, have a nice morning/day/afternoon/evening/night, to everyone\~!",1,1748413956.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

At first it was good and helpful but I have always felt pressured to come back and book again even if I don’t need to see her. I usually just rant about work or what’s upsetting me, I have come to terms with the fact that I have a generalized anxiety and it comes and goes. She has diagnosed me as autistic too, which I’m not surprised about. I’m not into medication, I’m into nutrition, exercise and holistic healing. 

Recently she’s changed, talking about medications more and the only reason I keep booking back in is because every session she sets up another time. In the past when I dropped off from therapy she got a bit mad with me and said I can’t keep dropping in and out of therapy, at that point nothing was going on in my life and we were just chatting. 

2 months ago she suggested I try some of my friends adhd medication and I said I’m not adhd. This felt really strange/unprofessional. I did another quiz thing and sure enough I don’t have adhd. I was a bit annoyed at the suggestion of taking a friends meds which likely would have made me so anxious!! Like I avoid coffee for that reason. 

The last session I had with her she suggested maybe I look at SSRIs or antipsychotics as apparently a lot of people with autism take low doses and it helps with rumination, sensory overload, negative thoughts etc. I was shocked by this as, she said she couldn’t really chat about if further because it’s not her area of study I would need to see a psychiatrist. It was such a bomb to drop in the session without really explaining further. Obviously that chat made me spiral and she confirmed there’s nothing wrong with me, she isn’t suggesting it because she thinks I’m psychotic she just knows a lot of her adult autistic patients are on these drugs and it helps. 

Aside from this she doesn’t remember things I have told her, seems to just agree with most things I say or says yeah that’s tough you’re allowed to feel annoyed etc etc. 

Anyway, I’m kinda off her from the above and previous things. I know all the anxiety techniques, I have worked through traumas, I have done emdr, I know about my attachment style, I have a stable good job/home and don’t struggle to do anything. I’m not interested in medication and my anxiety comes and goes. I don’t really want to see a psychologist at all at the moment I have nothing to talk about but I’m scared to tell her because she will get annoyed with me. 

I genuinely feel like she has been to a conference recently and is pushing medication

I’ll drop the full story link if you leave a comment ""Required""","#  Disappointment. On the day I was supposed to get my marriage license, I found myself at city hall bright and early, waiting from 8 AM until it closed.

Just as I was walking out, feeling the curious stares from the crowd, I got a message from Austin Herrera, saying something had come up at work, and we'd need to re schedule

When I got back to our empty house, I opened my phone and saw an Instagram post from Austin's childhood sweetheart: \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\]

The photo showed a beautiful scene on an island, and in the corner, I could still see a guy with a well-defined physique.

Scrolling through the comments, it was all compliments and a bit of playful envy about having such a great friend.

After giving the post a like, I decided to reach out to my friend. \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

I'd been in love with Austin for six years, and during that time, I'd transformed from a young girl into a woman nearly thirty.

My family had been all about the wedding talk, and I kept bringing up marriage with Austin, but he always seemed to put it off.

Just when I thought I might be done waiting, he surprised me by proposing in public not too long ago.

Today was supposed to be the big day for us to get our license.

Two days ago, my mom called out of the blue, saying, ""Sweetie, I consulted someone, and they say the day after tomorrow is a perfect day for you to get your license.""

I couldn't help but laugh, and of course, Austin heard me. He pulled me into a warm embrace and assured me he was all in for anything I needed.

But then, right before our license appointment yesterday, he suddenly started packing his bags for a business trip. Before he left, he gently ruffled my hair and said, ""Don't worry, it's just for a day. I'll definitely be back in time.""

Looking into his calm eyes, I held back the words I wanted to say. I just smiled as I dropped him off at the airport, feeling happy. Even last night when we talked, he swore he was already at the airport.

Today, I woke up early, put on some light makeup, and headed to the city hall with my driver's license in hand. I couldn't help but daydream about the amazing life we'd have together.

As time ticked by, the fresh rose in my hand slowly wilted. I called Austin multiple times, but none of my calls went through, and I couldn't shake the worry that something might have happened to him.

I even reached out to a coworker who was supposed to be traveling with him, trying to get some intel. Turns out, they hadn't been on any trip at all.

""Ms. Parks, I heard Mr. Herrera took a week off just to get ready for the wedding. I'd be thrilled to attend your wedding,"" the guy said.

""I'll see you then,"" I replied, chuckling weakly before hanging up.

I still found myself wondering if this whole thing was some sort of surprise that Austin was planning for me.

When I finally got home, the place was empty, and as I flipped the lights on, I realized there wasn't going to be any surprise waiting for me after all.

Feeling a bit let down, I collapsed on the couch and tried to clear my mind about what Austin was actually up to.

Just then, I got a message from Austin: \[The company had a temporary issue. We'd have to get the license some other time.\]

I replied with a simple \[Sure.\]

Then, out of curiosity, I opened Instagram and found a post from Austin's childhood sweetheart. \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\] It was accompanied by a photo of an island.

There was a girl in a cute swimsuit lounging under a coconut tree, donning a wide sun hat and carrying a limited edition bag. And in the reflections of her sunglasses was a solidly-built guy snapping a pic of her.

Yeah, that was definitely Austin off on a supposedly ""temporary"" commitment.

Scrolling through the comments, I saw others lamenting how they wished they had a brother like him.

I couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, I felt pretty foolish. Just earlier, I was all worried about him, and now here I was, making excuses for his obvious lies.

I was so hopelessly dumb.

A dull ache settled in my chest. I'd been in love with Austin for six long years, and those sweet moments we shared were often tainted by things that didn't really belong to us.

There was his childhood sweetheart, Rosemary Read. Her parents had passed away when she was young, and she ended up being raised in Austin's home, which made them incredibly close, almost like siblings.

On my birthday, I'd find myself blowing out candles alone while he'd get wrapped up in some excuse related to Rosemary. He'd even bring her along on our dates, saying he couldn't leave her alone at home.

And when he finally proposed, he bought her a dress from the same collection he picked for me because, apparently, she liked it too.

All those memories flooded back, and every argument we had over Rosemary ended with that same phrase from him. ""She's just my little sister.""

My heart sank a little deeper, especially knowing he was off vacationing on some island with Rosemary while I sat at home waiting for him.

Six years. How many more of these could I take? Growing up without a father, I always wanted a complete family, dreaming that my future kids would have a happy home.

I smiled bitterly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out.

I even liked this post, hoping he'd take a hint. Then, I turned around and casually messaged a friend: \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Austin returned home three days later. He walked in with an icy chill hanging around him and stood in the foyer, waiting for me to come help with the bags.

I stayed put on the couch, not giving him a glance.

When I didn't move, he finally spoke up, ""Laurel, I'm home."" I just hummed and kept my eyes glued to the TV.

Noticing something was off, he hung his snow-drenched jacket by the door and made his way over to me. He wrapped me in his arms and softly asked if I was upset.

""Laurel, I'm sorry. That project was a bit tricky,"" he said.

I tuned into his steady heartbeat, which didn't skip a beat even when he lied.

""I saw Rosemary's Instagram,"" I shot back, locking my gaze on him to see how he'd react.

When I dropped Rosemary's name, I could see his face tighten with annoyance, and I could hear it in his voice. ""Rosemary just happened to be there, and I swung by for her birthday. How many times do I have to tell you I think of her like a little sister?""

Just like I thought, he was sticking to the same old script. ""Oh, so you had time for her birthday but no time to give me a call?"" I asked.

During the time I couldn't reach him, my mind raced, wondering if he was safe. I felt a lump in my throat as I fought to hold back tears in front of him.

Austin pressed his lips together and stubbornly added, ""What difference does it make? We still couldn't get a license anyway.""

I looked at him, the guy I'd spent six years with, and felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. For a moment, I didn't even want to argue.

Just then, the doorbell rang. I got up to answer it, and it was Rosemary. She had a big bag in her hand and smiled warmly at me. ""Laurel, you're here. I brought Austin's stuff he left at my place.""

She handed me the bag, revealing a bracelet around her wrist.

My heart dropped when I saw it, and I froze as I took the bag in my hands. That bracelet was special. Austin had traveled to several cities to get it for me.

When he gave it to me, he said, ""I hope this brings you luck.""

Turns out, what I thought was something unique between us, he had given to Rosemary too.

""Sorry, Laurel,"" Rosemary said, her hands together and her head tilted, her eyes wide with innocence.

# Chapter 2 Break Up

""You're not upset that Austin took me on vacation for my birthday, are you?"" Rosemary asked.

I looked at her, not saying a word, and quietly closed the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*\*

I went cold turkey with Austin. Every time we fought about Rosemary, it would spark a silent war. Austin had gotten used to this pattern, knowing that after three days, I'd be back in front of him, ready to make up.

I hadn't even drifted off to sleep when there was a loud knock at my door.

""Laurel!"" Austin shouted, his voice filled with frustration.

I opened the door, and he shoved his phone at me. ""How many times do I have to say it? Rosemary is just my sister! Why do you take it so personally?""

I was clueless. ""What did I do to her?""

""And you have the nerve to ask! Did you say something to her when she came over? Mom said she's been off since she got back, and now she's in the hospital because of her depression!""

I glanced at Austin's phone, the screen showing a picture of Rosemary lying weakly in a hospital bed, her wrist wrapped in thick gauze.

""I didn't say anything to her,"" I said. I was being honest.

Austin said to me sharply with one hand around my neck, ""If anything goes wrong with Rosemary, you can forget about marrying me.""

I wanted to call him a psycho, but I couldn't get half a sound out of my throat, and I frantically scratched at Austin's hand, desperate for him to let me go.

Just when I felt like I might pass out, he threw me to the ground and looked down at me, condescendingly saying, ""After everything we've been through, if you don't go after Rosemary again, I might actually think about marrying you.""

With that, he turned and stormed downstairs, snatching the keys from the table before slamming the door behind him.

I was left sitting on the floor, struggling to catch my breath. It felt like my heart was completely shattered. He made these wild accusations without a shred of proof, and it was like he was losing it over it all.

I wobbled a bit as I pushed myself up, steadying myself against the wall, and grabbed the phone that had been ringing off the hook on the nightstand.

""Laurel, it's been ages! Want to grab a drink?"" It was Erin George, my high school classmate, someone I hadn't seen in years.

She had just landed in Newton City and was only around for a day before she headed back.

Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I agreed to meet her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Erin had reserved a fancy dining room and invited a few of our close friends from the area. The vibe was chill as we all caught up, sharing stories from our lives while reminiscing about the good old times.

""So, Laurel, how are things with you and Austin? Still not married?"" Erin shot me a teasing look.

Back in the day, everyone figured Austin and I would end up together since we were high school sweethearts who went to the same college.

I tugged at the collar of my turtleneck sweater, avoiding eye contact as I swirled the wine in my glass before downing it. ""Nope. Guess it just wasn't meant to be.""

Polly Maxwell frowned, leaning in. ""Is it you or him who doesn't want it anymore?""

""It's him,"" I replied, feeling the weight of those words.

Suddenly, Polly slammed her hand on the table hard enough to send her fork clattering to the ground. ""Is it because of Rosemary? I warned you ages ago that she'd always be in the way between you two, but you wouldn't listen!""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and shake my head. I always thought Austin just liked pampering his ""sister.""

""Rosemary?"" Laura Watson chimed in, pulling out her phone to show us something.

She played a video that caught everyone's attention: there was Rosemary, wildly banging on a middle-aged guy with her heel. The man held her wrists firmly and was telling bystanders, ""My wife is just having a tantrum, so don't mind her.""

With tears in her eyes, Rosemary was begging, ""No, please help me!""

The video ended with a tall guy standing up to confront the burly man, announcing that the police were on their way. Just before he left, the burly guy leaned in to whisper something threatening to Rosemary.

""It went viral in my neighborhood—everyone was saying the guy was a psychopath and warned to be careful when going out."" Laura looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. ""It looked like Rosemary.""

""It's her,"" I said calmly, unable to shake the unsettling feeling.

The woman in the video looked just like Rosemary, from her hair to the outfit she wore.

Austin had vaguely mentioned that Rosemary had been molested as a child, leaving her with deep psychological scars. I couldn't help but think the psycho had something to do with her suicide.

""Quit bringing her up. I told you Austin's no good for you. When the hell are you finally gonna dump him?"" Polly, a bit tipsy, shot me a disapproving look, like she was ready to jump on me if I said I still had feelings for Austin.

Outside, the rain drizzled against the window, and I noticed a dull ache from the bruise on my neck.

I stared at the raindrops sliding down the glass, feeling a bit lost. ""Just a couple more days.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, Austin got in touch again. The whole Rosemary situation had somehow made the news, and I followed it reluctantly.

The report said the man was in a psychiatric hospital, and the girl who was involved was under close protection by her family.

I knew Austin was aware of the truth. When he called, instead of apologizing, he casually informed me he'd be home for dinner tonight. I shrugged it off, ""Anything else?""

The agent waited patiently for me to sign the contract, and I double-checked everything before putting my name down. Austin was quiet for a while, then finally said, ""Laurel, about the other day, I...""

I kept silent, waiting for him to continue. In the end, I didn't get the apology I expected. Instead, he blurted out, ""Let's get married, Laurel. I'll meet you at the city hall tomorrow.""

I couldn't help but smile ironically, feeling an unusual heaviness in my heart.

Had I been so indulgent with him over the years that I'd given him the impression this was how to make it up to me? Did he really think I was that easy to brush aside?

""No, thanks,"" I replied.

His displeasure was clear. ""What do you mean, no?""

I strolled over to the window to take in the view of Newton City, a place I'd been stuck in for what felt like ages. I moved here for Austin since his whole family was based in this city.

I saved up every penny to buy this house, hoping that one day, if I got married, my mom would come to live here with me. It'd make it easier to care for her.

But honestly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pretty selfish, making her move to a strange city just for me. Right now, though, I'd never felt more sober.

""I mean, we're done,"" I said.

Austin was about to say more when I heard Rosemary's voice blaring on the other end. ""Austin, where are you?""

He left me a quick, irritated ""Cut it out"" and hung up.

The agent beside me pretended not to notice the commotion and flashed a smile, saying, ""Ms. Parks, the funds will arrive within 24 hours.""

I nodded and handed him the key. ""Thanks. Here you go.""

# Chapter 3 Choices

After selling the house, I drove back to the place I shared with Austin and opened the door to an eerie stillness.

It seemed Austin hadn't been around for a while—he'd been busy taking care of Rosemary at the hospital.

I couldn't help but smirk a little. Honestly, that was fine by me. I'd rather not run into him.

Most of my stuff was in the second bedroom, and over the years, I'd had my fair share of arguments with Austin about Rosemary.

I had spent my time in that room during the rough patches and felt like I was constantly keeping my head down.

A bitter smile crept across my face as I packed up my things, remembering how submissive I used to be.

I didn't bother keeping anything that reminded me of Austin. Two hours later, I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead with a tissue, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.

Then, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was my mom. I hesitated for a second before answering. ""Hey, Mom.""

Her voice was filled with that familiar mix of excitement and nostalgia. ""Laurel, how's it going? Have you gotten the license yet? Have you and Austin talked about the wedding plans?""

I felt something tighten in my throat as I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

There was a long, awkward silence, and when my mom began to press me, I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, I'm not getting married.""

""What do you mean, Laurel? What's going on?"" Her tone turned anxious.

I tried to explain, ""I just don't think Austin and I are right for each other.""

Her voice rose slightly. ""But Laurel, you've been together forever! Why say this now, right before the wedding? Come on, you're 27, not a kid anymore.""

It struck me that without even asking what I was feeling, she just urged me to get married.

Tears filled my eyes, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from breaking down. After what felt like forever, I found my voice, ""Mom, I really just don't want to marry him.""

My mom didn't hold back her frustration. ""So what do you want, then? Just give up on all these years?""

When she heard my firm answer, her tone shifted. ""Laurel, how can you just say you don't want this after all this time?""

""Well, I just said it,"" I shot back, feeling overwhelmed.

My mom's voice suddenly went all high-pitched, probably still trying to convince me, and before she could make a sound, I heard a dull thud from the other end of the line.

""Mom?"" I called out but got no response.

A wave of panic hit me like a freight train. ""Mom! What's wrong? Please answer me!""

All I could make out was a faint moan of pain coming from her. My heart clenched tight, and I hung up in a hurry, flipping on the home security feed.

In my panic, my phone slipped from my shaking hands, sliding under the couch like it was covered in grease.

I dropped to my knees, desperately reaching for my phone. The security footage showed my mom, clearly in distress, clutching her chest and reaching for her medicine on the table.

All I wanted to do was dive through the screen and hand her the pills she needed.

I had only one thought racing through my mind: save my mom. I quickly opened my contacts and dialed my aunt, Bonnie Porter, who lived in the same building with my mom.

""Come on, pick up!"" I pleaded, praying she'd answer fast.

The ten seconds felt like an eternity, but finally, Bonnie picked up. I burst into tears, sounding like a total mess as I exclaimed, ""Aunt Bonnie, my mom is having an attack! You need to hurry!""

Bonnie sounded surprised but jumped into action, heading over to my mom's place while trying to calm me down.

I hung up and immediately called for an ambulance, anxiously switching back to the feed, just hoping someone would get to my mom in time.

At that moment, I regretted everything about moving to Newton City alone and leaving my mom all by herself. Watching her suffer through a screen felt like a nightmare.

I couldn't help but blame myself for being so hasty in talking to her and pushing her buttons.

The self-loathing and regret were overwhelming. I shouldn't have done that. I was so wrong. I promised myself, never again.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of two minutes, I heard the doorbell chime, signaling that Bonnie had entered the house.

She rushed in, looking almost like an angel descending from above, and quickly administered the medicine from the table to my mom.

Through the monitor, I watched as my mom's pale expression started to ease up while my phone slipped weakly to the floor.

Bonnie called me to let me know that my mom was out of danger, and I insisted she take her to the hospital for a follow-up.

It wasn't until I hung up that I felt like I'd regained my sanity, and my heart, which was racing like crazy, finally calmed down.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up the pace with my packing. The thought of leaving Newton City was getting harder to shake off.

The moving guys were still on their way, so I was waiting and checking in with Bonnie about my mom's condition when, out of nowhere, Austin appeared right in front of me.

The sound of the bouquet hitting the floor snapped me out of my phone trance, and I was taken aback by his sudden presence.

He was all dressed up in a sharp suit and tie, with his hair styled just right, showing off a smooth forehead that gave him a touch of mature charm. A bunch of delicate roses lay discarded at his feet.

His eyes looked stormy, filled with suppressed anger as he gritted out, ""Laurel, what do you mean by that?""

""Didn't I tell you? I want to break up. Do you not get it?"" My emotions were all over the place, and I was starting to lose my patience, saying whatever popped into my head.

He kicked the coffee table in frustration, sending glass flying, and pointed at the photo I had tossed in the trash, shouting angrily, ""I'm going to get a marriage license with you today. What do you mean?""

So that was why he dressed up—he thought we were heading to get a license. I assumed he dressed to the nine to pick up Rosemary from the hospital.

""I don't need that—"" I tried to shoot back.

Before I could finish, he cut me off, ""Didn't I promise to marry you? What do you want? Are you done with your little tantrum? If you don't marry me, what are you going to say to your mom?""

Looking at his smug face, I couldn't help but think he knew how much my mom had been looking forward to my wedding for ages.

So he knew all the time. He kept me waiting for three long years before finally agreeing to marry me, fully aware of my mom's situation.

It was just heartbreaking. What was I even doing falling for him?

I found myself staring at Austin in silence, my eyes reflecting a deep emptiness.

His anger started to fade as he seemed to regain some composure, and he began to softly coax me, ""I was wrong to stand you up, Laurel. Can we move past this?""

My resolve started to waver, but not because of him—it was all about my mom. I really worried that she would get so upset over everything that it would send her into another health scare.

She'd been adamant about me starting a family, and she'd definitely prefer Austin, the guy I've been in love with for years, over some blind date she barely knew.

That bruise on my neck was a constant reminder that I shouldn't just give in. But my mom was still stuck in that hospital bed, and it stopped me cold.
