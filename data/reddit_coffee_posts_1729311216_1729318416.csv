I have nobody in my life to talk to, and no happiness to feel. ","By relationships, I mean family, friends, girlfriends (although I've only had/have 1). I (a guy) just turned 18, got into a college that's considered to be a ""dream college"" and all in all, am doing okay life-wise. But I've never been this unhappy. 

I go to sleep every night, for more than a month now, feeling lonely and broken. I wake up early so I don't feel like shit and get out of the house so I don't have to talk to anyone. I don't really have anyone to talk to, I just am tired of things at home. My parents' marriage is screwed. They hate each other and their lives and their jobs. My mum doesn't really have a job, just savings from before. For the past couple of years, I've developed an almost chronic sense of stress, because despite being a nuclear family and my dad having a decent job, money problems never stop. They don't communicate, they don't work together and things just keep going to shit. We don't have much in the way of savings or investments. 

I struggle to talk to people now. I used to be open and talkative, sometimes with people I'm slightly close to I still am. But I can't talk to new people anymore. I don't want to open up or show emotions, because I'm afraid that like everyone else in my life, they might somehow make me feel awful about myself. The few friends I have like across the country, the only friend I have from highschool who I really opened upto doesn't have time to meet me anymore. 

My girlfriend of 2 years just told me she wants to take a step back, that she's not comfortable somehow with the physical aspects of our relationship, that she was pretending to like kissing me for a while now, something to do with her sex drive (not the right term, but idk what you else you can call not wanting to engage in physical affection). For the past 2 years I've always done dates her way. Go out, get a cab for a distance you can walk, get lunch and yayyy. The one time we went on a hike she shouted at me. 

I feel small and hurt which is ironic because I'm a rather big, athletic guy who wears shades and has a buzzcut. No one expects me to feel bad about things or show emotions and yet every night I curl up and cry. The only friend I have is my bicycle, and whenever I have an off, we spend hours together. People think I'm crazy for riding around the city, starting early in the morning but she's the only one who ever goes out to get coffee with me. 

I've lately been thinking a lot about offing myself too. Sometimes I think the only reason I've not done something is because of my parents and my younger brother. 

I wish I could've had one person in my life who would've stuck around and not treated my like everyone else. One person who had a soft spot for me, who'd maybe not leave me or create problems in the relationship, who'd take me out for just a coffee and go for a walk with me. One person who I could text without feeling like I was being an annoyance and who I could tell how I feel.

I have to say he's 5 years older than me (he's 37, both of us physicians). He wasn't late (he always is) and he insisted the coffee to be his treat which I found kind. The ""date"" was awkward af.

Basically I would like to buy a coffee machine, I have gone through a YouTube  rabbit hole and I am finding it extremely hard to make a decision so here I am hoping that some good soul will take few mins to help me.  

My situation is that I have a very small kitchen so I wouldn't want to take too much space. I live with my son, a minor, , so I consume two coffees a day plus some warm drinks I may make for my son. I also used to work on hospitality so I have done many years in professional coffee machines in the past.

Right now I am think a La Marzocco linea Micra (but I have looked at the sage barista pro, rocket, lelit Bianca, ascaso steel duo pid) and I still don't feel more confident about which way to go. Also, I know I want a good grinder but designed for small spaces, if possible

I have known someone since middle school and have had off and on interactions with him. A couple years back during quarantine we used to message back and forth everyday for a good couple months until it fizzled out and he ended up getting a girlfriend. I distanced myself heavily and it made me think well maybe he was just being nice as a friend.

I decided to reply and we got back to chatting again. He is now back in our state but still working out of town in the mountains.

I wish it could be more of an in person deal but I know that’s not really an option for him right now. Sometimes he won’t message back for a while or he will have shorter messages so I get a little paranoid that he’s trying to stop the communication but he keeps it going. What should I do? Should I move on and just try to forget it even though I already feel pretty attached? I really like him and honestly always have. It’s just I haven’t seen him in person in a good while.

But here in Sacramento, it seems like that culture doesn’t exist. Most coffee shops feel like they don’t want you hanging out, and it’s more about “grab and go” or staying glued to your laptop. Obo in Midtown comes close—it’s got that Italian vibe—but I feel like if I stood at the counter with my Americano, people would give me side-eye.

Anyone know of spots in Sac that encourage that stand-up, chat, and sip culture? Or am I just going to have to keep dreaming of Italy until my next trip? Would love to find something local!

Apparently my mother, my stepfather, my aunt, my grandmother, my grandmother's lesbian sister and her longtime gf made an arrangement to go to cracker barrel and someone decided to invite me at the 11th hour

I'm on Night Audit shift and generally I avoid walking the halls (unless I have to) for safety reasons. It is a generally safe area, but I'm  a female employee in the building alone so I try to lower my chances of putting myself in a potentially risky situation. I'm on my first fire walk of the night and I reach the 3rd floor. I start to walk past one of the rooms right off the elevator and notice the door is open, held open by the latch that you use to keep someone from entering the room. 

I knocked loudly and announced myself loudly about 3 times before carefully and slowly entering the room after no response. I was thinking maybe a guest had gone to grab something, realized they didn't have their key card and propped the door or something like that. I kept announcing myself just in case, I live in the South and it's possible a guest fell asleep and forgot to close the door and I don't want to be greeted by a gun. The full room can't be seen from the door. I peered into the bathroom - empty but the light was on. 

An empty Advil container from our little store in the lobby was laying on the little area we have for the coffee maker and such between the bathroom and the bed. I move forward again. No one at the desk. The TV has been pulled out a bit. I peer around the corner. 

No one. No one on the bed. The bed is stripped of pillows and blankets and maybe a sheet, while all appear to be piled on the Sofa bed. The TV has some loose screws sitting in front of it. No visible luggage or personal belongs. No trash other than the Advil container. As I left I checked the bathroom: toothpaste/water stains on the counter, some water dripping from the faucet and a hairdryer STILL plugged into the wall (there's a way to start a fire). I unplugged it and closed the door on my way out. After finishing my firewalk, I went to the computer to see what I could learn. 

The room had been occupied but the individual had checked out. The room was listed as Vacant Dirty. There were zero notes about the room in our communication log and no work orders put in concerning the room. 

I'm guessing housekeeping or maintenance accidentally left it propped open but it seems like housekeeping literally stopped right in the middle of cleaning the room. Maybe they decided to roll the room to the next day? Maybe they got called to do something else and we're planning to return to it? Who knows and I probably won't have that answer until next week due to my schedule.

I have been separated for 2 years (mentally for over 10). Haven't finalized divorce out of laziness - co-parenting really amicably. Been browsing on Bumble off and on for a few months. Haven't reached out to anyone until a few weeks ago when someone's pic & profile really really caught my eye. He included his IG and for the first time in my life, I messaged this random man. I just felt so drawn to him physically and emotionally. We've been messaging for a couple of weeks. The second time we messaged, it grew into an incredibly emotionally intimate and intellectually stimulating convo that got into NSFW territory. I cannot, at 49, remember ever feeling this way. I have been on a high that is like nothing I've ever known. I am in love with life, love, music, books, and people. I feel so much more love for my friends and family and it's like the entire world was just reborn. We're meeting for the first time in 2 days - getting coffee. I have ever been this excited or nervous for anything.

It’s been about three months since our breakup. Here’s how it all went down, and what I did to move ahead.","I'm a 33M, and I met a 32F on Hinge over the summer. At the time, I wasn’t too invested in finding someone serious, just curious about meeting new people during my break from work. So, I was pleasantly surprised when we matched, and I initiated the conversation, to which she quickly responded.  We quickly set up a date—I made the first move, which she liked. Our first date was at a coffee shop, and what I thought would be a casual meet-up turned into hours of conversation. By the time we finished talking, it was already 10pm, and we had agreed to a second date the very next day. The connection felt natural. The next day, we had lunch at a pizzeria after she got off work and we shared more about our lives. At one point, I playfully extended my hand, saying, ""Let’s see if you'd like a test drive."" We held hands the entire time. Afterward, she invited me to go to Target with her to pick up a gift for her friend’s birthday. She asked me if I wanted to come along with her. I declined, wanting to take things slow. During our conversation at the store, she mentioned being someone who knows what she wants and gets it, implying that she was open to a relationship. I paused because I wanted to think it through. I knew I’d be busy after summer and had my own personal flaws and insecurities, which I was upfront about. She didn’t seem phased, and that put me at ease, but I still wanted more time to process things. She then encouraged me to have more confidence in my decisions, and I felt like I needed to make a choice. I mentioned that I really wanted to take things slow, and she seemed okay with that. Still, I realized I liked her and felt safe around her. I even opened up about personal things quicker than I expected. I sort of half-accepted her offer to be her boyfriend that day. A week later, we had another date, this one even more spontaneous and relaxed. That’s when I felt ready, so I then chose to officially asked her to be my girlfriend, which she happily accepted again. We joked about having two anniversary days! By that point, the two of us were on cloud nine.

As you'd expect, we were deep in the honeymoon phase. Each date seemed better than the last, and we were riding the high of our new relationship. However, our phone calls and texts were surprisingly sparse. At first, I tried not to overthink it, but as you would expect for someone so anxious, my insecurities slowly crept in. I’ve always been someone who values consistent communication, so the silence between our interactions started to gnaw at me. Still, I made a conscious choice to try hard to take it in stride, reminding myself that sometimes relationships aren’t always perfect, and this one was worth working through. But over time, I couldn’t ignore the nagging feeling inside me that there was an unmet need.  Our time together was great, but when we were apart, it felt like there was a distance growing between us that we weren’t addressing.

I began to realize that we had vastly different attachment styles. Through the way she communicated—or rather, didn’t communicate—I noticed she seemed to lean towards being an avoidant. She didn’t seem to need as much contact or reassurance, which contrasted sharply with my anxious attachment style. While she appeared content with more space, I found myself longing for more closeness, reassurance, and consistent connection. It was a subtle but growing tension, one that I wasn’t sure how to navigate. I knew that my anxious tendencies could sometimes make me overthink situations, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that our emotional rhythms were out of sync. There was a part of me that feared if I brought it up too soon, it might push her away, but staying silent felt like I was slowly losing a part of myself in the process. Despite this, I kept holding on, hoping that as we spent more time together, we’d naturally find a balance. But deep down, I started wondering whether this difference in how we approached connection could eventually become a bigger issue for us. For now, I kept trying to meet her where she was, even though it sometimes felt like I was ignoring my own needs in the process.

Our relationship deepened, became more intimate, and before I knew it, the idea of marriage came up—almost unexpectedly. Suddenly, I found myself entertaining thoughts I hadn’t considered before. I was imagining us moving into an apartment together, thinking about finding a job outside of my current work, and even looking for ways to make more money so that we could support each other. It felt natural to start talking about meeting each other’s families, making future plans, and visualizing a life together. All of these thoughts, though new, felt exciting rather than overwhelming. I enjoyed every moment of this progression, feeling like we were moving toward something meaningful.  While everything seemed to be falling into place, I couldn’t ignore the subtle doubts creeping in. The more we talked about the future, the more I started questioning whether we were truly aligned in how we approached our relationship. We still hadn’t addressed the unspoken tension around communication, and the thought of committing to such a long-term plan while that gap still existed made me uneasy. 

I brought up the communication gap with her a couple of times, and I was honest about my own anxieties around it. Each time, she listened attentively, really making an effort to understand where I was coming from. Then, during one of our conversations, she asked, “*What should we do to work on this?*”  It’s such a small word, but that word “we” really caught me off guard. Up until then, I had always felt like I was carrying the weight of my emotions alone, but in that moment, she framed it as something we could face together. It wasn’t just me trying to figure out how to navigate my insecurities. That moment hit me hard because I had never experienced this level of partnership in a relationship before. Here she was, suggesting that we could tackle the problem together, and it brought me a huge sense of relief. I really didn’t know how to answer that question, but I thought to myself, maybe we could bridge the gap I had been feeling between us. It honestly felt like a breakthrough, and for once, I didn’t feel like I was navigating my emotions in isolation. It was refreshing, almost surprising, to finally be with someone who actively wanted to work through our issues together. I began to trust her more and opened up about how her avoidant attachment style affected me. 

At the same time, I also began to validate her own feelings, acknowledging that this might be just as difficult for her. She had told me before that she hadn’t had many long-term relationships, and I began to understand why—her avoidant tendencies probably made it challenging for her to connect deeply with someone over time. I wanted to be patient and supportive, just as she had been for me, because I knew relationships were a two-way street. I expressed my willingness to give her the space she needed while also hoping we could still find ways to meet in the middle. It felt like we were on the same page for the first time, both aware of our differences and ready to work through them. In that moment, I believed we were building something that could last.  
  
As summer drew to a close, I was navigating some significant transitions at work, including an exciting opportunity that could lead to a promotion. When I received the good news I had been hoping for, I was eager to share it with her. I expected us to celebrate together, but when I told her, her reaction was surprisingly muted. She said she was happy for me, but that was about it. The enthusiasm or deeper connection I had hoped for just wasn’t there, and I found myself feeling unexpectedly deflated. It wasn’t that she didn’t care, but this moment made me realize that our emotional responses were often out of sync. It was starting to feel like there was that emotional gap between us yet again, one that I wasn’t sure how to bridge. This wasn’t the first time I’d noticed it, but now it felt more pronounced, especially as we had been talking about the future. I decided to bring it up, hoping that a conversation might help us find common ground. When I brought up how I felt about her reaction to my news, her mood shifted almost instantly. Instead of addressing the issue together, as she had before, she seemed caught off guard and even defensive. She questioned our relationship in a way I hadn’t anticipated, asking whether she was truly what I needed. I hadn’t expected the conversation to take such a sharp turn, and before I knew it, she made the decision to end things. She chose to break up and immediately went no-contact, leaving me stunned. One moment, we were talking about the future, and the next, everything we had been building together unraveled. It was hard to process how quickly things changed, and I was left feeling blindsided. What had started as an attempt to strengthen our relationship ended with a sudden, painful disconnect. Looking back, it made me wonder whether this emotional gap had been larger than I realized all along.

As I continue to work through the loss of her, I’ve committed to weekly therapy. I’ve accepted that breaking the no-contact rule isn’t worth it, and trying to remain friends wouldn’t be healthy for me. It’s been about three months since the breakup, and while I no longer long for her specifically, I do miss the sweeter moments from that summer. I miss her smile, her eyes, and the feeling that every date was better than the last. And yeah, sure, I miss the sexual side of things, but honestly, just being around her for a few hours was enough. I miss having someone to relate to, someone to watch Marvel movies with. I miss geeking out on Dungeons and Dragons, building an adventuring party with her friends, and diving into those fantasy worlds together. More than anything, I miss the way being around her made me feel—like I could conquer anything and achieve whatever I set my sights on. It was a time when everything felt possible, and, almost selfishly, I miss the version of myself that came out because of her. I know that part of me is still there; it's just bruised at the moment. I’m sure I’ll get back to dating when the time feels right, but right now, it’s hard to imagine finding someone who could make me feel the way she did.  
  
I'm in a new chapter of my career right now, nearly at the halfway point of this year-long training program at my job that will determine if all my hard work is worth a potential promotion. It’s a pivotal moment, and as much as I’ve been focused on my career, I’ve also had to navigate the emotional aftermath of a breakup all while going through something so goddamn challenging. I’ve gone through the stages of grief numerous times, processing the loss of someone I had really grown fond of during the summer. She was a big part of that period, albeit brief, and there were moments where everything felt like it was falling into place. Even though I’ve accepted that she’s no longer part of my life, I can’t help but think about what could have been if she had stayed. I wonder if things would have been different had we worked through our differences, or if I could have done something more to close the emotional gap between us. 

The question keeps coming back to me: w*hy did she stay as long as she did if she knew about my insecurities and anxiety?* She was well aware of the parts of myself I had always been hesitant to share, yet she stayed through it all—until she didn’t. Did my openness push her away, or was there something else I did that she couldn’t handle? Was she just being ""performative""--going through the motions but also feeling like she was walking on shards of glass, as she described it? I keep replaying that moment in my mind, trying to make sense of it, but I realize I may never get the answers I’m looking for. Despite everything, I look back on my time with her with gratitude, even if it didn’t turn out the way I hoped or last as long as I wanted. 

I’ve definitely learned from the experience—about myself and what I need moving forward in a relationship. I now know I need someone who’s willing to stick around for the hard times, not just the good times. That said, I still question her motives, and I know I’ll likely continue to wonder about them for some time. I really don't know if I can find someone who can really demonstrate that kind of fortitude and compassion.  
  
The night we broke up, I couldn’t sleep through the tears. I woke up a bit puffy eyed at 2 in the morning, but I wanted to say SOMETHING. I wrote a long letter that I immediately burned afterward, but I kept the gist of what I wanted to say in my Notes app. I don’t think she’s the type of person to lurk on Reddit, so I feel pretty confident she won’t read it here, but here it is:  
  
*I write this letter knowing these words may never reach you, but I need to express my thoughts and feelings as we prepare to end our journey together.*

*I want to begin by saying thank you, because neither of us should part ways without acknowledging the value of our time together, whether it was long or short. Your presence was a breath of fresh air, giving me a renewed sense of my own worth and desirability. Thank you for bringing me reasons to smile as we envisioned a future together.*

*While I cherished our moments, I understand now that love is a partnership where both partners strive toward shared goals. I accepted you wholeheartedly, but when I was at my most vulnerable, you chose to walk away rather than address the issues together. You mentioned that neither of us should change for the other, but I wish you had considered that I wanted to change for myself. It’s painful to be left holding the seeds for change in my hands, while your sunny ways fade with the sunset, leaving me behind. But just like how seeds that can grow under different lights, I must now find that light within myself to nurture the changes I need.*

*I opened my heart to someone I believed would always be in my corner, and while I still hold that belief, I know that if I truly love you, I must let you go. It’s time for me to move on, even if it means doing so without you.*

*Thank you again. I love you, and goodbye.*

I am healing and doing the best that I can. I hope that wherever you are in your own breakup, you’re finding ways to take care of yourself, too. May sunny ways guide you.",2,1729315761.0,BreakUps30Plus,1,1.0,False

In the past year I've placed 25 orders and ""returned"" items 4 times. For one order, I bought a single item and they sent me 3 copies of the wrong color, so they offered me a replacement without having to return anything. But then they sent me another 3 of the SAME wrong color, so I asked for a refund instead and they did, and told me to keep or toss the 6 identically wrong items. 

On another order, a third party sent me a ""new"" item that was all scratched up, but CS kept asking me to return it so I argued that the seller will obviously just take my return and send it to someone else, and they eventually just refunded me without a return. 

And today, I received an ""insulated"" thermos that left my hot coffee cold in 2 hours. They asked me to return it, but I told them I didn't want to return a defective product that I've already used, and after a long awkward silence, they told me they'd offer me a ""one time"" refund without return. Was saying ""one time"" a warning that they won't allow it again?

I know this is dumb, but I genuinely believe it's unethical to return a defective product if I know a third party will try to resell it, or Amazon will just throw it away and the emissions and labor to get there were for nothing.

**TL;DR:** Am I going to get flagged if I keep refusing to send back products? They've all been under $20, and I did throw them away immediately. They also won't post my negative reviews on these products, so am I shadowbanned too?",0,1729315674.0,amazonprime,6,0.5,False

so... i'm in a bit of a pickle. i (M18) have been seeing this guy (19M) for about four months now, we started off talking online because we're both queer and we live in the same city. that continued for six-ish weeks, and during that time we got to know each other better. he's genuinely such a sweet guy, really down to earth and has a really good sense of where he wants to go in life. at the start of the second university semester (mid-July), we started ""going out"", and have been going on study/coffee/clubbing dates every week since. 

the issue is this: while i care for him deeply, i don't think i feel romantically about him. like, i know from my (only) past relationship that it took 3ish months to fall in love with my ex, but that was three years ago and i've gone through some shit which i think has affected my ability to love people romantically? 

in any case, i thought i was doing better this year and that i was emotionally ready for a relationship, but i've been thinking about things for a few weeks now and i've realised i am not in the right headspace to be in a relationship. i'm not matching his energy, and he deserves someone who is absolutely head-over-heels for him. i wish that could be me, but it's not. 

the other factor in this is that my mental health problem is complex enough that where i live, there are only a few psychologists who are properly equipped to treat it without making things worse. i've been keeping it in check with medication and exposure-response prevention therapy, but the latter has become too expensive to keep doing. that, as well as some physical health issues and the usual university stress, has led me to consider whether i should break up with my partner.

i really don't want to hurt him, he's had some absolutely awful exes who've messed things up for him before. but at the same time, he deserves a relationship where the other person is actually in love with him, and i've always been able to sort shit out better on my own. 

any advice? sorry about the shit formatting, it's my first time here haha

  
TLDR: due to some long-term mental health issues that have flared up recently despite treatment, i'm considering breaking up with my partner because he shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who doesn't love him back. ",1,1729315118.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I always wake up either too hot or too cold. Disoriented, often with a headache. No clue what time it is, and it throws my time clock off for the rest of the day. It makes it harder to sleep at night. It wastes time I could be doing something productive. I'm a zombie for the next half hour.

So here they are, free, broken into sections. No need to purchase a course. These are the same messages I will tell my own children.

Inner Self:

* Have a better positive relationship with money and capitalism. Don’t fear money and bills. You can’t measure what you don’t see. 

* Capitalism sucks, but it’s the only running system in this world. You need to figure out a way for yourself to live in this system. Money is not evil. It is just a tool.

* Manage your own risks, especially your vices: Drugs, unnecessary stunts, parlaying with sex workers, excessive gaming, excessive debts, etc. Be kind and be positive to yourself. Risky behaviors are very expensive. Value yourself. Value your time.

Health > Time > Money:

* That’s the order of things. When you are broke, you really don’t have all of them.

* Time matters in a way you usually don’t think about. You need to get invested in the stock market asap, as in tomorrow. But you should not bounce around doing stock trading in a rush. Buy stocks that have solid real assets behind them and stay invested in them for a long time. And you need to keep adding in a monthly basis.

* Don’t know how to pick stocks? Then don’t do it. Just use this cheat codes: VTI or VOO.

* Good health matters. A simple example: sleep. Bad sleep will impact your job which can turn into getting fired. Live a balanced life. Eat fruits and vegetables. Take multi vitamins.

* Back to time: Don’t be in a hurry. If you are rushing, you will fell prey to scammers. Be methodical. Even if you managed to get super lucky and acquired wealth very fast, the dopamine high is too high that you likely will mismanage that one lucky break.

Scam dodging skills:

* Again, don’t be in a hurry. Be methodical. Set your timeline unit in decades. This is a lifetime journey.

* Information is free and easily accessible. No need to pay for courses.

* If IG influencers can make a lot of money using their own advice... why would they share that advice? Just take a pause and triple check their messaging using other sources.

Math skills:

* You don’t need to be a super genius PhD. But you really need to know compounding interest/growth.

* Basic statistics is helpful. This knowledge will help you assess your personal growth year on year.

Basic Money Skills:

* Budgeting is a useful skill but you don’t have to be religious about it. Just be good enough to have a feel of your monthly spending.

* Don’t fear bills. Open that mail and stare at it. You can’t measure what you don’t know.

* Use tools like PersonalCapital or YNAB or Mint to make life easy.

Practical Advice to get started when you are broke, I was a poor immigrant so I get it:

* First, you have income problem. You need to elevate yourself to “real” middle class level (on par to when boomer was middle class), which is somewhere closer to $150k-$200k/year. Who cares about avocado toast or coffee or diaper if the income problem is fixed.

* How? Don’t find shortcuts. Find legitimate careers that can take you there and pivot hard. Being an underpaid teacher won’t take you there. Pivot.

* Now that you are afloat with a decent career, don’t buy that hellcat. Start budgeting and get good at it. But once you have a good feel, no need to be religious about it.

* Get invested ASAP with the typical route: 401k, Roth IRA, personal brokerage. Don’t know what stocks to buy? Just stick to Vanguard brand ETF. Buy VTI or VOO.

Homework for readers:

Do them as soon as possible 

* Open an account on those free budgeting apps:  PersonalCapital, Mint, or YNAB. And start populating the data.

* Setup 401k with your employer if you haven’t.

* Open Roth IRA account on reputable brokerage accounts like Fidelity or eTrade. I personally avoid Robinhood. Start putting in what you can and buy VTI.

Extra: Being an enterpreneur

* You should start a business in a field you already expert in. This way at minimum you bring credibility and clienteles.

* Without any of that, nor capital, then you are just relying on your grit. You better have a lot of grit.

* And if you don't have grit as well? Then you are just dreaming. Time to wake up.

Extra: Home ownership 

* It’s nuanced. Buying is not always an instant win. Cost of ownership is very high. You need to be prepared for it.

* If you stay invested in the stock market, you are already owning assets. No need to rush to buy a house.

* Cost of purchase and sale is very high. It’s annoying. You can’t pivot a house quickly.

* Rental properties are full of headaches too. Don’t believe the IG influencers too much. The math to figure out real profit from rentals is actually hard.",3,1729313825.0,Money,1,1.0,False

1g71gag,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g71gag/mf_3_roses/,[MF] 3 Roses,"Title: ""3 Roses""

Genre:

Drama / Emotional Family Story


Logline:

A man buys three roses during a routine day, intending to gift them to his mother, wife, and daughter, but these simple gestures of love take on a profound meaning, revealing deeper emotions tied to loss and memories.


---

Synopsis:

Ravi, a mid-aged professional, spends an ordinary day at work, focused on his responsibilities. Before leaving his office, he asks his assistant to buy him three roses. On his way home, he gives one rose each to his mother, wife, and daughter. These tender moments of affection reflect Ravi’s bond with his family. But as the day unfolds, the narrative takes a heartbreaking twist, revealing that the roses are meant for the loved ones he has lost. The final scene brings us to a crematorium where Ravi, with tears in his eyes, places the roses on their resting places, highlighting the fragility of life and the weight of memories.


---

Themes:

1. Family Love: The connection between a man and the women in his life—his mother, wife, and daughter—is shown through simple but meaningful gestures.


2. Memory and Loss: The roses, initially presented as acts of love, take on symbolic significance as tributes to those who are no longer with him.


3. Grief and Acceptance: The story portrays how love continues even in the face of loss, as Ravi processes his emotions through the symbolism of the roses.




---

Tone and Style:

Tone: Quietly emotional, intimate, reflective, with moments of lightness in the beginning that transition to poignancy in the climax.

Visual Style: Minimalistic, focusing on natural lighting and warm, homely settings in contrast with the somber, outdoor crematorium scene. The film uses close-ups to highlight emotional subtleties, such as smiles, gestures, and tears.

Pacing: Slow and deliberate, allowing the audience to absorb each moment as it unfolds, building up to the final emotional impact.



---

Detailed Treatment:


---

Act 1: Setting the Routine (Day in the Office)

The film opens with Ravi in his office, a middle-aged professional, calm and methodical in his work. The setting is mundane, reflecting a regular day at the office. There’s a brief moment when Ravi checks the time—it’s 3:30 PM. He calls for his assistant, Shiva, and asks him to get three roses.

Visuals: A mid-shot of Ravi in his formal attire, focused on paperwork, switching to close-ups of his hands signing documents and him looking at the wall clock.

There’s no indication of anything out of the ordinary, and the dialogue between Ravi and Shiva is casual and routine. Shiva leaves to get the roses.



---

Act 2: Acts of Love (The Roses for Family)

Scene 1: Gift to His Mother
Ravi reaches home and heads to the kitchen, where his mother, Savithri, is making coffee. The atmosphere is warm and familiar. He hands her one of the roses, which she happily pins to her hair. Her affectionate response, “Thanks da kanna,” shows the deep bond they share. She smiles with pride and love.

Scene 2: Gift to His Wife
Ravi moves to the living room, where his wife, Rajini, is tidying up. Their interaction is simple and loving. He gives her a rose, and she pins it to her head, acknowledging it with a smile and a “Thank you dear.” The interaction is brief but filled with the intimacy of a long marriage.

Scene 3: Gift to His Daughter
Ravi finds his daughter, Smitha, painting in her room. She excitedly greets him as he enters. Ravi gives her the last rose, and she gleefully pins it to her hair before kissing him on the cheek. This is the most playful and joyful moment in the film.



---

Act 3: The Reveal and Emotional Climax (Memory and Loss)

After these tender moments, the film takes a somber turn. Ravi, standing still in his home, gently rubs his cheek where his daughter kissed him. His smile fades, and tears begin to well up in his eyes. Without saying a word, he walks outside.

Scene: The Crematorium
The audience is taken to an unexpected location—a crematorium. The shift in setting is sudden and stark. The warmth of the home is replaced by the cold reality of loss. Ravi approaches the crematorium, where three urns or memorial stones are visible, each representing his mother, wife, and daughter.

The Three Roses:
The roses now take on a new meaning. In an emotionally charged moment, Ravi places the three roses, one on each memorial. The camera lingers on him as he looks down in silence. His tears flow, but his face remains composed, reflecting a quiet acceptance of his grief.



---

Resolution: The Weight of Memories

The final shot zooms out from Ravi, showing all three roses placed together, symbolizing the unity of his love for his family, even in their absence. The film ends on a poignant note, with Ravi standing alone in contemplation.



---

Characters:

1. Ravi: A 34-year-old man who holds deep affection for his family. He is a quiet, composed individual, but beneath his exterior lies the pain of loss. His character arc shows him processing his grief while maintaining his love.


2. Savithri: Ravi’s mother, a nurturing figure who takes pride in her son. She symbolizes unconditional love.


3. Rajini: Ravi’s wife, who shares a deep bond of partnership and understanding with him.


4. Smitha: Ravi’s daughter, a playful and innocent figure who brings joy to Ravi, even after her passing.




---

Cinematic Elements:

Symbolism of the Roses: Each rose represents a person in Ravi’s life. The gradual reveal that the roses are for his deceased family members is the emotional crux of the story.

Lighting: Warm, soft lighting for the home scenes, transitioning to cooler, more muted tones at the crematorium.

Sound Design: Minimalist, with soft background music that grows more somber as the story progresses. Natural sounds like Ravi’s footsteps and the rustling of leaves add to the realism of the setting.

Dialogue: Sparse, allowing the visuals and actors’ expressions to carry the emotional weight of the story.



---

Production Notes:

Locations: Minimal locations (office, home, and crematorium) make this film easy to shoot with a small budget.

Cast: Only four main characters (Ravi, his mother, wife, and daughter), plus a supporting role for Shiva (the office assistant).

Length: Approximately 4-5 minutes.



---

Conclusion:

""3 Roses"" is a moving short film that captures the complexity of love, memory, and grief through a simple yet powerful narrative. With a small cast and minimal locations, this film can be produced efficiently, yet its emotional impact is profound. The story is built around the subtle interactions between Ravi and his family, with the final reveal adding a deeply emotional punch.

1g71fim,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g71fim/my_mother_hasnt_been_the_same_since_i_found_an/,My mother hasn't been the same since I found an old recipe book,"When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 

It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.

After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.

So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.

The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.

In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of Star Trek figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.

It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.

As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.

The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…

I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt wrong, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.

Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  

As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”

My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.

Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.

In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.

Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  

“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.

“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”

I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 

For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.

Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.

“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.

But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.

When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.

Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.

When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.

“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.

I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.

After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.

The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.

When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.

As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. Mother’s Last Supper Porridge, Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf, Elders’ Emberbread, Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 

Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: Ancestor’s Offering. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.

My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 

The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.

But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as Ancestor’s Salt. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”

I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?

I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.

A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.

I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.

“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”

I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, Ancestor’s Offering. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 

“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.

“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.

For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.

My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called Ancestor’s Salt,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”

The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.

“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.

Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.

I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.

“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”

I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”

I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”

After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled Elders’ Emberbread.

The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 

I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.

I scanned the list of ingredients for Elders’ Emberbread, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.

The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.

By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.

Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 

As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.

When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the Elders’ Emberbread more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.

Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.

The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.

She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.

Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.

After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.

“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”

We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”

Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”

His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”

“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”

“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to his mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”

The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.

“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”

My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.

“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 

A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.

I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described Elders’ Emberbread to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”

I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”

“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”

I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You need to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”

Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.

One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.

I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.

Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, something’s going to happen. You have to believe me.”

And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt off. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.

Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.

When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.

“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”

I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… absent.

Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.

“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.

“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”

Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.

Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.

“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”

I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.

“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”

Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “Sit down and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.

“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”

Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”

I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.

“Don’t go in there. Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.

“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.

“Please,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”

“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.

I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 

The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.

I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.

He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”

I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.

“Stop! Please! Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.

“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”

The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. You have to eat!”

I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.

The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.

Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.

That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.

I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.

Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.

We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.

By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.

My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 

On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.

But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a [hold on me](https://www.reddit.com/u/LCDatkin/s/4WJ14GgqYF).",5,1729313305.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1g71b6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g71b6u/aita_for_feeling_bad_after_my_boyfriend_decided/,AITA for feeling bad after my boyfriend decided not to see me before leaving for a 3-week trip?,"I (F28) have been dating my boyfriend (M32) for 6 months. We met when I was 20 after moving to a new apartment, and he lived next door. At the time, we were at different stages in life, and although I liked him, nothing really happened besides a cordial neighborly relationship (with some flirty vibes). Time passed, and 2 years ago, I moved to the capital of our country (we're not from America, so sorry if my English is weird as it's not my first language). It turns out he moved here soon after for work. We reconnected, went out a few times as friends, and earlier this year, we hit it off. Everything’s been great, and I feel like I’ve found my soulmate. I know it’s early, but we’ve already talked about marriage and kids, and I want it all with him.

Now, back to the present. My boyfriend had planned a trip to Europe with his family (his two parents and a close cousin). He organized everything: plane tickets, hotels, tours. It’s a 3-week trip across multiple countries, and it required a lot of time and added stress to his already hectic life. The main purpose of the trip is to visit relatives on his mom’s side, who are elderly and may not be around much longer, especially for his mom, who is also getting older. It’s also a chance for his parents to visit Europe, something they couldn’t afford when my boyfriend was growing up. So, this is a very special trip for him and his parents, and he wanted it to be perfect. Let me add that this trip has been in the making even before we reconnected.

The past few weeks have been stressful for him, making sure everything was in order, both for the trip and at work, which is already stressful. We both have our own places and usually see each other on weekends. On weekdays, we sometimes work together when our “work from home” schedules align.

Last week, we met on Saturday, went to a restaurant near his place, and walked around the neighborhood. It was a cute, relaxed day. I left on Sunday after we did some grocery shopping together. We made plans to see each other on Friday, as he was leaving on Saturday. On Monday at work, I started feeling like I had a sore throat, and by Tuesday, I was fully sick with a fever, likely from a coworker who had been ill. We talked through chat, but I downplayed how sick I felt because I didn’t want him to worry.

By Wednesday night, I was feeling much better, so I asked him if he wanted to spend Thursday night together and work on Friday, as we had originally planned, because I really missed him. He said he was concerned about catching my illness and passing it to his parents during the trip. I hadn’t even thought of that and felt bad immediately, realizing we wouldn’t see each other before his return. He suggested grabbing coffee on Friday, but I felt upset and told him if he wanted to avoid getting sick, then we shouldn’t meet at all. The idea of meeting without even a hug seemed unrealistic to me. I agreed to respect his decision, but we wouldn’t see each other until after his trip, meaning three weeks. The conversation got a bit tense, and after we hung up, I was disappointed, not just because we wouldn’t meet, but because I had to bring it up in the first place.

After that, things felt bad between us. He called me a few hours later, crying, overwhelmed by everything. I decided to put my feelings aside and comfort him. I didn’t want to add to his stress, so I acted like everything was fine and encouraged him to disconnect and enjoy his trip. He thanked me for being understanding.

We've been talking since, and while I’ve been acting like everything's fine, it still bothers me. It felt like he didn’t find it hard to choose not to see me, and that stung. I know I shouldn’t feel this way, because he’s doing what’s necessary for his trip and to protect his family. But, even understanding his reasoning, it doesn’t stop me from feeling hurt. It just felt like I wasn’t a priority, and that’s difficult to shake off, even though I know he has a lot on his plate right now.

I understand there are certain age differences such as 20 and 40 that are of course weird and maybe concerning, but I'll occasionally see some comment like ""what does a 29 year old man even want in a 23 year old who barely graduated college"" get thousands of likes. A TikTok comment suggesting a 25-21 pairing was ""disgusting"" got hundreds of likes and supportive replies. And recently, on this sub itself, I saw a thread that warned a 24 year old about asking out someone just 4 years younger because apparently that's inappropriate?

I'm gonna downvoted just for admitting this but I'm Canadian. Canada as of now is a shitshow. There's no defence for how fucked up this place has been since 2023. I'm genuinely ashamed to be Canadian these days. And yet, I can confidently say at least here I'm not gonna get McCarthy'd for hitting on someone 4 years younger than me.
