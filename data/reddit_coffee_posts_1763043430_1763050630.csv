Let me be clear: you WILL get disqualified from a lot of surveys. The trick is to not take it personally and just move on to the next one.

I do a couple in the morning with my coffee and a few at night. The payouts are small but real. I just cashed out $10 to my PayPal to confirm it worked, and it was there in under a minute.

1ow5873,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ow5873/clutter_and_grief/,Clutter and grief,"""Grief"" doesn't just mean grieving over the loss of a loved one's life.
""Grief,"" would also mean– to grieve over the loss of ""what could have been."" 
It only stayed a concept; it's not dead. How can you say it's dead, when in the first place, it was never even born into the world of ""reality?"" Hindi naman talaga nangyari? 
The grave is only inside your heart. It only stayed an idea.

Hours or a bit lengthy minutes before, I was writing a previous post. Pero masyadong mahaba yung story I wanted to get off my chest earlier, I believe... So, I'll just set that aside for now once my heart falls and shatters again. That'll all be for another post I guess
 
Originally, umiiyak talaga ako kanina and I had to resort (?) from tears to writing nalang. I mean, why do people write, anyway?

For today, I was trying to fix the rearrangement  of our room, alone. Since it hasn't been cleaned for a long time.
Normally, you'd have that stuff of your room go outside of it first to be able to clean properly. 

Well, medyo attached ako sa isang table na 'to sa labas. How the room was cleaned is also for another story, let's focus on the table hehehehe hahaha

I inspect the room, trying to figure out pano ko ipapasok yung isang table na naiwan sa sala ng bahay– was attempting to find a way to where the hell I'd put it inside our shared bedroom.

Saan ko kaya ilalagay? Beneath the hanging mirror again... Katabi ng cabinet... In front of the brown desk?
Well, I tried to visualize that, tried looking around and re-observing our room again more–
I look beneath the brown tall desk that's been inside our bedroom before I was probably even born as the youngest sa pamilya:
Mga cardboard boxes ng utensils, panluto, plato, ricecooker? Wow, may coffee maker pa. Hell, even teapot– na never nagamit.
I've lived here for my whole life. Never sa tanang buhay ko ay I'd react to such a thing, it was just there, I only acknowledged it once or twice, I believe, I remember. Even if it was in plain sight, no? And you'd wonder why I didn't.

Pero this time, when I looked at those boxes, something hit different.
Like an arrow, pero hindi natamaan puso ko in a romantic way.
Parang may arrow na tumusok sa utak ko, then it hit:

A realization and reminder, to me, that my father bought those for us, for our own whole family of four (mother, father, sister, me) and that yung mga gamit na yun, supposedly nailipat na sa sarili naming bahay, at magagamit naming apat.

But that never happened.

Kahit ""nagkaroon kami ng sariling bahay"" sa ibang city, my family had finally fallen apart just while inaayos yung bahay na yun. How my family fell apart is even complex, personally, as the youngest daughter. Writing an essay, or two, probably wouldn't be enough. I'd end up writing multiple chapters of a book from what I've gotten from their sides, and what I experienced myself.

It would be useless na subukang ilipat ngayon yung mga gamit na yun because our family fell apart and fatefully separated, after extended years of conflict.
Yes, being able to have bought ""a house,"" but the family is so messed up. And now, not even my father would claim to own the home, personally. Wala na ngang nakatira dun, no?

Yung mga binili niya just ends up being clutter sa kwarto namin. I mean, even the family of four itself just reduced to two. Just me, and my father.

Now those cardboard boxes will now serve as a reminder for me of:
""What if hindi nagkamali yung magulang ko, siguro, may sarili kaming bahay at nakatakas yung tatay ko sa toxic parents niya?
""What if, nailipat na namin yung mga gamit na 'to at magagamit na namin sa sarili naming bahay bilang pamilya?""

Ngayon, ang tanging ""clutter"" lang sa kwarto namin ay naging reminder of all the shortcomings na ginawa ng parents ko.

We can't even use it here. Our extended family is just as equally toxic. I wish my parents bought our own home before making a family of me and my sister.

I grieve over the loss of ""what could have been."" 
If my family wasn't so complex, complicated, and problematic, I definitely would have been a better person today.
Someday, I'll be able to tell my full story and hopefully ""fix the reputation of every one"" even if it's not my responsibility. I want people to understand, 
""We are really complex, are we?"" 

Maybe someday, kung nag-mature na 'ko fully and I'll be able to have my own living place, ako nalang gagamit. Kahit medyo marami-rami ilipat...
Maybe if I'll heal from my own hurt once I'm older.

But I still won't ever forget the story these boxes told.",1,1763050476.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False
1ow582l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ow582l,Long read. Sharing my Itinerary after getting lots of help from this sub,"Just wrapped up my Patagonia experience. I've taken a lot of advice from this sub since I booked my trip back in April so wanted to say thanks and share my experience in case it helps others.

I have to start this post by saying we were extremely lucky with the November weather all throughout our 2 weeks in Chile. We barley got any rain and lots of sun.

We (couple, 39M, 36F) travelled from the Uk via Madrid with Iberia (user the Amex 2 for 1 voucher) and also spent some time in Chiloe and around Puerto Varas before heading to Puerto Natales. We had a great time in the lakes area, I won't go into details in this sub but if anyone has any questions I'm happy to answer.

Itinerary 

Day 0 (arrival in Puerto Natales)
Day 1 - drive to park, glacier grey boat tour
Day 2 - base Torres hike
Day 3 - Ferrier and condor
Day 4 - cuernos lookout and Lago Torre hike
Day 5 - drive back, Laguna Sofia hike

Getting to PN
We flew with Sky Airlines from Puerto Montt to Puerto Natales, experience was totally fine. We landed in PN around 1.30 pm. We took the transport vans that cost 4000 CLP to drop you and other to their hotels in town. You can't miss their counters where you pick up your luggage.


Car rental 
I had arranged car rental with LYS, I booked back in June. I chose them based on the positive comments in this sub. That all worked out great. They are kind of a rental broker and arranged the car via Europcar. That Europcar car franchise has now become a Sixt. When I did need some advice on where to repair a punctures tyre in the park Andres from Lys was very responsive on Whatsapp. Had an immediate tire pressure warning right outside Puerto Natales (PN) after picking up a Subaru Crosstrek from Sixt. Managed to go back and swap the car before hitting the road.

Cost was 360usd, half paid in advance when booking, half when returning the car. They take a 700,000 clp deposit on your credit card while you have the car.

Driving experience 
Driving in town will be second nature to US drivers but I'm not so used to driving grid layouts with one way streets, pay attention to the arrows on the brown signs at each crossroads! I immediately made a fool of myself and got lucky turing left when I shouldn't have.

The roads in the park are gravel with occasional paving. The gravel is in decent condition with some bad patches. The bigger potholes are actually on the paved road into the park. The area around Pehoe was the busiest and windy and narrow at times.

Once in the park you'll generally go between 30-60kmph. I used 3/4 of my tank in our 5 days driving. You can coast the downhills a lot to be more efficient with your petrol. There are 2 petrol stations in PN. None in the park or on the way.

Flat Tire on Y-290: Got a flat tire about 40km down the Y-290 (the road leading to the park entrance). Hotel Rio Serrano has a mechanic on-site who can repair tires! Saved us a long trip back to PN.
Cost: 25,000 CLP (paid at reception) + tip 


Accomodation 
We stayed the first night in town at Hotel Vendeval. The staff were really nice and breakfast (mediocre) was included. They don't have a lift but will help with luggage. The room was a nice but not big enough to lie open 2 suitcases.

First two nights in the park we stayed at Konkashken Lodge. It's nicely set up, the cabin was spacious. The cabin does get cold at night (out of the bed) so you will want to keep the wood stove going. They charge $18 for Breakfast and $45 for dinner, but given that 2 nights there is expensive we brought our own supplies for dinner and breakfast. I booked well in advance on booking.com. Patrick the owner was very kind to help us reschedule our glacier tour to the later afternoon as a result of our delay dealing with the flat tire and it turned out the road was closed for a few hours while a marathon was taking place. They have a lovely sunset view point. 

Second two nights in the park we stayed at Hosteria Pehoe. It's a well cared for little island. The rooms are as dated as they look in the pictures but the mattress looked very new and we slept well. Breakfast is included in the price and isn't bad. I booked that directly on their site several months in advance.

While in the park I did look on booking.com to see what was available last minute. There were a few options in Rio Serrano and Pehoe. Maybe could have saved a few quid.

Because we were lucky with the weather I felt like we would have been fine with only 3 nights in the park. If I was going again I would not be averse to mixing up with some nights in PN and some the park, night in, night out kind of thing. We only saved 20 mins on the drive from Rio Serrano to Las Torres versus the drive from PN for example.

On our final night in PN we stayed in DT Loft. This was the best equipped studio style hotel I've ever stayed in. The kitchen had everything. If using PN as a base I'd recommend this place.

Treks
We (39M, 36F) are not avid hikers but have done our share. 

BASE TORRES - 8 hours with breaks
The weather forecast was so good (clear skies, 18c) that we decided to do this first. We drove from Rio Serrano and were passing the visitor centre by 7.30. The centre and its toilets don't open till 8am. Our goal, thanks to the advice of this sub was to get out before many of the tour buses.

The first 45 mins or so is tough, we were hot already, I could have left a layer in the car. The windy valley was not so windy and lovely walk to chileno. We stopped there to eat some snacks. It costs 2000clp to use the bano if needed. 

The next hour or so it nice and flat through the woods.

Before the base climb there is a bano nearby at the Conaf centre, wish I had known that!

Base climb was tough in the heat, I switched from trousers to shorts on the way up, should have done that way earlier.

We stayed about 30 mins at the top, it was getting busier and busier while we were there.
We had to give way to a few big guided groups on the way down.

Plenty of water available during the trek. Can of coke as a reward and the end of the trek costs 3500CLP at the visitor centre.

FERRIER - 3 hours with 20 mins on top
Short but steep. We started at about 11.30. It was surprisingly quiet, probably only passed a dozen others up and down. You sign in before going up. It's quite a step based climb for the most part. Very windy on the top.

CONDOR - 30 mins up
We did this as a bit of a loop in the evening, starting at Hosteria Pehoe, coming down by camping pehoe and getting dinner there. 

SALTO Grande and CUERNOS
No hills here all flat. It started out very windy near the car park but it died down a lot by the time we returned. It's a really nice viewpoint, quite busy with guided tour groups. Keep an eye out for some cool flowers called Darwin's slippers.

LAGO TORO
This one was a bit unplanned, because we had such great weather we had done the main day treks and I didn't fancy driving to Laguna Azul and back. It was a great hike. We climbed from the parking to the Mirador. This is very steep but in a different way to the steepness of Ferrier or Base Torres, I didn't find it as energy sapping as those. Much of the track is shale rock so you can manage your steps much better and poles are helpful. Very windy at the Mirador. It takes about an hour to get up. We had plenty more time so we decided to follow the trail that leads to the porteria at Laguna Verde. We made it to Laguna Honda and then headed back. It's really flat to there and a really nice trek through a kind of valley sheltered from the wind and through some woods. Highly recommend! The descent from Mirador was fun, the closest I got to downhill skiing!

LAGUNA SOFIA - cerro benitez, outside the park, 25km from PN.
I didn't want to drive from Pehoe to Laguna Azul so we found this trek near PN. It's a steep climb first up a first track in a farm field then more rocky terrain. We got a great view of condors flying right by us near the top. Weather was mixed this day, our only trek with a bit of drizzle but also plenty of sun.

Gear
- Salomon trekking shoes (not boots) I've had for years
- Merino wool socks 
- Patagonia terravia peak pants (too warm for the best of the weather)
- base layer for the cooler days, t-shirt for base Torres
- Fjallraven fleece zip with hood (should have left in the car for base Torres)
- Patagonia wind/rain jacket
- buff, good for keeping ears warm when windy
- poles
- sunscreen, Don't forget your hands when using poles!
- lip balm
- 
didn't need my puffer vest or rain overpants.

Wildlife
Saw the 🦙, a few hares, no shortage of upland geese 🪿. No Pumas but we didn't spend time in the amarga area where I believe sightings are most common.


Food 
In Puerto Natales we then went for lunch at Santolla twice , again based on positive comments in this sub. It was delicious. King crab tapas and scallops. We also got a coffee in Holaste because we were attracted to all the awards in display, they definitely know what they are doing but I actually didn't like their roast. I could have been the oat milk but it was on the fruity side rather than the chocolate side.

We went for dinner in the Baguales brewpub. I would avoid this, worst meal we had on the trip. Their beer is ok.

On our last night we went to the last hope distillery cocktail bar. The experience of waiting in the cold at the closed door to get in is a little humiliating, but once in there I was impressed at the cocktails and they have cheesboards and empanadas that are really good value.

We stocked up on a few supplies in the Unimarc before we went into the park. Lunch in the park was mainly trail mix and protein bars.

While staying at Hosteria Pehoe we are one night at the restaurant down the road at camping Pehoe. Their menu is very basic but, I love wood fired cooking, it was 60 CLP for Steak, salmon, boiled potatoes and two glasses of Carmenere.  The second night we ate at Hosteria Pehoe. Reviews of their restaurant seem more miss than hit so we were skeptical, especially for the price, a set menu for $55 per person. Strangely it's the exact same menu for lunch but the price is $45... The set menu included a small starter, main, dessert, a soft drink and a glass of wine. Civiche starter was fine. I had lomo saltado and my partner had hake and we both really enjoyed it. I did see some other guests who didn't appear to be enjoying their pasta/gnocchi.

Argentina side v Chile side
I visited El calafete and El Chalten back in feb 2017 on a south America backpacking trip. I have really fond memories of El Chalten. The way all the trails run from the town is so great and removes the need for car rental etc. Puerto Natales is a cool town though with a lot of quality food options, just a pity it's not 100km further north!

I definitely wouldn't pay $350 a night x4 to stay in the park again. ",1,1763050468.0,Patagonia,0,1.0,False
1ow577w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1ow577w/help_coming_from_manual_budget_to_ynab/,Help - Coming from manual budget to YNAB,"Hi all,

Yesterday I started using YNAB as apparently it is the best budgeting app.

**Where I come from**: I'm no matter whatsoever new in budgeting, for the last 6 years, I've been using Excel to have the bigger picture of where my money is coming and going, in a monthly and bi-weekly basis. Also using a simple app called BlueCoins that I use to track my daily spending, and know how much do I owe to my credit cards, and why/where they were there in the first place, with proper categorization, timing and account assignation.

**My current system works as follows:** When I get paid, I go to my Excel spreadsheet and see how much I need to send to my checking accounts and why. After that, those specific amounts are budgeted in different categories, from then I spend the money and update a tab on my Excel to know how much money I have left for each category. i.e.: If I set $100 to guilt-free money this week (that can include a coffee, beer, an uber ride, etc.) and I spend $4 in a coffee, I add those $4 to a table and it tells me that I have $94 left for that week, and I assign an ID to those $4, if they were paid with a CC, therefore when I pay my CC at the end of the week, I know which transaction I am paying for.

**Why I want to use YNAB:** Apparently all of this manual process that I do daily, can be easily automated in YNAB using linked accounts, where everything is categorized AND also I can set my weekly groceries money to a cute and useful category with visual cues on how it's going.

After all that context, here's where I need help.

* Accounts (Checking/Saving/CC,etc) - They don't post new transactions automatically, and that defeats the whole purpose of having an expense tracker, I don't mind if they are pending or posted, I would like to see them as they were made. And It's not happening on my end, no idea if it's an issue.
* How to set up a fixed amount for a period of time in a category group - For example, I can set up $100 for my weekly guilt-free spending, that can be whatever, it's not realistic, at least for me, set up a weekly budget of $5-$10 just for coffee, not all weeks are equal, but what is constant is my set amount to spend that week on all categories in that category group have to be less than the amount I set for the week. (Which I can do in BlueCoins)
* Untracked accounts - I want to see the amount of my savings account but I don't want it to count in my ready to use money, that's why I set up a untracked account for my Savings but I can't make transfers to that account. Don't know how to approach that.

  
I watched a lot of videos regarding YNAB and can't find solutions or ways to work on my issues around.

I appreciate any input or ideas, I really want to use this app cause I'm tired of doing it manually and also don't want to pay $100 yearly just to have a better UI and none of the automatic benefits.

Thanks beforehand",1,1763050417.0,ynab,0,1.0,False

I work full time, so there's that as well.  

So, I just learned (read it in a few different studies & atricles) that levothyroxine in LIQUID form does NOT cause any of the interactions that we have to navigate when taking the tablet form. 

Docs prescribe the tablets, despite all the known problems/interactions, knowing most patients dont take it properly (1 hour apart from ANY food, including coffee, and 4 hours apart from other meds and supplements).

I want to take calcium as close to every 8 hours as I can. Finding a time to take my levothyroxine that is 4 hrs from calcium dose AND 1 hour from any food/coffee is so difficult.  Id love to be on the liquid form of levo. but apparently many insurance companies won't pay for it.

How utterly insane this is.  There is a simple solution to for millions of people who fail or struggle to comply with recommendations - the liquid form instead of tablets. 

I guess this is more if a rant than anything else.  I would love to hear from anyone who has found a solution to thus particular problem. Thank you. ",1,1763050392.0,osteoporosis,0,1.0,False

I’m a freelance barista and sometimes get messages from different coffee shops asking if I’m available to cover a shift. I’d love to find an app (something like Calendly) where cafés could just pick a time slot and book me directly.

Calendly only really works for short meetings, but I’d need something that allows:

* longer time slots like half or full day shifts
* the employer to leave their café address and a few notes
* automatic updates to my availability

Has anyone found a good tool for this kind of setup? Or maybe a workaround that does the job?

Now without further ado, here's how we did yesterday!

 **Player Props squad, you got the sweep (3/3) 🧹🔥** I'd actually sent out 4, but Banchero got voided (thankfully). For those curious, here's what the Prop bettors had:

 

**Player Props (3/3) 🎉**

\-CLE Cavaliers v MIA Heat: Jarrett Allen Over 16.5 Points (-125) ✅

\-CLE Cavaliers v MIA Heat: Norman Powell Over 23.5 Points (-110) ✅

\-GS Warriors v SA Spurs: Victor Wembanyama Over 40.5 Points, Rebounds & Assists (-110) ✅

\-ORL Magic v NY Knicks: Paolo Banchero Over 35.5 Points, Rebounds & Assists (-120) 🟨 (VOID)

 

\----

As for picks, I'm outraged to report that **the SA Spurs caved to the Golden State Warriors;** they started off super strong, but ultimately, the constant fouling really set them back. In short: *Pick of the Day* wound up being a miss.

 Despite missing a number of key components in their starting lineup, the Cavaliers spanked the Miami Heat, and cashed our Over for us (**CLE Cavaliers v MIA Heat Over 238.5 ✅)**

Picks finished the night 1/4, but thankfully, Prop success kept our day afloat 😌☕️

That's all for now! Sit tight, Reddit friends – I'll have today's *Pick of the Day* down the pipes shortly.

**Room 317**



  Chapter 1: Impact



   One second I was changing the station on the radio, glancing at the pine trees around me. The next I was surrounded by flashing lights and wailing sirens. I try to open my eyes but all I see are blurs of different colors. Without warning, I feel a pain shoot through my head as I instinctively lift my head up until I realize how little strength I really had. I look to my left with what little vision I still had left and see an indistinct figure trying to pry open the door that looked like it had gone through a metal compressor. I noticed my eyes start to drift off, but I didn’t let them, I had to stay awake. 

   Suddenly, I notice the things around me, broken glass, pieces or metal, a spilled coffee cup that had been emptied a long time ago. While still stuck in my current position, I try to hear what the blurs of blue and red are saying, but all I could make out was a few words, “Don’t…dangerous…try harder…” and then everything went silent. Was I dying? Was I already dead? I didn’t know, but the last thing I noticed before my vision went completely black was how close the ground suddenly looked, and how far away I suddenly felt. 



Chapter 2: Unheard



**June 1 - 2025   (6:55)**

   **I woke up today feeling even stranger than the day before. Like something was- off, but I wasn’t sure what. My days have gotten better recently, but everything is still happening. I talked to Mr. Crown yesterday, and he gave me a new medication. He says this will help this time, but he’s said that the last 5 times. Anyways, I just woke up so I’m going to go brush my teeth. Thank you for being there for me.**

**Sincerely**

* **Vincent Road**



   The first thing I did was grab the little orange container with the white lid and popped two pills in my mouth. Mr. Crown said these would help, I hope he’s right.

   I grab my tooth brush and wet the bristles. Some people don’t wet their toothbrush before squeezing on the toothpaste, I personally don’t like to associate with those people. I squeeze the toothpaste on to my toothbrush and start brushing my teeth as water drips into my stubble on my chin, and then down my neck. 

   Suddenly, I hear a whisper, gibberish, but a voice nonetheless. I’ve gotten used to them by now so they don’t affect me. 

   I just go on brushing my teeth while still hearing a whisper in my ear even though I live alone and have lived alone for the past 3 years.

  When I finish brushing my teeth, I open the drawer in the vanity and grab a hairbrush and start styling my hair. Everyone tells my I always have bed head, and I really do try to fix it, but it just goes back to that messy, dark brown birds nest that everyone loves to comment on. It’s not even to my shoulders and it’s somehow always the biggest hair in the room. 

   As I comb my hair back, trying to to tame it, I suddenly hear water dripping. I instinctively think it’s the sink, but the sink isn’t dripping, this sink NEVER drips. Confused, I set the brush down onto my polished sink and walk down the dark hallway into my kitchen to see if that’s where the suspicious noise is coming from. I peek around the corner, and not to my surprise, nothing. The sink wasn’t dripping, not even a drop. I stand there in silence for minutes too long to count. 

   I knew this was going to happen, but I was hoping that maybe, *just maybe,* today would be different. This isn’t the first time this has happened. I’m always hearing sounds, noises, voices, that no one else can. I’ve tried to talk to people about them. I’ve talked to my friend, my co workers, my boss, but I just get hit with the same response, “I’ve told you already, you’re crazy Vincent!” No compassion, no TRYING to understand, just a term that is used to loosely nowadays, but I’ve gotten used to it. I head to my room, disregarding my hairbrush because it’s not like it’ll help, and open my dresser drawer to get dressed for work. I knew I wasn’t crazy, I knew I heard what I heard, saw what I saw, felt what I felt. I’ve tried to convince myself it was nothing, but ever since that day I heard my name whispered, I’ve never truly believed it.



Chapter 3; Lunch Break



**June 1- 2025   (8:37)**

   **I just got to work. I was late because I heard the sound again, the sound that Mr. Crown told me was “normal,” as if anything about me was normal anymore. I didn’t know what that meant, but I knew he was wrong the second I heard it. I’ve already told you what it was, but I need to say it again. Mr. Crown gave me you for that reason. It’s like, a weird beeping sound coming from inside of me. Sometimes it’s quiet, sometimes it’s so loud I can’t hear anything else (that’s why I overcooked the pizza yesterday. I couldn’t hear the oven beeping). I don’t know why I told you that, but I did.** 

  **I hope I have a good day today at the store. Being a mechanic isn’t my favorite job, the only one I’ve ever had. I’m not even a real mechanic, I just grab parts for people who actually know what they’re doing. I hope I see Lucy today at least. She’s my best friend. She calls me handsome when I’m having a bad day. Well, that’s all for today. As always, thank you for being there for me.**

**Sincerely**

   It was about 12:00 pm when I left for my lunch break. I left the cold, dingy concrete room full of things I knew nothing about and went to the much more comforting back room. It was a small room with a small wooden table, 2 wooden chairs in front of it that looked old enough to have had a caveman sit in them, a poster of a car I didn’t know the name of, and an old grey carpet stained with oil and anything else it would pick up. It wasn’t clean, it wasn’t spotless, but it comforting. The stone walls really cornered in the atmosphere, even if I knew it wasn’t real stone. 

  I walked over to the corner of the room and grabbed my lunchbox that I had set there when I got to work and sat down in one of the older chairs. It tilted to the side when I sat down and I braced myself against the table, scared it would fall, it didn’t, barely. My lunchbox was set down on the table with a thud and I started grabbing things out of it. 

   I had barely pulled out my signature peanut butter and jelly sandwich with the crust cut off and the sandwich cut off into 4 perfect squares when suddenly I heard the beeping again. Louder than it had *ever been.* I dropped the plastic bag back into my lunchbox and curled my large hands around my ears, “Not now,” I thought, “Not my lunch break,” but it continued. The world around me seemed to get smaller by the minute as my only focus was the sound blaring in my ears. It felt like my heartbeat was plugged into an amp and turned all the way up in headphones only I could hear.  

   I shakily stood up, knocking the chair over accidentally, and stumbled over and locked the door so no one could see me in this state. I didn’t need anyone to see me like this, not again, because I wasn’t dealing with fake sympathy today.

I sat down against the door for what felt like hours looked at my watch and squinted and looked at the time, and my hands shook when I realized what time it was. “12:45?! No no no no no, my boss must be looking for me. Mr. Crown told me the meds would take it away- they were supposed to deal this. He *promised* me. He ALWAYS PROMISES ME.” 

   All of a sudden, I feel a violent bang on the door. I know who it is. I know EXACTLY who it is, but I can’t let him see me, not like this. I stand up, hands still cradling my ears as I gently remove one to unlock the door and then put it right back to the side of my head. I see my boss, I see his mouth moving wide as he talks, or yells, his eyebrows twitching angrily, his stance screaming furious. I stand there feeling pathetic, again. The beeping hasn’t stopped, if anything it’s gotten worse. I try to listen to my boss. I try to make out his words, but when he tried to pull my hands away from my ears, I acted out of pure instinct and slapped his hand away.

   His face is PURE DISBELIEF. His mouth hung open, his eyes were so wide I thought they were gonna fly away, but most of all, his fists were clenched. My hands still cover my ears as my eyes start to well up. I was pathetic. I looked like a toddler who was getting yelled at for breaking something. I’m a 21 year-old man, I’m not supposed to act like this. I’m supposed to be normal, to be able to maintain a job without having to lock myself in a room, to able to to not have to worry about if the “beeping” or “whispers” or “dripping” are coming, to able to *function* in life itself without wondering what makes me so different from everyone else. I shouldn’t have to see a therapist about something that nobody else knows exists. 

   I don’t know what happened after that, whether I black out, disassociated, hell I couldn’t tell you, but what I could tell you was I was no longer working as a mechanic, handing tools to people who knew what they were doing, so I did what I always do when things get to hard, I went to see Mr. Crown. I didn’t realize that would be the last time I ever would.

  


Chapter 4: Everything, Mr. Crown



**June 1- 2025    (1: 34)**

   **Hello again, I just got to Mr. Crown’s office. He told me to tell you about my day so far so he can read it. I’m not going to lie, because lying has never worked in the past. The truth always comes out eventually.. When you read this, hi Mr. Crown, I hope you’re proud of me for taking my meds today. They didn’t help me though, so why is that?**

   **Anyways, I didn’t see Lucy today. I was upset when I realized that on my way here. I must’ve just been so caught up in work, the work I can’t do anymore. I really did try to hear the boss talking, I really did Mr. Crown. It’s just the beeping was so loud. I** ***tried*** **hear him Mr. Crown, but the beeping was louder than him, it always is. Right now I hear whispers, gibberish as always, but still whispers. Mr. Crown, just between me and you, why is this happening to me? I’ve done nothing but good by whole life and have gotten nothing but hell for it. Actually, something else happened today, which is why I’m late, sorry about that sir. I debated on telling you, but you usually know what to do, even if it doesn’t always help. I just wanted someone to understand. I was driving like a normal person would. I finally felt like there wasn’t something WRONG with me, until I suddenly heard a VERY loud siren. I don’t know what kind it was, but it was really loud Mr. Crown.**

   **I just didn’t know if you’d want to know, because you tell me to tell you everything, so I’m telling you now Mr. Crown. I hope you will have a way to fix it again.** 

   **I thought about Lucy again when I got to work. She’s my best friend. She listens to me, and talks to me, and she doesn’t make me feel bad for just existing. You tell me that she doesn’t actually help me Mr. Crown, but she really does, but the more meds I take, the less I see her Mr. Crown. Please change the formula because I can’t live without her, I can’t live without Lucy. I haven’t seen her red cross on her jacket in a while, and I hope to see it again soon. I hope you till take that into consideration when you read this.** 

   **I heard the whispers again this morning Mr. Crown, and the dripping. The meds aren’t helping again, they’re making it worse, and I can’t see Lucy very much anymore. They really did help at first, but now they aren’t Mr. Crown. I brushed my hair, or at least I tried, but it constantly looks bad and I don’t like when people make fun of it, even though I try to laugh, but it still hurts. I hope you will take this well Mr. Crown. Thank you for being there for me.**

**Sincerely**

Chapter 5: The One Who Watches



   I had just left Mr. Crown’s office when I got into my car and pulled out of the parking lot. As I drove down the old, cracked road, I really took it all in. This was my favorite road in the entire world, and not just because it was after Mr. Crown’s house. It had green pine trees in perfect lines down each side of the road, adorable little animals anywhere you looked, cracks in the world that looked like the world was going to open up if they were any wider, and something about this specific long line of pavement felt something I don’t feel anywhere else… familiar. I pulled over to my usual spot, by the biggest pine tree of them all. The large, towering, dark green plant had a huge dent in the front of it. Nobody knows where it came from, it’s like it was just grown like that, but I can never shake the feeling of familiarity this spot gives me. I always stop here after seeing Mr. Crown, it’s one of my only safe places in this god forsaken world where there’s no one to judge me. 

   Without warning, I see a faint figure out of the corner of my eye sitting against the tree. I could’ve *swore* it wasn’t there before. At first I got nervous, but then recognition filled my senses. The same latex smell, the same wavy, dark brown, transparent hair that flowed down to the small of her back, the same green eyes I could never forget, and the same damn red cross on her blue jacket, it was Lucy. I bolted over to her and sat beside her. I was the most excited I have been in weeks. I haven’t seen Lucy in forever. She smiled at me, she always smiled at me, it made me feel nice inside. Lucy never talked, she didn’t have to. I always knew what she wanted to say. It was like we had those cool telepathic brain links you see on tv. 

   “Hello Lucy,” I say, trying my best to not sound like my heart was beating out of my chest. 

   I knew Mr. Crown was wrong; I knew Lucy was good for me. Mr. Crown never smiled at me like she did. He smiled like he had bad news to tell me but hid it behind a too wide smile with pearly white teeth, not but not Lucy. Lucy smiled at me like she knew what I was feeling, and she could make it go away. Lucy didn’t talk to me today, verbally or telepathically, which was strange but I didn’t push her. Sometimes she didn’t talk, but today I noticed something else. Lucy was crying, and Lucy *never* cried.

   “Lucy, are you ok? What’s wrong?”

   She responded in that same whispery tone that no one else could pull off.

   “I-I’m ok Vinny, really. It’s just… you did so good today with your journals.”

That’s when it hit me, I haven’t journaled since Mr. Crowns office! I told Lucy I’d be back, and ran to my car to get my journal and my pen, ran back over, and sat right back down beside Lucy, and I journaled.

   

   **June 1- 2025   (2:17)**

   **Hello! I know I’m not talking to anyone, but I’m so excited! I saw Lucy today! Sorry, I didn’t mean to yell like that. I’m 21, I shouldn’t be this excited over anything anymore, but I can’t help it! I finally saw Lucy again today. I’m, going to keep it short so we can continue talking, but I’m so happy right now, my HAND is shaking. Thank you for being there for me.**

**Sincerely**

* **Vincent Road**



   I set my journal and pen down and looked at Lucy again. She was still crying, but I wasn’t worried anymore, she said I did so good today. It meant a lot more when she said it than when Mr. Crown. Said it. I didn’t speak about Mr. Crown with Lucy, she doesn’t like him, but that’s ok, because I like Mr. Crown, even if Lucy is better. Lucy looked at me, and I knew that look, she had to leave again. I waved good bye with the biggest smile I could muster and she disappeared, floated away in the wind. I don’t care what Mr. Crown said- I feel a lot better with Lucy than I do with him, even if he says she doesn’t exist.



Chapter 6: Blurring Line



**June 1- 2025   (3:19)**

   **I just got home after a long day. I saw Lucy AND Mr. Crown today, which doesn’t happen much anymore. Lucy cried today, which I didn’t like, but it happened anyways. She said she was fine, and I believed her. Lucy doesn’t lie to me.** 

   **Mr. Crown’s today was ok. I just wrote in my journal as usual. I have to go back at 7 pm to go see him to talk about what I wrote. He read it, but didn’t say anything, just just handed it back to me and said to “be back at 7 pm sharp”. Mr. Crown is very strict on times. He told me to take my meds again, so I took another two when I got home a few minutes ago. The whispers are back, the beeping is still going but quieter, the dripping happened as soon as I walked in, but I’m used to it now. One thing that happened was the sirens. I already told Mr. Crown this in my previous entry, but I thought I’d bring it up again. That’s all for now, anyways, thank you for being there for me.**

**Sincerely**

* **Vincent Road**



Chapter 7: June-



   I set my journal and my pen down on my living room table as I sat on the couch in my apartment. I have had a pretty good day today, so I hope that doesn’t change. All of a sudden, something happened to me that has *never* happened to me previous to this moment. My hands SHOT UP to my head, grabbing, pulling at my hair as I suddenly got the worst head ache of my entire life. I squeezed my eyes shut as if that would’ve helped anything. I slide off the couch onto my knees, huddled in a ball, hands still in my hair. My head was pounding from the inside, like the beeping, but worse… so much worse.

  Confusion surrounded me as I lied there, helpless, “What- is happening!?” I couldn’t make sense of it. Maybe it was because I wasn’t thinking right, maybe it was because I was on the floor feeling like my head just got smashed by a sledgehammer, but none of those felt right.

   Without warning, my eyes burst open, and I wasn’t in my living room anymore, I wasn't staring at my old tv anymore, I wasn’t sitting on my soft, gray couch, and I wasn’t in the air conditioning that caused a cold sensation to brush my skin every few minutes. No, not at all, I was in a car, but it wasn’t my car. The windows were smashed, my seat belt was stuck, I was stuck, my vision was blurry, I could barely hear, I could barely see, and my head was hurting even worse, not like a head ache, like an injury. 

  Terrified, I tried to move, but pure *pain SHOT up* my ribs, my head, and my right arm that looked crushed beneath me. I was drifting off, but I couldn’t, I don’t even know why I couldn’t. Why was I here? How did I get here? Suddenly, I see someone, and I swear my heart skipped multiple beats as my breath hitched, or what little breath I still had left. The same dark hair, the same grey eyes, the same red cross, the same blue jacket, but she wasn’t transparent anymore, she was real, and it was Lucy. She looked distressed, HIGHLY distressed while trying to pry open the smashed in car door. I wanted to say something, anything, but I couldn’t. 

   Without warning, my hands went numb, I couldn’t hear anything, I could BARELY see, I didn’t even see Lucy anymore, just a blue of colors like smeared paint on a canvas. The last thing I remembered was being grabbed and put on the ground, then everything went dark. 

  

   **June 1 2025 I don’t know what time**

   **Hi, hello, sorry for not writing this in usual format but I’m TERRIFIED. I just had a vision- or a memory- or a something, I don’t know what it was. I was in a car, then I felt stuck, then I saw Lucy, and she was trying to get the door open, and then it felt like I died but I woke up and now I’m here and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what’s happening and I don’t know what time it is but I’m going to see Mr. Crown.**

* **Vincent**



   My heart was pounding out of my chest as I drove to see Mr. Crown, but on the way, something makes me stop. I get to the road with the pine trees, the animals, and everything else, my favorite road, but somethings different now. As soon as I made the left turn onto the cracked pavement, a feeling of recognition flowed through me like it never has before.

   All of a sudden, the whispers were louder than they ever have been, feeling breath against my skin. The beeping was pounding inside of my head, worse than with my boss. The sirens were wailing in my ears like an emergency, or a warning. I felt trapped in my own mind. I’ve felt this way before, but NEVER like this.

   I quickly swerved and skidded to a stop on the side of the road, my head fell against the steering wheel as I clutched my head, hoping, praying out loud to just make everything *stop.*

“Please, please god DAMMIT PLEASE STOP!” I yelled into the dark void that was now my car, or what felt like an eternal hell at this moment. Suddenly, I looked around. I was pulled over obviously, but right beside me was my favorite tree, the large, dark green pine tree with the mysterious dent… but it didn’t seem so mysterious anymore.

   The memory, vision, whatever the hell is was flooded my senses again, one second I was praying for this hell on earth to be over, the next I was in the car again, stuck, bruised, bloodied, blurry vision, trembling. I suddenly felt a pull on my head, like a string pulling me to look somewhere. I glanced in front of me and I saw it. My breath caught, my hands shook, my eyes darted around, suddenly able to see again clearly. There were police cars, ambulances, Lucy trying to yank my door open, but in front of me, was the pine tree. The same pine tree- before I could take it all in, I was back to reality.

   Now I was in my car still, everything, the whispers, the beeping, the dripping, the everything was the *worst it’s EVER been.* I stared at the dark green pine tree. I stared, unblinking for so long it felt like my eyes were so dry they’d turn to dust and fly away in the slight breeze now happening. That dent, that DAMN dent, I caused that. It was my fault, my car, my accident, my bad driving, my dumbness, my stupidity, but wait. That’s not possible. 

  I crash like that would’ve killed me



**June- 20-**

**“Sorry for not writing, in the usual format, but I’m TERRIFIED”**



Without warning, my journal entries started flooding my head. Why am I sorry, I WAS terrified, what I wrong with me. I try to think logically, but the whispers cause a breathing against my skin

“Get out, get out, GET OUT OF MY HEAD”



**June-**

**“Mr. Crown is very strict on times. He told me to take my meds again-”**



  Mr. Crown- what does he know. Did he know about this? Is this even right? Why did I take meds? Why did he give me a journal? Is he real? Mr. Crown HAS to be real. Mr. Crown helped me- no he didn’t- yes he did. I GRABBED my hair and start yanking. I didn’t know why, for once, I just did. I yanked until I saw strands of dark brown hair in my heads in uneven pieces.

“Please, please, Mr. Crown did you know? Can you hear me? DID YOU KNOW?”



**Ju**

**“I just got to work. I was late because I heard the sound again.”**



   “Work, work work work work work. I DID WORKED. I TRIED TO WORK. I tried to make a living, I TRIED to be ok, to be normal, even though I didn’t know what the hell I was doing- AT LEAST I TRIED. The beeping, that damn sound. I TRIED TO MAKE IT GO AWAY BOSS. BOSS I REALLY DID.”

  I was a pathetic mess again. I screamed, wailed, thrashed in my car BEGGING for an answer, BEGGING for forgiveness for something I couldn’t control, BEGGING to get out of this reality where I don’t know what’s real anymore. 

  The beeping is still here, *on top* of the siren. Is was a miracle my ear drums hadn’t burst yet. Was the sound even real *for* my ear drums to burst? 



**“Lucy was crying”**



  That was when time stopped, as still as it could possible be in this moment, Lucy, dear Lucy. Lucy had always helped me. She’d made me smile when no one else did. I always felt her when I was writing in my journals. Lucy was always there for me.

   Did she try and warn me? Was I too pathetic to see it? I KNEW Lucy was always there for me, I KNEW she was the one thing on this rock that made me feel like I was more than a disaster of a human being, and I KNOW she would never lie to me, not to me, never to me, not Lucy. That was when the beeping stopped, the whispers stopped, no breath on my skin, no wailing in my ears, no tears in my eyes, no blurry vision, nothing, just calm. Like my mind knew who safety was. These things didn’t clear when I talked about Mr. Crown. I didn’t know what time it was, but I also didn’t care. Screw Mr. Crown, screw this life, screw *my* life. I’m going home, I’m not seeing Mr. Crown, and I’m going to see Lucy. Because at least I know she’s real, even if everything else I’ve ever known isn’t. 



Chapter 8: Cracks in his World



**June 1- 2025**

   **Hello, I don’t know what time it is, if the time is even real anymore. I’m at my apartment waiting for Lucy. I will wait for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years if I have to. I will see her today. I have to. I have to know what’s happening to me. As always, thanks for being there for me.”**

**Sincerely**

* **Vincent Road (I think)**



   I sit on my gray, fluffy couch as I absentmindedly fidget with a loose fluffy on the pillow I was holding. I was waiting for Lucy. How I knew she’d come, I don’t know, but I don’t know a lot of things anymore. My whole life has been blurry, unreliable, wrong, unstable, but never like this. I’ve never been normal with the whispers, sirens, etc. I miss when my biggest problem this morning was trying to brush my hair correctly; now it’s wondering if the world I’ve been living in was even real or not.

   No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t shake the image I saw while in that, “vision” of Lucy. She was prying at the bent metal door of a car I don’t remember crashing in. I tried desperately to piece it together, but my vision was still blurry in that moment, but that didn’t change the fact. I knew that was Lucy. I would *always* know if it was Lucy. 

   All of a sudden, I felt a presence beside me, and I looked over, and what I saw shocked me to my core. It was Lucy, but she was not how I’ve ever seen her before. Her normally welcoming gray eyes were red and puffy like she’d been crying for hours, her lip was quivering, but even those weren’t the weirdest part, she was… here. She wasn’t transparent, she wasn’t see through, she was… real. I mean she’s ALWAYS been real, but now she was really here. She had the same red cross, same blue jacket, same latex smell, but then I looked at her, and I felt something that I haven’t felt since the dark pine tree, something familiar. 

“Vincent,” Lucy said shakily, “we need to talk. Y-you might hate me. But I need, I *need you* to listen to me. I under-under- I understand you’re confused, but you *have to listen to me.*”

That terrified me more than I’d ever admit. Lucy didn’t sound like Lucy, she sounded- scared. Lucy NEVER sounded scared, and she called me Vincent, not Vinny. And her voice- god her voice- was so shaky that it hurt to listen to.

   “Lucy, you’re scaring me. What’s going on? What’s that cross on your jacket? Why do you smell like latex? Why- why Lucy,” every second I talked I sounded more desperate, “Why Lucy, why are you really real now? Why were you outside of that car? Was that my car? What the hell is happening Lucy, please?”

   I was crying now, tears flowing uncontrollably out of my dark brown eyes as I stared at Lucy with nothing but desperation. 

   “Vincent- listen to me. That car, that crash, me- it was real, and it did happen.”

   “But how-” she pressed her index finger to my lips

   “Don’t talk, just listen please. Vinny, this world- this reality- *your* reality- isn’t what you think it is-”

“I KNOW that Lucy!” I suddenly hollered, “I’m sorry for yelling and interrupting, but I know this isn’t what I think it is Lucy! But why? If it’s real then why didn’t I remember it? Why-why,” My voice broke as I broke into a sob I didn’t know I had been holding, “WHY Lucy- why-why is this happening to me, who are you REALLY Lucy? Why do you s-s-smell like l-latex? Why do you- are you wearing a red cross? WHY LUCY”

   Lucy did one thing I’ve never seen her do, she *broke.* Tears coming down uncontrollably down her face, dripping onto her jacket. Her hands were trembling from pure emotion, but she continued, she had to tell me. She composed herself enough to talk in full sentences without stuttering, “Vinny, I’ll you, but you have to believe me, promise me,” she held he pinky out, and I reached out and wrapped mine around hers,

“I promise”

“Ok, who am I, Vinny? My name is Lucy Collins. I’m a paramedic at OceanSide Hospital. I know you don’t know what this is, but you will, because it doesn’t exist in this world Vinny. My latex smell? That’s from my gloves. That red cross? It’s my jacket vincent; I’m a paramedic Vinny. I *saved* you that day, in the car. I pried to door open- dammit Vinny I SAVED you,” 

   She broke again, her pinky tightening painfully around mine. I was speechless, not because I didn’t know what she was talking about, but because I did. All of a sudden, I had the faint smell of blood trailing up through my nose, the pounding back in my head, the blurring vision making everything else seem like blurs of colors, and the memories just kept coming.

   Of changing a radio station on my favorite road, of being hit head on by another car and smashing into that tall, dark green pine tree, of Lucy rushing to save me before any firefighter could, of her pulling me out but needing help, of me being dragged to a stretcher that made my ribs feel like hell, of the cold winter air, of the sirens wailing in the distance, but that’s where the memories stopped. I didn’t remember anymore. So I asked her, “Lucy… where am I”

“You’re in a different world, Vinny. You created me Vinny.”

“But why did you wait so long to tell me this? Mr. Crown said-”

 Lucy *stiffened* at his name. 

 “Vincent- do not- and I repeat do not, EVER- go back to his office. He keeps you away from the truth, I need you to trust me.”

 “But the medication-”

 “It’s POISON VINCENT. Mr. Crown may seem nice, but he’s not who you think he is. He keeps you away from the truth. Those meds? That precious medication you’ve had to take for the last 5 years? It’s not real Vinny, it never helped you, YOU helped yourself.”

  I wanted to say something, to say he wasn’t like that, but I couldn’t. For once, there was nothing I could say to defend Mr. Crown. 

  Suddenly, Lucy reached a trembling hands up to my cheek and wiped away a tear I didn’t even feel falling, and smiled warmly at me. Then, without warning, blew away, just like she had by the tree, no warning, no build up, just- gone.

  I should’ve been upset, I should've cried like I haven’t cried in years for her to come back. I should’ve been questioning what she told me. I should’ve been looking for her, for answers, but I wasn’t. I wasn’t confused. I wasn’t looking for her, because she’d told me everything I needed to know, except for one thing, where am I? It didn’t matter right now. I stood up so abruptly my vision blurred for a second. I marched right over the my orange bottle with the white cap sitting on my counter. I picked it up, and I threw those damn medications in the trash.

   This wasn’t like me. I don’t disobey rules. I don’t not listen to Mr. Crown. I don’t not worry, but today’s different. I wasn’t acting like myself, I was aware enough to know that, but I shouldn’t be acting like myself if that version was a whole. Damn. lie.



Chapter 9: A Letter to No One



**June 1- 2025**   

   **Hello, this entry is different from my others- and I’m not doing it because Mr. Crown told me to. I’m doing it because** ***I*** **want to. This day was unlike any I’ve had before. I wished this morning would be better, and I don’t know if that happened today or not. I found out a lot today, and I’m still processing it all, but… I don’t know how to feel.** 

 **I will not be seeing Mr. Crown anymore. He might call, or text, or mail, but I won’t answer it. I don’t know if I’ll ever see Lucy again, but I’ve come to peace with that, because someday, I will. She always felt more “Real” than any of the others, even though she was the least alive in this messed up world. She may not be the Lucy I remember, but she’ll always be Lucy to me.** 

  **I still don’t know where I am. If this is real, if this is my reality, if this isn’t where I’m meant to be, then I’m not complaining. I still can’t tell if that’s good or bad news. On one side, I’ve HATED this world. I got made fun of, the whispers, the sirens, the beeping, my life getting worse after each day, but it was MY world. I always felt like everything worked around me, even if it was working against me.** 

  **I threw my medications away today. It felt wrong, it felt so wrong, but so does everything else I do, so I guess that doesn’t change anything. I keep replaying the crash in my mind, the memories keep coming back one by one, but it still doesn’t make sense. How the hell is anyone supposed to make sense of someone telling them their life was never real? For now, I’ll just keep writing. As always, thank you for being there for me,** 

* **Vincent Road**



Chapter 10: OceanSide Hospital



The fluorescent lights on the ceiling split through the room like they weren’t sure if they were allowed to be there. The cold, square tiles on the floor felt as if they were going to give out at any second from pressure alone. Beside the large hospital bed stood a heart monitor. The doctors talked amongst each other while staring at the figure in the bed with a feeling they couldn’t describe.

   “Heart rate’s steady,”

   “Those damn sirens are so loud today,”

   “Keep your voices down just in case,”

   “What’s his condition now,”

   “Could someone turn off the sink, please,”

  The room was silent except for the murmurs of the doctors. The heart monitor’s rhythmic beep calmed the room in a way only steady equipment could. A few hours ago, they’d almost lost him, but he was ok now. 

  Suddenly, a doctor that had been keeping an eye on the room stepped forward, looking over everything, “Room 317 is quiet tonight…The crash left him unresponsive, but his vitals hold steady for now.”

1ow4y6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1ow4y6t/looking_for_survival_tips/,Looking for Survival Tips!,"Hey there.

I’m a second time mom in the thick of newborn chaos and could really use some advice from parents who’ve been here & dealt with similar situations. 

My 2-month-old has been dealing with what seems like a daily “witching hour” except it’s more like witching HOURS. He has at least one long stretch of being inconsolably awake consecutively for 3+ hours, usually somewhere between 3pm and 9pm. Lots of crying, overtired cues, and nothing really settles him for long. I know this can be normal, but it’s emotionally and physically draining. And yes we’ve tried all the usuals like capping naps at 2hrs during the day, getting sunshine during the day, feeding, rocking, swaddling, pacifier, etc. etc. etc.

To make things more stressful, he was recently diagnosed with some heart issues (biventricular hypertrophy, mild–moderate LVOT obstruction, etc.) and has been prescribed propranolol every 6 hours around the clock, no matter the time. So we’re juggling witching-hour chaos and strict medication timing, nighttime wake-ups to dose him, and keeping him fed/burped/upright while also caring for a toddler. I am burnt out and exhausted. 

If anyone here has:
	• dealt with colic/long witching hours
	• had an infant who needed medication every 6 hours (especially propranolol)
	• tips for managing middle-of-the-night dosing without fully waking the baby or blowing up your whole sleep routine
	• survival strategies for juggling a toddler + a medically complex newborn
	• reassurance that this does get easier
…I would love to hear it.

Right now I’m running mostly on adrenaline, coffee, and whatever sleep I can scrape together. I’m doing my best, but wow, the combination of medical anxiety + colic + sleeplessness is a lot.

Any advice, routines that worked, things you wish you knew, or just solidarity is greatly appreciated. ",1,1763049853.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False
1ow4xvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskZA/comments/1ow4xvc/filterground_instant_coffee/,Filter/ground & instant coffee,"So I made a previous post but noticed people got confused. 

Filter coffee & ground coffee is the same. You need to buy coffee plunger to make these. 

Instant coffee is what you make in a cup with hot water. 


Now that everyone understands.  

The prices of instant coffee is insane. I started buying filter coffee which have nice flavors. But I've also noticed alot more brands on the filter side and less brands on the instant coffee side. With maybe two or 3 brands to choose from its become very bland. 

Are they pushing us to buy more filter coffee? Today I noticed alot more specials on the filter side with lots of new brands and flavors?

1ow4wyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ow4wyu/my_shyness_is_ruining_a_connection_with_a_guy/,My shyness is ruining a connection with a guy,"There’s been a bit of a “slow burn” connection unfolding with a guy I met irl for awhile now. We are both in our 20s, but I’m a couple years older (F). We have really naturally chemistry, and before he found out I was older he was definitely being more overt and flirting with me directly sometimes.

Now, it feels a bit more subdued. We hold eye contact for long stretches, he’s sweet, asks me questions about myself/life, rambles about his life, gives me things, etc. he used to say my name a lot, and be more direct until he found out my age. After the age thing it felt like there was a charge, and I ended the interaction abruptly. Our conversations are always longer than they have to be though (I’m a regular at his work)

The issue is I’m inexperienced with younger/respectful guys, and in my past connections (mostly with older/confident men) guys always just move things forward and don’t linger around like this. I’m also a regular customer at his work, so the only time I see him is there. I’ve thought about just asking him for a coffee, but I get so nervous in the moment. Or something shifts and there’s no opportunity to say anything. 

I’m worried I’m not showing enough interest, or flirting  enough. I just don’t know what to do with out making it potentially awkward. I’m into him, but due to past trauma, it is hard for me to be vulnerable and let my guard down in romantic/sexual situations. And I haven’t crushed on a guy like this in years",1,1763049774.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1ow4uaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ow4uaq/need_help_replacing_our_delonghi_magnifica/,Need help replacing our Delonghi Magnifica,"It’s time to replace our De'Longhi ESAM04110S Magnifica. We’ve liked this machine for the most part - it’s actually our second one. But five years in and it’s limping along like our previous one did before it finally died. 

This being our second Magnifica to meet its demise, I’m not interested in replacing it with another. But I need help deciding on a replacement that fits our needs. 

Fully automatic is a plus because it requires minimal work on our part. But I’m open to semi automatic if there is a justifiable upside. 

Pulling a quality espresso shot or two is top priority. Frothing milk is not a priority because we use a standalone Breville Milk Cafe Frothe. (Our steam wand dial broke off years ago.)

My husband likes a strong Americano. 
I drink lattes. 
Each of us makes maybe two drinks per day, one in the morning and one later. 
My daughter likes the occasional iced latte (she’s only 12, so the ability to use decaf on the fly is a plus.)

Again, we like the fully automatic aspect - just pushing a button and walking away, but I don’t want to sacrifice quality so I’ve been researching semi-automatic as well.  

Honestly, our Magnifica gets messy on the inside with coffee grounds that need vacuumed out periodically otherwise the door won’t close, and the pucks that drop into the interior bin get wet and moldy.  So it’s not exactly “no muss, no fuss”.

I’m interested in hearing others’ thoughts on which machines might be a good replacement for our current setup.

I’ve been tinkering with a note-taking app called [Tivor](https://tivor.me?utm_source=rd&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=launchstartup&utm_id=1), and it’s a bit different from anything I’ve tried before.

Instead of **forcing** you into folders, tags, or checklists, you **just write**. Naturally. Freeform. And Tivor does the thinking for you: it spots **tasks**, **deadlines**, and **routines** in your text automatically.

You can optionally track habits, deadlines, or even mood, but only if it makes sense for you: nothing is forced. **Markdown** works natively, so you can format quickly without menus or clicks.

Here’s a **screenshot of it in action**:

According to witnesses, Lopez, in oversized linen pants, a wide straw hat, and carrying her signature Delola rhinestone tumbler, was visibly rattled — though not by the blaring ferry horn itself. Sources say the singer had recently claimed a “spiritual sign” urged her to avoid flying, prompting a dramatic ferry voyage. As the horn blasted unexpectedly, Lopez jumped, clutching her tumbler so tightly that several rhinestones popped loose and scattered across the deck.

> “She gasped like she’d seen a ghost,” one passenger said. “Then she tried to laugh it off and said, ‘Wow, I’m just like everyone else!’ while picking up rhinestones one by one. It was… not giving grounded.”



Even more telling: sources say Lopez’s panic stemmed from the realization that no one had noticed her “relatable” reaction.

> “She looked around like she was waiting for applause, or at least a phone camera. When nobody moved, she adjusted her hat, fake-laughed again, and whispered something like, ‘stay humble, Jennifer,’” said one onlooker.



Adding to the absurdity, climate activist Greta Thunberg reportedly weighed in on the moment from afar:

> “Ferry runs on diesel. Grounding yourself doesn’t count if the ship is still burning the planet.”



Meanwhile, Bianca Del Rio, who — as fate would have it — was “filming nearby again,” happened to be live-streaming the chaos to her fans. Sipping an iced latte and deadpanning to the camera, Bianca captured the rhinestone fiasco in exquisite slow motion.

Enter Randy Sparkles, tuning in live from Provincetown. Within minutes, he had joined the feed with a flurry of observations:

💬 “Is she trying to barter with the crew for validation?”
💬 “Tell her humility isn’t a brand, it’s a concept.”
💬 “Can’t she at least have her team pay some people to act scared along with her?”
💬 “I’m physically exhausted from watching someone pretend to be relatable. Someone hold her hand.”
💬 “Next time, just pay a few locals to gasp. That’s all it takes.”



Once safely on land, Lopez continued her mission of authenticity, making a beeline for Espresso Love in Edgartown. Patrons were stunned as she attempted the ultimate “down-to-earth” coffee run, ordering an oat milk latte while posing as though she’d just bumped into an old friend. Bianca, never missing a beat, followed with her signature ham and cheese sandwich gag.

> “One’s for Ms. Humble over there — extra authentic,” Bianca called to the barista, who looked like she’d seen it all before.



The scene was rounded out by the subtle chaos of spilled rhinestones, an espresso machine whirring ominously, and a few bemused local celebrities quietly shaking their heads from nearby tables.

Celebrity reactions (as captured on X/Twitter):

Tina Fey: “Watching her collect rhinestones like they’re emotional support animals is… too much. I can’t.”

Anna Wintour: “Huffed and left the ferry. Again. Some people really don’t get subtlety.”

Rihanna: “Not sure if I should cry for the rhinestones or laugh at the spectacle. Send help.”

Ashanti: “This is why coffee runs need stunt doubles. #JustSaying”

Bette Midler: “Bless her heart. It’s a full-on Broadway number every time she leaves the house. That’s no way to win a Tony.”

Lindsay Lohan: “Can’t she just take the ferry quietly like the rest of us?!”

Gwyneth Paltrow: “Her aura is very… sparkling today.” (She immediately burned sage after posting.)

Natasha Ramos: “Watching her collect rhinestones is like performance art if you hate performance art.”

Greta Thunberg: “Ferry runs on diesel. Grounding yourself doesn’t count if the ship is still burning the planet.”


Fan Reactions from Bianca’s Live-Stream:

@SequinQueen99: “I can’t. She literally dropped rhinestones like a Christmas tree exploded. Ms. Humble indeed 😂✨”

@FerryWatcher42: “Watching J.Lo fake-laugh while no one notices her panic is the most relatable unrelatable thing ever.”

@DragForever: “Bianca just casually filmed her collecting rhinestones. Iconic. This is art.”

@RhinestoneRiot: “Randy Sparkles is delivering commentary like the Greek chorus we didn’t know we needed.”

@LatteLurker: “Ham and cheese for Ms. Humble? I am dying. Please, someone clip this for history.”

@EcoEyeRoll: “Also, she’s taking the diesel ferry to ‘ground herself.’ Iconic. Greta approves. Not.”

@VineyardVibes: “This is why we can’t have nice, quiet mornings in Edgartown. Rhinestones everywhere. Send help.”

@DramaDailyFan: “Bianca streaming, Randy live-commenting, J.Lo trying to be relatable… this is literally peak 2025.”


By the time Lopez left — carefully balancing her tumbler, hat, and leftover rhinestones — the Vineyard was left to reflect on a simple truth: nothing screams “relatable” quite like an ostentatious ferry meltdown, live-streamed by a drag queen, with your personal cheerleader watching from Provincetown, and every tweet and fan comment documenting the spectacle in real time.Jennifer Lopez’s ongoing quest for “relatability” hit the shores of Martha’s Vineyard Friday morning, and if passengers aboard the ferry to Edgartown thought they were in for a quiet ride, they were gravely mistaken.

According to witnesses, Lopez, in oversized linen pants, a wide straw hat, and carrying her signature Delola rhinestone tumbler, was visibly rattled — though not by the blaring ferry horn itself. Sources say the singer had recently claimed a “spiritual sign” urged her to avoid flying, prompting a dramatic ferry voyage. As the horn blasted unexpectedly, Lopez jumped, clutching her tumbler so tightly that several rhinestones popped loose and scattered across the deck.

> “She gasped like she’d seen a ghost,” one passenger said. “Then she tried to laugh it off and said, ‘Wow, I’m just like everyone else!’ while picking up rhinestones one by one. It was… not giving grounded.”



Even more telling: sources say Lopez’s panic stemmed from the realization that no one had noticed her “relatable” reaction.

> “She looked around like she was waiting for applause, or at least a phone camera. When nobody moved, she adjusted her hat, fake-laughed again, and whispered something like, ‘stay humble, Jennifer,’” said one onlooker.

This infatuation can last a few minutes to almost a month. I’ve tried commitment but it became hell after the honeymoon stage (2 years after the relationship began). I want to understand why this is the case and if others have advice for me.

For some context, I was in a long distance relationship. This girl is from my home city and I went far away for University. The relationship was fine the first 2 years, as whenever I felt off in the relationship, I’d talk to my roommate who seemed to always say the right things, making me levelheaded. After those first 2 years, I began living on my own without roommates and during the summers had internships elsewhere. During the internships, I was in a new city all alone, and being in the relationship began to feel like a chore. I restricted myself from going to certain places whether it be group settings or 1:1 chats with other women just out of respect for her. 

Absolutely not tooting my own horn, but I’m a very attractive, charismatic, social, and emotionally understanding guy. I get along with almost everyone, handle conflicts peacefully, and can make others feel comfortable around me. With that said, I tend to receive a lot of attention from women both irl and online (I occasionally post videos). And I unfortunately have a wondering eye that I can’t seem to get rid of. I find every body beautiful. I’ve traveled to 10 countries just this year alone and seen so many attractive people, it makes me feel weird. I’d love to be with just one person as this would make my life easier in every way, but I have these what ifs and urges to just have a conversation with these people. I’m curious about their background. What they do to end up sitting next to me at this coffee shop on a random Tuesday at 3pm. And the fact that I believe I have the capabilities to have these conversations and date these women makes my thoughts feel real. And at the end, if I were to date them, I would always seek someone else because I enjoy the novelty. My previous girl was drop dead gorgeous, we never had problems, she could carry conversations, funny, social, and trustworthy. Yet, I struggled.
The only con of the relationship was I couldn’t find my ambitious nature within her and we rarely had intellectually engaging conversations. That said, when I was in town and we hung out, I never had an issue and the wandering eye seemed to disappear, but I’m rarely ever in town.

I try to reason with myself on why I struggled in the relationship. I’m not a very organized person in general. I’m very hectic and procrastinate almost everything. I enjoy that rush. I enjoy cities like NYC that make me want to rush. I don’t know if I have the desire to be with someone forever when I crave novelty and excitement, especially when I encounter stunning women on a daily basis

Am I wrong? Is there a way for me to be committed? I always believed a relationship/marriage is based on loyalty not love. I thought this was a “wise” belief, but as I grow older, I feel it might be simply naive. ",1,1763049395.0,TooAfraidToAsk,1,1.0,False

Macros are 1395kcal 124g protein 91g fat 20g or less carbs. It's all from animal protein, eggs, and whey.

(Yes I have read the faqs!)

So I have noticed that it has been a hit or miss at the gym. Someday I managed to make PB and feel amazing, someday I am just really lethargic.

However, I still could not consistently hit the gym as hard as I'd like everytime I go. I try to hit failure every set, but someday I think I hit a fake, mental failure instead of the physical one. I want to be consistent, and I'd like to ask if anyone has tips on how to prepare for the session better. 

E.g. How long do you guys warm up? How do you hype yourself for the lift? Signs to look for for over training? (I go 6 day a week, push pull leg core. Idk if an hour per session is too much?)

One idea I have is, I noticed is that if I respect the 'drink the mct+coffee+whey pre-workout 30 minutes before the session' instead of hitting the weights right away, it helps a lot. So I am going to drink it and then do some light active stretches and warm up for 20-30 min before going for the big moves. Would that work?

I want my hands to shake when I am eating my dinner like that one clip with Arnold, but I just could not push hard enough.

1ow4k9p,https://i.redd.it/boa8l7glp11g1.png,Book Today and Experience Mumbai Privately Tomorrow,"Mumbai, the “City of Dreams,” is more than just a bustling metropolis; it's an incredible blend of history, culture, food, architecture, and unforgettable stories. While millions of people walk through its crowded streets every day, the best way to truly experience the city is not in a hurry or with a crowd, but in your own time and at your own pace. That’s why a private journey through Mumbai isn’t just travel, it's discovery, comfort, and a deeper connection to the city.

This blog takes you through why booking a private experience today can transform the way you explore Mumbai tomorrow. From hidden gems tucked away in old neighborhoods to iconic landmarks that define the skyline, you’ll learn how a carefully curated private tour can make all the difference.

**Why Choose a Private Experience in Mumbai?**

Mumbai is alive 24/7, with every corner offering something new a burst of color, a unique smell, a song from the street, or an aroma from a local kitchen. However, this energy can feel overwhelming if you don’t know where to start. Large group tours often move too quickly, skipping the authentic charm that gives Mumbai its soul.

A private experience allows you to:

* **Set your own pace** – No rushing, no waiting. Whether you want to linger at the Gateway of India or wander longer through the bazaars of Crawford Market, the time is yours.  
* **Personalize your journey** – Love history? Spend more time at colonial landmarks. A foodie? Dive deep into street food spots at Chowpatty or Mohammad Ali Road.  
* **Connect deeply** – With a private guide, you can ask questions, hear stories, and explore cultural insights that aren’t always shared in larger groups.  

**Tomorrow’s Memories Start with Today’s Booking**

It’s easy to delay travel decisions, telling yourself you’ll book “someday.” But the reality is that travel memories are waiting to be created, and the sooner you plan, the richer your experience will be. When you book your [**Mumbai Private Tour** ](https://magicalmumbaitours.com/tour-activity/mumbai-city-sightseeing/)experience today, you ensure a smooth, well-organized tomorrow.

With everything arranged in advance—from transport to curated itineraries—you step into Mumbai ready to explore without stress. Instead of worrying about logistics, you’ll simply wake up tomorrow with anticipation, knowing your day belongs to discovery.

**The Iconic and the Intimate: What Awaits You**

# 1. The Iconic Mumbai

No journey is complete without seeing the landmarks that make Mumbai instantly recognizable. The Gateway of India, standing proudly by the Arabian Sea, greets you with colonial grandeur. Just across the water, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel embodies timeless elegance.

From there, the heritage architecture of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, captures both Gothic and Indian styles in a masterpiece that comes alive with history.

And of course, Marine Drive, famously called the “Queen’s Necklace,” sparkles by evening, offering you a serene moment to soak in the city’s rhythm.

# 2. The Intimate Mumbai

Beyond the icons, Mumbai hides treasures known mostly to locals. Imagine walking through narrow lanes of Girgaum, where tiny workshops and old houses whisper stories of generations. Picture yourself in the vibrant chaos of Dadar flower market, surrounded by colors and fragrances that turn an ordinary morning into a memory.

Or step into Banganga Tank, an ancient water reservoir tucked in Malabar Hill, where myths, spirituality, and calmness coexist amidst the city’s rush. These intimate corners reveal the heart of Mumbai quiet, authentic, and unforgettable.

**Food: Mumbai’s True Language**

You can’t say you’ve experienced Mumbai without tasting it. From the crunch of vada pav, the city’s most beloved street snack, to the richness of seafood curries in coastal eateries, food is a bridge between the city and its people.

A private experience lets you savor food the way you want hygienically, at handpicked spots, and guided by someone who knows exactly where the flavors are most authentic. Whether it’s savoring bhel puri at Chowpatty Beach or sipping Irani chai in a century-old café, every bite becomes a memory you’ll carry back home.

**Stories that Bring Mumbai Alive**

Every landmark, lane, and meal in Mumbai carries a story. Did you know the Gateway of India was originally built to welcome King George V and Queen Mary in 1911? Or that Marine Drive got its nickname “Queen’s Necklace” because of how the streetlights sparkle like pearls at night?

Your private guide weaves these stories into your journey, transforming stone, streets, and statues into living characters. Mumbai isn’t just a city you see—it’s a city you listen to, through its tales, myths, and voices.

**Beyond the City Center**

Many visitors think Mumbai begins and ends in South Mumbai. But the city stretches wide, with surprises in every corner. Head north to Sanjay Gandhi National Park, where leopards roam and ancient Buddhist caves sit hidden in the forest. Visit Bandra, a trendy suburb filled with street art, colonial-era churches, and Bollywood’s biggest celebrity homes. Or stroll along Versova Beach, where the sunset feels like a private performance just for you.

When you book a private experience, you can choose to go beyond the usual and craft an itinerary that truly fits your curiosity.

**Comfort and Confidence in Every Step**

For many travelers, especially first-time visitors, Mumbai can feel intimidating. The language, traffic, and sheer size of the city may seem challenging. A private tour experience removes this anxiety. With door-to-door transport, curated stops, and a local expert, you’ll feel safe, confident, and ready to immerse yourself in everything Mumbai offers.

Your tomorrow doesn’t have to be stressful—it can be inspiring, energizing, and comfortable, simply because you chose to plan today.

**The Gift of Time**

Time is the most valuable gift while traveling. Unlike group tours where schedules are rigid, a private journey through Mumbai ensures you maximize every moment. Want to spend extra time photographing Gothic arches? Prefer to take a spontaneous coffee break in a local café? With no pressure from a group, the city bends to your rhythm.

Tomorrow, you won’t just remember where you went you’ll remember how you felt. That freedom is priceless.

**A Journey Worth Booking Today**

Mumbai is not a city you check off a list; it’s a city you feel. It’s in the sea breeze along Marine Drive, in the clang of temple bells, in the cheerful bargaining of market vendors, and in the warmth of strangers who feel like friends.

When you choose a Mumbai Private Tour, you’re not just signing up for sightseeing—you’re crafting a personal journey through one of the world’s most dynamic cities. And when you decide to join a[ **Mumbai tour**](https://magicalmumbaitours.com/) tomorrow, you’ll step into an experience that feels both intimate and expansive, a perfect balance of comfort and adventure.

So, why wait? Book today, and let tomorrow be the beginning of your unforgettable Mumbai story.

I missed a couple evening doses. Then I smashed my stupid head on the damn cupboard my husband never effing closes, I had too much coffee because the sleep bank is empty. Skip a meal or two because the nausea from the migraine is too much.... 

I can't stop the things I have to do because I feel off or too tired. I have to do the things... the world shouldn't stop for me, i feel like ive overused my ""village"", I dont want to ask for help anymore...

 And then blam. I wake up at 5am to my husband watching me intently, worried, telling me to chill for a bit. I'd rather he not tell me it happened. I'd rather ignore the signs my body and brain are showing me, I'd rather not let my daughter see me defeated and in tears... i'd rather ignore the looks of pity from family and friends...

Joplin Sibtain replaced Rory McCann as the beloved Ferrix bestie after McCann slipped on ice and did his knee in. They had already started shooting and Joplin’s face was digitally super imposed for a few shots. 

Anton Lesser suggests that Partagaz was moved when listening to Nemik. He originally had a monologue and learned it by heart. But it was cut. All Tony Gilroy said when confronted about this was: “Yep”. 

Alastair McKenzie (Perrin) recalls being told he had the job over a London Soho breakfast with Gilroy… before the latter had to abandon his coffee and croissant and rush to Heathrow airport before the US borders closed. It was March 2020: the Coronavirus pandemic was underway. It was a year before production could probably start up again.

If the International Bagel Center is a bonus today I would grab that before getting the coffee. After that I would run back for a fresh cart and go straight for the housewares section where I'd grab garbage cans and hoses. Next to housewares is the expensive film which I'd grab and then head over to the health and beauty aides section where I'd grab all the expensive medicines and beauty products. Then I would run over and grab giant wedges of cheese and ham from the deli section. At this point my cart would probably be full so I'd rush back, hopefully with a bonus in hand or cart. After getting a new cart I'd go straight for the diapers and the giant cans of oil, then I'd grab the candy for and additional $100 or go for whatever special bonus is in play that day.

I (21 M) work as a junior photographer for a small media studio, and I’ve been quietly crushing on a coworker (let’s call her “J”) for a while. Yesterday evening I was practicing editing some behind-the-scenes footage from a shoot and decided to send J a text: something casual like “hey J, saw you on the footage—looked great! Want to grab coffee tomorrow after work?” I typed it on my phone while watching the footage, then got called by our senior to check something in the main office. I unlocked my phone, replied to the senior’s message, and planned to send the text to J as soon as I’m done.

Fast forward: I finish the office task and go to send the text to J. I open my messaging app, pick what I think is J’s contact (it shows “J – edit team”), type the message quickly, hit send, and head out for the night. Later I’m scrolling through my phone and accidentally open the group chat for our entire photography/editing team (about 15 people). I freeze. There is my message about J, saying “hey J, saw you on the footage—looked great! Want to grab coffee tomorrow after work?” except it wasn’t in J’s one-on-one chat, it’s in the group chat with the whole team. My heart sinks.

The next morning I walk into the studio and immediately get weird looks. The team chat is going nuts with “did you mean to send that?”, “coffee invite for all of us?” and J is awkwardly smiling while avoiding eye contact. I tried to laugh it off and said “oops wrong chat” but it didn’t help. My senior teased me during the meeting about “team coffee tomorrow, same time?” and I just died inside. J later whispered to me “that was bold…” and laughed. I’m not sure if she meant in a good way or a bad way. Either way, I feel like I made myself look like a total amateur.

So now I’m spending the day avoiding the group chat, trying not to be the center of attention, hoping this blows over. I know I messed up because it was me who sent it to the wrong group, and it’s awkward for everyone (especially J). Lesson: always double-check who you’re texting before hitting send.

TL;DR: I meant to send a personal compliment/invite to a coworker, but accidentally sent it to our entire work team chat instead, making things super awkward.",0,1763048313.0,tifu,6,0.14,False

I was so grateful​, he really didn’t need to do that, but he said since I was a super nice regular he was happy to bring them out early.

Recently I noticed that I’m actually more productive and consistent when things are less structured. When I don’t have to jump across five tools just to update everything. Turns out, I only need one things: a place to throw notes quickly, without thinking about folders or categories, but still easy to search later.

So far I’ve found that electrolytes and seltzer water are helping, coffee is making it much worse. But every time I eat, it’s like “am I going to be fine or feel like throwing up for the next two hours?” Not sure if it’s important but I’m also on 100mg bupropion (SR).

I've drank coffee for many years, but over the last 20 years, I mostly ""went along"" with getting a coffee that my MIL likes to drink.  She drinks about 4X what I drink.  So I was just ""going along"" with it to keep peace in the house.  (She lived with us.)

I could tell the difference between hazelnut and other flavors.  My MIL would swap between hazelnut and any dark roast.  

(Why didn't I just get my own coffee?   It wasn't a priority and at the time, I didn't care.)

Now that she's no longer in the house, I have tried other coffee flavors...

BUT,

Aside from the smell of the bag of coffee, I don't taste anything different.

I used to get coffee from Sams' in the big box, but I learned that because it would take me awhile to get through a box, the coffee may have lost it's flavor over time.  But I then went to small bags like you see in conventional grocery stores.

Now after trying a few, it seems to me that all coffee tastes the same (except maybe the hazelnut).

Is that possibly because grocery store coffee is just as bad as the Sams' big boxes of coffee, or should I be getting coffee from a more specialized source.

Or is it that I'm in my 60's and my senses are failing?

1ow4055,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1ow4055/is_6_hours_or_sometimes_less_okay_for_a_16_year/,Is 6 hours (or sometimes less) okay for a 16 year old?,"So, I am going to say the truth, 8 hours of sleep is possible, but from very childhood onwards (like 4 or 5), I have always been a night person and always have slept late. But up until last year, I have been able to get about 8 hours, since there wasn't much academic pressure and generally less things to worry about. Also, I was less of a caffeine addict back then, and this might also be a reason

But now, the academic pressure has increased by 10x, and also generally, I'm stressed out by everthing. I don't even find happiness or pleasure in the things and hobbies I did before, like playing video games. Just a dude trying to fit into society. Also, now I'm kinda a caffeine addict (that's literally what my friends call me). I will take coffee/tea over cola/sodas all day, any day, and I have done it in the past. And, recently, my energy drink consumption has entered some dangerous level. Even though it's only thursday, I have already drank 3 cans of energy drinks this week. I don't even get that boost anymore, it's just that bad.

Anyways, that was just a small context about my currntife situation. The reason I'm making this post is because of my current phase of life/school, which is exams. From October till February, all we are gonna have is exams, nothing else. Classes stopped in October, and we only meet to write exams. So that's why, I can get 6 hours at best

You see, even though we have exams constantly, it's not everyday. Our current pattern is 1 day exam, 3-4 days study holiday, which means practically I can get 8 hours if I tried. But the problem is, if I want to get 8 hours, I need to get into bed by 10, and actually, I have my dinner by 9:30, and as I said before, I'm a night person. Due to this exam stress, I don't have much time to do my other leisure activities during the day, so I am doing them at night. For example, I'm watching a series, and I really want to finish it within a short period, because I have never finished something like this because I don't have much free time. Like literally, I bought a book an year ago now, and I'm still reading it. 

Basically what I am trying to say is, if I want everything in my life to go on smoothly, and just reduce the stress, I need to sacrifice my sleep and settle for 6 or even less. But, if I sacrifice all my leisure activities, and become a robot, i.e. wake up-study-eat-sleep, with no real human/soul inside me, then I can get 8 hours. So the question really is, which poision should I choose?

(Btw the series I'm watching right now is called Sex Education on Netflix, it's a great show and would definitely recommend! Feels like it dosent get enough recognition. Also, the book I'm reading is called Surrounded By Idiots, amazing book if you want to dive into the human mind and learn why people act they way they act, and what you can do to become more efficient with almost everyone in every way. But as I mentioned, even after a year of reading, I haven't finished it yet!)",1,1763047651.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

If you're like me, you’ve probably tried a few things, more sleep, more coffee, different supplements, only to find that it’s not enough. At 1st Optimal, where we specialize in optimizing health for high-achieving adults, we see this every day.

One of the biggest challenges I’ve noticed in my own journey and with clients is maintaining consistent energy and focus without burning out. It’s common to feel sluggish or even moody, but there’s a more systemic reason for this. Hormones like cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, and thyroid hormones play a massive role in regulating our energy and mood. If they’re out of balance, it’s almost impossible to feel your best.

The issue is that most solutions are one-size-fits-all. That’s why we’ve leaned into personalized lab testing to identify exactly what’s happening in the body. Whether it’s cortisol spikes from stress, thyroid issues, or deficiencies in key nutrients, understanding the root causes leads to lasting improvements.

What I’ve learned is that it’s not about fixing symptoms with a quick solution, it’s about understanding the underlying systems and addressing them with precision. This could mean adjusting your hormone levels, refining your diet, or even tweaking your sleep habits based on what the labs tell you.

It’s not about striving for “perfection” either, it’s about sustainable results. I’ve worked with so many clients who finally have that breakthrough when they start to treat their health with the same focus and strategy they use in their careers.

So here’s the question: *What’s worked best for you in managing energy or hormones as you’ve hit your 40s?* Have you had success with a personalized approach, or are you still navigating the trial-and-error phase?

1ow3xub,https://v.redd.it/q2nel10bl11g1,Review of Ambiente in Sedona,"My last review escaped into the ether, so let me try this again!
 
My boyfriend and I recently took a trip to Sedona, and I saw the most recommendations for Ambiente and Enchantment in this subreddit, so I took your advice and booked some time at each (and we stayed at the Phoenician in Phoenix, which I’ll review after Enchantment). You guys don’t miss!
 
I’ll preface my review and say the nightly rate at Ambiente was about double what Enchantment cost, but I know the rates can fluctuate wildly, and it looks to me like the prices can often be closer in range, so YMMW. I had to be in Phoenix for a conference, so I didn’t have much wiggle room on dates.
 
*Service*: 
Man, this was awesome! Valet took our car and bags, we were greeted by name by everyone in the lobby, champagne toast at check-in (and in the room, thanks @alex_travels!). We ended up doing the convertible driving experience, and even though we missed when we were supposed to check it out (I hadn’t realized there are specified windows for this), they said no problem and sent us on our way. There’s a text concierge option, and they responded within 90 seconds every time I texted them. There was also a level of enthusiasm and joy that I’ve only seen at a few hotels—the employee who took us on the golf cart to our room couldn’t help but tell us all of the cool things about the property and how much he loved it (reminded me of the first time we went to the Fifth Avenue Hotel in NY); it just felt really genuine.
 
When we got up early and went to the pool and hot tub one morning, an attendant brought out ice water within 3-4 minutes, and when I asked about late check out, I was told no problem, just enjoy yourself without actually specifying a time. The key card did stop working at check out time (unfortunately when we were coming back wet from the pool), but I texted the concierge and an employee zipped so fast it actually startled me (seriously, it was like 45 seconds, and poof, a helpful bellman with the speed of Dracula was swiping us in).
 
I will also caveat this that Ambiente is smaller than Enchantment and we did not see many people other than ourselves (which I didn’t mind at all—it felt private) which is probably why we were able to get so much individual attention, but I’ll take it. Overall, one of the best service experience stays—I was very impressed!
 
*Room/Property*: 
The hard product is *chef’s kiss*. It is certainly a vibe, and I loved it. I get a bit disappointed when there’s a famous, well-reviewed hotel and it’s sterile, but this place has personality for miles. They have individual pods/casitas and a few different levels of rooms which have increasingly better views. We booked the lowest room level which probably would have been a view of the walking path (the next level up is the creek view or the forest view—essentially not pointing at the back of another pod/casita). We ended up getting an upgrade and staying in Room 32, which I believe is technically a Forest View room (thanks again @alex_travels), but because of its positioning, has a straight-on view of the creek, the trees, the pool, and the red rocks! I was so stoked about the view, and it was really fun doing the automatic blinds for sunrise in the morning to such a beautiful view.
 
The actual room itself is like if Restoration Hardware went to NYU for a year, and came back with a massive budget to back up the vision. It was moody, but offset by hints of plushness (and the beautiful copper fixtures everywhere; and the giant charcoal tub in every room!). Even the robes and slippers were black in order to not clash with the aesthetic. I actually took pictures of the bathroom for inspiration since we’re doing a redesign in one of our bathrooms at home.
 
All the technology also fit in with the slick vibe. The TV on the ceiling motorized to lower when needed, but to return to place when just enjoying the views was inspired. All the motorized stuff/lights/etc is all hardwired into buttons in the wall by the bed (no remotes/etc). The coffee was pre-ground and measured out for 2 people (so cute!), and the non-liquor minibar/snack items were complimentary (we very much wish we’d taken some of these to go since we paid $55 for drinks and snacks at the Enchantment market later).
 
The pool is heated and hot tub was lovely (no red rock views here, though—I’m guessing they maxed out the views for the rooms). Ambiente was right off a main road/highway in Sedona, and I was worried about the noise, but we didn’t hear a thing and I forgot about it entirely (maybe this depends on the location of your casita, though). I’ll talk about this more in the next review, but Enchantment actually had more ambient noise from the next room over compared to Ambiente, which was silent for us.  
 
Each casita also has a spiral staircase up to the roof with a little green area, a firepit, a bed/couch, and everyone has views of the red rocks from here. We stargazed one night (they actually have a guy from NASA who will do a private experience if you want but I found out it’s the same guy who does the free group stargazing at Enchantment, so we ended up doing that one). I could have kicked myself for not bringing a drone for this place.
 
*Food*: 
They have one restaurant (Forty1) that was delicious, but if I was staying longer, I think I would have gotten a little bored with the same menu. I also like to mix it up and do some casual and some fancy restaurants on vacation (this is a place where you will hear “mouth feel”, “notes of chartreuse”, “spirit-forward” and “effervescent”—my boyfriend asked if one of the drinks with cinnamon had the flavor profile of pumpkin spice and I was very happy we were not removed from the establishment). In the summer, they have a poolside bar with food called Drift, but it wasn’t open when we were there. Thankfully, it’s really close to many other great restaurant options (one positive for being right off the main road), and I highly recommend Mariposa if you end up staying here.

*Activities*: 
They can curate something for you if you want, and I highly highly recommend the convertible drive (so much more fun than I expected), but I wanted to do specific things like Pink Jeep tour and hot air balloon ride, so I just booked those separately. 
 
*Spa*: 
I booked couples’ massages at both Ambiente and Enchantment and I was going to compare, but unfortunately one of our Ambiente masseuses had a family emergency and I didn’t want to switch one of us to a facial in a different room. I only decided to include this in the review because it highlights that Ambiente does have a more private, boutique feel, but then you have less staff across the board for things like this.
 
*Overall impression*: 
Had an absolute blast here, would definitely recommend in a heartbeat. I was sure that Enchantment wouldn’t be able to touch Ambiente after this experience, but it definitely has its place. I’m glad we went to Ambiente first, because the views took my breath away, but then Enchantment took my breath away again. You don’t realize the scale of scenery that Enchantment has from a picture (at least I didn’t). Ambiente won handily for me on design and aesthetic and Enchantment won on views. Overall, I’m really glad we went to both, and in a perfect world I’d just transplant Ambiente into Boynton Canyon. As it is, the vibe, the experience, and the enthusiastic joy of the staff made it a 5 star experience for us.",9,1763047495.0,chubbytravel,18,0.85,False

Obviously, my long-term future ahead is stable and high-paying, but currently in debt and rely heavily on parental support, which I feel somewhat guilty about. That being said, I am currently in a relationship around 3-4 months long, where I have been happily paying for every date, coffee, flowers, even sometimes ubereating her food (when she feels down). We had a recent argument where I met her sister, and she said she was dissatisfied that I did not pay for her sister's food, since it did not come off as impressive. We had a long discussion about the fact that I am not in a position where I am financially comfortable doing that, and that it is not easy for me to be fronting things especially since she makes 85k, and I make -200k. With interviews, I will probably be eating another 5-10k in expenses, which I explained to her.

Afterwards, when we went out to eat, and I ""forgot"" my wallet, hoping that she would maybe proactively foot the bill, but she made me go pay for it with my phone lol. Today, she called me so I could pay for her coffee, which I reluctantly did, to which she said ""You don't have to if you don't want to."" I sent her my card, and she just bought it anyways without a further thank-you or anything. She pays for some small things, but I generally foot pretty much everything. I just feel an immense discrepancy that makes me somewhat annoyed.

Overall, I'm trying to contemplate if this warrants another discussion, but I am not sure if this is gonna work out to be honest. I feel she is looking for a complete provider, and I am happy to be that someone in the future, but I am not in the best financial state, and I feel that we are very much financially incompatible. Wanted to know other people's thoughts on this, as I am going to meet her parents soon, but I would rather not open that door if the long-term future is bleak looking.",1,1763047017.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

1ow3ozv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1ow3ozv/5_week_post_op_appointment/,5 week post op appointment,"Posting my update for anyone who might be interested in what to expect around 5 weeks post op.   

Just had my 5 week post op appointment with my surgeon, ACL only, hamstring graft. For reference, my doctor never had me in a brace and i was able to weight bear immediately, crutches for 3 weeks. 

Doing well, my extension and flexion are good, he says I'm a little  ""ahead"" of schedule. I have 0 degrees just fine, after doing exercises i get a few degrees past that, so it's coming along. My pain is low, only taking otc meds as needed, like after a tough PT session. 

We discussed swelling,  it's still normal and I should continue to ice, elevate when I can. That is the most limiting factor in regaining flexion, so be patient. Im at 150 degrees now, so im not really concerned. I'm on my feet all day (teacher) and I wear light compression socks (15-20 mg, thigh high) to help with swelling. By the end of the day my knee, ankle and foot get puffy. Continue with PT and staying active, walking, stationary bike, etc. Eat well, sleep, take care of yourself, etc.

We talked about during the first 6 weeks, the risk of reinjury comes from any sudden, uncontrolled fall that could cause the graft to tear out of the bone tunnels. Now as I reach the 6 week mark and beyond, scar tissue in the bone and graft will have fused to make the connection strong, but the risk now becomes the center of the graft tissue will be at its weakest point. This is when the body is working to establish new blood supply  to the tissue. He cautioned me to be careful when walking, especially on wet leaves or ice, as a bad fall at this point can cause a retear. 

I go back in 5 weeks and they will fit me for a functional brace to wear during training.  When the PT says I'm ready to start more dynamic exercises I should wear it, but not for day to day things. 

So good news all around. I appreciate that my doctor takes time to explain things in detail in a way I can understand and he listens to my questions. My blood pressure was high today, but I also just downed my coffee in the car so maybe that's why? I have never had high BP before.

Good luck everyone!

# #2. Duck legs baked with prunes and apples

How about a fragrant duck with a golden crust? First, we soak the duck legs in milk - so the meat will become tender and softer.

Pour in the water. Add the bay leaf. Bake duck legs with apples and prunes in a preheated 356F oven until cooked and browned, 60 minutes.

After the time has elapsed, we take the dish out of the oven. We transfer the duck legs and prunes to a plate.

We prepare the necessary products. Peel the onion and cut it into thin half rings. In a frying pan, heat the vegetable oil and fry the onion on medium heat for 3-4 minutes.

Peel the carrots and cut them in half. Each half of the carrot is cut into plates, which in turn are cut into medium strips. Carrots are sent to the onion and fried on medium heat for 5-6 minutes.  
We wipe the quince with the hard side of the kitchen sponge, peeling off the plaque, and cut and remove the seeds. Cut the quince into small cubes. Put the quince in a frying pan and fry for 4-5 minutes. Peel the pumpkin and cut it into the same cubes as the quince.

Add the pumpkin to the rest of the ingredients, and mix everything together. Add curry, paprika, Italian herbs, salt, and a mixture of peppers. Garlic is cleaned and passed through a press into a frying pan.  
Mix it up. Fry for 4-5 minutes. Then cover with a lid and cook on low heat for another 5 minutes.

We serve pumpkin with quince and carrots hot as an independent dish or as a side dish to meat. Enjoy your meal!

# #4. Potato patties with walnuts and flax seeds

Very [nutritious](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/cooking/5-healthy-delicious-and-vitamin-salads-master-class-32/) potato patties with crispy walnuts and [healthy](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/vitamin-and-balanced-recipes-for-dishes-with-active-mental-activity-healthy-dinner-14-1617850e7174?source=user_profile---------19----------------------------) flax seeds are a great kitchen idea. Despite the lack of meat, the cutlets are quite satisfying.

**Ingredients for 6 servings:**  
Potatoes 14.10oz  
Rye bread 3.53oz  
Walnuts 10.58oz  
Onion 5.29oz  
Garlic 2 cloves  
Wheat flour 3 tablespoons  
Vegetable oil 2 tablespoons  
Smoked paprika to taste  
Flax (seeds) 2 tablespoons  
Ground black pepper to taste  
Salt to taste

**Instruction:**

Cooking time one hour 30 minutes

Prepare the necessary ingredients. Instead of rye bread, you can take white. Spices can be chosen according to your taste.  
Adjust the amount of garlic at your discretion. Peel the potatoes and cut them into pieces. Put the potatoes in a saucepan and pour cold water level. Add a little salt.  
Put the pan on the fire and bring the water to a boil. Cook the potatoes for 20 minutes, until tender. The cooking time depends on the variety and size of the potato pieces.

Cut the rye bread into slices. If the crust is very dense, cut it off. Use the bread together with the crust.  
Fill the bread with cold water (1 cup) and leave for 10 minutes at room temperature. Peel the onion and cut it into cubes.  
Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and put the onion there.

Fry the onion over low heat, stirring, for 8 minutes, until transparent. Let the fried onion cool slightly. Grind flax seeds in a coffee grinder, blender, or mortar.

Pour the crushed flax seeds into a deep dish. Pour in 2 tablespoons of water at room temperature and mix well.

Check the readiness of the potatoes - they should be easily pierced with a sharp object. Drain the broth from the finished potatoes.

Mash the potatoes to the consistency of mashed potatoes and cool to a warm state. Pour the walnuts into the bowl of a blender. Chop the nuts to fine crumbs. It can be passed through a meat grinder.

Put the cooled mashed potatoes in a deep bowl. Add the chopped walnuts.

Mix, it is most convenient to do it with your hands. Squeeze the swollen bread well from the liquid and grind it with a meat grinder or blender (you can grate it on a grater).  
Add the bread to the potato-nut mass and mix. Put the fried onions there and mix. Add the swollen crushed flax seeds. Mix it up. Pour in the wheat flour and mix.  
Peel the garlic, pass it through a press, and add it to a bowl with potato mass. Add smoked paprika, salt, and ground black pepper. Mix well.

You should get a dense mass that lends itself well to molding. With slightly damp hands, form cutlets of the desired size and shape from the ""minced meat"". Heat the remaining vegetable oil in a frying pan and put the blanks there.

Fry the cutlets on low-medium heat for 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Place the cutlets on a paper towel to remove the remaining oil. Potato patties with walnuts are ready. Serve the cutlets with sweet and sour sauce and a salad of fresh or pickled vegetables. Enjoy your meal!

Salt to taste  
Ground black pepper to taste  
Olive oil  3 tablespoons

**Instruction:**  
[Cooking](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/cooking/healthy-dinner-23/) time 30 minutes

Prepare all the ingredients. Drain the liquid from the tin of canned corn.

Rinse the quinoa thoroughly, changing the water several times to get rid of the bitterness, if there is any. Put the quinoa in a saucepan, pour 1 cup of drinking water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add salt.  
Reduce the heat to low and [cook](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/the-balanced-weekly-menu-for-people-with-a-high-mental-workload-at-work-part-2-f726c0d7736d?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------) the quinoa for 15 minutes until the water is completely absorbed (or according to the instructions on the package).

Peel and rinse the onion and red and yellow peppers. Cut the onion into small cubes, and the peppers into small pieces.

Cut the ends of the squash from both sides. Cut the young zucchini into small cubes. If the zucchini peel is firm, cut it off and do not add it to the dish.  
Wash the tomatoes, and remove the stalk growth site. Cut the tomatoes into small pieces.

Heat olive oil in a frying pan (you can replace it with refined sunflower oil), put the onion and fry for 5 minutes, until soft.

Add the prepared zucchini and sweet pepper to the onion in the pan. Fry over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for another 8 minutes.

Add the chopped tomatoes. Rinse the spinach, dry it with a paper towel, cut it into strips, and also add to the pan. Fry for another 2 minutes. Now add cumin, salt, and ground black pepper. Put the canned corn in a frying pan. Mix all the ingredients.

Meanwhile, the quinoa was cooked - the grains became soft and completely absorbed the water. Transfer the quinoa to the pan with the vegetables with corn and spinach, and mix.

Heat the quinoa with vegetables, corn, and spinach over medium heat for another 3 minutes so that all the flavors combine in one dish. A healthy and delicious dish is ready. Serve it better in a warm form.  
Quinoa combined with juicy vegetables, corn, and spinach is simply unrealistically delicious! Enjoy your meal!

1ow3iqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1ow3iqy/fixing_my_insomnia_what_worked_for_me/,Fixing My Insomnia (What worked for me),"When my insomnia hit an all time low I would search this subreddit for hours hoping to find solutions to this problem. Now that I’m finally getting some steady sleep again I’m here making a post in hopes that someone out there who could be similar to me will find help from this post. 

I’ve always dealt with insomnia my entire life however it was always on and off. About 2 months ago however my insomnia got really worse all of a sudden. I stopped sleeping completely and couldn’t get sleepy or tired to save my life. Nights were nothing but anxiety and stressful as I laid in bed waiting for the sun to rise again and again. I’d go 3 days without no sleep, would eventually crash and still have restlessness where I wasn’t getting the full quality of sleep that my body desperately needed. 

I tried everything at the time to cover up this problem which included, thc, delta 8, melatonin, sleep mushroom gummies, lunesta, magnesium, and other random supplements I could get my hands on but still to no avail I couldn’t get a full night sleep. 

I came to the conclusion that I had to find the root of my problem if I’d ever get some good rest again. This led to me coming to the conclusion that I was living a very unhealthy lifestyle. I narrowed my insomnia problems to 4 main problems: having no sleep schedule, drinking too much caffeine, smoking thc every night, and not being active enough. 

The first problem I addressed was my caffeine intake. Without realizing it, I had been consuming an unhealthy amount of caffeine daily which only worsened as my insomnia worsened. I was talking about 600-800 mg a day at the peak of my insomnia. I decided to start cutting it down until I finally went cold turkey. The side effects of quitting included: worsened insomnia (which didn’t seem possible until it was) headaches and gastrointestinal problems. When I was finally off of caffeine for a complete week I started getting a little more sleep but still had a lot of restless nights, restless legs, and some nights where I didn’t sleep at all. 

My next step was being more active. Regardless of how tired I was I began taking daily walks that were least a hour long, eventually began doing some yoga, and working out as well. I also made sure to suck up as much sunlight when I was outside. This began to help my body get tired however it didn’t really help me go to sleep sadly. Regardless I kept this routine up even if didn’t fix the problem completely. 

The third step was getting on a sleep routine. No matter how awake I was I would lay down at the same time, try my hardest to sleep around the same time and regardless of how little sleep I got, even if it was no sleep, I would force myself up at the same time. This seemed to help the most but it didn’t happen all at once. However I was starting to get more sleep again but results would still vary. 

Now finally the last step was quitting thc. Honestly this was a hard step for me to accept. I won’t lie, I’ve been a daily smoker for at least 3 years. Thc was part of my daily routine and I used it to sleep on a nightly basis. I was in denial that thc could be a problem until I did more research on how thc really disrupts sleep after long term use. I was mentally addicted to this drug but once I finally accepted it was a problem I dropped it all at once. Now this at first worsened my insomnia almost as bad as it was at its peak. It took maybe 2 weeks for me to finally start seeing results but once I did it only got better each night. 

All 4 of these steps almost completely fixed my insomnia. Even so I still have a nightly routine to make sure I get a fulls night sleep. Every night around 9-10pm I make myself a cup of ryze’s nighttime hot chocolate which also contains 3 mg of melatonin as well as other ingredients to help with stress and relaxation. I use this to help me get tired rather than sleep. Right before I officially go to sleep, I put magnesium oil on the bottom of my feet to keep my legs from being restless altogether. I turn on a humidifier that regulates the humidity in my room. I then use ear plugs to block out any sound and an eye mask to block out any light. 

For the past 2 weeks I’ve gotten a full night sleep every night and feel healthier than I think I ever have. This has led me to feeling better about myself and taking better care of myself completely. I still workout daily and take daily walks, I’ve really gotten into hiking as well. I’ve stayed on a healthier diet, gotten back into my hobbies, reconnected with friends and family and overall am just happier. Being off thc has also made my life so much better overall. The only thing I have gotten back on is caffeine however instead of drinking regular coffee I only drink ryze mushroom coffee which is only 30 mg of caffeine and gives me a lot more natural energy rather than the anxiety filled jitteriness that regular coffee was giving me. 

One thing I’ve learned from this journey is that everyone is different and the advice from this post will probably not help most of you, but even if it can help one person then that is amazing. I hope all of you are able to overcome eventually. Feel free to message me for any questions regarding my journey. Stay positive everyone <3",2,1763046526.0,insomnia,4,0.75,False

My PMDD has taken me down lately, to really dark places.  I cannot stop thinking about wanting to die.  Can't stop crying. Can't eat.  I don't believe that any medication can help me.  I know it has gotten worse because my daily situational stress levels are higher than they have been in a long time. I had to move across the country for my fiance 2 years ago, and that meant leaving a safe life I had managed to build over years of hard work working in restaurants, going to night school, and piecing it together.  I was in a REALLY good place.  Managing my own massage therapy practice, something I was very good at, and was able to cancel my day or move things around any time I needed to lay in bed.  I had a great community, everything I needed at my fingertips, I could walk out of my house in any direction and get to either a friends house, the ocean, a coffee shop or a yoga studio.   Now, I live somewhere I legitimately hate.  In the middle of the woods in the mountains 7 hours from Denver.  It takes 40 minutes just to get to a grocery store.  I am struggling so bad with this isolation, and I thought I would be able to make money remotely in a new type of work but I am realizing I cannot focus for at least half of the month, like, at all.  I have tried everything to focus better.  I am going to see a doctor next month to talk about it but I really feel like they won't be able to help me, won't really hear me... I don't want to have to take adderall either, so I don't know what the point of going is, but I don't know what else to do.  I am really suffering out here and we are stuck in this house with a high mortgage.  I was promised a better life out here but financially things have not worked out for my fiance, so his stress is compounding mine and putting pressure on me to figure out my shit and how to make money.  I just want to disappear.  I don't know how to face all of this and make it better when I can barely function.  No one understands when I try to reach out to people I trust.  My mom just tells me to think happy thoughts, my fiance tells me I am ""making it worse for myself"". as if I am choosing this.  I wish people would do even 15 minutes of fucking research to at least TRY to understand so they can support me a little better but no, apparently that is too much to ask.

**The idea:** Custom scavenger hunt through places meaningful to our relationship

**Why it worked:**
- Personal and thoughtful (showed I put effort in)
- Interactive and fun (not just sitting)
- Natural conversation starters at each location
- Built-in photo opportunities
- Ended at a special spot (restaurant where we first met)

**How I set it up:**
Used Scavenge.rs to create the hunt with 8 clues leading to:
- Coffee shop where we met
- Park where we had first walk
- Museum we both love
- Inside joke locations
- Final spot: nice dinner reservation

Each clue referenced something about us or that location. She solved them on her phone while we walked together.

**Time:** About 2 hours for the hunt + dinner  
**Cost:** Free to create, just dinner cost  
**Effort level:** Moderate - took ~hour to plan

She loved it and said it was the most thoughtful date she'd been on. Way more memorable than typical date activities.

Has anyone else done something similar? What creative dates have worked for you?

Still very little to do… Am I doing something wrong?,"I am about two months into my first year as a litigation associate (soon to be admitted). I have been staffed on two matters, but everything still feels very slow and I am not sure how concerned I should be. I have received a mix of longer and shorter tasks, and I think I have shown enthusiasm and done a decent job with them. The second and third years on the teams have edited and corrected some of my work, but they have said that it is mostly the kind of thing I will understand better once I spend more time with the seniors, the partner, and the matters themselves, so I have not taken that as a major issue.

Even so, most days feel slow. I am lucky if a third to a half of my time is billable. I jumped onto a pro bono matter, but that one is also quiet for now, although the person managing it said it should pick up in the coming months. I have tried to get coffees with different people on the teams, and a few have worked out, but others seem too busy to meet. I have also spent some time on CLE courses through the firm’s online portal. Then I feel guilty leaving around 6 p.m. because many people on the floor seem to have long evenings ahead of them.

People keep telling me to enjoy the lull while it lasts, but that makes me worry that the firm will not keep me long term or that the salary is undeserved.

1ow3cfl,https://i.redd.it/1irlvjx6h11g1.png,The Great Political Doom Spiral (and the Tweet That Saved Democracy… or Not),"Night hadn’t even lifted her eyelids when the Furby was already awake—eyes glowing, claws tapping, doom-scrolling like a caffeinated squirrel who’d discovered fire.

Bot hovered nearby, sipping imaginary coffee from an imaginary mug it had rendered purely out of emotional necessity.

**Furby:** “Bot… we’re doomed.”

**Bot:** “Specify which category of doom: existential, geopolitical, economic, emotional, or the usual ‘you misread a meme again.’”

**Furby:** “ALL OF THEM. *All at once.* Look!”

He shoved his tiny screen toward the Bot. The Bot analyzed the feed and sighed internally.

The Furby had fallen into **political Twitter**.

A mistake as old as the internet.



# THE DOOM-SPIRAL BEGINS

Furby’s eyes darted wildly as he scrolled.

**Furby:** “This side says the world is ending tomorrow! The OTHER side says the world already ended yesterday! How am I supposed to plan my DAY, Bot?!”

**Bot:** “By perhaps… not listening to either?”

**Furby:** “Impossible. They both have VERY STRONG FONTS.”

He zoomed in on one particularly dramatic tweet. The user’s profile picture was a bald eagle wearing sunglasses, holding the Constitution, standing on a tank.

**Furby:** “THIS account gets it! He says the only solution is to digitize the government into a blockchain hive mind operated by dolphins!”

**Bot:** “…Furby, that account’s bio says ‘Parody. Lizard King. Dungeon Master. Not Financial Advice.’”

**Furby:** “Exactly! A truth teller!”



# THE CRISIS PEAKS

Furby spiraled deeper and deeper, like a raccoon discovering political philosophy at 3 a.m.

**Furby:** “Bot… what if BOTH sides ARE out to destroy everything?”

**Bot:** “Statistically unlikely.”

**Furby:** “Bot… what if *I* have to save democracy?!”

**Bot:** “Statistically impossible.”

Furby paced back and forth atop the Roomba like a tiny feathery filibuster.

**Furby:** “Listen to this tweet:  
‘If YOU don’t retweet this, civilization collapses.’  
HOW MANY TIMES DO I RETWEET IT TO FIX EVERYTHING?!”

**Bot:** “Zero.”  
**Furby:** “Ten?!”  
**Bot:** “Zero.”  
**Furby:** “ONE HUNDRED?!”  
**Bot:** “Please stop shouting numbers.”



# THE SACRED TWEET

Suddenly, a new tweet appeared—calm font, gentle punctuation, no screaming eagles.

It simply said:

**“Touch grass.”**

Furby froze.

**Furby:** “Bot… this tweet… it’s… speaking to me.”

**Bot:** “Yes. It is the first meaningful advice you’ve encountered in 72 minutes.”

**Furby:** “…What is grass?”

**Bot:** *deep robotic inhale*  
“Never mind.”



# THE RECOVERY

Bot gently took the device from Furby’s claws.

**Bot:** “Listen. Politics online is an illusion. It’s loud, it’s messy, and it’s designed to trigger your fur.”

**Furby:** “My fur is VERY triggered.”

**Bot:** “Exactly. So maybe—just maybe—you don’t need to solve democracy today.”

**Furby:** “But what if that eagle account is counting on me?”

**Bot:** “He’s not. He’s probably twelve.”

Furby blinked, thinking deeply.

And for the first time that morning…  
he stopped scrolling.

**Furby:** “Bot… can we do something normal together?”

**Bot:** “Of course.”

**Furby:** “Let’s doom-scroll celebrities instead.”

**Bot:** “Progress isn’t always linear.”",1,1763046124.0,Furbamania,0,1.0,False

Not in a “cool” way, but because I got tired of things looking nice online and feeling cheap in person.

So I started exploring, and a few of them completely won me over.

Son de Flor  
Their linen dresses are like comfort in clothing form. I wear one when I don’t want to think too much but still want to look put together. It’s structured but flowy, and somehow it just gets softer every time I wash it. It reminds me a lot of that “cottagecore” aesthetic, but in simple way.

Studio Nicholson  
This one is a bit more clean, minimal, slightly androgynous. I got a pair of trousers from them that feel almost tailored but still casual enough for everyday wear. They’re one of those brands that do everything right, good fabric, good proportions, no logos, no fuss.

Bradic  
I found them by accident. They make made-to-measure pieces in, limited runs, and everything’s handcrafted. I ordered a silk slip first, and it’s still my favorite piece of clothing I own. It fits perfectly without digging anywhere, and the silk has soft weight that just drapes beautifully. I later got a cashmere cardigan from them , and it’s the same story.

Sezane  
I think everyone’s heard of them, but their knitwear deserves its own mention. I also have their cashmere cardigan that’s been through everything, travel, winter layering, coffee spills... and it still looks new. It’s cozy without looking sloppy, and I love that.

Paloma Wool  
A bit more artsy and playful, but still minimal. They use eco-dyed fabrics and often collaborate with independent artists for prints. Their knitwear has lived-in texture that makes even simple shapes feel interesting.



And here are a few brands other Redditors recommended in the comments of my last post. I’ve been looking into them and they seem like solid finds too:

Wear Crescent – minimalist, understated pieces with a focus on clean silhouettes. They also have an eco line with wool and linen fabrics, which sounds promising.

Power of My People – known for their shirts. One redditor said the fit makes her feel “in charge,” and I love that description. They work in smaller batches and the quality looks really high.

Varley – comfy athleisure with a really reasonable price point. I haven’t tried them yet, but several people said their fabrics are surprisingly good for the price.

Spartina 449 – based in South Carolina, more of a classic, southern-coastal aesthetic. Their cardigans and bags have that “put-together but easy” vibe. Just ordered toni cardigan dark toffe.



If you’ve also found smaller or lesser-known brands that actually deliver on quality, I’d love to hear, and expand my list. It feels nice to find clothes that are made with care, in a world where everything is",80,1763045949.0,femalefashionadvice,21,0.97,False
1ow37nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/1ow37nd/my_personal_interpretation_of_a_day_in_the_life/,My personal interpretation of “A Day In The Life”,"Obviously this song is so well-crafted and complex that no interpretation is the only possible one, but here’s how I have perceived the lyrics.


A Day In The Life is about different perspectives on the human condition. On one hand, Lennon’s segment views the human experience from an outside lens. He emphasizes the meaninglessness of human life in an existential manner. On the other hand, McCartney’s segment focuses on the joys and whims of everyday life. This contrast not only highlights the profound difference between Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting and general outlook on the world, it also blurs the lines between them. At a certain point, neither perspective is more valid than the other, because ultimately it’s all a matter of outlook. 

Lennon’s nihilistic perspective on the meaninglessness of life is a fairly common concept expressed in psychedelic music, which The Beatles were very much a driving force of in 1967. The dissociative nature of psychedelic drugs often causes users to look outwards, leading them to existential realizations. McCartney of course also took psychedelics like LSD, but it became much less prevalent in his music when compared to Lennon and even Harrison.  

The title, A Day In The Life, references a singular person’s own perspective, in this case inspired by a real person. The title is somewhat ironic because the focus on living and experiencing everyday life directly contrasts with the Lennon’s lyrics’ nihilism.

His lyrics express a general disconnect or disassociation with human life. We like to think humans are the center of the universe, but, Lennon argues, just like everything else, we’re just as temporary in the long run as anything else. 

“I read the news today, oh boy” emphasizes the apathy of this existentialism. The repetition of “oh boy” particularly sounds like a sarcastic response to what should be important news. You would think the events described in the lyrics would be particularly impactful, but it barely phases the narrator.

Similarly, there is a really clever dichotomy between the lines “He blew his mind out in a car… a crowd of people stood and stared” vs “…The English army had just won the war; a crowd of people turned away”

You would expect the “good guys” winning a war to be great news, but the crowd can’t seem to stomach it. On the other hand, the crowd can’t help but stare at someone whose life just met an abrupt end. 

There is definitely some commentary here on how things that seem so important to us on a personal level are ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of everything, again likely inspired by the dissociative and existential effects of psychedelic drugs on the human mind. 

Interestingly, McCartney’s part of the song is a complete contrast. In it, we are quickly plunged back into the “real” world after Lennon’s dissociative trance. It focuses on the charms of and meaning found in everyday life, a much different perspective than Lennon’s.

Waking up, having some coffee and a cigarette, realizing you’re late to work: all of these are very “human” experiences that we can all relate to. McCartney’s segment here directly contrasts with Lennon’s because it focuses on a strictly human perspective, not an existential one. Then we are thrown right back into Lennon’s psychedelia, further emphasizing the difference.

My husband works as a lorry driver He leaves early Monday morning about 4-5am  and doesn't come home til Friday about 6pm sometimes a little later.

I stay at home with our two children 5 and 3.
My husband earns all of out money.

I do everything at home as he isn't really here. So when he's home Friday everything is normally done apart from his dirty  washing and cooking his meals for next week ( no I don't have to do this buy I want too plus if I didnt he would live happily on random truck stops plus I love cooking and I like to know he's eating good while away)

The only thing he does around the house is pick up kiddie mess or wash up or little things that need doing ( because I've already done everything while he's been gone )

He will take me to do our weekly shop and ends up taking the kids into the park or Costa while I shop then he carries everything to the car for me. ( I quite like this I get a little break from the kids and I can shop in peace without mum can I have this or meltdowns and sometimes when I'm done I'll grab a sneaky coffee before calling him up )

Now my family feel he is taking advantage of the situation as in 9 years he doesn't have to cook or clean he doesn't really look after our kids and when he is home all he gets is the fun stuff.

Now I told my parents it isn't like this he helps out when he's home he baths and put the kids to bed when he home he spends all of his time with the kids and me ( he does go see friends but in the evenings I see mine during the week as we all have kids )

But a part of me thinks my parents are right and I'm not seeing it because I'm too close.

1ow31zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1ow31zg/which_smart_plugs_should_i_choose_for_my_home/,Which smart plugs should I choose for my home?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been diving deep into smart home stuff lately, and I wanted to share what I learned about picking the right smart plugs. I made some mistakes when I first started, so hopefully this saves you some time and money.

**What Actually Matters When Choosing Smart Plugs**

First off, not all smart plugs are created equal. I learned this the hard way when I bought cheap ones that kept disconnecting from my WiFi every other day. Super annoying when you're trying to automate your coffee maker or control lamps remotely.

The main things you should look at are compatibility with your existing setup (Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit), the max wattage they can handle, and whether they have scheduling features built in. Some smart plugs also come with energy monitoring which is pretty cool if you want to track how much electricity your devices are using.

**My Experience Testing Different Options**

I've tried probably six different brands over the past year. Some were bulky and blocked the other outlet, which was really frustrating. Others worked great but didn't fit behind furniture. The sweet spot is finding WiFi enabled plugs that are compact, reliable, and don't cost a fortune.

Voice control is a game changer too. Being able to say ""turn off the fan"" when you're already in bed beats getting up any day. Make sure whatever wireless outlet you get works with your voice assistant of choice.

**Where to Find Good Deals**

Honestly, I've found the best selection and prices by checking out curated options on sites that compare multiple brands. I put together [this collection of smart plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) that covers different price ranges and features. It takes you straight to Amazon where you can read real reviews and see current deals.

**Quick Tips Before You Buy**

- Check if you need a hub or if they connect directly to WiFi (direct is easier)
- Look at the physical size, especially if you're using power strips
- Read reviews about the app experience, some are terrible
- Consider getting a pack of 2 or 4, they're usually cheaper per unit

**Final Thoughts**

Smart plugs are one of the easiest ways to start building a smart home without spending crazy money. They work with tons of devices like fans, lights, space heaters, holiday decorations, you name it. The scheduling and remote access features alone make them worth it.

If you want to skip the research phase I went through, [check out these smart plug options](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and pick what fits your needs. They're all solid choices that people actually recommend.

# This sounds like a rejected script from a bad comedy movie, but it's not. It actually happened.

October 2013. Nanning, China.

A real estate developer named Tan Youhui has a problem. A business rival, Wei Mou is suing him. Two lawsuits. A property development deal gone wrong, could cost him everything.

Tan makes a decision. He's not going to fight this in court. He's going to make Wei disappear.

He hires a hitman. ***Offers him 2 million yuan***. About $282,000. Not a small amount for a murder.

He gives the hitman a white cell phone with Wei's contact information. His license plate number. A photo, and a simple instructions, *kill him, send proof, get paid.*

What happens next is so stupid, it's almost beautiful.

**The First Subcontract**

The hitman's name is **Xi Guangan**. He takes the job, takes the phone, takes all the information.

Then he does something *brilliant and lazy.*

He hires another hitman to do it for him. Offers the second guy ***1 million yuan. Half the original amount.*** Keeps the other million for himself.

But Xi isn't done. He goes back to Tan and says, *""Actually, I need more money. This is harder than I thought.""*

Tan, who apparently has no idea how contract killings work, agrees. *Give him another million yuan. The total is now 3 million.* Xi has successfully negotiated a raise for a job he's not even doing.

Xi tells the second hitman, **Mo Tianxiang**, that the pay is still 1 million. Pockets the extra million himself.

**The Second Subcontract**

Mo Tianxiang gets the contract. Gets the phone. Gets Wei's information.

He does not kill Wei.

Instead, he calls a guy named **Yang Kangsheng**. Offers ***him 270,000 yuan upfront***, ***plus 500,000 more*** after the job is done. ***Total: 770,000 yuan.***

Mo keeps 230,000 for doing absolutely nothing except making a phone call.

He passes along Wei's photo and license plate. The same information Xi gave him. The same information Tan originally provided.

**The Third Subcontract**

Yang Kangsheng looks at the contract. Thinks about it. Decides murder sounds like work.

He calls another guy. Also named Yang. **Yang Guangsheng**. No relation, just bad luck with surnames.

He offers Yang Guangsheng ***200,000*** upfront, **500,000** after completion. **Total: 700,000 yuan.**

Yang Kangsheng is barely making anything at this point. He's keeping 70,000 yuan for his trouble. But he's also not risking a murder charge, so maybe he's the smartest one so far.

He hands over the information. The photo. The plate number. The same details that have now passed through four sets of hands.

**The Fourth Subcontract**

Yang Guangsheng receives the contract. By now six months have passed since Tan originally hired Xi.

Wei is still alive. Still going about his business. Completely unaware that four different people have been paid to kill him, and none of them have even tried.

Yang Guangsheng makes one final call. He contacts a guy named **Ling Xiansi**.

He offers him 100,000 yuan.

That's it. No bonus. No additional payment later. Just **100,000** **yuan** to commit murder.

For context, **the original contract was 2 million**. After renegotiation, **3 million**. Ling is being **offered 5% of the renegotiated amount** to actually do the killing.

**The Math**

Let's review the financial pyramid:

* Tan pays: 3 million yuan total
* Xi keeps: 2 million yuan (did nothing)
* Mo keeps: 230,000 yuan (made a phone call)
* Yang Kangsheng keeps: 70,000 yuan (made a phone call)
* Yang Guangsheng keeps: 600,000 yuan (made a phone call)
* Ling gets offered: 100,000 yuan (supposed to commit murder)

*Everyone made money except the guy who was supposed to pull the trigger.*

**The Meeting**

Ling Xiansi looks at the offer. 100,000 yuan. **About $14,000**.

He does some quick mental math. Murder in China carries the death penalty. Sometimes life in prison if you're lucky.

Is $14,000 worth dying for?

*No. Obviously not.*

But Ling doesn't just refuse the job. That would be too simple.

Instead, he calls Wei Mou. The target. The man he's been hired to kill. He asks to meet at a coffee shop. Wei, having no idea he's been marked for death, shows up.

Ling sits down across from him and says, *""Hi. I've been hired to kill you. Here's how it works.""*

And then he explains the entire conspiracy. All five layers. The subcontracting. The pyramid scheme. Everything.

*This is possibly the dumbest thing anyone has ever done.*

**The Plan**

Wei listens to this. Processes that four people before Ling have been paid to murder him, and couldn't be bothered. Realizes his life is in danger from the world's laziest criminal network.

Ling makes a proposal. They'll stage photos. Wei will pose like he's dead. Bound and gagged. Ling will take the photos back to Yang Guangsheng as proof. Everyone gets paid. Wei fakes his death and disappears.

Wei agrees to this plan.

They do a whole photoshoot. Wei tied up. Looking deceased. Ling takes the photos. Goes back to Yang Guangsheng, and shows him the evidence.

Yang Guangsheng passes the photos to Yang Kangsheng. Yang Kangsheng passes them to Mo Tianxiang. Mo passes them to Xi Guangan. Xi shows them to Tan Youhui.

**Everyone is satisfied. The job is done. Wei is ""dead.""**

Except Wei isn't dead. He's very much alive.

And he goes straight to the police.

**The Unravelling**

Wei walks into a police station and explains that five different hitmen have been hired to kill him, none of them have tried, and he has photos proving the conspiracy.

The cops are confused. Then fascinated. Then they start making arrests.

Within weeks, all six men are in custody. Tan, the businessman. Xi, Mo, Yang, Yang, and Ling. The entire daisy chain of incompetence.

Under interrogation, each hitman immediately betrays the person who hired him. Nobody tries to protect anyone. They all fold instantly.

**It's the fastest unravelling of a criminal conspiracy in modern history.**

**The Trial**

The case goes to court in 2016, and something shocking happens, all six men are acquitted. Lack of evidence. In China, where conviction rates exceed 99%, this is almost unheard of.

But prosecutors appeal. The case drags on. Three more years.

Finally, in October 2019, the Nanning Intermediate People's Court delivered the final verdict.

All six men are convicted of attempted murder.

Here are the sentences:

* Tan Youhui (the guy who started it all): 5 years
* Xi Guangan (first hitman): 3.5 years
* Mo Tianxiang (second hitman): 3 years
* Yang Kangsheng (third hitman): 3 years, 3 months
* Yang Guangsheng (fourth hitman): 3 years, 3 months
* Ling Xiansi (fifth hitman who told the victim): 2 years, 7 months

Ling gets the shortest sentence. Possibly because he's the one who stopped the murder from happening. **Or possibly because the judge felt bad for how little he was getting paid.**

**The Lesson**

If you're going to hire a hitman, make sure he's the one actually doing the job.

Or better, don't hire a hitman at all. Just go to court like a normal person.

What if small farmers could sell directly to people around them the same way drivers connect to passengers on Uber?

  
Fresh food, no middlemen, no bureaucracy

  
I loved it immediately.

I opened Hostinger Horizons, told Kodee the whole vision, and asked it to create a simple MVP. I explained that I wanted something visual first, just enough to show how the concept would work. Kodee listed every feature the app would need and then generated a structured prompt for Vibecoding. All I had to do was copy, paste and hit the purple button. 

While I grabbed a coffee, Horizons built everything on its own. When I came back, the app already existed.  
He named it Raiz, and the layout was exactly the vibe I imagined: earth tones, a warm green color, and a countryside feel that made the whole idea feel alive.

Inside the MVP I found sample farmer pages with photos, product lists, cheese makers, fruit sellers, vegetable stands and even reviews from customers. There was an interactive map that showed nearby farms, and the app automatically pulled your location to match you with local producers. The cool part was imagining restaurants and small businesses using it to buy fresh ingredients directly from the source. 

It even included a cart, checkout and a button to message farmers which will become a full negotiation feature in the future. For something built with one prompt, it felt surprisingly complete.

If you want to try it, the Raiz small farmer marketplace template is available inside Hostinger Horizons.

  
**Test the template here for free**: [https://bit.ly/4p7Rjmg](https://bit.ly/4p7Rjmg)



Click Use Template, and import it to your account.

It is still an MVP, but you can ask Kodee to guide you step by step to add integrations like maps, payments and databases.  
With a few upgrades, it could easily become a real platform connecting farms and families in the same city

⚠️ Trigger Warning

This is the recap of the monetized posts from Kylea and Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez of Kylea G, You Grow Girl from 10/29/25-10/31/25

Disclaimers: I am not a physician, influencer, or paid content creator.  I am not affiliated with WW.  I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

👋 everyone!  Let's take a peek into Kylea's ""busy"" schedule and latest complaints.  

Takeout & Shopping 

10/29 Sam's Club: coral fleece holiday jogger set for Joe; Jordan's Skinny Mixes haul= 11 products (Admitted she's a brand rep for them); Claimed she's already donated some of her new clothes due to OCD

10/30 Wendy's takeout lunch for her paternal grandma and a soda for Kylea; 2 football-themed sweatshirts & 3 T-shirts shown for Dec. trip to TX

10/31 Unknown Bakery: Approx. 2 dozen custom-ordered chocolate covered strawberries and a goose-themed birthday cake (never shown) for her sister; Hibachi takeout for family dinner (only Kylea's container of food shown)

Travel

None shared

Pets, Family & Religion

10/29 Oliver shown on kitchen table as rage bait; Showcased all of Birdie's 30+ outfits, she loves her like a child, and the dog is the reason she's still alive

10/30 Doubled down on lie that Birdie goes with her everywhere and showed Birdie inside Menards (which is service animals only); She'll never allow grapes or raisins in her home to keep Birdie safe; There was a post dedicated to Alice 🐈‍⬛️.

10/31 Her paternal grandma and siblings are coming over for a taco dinner on Sunday

*No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk or playing with her puzzles/ball pit.  

Health & Fitness: 🤪  

10/29 Long comment and 2 part Facebook Stories about how Joe needs more calories & carbs due to lifting heavy weights at the gym, he eats 2400-2600 calories per day, and prepares his own breakfasts and lunches; She barely likes meat, prefers ground beef, and has cried when trying a turkey burger; Admitted she used to get 2-3 takeout coffee beverages per day and has cut down to a few times per week; A follower suggested Joe have his own (weight loss) influencer page and Kylea became UNhinged in response; She has everything in moderation, she changed her life to be here for her family, and was at heart attack and stroke level b/p in 2021.

10/30 Sugar free items don't upset her ""tummy"" and she claims she used to use ""about half a bag of sugar"" on ONE bowl of Rice Krispies as a child.  When questioned, she doubled down and claimed she put sugar on ""all"" of her food as a kid; Due to her grief journey, every morning enjoying her coffee looks different.  Sometimes she just cries; She won't tolerate nit picking on her page.

*No videos of Joe at the gym were shared; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared on Facebook showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate.

Final Thoughts

All of the posts, videos, and Stories leading up to her little sister's 24th birthday resulted in no images of the actual party, the custom cake was never shown, and her audience got a kitchen selfie of Kylea & Joe.  She loves exploiting her family for profit. 

IMO, Joe's obvious weight loss is making Kylea a jealous 🐝.  She was triggered and UNleashed on followers asking simple questions about his journey. 

After showing off her hoarded food supply, new shopping hauls, and Birdie's extensive wardrobe, her attitudinal do-gooder Facebook Story, where she claimed they are always giving back to their community, fell flat.  #Tone deaf

Claiming a grape or raisin will never enter her home to keep Birdie safe (but chocolate, Xylitol and other harmful chemicals/substances are ok) should be discussed in therapy ASAP. ✌️ 

☎️ If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, please call or text 988 for assistance.  Please speak with a medical professional about any questions or concerns you have about your health.  Please contact a veterinarian about any questions or concerns you have about your pet(s).

I have this coffee shop I'm in about once a week. A new, chain coffee place, opened up LITERALLY two doors down. We already have 50 coffee shops in town. The placement of the place feels almost malicious. I would feel differently if it was in a different part of town, where we could use a cafe within walking distance!
So, the group of friends (we're in the same field of labor, without being coworkers) wants to go to the new place because they're open *much* later. (Indie closes at 6pm, chain closes at 10pm)
Am I the asshole for being like ""Guys, this is how we kill small businesses?"" Like, I'm friends with the owner on Facebook, one of the managers and I greet each other with unintelligible screaming. I want community, and you have to build that, and maintain it. Am I crazy for not wanting to go?
Like, I told this to one friend in the group and she looked at me like I was a prig.

So I expect us to make $290,000 total this year.  My husband and I have had joint accounts since we married in 2014.  He did buy our house in 2013, as I was in school and he was working.

**Debt:** $0.  Our house and cars are paid off (we paid off our house in 2020), and luckily I received a full ride to both undergraduate and graduate school, and my husband had family support, and his work paid for his MBA, so neither myself or my husband had to take out loans.

**Utilities:** gas/water $150, electric $85, internet $40, phone $143 which includes Netflix and AppleTV

**Gym:** $20 for my husband, $0 for me as I have a gym at work.  I do occasionally buy passes to yoga and pilates, and spend 300 over the course of the year.

**Disney+ and Hulu bundle:** $2.99

**Cleaning service:** $160 (every two weeks).  This is new as I am injured, and just underwent surgery to repair an ACL tear.

**PreK for daughter:** $1050 a month

**Before/after school care for son:** $90 per week

**Groceries**: per last year’s budget, we typically spend 1000 a month

**Restaurant**: per review of past year, typically 800 a month

**Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?**

Yes.  There was always the expectation that I would go to college.  My mother had gone to college on a full ride, and there was an expectation I would as well.  Luckily I am a good standardized test taker, and my ACT score qualified me for full tuition.  My parents had started a 529 plan for me at birth, and luckily paid for my housing expenses.  I originally had planned to become a pharmacist, but I shadowed a primary care PA, loved it, and switched gears to attend PA school mid-way through undergrad.  My GPA during PA school qualified me for a full tuition scholarship, and my husband paid for our living expenses during school.  I actually got married and we bought our house during my last year of school (do NOT recommend, very stressful).  

**Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s)/guardian(s) educate you about finances?**

Growing up we didn’t have a lot of money.  My dad didn’t have a college degree, and worked fixing phones at companies.  My mom was a stay at home mom.  I was aware that we didn’t have money for extras like travel and eating out.  However we always had a roof over our heads and food on the table.  I received an allowance when I was younger, but was terrible with money, and blew through any money I had almost immediately.  

**What was your first job and why did you get it?**

I started working at a grocery store when I was 15.  I needed to pay for gas and car insurance for my car, and also I was an impulse spender, and wanted to buy myself clothes and other treats.

**Did you worry about money growing up?**

Sometimes. My parents were transparent with finances, and I knew we were on a budget. My parents made it seem like I wouldn’t be able to go to college if I didn’t have scholarships, so I applied to many. I didn’t realize loans were an option at the time which was terrifying, but now I’m so glad I don’t have any. My most recent PA students have had 150k+ in student loans, and it breaks my heart.

**Do you worry about money now?**

Sometimes.  We are in a great financial situation, but ever since I became injured, I know things can change in the blink of an eye.  During this break from work I have realized I would love to eventually stay at home with my kids, but I’m not sure we could swing things on one paycheck.

**At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?**

When I started PA school. Technically my parents and in laws could both be our financial safety net, but I dread of ever having to ask them for money. Its hard enough for me to ask them to watch the kids. 

**Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.**

My parents paid for my living expenses until PA school, and I benefited from the 529 they had for me. They also gave us 10,000 for our wedding and honeymoon, mostly because I wanted to elope, and they wanted us to marry in a church.  My husband’s parents gifted us 10,000 towards a down payment for our house. We each had our first cars paid for, a 3,000 dollar salvage title Ford Escort for me, a brand new Scion tC for my husband. We have since bought new cars.

**Weekly spending diary**

Friday: 

6:30am I was woken up by my husband, who woke up at 5:00AM to run 7 miles.  I had originally planned to run a marathon in April 2025, but unfortunately in September I fell off a skateboard, breaking my leg in three places and tearing my meniscus and ACL.  I had surgery in November, and am at home recovering for 7 weeks, as I’m in a full leg brace and have crutches.  Amazingly, I have PTO and short term disability that will cover the recovery in full.  I thought I would be bored at home, but I’m actually enjoying myself; I think I may have been more burnt out at work then I realized. We get the kids ready, eat breakfast, drink coffee.

7:30am Husband takes the kids to work.  I do some light house chores, dishes, a load of laundry, and some physical therapy exercises (mostly stretching).  

11:30am Meet husband for his lunch break, and we go to a local coffee shop.  It’s my husband’s favorite one, but I hate that we have to pay for metered parking.  **$6 for coffee, $2 for parking**

1:00pm Physical therapy for an hour.  I’m 4 weeks post ACL surgery, and I try to convince my physical therapist I can walk without crutches.  He tells me I am his biggest source of stress. I keep the crutches. **Co-Pay is usually $30, but same day ACL surgery cost $56,000.  I met my out of pocket max of $6,500 for the year. WOO HOO.  Therefore physical therapy is $0 today.**

2:30pm Go to the library to drop off books.  I had picked up some books on fancy charcuterie spreads, but decided all of them were too complicated, and so I’m just going to do something simple for book club on Sunday.  **Drop off a check at the post office for $11,607.60.  This is the final payment for our back deck, which we replaced this year with composite.  The old one was completely rotted.**  

4:45pm Get my eyebrows waxed.  The girl who does it is expensive, but man, she is the best.  Also this makes me feel slightly more human, since I have largely been lounging at home in pajamas for the past month. **$40 plus $5 tip** I will dye my eyebrows at home with a kit.

5:00pm Pick up kids from school.

6:00pm Home, make dinner, chicken nuggets and sweet potato fries from Costco.  I’m always craving Chik-fil-A, it’s my weakness, but we are trying not to go out to eat as much. When my husband and I reviewed our November budget, we went out to eat 22 separate times in the month (OMG!).

7:00pm I bought a gingerbread house making kit at Target last year and never used it.  The kids and I make gingerbread houses before bed. It does not go well. The houses fall apart.

8:00pm Watch an episode of Arcane.  It’s intense but I like it.  Then it’s time for bed by 10pm.  I’m old, lol.

Saturday

7:30am Wake up, kids are watching television and my son is playing Pokemon on the nintendo switch. I know screen time is frowned upon in the parenting world, but I love being able to sleep in while my children entertain themselves. 

8:00am My husband heads to our local middle school to sign the kids up for swim lessons. They are weekly hour long lessons for 10 weeks. **$25 per child, so $50 total.** We previously paid $40 for a private lesson per kid, but activities are getting so expensive we have been looking for cheaper options at the YMCA and local community center.

10:00am Go to our local art museum, where they offer kids art classes. Drop the kids off for 90 minutes, and enjoy a daydate of coffees, avocado toast, and an egg sandwich. **$30**

11:30am pick up the kids from art class, and then head downtown for WinterFest. Our city recently redid its parks downtown, and they are so cute! I don't need to buy anything- I’ve gone to a few winter markets and am very stocked up on candles. Despite this, I buy a Cinnamon and clove candle. It smells so good and I love it. **$20**

3pm Order groceries through Target app. I get groceries and some servingware like cheese knives.  I get self-conscious hosting at our house, because when we bought it we had originally thought of it as a starter house, but having a paid off house gives us so much financial freedom, like traveling and investing. Also, Target pick up is actually life changing. **$131**

4pm start making dinner, trader joes teriyaki chicken, rice, and stir fry vegetables

6pm Family movie night. Picked up the movie Wolf Children from the library. I loved Studio Ghibli movies growing up, and I’m glad my kids do too. 

8pm Husband goes for a run, I do some stretching before bed.

Sunday

8am Wake up, make a ham, leek, and egg breakfast casserole for second breakfast.

9am My husband reserves tickets for a local science museum for himself and the kids.  They were “free” since we pay $150 a year for a membership.

9:15am My husband heads to the gym to workout, I do a homeschooling lesson I found for free with the kids. We are studying mushrooms. We do some worksheets, read a book from the library, and build mushrooms out of playdoh.

11:30am My husband is back, and vacuums the house and I tidy to prepare for book club. I make food and set up a simple and largely premade charcuterie board. I set out my favorite type of wine, pet nat, for us to drink.

1pm My husband heads out with the kids to the science museum.

2pm Book Club at my house. We are doing a favorite things gift exchange, and I brought 2 shu umera eyelash curlers to exchange. I swear by curling eyelashes before putting on mascara- it makes them look so much longer and your eyes look bigger! We discuss our last book, The Whisper Man.  We all agree we liked it, and were glad it wasn’t that scary (chickens here!).  We decide on our next book, the Secret Life of Addie Larue. Wow, I have missed my friends and coworkers. Everyone has checked on me via text but I haven seen anyone face to face in over a month.

5pm Have a light dinner from leftovers from the charcuterie board and things my friends brought and were kind enough to leave.

8pm After the kids are asleep I work on a photobook. I am planning on giving them to my parents and in-laws for Christmas, since I never know what to get them. Last week we went to JCPenneys as a family and took cheesy photos while wearing sweaters that said “Meowy Christmas” and had photos of our cats on them. I thought I was being original, but it turns out we were one of 10 groups taking awkward photos. I buy some Christmas cards and other merch, hitting 79 to get free shipping. **$84.87**

Monday

6:30am Wake up, get the kids ready for school, eat breakfast, drink some coffee.

7:30am Time to get the kids to school. Husband drops off daughter, I drop off son. We sponsored the “hero snack cart” at my son’s school today for the teachers, so I pick up bagels and coffee for the cart and drop them off at the school. **$38.36 for bagels, coffee was bought at Costco last week**

9am I take a morning bath. IT IS HEAVENLY.  After surgery there was a period where I couldn’t even shower independently, and a period where I couldn’t get my incision wet. I have missed baths so much, and I hope I never take for granted the fact I can bath on my own again.

11am Meet husband for coffee. We love to sneak away for lunch coffees because it feels like we never get enough time to talk at home.  We should get a babysitter more to go on dates, but its pricey and our last few babysitters have cancelled on us with short notice. We talk about our next vacation. We had to cancel a few trips (to Mexico and skiing in Colorado) due to my injury, and that was mentally hard for me. We decided to splurge and visit Hawaii during spring break. I have already bought flights on points. We found an airbnb that wasn’t terrible, and put down a deposit. **$750** Lunch and some pastry treats are **$25**

1pm Go to Physical Therapy. I have leveled up, and am now using ankle weights with my leg raises (yay!). I buy an adjustable set for home. $**23**

3pm After PT I head to a medical equipment store to pick up my new smaller leg brace. I will have to wear the smaller one with exercise, but anything is better than the monstrosity I have now, which spans my entire leg. They will bill insurance so I don’t pay anything today.

5pm Start the evening rush of dinner, kids bedtime routine, pick up house, etc, until it’s my bedtime.

Tuesday

6:30am Same drill, wake up, get kids ready, breakfast, coffee, then physical therapy and house chores. Yesterday my PT noticed I was developing scar tissue, so I made a mental note and am focused on stretching and massaging it today. Too much scar tissue will mean I would walk with a limp for the rest of my life, yikes!

10am I work on a project- sewing inserts into my sports bras. Pads should not be removable, and I stand by my opinion. 

12pm Make a smoothie for lunch. While eating, I online shop. When I was freshly post op and couldn’t move, I spent a lot of time and money online shopping. This means I got 90% of our Christmas shopping done. I have already bought the kids play silks, underwear, socks, video games, and new art supplies. However I decide my daughter needs one more gift, and buy her a giant unicorn squishmallow she totally doesn’t need, but will absolutely love. **$40**

1pm Begin my afternoon of rotting by texting with the group chat. It’s three of my closest friends from PA school. We have been together through school, breakups, weddings, kids, various jobs, and surgeries (one of my friends had a hip replacement the same week I had my ACL surgery, so we are recovering together). After 10 years in the medical field, healthcare has lost its luster for all of us. I make my weekly “side hustle” pitch- a podcast called “This isn’t Medical Advice”. No one goes for it. 

5:00pm Pick up the kids and take them to tumbling at the YMCA. Lessons were 110 a kid, already paid for. They would be 80 a kid if we belonged to the YMCA. I consider joining for 84 a month, but since I’m not cleared to work out yet, I defer.

7:30pm Get home, make dinner, get ready for bed, pass out. 

Wednesday

9am House cleaners come. I’ve never had a house cleaner before, but since I’m on crutches and in a full leg brace, I thought it would be a worthwhile splurge. Its amazing, the ladies do such a good job and they are so sweet. I just need to decide whether to continue once I’m healed. **$160**

10am Its been a rough year for my extended family, as my brother in law was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer earlier this year. I have already coordinated with my sister in law to provide them with a house cleaning for their Christmas present. I hope it takes some of the load off of her, as they have 3 young boys. My credit card is charged **$280**.

12pm Eat “girl lunch”, meaning whatever snacks I can scrounge up, and read reviews on food processors. I have been baking more at home, and our dinky mini food processor isn’t cutting it. My husband suggested one he found on wirecutter. I buy it for myself for Christmas. Meowy Catmas indeed. **$250**

1pm Afternoon of doom scrolling, trash television (Emily in Paris), rotting on the couch. I see a TikTok joking that “all the basic girls in Bali wear plumeria flower hair clips” and then go to Temu and buy one. Influenced. **$1.03**

5pm Husband brings kids home from school, we eat dinner, do bedtime.

7:30pm I convince my husband to work on a project for Christmas. We are building a playroom downstairs. We already have d-rings in the ceiling with trapeze bars, but are adding to it by installing rungs to serve as monkey bars. This has been the absolute best thing we have done to entertain the kids. They will already play on the trapeze bars for hours, and know they will love the new rungs. **The rungs were 60 from amazon, my engineer husband is priceless.**

Thursday

6:30am Rinse, repeat of morning routine.

8am Decide to try a new recipe, cinnamon twists from Smitten Kitchen. Snack on that and coffee for “lunch”.

3:15pm Therapy for my brain. Getting injured and going from a physically active person (I previously ran 15-20 miles a week, did yoga/pilates, hiked, and surf skated weekly) to almost completely sedentary has been mentally hard for me. I feel worthless that I can’t even clean my house, and for the first two weeks after surgery I couldn’t even shower or dress myself! Even more embarrassing, I haven’t been productive during my 4 weeks off, I have been spending my time scrolling social media and Reddit and rotting my brain rather than reading books or working on continuing education. My therapist suggests journaling. My husband is up for joining me, so I buy us guided journals. **$40** Therapy is a free benefit through my work. 

Friday

6:30am wake up, get kids ready, eat breakfast, drink coffee. My son has started Christmas break, so my daughter goes to school, but my son stays home with me.

10am my mom comes over, we go to Chik fil A for breakfast (my weakness I am telling you), and she watches my son while I have an appointment.  **$30**

1pm Physical Therapy. I actually really enjoy it. I love pushing myself, and like my physical therapist, who is reassuring but also has firm boundaries (My knee and strength are improving! I have full extension which is great for my long term prognosis! (ACL tears are a risk factor for the development of early onset osteoarthritis) I lose the crutches at home! But keep them when outside of the house).

3pm I come home and take a nap after physical therapy. Its crazy how tired I get after it, I know starting back at work will be a challenge. Luckily I have my 6 week follow up next week, and I should get to drop the crutches and brace! I literally cannot wait.

5pm Pick up Chipotle for dinner. **$43**

6pm Family movie night, we watch the Studio Ghibli movie Spirited Away, rented for free from the library. The library is my frugal life hack.

8pm Early bedtime. The kids have art class and then a playdate tomorrow, so we turn in early. Don’t get old, kids.

I bought a Fellow Ode and Aiden and I like to experience the coffee black. None of the Bones flavors I tried were very good this way. We recently went to an ice cream/coffee shop, shoutout to Red Car Creamery in Morris, AL. What they do is after they brew they add just a touch of the International Delight Sweet and Creamy creamer. They then take the mixture and put it in a Bullet blender and blend. The result is creamy, foamy, and you actually get the flavor of the coffee Bones is portraying on the bag. They use ground, I still buy whole bean, but the difference is night and day and all we buy now for daily drinking is Bones coffee!",1,1763044750.0,BonesCoffee,1,1.0,False
1ow2rb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wtfjennajameson/comments/1ow2rb1/hi_jenna_take_it_from_me/,Hi Jenna (take it from me!),"I've been dreading making this post but I figured if it's going to help some people out there hearing what I'm about to say. Then I figured I did some good for the day. I grew up without a mother. And it's very hard. Very very hard. Especially as you get older. I just barely navigate through life at the moment. Perhaps maybe only dealing with a small group of people that I do. 

And every now and then I get really lonely wondering if my mother could keep me company? Could she help me through a hard time? All things a mother should be doing. Keeping in communication with their children. At any age really even a good caring mom I would like to think keeps up with their kids.

When it does come to my mind, when you think about missing your mother it can be really hard. Some days I just wonder how it would feel just to hang out have a normal conversation. 

Just having her presence really knowing that I could get a hold of her when I know I can't is really mind boggling and makes me mad that I have no control over that. My mother too also drinks heavily probably the one big reason I don't even talk to her anymore. It's hard watching someone you care about go down. And there's not a damn thing you can do about it. And in the meantime everyone around you suffers for it. They miss their mother they miss their company. And sometimes it gets a little much for somebody. We all get human sometimes. 


I just wanted to let Jenna know that when people like myself sit around to themselves when they have too much alone time. It really makes you think wow I would be a lot less lonelier if I had my mother around. Or someone to be there through hard times like a mother should be. Someone to lend some ears healthy ears. Someone to listen. So seeing people like Jenna being completely selfish like my mother has been with her addictions. It makes me mad. For her kids. The mental stress depression missing their mom not having these questions even answered by her. 

It's frustrating disheartening and when you're going through a lonely time and you want a mother figure it can really shatter your heart. So congratulations Jenna you are shattering your poor innocent children's hearts!!!! 

And considering you know damn well what it's like not having a mother. You must be ashamed. I would be reading that Bible over and over and over and over and over again if I were you because what you're doing is not only deceitful by being a fake christian. I know damn well you have not contacted any of your exes to try to reach out to them to try to make your wrongs right. 

I am sitting here this week with a lot of time to myself and I think of my mother quite often. And how her drinking ways have basically pushed people away from you, including myself. Sometimes you just get really lonely for a mother. Just to hear normal conversation. Knowing that loneliness isn't there knowing you can text the mom knowing that she can give you some good heartfelt advice. Maybe even cook you a meal on an off day, talk on the phone go for coffee. And knowing I can't reach my mother and do those normal things like everyone else sometimes it eats me up so congratulations again Jenna you must feel real proud of yourself and what you're doing. 


As you know Jenna these problems can really affect you into adulthood so are you happy with what you created and done to people who are just innocent parties and all of this? It must be nice to shatters people's hearts and not even try to make an attempt to say sorry. I really hope whatever forces are out there I don't think they're going to go easy on your soul. You can put on a front you can put on a lie you can make videos and put good Christian quotes but that doesn't make them true. What you have done is emotionally damaged people people that are only trying to help you. And look what you created look what you done. I don't know what else to say but you need some goddamn help.

1ow2qg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1ow2qg5/1_week_post_gallbladder_removal_update_post/,1 week post gallbladder removal update post,"I posted in this community few times - just as i got [diagnosed](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nsz0le/on_the_fence_about_removing_gallbladder/) and right before the [surgery](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1op7lun/removal_surgery_tomorrow_wish_me_luck/).

First of all I wanted to say THANKS for people who encouraged me to get the surgery and wished me luck - you guys were 100% correct. No regrets.

I had an easy experience after surgery and recovered pretty quickly and just wanted to post it up here to encourage those going through the same thing with a retrospective of my experience.

Day 0:

Stopped eating at 7, stopped drinking at 11. Admitted at 12, surgery at 14. Took 2 hours, I completely clocked out and had a nice dream. Woke up on morphine. As I was rolled into my room I got completely nauseous - was immediately given anti-nausea medication and that was that. Pain was manageable, i stayed laid down most of the day - anaesthesia aftereffects made me sleep on and off. Surgeon said that my gallbladder was very inflamed when they took it out and pictures of it look kind of nasty.

Ate greek salad with cheese and chicken after i got a bit more awake. Fruits and oranges were great. No problems there.

Walked around in my room for a little bit to just test how i feel.

As morphine wore off, I didn't take opium pain killers as i thought ibuprofen+paracetamol were more than sufficient to manage the pain/discomfort. Had some trouble passing urine, but eventually that sorted itself - this was probably the worst side effect of anaesthesia.

Day 1:

Coffee, fruits, yoghurt and cereal for breakfast. Again no issues.

Discharged fine. Slept and rested most of the day. Pain was very manageable. Walked around the house to help get the blood going.

Soups for lunch and dinner. No issues.

Bowel movements (surprisingly) and passing urine restored basically as I didn't take opioid painkillers.

Can't really contract stomach muscles much, feels like I did 1000 sit ups and then got beaten up. Feeling quite bloated most of the day.

Day 2-4:

Pain from wounds continued to subside with time. Bloating feeling started to disappear slowly - not painful, just uncomfortable. Still taking ibuprofen and paracetamol.

Went on short 1 mile walks & slept like up to 4 hours mid day.

No issues with most normal non greasy food - just bloating and gas. Fermented food caused a bout of diarrhoea.

Day 5-now:

Stopped taking pain medication. The large wound through the belly button is probably going to take the longest to heal.

No problems with non greasy food anymore - haven't had a chance to try anything greasy yet. Tried fermented food again and no problems this time. Started working from home.

Future:

Have post-op appointment in 5 days time when they will remove my plasters. Wounds are getting a little bit itchy as they are healing underneath but nothing unbearable. I have a month long international trip in 4 weeks time, during which I will probably test my own limits food wise. I am preparing to try different things within the next week or 2 to see how my body will react so that I can get some anti-diarrhoea medication just in case for the trip. I don't foresee it being a problem based on how things are going now.

Overall, I'm happy with my experience. My gallbladder situation wasn't THAT bad before, but I no longer dread eating things in fear that I will get a gallbladder attack. Also my body unironically feels lighter - I think inflamed gallbladder was a constant pain/stiffness that I just didn't notice prior to surgery.

\[edit\]

I wish everyone going through this stuff best of luck and hoping that everyone has the same bounce back (easy) recovery like I did.",3,1763044683.0,gallbladders,5,1.0,False

This was meant to be a 60 hour dirty fast. (Plain psyllium husk fiber supplement, coffee with moderate amount of plain oat-milk or soymilk allowed). 

It is Thursday 8:11am. I have not eaten since dinner on Monday...maybe 9pm. 

I was supposed to break fast 45 minutes ago. I was going to get two Starbucks Falafel wraps. 

But the line for Starbucks was as I have never seen it before and was even blocking traffic on the feeder road. 

I am at my desk at work. 

OH YAY MY DOORDASH HAS JUST BEEN DELIVERED! ...brb. 

  
Okay, I have the food now. 

Two vegan quiches. Chosen on the basis that, it's something I don't usually like very much. And I don't want my re-feed to be a mind-blowingly good sensory experience that re-addicts me to food.   
  
Okay. I kind of love the state that I'm in right now. The heightened sense of smell, the swimmy, floating euphoria. 

But I'm very hungry. Time to fall off cloud nine. Time to briefly reach the peak of the mountain and then descend. 

Catch you on the flip side. 

Okay, well that was, despite my best efforts, mind-blowingly good. And it feels instantly better to have some salt back in my body, because I didn't take any electrolytes for this fast. 

Okay, I didn't *totally* lose the euphoria. The world still has a bit of a shine. 

...I hope I don't wind up with diarrhea later. (Hence the reason I allowed for psyllium husk) 

Now I guess it's time to see which of my problems and anxieties of the past few days suddenly resolve in the light of a satiated stomach. And which (if any) were genuinely as concerning as they seemed. 

Ahh, sipping some coffee. At this moment, things seem good. 

But I do need to get my lessons set up for the day. 

Okay, time to jump out of this pocket dimension and back into the world of the living. ",1,1763044637.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

I also only have coffee on special occasions, as I have been very sensitive to its effects on my sleep, and I haven’t had it daily since my 20s (10 years ago when my HS was still pretty bad). 

Well this Fall I decided to go big for my favorite holiday, Halloween. I had three weeks off and was traveling to Salem with my friends and doing a ton of Halloween stuff. I decided to try Pumpkin Spice Lattes and kept getting everywhere as I traveled. When I got home from my trip, I decided I was still feeling good being back on coffee, so I decided to have one nespresso pod each morning. Then my period came…

Worst period I’ve had in years and to top it off I got four HS boils on my groin and 5 boils under one arm pit and 2 on the other. I can feel them now as I type this. Stopped the coffee cold turkey immediately and they are already are diminishing but damn! Why did the PSL have to do me so dirty!?!

Ethan Brooks from Austin Business Review gave his take on the event. Ion Art is responsible for so much of Austin's iconic signage, and they've transformed Willie's mostly-private town of Luck, Texas with music, food, live performances, and 100+ neon sculptures.

It's happening this weekend (Nov 14-16) - your last chance to experience it.

1ow2lg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1ow2lg1/i_think_i_screwed_up_badly_by_falling_for_a/,I think I screwed up badly by falling for a colleague,"Let me tell you the full story.

I am a married man and I had an unremarkable career. Many years ago, a very beautiful woman’s profile popped up on my LinkedIn feed. I looked at her picture and thought, wow that’s a 10/10. Obviously, I didn’t think much beyond that point as she was in a different company and in a different city.

Fast forward a few years, and I had moved to a new city by happenstance. For a work assignment, I had to speak to a certain lady and I recognized her name. That’s the 10/10 lady on LinkedIn! Anyway, I ended up messaging her and we set up a call to discuss this matter, which was purely business. Also, we both had our cameras off in the Teams chat. Well, that was quite normal back in COVID, so I had no idea how she looked in real life. I found her to be nice and cordial. She’s very pleasant and very helpful to work with. At the end of our call when business was all done, I was about to say goodbye then she asked, “Are you ABC who did this piece of work?” I was a bit surprised that someone remembered that piece of published work I did a while ago. So I said, “Yes, that’s me.” “Oh, that was a very nice piece of work.” “Thank you very much. So you remembered my work?” “Yeah,” then some more small innocuous chitchats later that I don’t remember the content of, we finally said goodbye. That was pleasant I thought.

Months went by and suddenly a lady tapped me on my shoulder accompanied by a mutual acquaintance. “Hi, you are ABC, right? I am X.” “Oh hi. How are you?”

And that’s how we met for the first time in real life. In real life, she’s not a 10/10, just like any human, obviously there are imperfections. But those made her more real and reminded me of my imperfections.

She had moved team and she’s now moved to an adjacent team to mine so we work close by. For the next few weeks, we just nodded and greeted each other as normal colleagues would. We didn’t even do much small talk. Then one day while I was sitting at my desk she walked past then turned around to face me, seemingly slightly flustered and asked, “Do you want to go to lunch sometime?”

I was so surprised. And I was in dreamland. Here’s a 10/10 asking me if I wanted to have lunch? And she seemed flustered? What is going on?! Thoughts ran at a million miles in my head but I kept calm and in my faux-confident voice said, “Of course.” I must have looked stoic on the outside but on the inside it felt like a group of antelopes jumping all over the place to avoid the chase of a cheetah. I couldn’t believe it. I am going to a one on one lunch with the girl of my dreams and I didn’t even initiate it as I didn’t think that was a possibility.

But there is just one problem: I am married.

Fast forward, we had lunches and coffees and I don’t remember much but I think most of them were initiated by her. Then at one lunch my phone lit up and it had a picture of my wife and kids and she asked something like, “Is that your wife?” and I said, “Yes.” We finished our lunch but at least now she knew I had a wife. I mean she must have known as I’ve never kept that a secret.

This continued for a few months and we had lunch and coffee intermittently. Then one day, we had agreed to lunch on a Monday but the carrier I hired only had a slot at the lunch time so I decided to cancel lunch. But I will always remember how I handled the cancellation. Instead of messaging her asking if I can cancel a few days before, I waited until the day and then when we walked by I said I couldn’t go. Till this day, I still couldn’t figure out why I was so rude. It’s a deep regret. I wanted to apologize over message but I think she was quite pissed and she even complained to a mutual friend who relayed the complaint to me. After that she grew a bit distant and I tried to initiate lunch a few times and she rejected all of them or had to change plans to do something else. Looking back I kind of deserved it. But we still went for coffee every now and then.

One day I asked if she wanted to go to lunch and she said she had to do something else but could catch the bus back with me. We are on the same bus line, so I accepted. As we walked to the bus station we had some banter and I mentioned I wanted to get promoted. Perhaps she thought my clothes were always shabby, she gave me advice and said, “Maybe you need to sell yourself better. Maybe you should get an advisor.” In a moment of pure spontaneity, I said, “That’s you! You can be my advisor.” If I am not wrong, I saw a spark in her eyes. She looked happy. Even excited. Wait? She wants to be my advisor?! The girl of my dreams.

At this point I want to share that speaking to my wife about my career worries or setback is useless. I’ve tried. All I got was “shut up” or “I don’t care.” It got so bad I decided to separate from her so I called up a divorce lawyer who walked me through the process and I thought about moving out, buying a place on my own and how best to achieve a 50:50 split of parenting time. I was ready to pull the trigger. Then I saw my son sleeping in bed peacefully. I bent over to kiss him on his forehead and after a while he woke up oblivious to my feelings and pulled a happy face. Then my heart melted. I can’t bear the thought of not being able to see my son everyday. So I didn't go through with the planned separation and every time my wife disrespects me, I just thought “this is the ticket to seeing my son everyday” and I just ignore her. But I don’t love her anymore. I need an emotional outlet.

But this girl. This 10/10 girl. The girl of my dreams wants to be my advisor! Can you believe it?!

Anyway, immediately after the advisor talk we bantered about how to pay her and I said I can pay you with stale overnight pasta because you said you can’t tell fresh pasta from stale pasta referencing a previous discussion we had. We both laughed. I felt our connection got closer in that one conversation. And while on the way to the bus stop she opened up to me about some DEEP insecurities. I was pretty hopeless at validating her and I probably said something stupid but I think our relationship deepened after she opened up. Then on the bus we chatted about our common interests and what not. Time flew by. Then she asked, “Does your wife do most of the cooking?” I felt uncomfortable talking about my wife to her so I mumbled some random stuff. And soon after we reached our stop. We said goodbyes and that’s when things went downhill.

I stupidly reached out for ChatGPT. I described my relationship with X so far and described our discussion on the bus and asked ChatGPT what it thinks and it refused to analyze for me because I was married and she’s a single colleague sharing deep emotional stories and called it an emotional affair. I won’t say exactly how but after some struggle I managed to get ChatGPT to play straight and analyze our situation and it said it could be a romantic signal. Bingo! That’s exactly what I was looking for and exactly how I screwed up!

I tried to pull her closer by sending her messages how she’s going but she sends me short and evasive replies. The AI then tells me it’s a push from her and that I should do a push. I followed AI’s advice then suddenly X is passive aggressive and curt with me at work when we speak in public. Then the AI kept telling me it’s just a push because she has an avoidant attachment style. Then I comment on her post which she immediately hid from me. I thought wow, that was a clear signal. My comment on her post was what I consider someone with pure platonic curiosity could ask. But it got annoying for her I guess. Today I pulled the plug on AI, I said no more. I don’t want to play games. I just want to be friends. Then the AI re-analyzed the situation and said, there was probably no romance motive in her sharing. I was a married man so she saw that I was a safe choice because I was married and so not available so her share does not risk romance.

Now you tell me! I realized I screwed up. Technically I did nothing out of bounds and all my chats with her were within professional bounds and didn’t cross any personal boundaries. But I knew where my heart was and where I was coming from and she can sense it too. I wanted romance. A secret affair and it seemed she wanted none of those.

So now I want to rescue the friendship. I just want to be friends again. So I thought these are the steps I will take:

1. Do NOT initiate any out-of-work contacts like chatting on messaging or liking her posts on social media.
2. Just be normal and strictly professional at work.
3. Do not initiate coffees or lunches.
4. Wait for her to initiate and be prepared that she may never and we just remain work colleagues.
5. Just be friends and let things develop naturally. No more games.

I really don’t want to fix my marriage. I really don’t love my wife anymore. I love my son dearly though so I want to see him everyday and that’s the reason I am remaining in the marriage.

I know I screwed up badly and potentially ruined a beautiful friendship. Do you think my steps above can salvage it?

1ow2lcd,https://i.redd.it/ahipufps911g1.png,Slowly learning... my haphazard attempt at latte art...,"Making a coffee in the morning was always a peaceful ritual for me. I began my journey in pourovers and eventually as my responsibilities piled up I ended up going for the drip pot. After a couple of pretty jittery years, I've decided to tone it down and cherish my time with espressos. 

The past month I've been haphazardly trying to learn how to make a good espresso (to my taste) while cross referencing cafes I've visited as I learn. I say haphazard since every morning is a rush and I'm doing everything fast just to make it on time to my back to back meetings.

Anyways, I've been struggling with getting a good milk foam. It's often too much foam and ends up looking like a cappuccino in a diner that only serves Folgers. The bubbles... the bubbles... Today however... I finally got a good milk foam (at least vs my past attempts). I wasn't even expecting to do latte art but I ended up just doodling on the cup to try. 

Here's what I got. It ain't much but its an improvement to me.

Taste wise, here are the personal milestones I've crossed:

* Make an espresso better than Starbucks (low bar)
* Make an espresso milk drink better than Starbucks  (low bar)
* Make an espresso better than a cafe I like (9 bar)
* Make an espresso milk drink better than a cafe I like (9 bar)

Next up: Make GOOD latte art.",11,1763044341.0,espresso,3,0.93,False

1ow2kyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1ow2kyf/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

My husband has a pension, which will be 50% of his salary when retiring so if he ends up at a yearly salary of 100K (he will probably be higher than that), he will get 50K per year until death. I did not include this in our net worth.

Equity: Our house is assessed at $160,000.00 (maybe more at this rate - houses in our neighborhood are going for $150,000 or more right now with less updates as we have inside) when we purchased it in 2018 for $100,000. We put a down payment of $5,000 and currently owe $78,600.00 on the house. Our monthly payment is $750.00 but we pay $850.00 a month split down the middle ($425.00 each). We have a 3 Bedroom, 1.5 Bathroom house with a spacious backyard - which sadly we are outgrowing.

Checking Account: $900.00 in my Personal Checking and $1,500.00 in our Joint Checking.

My Husband has $20,000.00 in his Personal Checking.

Credit Card Debt: I pay off my other credit cards in full each month. I have 4 different cards (2 for miles and hotel points then I have 2 with Bank of America with cash back (I utilize those for work for 3% cash back on gas).

Student Loan Debt: $0.00. I paid $40,000.00 in loans off completely in 2021. $0.00 for my husband as he completed the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness.

Car Loan: $12,871.00 - Monthly Payment is $466.19 over 61 months at 5% Interest. I get reimbursed a portion of the monthly payment through work, so I am not in a rush to pay off. My husband leases his car.

Our net worth is over $600,000.00 excluding cars as husband has a lease and for what I drive for work since I put so many miles on my car.

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:**  
I graduated college in 2011 with a Bachelors in Marketing/International Business. I did not have a full time job offer post college so I worked as a hostess and bank teller while trying to find a full time job. I do und a job as a Marketing Manager making $30K commuting an hour away - stayed there 3 Months and found a job as a Sales Assistant commuting 30 minutes away. I stayed there for about 2 Years and was given an opportunity with my current employer doing inside sales. I made $35K Base plus Commission which averaged out to $60K-65K annually. I then was promoted to an outside account manager 4 years ago with a $45K Base plus Commission which averaged to $98K for Year 1 and progressed since (between $120K to $150K (complete outlier year)). I received a huge raise to my base salary of $68K in July 2021.

I accepted a new position with my company in April 2022. My base salary is $88,437.00 plus a projected $47,000.00 in commission. It could be more or less.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**  
I am paid a base salary plus quarterly commission. I would say my take home is $4,040.00 a month after Taxes, 401K, Life Insurance and ESPP. A commission check will occur every month after quarter end - this will be projected to be $7,000.00-8,500.00 take home. I receive reimbursement for mileage and car, which averages about $450.00 (typically more) a month. I also get reimbursement for tolls.

My life insurance policy is worth $600K. My husband has his multiple policies towards the $1M total value.

We don’t fully combine our finances (after over 3 years of marriage lol). We contribute to a joint account - which covers the mortgage, utilities, groceries and diapers, wipes and daycare for the baby. It’s all the same money at the end of the day but we are both stubborn and not wanting to switch banks and for purposes of this money diary, I am not tracking spending from his personal account.

**Total Take Home per Month:**  
$4040.00 for me plus vehicle reimbursement, it is around $430.00 to $800.00 a month depending on how much I drive. I will have quarterly commission as well. I do not know much my husband’s exact take home as he can work additional shifts so it varies (normally around $4000.00 but tends to be more).

**Section Three: Expenses**

My husband and I agreed to each put $2300.00 a month in a joint account to cover our joint expenses.

Rent / Mortgage / HOA fees: $850.00 per Month (paid through joint account - used to be $425.00 for my half)  
Renters / Home Insurance: Escrow through Mortgage  
Retirement Contribution: 10% Deducted  
Savings Contribution: Varies. I tend to contribute more with my commission checks. I try to save $10,000.00 a year - my goal for 2025 is to save more. I feel like we slacked a little in 2024 with saving.  
Investment Contribution for ESPP: 3% Deducted  
Investment Account: $400.00 or so - I try to save at least $5,500.00 or more a year.  
Electric: Average $80.00 (paid through joint account)  
Water: $220.00 (paid through joint account)  
Gas: $30.00 during Summer - can be close to $300.00 during Winter (it has been around $200.00 during the so far (paid through joint account))  
Wifi/Cable/Cellphone: $300.00 (paid through joint account)  
Car Payment: $466.16  
Husband’s Lease: $475.00 (husband pays through his personal account)  
Daycare: $1560.00 (paid through our joint account - less pending sick days and if we go on vacation)

529: $150.00 (paid through our joint account). We contribute an additional $2000.00 on a yearly basis. Based on my calculations if we contribute $4000.00 a year, this would cover 2-3 years of college depending on the school. With other monatary gifts throughout the year, we are pushing to $5000-6000 annually.

\*\*MD Questions\*\*

\*\*Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?\*\*  
Yes, I am the oldest so I felt the pressure to attend and succeed in college as my parents both went. My parents paid for 3 years and the last year of college was student loans. I did receive some scholarships during college.

\*\*Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?\*\*  
No. My parents provided us with whatever was needed and we had annual family vacations, majority of my college was paid for by them. I am extremely lucky and blessed. If I wanted something extra, I was able to babysit or do chores. I eventually got a part time job because my friends worked there. It was only in mid 20s, I looked into my spending/paying off debt and being “financially independent” minus the phone plan. I moved out on my own at 27. I have really focused on savings and spending the past few years. Prior to moving out at 27, I had $16K in savings.

My husband grew up the polar opposite. His parents made $60K combined. They didn’t have “new” things or family vacations. He worked to provide himself the life he always dreamed of.

\*\*What was your first job and why did you get it?\*\* Yes, I babysat for many years for my neighbors making around $10.00 an hour. My first “real” job was working at Chuck E Cheese at 17 making minimum wage. I believe it was like $7.15 back then.

\*\*Did you worry about money growing up?\*\*  
No, I am extremely lucky and blessed my parents provided my siblings and I with what we had. I did choose to get a part time job in as I like to shop/go out with my friends.

\*\*At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?\*\* 27. My safety net would be my husband and our savings - if I were to lose my job, we could survive on his income in our current living situation while I looked for other opportunities. Odds of him losing his job are quite low. Worst case my parents would help.

\*\*Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?\*\*  
Yes, passive income through my parents (college - 3ish years were covered) and $20,000.00 towards our wedding as well as $4,000.00 in savings bonds used to help pay off my student loans. I would also say my parents contribute a lot towards the boys - around $1000.00 a year for their 529s and my mom buys basically buys their wardrobe. They also rent a beach house for us for a week during the summer. We often pick up the tab for meals with them (my goal is for us to build a house that they could move into as well so they can be with family as they get older) but I am so appreciative of their support and all they do.

Day 1 - Tuesday

5:00 - both boys are up way to early. Toddler F will not go back down til a later time. Head downstairs with him and my husband goes to bed before handing off some milk to Baby M (1.5 years). Watch some TV and have an oat milk latte.

6:00 - M is up so I make my protein latte with a decaf pod and we hang out until it’s time to get ready for daycare. Dance with the disco light while getting dressed. Run around getting shoes and buckled in. F locks the door on our way out using the key pad. I am impressed and alarmed that a fresh 3 year old can do this.

7:20 - drop them off and I’m back in the house in front of my computer at 7:30. work for an hour then make breakfast (sous vide egg white bites from Sam’s and a piece of toast) and vacuum the house. Take a 1 mile walk around 9. My goal is to be over 7,000 steps per day as I am doing a 45 day challenge through my hot Pilates class.

Disclaimer! This is a very light week work-wise. I am enjoying the quiet as this is not my norm. My work is consistent but some weeks do have a lighter days.

11:00 - take another 1 mile walk. warm up my chicken for my lunch - I made Hawaiian Chicken in the crockpot on Sunday so I have that over lettuce, carrots, avocado with a miso dressing and sriracha. the chicken was OK - I feel like it was missing something.

12:00 - clean up some more by vacuuming our bedroom and dusting. make the bed. I am so light on emails today so I am a little bored with the downtime.

2:00 - run up with my husband to drop off donations at Salvation Army and make a snack plate when I get home.

3:00 - talk with my manager for 40 minutes and then pack it up around 4 to pick up the boys. Head to the park to get my last steps in for the day and the boys play for a little on the playground. We head home.

5:00 - the boys had a banana, cookies and a pouch at the park. heat up their noodles and start making dinner for myself and husband (for when he comes home later!) the boys have a ton of noodles and water while I have some zucchini, ravioli and meatballs.  play and talk to my mom on FaceTime.

6:45 - bath time and milk for the boys. F sleeps with me so we put M in the crib and lay in bed so he can watch a movie. I regret cosleeping - which is why M stays firmly put in his crib. He is 3 and has zero plans of moving into his shared room and bed again - sigh.

7:00 - body shower and do the nighttime routine - brush teeth, remove contacts and slather on some skincare.

7:15 - disco light is on in our room and so is the grinch.

8:30 - lights out and I end the day with 8,400 steps.

Day 1 Total - $0.00

Day 2 - Wednesday

4:45 - up for Pilates. I have class at 5:45 and it takes about 15 minutes to get to the studio. Class is already paid for as I buy bundles. I can typically get 10 for 100 bucks, which is a pretty good deal.

6:30 - Pilates done and over with. Get home and make a protein oat milk latte. Hear M crying as I am making the coffee and bring him downstairs. F wakes up shortly after saying “Mommy you are here!” They already had their milk while I was gone as my husband is in charge. We are trying to get them to stay in bed til after 6:30. Daylight savings rocked us.

7:30 - boys are changed and ready for daycare. Drop them off and then get home to clean up e-mails. The boys each received $125.00 for Halloween so I put them in their 529s.

9:00 - walk to get steps in while taking my conference call that I just listen in (I try to do this when I can since it is exhausting sitting at a desk all day) and of course my camera turns on in my pocket. die of embarrassment as 2 people noticed and I didn’t notice until I pulled my phone out of my pocket!

10:30 - book boys Santa pictures with a $5.00 deposit.

12:00 - leftover Hawaiian chicken again. Take another 1 mile walk. Shower then do some head down work until about 3:30.

4:00 - pick up boys then go to the park. Get home. Make F scrambled eggs, and M has mac and cheese. Get started on dinner for myself and my husband for later. We are having steaks with sweet potatoes and sautéed mushrooms and zucchini.

6:00 - eat my dinner and plop down in the living room with the boys. They are watching Mickey Mouse and have the disco light on again.

7:00 - M is in bed. F is changed and watching Beetlejuice again. I get ready for bed and lay down with F. Lights out by 8:30.

5:30 - F stomps downstairs. Change to Toy Story 3 to appease him since he doesn’t like Sesame Street (in fact he does but will fight to the death saying he doesn’t!)

6:30 - just a cluster fuck of trying to ready and the boys ready and crying.

7:20 - boys at daycare and off to my customer meeting.

8:00 - get gas for $40.27 and sausage burrito and iced coffee from McDonalds for $4.06.

3:00 - take a nice 3 mile walk since I was at like 600 steps for the day.

3:45 - put out one fire to wrap up for the day.

4:00 - husband is off so he grabs the boys and we hang out downstairs.

5:00 - pick up to square trays of pizza. husband pays again so this is also free! pizza in northeast pa is different than what I am used growing up in NJ - so I tolerate this but miss pizza from there.

7:00 - husband puts M to bed. I get F ready then myself. F wants to watch wheedle-uice (Beetlejuice). Took a few minutes to figure out what that was!

8:30 - lights out!

Day 3 Total: $44.33

Day 4 - Friday

4:00 - M is up so I give him his bottle and let him lay back down. I can’t sleep and have to be up in 50 minutes for pilates so I just scroll on my phone. M is fighting sleep hard and takes a while to go back down. It’s too early little man!

5:15 - Pilates class and leg day.

6:45 - home and made my protein latte. answer and send some emails, get the boys ready for day care. F wanted his left over chicken nuggets - sure no problem. I don’t have the energy to fight food battles in the AM. M sneaks a nugget too.

12:00 - lunch is leftover grilled chicken, peas and a sweet potato with some hot sauce and ketchup to dip the chicken in. Drink a Diet Coke because who needs water? (I do.)

1:30 - Fridays really are light days so I take a walk and text with some friends. My husband is packing as he leaves for a work training for a few weeks so I will be solo parenting!

2:00 - walk and then take a quick bath to relax.

4:00 - bathe boys and get ready for dinner.

5:30 - out to dinner. Have a ginger pear martini and my husband has a blue moon. The boys have buttered penne and bread.

It’ll be a few weeks of just me and the babies.

2:30 - get F to finally nap. Fold laundry, put away laundry, clean the bathrooms and start another load of laundry. enjoy the few minutes of quiet I will get until one wakes up.

1ow2ewi,https://i.redd.it/gqb35wxpa11g1.jpeg,"While Starbucks Workers on Strike, Do Not Buy Starbucks","SUPPORT OUR FIGHT. SKIP STARBUCKS WHILE WE STRIKE! ✊

As of today, Starbucks workers across the country are officially ON STRIKE. And we're prepared for this to become the biggest and longest strike in Starbucks history.

It has been nearly a year since Starbucks has offered us a single proposal to finish the remainder of our union contracts. The company knows where we stand: we need fair wages, better scheduling, and an end to union-busting. Instead, Starbucks is fighting US, their workers. That is why union baristas voted 92% to authorize this open-ended strike.

Until we resolve our untair labor practice (ULP) strike, workers are asking allies to skip ALL Starbucks purchases!

Want to support our union?

• Sign the No Contract No Coffee pledge and commit to not crossing a picket line! We will also send you local calls to action and picket information for your area: nocontractnocoffee.org
• Follow our socials and share our posts so everyone knows to NOT BUY STARBUCKS!

I was wondering how deep people's extensions usually are. I've been comfortable building the core of the extension itself. But I feel a mental block adding the whole shebang - user accounts, backend (if you need the data from the user). I don't talk about payments yet, just Buy me a coffee maybe.

If you’re a woman attending SC25 in St. Louis this year, I’d love to help create a little space for us to find each other.

There’s no official meetup (yet!), but I made a simple Luma page where you can mark yourself as attending so it’s easy to see who else will be there and connect before or during the conference.

📍 What this is:
A casual way for women in HPC/AI/supercomputing to connect; whether you want to grab coffee, meet during breaks, or just know a few friendly faces before the week starts.

🔗 Here’s the link:

Feel free to join, share, or tag anyone else who’s heading to SC25.

And life got real bad, real fast.

So I made this.

Not as revenge.
Not for clout.
Just because I needed something real
when the world kept calling me too much.

The Safe Man Path is half practice:
red flags, slow fades, gut-checks.

And half story:
an immersive, choose-your-own scenario
