I'm 19, she's 19, and we both live in the same city. This whole thing started in the most random way possible - I commented something pretty harsh and negative on her confession post, and it somehow got many upvotes. She DM'd me saying I didn't need to be so mean and judgmental and that we're all human and stuff. That's how we started chatting, and honestly, we did vibe.

After about two weeks of messaging on Reddit, we moved to Snapchat and eventually followed each other on Instagram. We don't chat every single day now, but when we do talk, it's for hours. We've discussed everything - regular life stuff, deep conversations, and yeah, intimate and romantic topics too. We're pretty open with each other about our opinions and experiences.

Here's what I need to be honest about - she's really hot, sweet, and I'm definitely attracted to her. From our conversations, I know she's currently in an FWB situation, and we've talked pretty openly about intimate stuff and what we're into. The thing is, I'm a virgin and she's not. We're like 90% sure we're meeting next week, and I'm honestly nervous as hell about it.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to handle this. What should I keep in mind? what should i do to not make it awkward? Anyone been in a similar situation? Would really appreciate any help here. ( we will just be meeting for coffee, the plan now is that we will meet at a cafe, hangout, and i will drop her . )

I’m a 24-year-old male from Pune. Back when I was in 11th standard, in my hometown, I used to like a girl. The moment I saw her, I literally fell in love. We used to talk and chat normally, but she mostly gave one-word replies. Because of that, I thought maybe she wasn’t interested, and I eventually stopped talking to her, especially since I personally hate short and late replies.

Later, I realized that she was a very introverted person and had very few friends. So I couldn’t really figure out the reason for her behavior, whether she didn’t like me or if she was just introverted. I didn’t try much from my end, and that chapter ended there.

After my 12th, I moved to Pune for graduation and got a job through campus placement.

Cut to five years later. I was traveling to my hometown and had just gotten down, waiting for my brother to pick me up. Out of nowhere, a girl came up to me and asked, “Hey, do you remember me? How are you?” I couldn’t recognize her because her face was wrapped in a stole. I said, “Sorry, I can’t recognize you.” Then she told me her name, and it was her.

I was absolutely shocked and stood there like a statue for a few seconds. My whole body was shivering. Then we talked for a few minutes while standing there. It turns out she’s also working in Pune. I suggested that we should meet sometime for coffee, and she agreed.

Then my brother arrived, and I left.

When I got home, she herself DMed me, and we chatted for a long time. She said she felt really good meeting me after such a long time, and I felt the same.

After a month, when I was back in the city, I thought I should ask her out. I started texting her normally, asking about her day, her job, and general things. But she started giving short and late replies again, unlike when she had DMed me earlier. That really frustrated me.

So one fine day, I confessed my feelings to her. She took it very positively and didn’t get mad, but she also said that she doesn’t feel the same way about me.

And that was my answer.

Eventually, I stopped texting her.

But now, one part of my brain says that I should at least ask her out for coffee. I just want to meet her once. The other part says that she has already given me a clear answer, and nothing will change that, so I should stop trying.

I really want to meet her just once I don't have any expectations after that, but I don’t want her to think that I’m a creep, like I’m still asking her out even after she said no.

Like… the way everybody acts like he can do no wrong. The way his mood decides the whole day. The way one small sentence from him changes people’s behavior like a switch.

It’s crazy.

If he comes in smiling, suddenly the office is alive. People laughing. People talking. Even the coffee tastes better. If he comes in quiet or annoyed, the whole place gets cold. Everybody typing extra loud like it proves something. Nobody jokes. Nobody breathes too hard. It’s like we all become background characters.

And the funny part is nobody admits it. Everyone acts normal. But you can see it. People watch him like he’s the weather report. Like, do we get sunshine today or do we get storm. Because if it’s storm, you better stay out the way.

He’ll say one thing and it becomes law. Doesn’t matter if it makes sense. Doesn’t matter if it’s fair. If he says “we need this by today,” people will move mountains. If somebody else says it, it’s a discussion. With him, it’s automatic panic.

Sometimes I look around and think… why are we like this. Then I remember. Paychecks. Bills. Rent. Life. We act brave online and then a manager clears his throat and we sit up straight like we’re in school again.

I’m not even saying he’s a bad person. Some bosses are cool. Some are actually trying. But the power is still weird. Like no matter how grown you are, a boss can still make you feel small. You can be 30 years old and still get nervous when they say “can you come to my office?” That sentence alone can ruin your whole lunch.

And don’t get me started on the boss jokes. Everyone got two personalities. One personality is normal human. The other personality is “yes sir, absolutely sir, great point sir.” People be switching voices like it’s a customer service call.

The only time my boss feels like a normal person is when he laughs at something stupid. Then I’m like okay, he’s human. For two minutes. Then he goes back to boss mode and everyone goes back to acting like he’s the main character.

So yeah, my boss is a god. Not because he’s perfect. But because everybody treats him like his mood is the law of nature.

Men, on the other hand… men gossip like it’s a bad weather report. “Bro, did you see Sumit yesterday?” “Yeah.” “What about him?” “I dunno.”

Men gossip is literally: Who? What? Meh. End of story. That’s it. And somehow, we’re supposed to be social creatures

If a man gossips, it’s… a memo. A very boring memo.

Men think we’re “above gossip.”
We act like we don’t care.
Meanwhile, we’re sitting there listening to a story about someone’s new haircut for twenty minutes and nodding like it’s War and Peace.

Women?

But the real cheat code? Learning what to add to your plate. The truth is, your body has built-in systems that fight fat, kill cancer cells, and regenerate tissue, but they only work if you fuel them right.

Dr. William Li, author of ""Eat To Beat Disease"", breaks down how specific foods literally activate your body’s defense systems. After digging into his research, plus studies across nutrition science and metabolic health, this is your no-BS guide to eating smarter starting today. 



**1. Eat more high-fiber, polyphenol-rich foods like berries, tea, and dark chocolate.**  

Dr. Li explains that your gut microbiome plays a massive role in weight regulation and immunity. In a 2021 study from ""Nature"", researchers found that polyphenols from foods like blueberries and green tea not only improve gut health but also reduce visceral fat, the dangerous kind wrapped around your organs. 



**2. Focus on angiogenesis-regulating foods** (they “starve” fat).

This sounds wild, but it’s actually a core principle from Dr. Li’s work. Angiogenesis is how blood vessels grow. Fat tissue needs a blood supply to expand. Certain foods, like tomatoes, soy, and even coffee, help cut off that supply, essentially choking fat cells. A 2010 study published in ""Cell"" found that controlling angiogenesis triggers fat loss independent of calorie restriction. 



**3. Fermented foods are underrated AF.**

A Stanford University study in 2021 demonstrated that eating fermented foods like kimchi, kefir, and sauerkraut increases microbiome diversity and reduces inflammation across the board. This leads to improved metabolism, reduced fat gain, and even better mood regulation. Most people think of probiotics as supplements, but food-based fermented sources are often more powerful. 



**4. Add more seafood** (especially fatty fish and seaweed).

Omega-3s aren’t just good for your heart. They improve insulin sensitivity and reduce chronic inflammation, both key drivers of fat storage. A 2015 meta-analysis in ""The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition"" revealed that consistent omega-3 intake leads to modest but significant fat loss, especially around the waist. Seaweed also contains iodine and fucoxanthin, which may boost metabolism naturally. 



**5. Mushrooms. Yes, seriously.**  

They’re low-cal, nutrient-dense, and packed with compounds that support the immune system. According to research from Penn State, mushrooms contain unique antioxidants that protect against cellular damage and may lower the risk of cancer. Dr. Li also highlights that some mushrooms have anti-angiogenic properties, aka they help block new blood vessels from feeding fat cells.

This post pulls from some of the best sources out there, Li’s book, academic studies, and lectures from Harvard’s Metabolic Health Symposium. The goal here isn’t a quick fix. It’s about eating in a way that aligns with how your biology actually works.

I am beyond grateful to have booked **Cairo Manta and his team** as my wedding hair and makeup artist. Our first HMUA booked double booked me (I have screenshots for proof) My peg was subtle and not too heavy make up. So I stalked Cairo sa wawies and instagram then immediately booked him. From the very beginning, he was professional, responsive, and easy to talk to, which already gave me peace of mind during the stressful wedding preparations. On the wedding day itself, everything went smoothly. He arrived on time (earliest siya sa lahat ng suppliers btw) and worked efficiently. The makeup was not heavy at all, very natural and elegant, and it lasted the whole day despite the emotions (I cried a lot that day as iyakin), heat (garden wedding kami), and long program. I received so many compliments from family and friends. If you’re looking for an HMUA who is talented and professional. I **highly recommend Cairo Manta**.

  
**Band and Singer:** Acoustinary Wedding Musicians - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Highly Recommended**

One important thing we looked for in our wedding band was the ability to play Christian songs for the Bridal Walk—and they truly delivered. The music during that moment was meaningful and beautifully done. They arrived on time and came fully prepared with their instruments and sound system. The setup was smooth, and there were no technical issues throughout the program. They followed the agreed program flow very well and knew exactly when to play for each part of the event. Overall, the wedding band helped create a lively and memorable atmosphere during our reception. If you’re looking for live music that can both honor meaningful moments and keep the celebration alive, they are definitely worth considering.



**Wedding Gown:** Pronovias - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **Recommended**

I’ve always wanted a ready-to-wear (RTW) wedding gown, especially after seeing friends regret going custom. I visited a lot of wedding gown suppliers—from Divi to branded stores—because I can be a bit picky. Hehe. Then I stumbled upon Pronovias PH by Mi Sueno Bridal. I tried on several gowns there, and finally, I found **the one**! The RTW gowns are beautiful, and the team made the whole experience enjoyable and stress-free. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that a few alterations were needed to get the perfect fit, and the location was a bit far from QC. But the team was supportive, patient, and guided me throughout the process, which I really appreciated.



**Wedding Host:** Stephen Tierra - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Highly Recommended**

We were so lucky to have Stephen as our wedding emcee! From start to finish, he was professional, engaging, and full of energy, keeping our guests entertained and the program flowing smoothly AND PLUS POINTS our guests said ang pogi daw hahaha! Kidding aside, what I appreciated most was how he adapted to last-minute changes and still kept everything fun and organized. Their warm and friendly presence made everyone feel comfortable, and he really added a personal touch that made our wedding extra special.



**Grazing Table:** Lulubon - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Highly Recommended**

Eto yung isa sa mga suppliers na sinabi ng guests namin na SUPER sarap ng grazing table niyo. Everything was fresh and delicious. The cheeses and charcuterie were well-selected and paired thoughtfully with accompaniments. The fruits were ripe and flavorful, and the baked goods were light and tasty. Even our guests with more particular tastes were impressed with the variety and quality, cause we had very picky guests. Hehe. Our guests kept complimenting the grazing table, and it became a focal point of the reception. It not only provided a delicious snack option but also served as a visual centerpiece that matched our garden wedding aesthetic perfectly.



**Mobile Bar:** Tara Barik Mobile Bar - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Recommended**

Our experience with Tara Barik was fantastic! The mobile bar setup was stylish, functional, and fit perfectly with our venue. The team was professional, punctual, and very friendly, making sure every guest was served promptly. We loved their **Mojitos**, and so did our guests—they were so popular that they ran out before the four-hour unlimited cocktail period stated in our contract. Drinks were prepared quickly, so no one had to wait, which kept everyone happy. I removed one star because of the Mojito shortage, but overall, we were very pleased with their service and would highly recommend Tara Barik for any event.



**Ice Cream Cart:** Kanto Sorbetero Tagaytay - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Recommended**

The service was okay. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to enjoy the ice cream because the venue was too cold na, but the team was professional and set up everything as planned. So head up to brides getting married sa Tagaytay Area or Cavite during December. But the kids sa wedding loved them naman.

  
**Food Cart:** Potato Corner - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Highly Recommended**

This was a crowd favorite.  The fries were consistently delicious, hot, and fresh. We chose Sour Cream and Barbecue flavors. The seasoning was well-balanced, and the portions were generous, making it easy for everyone to enjoy. The team was professional and punctual, arriving on time and setting up before the reception started. They were attentive during the event, checking in to make sure everything ran smoothly. Communication beforehand was clear, and they accommodated our requests for specific flavors and portion sizes.



**Coffee Cart & Souvenirs for Guests:** Velvets Cafe - ⭐⭐ **Okay I guess ??**

We booked Velvets Cafe because of their promo—if you booked the coffee cart, you’d get a discount on souvenirs. The coffee cart was great; all the hot beverages were delicious and there were no issues. However, the **souvenirs were a bit disappointing**. They packed up early, so only about half of our guests were able to get the perfumes. The leather stamping activity was okay, and their setup looked beautiful. The quality of the souvenirs was decent, and they arrived on time, but it didn’t feel fully worth it for all our guests. Overall, they were acceptable for our event, but there’s room for improvement.



**Lechon:** ED and Daisy Lechon - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Highly Recommended**

We had to find a supplier within the area lang so I stumbled upon ED and Daisy Lechon, sila pinkaaffordable sa lahat ng nearby lechen supplier pero by 300-500 pesos compared sa iba. Sabi ng guests crispy daw and the meat was tender, flavorful, and juicy. Walang naging problem sa communication kasi nagsusupply na sila dati sa Angelfields. No hassle on our part during the wedding.

F24, ever since the divorce of my parents, death of my mom and grampa I went through a whole lot of garbage. Name it, i probably had it. Bulimia, Anorexia, compulsive disorder, ADHD.

With the history of anorexia, i pretty much wrecked my body. I'm still underweight, not as much as i used to but still. Every little effort, strain, overstimulation knocks me out.

1qjojil,https://v.redd.it/v5te2295wueg1,How to Create an AI Influencer (Step-by-Step),"Seeing lots of questions about **AI influencers** and **AI influencer generators**. Here's the exact workflow I use with the actual prompts.

I'm using [writingmate.ai](http://writingmate.ai) for this since it has both image and video models in one place, but you can use any platform with similar models.

**Step 1: Create Your AI Influencer's Base Image**

Model: Nano Banana Pro (or similar photorealistic model)

The key to consistency is using structured JSON prompts instead of freeform text. This gives you granular control over every detail:

Prompt:

    { ""scene_type"": ""Indoor lifestyle portrait"", ""environment"": { ""location"": ""Sunlit bedroom"", ""background"": { ""bed"": ""White linen bed with floral sheets"", ""decor"": ""Minimal plants and neutral decor"", ""windows"": ""Sheer-curtained window"", ""color_palette"": ""Soft whites, sage green accents"" }, ""atmosphere"": ""Quiet, cozy, intimate"" }, ""subject"": { ""gender_presentation"": ""Feminine"", ""approximate_age_group"": ""Young adult"", ""skin_tone"": ""Fair"", ""hair"": { ""color"": ""Platinum blonde"", ""style"": ""Long, straight, loose"" }, ""facial_features"": { ""expression"": ""Introspective, calm"", ""makeup"": ""Natural, barely-there"" }, ""body_details"": { ""build"": ""Slim to average"", ""visible_tattoos"": [ ""Botanical arm tattoos"", ""Small thigh tattoo"" ] } }, ""pose"": { ""position"": ""Seated on bed"", ""legs"": ""Knees drawn close to chest"", ""hands"": ""One hand holding phone, other wrapped loosely around legs"", ""orientation"": ""Front-facing mirror selfie"" }, ""clothing"": { ""outfit_type"": ""Soft sleepwear dress"", ""color"": ""Muted sage green"", ""material"": ""Breathable semi-sheer fabric"", ""details"": ""Thin straps, subtle lace edging"" }, ""styling"": { ""accessories"": [""Delicate necklace""], ""nails"": ""Natural nude"", ""overall_style"": ""Minimal, soft, feminine"" }, ""lighting"": { ""type"": ""Natural daylight"", ""source"": ""Window"", ""quality"": ""Even and diffused"", ""shadows"": ""Very soft"" }, ""mood"": { ""emotional_tone"": ""Peaceful, introspective"", ""visual_feel"": ""Calm, personal"" }, ""camera_details"": { ""camera_type"": ""Smartphone"", ""lens_equivalent"": ""26mm"", ""perspective"": ""Mirror selfie"", ""focus"": ""Clean subject clarity"", ""aperture_simulation"": ""f/1.8 look"", ""iso_simulation"": ""Low ISO"", ""white_balance"": ""Daylight neutral"" }, ""rendering_style"": { ""realism_level"": ""Ultra photorealistic"", ""detail_level"": ""Natural skin texture, realistic light falloff"", ""post_processing"": ""Soft highlights, gentle contrast"", ""artifacts"": ""None"" } }

**Step 2: Generate Content Variations**

Keep the subject block identical every time. Only change:

* scene\_type
* environment
* pose
* clothing
* lighting
* mood

Example - Coffee shop variation:

    { ""scene_type"": ""Casual cafe portrait"", ""environment"": { ""location"": ""Minimalist coffee shop"", ""background"": { ""setting"": ""Window seat with street view"", ""decor"": ""Exposed brick, wooden tables"", ""color_palette"": ""Warm browns, cream tones"" }, ""atmosphere"": ""Relaxed, morning quiet"" }, ""subject"": { ""gender_presentation"": ""Feminine"", ""approximate_age_group"": ""Young adult"", ""skin_tone"": ""Fair"", ""hair"": { ""color"": ""Platinum blonde"", ""style"": ""Long, straight, loose"" }, ""facial_features"": { ""expression"": ""Soft smile, looking at camera"", ""makeup"": ""Natural, barely-there"" }, ""body_details"": { ""build"": ""Slim to average"", ""visible_tattoos"": [ ""Botanical arm tattoos"" ] } }, ""pose"": { ""position"": ""Seated at table"", ""hands"": ""Both hands wrapped around ceramic coffee cup"", ""orientation"": ""Three-quarter angle"" }, ""clothing"": { ""outfit_type"": ""Oversized knit sweater"", ""color"": ""Cream white"", ""material"": ""Soft wool blend"" }, ""lighting"": { ""type"": ""Natural daylight"", ""source"": ""Large window to the side"", ""quality"": ""Soft, diffused morning light"" }, ""camera_details"": { ""camera_type"": ""Mirrorless"", ""lens_equivalent"": ""35mm"", ""aperture_simulation"": ""f/2.0 look"", ""perspective"": ""Eye level"" }, ""rendering_style"": { ""realism_level"": ""Ultra photorealistic"", ""post_processing"": ""Warm color grade, soft contrast"" } }

**Step 3: Create Video**

Model: Kling 2.6

This is the easy part. Upload your generated image and use a simple prompt:

Prompt: animate this

That's it. Kling handles the natural movement - blinking, subtle breathing, hair movement.

For more specific motion, you can add details: animate this, slight smile, gentle head turn to the right

animate this, brings cup to lips, takes a sip, lowers cup

Settings:

* Duration: 5-10 seconds
* Aspect ratio: 9:16 for Reels/TikTok

Why JSON Prompts Work Better

1. Consistency - Copy the subject block exactly every time
2. Granular control - Adjust specific details without rewriting everything
3. Easier variations - Swap environment/clothing blocks while keeping identity locked
4. Reproducible - Save your character's JSON as a template

**Quick Start Template**

Save this as your base character file and swap out the non-subject sections:

    { ""subject"": { // YOUR CHARACTER - NEVER CHANGE THIS }, ""environment"": { // CHANGE PER SHOT }, ""pose"": { // CHANGE PER SHOT }, ""clothing"": { // CHANGE PER SHOT } }

For a premier agency like [House of DM](https://houseofdm.com/courses.html), we have watched the landscape shift from simple keyword targeting to a complex ecosystem where visibility is earned through trust, technology, and timing. As we move through 2025, ""traditional"" SEO is being replaced by a more holistic approach: Search Everywhere Optimization.

Today’s consumers are no longer tethered to a single search box. They are discovering brands through Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE), asking complex questions to AI chatbots, and using TikTok as a visual search engine. If your brand isn't appearing in these diverse touchpoints, you are missing out on the modern customer journey.

# The Impact of AI on Search Visibility

The most significant shift this year is the integration of AI directly into search results. With the rise of Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), search engines are now aiming to provide immediate answers rather than just a list of links. This means your content strategy must evolve.

At House of DM, we emphasize the E-E-A-T framework (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness). Google’s latest Helpful Content Updates prioritize information that feels human and expert-led. To rank in an AI-driven world, your content shouldn't just repeat facts; it should provide unique insights, case studies, and real-world applications that an AI cannot replicate.

# The Shift Toward Discovery Engines

We are also seeing a massive trend where social media platforms are functioning as search engines. For younger demographics, a search for a ""Digital Marketing Agency"" or ""New York Coffee Shop"" is just as likely to happen on Instagram or TikTok as it is on Google.

This **Social SEO** trend requires a different set of tools. It involves optimizing video captions, utilizing trending audio strategically, and ensuring that visual content is tagged correctly for search algorithms. For our clients, we integrate these social signals into our broader SEO strategy, ensuring that your brand remains visible wherever your audience chooses to browse.

# Quality Over Quantity: The Topic Cluster Model

The days of ""cranking out"" 500-word blog posts for the sake of frequency are over. Search engines now reward Topic Authority. Instead of targeting scattered keywords, the most successful brands are building Topic Clusters.

This strategy involves creating a comprehensive ""Pillar Page"" that covers a broad subject in depth, supported by several ""Cluster"" articles that dive into specific sub-topics. This internal linking structure signals to search engines that you are a definitive source of information. It improves your Mobile-First Indexing scores and keeps users on your site longer, which are both critical ranking factors.

# Technical Foundations and Core Web Vitals

You can have the best content in the world, but if your website is slow or unresponsive, you will never reach the first page. Technical SEO remains the backbone of any digital marketing success story.

Google’s focus on Core Web Vitals specifically how fast a page loads and how quickly it becomes interactive is more aggressive than ever. We focus on optimizing the ""Interaction to Next Paint"" (INP) to ensure that every user experience is seamless. In an era of instant gratification, technical performance is often the tie-breaker between you and your competitors.

# Dominating the Local Economy

For businesses looking to capture immediate demand, Local SEO Services are the bridge between a search and a sale. The ""Near Me"" economy is thriving, but it requires more than just a basic profile. Today’s local search success involves managing high-quality, keyword-rich reviews, maintaining NAP Consistency (Name, Address, Phone) across the web, and creating hyper-local content that resonates with specific communities.

# The House of DM Advantage

At House of DM, we don't just follow trends we help our clients set them. SEO is no longer a standalone task; it is the thread that runs through your entire digital presence. From Voice [Search Optimization](https://houseofdm.com/courses.html) to Technical SEO Audits, our goal is to ensure your brand is the answer to the questions your customers are asking.

The future of search is conversational, visual, and AI-assisted. By staying ahead of these shifts today, we ensure your business remains the leader in your industry tomorrow.

It had not been great at all for dates, as I’m on the free version. I’m pretty, athletic build, and have my life together. Would love to find the same in a partner. I’m in a very small dating pool so it’s not easy and there’s more women than men so the guys tend to punch above - or they at least try lol.

Anyhow, didn’t have a lot of exciting matches and then this 30M replied to a prompt. He seemed relatively interested in me with lots of questions and I asked him questions too. He was not my physical type as he was heavier, bald and younger, but we seemed to have similar activity interests/values so I figured I’d keep chatting. After a week I wasn’t really feeling attracted or any chemistry with him, and should have told him, but felt bad to not see it through (lesson learned). He asked me out, and I gave him a few different nights I would be free. He then suggested a Tuesday at 11 am, which was so random. I have a flexible schedule so I stupidly made it work. The date was friendly and we chatted a lot about our interests. He then asked for my number afterwards. I messaged him and thanked him for coffee and he wrote: “I don’t think we should go on another date as we have zero chemistry and I don’t feel a romantic attraction, hope you understand”…I honestly laughed at work, because I felt like he went through so much trouble to put this “date” together just to be able to say this to me. I said that okay and I asked him if this had to do with him being interested in someone else, or if it was something I did for feedback. He said it was the former.

It takes a really unhinged person to set up a rejection date when they are clearly pining for someone unattainable just for a hit of validation. Ultimately, I’m mad at myself, as I didn’t want to go on the date in the first place, was way too accommodating with the ridiculous date time, I wasn’t remotely attracted to him, but I have an aversion to hurting peoples feelings.

# Chapter 1

I had just pulled the teddy bear cookies from the oven when my daughter Dora ran into the kitchen.

“Dora, sweetheart! Mommy’s special cookies are ready!”

But the moment she saw the cookies, her face went white as a sheet. She screamed “Get away! Get away!” and bolted from the room.

I was completely stunned. Just then, my husband Herbert walked through the door.

“Try one and tell me what’s wrong,” I said, pointing at the cookies.

Herbert was about to comfort me, but when he learned I’d made these cookies for Dora, his expression turned absolutely bizarre. “You really made these? If you did, I want a divorce. Immediately!”

“What?”

My mother-in-law Athena heard the commotion and came to console me, but the moment she heard these were cookies I’d made for my daughter, she slapped the entire tray out of my hands. “What kind of mother are you?!”

Cookie crumbs scattered across the floor. I stood there in shock, completely bewildered by what was happening.

That evening, they went out to dinner, leaving me alone at home.

I knelt on the kitchen floor, picking up cookie fragments one by one, tears streaming down my face. The cookies looked perfectly normal—golden brown, adorable teddy bear shapes, giving off that tempting buttery aroma.

What could possibly be wrong? Why would even my beloved daughter run from me?

I carefully packed the few remaining intact cookies into a box, feeling both angry and hurt. I was going insane. Was something wrong with me, or was something wrong with this world?

I decided to visit my best friend Karlie. She’d help me figure this out.

Walking down the street, I opened the box to check if the cookies had gotten damaged. But passersby immediately recoiled like they’d seen a ghost. One woman pushing a stroller even called me a “freak.”

My heart raced. I quickly shut the box and practically ran toward Karlie’s coffee shop.

“Jacey?” Karlie saw my panicked state and immediately approached. “God, what happened? You look terrible.”

I broke down crying. “Herbert and my mother-in-law have lost their minds, and even my daughter…”

“They were really that harsh? They turned on you just because of cookies?” Karlie’s voice sounded incredulous.

I was angry and hurt, tears flowing freely. “Yes! And I asked so many people—they all said the cookies looked fine at first. But the moment they heard I made them for my daughter, everything changed.”

“I’m losing my mind. Either something’s wrong with me, or something’s wrong with this world.”

Karlie quickly reassured me. “Don’t worry, let me see what’s going on.”

I opened the box with trembling hands.

Karlie examined them carefully, even leaning in to smell them. “I’ve looked at everything—there’s absolutely nothing wrong! They’re just regular teddy bear cookies.”

Hearing her words, I finally felt some relief. “Exactly! I’ve been baking for years. How could I possibly mess up…”

My complaints trailed off as I noticed Karlie had suddenly frozen.

“These cookies… you really made them for your daughter?”

Hearing those words, my blood ran cold.

Because everyone’s attitude changed completely after asking that exact question.

Karlie’s smile vanished entirely. She threw a dish towel at my face. “I never imagined you were this kind of person! Bringing this disgusting stuff into my shop? Get out!”

Her eyes filled with revulsion and fear. “I wish I’d never met you!”

“How could there be someone like you, a monster who would do this to her own daughter! Get out! Get out right now!”

I was stunned. The person who’d been comforting me moments ago was now cursing me with the most vicious words.

“Karlie, I don’t understand…”

“Get out! Don’t let me see you again!” She pointed at the door, her voice shaking.

I stumbled out of the coffee shop, wandering the streets like a zombie. Everyone’s words echoed in my head—”freak,” “monster,” “disgusting”…

What had I done? Why were even my closest people treating me this way?

Late that night, I returned home to find the living room packed with suitcases. Herbert, Athena, and Dora were packing to leave.

Seeing this scene, my world completely collapsed. I rushed over and grabbed Herbert’s arm. “Where are you going?”

He shook off my hand like I was the plague.

I reached for my daughter, but Dora hid behind Athena, too scared to even look at me.

In desperation, I dropped to my knees. “Please, just tell me what’s wrong? Why are you all leaving because of cookies?”

The three of them looked down at me coldly. No one would respond.

“I’m your wife, your mother! Even if I did something wrong, at least tell me what it was!” I cried out in anguish.

Herbert finally spoke. He looked down at me kneeling on the floor, his voice filled with anger and disgust. “You brought that sick stuff into our home? Don’t you have any shame?”

“They’re just cookies…”

SLAP! A hand struck my face.

Herbert looked at me like I was the most revolting thing in the world. “Are you really that clueless, or have you been pretending all along?”

“I think you’re rotten to the core. Even animals don’t harm their own young.”

# Chapter 1

I had just pulled the teddy bear cookies from the oven when my daughter Dora ran into the kitchen.

“Dora, sweetheart! Mommy’s special cookies are ready!”

But the moment she saw the cookies, her face went white as a sheet. She screamed “Get away! Get away!” and bolted from the room.

I was completely stunned. Just then, my husband Herbert walked through the door.

“Try one and tell me what’s wrong,” I said, pointing at the cookies.

Herbert was about to comfort me, but when he learned I’d made these cookies for Dora, his expression turned absolutely bizarre. “You really made these? If you did, I want a divorce. Immediately!”

“What?”

My mother-in-law Athena heard the commotion and came to console me, but the moment she heard these were cookies I’d made for my daughter, she slapped the entire tray out of my hands. “What kind of mother are you?!”

Cookie crumbs scattered across the floor. I stood there in shock, completely bewildered by what was happening.

That evening, they went out to dinner, leaving me alone at home.

I knelt on the kitchen floor, picking up cookie fragments one by one, tears streaming down my face. The cookies looked perfectly normal—golden brown, adorable teddy bear shapes, giving off that tempting buttery aroma.

What could possibly be wrong? Why would even my beloved daughter run from me?

I carefully packed the few remaining intact cookies into a box, feeling both angry and hurt. I was going insane. Was something wrong with me, or was something wrong with this world?

I decided to visit my best friend Karlie. She’d help me figure this out.

Walking down the street, I opened the box to check if the cookies had gotten damaged. But passersby immediately recoiled like they’d seen a ghost. One woman pushing a stroller even called me a “freak.”

My heart raced. I quickly shut the box and practically ran toward Karlie’s coffee shop.

1qjo17o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HardSciFiSerials/comments/1qjo17o/the_healer/,The Healer,"I watch her breathe. The rise and fall of her chest is a fragile flutter beneath the starched white sheet, a pathetic counter-rhythm to the steady, indifferent beep of the monitor beside her bed. This room, sanitized of all life and scent, is our final chapter. They call her Elara, a name on a chart, but I see the ghost of the woman whose hands smelled of chamomile and rain-soaked moss, whose laughter could coax a bloom from the most stubborn soil. Her skin, once warmed by the sun as she tended our garden, is now translucent, a roadmap of blue veins against the stark white of the pillow. Her life's work was to mend, to soothe, to heal, and now this sterile box is siphoning away the last of her light, little by little. I see all our years of love and happiness flickering out in her vacant gaze, and I can do nothing but watch.

The guilt is a physical thing, a stone in my gut. I, who she healed a hundred times over with a touch or a word, stand useless now. I trace the lines of our life together in my mind, searching for the moment I failed her, the sign I must have missed. Was it the weariness in her eyes I dismissed as just a long day? The slight tremble in her hand I told myself was just the cold? I brought her all my broken pieces, and she mended me without a second thought, her love a constant, gentle poultice. But when the sickness began to take root in her, silent and insidious, I was blind. I let her pour all her magic into others, into me, until there was nothing left for herself. This slow, agonizing fade is my doing. I am the architect of this quiet, antiseptic hell, and I am condemned to watch her disappear within its walls.

The funeral is a blur of black suits and sympathetic murmurs that don’t reach me. I stand among people who loved her, our friends, her family, yet I am utterly alone, adrift in the ocean of my own mind. Their faces are indistinct masks of sorrow, their words a meaningless drone against the roaring silence in my head. They pat my shoulder and offer condolences that sound like a foreign language. I nod and mumble my thanks, but I am not there. I am back in that sterile room, watching her breathe her last, or further back, in our garden, the sun on her face as she laughed. Each memory is a phantom limb, an ache for what has been amputated from my soul.

Then comes the cruelest act: returning to our house. The silence here is different; it’s a living entity, heavy and suffocating with her absence. Everything is a relic, a testament to a life abruptly halted. Her scent, a faint trace of lavender and earth, clings to the pillows on our bed. A book lies face down on the nightstand, the page marked where she stopped reading. The house, once our shared sanctuary, is now a museum of my failure. Every object screams her name, a chorus of accusations I can’t escape. I walk through these rooms, a ghost in my own home, haunted by the life we built and the one I let slip away.

The thought takes root in the barren soil of my grief: I should have found a way. The conviction is absolute, a desperate prayer against the finality of her absence. If not for her, then for others. I cannot let this happen again. So, my search begins. The world outside my windows ceases to exist. My life shrinks to the cold glow of a screen, a portal to a universe of forgotten knowledge. I descend into digital catacombs, chasing whispers of ancient remedies and esoteric cures. I fall through rabbit holes of fringe science, alchemy, and forgotten folklore, my days and nights bleeding into a single, continuous hunt. With each click, I sift through the accumulated dust of human history—digitized scrolls, medical texts deemed heretical, the journals of mystics and madmen. Somewhere in this endless ocean of information, a single drop of hope must exist. I know it. I have to believe it.

This obsession needs fuel, a pyre on which I can burn my old life. The house, our beautiful, haunted house, is the only answer. I sell it. The transaction is a cold, bloodless affair that turns sacred memories into currency. The money feels dirty, but necessary. It is the price of my pilgrimage. I meet with family, with the few friends who still try to breach my walls of isolation. Their faces are etched with concern. They speak of grief counseling, of time, of moving on. I try to explain that this is my way of moving on, not from her, but with her. I tell them I cannot stay here, suffocated by the ghost of a happiness I can no longer touch. They don't understand. In their eyes, I see they think I've lost my mind. Perhaps I have. But this madness has a purpose. It's the only thing that does. And so I leave, trading the familiar ache of our home for the unknown promise of the horizon, a man running not from a memory, but towards an impossible cure.

My pilgrimage becomes a frantic chase across continents. I haunt the hallowed halls of the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, my fingers tracing the spines of forgotten grimoires until the vellum feels like dust. In New York, I lose myself in the digital glow of medical archives, the clinical language of failed trials a cold echo of my own helplessness. I walk the crowded streets of Beijing, seeking out traditional masters whose wisdom is lost in translation, their promises turning to smoke in my hands. I stand before the grotto in Lourdes, a silent observer in a sea of fervent prayer, feeling nothing but the chill of the stone. I climb towards the thin air of the Himalayas, my body screaming in protest, hoping for a revelation in the silence of the peaks, only to find my own emptiness reflected in the vast, indifferent sky. Every whispered legend, every miracle cure, becomes a dead end. The roads are many, but they all lead to the same crushing impasse.

Then, after the years have bled together into a gray blur, I find it. Not in an ancient text or a hidden archive, but in the most mundane of places: a discarded newspaper on a rain-streaked café table in Amsterdam. My eyes scan the pages out of habit, another catalog of human misery. A full-page spread details the horrors of the war in Sudan—brutal, familiar descriptions of suffering. But my gaze snags on a small, grainy photograph at the bottom of the page. A man with dark skin and a weary beard stands before a makeshift clinic. The caption is brief: ""Dr. Skrimar Harimaar, an island of hope."" It isn't hope I see in his eyes, not that simple word. It is a profound, soul-deep weariness that mirrors my own. He has stared into the same abyss. Yet, where my gaze found only darkness, his holds a light that has refused to be extinguished. In that moment, the world rushes back in. The scent of coffee, the drumming of the rain, the murmur of distant conversations. A current jols through me, the first true feeling that isn’t grief. I tear the photograph from the page, my hands shaking. I have to find this man. I have to look into those eyes and understand.

Getting into a war-torn country is a descent. The rules of the world I knew peel away with each checkpoint, replaced by the raw currency of desperation and suspicion. I was a seasoned traveler, but this was not travel; it was an infiltration. Bribes were not polite exchanges but tense negotiations under the barrels of guns. My determination was a cold, hard knot in my stomach, the only thing that didn't waver in the shimmering heat and the paranoid glances of armed men. After weeks that felt like years, I found it: a temple of weathered stone, half-swallowed by the encroaching desert, in a corner of the country so ravaged that it felt like the world's last, forgotten wound.

He was there. Skrimar. Tall, yes, but the photo hadn't captured the stillness about him, an anchor of calm in a sea of chaos. His eyes, when they met mine, were not merely kind. They were ancient. They saw the years of frantic searching, the ghost of Elara I carried on my back, the raw, selfish desperation that fueled my quest. He didn't ask why I was there. He simply nodded, and in that gesture, I felt seen. He took me on as a helper. My days became a ritual of tending to the broken and the sick who gathered at the temple gates. I organized the lines, doled out water, and learned to speak a language of gestures and tone, a shared humanity that needed no translation.

Each day, he would take a few inside the temple's cool, dark interior. I never saw what happened. I only saw the result. They would emerge hours later, blinking in the harsh sunlight. A man with a leg twisted and festering would walk out straight, his steps hesitant not from pain, but from sheer disbelief. A woman whose face was a mask of weeping sores would emerge with skin unblemished, her hands tracing her own cheeks in wonder. In their eyes, I saw it. Not just a cure. It was a remaking. A reversal of the irreversible. Everything I had been told was impossible was happening right in front of me, and the sight of it was both terrifying and holy.

For weeks, I see him only in the evenings. He emerges from the temple's inner sanctum not triumphant, but hollowed out, as if the miracles he performs are carved directly from his own being. The weight of the suffering he absorbs is a visible thing, a stoop in his shoulders, a tremor in his hand as he raises a cup of water to his lips. Night after night, as we sit in the cooling desert air, fragments of his story surface. A village burned. A family lost. He speaks of it without emotion, a simple, brutal fact. One night, he tells me of a fever dream in the wilderness after he’d lost everything. Not of a god, but of a presence, a light that showed him the interconnectedness of all pain. “It was not a gift,” he whispers, his voice raspy. “It was a realignment. A way to remove the pain.” He keeps a simple, unadorned wooden box. From it, each night, he takes a small, dark stone, smooth as a river pebble, and places it on his tongue. His face contorts, a mask of agony and ecstasy intertwined. A low hum emanates from his chest, and for a moment, I feel it too—a ripple in the air, a profound connection to something vast and terrifying. It is a communion, yes, but it looks like a sacrifice.

My pleading became a constant, desperate litany. For three days, I was a ghost at his elbow, a mirror of the desperate hope I saw in the eyes of the sick. I think it was that reflection that finally broke him. Not my words, but the sight of my raw, selfish need, a hunger he knew all too well. On the third night, he turned to me, his eyes devoid of anger, only a profound exhaustion. ""It is not a god I have to share,"" he said, his voice a dry rasp. ""It is a burden."" He led me deeper into the temple, to a small, circular chamber, the air thick with the scent of old stone and something metallic. In the center stood a pedestal. On it rested a carving of dark, oiled wood—not a man or a beast, but a knot of writhing, interconnected forms, an endless, agonizing loop. It was a sculpture of pain itself. Beside it, on a clean cloth, lay a small, sharp silver knife. ""This is the shape of what you ask for,"" he said, his gaze intense. ""Before we go further, you must swear an oath. Three times. Swear that this power will only ever pass *through* you, to heal others, but never to rest within you. Swear that you will never turn it upon yourself. And swear that you will never refuse it to another, no matter the blackness of their soul or the nature of their sins.""

My mind was a roaring vacuum. The world, the years of searching, all of it narrowed to this single, terrible point of light. This was never about the world. This was for her. I would have sworn any oath, damned my soul a thousand times over, for a chance to undo my failure. My voice, when I spoke, was a stranger's, a hollow rasp that echoed in the stone chamber. ""I swear."" I repeated the words for each oath, the promises settling into my bones like ice. For the first time since I met him, a change came over Skrimar’s face. It was not a smile. It was the slow, painful release of a tension held for a lifetime. ""It is done,"" he breathed. ""The chain is not broken."" He took the silver knife. With a steady hand, he drew a shallow line across his own thumb, a welling of dark blood. Then, he turned the blade to me. I offered my hand without hesitation. The sting of the cut was a distant, meaningless thing. He pressed his bleeding thumb to mine. I did not felt anything special, but Skrimar suddenly relaxed.

""I feel nothing,"" I told him, the words hollow in the silent chamber. A sad, knowing smile touched Skrimar’s lips. ""It is not for you to feel. It is for you to channel. Place your hand on my brow."" My hand moved, drawn by the gravity of his suffering. The instant I touched his skin, I drowned in an ocean of pain. It was a phantom fire that seared my lungs, a crushing weight that fractured my bones. I collapsed.

As I gasped on the floor, Skrimar straightened. The years and sickness fell away from him, the sores and scars vanishing until a man of no more than thirty stood where the old healer had been. He laughed, a hollow, grating sound. ""I wasn't praying to a god,"" he said, his voice suddenly young and cruel. ""I was a con man who botched a summoning."" 

He gestured to the wooden box. ""Don't worry. You have a full supply of communion stones.”

“You call it fentanyl.""

My wife and I are flying from LAX into Tokyo Narita on 2/20 and flying back out on 3/1. I've spent over a month in Japan in the past, but this is her first time and she is incredibly excited. Our interests when we travel tend to be a mix of nature/scenic views/scenic landmarks, hiking, food, coffee, animals, good cocktails/bars, a night or two to splurge somewhere and relax, and wandering around cities.

Her only non-negotiables on this trip are spending ample time in Tokyo to explore and eat as well as an overnight at a ryokan near Jigokudani to see the snow monkeys.

We do well with a faster pace than most when it comes to traveling, but that doesn't mean we're choosing to rush around especially given this trip is quite short overall. This is the hypothetical itinerary I've mapped out for us:

2/20: arrive Narita around 4:30pm, get to hotel in Shibuya by 7/8pm, grab dinner and go to sleep

2/21: Tokyo

2/22: Tokyo

2/23: bullet train to Nagano in morning, bus to Jigokudani, stay overnight in Ryokan

2/24: snow monkeys in morning, bus + train back to Tokyo

2/25: Tokyo

2/26: early morning train from Shinjuku to Fujikawaguchiko, stay at Fufu Kawaguchiko overnight

2/27: train back to Tokyo

2/28: Tokyo

3/1: early evening flight out of Narita

Any thoughts or suggestions? I'm usually quite sure when I plan out a trip, but this one has me second guessing myself. Part of me wonders if Fuji is worth it, part of me wonders if too much time in Tokyo.

Other places we had been interested in was Beniya Mukayu for a luxury ryokan stay, Kyoto in general, and day trips to places like Kamakura/Enoshima or somewhere for the plum blossoms (Kawazu?). If you have any advice, please do share. Thank you!",1,1769066384.0,JapanTravelTips,1,1.0,False

I'll go straight up to the topic, l'm a stay at home and I always had a huge struggle to make friends, to everyone I look like a ""very social person"" however I always find myself with no one to talk to... I love horror/multiplayer games and yapping trough discord! Besides my husband I have 2 other friends (yes that’s how much of an issue I have!) 

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety ever since I was in my last job so the few friends I made eventually moved out to other cities or countries and tried to make more friends in the Virginia, I still struggle since last year and my actual number of friends keep declining since we don’t see each other as often or they just disappeared atp:,D

I'm a full time artist now and I have realized that I want friends to have discord calls with, I want to go out and have coffee, walk around with friends, eat out together, yk maybe even just be long distance friends. I have no clue how to socialize properly and no clue of where to start to get a nice and sincere friendship.

Does anyone have any advice or ideas for my situation?",2,1769066283.0,FriendshipAdvice,4,1.0,False

1qjnx8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qjnx8p/aitah_for_blocking_my_ex_boyfriend_and_all_his/,AITAH for blocking my ex boyfriend and all his friends entirely,"this was dated back 6 months ago and it was still bothering me so I'm writing this down for myself  
about last year when I was(20F) and my ex (19M) met at the first semester of university

we're from a city that people mostly date after the age of 18, most people are hyper focused on studying and obsessed with grades that it was both our first experience of dating.

Being the first semester of year one university student, there was an English class where we were in the same group. We are both in the science department where I'm mathematics major and he's physics major, I liked the banter and treated him as a friend, we have no prior dms or have any communication or texting, just twice a week of having breakfast with another friend A(20F) And I moved in a student dorm.

So during a 3 month period, no text no nothing, no dating during Christmas, the second semester came.

I met him again in a school society fair \[we aren't in the same class anymore\], we talked and had lunch for two weeks. Valentines came, I gave him a gift since I do to friends I love and cherish, and he confessed to me. I was... confused, and stupid so I said yes. I can't differentiate friends and romantic love at the time and we both have different views and styles of dating. He likes walking, going places by foot like a 8 hour walk, sometimes by bus while I like cafes, fine dine and indoor drawing that relaxes me.

It stressed me out for the first week, everyday he would come to my dorm entrance without asking if I want to hang out, I just went with the flow and usually we go to the library to study or just talk. We're mostly at the university since a 3.0 gpa for us means sleepless nights of studying and barely survive. So we have study dates and after that his long walks since he was insisting it would be romantic. I'm a person that only jog once or twice a week and low stamina that I would be exhausted at the end of the day when we reach dorm at 1am. While we were dating that week, I found out that he has palmar hyperhidrosis \[hand sweat problems\]. At first I thought it was cute that he's nervous seeing me, but it winter, when i hold his hand, mine scrunch up like being in a bath for too long and it grossed me out after a week. I would sometimes tell him ""oh, your hands can make a hand print"" and he joked about squeezing water out of it. Let's say I wasn't too entertained by his jokes. Also some comments about my English is worse than him while I help him edit his English scientific research paper that gets him an A- later on.

I was honestly considering if I should end the relationship after a week, but then, the second week I told him on saturday morning I'm not free since I have to bring laundry back home for wash, dorm washing machines are looked down upon and my family insisted that my clothes are washed by our house helper. He insisted to help me get the laundry back home despite I asked him 3 times that I don't want to bother him, which is an hour and a half bus ride back home \[I live with my parents\] He then know my address, where I live, even what room it is, and he joked that he would stalk me like a ghost if I dumped him. So I felt trapped. We also kissed later on that week, my first kiss, and he said, and I quote ""you're so lucky, you took my first kiss"". I might missed the memo of him being a red flag...

The fourth week we went to the university bar for a drink, he doesn't like any alcohol while I like wine. He nagged me about drinking while I tell him just try it since he never tried any alcohol ever since his dad had a bad alcoholic rep. I drink socially, a glass of wine sometimes loosen my social anxiety of contemplating what to say and lessen my overthinking tendencies. I told him that I turned down two invitations of boys for getting my contact, told him I bought him an (equivalent to 100 us dollar) water bottle that looks cool for a birthday present and told him insecurities I have, cried since I got emotional. I was probably being loud so he told me that we should get the check, I paid since he didn't get anything at the bar. We left the bar to the outside bench and he kissed me, and said I'm pretending to be drunk, according to him, drunk means that the person has no idea where they are and throw up in the sidewalk. I was stunned, and just didn't comment, he then ask me what do I want in life, I said just to take some control back in my life since most of it was spent on studying and fulfilling my parent's expectations, the normal stuff. He then kissed me, and said that I was his lover from a pass time and he imagine himself driving a van endlessly in his dreams.

like. what. the. fuck.

I'm not in spiritual in any kind, and even if that is the case, I think I should care since I'm living in the moment, he said treating me like a high school girl, picking me up from the dorm is enough and wanting more like coffee dates was too much to ask and he isn't comfortable with it. he said I was difficult. He doesn't have much money, part time job, living in the same room with his entire family, he said he was embarrassed if I call him when he is at home and have to step out of the house to answer. So asking for him to have late night calls was too much for him. But when I said we should end the relationship, he said, and I quote ""I won't let this relationship end, not like this, give me 4 years, and I'll make you happy""

At this point I feel stun locked, I like someone who can stand their ground but what am I actually hearing... later i went for my friends for advise, they said it's a two people relationship, if I wanna end it I should end it. I want to, but then he was always not emotionally occupied, exams are coming, he has his part time and also society responsibilities, I want to wait so that he has the mental capacity to digest the break up.

I liked him, enough that I bought him gifts for his birthday, paid for the birthday lunch, I pay for us if we go out since I have pocket money while he doesn't, he didn't give me comfort financially to rely on him for dates and movies, although he insists to pay, I paid if I wanted something nicer than cheap sushi and cafeteria food. I wanted him to save up since he wanted a dream car, but he think it's emasculating of me to do it. I'm his (girl?)friend, I want whats best for him, live a comfy life without me screwing over his financial plans. And he took it as I see him not being able to afford me. I told him multiple times, he thought I didn't mean it

We're both emotionally sensitive and he could sense something bothers me, but I guess we suck at communicating, I don't know how to tell him that he is stressing me out, that we always eat at the same places where I want something else, that he comes meet me before I can say no, it felt like stalking and over obsessive, or maybe I'm just paranoid, he keeps a tracking app on me, ask me who I talk to, and wants to barge in academic meetings with groupmates in the library if not for his part time job.

I was young, enough to not think things clearly, how I feel, but clearly if my period get affected and be late for 2 to 3 weeks while we only kiss and hug for 3 months, maybe I should have done something, anything.

One of my friend that has a love life even teased me about me having an ugly boyfriend with my ex shave dry(for some reason) and have cuts on his  face, I brushed it off but it haunts me that do I dump someone that I told myself I like his smarts? I question myself everyday that am I that shallow, that I just want a boyfriend as status and not actually like a person. What if I'm the person leading him on, that's bad at communicating and make him feel like I'm being difficult.

He was a kind person, caring gestures, bringing me water at lunch when I didn't ask, walk me to dorm everyday, study with me, and tell me that I don't need to dress pretty and get a comfy hoodie since I look too uptight, tho I do like to dress pretty and it's just his assumptions. He said I'm beautiful even without dressing up like a doll but then again he doesn't want me to build confidence of being a shallow girl that has too much confidence in looks that dominates their personality. But he was the one person who gave me attention and introduced me to his friends. He thinks I'm a kind person but I feel like it was a lot of assumptions and daydreaming for him since I'm a person that is mostly logical and skeptical with deep thoughts that loves hypotheticals, at least that's how I feel about myself.

And again, my body, literally biological hormones tell me he is giving me stress, headaches, late periods for the whole dating span of 4 months. then as he showed me an instagram reel of racism jokes(I don't think living far away from that race gives him or anyone a green card, joking about horrible history that made those people ancestors suffer, I feel like that's lack of respect, maybe it's culturally forgiven, but I grew up on the internet, friends made me aware and culturally sensitive of what is fucked up or not\[and yes it involves the n word\]), I decided to use it as an excuse to leave him. the semester ends, I moved out of dorm, I have an internship at the school as IT assistant, things are going great. the second time he came to pick me up during the internship, I sat him down and want to talk. He however, might have sensed that I was loosing interest and brought me flowers, my favorite are white roses, he bought me a bouquet of peonies claiming they are white roses. I was calm, maybe too logical for that matter.

I said I can't accept the flowers, and I would like to tell you what I think, and how i want to move on, and he cut me off my saying relationship needs work, going on about how I should be patient. That was the first time I raised my voice, that i don't want to be around him, the environment and people around him(since there was one time his friends made an assumption that I am his sex partner), that I feel uncomfortable being with him, he wanted to talk more, so he rode the bus with me, to. my. house.

Internally, I was freaking out, it reminds me that he knows where I live, I didn't panic, or I try not to be, to faze out the whole conversation. He said he won't give up one me, let's say I was more freaked out.

Luckily, after that i blocked his contact, his friends contact and everything, we never met again after that. On the downside, I study math, not many labs or classes that has collaborations and university friends drift away eventually, now I'm year two student, only a friend from high school that keep in touch once per month since she's busy, both my parents work to the bone and they don't communicate with me even in the same house since they're default is tired and talk bad about colleagues or food.

I was slowly getting worse in academics and its mentally chipping me away, I feel bad about cutting him off, maybe maintaining as a friend would do me wonders, but I was young, I don't know what to do, it feels lonely and damning that life feel like rotting and corroding. I want to unblock him, contact him, but something in my gut tells me it's the worst thing I could ever do, dumping someone and asking for attention again is just unforgivable in my mind. So I'm just in a miserable state. My social anxiety is back, I don't go much, I'm not eating healthy like I used to back when I was dating. It like the momentum have crashed. I feel like I'm isolating myself but no one in my social group, including my friend and family can listen to what I'm going through without judgement, either my friend have bias by saying everything I do is right, or my parents saying I should not have dated and it affects my grades and all that. It have been a stressful few months of just getting up in bed, or even deliberately eat a meal or two, I'm on academic warning and I don't even know why everything feel numb, I don't know why I'm so frustrated even tho I didn't cry or be sad after breakup. I feel like I did something wrong, AITAH",1,1769066020.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False
1qjnx3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/1qjnx3u/make_a_moo_minigame_the_rules_of_packing/,Make A Moo Mini-game: The Rules of Packing,"I played the minigame and I had quite some fun. But I guess some people want to rank, so I decided to make this guide for people who want to rank on the leaderboards by knowing what to expect in advance. 

Game can be played here: [https://makeamoo.paydaythegame.com/](https://makeamoo.paydaythegame.com/)  
If you just started out playing for the first time, you can choose not to view the rest of the post so you don't get spoiled.  
  
To quickly recap on the rules of this mini-game:

\- Ensure the Moos have all the parts: two eyes, two ears, two arms, two legs.  
  
\- If any part is defective, cut them off and attach new parts to it. Only applicable on Day 2 onwards.  
  
\- Add the meth in only when the rules apply (these rules are in black). As long as any of the rules are true, you must put in meth.  
  
\- If DO NOT ADD rules apply, they take priority over the rules. (these restrictions are in red)  
  
\- Be aware of the quota and error limits. You will die at the end of the day if:  
\--> You fail to reach the quota (somehow)  
\--> You exceed the error limit.   
\--> Errors occur if you violate the rules on adding meth (or not adding meth)   
\--> Defects occur if you forget to zip up the Moo, or the Moo is incomplete, or any part is defective. 



With that in mind, here is the list of rules (which turns out are all the same, thank god). I will also leave some remarks about special things to look out for.

**Day 1**

**(Remarks: Not much. This is meant to be easy...but the calm before the storm. The shitstorm.)**

https://preview.redd.it/rsbth7zjgueg1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac966781a4873bbb78b12f5a70b0cdd9ff4e5bd0

**Day 2**  
**(Remarks: You need to start to remove defects from the Moo from this stage onwards.)**

https://preview.redd.it/8a2489lpgueg1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b88e25b38860744eaf7dd5ea3d6b4e346b69fe1

**Day 3**  
**(Remarks: Ensure that both criteria apply for the rule to be true.)**

https://preview.redd.it/5l0rt37tgueg1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a14a4011ea4e1c0d40eee71fe3444b9dfacb00d

**Day 4**  
**(Remarks: This is when restrictions start to appear. Remember that if the restriction applies to the Moo, ignore ALL the rules and do not put the meth in.)**

https://preview.redd.it/4gzhvl8vgueg1.png?width=673&format=png&auto=webp&s=b91d35c775c4145fbceb81b1d7580f6b0c5f1985

**Day 5**  
**(Remarks: This day is unique in that it is entirely composed of restrictions. Oh btw, cool Moos are the plushies which wear** ***cool sunglasses*****.)**

https://preview.redd.it/nkhdfynxgueg1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=64f7cbf6828a1c436c44b247a3903341de934af6

**Day 6**  
**(Remarks: The ""every third Moo"" rule may trip you up, or at least it tripped me up. Third Moo is not the third moo in the box, but its 3,6,9,12... I suggest keeping a running total in your brain, or count with your fingers.)**

https://preview.redd.it/ofz9t6izgueg1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0050b05f3dab5040de3a002ebeef290f40564be

**Day 7**  
**(Remarks: Lmao no rules! This is easy! What is the catch?**  
**YOU MUST ATTACH ALL PARTS TO EVERY MOO!**  
**This day is a test of your speed and precision! Be quick, but be careful! You have 0 errors allowed this time!)**

https://preview.redd.it/tisgyyd1hueg1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=e92d0367901f72e9ab1d0157005ce503453d893d

**Day 8**  
**(Remarks: The rules are typed out here based on my interpretation, as the rules sheet is stained with coffee.**

**Note that the ""Name is ???"" is a guess based on Day 10, I have actually not seen any orange Moo in my playthroughs that involve this rule.**

**Compared to Day 6's ""Every third moo"", this ""every fourth Moo"" is much easier. The last Moo in every box has this restriction.)**

https://preview.redd.it/9iimjsw6hueg1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2f24435fbf86a54d0a0bf6565c6bd35bffdc688

**Day 9**  
**(Remarks: This is the first time where there are two rulesets, and the rules will change halfway. I tested and its based on remaining time, not your progress. So if you see the time approach the time limit, get ready to adjust your gameplay!)**

***(First ruleset applies from 3:00)***

https://preview.redd.it/iojg7wjchueg1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff4304f1bcb4c5c2a43d8692f1b24af9b915c53d

***(Second ruleset applies at 1:30)***

**Day 10**

**(Remarks: This is the home stretch, but also the hardest one. Two things to take note:**

**(1) The boss will roam around and watch you work 3 times throughout the 5 minutes. If you submit a mistake, you will instantly die on the spot. This bumps up the stress even more, but you can avoid the boss by pausing the game and waiting until you hear footsteps go away. Yes it's cheating, but why give yourself undue stress of a gun pointed at your head???**

**(2) The rules will change SIX TIMES! Take note of the time limits that trigger the rule change.**

**You need to pack 2.5 boxes minimum, but you have 5 minutes this time, the longest time allowed. If needed, slow down and work through the rules before submitting, especially if the boss is behind you. (or just pause))**

***(First ruleset applies from 5:00)***

https://preview.redd.it/72uc0jdqhueg1.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=eec5ed4e20ba27745a5a22f04bcb471888b0c481

***(Second ruleset applies from 4:30)***

https://preview.redd.it/f1lko9zwhueg1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=3043bef9d3972f9256919d248b5edae0bf426acc

***(Third ruleset applies from 3:30)***

https://preview.redd.it/k7stu471iueg1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=99ea56a12d9233cadd62e7424db57738077b024d

***(Fourth ruleset applies from 3:00)***  
***(NOTE: The Moos you get during this time will generate with more defects that you need to fix, so be careful.)***

https://preview.redd.it/dq6advn5iueg1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=96e6d6a64afae39d53831641d73313f8eeb7de55

***(Fifth ruleset applies from 2:00)***  
***(NOTE: I believe I can confirm that the name is Irene. IIRC when I submitted a Moo that is purple and had the name Irene, without the meth, and was marked as an error.)***

https://preview.redd.it/35w3764fiueg1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad0066f1081730969e11776a2f923d442e4c862

***(FINAL ruleset applies from 1:00)***

https://preview.redd.it/bbyjx1hkiueg1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fdd34d260c7ce2fca85b76d58e4038e6429f48e

That's it! Hope you have the rules at your fingertips so you know what to expect and aim for the leaderboards. But honestly...

1qjnwq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1qjnwq5/did_my_dad_know_dreams_and_signs_before_he_left/,Did my dad know? Dreams and signs before he left 💔,"17 weeks ago, my dad, who seemed perfectly healthy, full of life, and happy, was suddenly gone. Just three days after we had coffee together and spent hours laughing and talking at my parent’s place, he wasn’t here anymore. I still can’t wrap my head around it. 😔

In the two months before he left, he had several bad dreams — 3 or 4 at least that left him sad, quiet, lost in thought. He never told my mom what they were about. I can’t stop wondering if he somehow felt something was coming.

Around the same time, he started pushing me to find a good partner and start my own family — more than usual. Like he wanted to make sure certain things were done, certain hopes were fulfilled.

He also started talking a lot about his childhood. He’d tell my mom stories she already knew, but she listened each day because she saw how happy it made him to share them.

I keep asking myself: was this a premonition? Did he somehow sense his time was near, even if he didn’t fully understand it?

I’ve read stories of others whose loved ones had messages, visions, or dreams before passing and shared them with their loved ones.

 I keep wondering if maybe life is already written in a way we don’t understand — if beginnings and endings are already in our “life book.”

# Kaji accidentally quits the Council

# Mattucci's campaign problem

# Better Way to honor Tanouye

# Pushing back on PAC

Jon Kaji unintentionally quit his District 1 Council seat in March, 2023.

How did that happen? He changed his voter registration address to his office address, which is not in District 1. The Municipal Code says officeholders automatically vacate their offices if their new addresses are outside the areas they are elected to serve.

Why would he do something so silly? And how is he still on the Council – running for re-election, no less?

To understand what happened – and why – we have to go back several years.

Kaji wanted to become a city council member. Not in Rancho Palos Verdes where he lives in a home for which he takes his homeowners tax credit. No, for some reason he has never explained, he wanted to serve in Torrance.

So, he needed to find a place in Torrance – even if he rented rather than bought. Because he likes the Peninsula lifestyle, he was able to replicate it on Calle de Arboles. The street is backed up by Palos Verdes Estates, and the homes resemble those of their PVE neighbors.

At Council meetings, he has talked about walking his dog in the Upper Riviera, an area he calls pleasant.

When he moved into his Torrance rental, the city’s elections were areawide. But before Kaji had a chance to run, the city was divided into districts. Kaji and Aurelio Mattucci lived in the same district, No. 5. They were friends. No way was he going to run against his pal. So Kaji moved back to RPV and bided his time. He ran for an open seat – District 1 – in 2022.

District 1 has many homes as lovely as those in District 5. But the Torrance Refinery is in the area, and it has a grittier feel to it. Certainly, no one has seen Kaji walking his dog. In fact, they don’t see Kaji at all.

His neighbors say he doesn’t live there. They would see him stopping by to pick up mail, but then he would leave shortly after.

Kaji had a problem: The City sends important mail to elected officials’ registered addresses, which the law says needs to be their homes, not their workplaces. That meant he had to make regular visits for the mail. He took office in July 2022. By the following March he changed his registration address to his office, which state law prohibits.

Someone saw he had changed his registration. When I recently learned about this incident, I asked if they could send me a copy of the registration change. They did.

Apparently, a friend told him what he had unwittingly done, and he changed back to the house that he rents in District 1. He was out of compliance for about two weeks.

While I was researching this story, some of the people who knew it had happened were puzzled why neither the city clerk nor city attorney had stepped up to say that Kaji had vacated the seat and that the Council needed to either appoint a successor or call for a special election.

In the case of the city clerk, the answer is easy. Rebecca Poirier has no investigative or enforcement duties. And in government speak, that means that officials **cannot** do something if it isn’t on their list of duties.

For the city attorney, it is apparently more complicated. Stepping in would be considered a conflict of interest. Evidently, only the district attorney could decide if this was a case to consider pursuing.

The question: Who is supposed to bring it to the district attorney? The answer is murky. A lawyer, who is an expert on municipal government, told me that whoever wrote Torrance’s statute did a sloppy job.

At this point, Kaji will probably not face consequences since he quickly fixed his blunder. But as one of my sources who had heard about the incident put it, “He almost registered himself out of office.”

Now it’s up to the voters to send him back home to Rancho Palos Verdes.

# Mattucci has a campaign problem:

People are mocking Aurelio Mattucci’s Treasurer campaign website post in which he tries to paint a picture of great financial acumen. Many remember how in a post a few years ago, he talked about his needing the City’s health insurance.

In the new post, he starts by saying, “When done with school, I helped build a plumbing company from scratch.”

One person said that Mattucci, who is not a plumber, was taking credit for his brother Guido’s business, adding, “I wonder what Guido thinks of that.”

Others have parsed his statement and pointed that Mattucci was “done with school” earlier than most. He quit high school after a couple of years. And, as they have told me, if he helped his brother, it was at best as an entry-level helper who was not licensed.

But this is the statement that has raised eyebrows: “Today, I actively manage a $50 million portfolio with 20 employees.” Sources are saying that his claim, which implies that he is doing well financially, does not gibe with legal documents that he has filed.

Mattucci’s annual 700 statements, which are the state-required financial disclosure forms for elected officials, are consistent. Several people sent me the link to them, and one person generously texted me the documents. He consistently has checked the box that says his income is between $10,000 and $100,000 annually.

The same source who texted me the 700s also texted me all the documents of Mattucci’s divorce. In the court document, he declares that he grosses $50,000 a year from his real estate work. The divorce was amicable. Apparently, Mattucci’s paperwork is public record. It could have been sealed, but he didn’t think to do that.

Future newsletters will tackle his lack of financial acumen.

 \* \* \*

# Treasurer’s race overview:

Current Treasurer Tim Goodrich has not said whether he will run, but he has made it clear that his candidacy is unlikely.

That leaves a three-way race with Mattucci, former Council member Mike Griffiths and perennial candidate Charles Deemer. I predict that Griffiths will crush Mattucci and Deemer. If you want to know more about Griffiths, go to [**www.ILikeMike4torrance.com**](http://www.ilikemike4torrance.com/).

# A better way to honor Tanouye:

Hats off to District 6’s Jeremy Gerson for his master stroke at the Jan. 13 City Council meeting. His proposal for honoring World War II hero Ted T. Tanouye was appropriate and elegant.

For more details, read Madeline Armstrong’s Daily Breeze story at

[**www.dailybreeze.com/2026/01/14/torrance-councilmember-proposes-new-park-honoring-local-war-hero-ted-t-tanouye/**](http://www.dailybreeze.com/2026/01/14/torrance-councilmember-proposes-new-park-honoring-local-war-hero-ted-t-tanouye/).

Gerson gets even more kudos for saying that he hopes that the two proposals on the table spark residents’ imaginations so that they come up with other ideas for the Parks and Recreation Commission to consider. The first proposal – from Kaji – was not well thought out. He, Mayor George Chen and Mattucci tried to rush the original proposal through without enough resident input.

Gerson’s proposal is proof that giving an issue time for careful consideration is the way to go. If you have missed this controversy, check out any recent newsletter at [**www.TakeBackTorrance.com**](http://www.takebacktorrance.com/).

# Oops:

Newsletter No. 75 talked about Dylan Wakayama violating City policy. It referred to him as a Planning commissioner. He is an Airport commissioner. My error, but I am now doubly surprised by his breaking the rules.

Last year, the Airport Commission was temporarily shut down by the City Council because it had violated some basic policies. Its members were given some remedial training, so it’s especially surprising that Wakayama flaunted the rules on proper behavior.

# What the Constitution Means to Me:

It means a lot, actually, but that is the title of the Broadway play coming to the Armstrong Theatre.

If you missed it at the Mark Taper a couple of seasons ago, you have another opportunity: The Torrance Cultural Arts Foundation is putting on an evening show on Saturday, Jan. 24, and a matinee the next day. Go to the Armstrong Box Office or [**www.TorranceArts.org**](http://www.torrancearts.org/) for tickets.

Rep Ted Lieu and the Torrance League of Women Voters are supplying copies of the Constitution for ticketholders.

\* \* \*

# Pushing back on the PACs:

In 2006 then-Mayor Dan Walker put the arm on donors for five-figure contributions to his re-election bid. He raised more than $400,000.

Then-Council member Frank Scotto couldn’t match his dollars, but he rallied the voters who tossed Walker and his sidekick Mike Mauno out of office.

Twenty years later we are seeing a replay. Scotto and his Council instituted donation limits. But Chen is using a PAC to skirt that so that he and his candidates will be flush with funds. The PAC succeeded for Chen, Mattucci and Kaji in 2022. But it failed dismally in 2024.

Though Andrew Lee and Tony Yeh each got $73,000, they were both defeated.

In 2026, Chen’s slate is raising funds for himself and all the candidates he is supporting. What I am calling the Good Government 4 need financial help.

Sharon Kalani, Betty Lieu, David Kartsonis and Asam Sheikh don’t need to match the PAC, but they need to raise enough money to get their messages out. Kalani is the only candidate everyone in Torrance can vote for. The others will also make decisions that impact everyone.

You may not be able to vote for those candidates, but you can help get them elected. To give the Good Government 4 money, to take their yard signs, to make phone calls, to give them coffees, to canvas for them, go to these websites:

\* \* \*

# Campaign kickoffs:

Sheikh, Lieu, Kartsonis and Kalani have now all had successful starts. They drew big crowds who came with dollars to get them launched.

Former Mayors Scotto and Pat Furey showed up for Kalani and Kartsonis’s events. The two ex-mayors talked about how they disagreed on various issues, but they agreed on good government. I wouldn’t be surprised to see campaign material showing photos with each of the candidates flanked by Scotto and Furey, who are asking voters to support Kalani and, in District 1, Kartsonis.

Chen’s slate got off to a somewhat embarrassing start. Torrance bars photos of public buildings in campaign literature. But Chen’s folks used a photo of City Hall in a pitch for people to attend what they called a Town Hall. After complaints that they were misleading people into thinking that this was a City-sponsored event, they changed the photo for the Jan. 14 event to a shot of Torrance Airport. Which is also City property, but doesn't evoke a government feel.

A couple of people who went told me attendance was abysmal – there were almost as many candidates as people coming to hear what they had to say. And some candidates not running for a Torrance office – like perennial candidate Steve Williams – don’t live in Torrance.

Thanks to Jimmy Gow for sending me the video of the event. Nothing of consequence was said.

Im also working out 1-2x a week.

Most of my days i am totally alone. My husband works in the office so we only meet evenings and breakfast. Sometimes not even breakfast as I am still sleeping lol

So far I only interact with my husband, I dont have a gym buddy and since I work remotely, I only interact with coworkers online but we do work independently so theres really not much interaction even online.

meeting friends is very seldom. i only have few friends actually. and maybe not even that close as most people's friends.

i dont know whats happening to me, im already in my 30s but i feel like i dont have that ""push"" to work or to do things not like during my 20s. maybe my life is too easy and too comfortable plus im isolated thats why my willpower is decreasing...

\*I mentioned too easy and too comfortable as my current work is quite easy and very rare to have busy season, most of the time I can procrastinate. I usually go out of house and work in coffee shops because staying at home makes me sleepy even though I have the much better work setup at home compare to coffee shops. But still I spend most of my day everyday wondering what to do instead of actually doing it. Like I have many ideas on what to do with my side businesses and things that I need to do like process orders, practice CAD more, study something etc. but instead doing them one at a time, my brain is kinda lagging and always wondering and end up procrastinating. I tried planning and scheduling tasks in advance but i always end up canceling them. I could have achieve so much as im lucky to have an easy stable remote job that i can do with side businesses but im not maxxing out the benefits, instead i procrastinate.",1,1769065834.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

Like… the way everybody acts like he can do no wrong. The way his mood decides the whole day. The way one small sentence from him changes people’s behavior like a switch.

It’s crazy.

If he comes in smiling, suddenly the office is alive. People laughing. People talking. Even the coffee tastes better. If he comes in quiet or annoyed, the whole place gets cold. Everybody typing extra loud like it proves something. Nobody jokes. Nobody breathes too hard. It’s like we all become background characters.

And the funny part is nobody admits it. Everyone acts normal. But you can see it. People watch him like he’s the weather report. Like, do we get sunshine today or do we get storm. Because if it’s storm, you better stay out the way.

He’ll say one thing and it becomes law. Doesn’t matter if it makes sense. Doesn’t matter if it’s fair. If he says “we need this by today,” people will move mountains. If somebody else says it, it’s a discussion. With him, it’s automatic panic.

Sometimes I look around and think… why are we like this. Then I remember. Paychecks. Bills. Rent. Life. We act brave online and then a manager clears his throat and we sit up straight like we’re in school again.

I’m not even saying he’s a bad person. Some bosses are cool. Some are actually trying. But the power is still weird. Like no matter how grown you are, a boss can still make you feel small. You can be 30 years old and still get nervous when they say “can you come to my office?” That sentence alone can ruin your whole lunch.

And don’t get me started on the boss jokes. Everyone got two personalities. One personality is normal human. The other personality is “yes sir, absolutely sir, great point sir.” People be switching voices like it’s a customer service call.

The only time my boss feels like a normal person is when he laughs at something stupid. Then I’m like okay, he’s human. For two minutes. Then he goes back to boss mode and everyone goes back to acting like he’s the main character.

So yeah, my boss is a god. Not because he’s perfect. But because everybody treats him like his mood is the law of nature.

The $100 Dinner And His Cheap Love

Chapter 1
Ever since my husband and his mother found out I had coffee with my colleague, they've been treating me differently.

My husband, Brian Cole, slapped a bill against my face.

""Here, take this one hundred to buy groceries. My mother is coming over tonight, and I expect a proper dinner on the table.""

""There had better be fish and shrimp. And make sure the pork ribs are stewed till tender.""

I pinched the bill between my fingers, my hand shaking.

The supermarket was packed. Shrimp cost thirty-eight a pound, ribs forty-five, and even a small freshwater fish ran seventeen.

With just a hundred dollars, I couldn't even afford onions after buying the meat.

He then set me up in the family group chat by ""praising"" me, thinking it would pressure me into delivering: \[My wife is the best at managing the household—a hundred bucks can cover a whole feast.\]

His mother, Margaret Cole, sent a voice message, ""Don't let her skim anything. Check the receipts.""

Six o'clock in the evening. Margaret arrived.

In the middle of the table was a bowl of plain boiled pasta without even sauce on it.

Brian slammed the table and shouted, ""Where's the fish? Where's the meat? Did you give the money to your lover?""

I ripped off my apron and threw it on the floor, ""Expecting a lavish feast for a hundred bucks? This meal is just right for feeding dogs.""

\*\*\*

The veins on Brian's forehead bulged, his face twisting, ""Feeding dogs? Elowen, have you lost your mind?""

He jumped to his feet, arm raised, a slap aimed straight at my face.

I stepped back and stared at him coldly, ""Go ahead. Touch me and see what happens.""

His hand froze in midair.

Margaret slammed her fork onto the table and began wailing, ""Good lord, what did we do to deserve this? My son went and married a good-for-nothing, wasteful wretch!""

""Showing such disrespect to her husband, and now she has the gall to insult me to my face!""

""My son works himself to the bone to support this family. You flirt outside over coffee, then come home and won't even cook a decent meal.""

""This is simply unbearable!""

She cried as she spoke, stealing glances at Brian to gauge his reaction.

All because I had been discussing a project with a male colleague downstairs and she happened to see us.

By the time I got home, it had turned into ironclad proof that I was unfaithful.

""Elowen, I don't hit women, but you went too far today,"" Brian said through clenched teeth, pointing at the bowl of pasta.

""One hundred bucks can't buy real food in this city? Do you think we're idiots?""

""You must have given the money to that other man!""

Margaret egged him on from the sidelines, ""Brian, check her accounts. Drag that man out.""

I looked at the absurd pair of them and laughed despite myself.

""One hundred bucks? Brian, do you really not know what things cost now, or are you pretending to be stupid?""

""Shrimp is thirty-eight, ribs forty-five. Even a slightly bigger fish costs twenty.""

""Do you want me to steal at the market, or go rob someone?""

He froze for a second, then flushed with rage.

""Shut up! How come other men's wives can manage just fine on a tight budget? Why is it excuses after excuses with you?""

""It's because your heart isn't in this family anymore.""

He stepped over the apron on the floor and closed in on me, reaching for my collar.

""Hand over your phone! I want to see your messages and your transfer records.""

""If you don't explain where that hundred went today, this isn't over.""

I slapped his hand away and looked at the man I had once loved, a hollow chill spreading through me.

We had been married three years. To protect his pride, I had never mentioned that I earned five times what he did.

The mortgage, the car payments, utilities, and all bills were on autopay from my account.

His meager salary, aside from the occasional fruit, all went straight into his mother's pocket.

And now, over one hundred dollars, he wanted to audit me.

""Brian, are you sure you want to check?"" I asked, my voice flat. ""You may regret it.""

He sneered, full of contempt, ""Regret? What I regret is marrying a two-faced traitor like you!""

""Give him your phone!"" Margaret chimed in eagerly. ""Make this bitch show her true colors today!""

I took out my phone, unlocked it, and tossed it onto the table. ""Go ahead.""

Brian shot me a suspicious look and grabbed it.

Margaret leaned in too, their heads pressed together, fingers flicking rapidly across the screen.

Specifically flavored iced lattes. But recently with my new job it’s become inconvenient for me to buy a latte every morning from Dunkin or Starbucks so I’ve decided to start trying to make these lattes at home. Problem is, the actual coffee is the one thing I can’t get right. I’ve tried just using a regular pot of coffee, a moka pot, a cheap espresso machine that wasn’t really espresso at all. Nothing tastes right. I even got a shot of espresso from Dunkin and used it in my coffee, just to make sure I wasn’t bugging. And nope, the espresso made all the difference.

So I’ve decided I’m gonna try making espresso at home. But I had no clue were to start. I’m not willing to absolutely break the bank, but I do want a reliable machine. I see so many mixed reviews on different machines so I’d like to hear from some experts on what machine I should buy to start my home latte journey!",0,1769065471.0,espresso,7,0.5,False
1qjnr6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscordGroupRP/comments/1qjnr6p/modern_fantasy_back_roads_city_lights/,[Modern Fantasy] Back Roads & City Lights,"*Back Roads & City Lights* is a modern-fantasy role-play set in Seattle, Washington, and the surrounding sprawl—from rain-slick downtown streets and neon-lit alleys to quiet coastal towns and the shadowed edges of the Cascades. On the surface, it’s coffee shops, tech start-ups, ferry rides, and traffic on I-5. Underneath, it’s Veil Accords, old blood pacts, and things with teeth and claws that never left when the world moved on. Vampires, werewolves, witches, hunters, and utterly mundane humans all move through the same city lights and back roads, working, loving, surviving… and trying very hard not to let the truth slip into the headlines.



The group focuses on character-driven, freeform storytelling: slice-of-life scenes, slow-burn drama, supernatural investigations, quiet horror, and the messy politics of keeping the secret in a city wired with cameras and social media. Want to play the exhausted FBI agent who keeps catching cases that don’t make sense, the bartender whose regulars include both wolves and cops, the occultist in a Capitol Hill walk-up who knows too much, or the hunter who’s starting to doubt the cause? There’s a rich, established lore foundation—werewolf packs, vampire societies, hunter cells, government departments, and more—but it’s built to give you hooks, not fences.



*Back Roads & City Lights* is a collaborative sandbox for players who enjoy long-term arcs, found family, and consequences that actually matter. Plots can be intimate or sprawling: a single rainy night in a Pioneer Square alley, a multi-thread investigation running from Belltown to the backwoods, or the slow unraveling of a character who realizes the world is nothing like they thought. If you’re looking for a grounded modern setting with room to tell your stories—where the supernatural is hidden but never passive—we’d be happy to have you pull off the highway, park under the flickering neon, and step into the dark with us.



* An 18+ Semi-Lit to Novella Modern Fantasy Role-Play.
* Deep World Lore thats always expanding and evolving.
* Multiple locations within the Puget Sound Area to play within. From the mist-filled forests of the Cascades, to the urban sprawl of the Seattle metro area

1qjnozj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforWaywards/comments/1qjnozj/bp_and_i_are_in_a_cool_off_and_im_spiraling/,BP and i are in a cool off and i’m spiraling,"i know it sounds very selfish but when i went to therapy 4 days ago i just understood our attachment styles and why BP and i were different.

BP is a fearful avoidant while i’m an attached preoccupied. BP needing space was like limbo for me, but i’m still glad that BP still chose to agree to a date where we would talk again.

for context, i did sex work for a year on and off and BP found out 18 days ago, right after my birthday. they found out about it while they were scrolling through my phone. then i trickled truth them until every day they would find out stuff that i did not say by scrolling more on my phone—mainly because of the shame and guilt that i did those things for money. BP asked me for the reason why i did it, and i told them it was ultimately for money and for exploring kinks even though everything was done online.

fast forward i stayed at their house for a week, even with BP angrily saying i should go home and leave them alone. 3 days in i begged and pleaded and asked for forgiveness, and to start anew again. i was helpless and always had panic attacks in front of BP and they would get triggered and begin verbally abusing me, which i took because i know i deserved it, and any pleadings of getting back together were shut down immediately because i destroyed our relationship of 4 years, and said we’d never get back together. when BP was calm, the last 4 days i stayed at their house i asked them if we can fix this together and still be together. BP said they don’t know and are still confused. they kept talking that if we’re meant to be then it will be, maybe 4-5 years from now and we’ll meet somewhere else and have coffee and stuff. when we’re actually stable and more mature.

we talked deeply about why i did it and BP said if i could have just told them the truth they would accept me and support what i was doing. i told BP that i am too ashamed, too guilty, and i didn’t want them to see me that way, that that was what i had to do for money at the time. BP said that they accepted the fact already, but still need space and time to process. they also said that the reason they want me out of the house is because they can’t control their words whenever they get triggered, and BP can’t even believe that they were able to manage saying those hurtful stuff to me. they also said that they ache and long to do things for me that they once did, like giving me slippers or kissing me every night before i go to sleep.

BP then began to pity me and asked if i can survive a cool off. i immediately said yes. i don’t know if it was the only thing they had in mind so i can go home before, but i took it wholeheartedly. the day after, BP saw my personal account that i made my diary and saw that i was falling in love with a client. i told BP that i was exaggerating, and didn’t actually fall for the client. i also told BP the truth that i did send one explicit photo and the client sent multiple ones, because that’s what it’s all about. i explained that i got attached because i needed companionship, someone to talk to, and it just so happened that i was still starting off and the money and filling the time was a good idea at that moment. then BP told me that the only revenge they really want is for me to see them that they are happy and can live with me. it broke my heart.

BP got mad again. but they didn’t react any further. they were just disappointed. they said they couldn’t even trust what was coming out of my mouth anymore. BP has a history of having trauma from cheating, because both BP’s parents cheated on each other while they were growing up and had their extended family take care of them. but BP is also a very grudge-holding person. BP didn’t talk to their mother or sister for 2 years because they got into a fight and they still continue to ignore their sister whenever they have small fights.

in the end, we agreed to have a cool off. i was gonna give BP the time and space they needed to process stuff, and i’d go home. we still did have some sexual activity for the last 4 days. but it wasn’t like before. BP also tried doing new stuff incorporating BDSM, and BP took the lead. then BP also told me to take the lead and see how i would do it. but those time when we did not incorporate BDSM, the sex was just too different. no more loving looks, and BP even just scrolled on their phone at one time maybe because looking at me hurts too much. there were times that they initiated but it was purely carnage and then it was done. the last time we did it, BP told me that they only own my body and if anyone else touches me the way they do, they’d kill me.

the next day, i went home. BP dropped me off and they were still updating me and calling me by our pet name, even though the tension was there. i still gladly took it. the next day, i asked permission to go over their house because i left something important and when my prof announced we have no classes, i asked if i could stay and BP just said yes. we had small talks not until my anxiety built up again and i began to plead. BP reacted furiously and began to tell me hurtful things. i just looked at them in the eye and began crying and did not have a reaction. BP said that if it’s not working anymore then they’ll come up with another plan. i told BP to calm down and hug each other, and snuggle. BP said they are going somewhere later so if i can make it quick, they’ll set an alarm. we stayed in that position and when i began to initiate BP pulled back and said no. i told BP but what about the stuff you said back then about me being yours? BP said to forget all that stuff.

we prepared because BP’s friends were already calling them. i rushed to use the bathroom and when their ride arrived they just said they had to go and gave me a quick peck—also not sure if they did it out of habit too. we said our goodbyes and i also rode on my ride which also arrived.

the day after that, i stayed at home and then my friend immediately messaged me that BP sent them a message. they had a long exchange of messages and BP asked some stuff that they were not able to get more clarity because everytime i found out about something, i would delete everything. even the screenshots on their phone. but by this time i already told BP the whole truth. nothing else. they also vented to that friend who knew everything. they mentioned that BP loves me, twice. but the trauma of cheating was just too deep. BP also mentioned to me back then that if they were to forgive me, it would be breaking their principle and who they are as a person. when BP saw that they were not able to find more info, they admitted that they were scared to find out new info again and that i lied, again.

that same night after BP messaged my friend they taunted me asking where my dad was. i told them i don’t know because when i got home i went straight to my room. BP kept implying that my dad was at the room too or at the living room. i then told them that whatever actions they would take, may it be telling my dad or what, i’d gladly accept it because i deserve the punishment. then BP took it back and said they would not tell my parents, and said they’re not that evil. BP acknowledged my accountability by saying yup, thank you and used my first name. it was like a splash of water.

the next few days i just said good morning, one update, and good night. BP told me i could still message them and update so i took that as a sign to still message. i did give them reassurance from time to time and most of the time they’d just react a laughing emoji and at one time even replied with a fuck you selfie then removed it.

their social media is also confusing. at one point they deleted all the photos where i was in them on their public account, then ultimately deleted all posts. BP only left one repost about cheating. but on their private account, they initially removed our photos but at one point put them back together. they also reposted stuff about getting hurt. i understood.

we did have an agreement that they would remind me about meds every night because when i was at their place i kept on forgetting to take it. even though the timing was not consistent there was not a day where they would miss reminding me.

there came a point one saturday night while i was so down and had literally no one else to talk to. the first therapist that i booked cancelled on me, and i had another problem at home that only they knew about. it became unbearable and i had thoughts about offing myself to settle the guilt and at the same time forget all problems so i had no choice but to turn to them for comfort.

what was only meant as a visit for a hug and crying session turned out to be more. BP got worried and initiated physical contact first by holding my hand, and i asked for a hug. i asked them how they’ve been and BP avoided the question and asked what was i doing there.

i did not answer and just cried and they said if i'm not yet ready to share then it's ok.

they told me eventually that BP’s whole family knew that i cheated. BP got drunk the other day and blurted out that i cheated. BP has been absent minded about chores at home and got reprimanded but luckily BP was defended by the kids at home. their uncle then asked what was the problem all about and they said that it's something that can be resolvable by talk.

they also mentioned that distractions are getting boring, that BP has just been playing games all day and taking all work in their organization to keep them busy. BP sleeps early now and wakes up early then works and goes to sleep until it's night. they mentioned that the days are blurring for them and doesn't have any idea what day it is because the days are super fast.

i asked BP if the space i've given them the past few days were enough, like the updates and all. they said no. everytime BP sees my update they’re reassured that i'm ok, but at the same time they feels anger. BP even said that they can't look at me right now because they’re gonna get reminded of the pain.

i asked BP how they were feeling. BP said that they feels

 nothing, no anger and no sadness. just worry. worried that i came over crying. they also sensed that i was gonna give in and break our cool off but they said they didn't expect it to be that early. i did ask BP for a reassurance if there's still a chance for us. they sighed heavily and said that's the purpose of february 1, and didn't answer. when i kinda felt safe because they shared first, i also told them about the problem i recently found out at home.

after a while, BP was going on about something saying they ""cared for me"", and i backtracked and said ""cared?"" then they corrected themself and said ""still cares."" BP said that i'm still human and that i can lean on them, on my friends when times get tough.

after a while, it was getting late so BP said i should head home. they said i can't stay over at their house because there were a lot of people there and there's no room for me to sleep in. i also said it's ok because now their family knows they now hate me too. i offered BP what about sleeping in my place? because i really just wanted to be with them because i haven't been sleeping well ever since. it took them a long while to answer before they said no. they explained that they had to be early and that's the reason why there were people at their house and all that because they have to be up early. BP also said they’re scared how my family would react, that they'd get mad at BP instead of me because they'll obviously side with me. i said there's no worries about that, and i'll explain the situation to them.

in the end, BP just said that they'll sleep over by february 1 and i got a bit excited because we never really had privacy whenever we talked about stuff at their place. it's also the second time that they’re coming over with my parents knowing they’re gonna come. lastly before going, i asked BP one final reassurance: if they still love me.

they sighed deeply again and pulled back. BP said yes, they still love me. but they are ""floating"", and i don't know what that means. so i said i'm sorry for asking again, because i forgot about feb 1 and they really wanted to postpone relationship talk by then. before my ride came, BP asked me ""are you sure you're ok?"" and i just smiled at them and said yeah i am.

this time they stared at me and said ""you know, i now know whenever you're lying"" and grabbed me for a hug. BP also said that their pet peeve are liars but i sobbed and wailed on their shoulder while they kept on hugging me.

a few mins after, they messaged me saying ""let me know if you arrived safely at home, ok?"" and i told them yeah i am home, i walked for a while to clear my thoughts. they just replied with a sigh again and then i told them several stuff, some of them including not going to their house later to pick up the glasses i left, telling them that they can block me everywhere so they can feel safe in their accounts without me on it, and i offered that i can take my meds without them reminding me about it. i also sent them a screenshot of me telling my dad about everything and my dad saying they’re now welcome anytime at our house. 

the next morning they asked how i was doing and to remember to eat. i just replied neutrally and kept the same tone they had. the next few days they were just messaging me on single text every day: meds. i would just say thank you. they also removed hurtful reposts like

""imagine hurting me while i was saving for your birthday gift"" and ""i hope guilt eats you alive one quiet night at a time"", and even found reels where it was about forgiving the partner who cheated even if they don't deserve it and if they are forgiven, it's mercy. it gave me hope.

yesterday, i messaged them saying thank you and i added our pet name, and asked about my glasses. they did not reply and the whole night passed without any med reminders. i spiraled again and talked to their cousin. we talked about stuff like how BP told them we’re broken up, but i told their cousin that BP told their uncle that it is just something that can be talked about. then the cousin took back what they said and mentioned that’s how BP implied it so they just assumed. the exact wording BP used was it was “complicated, smth like that.” the cousin found out about it while they were drinking. 

now all i can do on social media is to fast scroll all the reels hoping i would come across what BP liked, and it’s all hurt posts. they also posted on their org page something about a finality that correlates with our current situation, along the lines of “let’s get back to school, not to them.” 

i am also afraid that i just severed our only contact which is BP messaging me every day about meds by calling them with our pet name + asking about my glasses, and maybe the cousin told them that we were messaging each other. it is making my brain tie knots harder and not knowing is eating me alive, and the fear of going no contact at all before our agreed date to talk and how BP might not show up on that day.",0,1769065234.0,SupportforWaywards,3,0.5,False

Prices often increase to cover curated interiors, while portions and taste don’t always improve, and long-standing local spots with excellent food but no visual appeal get overlooked online. Menus also seem to grow more generic, chasing trends instead of showcasing regional or family-style dishes. Some of the best meals I’ve had in Vietnam were at simple street stalls or small family-run places with no aesthetic focus at all, yet unforgettable flavors.

**Top On Self‑Care Meets Color Therapy 🎨🧠**

You know that feeling when you catch yourself doom‑scrolling at midnight, convincing yourself it’s “relaxing”... but somehow end up more stressed?  
Yeah. Been there. Too many tabs open. Both in Chrome *and* in my brain.

That’s when I rediscovered something beautifully simple — coloring.  
Not the kind from childhood, but designs crafted for *grown-up chaos*: intricate mandalas, soothing landscapes, and those oddly satisfying geometric patterns.

At first, it felt strange—to put down my phone and pick up pencils.  
But soon, that 10‑minute break became the calmest part of my entire day.  
No pressure to “be productive.” No judgment. Just quiet creativity.

Coloring as an adult does more than just fill pages — it rewires moments:
• It pulls your mind out of decision fatigue and into calm routine.  
• It’s mindfulness in disguise (you focus without *trying* to focus).  
• It’s therapy without awkward eye contact.

So, I decided to make something that helps others experience that same mental reset — a **coloring book adult PDF** collection designed for real life: quick sessions, desktop‑friendly, printable whenever you need a break.

👉 **Download your free copy here:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Whether you’re winding down after work, journaling, or sipping coffee at 7 AM before the noise starts — these pages invite you to slow down and breathe.

People have told me this small switch to mindful creativity changed how they manage stress (some even color before meetings now—power move, honestly).

If you’ve been craving peace, permission to play, or just five minutes away from *everything*, this might be your gentle cue.

👉 **Grab the free adult coloring book PDF now:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

And if you know someone who could use a mini reset between “Zoom fatigue” and “life overload,” share the link their way. Because sometimes, a splash of color does more than a motivational quote ever could.

I don't have much time/energy to cook after work (long hours) and gym, so I eat out almost every night. Dinner is the only time I eat carbs and I try to keep it to high protein food like burrito bowls, Vietnamese rice plate, Hawaiian bbq, etc. Unless I'm underestimating the calories of my dinner, I feel like I'm still at a deficit given the light day time meals.. thoughts?

There were only four other kids in my grade, and as someone who is gay and nonbinary, I never really fit in. When I began questioning my gender and later started transitioning, I was disowned by my biological family, which made an already isolating environment feel even more lonely.

After my junior year of high school, I realized how isolated I was and decided to enroll myself in my local public high school in hopes of making friends and improving my social skills. While I learned a lot from that experience and don’t regret it, I unfortunately was never really able to fully get into a friend group or form close friendships.

I’m now 20 and living about an hour away from where I grew up. On paper, my life is honestly pretty good. I have my dream job, I make a good amount of money, I live in a gorgeous apartment in a good town, and I live with my childhood best friend Anna, 19F, not her real name, who I met while I was being homeschooled. We also have two cats.

I live in a more rural part of Illinois, and my full time job is fairly isolated, so I don’t naturally meet people through work. Not to mention I work irregular hours.

My issue is that Anna is planning to move to Chicago in a few months. While I don’t personally agree with the choice, it’s going to happen regardless of my feelings, and I genuinely want her to make the most of this opportunity. What worries me is that Anna is very Type B and not great at staying in contact with people. At the same time, I don’t want her to feel like she has to stay in close contact with me out of obligation when I want her to enjoy this new chapter.

This has forced me to confront the fact that I don’t really have personal friends outside of her. I do have people in my life, coworkers, adoptive family, and people I talk to casually, but I don’t have anyone I can really vent to or just grab coffee with. I feel like this would be easier if I were in college, but I’m not, and I don’t have the need or plans to go.

I feel really stuck right now and honestly don’t know what to do next. I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how to make friends as a young adult outside of college, or how to cope with this kind of loneliness when your main support person is moving away.

Some things I’ve started to do are make my own coffee at home with compostable paper filters instead of going to Starbucks, carrying around a reusable water bottle, and starting an herb garden in my dorm kitchen. I also am line-drying all of my denim and sweaters to extend their life, and overall just forcing myself to wait a few days when I think I “need” something (90% of the time I just forget about it!)

I’m wondering if anyone else has any other tips, big or small, on ways to cut consumption! ",5,1769064527.0,Anticonsumption,3,0.86,False

for context: my mother has a cousin sister who was really good in studies like maths but as she grew up she got more into fashion and party stuff. because of this she ended up dropping her studies entirely saying she'll just become a housewife. now both her and her husband are unemployed living on their parent's money and she and her own sister blame their parents for this outcome. 

so now my mother thinks everytime I ask for permission to hang out with my female friends in a Cafe or smth in like every 1-2 months, I'm going on the same path as her cousin sister 

my mother literally lowk slutshames me saying if I'm going out like this I must be meeting boys (son I'm crin 😂😂👆) and how I would end up doing something wrong in these hangouts (mam I wanted to drink coffee with my old school friends and catch up to them in like 1-2 months)

I got into a new school this semester so literally ALL of my friends have become online friends but my parents think now that any of them is not in my school I should not talk to them as it's just a waste of time 

If they see me texting or calling my female friends I get yelled at for not focusing on my studies

Talking bout boys is a foreign concept in my parents reign but they stop me from talking to even female friends I highk crashout

Man I'm an extrovert I get depressed if I don't talk to a single friend in a day

In september I thought I would hangout with my friends after exams but my father deliberately parked my scooty somewhere idk and hide the keys saying my scooty is gone for servicing. I didn't got my scooty back until my exams got over and he admitted he hid the keys to stop me from going to school by my scooty because ig he knew i'll hangout with my friends 🥰🥰

Nowadays even asking to go my friends BIRTHDAY party has become a fucking hot topic in this home as according to them studious children don't attend birthday parties 

I'm literally in 11th its not like I have to give exams to get into a uni or smth and still I had to fight them to go to my best friend's bday party in November 

Now tomorrow is my another best friend's birthday and she literally invited me weeks ago, ofc I said yes 

today, a day before I told them I'll have to skip school tomorrow (I have like 85% attendance and course has already finished, all my copies are checked) they both like cornered me asking why so after a while I had to reluctantly told my mother that it's my best friend's bday and omg 

My mother literally crashed out bro was yelling and calling me names saying things like that's why I changed schools to have friendship like these 

She insulted my friend saying what kind of student asks to skip school for a bday party. bro was yelling how can I drop??!?! school for a bday party LIKE I WAS GIVING UP ON MY STUDIES OR SMTH 😭😭😭

she said that I can live in a home with convenience because my parents didn't get involved with friends like these and waste their time 

she outright denied that I won't be attending any bday party, I lowk started crying because man I do not deserve to go thru allat for asking to go to a fucking bday party BTW she got more mad seeing me cry 💔💔

And when I said 2 words to retort like how I was invited weeks ago she threatened to beat me up and said If my father get to know bout this he'll beat me up too like yeah ofc yahi toh bacha tha bs 😍😍🥰🥰

The thing is even times before this my father would say yes to hangout with my friends but my mother would gaslight him into disagreeing by saying non sense like this.",1,1769063881.0,TeenIndia,15,0.67,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I've been having my cappuccino (latte? i'm not sure, it has milk!) for a couple of days now and I notice that while it is warm, it's not hot...

I was wondering if there's anything I can do to make the drink just a bit warmer? Or is that going to kill the taste overall? Like if I make the espresso, then throw it in the microwave for 30sec, will that make the taste bitter or something? Or the milk or whatever?

My routine right now is-- get lactose-free whole milk from fridge, grab aeroccino and fill to bottom max line. Put on base, prepare my Nespresso with Altissio pod, click Nespresso and Aeroccino buttons at the same time. As soon as both are done, i pour the milk into the glass with the espresso inside, then scrape the Aeroccino for the leftover froth that's there.

The thing is, though, even trying to drink it right away, it's just kind of warm and not hot. Also, I've taken off the spring of the whisk to try and make it less frothy, but it's still too frothy for me. Any tips for that? I like the texture of a whipped milk, but not all the foam.

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the kicker: **you probably already have more than you realize**—you’re just not putting it to work the right way.

Most of us leave money sitting in savings accounts earning *peanuts* (like, literal pocket change) when it could be growing into something way bigger. Imagine if your coffee fund could one day pay for your coffee *and* your vacation. That’s the power of making your money work for you.

### **Where’s Your Money Hiding?**
- **The ""Just in Case"" Stash** – That emergency fund? Smart. But if it’s just sitting there, inflation’s eating it alive.
- **The ""I’ll Deal With It Later"" Pile** – Old 401(k)s, forgotten stocks, or that side hustle cash you haven’t invested.
- **The ""I Don’t Trust the Market"" Fear** – Spoiler: Not investing *is* a risk—especially when your savings could be outpacing inflation.

### **The Simple Fix?**
You don’t need to be a Wall Street genius. Just **start small, stay consistent, and let compounding do the heavy lifting**. Even an extra $100/month in the right place can turn into *serious* cash over time.

**Example:** If you stash $200/month in a high-growth account (averaging 7% return), in 20 years? **$100K+**. That’s not luck—that’s math.

I get coffee and drag it out a bit so to not run into him again and walk back where I came from, and I realize this is probably the hotel the Isles are staying at and that’s the team bus.

I scrambled out of there before I ran into anyone else. I figured I’d curse them with bad luck.
