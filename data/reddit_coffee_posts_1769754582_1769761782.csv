It’s my birthday tomorrow and I’m looking for a brunch spot to go to with my friend. I’d love something that is aesthetically pleasing and in a good location, has good food and drinks (good coffee and mimosas are a must) but isn’t too expensive. I’d ideally like to keep it under £150. I love any traditional breakfast dishes like eggs Benedict or breakfast bowls. 

I already looked into Duck and Waffle but they don’t have any available time slots for Saturday brunch. Anything similar to their vibe is what I’m looking for. 

What are your go-to recommendations? I’m open to spots that are walk-in or take reservations. I just want to make sure I can secure a table somewhere on a busy Saturday.",1,1769761690.0,LondonFood,0,1.0,False

i just wanted to share with everyone who has a hard time quitting.  
A co worker of mine was also sick and tired of coffee and so he said 'im done im drinking tea from now on'. That really helped ( i know im weak for not doing this on my own). This morning i drank 1 tea first with him and i was very calm even a bit drowsy i have to say. But of course 2 hours later i drank a coffee anyway (espresso). I have to say i feel insane, so much bad energy from this.   
If you didnt try this, give it a try.. not to keep going like that but to get a different perspective. 

Ill keep this rhythm going for a week and then introduce more and more tea and then give that up as well in the end. I think its a good way to make yourself aware of what it does to you in terms of anxiety and calmness. 

some of us have a hard time starting the process of quitting, so i thought maybe you should try this first as a first step.

I will say it’s not 100% accurate as I couldn’t figure out how to fill a shape with a gradient on Freeform on my phone, however it’s basically correct, I’m attracted to people presenting feminine regardless of their biological sex. I hope none of the terms I used are offensive to anyone (apologies if they are that’s not my intention, I’m very open to modifying terms used). The reason I went with gender presentation instead of gender identity is because I have found cis men attractive that are presenting as female, so its not down to a person’s gender identity (at least for me).

The reason I was talking about gradients is that I was thinking you could show levels of attraction by the intensity of the red, in which case mine would be red at the top fading out towards the biological sex line.

i want to preface this by saying that i love my girlfriend (21cisF) and that i do not intend to leave her, if your advice is just to leave then either don’t comment or at least have something else productive to add. 

we’ve been together for four years, and she knew very early on into our relationship that i was trans. i remember her using my preferred name often, both through text and over the phone — even in person (of course this is only ‘often’ because i lived with my unaware parents and we are in the south). she would do small stuff, giving my preferred name when ordering coffee, typing it for me when promoted in different situations, writing notes addressed to me, and the like. 

it seems like since we’ve been in college this has changed drastically. i’ve had many conversations (probably about four or five separate occasions) about how i would appreciate it if she would use my preferred name, even just in absolute privacy; and this works for a little bit, but it ends soon after. these small gesture moments are no longer but a memory, and the only times i can recall hearing my name or preferred pronouns are in intimate situations. 

i don’t know what to do. it feels like i’m going crazy, like the one person i trust the most doesn’t see me. i’ve said this all before but i don’t know how to get it to change. i love her so much and i know she loves me; we want to have a future together. she’s scared for many different reasons — her family eventually having to figure out, how our wedding will work, how my name will work, if i’ll be generally safe. but these are also all concerns that i have as well. 

we’re now a semester away from graduating, and i feel hopeless. i’ve already had to recently cut ties with my family and handle living on my own and supporting myself with little to no knowledge about how this world works because i grew up sheltered. if anyone has any advice, please do give me your words. i’m at the end of my rope.

1qqzh28,https://www.reddit.com/r/a1th0ughts/comments/1qqzh28/system_1_thinking_heuristics_automaticity/,"System 1 thinking - heuristics , automaticity","I'll search for analysis on which industries structurally depend on System 1 cognitive processing and why this correlates with business performance.

Yes. The most durable, high-margin industries structurally optimize for \*\*System 1 dominance\*\*—not merely as a marketing tactic, but as the fundamental architecture of their economic moats. When customers rely on heuristics, emotions, and habit rather than analysis, businesses capture \*\*cognitive rent\*\*: they monetize human cognitive laziness itself.



Here is the taxonomy of System 1-dependent industries and the specific mechanisms that create their durability:



\## 1. The Impulse-Consumption Complex

\*\*Industries\*\*: Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), convenience retail, vending machines, quick-service restaurants (QSR), energy drinks/snacking



\*\*System 1 Mechanism\*\*: \*\*Context-dependent automaticity\*\* with minimal deliberation

\- \*\*Physical salience\*\*: 95% of daily cognitive activity is System 1 . When standing in a supermarket aisle, the brain defaults to the brand with highest ""mental availability""—the one most easily recalled via packaging color, logo shape, or shelf position .

\- \*\*Price insensitivity through low stakes\*\*: A $3 purchase triggers no cortisol/financial anxiety response, bypassing the prefrontal cortex entirely. Customers literally ""grab the red package and leave in seconds"" .

\- \*\*Habit stacking\*\*: These products bind to existing ritual contexts (morning coffee, commute snacks), creating \*\*contextual monopolies\*\* where the product becomes the default for specific moments .



\## 2. The Neurochemical Arbitrage Sector

\*\*Industries\*\*: Alcohol, tobacco, caffeine/energy drinks, cannabis, gaming/gambling, social media/attention economy



\*\*System 1 Mechanism\*\*: \*\*Dopaminergic bypass of rational evaluation\*\*

\- \*\*Immediate gratification\*\*: These industries exploit the brain's mesolimbic pathway, where dopamine release during anticipation overrides long-term cost-benefit analysis (System 2) .

\- \*\*Variable ratio reinforcement\*\*: Slot machines and TikTok use the same Skinnerian schedules that make System 1 impossible to resist—the ""wanting"" system operates faster than the ""thinking"" system.

\- \*\*Withdrawal captivity\*\*: Physical dependence (nicotine, caffeine) or psychological habituation (social media FOMO) creates System 1 dominance through \*\*avoidance of negative affect\*\* rather than pursuit of pleasure.



\## 3. The Inertia Infrastructure

\*\*Industries\*\*: Subscriptions (SaaS, media streaming, gym memberships), utilities, telecommunications, insurance



\*\*System 1 Mechanism\*\*: \*\*Opt-out friction and default bias\*\*

\- \*\*Auto-renewal as cognitive tax\*\*: These businesses convert System 2 decisions (signing up) into System 1 maintenance (forgetting to cancel). The switching cost becomes cognitive effort—the need to engage System 2 to evaluate alternatives.

\- \*\*Hedonic adaptation\*\*: Consumers stop noticing recurring charges below a certain threshold ($10-20/month), treating them as background noise rather than active expenses. This exploits System 1's WYSIATI principle (""what you see is all there is"")—the absence of the bill in immediate awareness means it doesn't trigger evaluation .



\## 4. The Emotional Resonance Cartel

\*\*Industries\*\*: Luxury fashion, fragrances, ""lifestyle"" automotive (Harley-Davidson, certain luxury brands), cult-status consumer tech (Apple)



\*\*System 1 Mechanism\*\*: \*\*Affect heuristic and identity fusion\*\*

\- \*\*Emotion as decision shortcut\*\*: These brands create such powerful emotional resonance that they become the ""no-brainer choice"" despite inflated prices. System 2 ""often doesn't even get a look in"" .

\- \*\*Identity substitution\*\*: The purchase becomes an expression of self-concept rather than functional evaluation. System 1 handles self-image protection; System 2 analysis would threaten the ego-investment.

\- \*\*Cognitive closure\*\*: Need for cognitive closure drives impulsive decisions, especially when branding triggers feelings of security or status .



\## 5. The Amygdala Hijack Industries

\*\*Industries\*\*: Insurance, cybersecurity, residential security, pharmaceutical marketing (direct-to-consumer), financial trading apps



\*\*System 1 Mechanism\*\*: \*\*Fear-based cortisol activation\*\*

\- \*\*Loss aversion override\*\*: These industries trigger the amygdala's threat-detection circuits, causing rapid System 1 action (buying insurance, panic-selling stocks) that overrides probability analysis.

\- \*\*Asymmetric information exploitation\*\*: When customers activate System 2, they might realize the product is poor value (low-loss probability insurance) or harmful (high-fee trading apps). Therefore, these industries optimize for \*\*System 1 urgency\*\*—""limited time offers,"" ""your data is at risk,"" ""act now"" messaging that prevents analytical engagement.



\## 6. The Cognitive Offloading Services

\*\*Industries\*\*: Ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft), food delivery, one-click e-commerce (Amazon), ""buy now pay later"" (BNPL)



\*\*System 1 Mechanism\*\*: \*\*Elimination of deliberation points\*\*

\- \*\*Default pathway construction\*\*: These businesses convert inherently System 2 decisions (planning transport, budgeting, comparison shopping) into frictionless System 1 reflexes.

\- \*\*Delayed pain\*\*: By separating consumption from payment (BNPL, ride-sharing), they prevent the cortisol spike that normally triggers System 2 evaluation of cost versus value.



\---



\## The durability mathematics



System 1 dependence creates superior business durability because:



1. \*\*CAC Compression\*\*: No research phase means no comparison shopping. The customer acquisition cost is spent on \*\*brand salience\*\* (colors, slogans, shelf space) rather than feature differentiation.

2. \*\*Retention through inertia\*\*: Switching requires engaging System 2 to evaluate alternatives—a cognitive effort cost that exceeds the benefit for low-stakes decisions.

3. \*\*Pricing power\*\*: System 1 decisions rely on the \*\*affect heuristic\*\*—if it feels good/familiar, it is assumed to be valuable. This allows price increases to pass with minimal churn, whereas System 2 buyers would recalculate value propositions .

4. \*\*Defensibility through data density\*\*: High-frequency System 1 interactions generate the ""feedback loops"" that create AI-era moats—data advantages that compound with every automatic transaction .



\---



\## The exceptions that prove the rule



Some durable industries rely on System 2 but achieve durability through alternative mechanisms:



| Industry | System 2 Dependence | Durability Mechanism |

|----------|---------------------|---------------------|

| \*\*Enterprise Software\*\* | High deliberation (CFO analysis) | \*\*Switching costs\*\* and data lock-in create inertia despite initial System 2 evaluation |

| \*\*Luxury Real Estate/Collectibles\*\* | Extensive analysis | \*\*Veblen goods\*\* where System 2 deliberation itself becomes part of the status signaling |

| \*\*Industrial B2B\*\* | Rational procurement processes | \*\*Relationship capital\*\* and certification barriers create friction to switching |

| \*\*Professional Services\*\* (law, consulting) | Rational selection | \*\*Asymmetric expertise\*\* creates agency capture; client delegates System 2 to vendor |



\## The Synthetic Convergence



The most powerful modern businesses \*\*convert System 2 into System 1\*\*:

\- \*\*Amazon\*\*: Makes comparison shopping (System 2) obsolete through 1-Click and ""recommended for you"" (System 1).

\- \*\*Apple\*\*: Converts phone purchase (high deliberation) into ecosystem lock-in where accessory purchases become automatic.

\- \*\*Credit Cards\*\*: Abstract away the pain of payment (System 2 evaluation of affordability) into seamless System 1 spending.



\*\*Conclusion\*\*: The ""best"" businesses—defined by margin durability, pricing power, and low churn—are those that remove the need for thought itself. They don't win on features; they win on \*\*cognitive ease\*\*, occupying the neural pathways of effortless decision. As Kahneman observed, while System 2 believes it is ""where the action is,"" it is System 1 that generates the intuitive impulses forming the basis of millions of unconscious judgments daily .",1,1769760236.0,a1th0ughts,0,1.0,False

And yet, despite all that activity, I felt completely invisible, not in the usual “I’m shy” way, but in a way that made the world feel distant, like I was standing behind glass, unable to touch or be touched.

It wasn’t that I disliked people. I didn’t. I wanted to be part of the world around me, but it felt impossible. My mind kept spinning with thoughts I couldn’t organize: memories I hadn’t processed, worries I didn’t know how to face, small regrets I carried like loose coins in my pocket. Every smile around me felt like it belonged to someone else’s life, not mine.

At one point, I closed my eyes briefly, just to escape, to pretend the noise wasn’t there. I focused on my breath, the shallow, uneven rhythm I had been ignoring for hours. I tried to breathe slower, deeper, to anchor myself, but even that felt fragile, like holding onto smoke.

When I finally reopened my eyes, nothing outside had changed. The café was still full, the conversations continued, the sun shifted slightly across the table in front of me. And yet something inside me had shifted. I can’t describe it fully; it was like a light had switched on in a dark room I didn’t even realize I was in. My chest felt strangely expansive, almost physically so, and my heartbeat settled into a rhythm that felt deliberate and attentive, as if it were telling me, You exist. You matter. You are here.

It took me a few minutes to even register what was happening. I felt tears prick at the edges of my eyes, unbidden, and I didn’t wipe them away. They weren’t sad tears, and they weren’t joyful either. They were recognition, an acknowledgment that I had been carrying invisible weight and that, for a brief moment, it had been lifted.

Later, I thought back to a Bhakti Marga meditation I had attended months before. At the time, it hadn’t left much impression. I had gone out of curiosity more than devotion, and I had left without feeling anything extraordinary. But now I understood: the calm presence of that room, the soft focus of those meditating, the quiet steadiness in the air, they had left a trace in me. It had been dormant, like a seed buried under concrete, and that day, for reasons I couldn’t explain, it sprouted.

Over the next few weeks, I noticed subtle changes. A stranger’s smile felt warmer, less like a fleeting motion and more like an acknowledgment I could feel in my chest. Conversations no longer seemed like a performance or a test; I could listen without trying to respond perfectly. Silence stopped feeling threatening; it became a space I could inhabit without fear. I began writing again, not to impress anyone, not even to analyze myself, but because it felt good to have words flow onto paper, simple and unfiltered.

It wasn’t a dramatic change. My life didn’t suddenly feel perfect or complete. But something small inside me had opened. Something I had ignored or resisted for years had begun to breathe. And I carry that memory with me now as a quiet reminder that presence, both inside and around us, can arrive unexpectedly, and that when we notice it, it can quietly change the way we feel about ourselves and the world.🙌",3,1769759772.0,Divinepath,8,1.0,False

And yes, making money on this is a goal but if it helps any number of people, my conscious is clear.

Why $2? Because it's cheap enough to be an impulse buy and expensive enough to be more disciplined and if you aren’t willing to trade the price of a cheap coffee for your discipline, you aren't ready to quit. The $2 is ""skin in the game."" I believe it makes the commitment real.

What’s inside:

*     The Override: A massive emergency button. One click gives you a high-friction distraction (random wiki, reddit links, physical tasks, advices) to snap your brain out of the urge.
* A big counter to display the length of your current streak with a ""I GAVE IN"" button

He met my mom. We ran errands together for one household. He told me he loved me only once, yet on a daily basis we had what looked like a beautiful relationship. He does little actions for me (drives me to airport, cooks for me, makes me juices, gives me back rubs, helps put away dishes, amazing sex etc).

Last weekend I was ten minutes late for a walk we were supposed ro go on.  his back hurt. He screamed at me, saying he didn’t care if I disappeared and that he didn’t need me, among other atrocious things. He never apologized. The tension was so thick in the car i almost got out at the red light but chose not to.  I did try explaining to him that I did not intentionally make him wait.. i just untangled my hair after a shower and did not do makeup just got dressed and that was it. He assumed i made phone calls.. i didn’t.

When I asked for accountability for his words that evening, he slammed the racks of his oven again and again for ten minutes yelling in frustration. He made me carrot juice and ravioli and hoped I would forgive him once again, but I couldn’t without a real apology. I was hurt. That night he slept at his own place. (He has been sleeping at mine for almost two years).

A week went by in silence. Usually we talk ten times a day. He would only tell me if he got home at night (I hadn’t asked). Maybe he was trying to maintain normalcy. I sent him a message saying I needed a sign that he loved me, because all the beautiful moments of living together, mixed with cold and hurtful words and this abrupt separation, has left me completely confused.

He finally worked up the courage to come to my place. While he was outside, I screamed in fear because I saw a bug. There was no way it could have sounded like anything else. Instead of banging on the door or calling me — because I didn’t hear him knock in my panic — he chose to message me that he hoped “he didn’t invade me,” insinuating it wasn’t a bug.

That made me even more upset. I am loyal, I love him, and I have asked him to choose me — to voice it. Instead, he questioned my integrity. I asked him to come back to my place a few times (hoping we could finally discuss all this behavior) but he refused.

That sunday: he disappeared . No news. Weekends are really the only days we can fix things because he works hard in the week.

Two days later, we ran into each other by accident in the building where we both live. He later texted me:

“I forgot to ask you last night, you looked very elegant in your outfit. Were you going on a date, or were you coming back from one?”

I was devastated and insulted. Not only was I not chosen — I was accused. How could I be dating someone two weeks after an argument with no apology and no closure when I sent him an email telling him I love him and need to understand all his recent borderline abusive words.

My heart was still waiting.

I responded, asking him, “Is this how you compliment me?” I told him I could never date someone when my heart still had him in it. He replied, “I was not accusing, I was asking. Good night.” He was not asking since it was either i went before or after (assuming I had not was not even an option!)

It is incredibly hurtful to be told this when we basically have talked about moving in together and we basically already live together on the daily. How and why would i go date someone in less than two weeks of us having this issue!?!

I should add that in two years, he has never apologized once, though he has made extreme accusations. For example, he once asked why I washed my sheets when we weren’t intimate and said maybe i had a day visitor when he was at work. He also questioned why my car was dry when it had rained, implying I “must have had a visitor » (since i didn’t leave the house..) He believes that if I go to a coffee shop, it’s for reasons other than job hunting. He constantly implies things that are completely untrue.

I have always allowed him to make things better through acts of love, but he never apologizes.

I should also add the good: when things are good, we always enjoy each other’s company. We have fantastic intimacy. He cooks, helps put things away, gives me massages. We enjoy our nights and weekends together for the most part. But he rarely tells me I look good — except tonight, when he was accusing me.

I def do not feel loved or appreciated in the bad moments. In all the good ones i feel extra wonderful..  - thats why i’ve stayed and i do love him… but where i feel completely deprived is the NO communication when things go wrong.. we can never talk about it without him freaking out.. and if he lashes out randomly there is never an apology. I could be crying in his face and deeply hurt and he doesnt see me.. he will make me fresh carrot juice or dinner or want to give me a foot massage but it never goes beyond that to an adult level of im sorry i hurt you and ill try avoiding it in future so i feel completely neglected like my needs dont matter.. AND he is controlling: constantly tells me not to take photos for example.. or not pull out my phone (stupid things like that).. i just take deep breaths.. for example on new years he was on his phone and i finally pulled out mind and he goes « you dont have a son why are you on ur phone ! » … but i have parents …

1qqz4vf,https://i.redd.it/svuq2le0yfgg1.jpeg,When Trouble Walked In,"Chapter 01: When Trouble Walked In
ELLIE

I think being the only single person in a group of friends made up entirely of happy couples who have a lot of sex was affecting me, making me think it was time to find the right guy.

Not that I was really looking; I’d just promised myself not to go out with any more bastards or womanizers after everything I’d been through.

But that’s when the problem started—or rather, that’s when the problem walked through the door.

Ben’s younger brother, Ethan, walked into Zoe and Ben’s apartment during one of our gatherings, which involved drinking a lot of alcohol and catching up.

I hadn’t heard much about him. All I knew was that he ran the London office and was returning. Anna should have told me he was... \*like that.\*

Just by looking at him, I’d say he was the kind of guy I called a Wolf Charming. That was my antithesis to Prince Charming, who, in my mind, was what I didn’t want but probably should want. But I always thought Prince Charmings were too perfect and, consequently, boring.

The Wolf Charming was my ideal type—the kind who has wild sex with you and takes you roughly, but who has that charming side and treats you like a princess the rest of the time.

That was the impression the tall, broad-shouldered man with dark blonde hair gave me when he walked into the room, dressed in a suit on a Saturday. He looked too elegant and at the same time fierce and virile.

“Wolf Charming?” I whispered to Anna as we moved closer to greet him with the rest of the group.

Anna, my best friend, was probably the main reason I had this idea of finding the right guy stuck in my head.

Not that she had told me to do it, but simply because she was married to Will, the hottest and sexiest tattooed ex-player and nerd I had ever met. They were perfect together.

I was still trying to convince the two of them to donate some of Will’s DNA, so I could clone him in a lab. I always say it’s unfair that there’s only one Will. Anna hit the jackpot, and of course, so did Will.

“Bastard Charming, from what I’ve heard from Will,” she whispered back.

My smile faded instantly. Not that I judged before getting to know someone—I didn’t do that; I hated stereotypes and typification as a good scientist should—but hearing that would put any smart woman on guard.

In recent months, I’d worked hard to stay away from any womanizers, bastards, and players in New York.

Swallowing the last sip of beer, I leaned forward, placing the bottle on the coffee table before it was my turn to greet the man with striking light brown eyes. He was a good twenty centimeters taller than me, even in heels.

My stomach churned as I forced a smile in response to his, which revealed perfect teeth.

\*Damn... he’s fucking gorgeous.\*

I blinked, trying to snap out of the trance.

“Nice to meet you, Ethan. I’m Ellie. Welcome back to New York,” I said, offering my hand while my heart pounded in my chest.

I ignored that, along with the shiver that ran down my spine. Maybe it was because everyone around us was staring with some strange expectation, as if something screamed, two single people in the room, not just me as always.

“Nice to meet you, Ellie.” He shook my hand firmly.

I tried to ignore the quick once-over he gave me, spending way too much time focusing on my breasts. I pulled back as soon as he let go of my hand.

Ben, Will, and Jack gathered on the sofas after Ethan’s arrival, and I pulled Anna into the kitchen for another drink.

“His eyes are just like Ben’s,” she commented.

Yeah, those brown eyes were hypnotic.

“So is the reputation, I mean, before he married Zoe,” I said, making us both laugh. “But don’t let her know I brought that up. She’d eat me alive.”

Zoe and Bennett, or simply Ben, were another couple in my group of friends who were probably influencing me, though I think in a slightly \*different\* way than Anna and Will.

That’s because both of them were assholes who fell in love before they could kill each other. I don’t know how they’re still alive, maybe because they took out all their anger on each other through sex.

“He checked out your boobs,” Anna said as we entered the kitchen.

Stifling a laugh, she leaned against the island while I got busy opening two beers.

“You managed to notice that? I thought it was in a split second.”

“I think everyone noticed.”

“Ugh! Why was everyone staring?”

“Maybe because you’re the only singles in the room? That makes it interesting to watch when you’re married.”

“Do you really need to remind me? And it’s not like anything’s going to happen between us.”

“I know, I know. No scumbags, bastards, or womanizers. I’ve been hearing that for over a year now?”

“And you’ll keep hearing it until I find the right guy.” I handed her one of the beer bottles.

“To the right guy! May he show up soon!” She raised her bottle, proposing a toast, forcing me to do the same. “And end your bad mood with lots of sex!” she concluded.

“Hey! What bad mood?”

“Excuse me!” The deep voice sounded before he entered the kitchen.

His presence alone was enough to make me uncomfortable.

“Mind if I find Ben’s wine stash?” he asked, making Anna turn to face him.

“I’ll help you,” she offered, guiding him to the wall-mounted wine rack behind me.

I took a long sip of my beer, getting lost in my own thoughts as they discussed wines behind me.

“What do you Morgans take? I know Bennett goes to the gym almost every day, but nothing justifies you growing that much, not just in height,” Anna suddenly said, nearly making me spit out my beer.

God! She, as always, with no filter. I heard him let out a low laugh.

“You’re the scientist, right? Then you can explain genetics.”

“I think there are some things that even scientists like us can’t explain, right, El?” she said, forcing me to turn to them.

“Of course! Whatever you’re talking about, I’m with you.”

“So, you’re also a scientist?” He raised an eyebrow at me.

“Yes, more of a researcher these days.”

“I admit, I had a very different image of scientists in mind,” he said, not bothering to hide the way his eyes moved over my body, leaving me uneasy.

Chapter 02: Is That a No?
ELLIE

\*Shit, Ellie, focus.\* He’s definitely not the right guy; he’s more like the completely wrong guy.

I blinked, trying to remember what he had just said.

“Let me guess... White lab coat, glasses, test tubes, and a total nerd?” I raised an eyebrow.

He nodded.

“Something like that.”

“Don’t be fooled. We spend ninety percent of the time dressed exactly like that,” Anna said. “But even now, the nerdiness remains.”

That’s right. That’s my girl.

“You just forgot to mention that we wear high heels,” I added, winking at her.

Ethan sighed.

“That’s the closest you got to making the image of a scientist sexy. Well, thanks for the help, Anna. Finish what you’re doing and join us; it’ll be the first time I’ve had the chance to talk nonsense in front of two scientists,” he said before leaving.

“What the hell was that?” I asked, frowning.

“What?”

“‘What do you take?’”

“It was just curiosity. The man is... huge!”

“As if that’s uncommon and Will isn’t just as big or bigger.”

“Well, Will is... Will.” She shrugged.

“Great argument.”

“What I mean is that Will works out a lot and runs regularly.”

“What I mean is that your question sounded like flirting. It’s obvious he spends a lot of time at the gym.”

“I’m married; it couldn’t have sounded like flirting.”

“You’re terrible!” I laughed.

“I was just trying to be nice.”

“I get it. Where were we?”

“I think we were praying for your ideal guy to show up so you can have lots of sex?”

“You make me sound desperate.”

“I know you’re not. But you really do need to get laid.”

“Just because you have sex every day doesn’t mean everyone else has to. People do other... things.”

“You don’t have to do it every day, at least once a month, but never once a year.”

“What are you getting at?”

“You tell me... How long has it been?”

“That’s enough.”

\*A year? Maybe more. It was with that lawyer I met through work. He was hot but too busy. A shame.\*

“You’re trying to remember, aren’t you?”

“This conversation is over. My sex life isn’t important when all the available men are bastards.”

“Don’t forget Will and Ben’s past. I don’t forget. So there’s still hope. Sometimes a bastard just needs to discover love.”

“Thanks, but I don’t want to be the reason any bastard changes. And Will and Ben were always good men. Sleeping with lots of people doesn’t make you a bastard. Only when you lie and deceive.”

“I wouldn’t bet on them,” she said, surprising me.

“We’re talking about your husband.”

“I know.”

I blinked, considering it for a moment.

“Come to think of it... neither would I,” I agreed, making us burst into laughter.

“He checked out your ass,” she said when we stopped laughing, making me frown in confusion.

“Huh?”

“Twice, and he lingered the second time when he thought I wasn’t looking.”

“What are you trying to say?”

“He was analyzing you, first your boobs, and now your ass. I’d say he liked it.”

“Why are we still talking about this? The guy has a history.”

“He’s hot. And maybe... if you just wanted to...”

“Don’t continue. I’m not interested in anything superficial. I think I have to repeat...”

“Okay, okay. No bastards, womanizers, or players.”

“Great.”

“But why not have some fun until you find the right guy?”

I sighed. She knew why.

“I’m never letting anyone use me just for sex again. I respect that there are people who enjoy that, but it doesn’t work for me anymore. You know what happened last time.”

“Seven months wasted with a guy who couldn’t be honest with you and didn’t have the guts to say he wasn’t interested in anything more than sex, while you fell deeper and deeper for him.”

“Yeah. I wasted my time. So, enough of this topic.”

“Okay. Sorry.”

\*

It was past ten. It was time to leave. Jack and Zara were already heading out. They were another one of my couples of friends.

What to say about the two of them? Eccentric? Overly romantic? They made my heart warm just watching them. The way Jack treated Zara as the object of all his dedication and affection.

There were also two more couples I saw less often but loved just as much. The most recent of all, Anna’s brother, Jason, and his English girlfriend, Phillipa. And Jack’s brother, Neil, and his also English girlfriend, Rosie, who was a friend of Phillipa.

It was really hard not to feel a little envious of each of these couples' stories, being the only single one in the group. And maybe that’s why I was starting to feel like I was stranded at twenty-seven.

Poking Anna on the couch, I pointed to the empty beer bottles that had accumulated on the coffee table.

“Let’s take them to the kitchen,” I suggested.

“Don’t bother,” Zoe said, slightly tipsy from the drinks, leaning against her husband’s chest on the couch in front of us.

""Don’t worry, we’ll take care of it,"" Ben added.

""Don’t be so nice. We already know you’re not that nice in reality,"" I said, making everyone laugh.

""I’ll help you,"" Ethan said, standing up. ""Anna can focus on figuring out how to get Will home,"" he teased.

I nodded, getting up as well.

""I’m fine. You’ll see that during our run tomorrow,"" Will said, grinning as he pulled Anna closer. ""I’ve still got plenty of energy to burn tonight,"" he insinuated.

""Oh, God!"" I muttered, picking up four bottles, two in each hand.

Zoe and Ben laughed as I headed to the kitchen, hearing Ethan walk behind me, making me uncomfortable.

I really didn’t want to witness the foreplay of two couples.

""Are you sure it’s a good idea to go running with Will tomorrow? The man’s a machine,"" I tried to make conversation, attempting to avoid an awkward silence as I placed the bottles on the kitchen island.

""It wouldn’t be the first time. I’ve known Will for a long time. We’ve done a lot of runs in London during his visits.""

""Of course. You also think it’s normal to wake up before ten on a Sunday to work out. How could I not have noticed?"" I said, sarcastically.

""Don’t you like exercising? I mean... you seem pretty fit to me.""

I tried to ignore the idea that this might be flirting.

""Thanks. I go to the gym whenever work allows. But waking up at seven on a Sunday? I’ll pass,"" I said, turning to look at him, meeting his eyes for the first time since I shook his hand.

Bad idea. The man had a perfect face that made me feel awkward. His jaw seemed to have been sculpted by the gods themselves.

Looking away, I busied myself organizing the bottles he placed on the island, lining them up with mine.

""I see. So, you don’t mind a bit of cardio after ten?"" he asked.

""I guess so.""

""Great, because it’s almost eleven.""

""What?"" I looked up at him, not understanding.

""Looks like we’re the only ones here who won’t be having sex tonight.""

""I think I got lost at the part about cardio after ten, but you’ll get used to it. It’s just part of having only married friends.""

""You really didn’t get what I meant?"" A mischievous smile appeared on his face.

""Should I have? Maybe it’s the alcohol.""

""You said you don’t mind doing cardio after ten... It’s almost eleven, and I have an idea for some cardio we could do together,"" he articulated, making me blink.

""Wait... are you? Did you just meet me and are doing what I think you’re doing?""

""Is that a no?"" He raised an eyebrow.

Chapter 03: What a Bastard!
\*\*Chapter 03: What a Bastard!\*\*
ELLIE

God! What a bastard! He had to be joking.

“Of course, it's a no! Absolutely not.” I declared, feeling a mix of anger and frustration. “Good night!” I snarled, rolling my eyes as I walked past him.

What an asshole.

Back in the living room, I grabbed my bag from a side table.

“I’m leaving. Thanks for tonight. Love you guys,” I said, heading towards the door.

“Is everything okay?” Anna asked, standing up.

I turned, seeing Ethan return from the kitchen.

“Of course, see you tomorrow.” I forced a smile at the group sitting on the couch before heading out the door.

✽

I woke up around eight, much earlier than planned. I really hated waking up before ten on a Sunday. The thought reminded me of the conversation with the bastard last night.

The asshole had the nerve to ask me to have sex after two minutes of conversation. Unbelievable! All that beauty with character would be asking too much, Ellie. What a shame...

Still in bed, I sent a message to Anna, asking if she was still asleep. She replied right away, inviting me for breakfast. I remembered that Will was probably out running with the bastard. I really didn’t want to run into him.

After getting up, I took a shower and dressed for the late winter cold.

Anna lived just a few blocks away, which allowed me to walk over and visit her whenever possible. She had only been married for two years and had picked out the apartment with Will. I was extremely happy to have my best friend living nearby.

She opened the door as soon as I knocked, wearing a sweatsuit.

“It’s fucking cold out there, isn’t it?” She asked, taking my coat.

After hanging it up, she came back to hug me.

“You have no idea.”

“Will’s crazy to run during winter mornings.”

“And yet you still married him.”

“What’s a little craziness compared to those rock-hard abs?” She winked.

“You’re right, as always.”

“I’ll get the hot chocolate. Want cookies or something else?”

“Cake?”

“Yes. Chocolate? Will made a delicious one yesterday morning.”

“Please! Besides the rock-hard abs, the man cooks! God! Who do I need to make a deal with to get one of those?” I threw myself onto the couch, crossing one leg over the other. She laughed from the adjoining kitchen while preparing a tray. “This apartment seems more beautiful every time I come here.”

“Thank you. Here you go.” She said, placing the tray between us on the couch. “Now tell me why you ran out last night. We tried to get it out of Ethan, but he said nothing happened, and I know that’s a lie, I saw the way you looked at him before you left.”

“He just thought it was a good idea to ask me to have sex after two minutes of conversation.”

“He said he wanted to have sex with you?” She widened her eyes.

“It seemed to me that he had nothing better to do and thought I was available.”

“Or he thought you were hot and really wanted to have sex with you. Didn’t you think about accepting for even a second?”

“What? Of course not.”

I really hadn’t thought about it. Even though he was one of the most attractive men I’d ever met.

“You know... the man is...”

“A complete asshole!”

“Very hot.”

“Anna!” I scolded her.

“He is, but I know that’s not what you’re looking for.”

“I’m not looking for anything, I just know what I don’t want.”

“I know. I know. But it’s hard to believe you didn’t consider the idea for a second.”

“No. Not for a second. He was a complete jerk, he knows nothing about me.”

“You don’t find him attractive?”

Damn, she was making me think about him, something I was trying to avoid at all costs, but the image was quite clear in my mind.

“Why are you asking that when I’m telling you he acted like a bastard?”

“If he had made the offer after getting to know you better, would you have thought about accepting it?”

“That’s out of the question.”

“I see. You do find him very attractive.”

“This is ridiculous! Let’s change the subject.”

✽

I turned the corner and almost turned back if Will hadn’t spotted me as soon as I took a step. They were coming back from their run, dressed in heavy sweats and beanies.

Shit. \*Be polite, it’s simple.\*

“Looks like my wife’s already up,” Will said, stopping in front of me on the sidewalk before hugging me, making me stretch. “Good morning, El.”

“Good morning. We had breakfast together. Your cake was delicious.”

“Glad you liked it. I’ll make one, especially for you. I think I managed to teach Ethan a lesson at least.”

“What? I’m fine.” Ethan said from behind Will.

I ignored his presence as long as I could, but I had to face him and force a smile.

“Good morning,” I murmured.

“Good morning, Ellie.”

“Well, I’ve got to go. See you later, Will.”

I kept walking, leaving them behind. But I only managed to take a few more steps before hearing Ethan call my name.

I stopped, taking a deep breath before turning around. Just looking at his perfect face was enough to irritate me.

He was tall in a way that made me have to tilt my head up, and that only irritated me more.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“I almost believed everything was fine a minute ago. Ever thought about acting?”

He was wearing a black beanie that highlighted his square jaw.

“Do you have something to say to me, or are you just trying to annoy me?”

“Wow... Are you always this receptive?” His hands sank into his pockets.

“Only with assholes.”

“You’re pretty high-strung for a scientist.”

“Say what you want.”

“It seems you might have gotten a bad first impression of me.”

“Really? Why would you think that?” I said, using the maximum amount of sarcasm I could muster.

“Funny. What I mean is, that I didn’t mean to offend you with the invitation yesterday. Quite the opposite.”

“You didn’t offend me.”

“It didn’t seem that way.” He raised an eyebrow, skeptical. “Bennett told me it was a bad idea... but I accidentally overheard your friend saying you needed to get laid. So...”

“You were eavesdropping?”

""I was coming in and asked for permission right after. You said you weren’t offended, but you’re clearly upset with me.”

“What you did tells me about the kind of guy you are; it has nothing to do with me.”

“What kind of guy am I?”

“The kind I want to stay away from. Let’s do this... I’ll treat you politely because you’re Bennett’s brother, and because of that, we’ll probably run into each other around here. But that’s it. Have a nice life.” I turned to leave, but he kept talking.

“You’ve never had sex with someone you just met? Because I think you’re overreacting.”

“Forget it. You’re only managing to be an even bigger asshole.”

He kept following me.

“It was just an invitation for sex. You’re the one being crazy.”

“Forget it. Don’t you get it?” I turned back to him again.

“I was just trying to apologize.”

“For what? Do you think you did something wrong?”

“No. As I said, I didn’t mean to offend you.”

“You didn’t. So stop apologizing since you don’t feel guilty.”

“You’re still mad, and I don’t know why. I want to avoid conflicts since I just got back.”

You should have thought about that yesterday, asshole.

“There won’t be any conflict from my side.”

“Great.”

“Great. Goodbye!”

I walked away, leaving him behind.

✽

We had planned to have lunch together on Tuesday. When Anna and I arrived at the bar, Zoe and Ben were already waiting with Will, seated at a table in the corner.

Anna leaned in to kiss Will without any hesitation as we approached. I greeted everyone with a general “hi.”

“Is everything okay, El?” Will asked after a few minutes, noticing my silence while they chatted.

My mood was terrible this week, probably PMS.

“Just a headache.”

“Maybe my gift will help with that,” Zoe said, bending down and coming back up with two Victoria’s Secret bags.

She handed one to Anna and the other to me.

“It’s not my birthday or anything...” Anna said, confused as she opened the bag. “But thanks.” She pulled out the box and set it on the table as I thanked her.

“Wow! It’s... pink,” Anna said after opening the box and unwrapping a tiny pink lace lingerie set.

It barely covered any skin. Zoe laughed from the other side of the table. Will had a mischievous smile, and Bennett shook his head in disapproval, he did that a lot. Partly because he was grumpy, and partly because he disapproved of this kind of nonsense.

“That color really captures my personality,” Anna mocked as Will held up the pieces to inspect them.

“I think Will likes the gift more than you do,” Zoe said, laughing. “But what about you, Ellie? Aren’t you going to open yours?”

“I think this kind of gift makes perfect sense for Anna... But in my case, it’ll probably end up being eaten by moths in my closet.” I placed the box on the table.

“Shit...” Bennett muttered, making us all turn to look in the direction he was facing, at the restaurant entrance.

\*Great.\* Ethan was coming our way.

Chapter 04: You started this
\*\*Chapter 04: You started this\*\*
ELLIE

Who invited him? My eyes almost automatically rolled at the sight of him.

He was wearing a black suit that made him look absurdly hot, and his hair was slicked back, with rebellious strands falling onto his forehead.

His appearance gave off an air of arrogance. Why did it always seem like he’d shaved the day before and now had that almost invisible stubble, making him even sexier?

Damn. \*It’s just hormones, Ellie. It’s just hormones.\* His presence magically made me more aware of my own body.

“Am I interrupting?” He approached, kissing Zoe on the cheek. “Hey, sis-in-law!”

“Bennett said you weren’t coming,” she said.

“Oh yeah?” I noticed a quick exchange of glances between the two.

Something was there.

“I changed my mind.” He smiled at Ben. “What did I interrupt?”

“Have a seat. We’re waiting for our orders. You can still make yours.” Will pointed to an empty chair at the end, next to Anna, directly across from me.

“Ellie was just about to open the gift I gave her,” Zoe gestured for me to continue, giving me a wink.

The embarrassment hit me, opening that in front of them, whatever it was, would make them all imagine me wearing it. \*It would make Ethan imagine me wearing it.\*

“I can look at it later. Thank you so much for the gift.”

“No... I want to see your reaction. Please?” Zoe asked.

“Yeah, Ellie... open it,” Anna encouraged with an almost smile.

I gave her a disapproving look before giving in.

“Okay.”

I opened the box as if there was a bomb inside. I unwrapped some paper before pulling out a black lingerie set, complete with a bra, panties, and sheer stockings.

Eventually, my eyes moved from the lingerie to Ethan’s face, which was directly in my line of sight. I could almost swear I saw him shift in his chair. Then I knew he was imagining me in it.

My face must have been red as I stuffed the pieces back into the box.

“Um... thanks, Zoe. I love it... though the moths will probably get more use out of it.”

“Moths?” Ethan asked, confused, his eyebrows furrowed.

“Ellie thinks she won’t use the gift. But I say that reaction alone was worth it,” Zoe smiled, satisfied.

“We all know why,” Ethan murmured from across the table with a sarcastic smile.

“What did you say?” I asked.

“Ethan... fuck,” Bennett muttered through gritted teeth.

“Just kidding,” he softened.

“Just because I won’t wear it with you... doesn’t mean I can’t wear it with someone less of a bastard.” I retorted with a smile. “Just kidding.” I teased, making everyone at the table stifle their laughter.

Except for Ben, who seemed to disapprove, shaking his head again.

“That’s enough. Where’s the food?” Bennett looked towards the restaurant kitchen.

“I think I get it,” Will said with a smile, looking between me and Ethan.

I narrowed my eyes at him, and he shrugged.

A few minutes later, the waitress brought our orders. I tried to ignore how exaggeratedly Ethan smiled at her while placing his order. Asshole, couldn’t see a pair of boobs.

The conversation shifted to work as we ate. When his order arrived, I couldn’t help but notice the slip of paper discreetly handed to him, which probably contained the waitress's phone number.

It seems not everyone was avoiding the bastards of Manhattan or had trouble having sex after a few exchanged smiles. Watching the scene made me nauseous.

He made me feel weird, and he’d called me crazy. Can you believe it?

“Did you guys know that more than a million new cases of four sexually transmitted infections are contracted every day? Isn’t that scary? That adds up to more than 376 million new cases annually. On average, one in every twenty-five people in the world has at least one of these four STIs,” I said, looking at my plate.

When I looked up, everyone was staring at me with strange or surprised expressions.

“What?” I asked.

“Well, in any case, I’m glad I’m married,” Will said, looking at no one in particular.

“Are you sure that’s a topic for lunch?” Zoe laughed.

“It might be useful to someone here,” I shrugged.

But there was only one other single person at the table besides me, and that was exactly who I was trying to hit.

“So that’s why single scientists don’t have sex,” Ethan said from across the table, almost making me smile, because I was already expecting a response from him.

“And we stay healthy,” I pointed my fork at him, smiling.

“That probably explains the bad mood too.”

“My mood is great,” I retorted before taking a sip of juice.

“Just use a condom,” Anna interjected, almost making me choke on my drink. “The solution to the problem... the cases you mentioned, of course,” she concluded, smiling.

I was going to kill her.

✽

Anna needed to get back to the lab before I did, so when we finished lunch, Will took the opportunity to drive her. I still had to stop by home before going back.

As I left the restaurant, I left Zoe, Ben, and his brother behind. I was waiting for a cab on the sidewalk when I felt a presence behind me.

“What happened to ‘there won’t be any conflict from my side?’” The deep, provocative voice made me turn to face him.

“Are you following me?”

“You clearly give yourself too much importance.”

“Are you trying to insult me?”

“Another question.”

“I think I’ve been polite enough to you.”

“In which part? When you called me a bastard or when you hinted I might have an STI?”

“Well... every action has a reaction. Or do you think insinuating that I don’t have sex and that I’m in a bad mood is a kind of kindness?”

“They weren’t insinuations. It’s just the truth,” he said, smiling.

Son of a bitch.

“You don’t know anything about me.”

“You know what... I was taking it easy on you, baby, but I’ve decided I won’t anymore because you’re being a bitch.” He moved closer with an irritating smirk at the corner of his lips.

“Well, it seems this relationship is well-defined. So why are you still standing in front of me?”

His proximity caused feelings in me that I would deny to the grave.

“Tell me... do you hate all men who ask you for sex?”

“No, just the ones who can’t admit their asshole behavior.”

“What do you expect? An apology? Wasn’t rejection enough?”

Why was he doing this? I didn’t want an apology; I wanted him to fuck off for being such an asshole.

“Why are you insisting on this? It’s clear to me that you’re an asshole, and I accept that, end of story.”

“So I’m an asshole just for wanting to have sex with you?”

He was trying to make me seem crazy for thinking that asking someone you just met for sex wasn’t normal.

“I’m just tired of guys like you.”

“Guys like me?”

“Guys who think all women are just sex toys.”

“That’s a completely hasty conclusion.”

“Just pretend I don’t exist.”

“That’s not going to happen. You started this.”

“I didn’t start anything, and what the hell does that mean?”

“That you have an ass too incredible to pretend it doesn’t exist.”

Huh? Did he say… He didn’t say that, did he?

“What?”

“See you around, crazy scientist,"" he said before crossing the street. I watched as he got into his car.

Was I really being too quick to judge him as a bastard just because he invited me to have sex? Damn. He was making me question myself. It doesn’t matter.

He really was a superficial bastard. It wasn’t like we were at a club, and he was some random stranger; we were at his brother’s place, and he had just met me. Did he think I’d be easy sex?

Why did that bother me so much? Damn it. I knew why. I was sick of this type of man. The kind who hides their true intentions until they get what they want. The kind who disappears the next day after getting what they want. The kind who isn’t honest and hurts a woman just to keep her as an option to satisfy his needs. The kind who hurt me just over a year ago, using me, wasting my time after all the effort I put in, opening up to him like a fool.

✽

On Friday, after a tiring week at work, we were gathered at Anna and Will's place this time, playing truth or dare.

Actually, our game could be called ""truth or truth,"" because no one ever picked dare. The game was basically just the guys asking each other embarrassing questions, and the girls doing the same, or asking their respective partners.

But this time Ethan was there, and I knew he would be there before I even came. So, I had mentally prepared myself for any little games he might play, but I wasn’t ready for this. The question that had just come out of his mouth. I looked at the faces as shocked as mine.

\*“Vanilla sex or wild sex?”\* He asked, seriously, as if he were asking if I preferred coffee or tea.

Chapter 05: You’ll Be the One Begging Me
\*\*Chapter 05: You’ll Be the One Begging Me\*\*
ELLIE

“I... I think it depends,” I finally replied, wondering if there was any interest beyond provocation and an attempt to embarrass me behind the question.

I was honest in my answer. I preferred wild sex, but making love with someone you’re in love with could be hot and mind-blowing, at least that’s how I imagined it.

“No, scientist. You have to choose, one or the other.”

“Okay. Wild sex. And that’s my cue to get another drink. Anyone else?” I stood up and headed for the kitchen.

“I’ll grab another drink too.”

“Ethan...” I heard Bennett warn.

“I’m just getting a drink, little bro, relax.”

He followed me into the kitchen.

“Is Bennett worried you’ll try to slip your hand under my skirt without my permission?” I asked before turning to face him.

He smiled, sexy as a devil.

I’m a 25-year-old guy looking for a solid, genuine bromance — the kind built on shared energy, mutual respect, and actually enjoying each other’s company.

A bit about me:

	•	I train hard and regularly — gym and cardio are a big part of my life

	•	I love traveling, discovering new places, landscapes, and getting lost in cities

	•	I’m a programmer, so I enjoy logic, curiosity, and good conversations

	•	Big fan of coffee, movement, and pushing myself mentally and physically

I’m drawn to guys who take care of themselves, are curious about the world, and know how to enjoy life — whether that’s a tough workout, spontaneous trip, or a deep late-night conversation about life and ambition.

I’m chill but intense in a good way. I value consistency, honesty, and that unspoken understanding where you motivate each other without forcing it. No drama, no weirdness — just good vibes, confidence, and mutual growth.

From Rejection to Royalty: Rise of the Forgotten Heir


“We've finally found you, Young Master,” A breathless, excited voice said from the other end of the line.

Declan’s pupils widened for just a second and his breath caught in his throat.

Then reality kicked in.

“Another scammer,” he muttered to himself as he ended the call.

Slipping his phone back into his Walmart uniform pocket, he looked down at the gift box in his hand.

A smile spread across his face.

Today was Valentine's day. Laura had been so sweet about it too. She'd told him not to worry about taking her out - she knew that he was occupied with handling both his academics and part-time work, so she didn't want to add his load.

But how could he not worry? He wanted to surprise her. Three months ago, she'd told him she wanted a rare bag while they were window shipping downtown.

The price tag had made his stomach drop - two thousand, eight hundred dollars on a ten dollar an hour wage. But he'd worked every shift he could get for months, skipped meals, scraped together every cent just to see her smile when she opened this box.

Laura deserved it. She never complained when he couldn't afford to take her out on dates. She was patient and understanding

That's why he wanted to do this for her.

Declan’s heart pounded with excitement as he stood outside her apartment door.

He could already picture the excitement on her face when she opened up this box.

The way her eyes would light up and she'd throw her arms around him and tell him that he didn't have to do this but he wanted to.

He took a deep breath and pushed open the door.

And his smile faded instantly.

There on the living room couch, tangled together, were Laura and his younger brother, Carlos.

Carlos’ hands were all over her, gripping her waist, sliding up her legs.

Her dress was halfway up, showing skin Declan thought only he had seen.

They were kissing desperately like they couldn't get enough of each other.

The gift box fell from his hands and crashed to the floor.

Laura turned to him, shocked. Her lipstick was smeared and her hair was a mess. ""Declan, what are you doing here?"" she gasped as she pushed Carlos away from her. ""I thought you said you had a night shift?”

Declan’s throat burned. For a couple of seconds, he couldn't get any words out.

The air felt too thick.

""I took the night off secretly, wishing to give you a surprise.” His voice came out bitter and raw.

""I spent nearly three months' worth of savings on this bag for you."" He pointed at the box on the floor. ""I've been helping you with your rent all this time. And this is how you repay me?”

Being questioned made her fly into a rage out of humiliation. She stood up from the couch, adjusting her dress, her eyes blazing. ""You went into my home without permission! You violated my privacy! What kind of payback did you expect?”

Declan stared at her in disbelief. ""You're cheating on me with my brother and you're talking about privacy?""

She let out a cold harsh laugh, shaking her head, “You guys are from the same family anyway. Does it make any difference who I sleep with? How is it even cheating?”

Each word hit like a knife. His teeth ground together and he stepped forward, his body tensing, ready to lunge. He couldn't breathe or even think straight.

Carlos sat up on the couch with a smirk plastered on his face like he'd just won something, “Why are you overreacting?"" he said casually. ""So what if I stole your girl?”

He leaned back against the couch again, completely relaxed like all this was some sort of joke to him.

“Don’t forget u were adopted into our family. Everything you have rightfully belongs to me, the real young master. You're just an ordinary orphan.”

“I'm not an orphan,” Declan shot back. He clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms.

“Wake up, Declan,” Carlos said in a contemptuous tone. He stood up slowly and straightened his shirt, “You were nothing but a contingency plan. Mom and Dad thought they couldn't have kids, so they got you from some adoption agency. You know, as a backup. But then medical advances came along and boom, they had me. Their real son. Naturally, you got tossed aside.""

Declan had always known he was adopted. His parents never hid it from him. But the way Derek said it, the way he threw it in his face like he was a worthless little thing made his blood boil.

Carlos walked over to the table and grabbed a crocodile leather bag studded with diamonds.

He waved it in front of Declan's face, ""With all the family resources at my disposal, I can easily get things you couldn't afford even after saving for a year. I could purchase ten of these without blinking. So of course she chose me. Who wouldn't?”

Laura stepped forward, her heels clicking. She grabbed Carlos by the collar and kissed him hard. Then she pulled back, breathless, and held the Hermès bag.

""This is what a real man gets me,"" she purred, trailing her fingers down Carlos's jaw. ""Not cheap garbage I have to pretend to like.”

She bent down and picked the box Declan had dropped, ""Leave the bag and go,"" she said flatly, like she was dismissing a delivery guy.

""You don't deserve it,"" He said through gritted teeth.

Carlos's face twisted with rage. ""How dare you speak to her that way!"" He lunged at Declan, his fist flying toward his face.

Declan didn't have time to think. Carlos lunged at him, swinging wild and clumsy. Declan caught his wrist easily - years of hauling heavy stock had made his grip iron.

He twisted and threw a punch that connected hard with Carlos' jaw. Carlos went down like a sack of bricks, crashing into the coffee table. The glass shattered and he hit the floor, yelling as blood trickled from his corners of the mouth.

Laura screamed something but he didn't hear it. His ears were ringing. His vision was blurred with rage and pain and betrayal.

Without waiting to see if Carlos got back up, Declan turned and stormed out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him so hard the walls shook.

The cold night air stung. He stumbled onto the street with shaky legs and trembling hands.

For a moment, he just stood there under a flickering streetlight.

His fists were clenched so tight that his nails drew blood from his palms.

One day, he thought, he'd have the power to get back at everyone who'd wronged him.

Everyone who'd looked down on him, stepped on him, treated him like he was nothing.

Laura. Carlos. His adoptive parents who'd always favored Carlos over him and never failed to remind him of his position in the family.

Every single one of them. He would make sure they'd regret it.

Just then, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

He pulled it out, expecting to see another spam call. But what he saw on the screen made his heart stop

\*\*$100,000,000 deposited into account ending in 4829.\*\*

\*\*Balance: $100,000,247.83\*\*

He blinked and rubbed his eyes rapidly. Was this a dream?

He looked again but the numbers remained the same.

""What the..."" He whispered, counting the zeros one by one. One hundred million dollars in his account. His hands started shaking worse than before.

His phone rang. It was the same unknown number from earlier.

His hand trembled as he answered. ""Hello?""

""Young master, please don't hang up,"" the voice said urgently. ""I know you think I'm a scammer. That's why I just wired one hundred million dollars to your account. Check it. It's real. I can wait while you verify it with your bank if you need to.”

Declan's mouth went dry.

He stared at the notification again, his heart pounding so hard he could hear it in his ears. This couldn't be real.

It had to be some kind of mistake. But he could see the numbers right there, glowing on his screen.

""Who... who are you?"" He managed to say, his voice barely above a whisper.

""My name is Franklin. I'm the head butler of the Steele Family. And you, young master, are the heir we've been searching for.”

The Steele Family.

His mind reeled. That name echoed through his head.

The Steele Family was one of the top oligarch families in the country.

Everyone knew their name. They controlled industries, influenced politics, and owned half the city's real estate.

They were the kind of people you only saw on the news or in magazine.

The real untouchables.

And this man was saying he was their heir?

""That's impossible,"" Declan said, his voice shaking.

""It's not impossible, young master,"" Franklin said gently. ""It's the truth. You are the young master of the Steele Family. And we've finally found you.”

Declan couldn't speak. His mind was blank as he tried to process what this man had just said. He was the Steele Family's heir. Him?

Franklin noticed his silence, then clearing his throat, he continued in a calm and patient voice.

""I understand this is difficult to believe, young master. And that's understandable. After we finally found you, we discovered that the Reyes Family who adopted you had always told you that you were an orphan. But that wasn't the case at all.""

Declan’s heart pounded. ""What are you talking about?""

""In truth, you are the young master of the Steele Family,"" Franklin went on. ""You were separated from your birth parents in a tragic incident shortly after you were born. It was only recently that we managed to track you down.""

Declan leaned against the brick wall of a nearby building, his legs suddenly weak.

""If that's true,"" He said slowly, his voice hoarse, ""then why haven't my parents come to find me themselves? Why are you calling me instead of them?""

Franklin sighed. ""The situation within the Steele Family is extremely complicated right now, young master. Suddenly introducing a grown heir is a very sensitive matter. There are power struggles and people who wouldn't be happy about your return. For your safety and theirs, contact between you and your parents has to be restricted for now. Your identity has to remain secret.""

His throat tightened.

""But please understand,"" Franklin continued quickly, as though he could sense Declan’s disappointment, ""Your parents want nothing more than to bring you home. I can assure you of that, young master. To make up for all the years you've lost, they've taken steps to ensure your future. They've secretly transferred one hundred million dollars to your account. And that's not all.""

""They've also transferred ownership of Apex Financial Corporation to you. It's the largest financial enterprise in Riverton. The CEO will be in touch with you shortly to discuss the details.""

His mind went blank. Apex Financial Corporation. He'd heard that name before. Everyone in Riverton had, in fact.

They owned shopping malls, office buildings, and investment firms. They were literally everywhere. And now this man was telling him that he owned it?

""A hundred million dollars,"" Declan whispered. ""A whole company. Just... just given to me?""

""Yes, young master. It's your birthright. Everything that should have been yours from the beginning."" Franklin said, then his tone turned urgent, “Young master, we've been on the line too long. To avoid any risk of being traced or monitored, I need to hang up now. But I'll be in touch again very soon. Please take care of yourself. And remember, you must keep your identity secret for now.""

The line went dead before Declan could say anything.

He stood there on the empty street, staring at his phone.

The notification was still glowing on the screen. One hundred million dollars. Real money. This was not some dream or a scam.

His whole life had just been turned upside down in the span of fifteen minutes.

He stood in that spot for a long time, trying to process everything

The sting from Carlos' punch had faded completely now.

His mind kept replaying everything that had happened tonight. Laura and Carlos on that couch. The fight. The betrayal. The money. The phone call. The Steele Family.

Just moments ago, he'd been humiliated for being poor and not being able to afford nice things.

For being nothing more than an adopted orphan with no future. And now he was suddenly worth hundreds of millions.

His phone rang again, bringing him back to reality. He looked at the screen.

It was his adoptive mother calling.

He answered. ""Hello?""

""How dare you!"" she screamed into the phone, her voice filled with rage. ""How dare you steal Carlos' girlfriend! What is wrong with you? You ungrateful piece of trash! Get out of my home right now!""

Declan’s jaw tightened. Of course. Knowing Carlos, he must have called her, spinning some story about how he was the one in the wrong.

""Carlos is the one who stole my girlfriend,”

“""Don't you dare talk back to me!"" Clarke screamed. ""Get home now or I'll make sure you regret it!”

The line went dead.

Declan stared at his phone for a moment. He had a hundred million dollars in his account now. He didn't need to go back there, to that family that despised him.

But he still had things at that house. His clothes, his books and a few other belongings.

He needed to get them before they destroyed everything.

When Declan walked through the front gate of the Reyes Family house, he went still.

There in the yard, his belongings had already been stuffed into black garbage bags and thrown onto the lawn.

Clothes, textbooks, his old sneakers, everything he owned was scattered across the grass in plastic bags that were already getting wet from the light drizzle.

The parents he had known for as long as he could remember were in the front yard, glaring at me. His adoptive mother, Clarke had her arms crossed and her face twisted with disgust while his father, Tom stood beside her with a cold, cruel expression.

""You've got some nerve showing your face here,"" Clarke spat.

Anger surged through him ""It was Carlos who stole my girlfriend,"" His voice shook with rage as he spoke, ""Not the other way around. I caught them together on her couch.""

""Shut up!"" Clarke screamed ""Why would Carlos ever want something you had? You think you have anything worth taking?""

Tom stepped forward, ""You're the one who's jealous of Carlos. You've always been jealous of him. Not the other way around.""

Declan laughed bitterly. Well, they were not so wrong. ""Of course I'm jealous. How could I not be? You've never treated me as a son,” He said, “You made me live in a storage room while Carlos got the master bedroom. You made me do all the chores while he sat around doing nothing. You never gave me a single cent. Even with my tuition, I had to scrape it together myself by working jobs I hated, jobs that made me want to die from exhaustion.""

Clarke's face turned red. ""Finally! Finally you admit it! You resent your brother. After everything we've done for you, after raising you all these years, you're still an ungrateful wretch.""

""We should have thrown you back to the orphanage the moment Carlos was born,"" Tom added coldly.

Clarke’s eyes shone with hatred, ""Well, today we're going to teach you a lesson you'll never forget."" She turned to the side and snapped her fingers. ""Get him!”

Four men stepped out from behind the house. Declan had not seen them before. They were big, rough-looking with intimidating muscles.

They surrounded him fast. One cracked his knuckles, grinning while the other pulled out a baton and tapped it on his palm.

Declan clenched his fists, ready to fight back. He'd already beaten Carlos tonight and he could handle these people, too.

The first thug lunged forward with his baton raised high while others closed in from all sides. Three feet away. Two feet.

The baton came swinging down towards his head –

Just as Declan was about to raise his fists, the sound of an engine roared through the quiet street.

A luxury car, the kind he had only ever seen in magazines, came to a stop outside the gate. It was sleek, black, with tinted windows that reflected the streetlights.

Everyone froze.

The driver's door opened first. A man in a black suit stepped out. He moved quickly to the back door and opened it.

Then, a woman stepped out.

She was stunning. The kind of beauty that didn't seem real, that made you forget how to breathe.

Her long black hair fell over her shoulders in perfect waves.

She wore a tailored white suit that hugged her figure. Her heels clicked against the pavement as she walked forward.

Behind her, a row of bodyguards emerged from a second car that Declan hadn't even noticed pulling up. Six of them, all tall and built, all wearing dark suits and earpieces, fell into formation behind her, their faces stoic.

The woman looked around. Her gaze landed on him, surrounded by servants with makeshift weapons, and her expression hardened.

""Stop!""

The woman's voice cut through the tension in the yard ""Clear them out. All of them!""

Her bodyguards moved instantly. The hired thugs saw them coming and their faces went white. They dropped their weapons and within seconds, all of them had scrambled away.

Tom and Clarke stared with their mouths hanging open. Mark took a step back, his earlier confidence completely gone. Clarke's face had gone pale and her hands trembled at her sides.

The woman turned to Declan and her entire demeanor changed. The ice-cold authority vanished.

She bowed deeply, her voice soft and respectful. ""Young Master, forgive me for arriving late. Please, allow me to take you away from here.""

She extended her hand, waiting for his permission.

Declan hesitated for a moment, his heart still pounding from the confrontation, then he stepped toward her. Her hand was warm when it touched his arm and she guided him gently to her side with the care of someone handling something precious.

He could feel the eyes of his adoptive parents burning into him from across the yard but he didn't look back.

""Who are you?"" Declan asked quietly.

The woman kept her eyes lowered respectfully. ""My name is Victoria Mathews. I'm the CEO of Apex Financial Group."" She paused, her tone becoming even more deferential. ""But to you, Young Master, I am simply your loyal servant. I'm here to serve you in any way you need.”

Declan's breath caught. Apex Financial Group. It was the company that Charles had mentioned on the phone. The company that supposedly now belonged to him. And this stunning, powerful woman was here to serve him?

""Who are you?"" Clarke screamed, her face twisted with rage. ""How dare you come into our home and touch our people!""

Victoria turned slowly with a cold expression on her face, ""I would very much prefer to ask who you are instead.""

Tom stepped forward confidently and arrongantly, ""We are the Reyes Family,"" he announced with pride. ""And you just made a very big mistake.""

Victoria's eyebrow arched slightly. ""The Reyes Family? I'm afraid I've never heard of you.""

Clarke’s face went red with indignation. ""Never heard of us? Well, that just shows what kind of low class nobody you are. The Reyes Family is well known in Riverton. We're partners with the Harrington family. Anyone with breeding and proper connections knows our name. But I suppose a woman like you wouldn't know anything about that.”

Tom nodded with a smug smile playing on his face, ""That's right. We have real connections and real power. We'll forgive your ignorance this time. As long as you leave right now, we can let bygones be bygones. Walk away and we'll forget this ever happened.""

Victoria's lips curved into a small, cold smile ""Are you threatening me?""

""Are you threatening us?"" Clarke shot back. ""Because if you still dare to make a move today, we'll retaliate tomorrow. The Harrington Family won't stand for this disrespect!""

Victoria's smile widened, now contemptuous. She looked at them like they were just filthy insects. Then she said one word, her voice calm and clear.

""Strike.""

The bodyguards immediately closed in on Clarke and Tom. Tom tried to back away but one of the bodyguards grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back. Clarke screamed, but another bodyguard had already seized her shoulder, forcing her to her knees.

“You can't do this!” She screamed, “We'll sue you. We'll press charges,”

But Victoria had already turned away from them. She placed a gentle hand on Declan’s back. ""Let's go.""

She guided him toward the luxury car. Declan followed with wobbly legs. Behind him, he could hear Clarke and Tom shouting, cursing, threatening lawsuits and revenge. But their voices grew fainter as they neared the car.

The bodyguard opened the car door and Victoria gestured for Declan to get in. The interior screamed luxury. Leather seats that were softer than anything he'd ever touched and it smelled like expensive cologne and new car. He sank into the seat and Victoria slid in beside him.

The door closed, cutting off the chaos outside.

""Won't this cause problems?"" Declan asked, his voice filled with worry. ""If they hit them too hard, there could be legal issues, police involvement. I don't want you to get in trouble because of me,”

Victoria turned to him with a soft expression, ""Please don't worry, Young Master. I know my limits. My men are trained professionals. They'll deliver a message without causing permanent damage."" She paused for a moment. ""But anyone who offends you offends the entire Apex Financial Group that I manage. I cannot and will not tolerate it.""

""Thank you,"" he said.

Victoria gave him a small smile, “It's my duty and my honor."" She leaned back into her seat as the car began to move. ""Now, Young Master, where are you staying tonight?""

Declan opened his mouth, then closed it. Where was he staying? His belongings were in garbage bags scattered across the Reyes Family lawn. He didn't belong to any place now.

Victoria noticed his hesitation immediately. ""I apologize for the presumption, but I have a solution if you'll allow it. I have a place under my name where you can stay temporarily, Young Master. Once I get things sorted out, I'll arrange somewhere even better for you.""

""Where is it?"" Declan asked.

""The Grand Silverton Hotel.""

Declan's eyes widened. The Grand Silverton was one of the most exclusive hotels in Riverton. He'd passed by it before but never imagined he'd actually stay there.

Victoria continued, ""I'll take you to the hotel entrance and have the manager come out personally to receive you. Unfortunately, I have a meeting I must attend tonight, so I'll have to leave you there. But rest assured, the staff will take care of everything you need.""

“Fine,” Declan said, looking out of the window as the car started moving.

The drive through Riverton felt surreal. The streets blurred past and the neon lights reflected off the tinted windows.

Declan's mind kept replaying the events of the night. It felt too much to process all at once.

Twenty minutes later, the car pulled up in front of a towering building.

The Grand Silverton Hotel. The building shone with golden lights, its entrance flanked by uniformed doormen.

Victoria turned to him. ""I'll be in touch tomorrow morning. If you need anything tonight, the staff will take care of you.""

“Alright,"" Declan said.

Victoria smiled, then her car pulled away into the Riverton traffic. Declan stood there for a moment, staring up at the massive hotel.

Then he walked inside.

Twenty-four hours ago, he'd been nothing. Now he owned half of Riverton.

And for the first time in years, he felt like his life was actually moving forward.

---

On the other side of the city, in Laura's rental apartment, the atmosphere was tense.

Laura knelt beside Carlos on the couch, dabbing medicine onto the bruise that was already forming on his cheek. ""I can't believe Declan dared to hit you,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Declan has always been pathetic, but tonight he crossed a line.""

Carlos winced as she pressed too hard against the bruise. ""Not only did he hit me, but he ruined our entire night."" His jaw clenched. ""We need to teach him a lesson. Make him understand his place.""

Laura set down the medicine bottle and traced her fingers along Carlos's body. ""What about tonight though?"" she purred. ""I was still waiting to experience your prowess.""

Carlos grinned despite the pain in his face. His hand slid up her leg. ""Who says we need to wait? How about I take you somewhere special? The Grand Silverton Hotel. We can get a room there and have a proper night.""

Laura's eyes lit up. ""The Grand Silverton? Really?""

""Really,"" Carlos said, pulling her closer. ""Only the best for you.""

An hour later, they arrived at the hotel. Carlos pulled out his credit card at the reception desk, trying not to wince at the outrageous price. Four thousand dollars for one night. It was ridiculous, but he needed to impress Laura and show her he could provide things Declan never could.

The receptionist processed the payment and handed him two key cards. ""Room 1847. Enjoy your stay.""

Carlos took Laura's hand and led her toward the elevators. But as they passed through the lobby, Laura suddenly stopped.

""Carlos, look.""

He followed her gaze through the floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the hotel's private garden. The garden was lit with soft golden lights that enhanced it's beauty. And there, strolling casually along one of those paths, was Declan.

Carlos felt his blood run cold. ""What the...?""

Laura's mouth fell open. ""How is he here? Shouldn't he be staying in his storage room at your parents' house?""

The stereotypical tropes of - 95% of girls wanting a guy with a 'mullet-moe', '4x4' - camping, making only you pay the dates (and being verbal about it), and just drag you on for the chase with no intent on either meeting up or going any further...

My personality is very; geek, niche hobbiest (music/art/painting), gym, community work, and active - and I've been complimented that my pictures portray those sides of me. I always need to be doing something. I can be adventurous, but next to all the traits every girl on the app (in australia anyway) wants, I can't compete - I just be me, but apparently that isn't enough anymore...  


Every situationship I've been in, I'm forever initiating the conversation, making plans, paying for a date (without them asking or bringing it up) and yet, I'm tossed to the side, they go days or even a week or so without even messaging me first once, or the latter...I genuinely don't know where I'm going wrong. 

You know the crazy thing, one girl even said I was 'too nice', like what the hell does that even mean? I find myself a free-spirited, go with the flow type and very low maintenance. Sure I've had childhood trauma, but I'm sorry \*name\* that, me being genuine and caring is too boring next to your 'abusive' ex's and that having someone who supports you is considered lame. 

I feel like I'm exciting enough, first dates; are usuall a coffee/walk/thrift store vibe - and get to know each other to see if we have a connection. Seconds (if I ever get there), would be something more interactive, i.e. go-karting, beach days, road trip...but even girls in their 30s will text me after the first date and go ""sorry, you're just too young for me"" - like WHY EVEN GO ON A DATE WITH ME?

  
I don't want to be an incel, but I'm really tired of making more effort with things than is received, and some are oblivious to the fact. I can find happines and content with doing my own activities, but sometimes it's just nice to have that extra person with you. I'm tired.

From that day onwards I always kept waiting for her to come but she never showed up, Still I am waiting for her but I know somewhere inside my heart is that she will never return.

1qqyvw0,https://archive.ph/vP4Q1,Trump Says He Only Appeared to Nod Off in Last Cabinet Meeting Because It Was ‘Boring’,"President Trump said on Thursday that he had appeared to be fighting sleep during a cabinet meeting last month because “it got pretty boring, no offense.”

Mr. Trump, at the start of his first cabinet meeting of 2026, maintained that he had not actually fallen asleep at December’s meeting, but that he had closed his eyes “because I wanted to get the hell out of there.” He added, “I don’t sleep much, let me tell you.”

Mr. Trump’s allies had strenuously insisted that Mr. Trump had been alert and attentive during last month’s meeting. Even so, the president acknowledged to a reporter for New York magazine that he had closed his eyes, saying that the meeting had been “boring as hell.”

Last month’s cabinet meeting — which lasted 2 hours 18 minutes — wasn’t even the longest of his second term, with one in August lasting 3 hours 17 minutes. Much of the time spent in these televised meetings is devoted to his advisers offering lengthy, fawning praise for the president and his achievements. At one point during last month’s gathering, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested that Mr. Trump had “kept the hurricanes away.”

On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed his “love” for the members of his cabinet. “But there’s a lot of people,” he said. “It was a little bit on the boring side.” This time, he insisted, “we are not going to go through the whole table.”

True to his word, Mr. Trump skipped over many prominent members of his cabinet including Ms. Noem; Pam Bondi, the attorney general; and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state — notable omissions amid his ICE crackdown in Minnesota and aggressive foreign policy abroad. The public portion of the gathering lasted about an hour and 20 minutes.

Almost as an afterthought, Mr. Trump addressed Vice President JD Vance: “JD, if you’d like to say something you can. He is, after all, the vice president of the United States.”

Mr. Vance replied, “It’s OK, sir, I’m here for the free coffee.”",1,1769758119.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

☕ Black Coffee – The 6-Step Formula:



1. ✅ Why should you drink it? (Benefits):



Increases mental alertness and focus.



Supports fat oxidation in the body.



Helpful for those trying to lose weight.



Contains antioxidants called 'Polyphenols'.



2. ☕ How much to drink? (Quantity):

Do not exceed 300-400 mg of caffeine per day (maximum 3 to 4 small cups).



3. 📅 How long to drink? (Duration):



Generally, it can be consumed as a daily habit.



However, to avoid caffeine dependence, drink it for 1-2 weeks and then give a gap of 3-4 days. This prevents withdrawal symptoms like headaches if you miss a coffee.



4. ⏰ When to drink? (Timing):



Do not drink immediately after waking up. Drink it 30 minutes to 1 hour after waking up.



Do not drink after 3:00 PM or 3:30 PM (it disturbs sleep).



5. 🥤 How to drink? (The Method):



Most Important: Do not add sugar, jaggery, honey, milk, or cream.



It must be taken as a plain decoction with water only.



Adding anything else destroys its medicinal properties. The benefits are found only in pure black coffee.



6. ⚠️ Side Effects of Incorrect Usage: If not consumed correctly or if taken in excess, it causes:



Acidity, Gastritis, and Heartburn.



Anxiety and Heart Palpitations (Gunde dada).

1qqymg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusDrivers/comments/1qqymg8/new_job_long_story/,New job. Long Story.,"I recently started a new bus driving job. I totally love it! It’s boring as  get out. I love boring. Anyway I’m making 35.00 an hour and I get benefits.

My last position didn’t last very long because I was the new guy who was willing to pick up extra shifts and work 14 hour days. I wanted to make that extra money. I was making $25 an hour.

after about two months of working 14 hour days. My mental health really suffered. I literally started wondering if I was bipolar because I was so exhausted. I had to get up super early every day and I worked until it was dark. I literally had to get off of work come home walk my dogs  dinner. Make lunch for the next day and try and get to bed by 7:30 PM.

It affected me in ways I could never understand. I was exhausted all the time. There wasn’t enough coffee in the world. I was having mood shifts. Eventually, it just got to me and I blew up because I just couldn’t do it anymore.

so now, I have the highest paying job in my entire area. Suddenly, I’m receiving text messages and emails asking me to work on my days off. I write  I cannot and I’m sorry. I am no longer   the gate. I don’t wanna work on my days off. I don’t want to work more than eight hours a day. I wanna be eight and done 40 and done. That’s it that’s all. I don’t wanna be the company girl. I don’t  be anybody’s favorite.

I will drive the  on the lot. I will be so well rested that my passengers will think they’re driving in a limousine because I’m a very friendly happy person when I get to sleep.

i’m starting to feel the pressure of working on my days off, but I’m still just not gonna do it. I want them to think of  that person that shows up on time never calls in sick goes home and isn’t in the text tree.

Well, they hate me? Will they appreciate that I’m the person that shows up for her scheduled shift. Does a good job and then goes home?

I don’t know. I really like this job. I really want this job. I don’t want to work more than eight hours a day.

The company says we need. We need. We need! I think, you need to hire more people. You need to end your not poaching agreements with other companies. You don’t need me to fix your corporate mistakes.

Am I overthinking?,"So I work in a big store and there’s a girl I like who works on a completely different floor (I’m on the 4th floor, she’s on -1).

A few days ago I went down there using the excuse that I was “looking for a gift for my sister” (I don’t actually have a sister, I just wanted to start a conversation). We talked a bit, learned each other’s names, and since then I’ve passed by a few times just to say hi and make small talk.

She always seemed friendly, smiled, joked a little (I teased her about her Adidas tracksuit once and she laughed), asked where I work, what I do, etc. Nothing awkward.

Eventually I followed her on Instagram, she followed back, and we exchanged a few short messages. She even sent me a gym video with her friend. Sometimes she replies fast, sometimes slow.

Yesterday I went to her section again, helped her with a couple of sales, and we talked more about work, studies, and random stuff. At one point she was standing pretty close to me and the vibe felt comfortable.

Before leaving, I told her I had to go back upstairs and directly asked:

“Would you like to go for a coffee sometime?”

She said yes, smiled, and I handed her my phone so she could type her contact, but she joked that her supervisor might see and “send her to the unemployment office” (lol), so we didn’t do it right there.

Later that day I messaged her on Instagram saying I just finished my exams and asked if she’d like to go for coffee on Sunday.

It’s been about 5 hours with no reply yet, and I’m starting to overthink — even though she said yes in person.

Am I reading too much into the response time?

These things are pretty nice!! They don’t sound as grand and awesome as my Ananda nanos did, but they do sound excellent. Sound stage is surprisingly big considering they’re close back.

If you’re thinking about getting these for gaming, delay shouldn’t even cross your mind trust me. It’s a bigger delay than most headphones on paper, but in practice, you won’t be able to hear it

Sound is very very flat. Guitar sounds INCREDIBLE, Toms sound INCREDIBLE… I do wish there was just a BIT more UMPH... a bit more POWA. Going to mess with EQ to see what I can work up. Bass boost actually does a pretty decent job as adding some “UMPH” to the songs… but it’s a bit too much low end for my taste. It also does get rid of some of that sweet sweet snare crack… goddd the snare crack… mmmmm.

ARE THEY BETTER THAN THE ANANDA NANO?

That’s a tough one… I think they are very different… these feel… smoother. It feels like comparing an oil painting to a pencil drawing… the pencil drawing is, SCARY realistic… the details in the pores are there… you can almost touch the item in the painting… the oil painting is smooth… almost a perfect balance or realism with artistic almost cartoonish style. It is abstract, it is almost bubbly. Its clean. The nanos makes me feel like I am in the front row of a concert… speakers blasting, you can hear every minute detail of the instruments, but boy are they fucking loud… the Sennheiser, feels like I’m sitting outside with a cigar and my morning coffee, listening to breaking Benjamin, I prevail, mixed in with some Christian worship music, some skillet, might even dabble in some classic music depending on the day… Sennheiser just feels… so… right… it’s very hard to explain. It’s crazy because I’ve always enjoyed loud in your fave V shape EQ… but these Sennheisers are kind of winning me over mannn. They are just pleasant to listen to… my nanos give me that “holy shite that was intense” feeling after 4 songs… these guys? I can blast this shite all night and feel alive till the morning.

it’s so odd. This is my first ever Sennheiser headphone (Ananda nano was my first “audiophile” headphone) it’s honestly beautiful how different these 2 headphones sound. The emotion, the impact, the sound that they have are so vastly different… now I understand why people have multiple headphones… anyways. Going to go back to rocking out in my pitch black room with my protein shake in hand, at 1AM. Take care yall 😉🤘",7,1769757093.0,sennheiser,0,1.0,False

1qqyhwq,https://i.redd.it/rg4johml6fgg1.jpeg,"I was pirated, and it changed my outlook. My story.","This may be a long read. I just need to get some things off my chest.

You know how it goes, between life, work, etc., etc., you just get run down. Between that and my raging midlife crisis, I’ve felt a little blah lately, and that’s probably me downplaying it. After a rough weekend of being sick, taking kids everywhere, and not catching a break, I ended up having a day off to myself. Wife and kids would be home from school late, so I got up early and decided today was all-you-can-eat Star Citizen. I settled in with my breakfast and my coffee, ready to start the day, not moving from my computer. I really needed this.

I started in Orison and thought I’d just haul some goods to Levski. I went to Deakins and loaded my nice Asgard up with a mix of iodine, meds, bioplastic, all things just to make a profit on the run. I sat there for an hour loading every inch of that Asgard, even waiting for the stock to reset. The kids call this min-maxing. I call it putting *all* my eggs into one nice, neat little basket.

As I walked away from the terminal one last time, someone came in. He was dressed like a pirate, and I thought to myself, *Wow, this guy sure looks like a pirate!* I stood there and saluted this man. Then I just carried on outside, where I saw his Shiv and thought, *Ooo, this guy has a pirate ship even*. This is what an author may call subtle foreshadowing.

As I lazily gained altitude, blissful of my incoming demise, I admired the clouds. Star Citizen is a screenshot simulator sometimes. I looked out my front glass admiring the view when I saw a red notification that read, “In interdiction field.”

*Well, that’s new.*

I then admired the distortions ping off my hull. The whole pirate cosplay made sense now. That nice man pretending to be a pirate was in fact not pretending and was now going to kill me. I take back my salute.

I knew my only shot was just to turn around to Deakins and get to the armistice zone, but these guys were professionals. I was disabled in seconds from the distortions, and even with engineering allowing me to get power back once, I was downed again. My rear ramp shot open, and a team of two incapacitated me like they had done this before. I was face down, ass up in the sand as I watched them board my Asgard and speed off with over 2 million aUEC worth of my goods.

I woke up in a hospital bed wondering if this is how my day off was going to go. I wasn’t mad, though, because these guys weren’t griefers. They scoped me out, set me in a perfect trap, and were gone before anyone could respond. I love it, they even thanked me in chat as they sold my goods at Grim Hex. Pleasure doing business with you in this one-sided transaction, and ggs.

I did want to make back some money, and I kind of wanted a little PvP revenge too. In chat, someone was asking for gunners and would pay 10m aUEC, enough to cover my losses and then some. I came aboard, and before long we had a fully crewed Hammerhead. We were out to do some player bounties, and when they shared the contract, I asked, “You guys know who this is, right?”

Citizenspooner. He streams and creates content — very good pilot, very fun to watch. Most of the crew didn’t know, but a few of us knew maybe a Hammerhead wasn’t going to be enough.

Hey, guess what? It was not enough.

As soon as we rolled up, we knew. We all let out a good “Tonight we dine in hell!” and went in.

I don’t know how long the battle lasted. I know I lost pips halfway through the fight. I was able to take out Citizenspooner’s shields once, but that was it. We were floating debris in no time. He had several Idris capital ships, a Perseus, and who knows what else. I was waking up in a med bed for the second time today already. Rather than give up, we decided to double down with a plan.

We were able to crew two Polaris, each with fighters in the hangar, along with other fighter support. The plan was: we would meet at the designated spot, group up, and quantum in together. The fighters would go after the bounty, the capital ships would keep our backs clear. It was a good plan, and we were confident. But the best plan always begins with step one.

Go back and read step one. Meet at a designated spot. I don’t know who the pilot of our Polaris was, but I can assure you Leeroy Jenkins would be proud. We somehow skipped the meetup and quantumed right to Citizenspooner and his fleet. Our fighters aren’t ready, support isn’t ready, but here we are.

*Alright chums, let’s do this*. I scramble to my Firebird and launch out. We have two fighters in the air at least. I’m able to lock the bounty and launch missiles, volley after volley, but he flares them off and evades well. No lucky hits here. I think I got a few size 3 Gatlings into him before he took me out.

I wake up in a med bed for the third time today aboard a burning Polaris. *This is fine*. I make my way to a gunner seat just as we lose power. Our hangar is wide open too. We call for everyone to prepare for boarders and take cover. I’m watching into our hangar as bullets fly inside, a single lone L-21 Wolf exploding on the pad. There are bodies on the ground. Pretty soon they start to EVA through the roof. I’m able to take down one or two with my Parallax rifle (Kopion tooth skin, of course) and revive some allies in the chaos.

Then I spot him. Citizenspooner is EVA outside of the open hangar. I get a few shots on him maybe, but have to take cover to reload. There are explosions everywhere. Wreckage in our hangar, fires and alarms going off, and we are taking heavy fire. We are not going to last long at all. The boarding attempt has been repelled, but we are still dead in the water. Everyone abandons ship, but the gunfire has stopped.

Right about the time we should be exploding into oblivion, our second Polaris arrives and takes the heat off my ship. Our crew is out EVA, grabbing whatever ships they can. I make my way to engineering, and here I am with a little baby multitool and a lot of warning lights. I’m able to slowly walk around and power the shields, then find the coolers, and finally the power plant after using the engineering terminal to locate it. Just then, I hear the PDCs come to life, and man they are angry.

Just then I get a notification that the bounty has been claimed. It was one of our guys who used an Eclipse to size-9 torpedo him straight to Klescher. I’ll be honest, it was a pretty sweet feeling. We were all really stoked. That lasted about a minute, until I realized there were probably three Idris outside looking for revenge. I make it to the bridge, slam into quantum, and get out of there alive.

When this game is at its best, I will die on the hill that there is no other experience like it. Nothing. What these developers have delivered continues to astound me, even after years of playtime. We had a dozen or so people come together to claim a bounty, and it triggered a full-on fleet battle. It didn’t go to plan in the best ways possible. None of this was scripted. None of this was a cutscene or a mission. It was just a sandbox in the truest sense of the word.

It left me feeling a lot better, even the pirating. The game has never felt more alive. It was something I needed. I was headed in a gloomy direction, and this game gave me a much better outlook. I hope some developer reads this and understands that this game means a lot to many of us, and I thank them for what they do. I guess sometimes we can get down about this game. We complain about bugs, inventory, servers, and balance — I get that. My life is sometimes a mess too, but it’s still awesome. This game was a great reminder to appreciate everything good we have and just work on the bad.

This is actually only the first half of the story, but this is already too long-winded.  
**TL;DR:** Thank you, CIG, for giving us such a great game.",82,1769756740.0,starcitizen,28,0.89,False

**The math:**  
\- 10,000 users search places daily  
\- 5 searches per user = 50,000 API calls/day  
\- Google charges \~$0.017 per place search  
\- **That's $850/day = $25,500/month**

We'd be bankrupt yesterday.

**Our solution: The ""Spine Database""**  
We built a canonical European place database using **Postgres + PostGIS** that:  
\- Stores place data locally (no API call needed)  
\- Only calls Google when we don't have the data  
\- Caches results for future users (Legally of course)  
\- Adds data from European sources Google doesn't have

**How it works:**  
1. You search for ""coffee in Paris""  
2. ViaVia checks spine database first (free)  
3. If not found, calls Google (costs money)

I am a visual designer. I recently finished my M.Des degree, and previously I have around 1.5 years of experience in Strategic Communication. Currently, I am working as a Communication Manager, where my work includes both design and content components, and while I love my job, I do miss branding and illustration work. So, I have been thinking of starting freelancing. 

I am still in the process of updating my portfolio, but I have done some design work for a few non-profit organisations, a coffee roaster brand, and some illustrations for a poet friend. But I do not know where or how can I can get some freelance projects. I know there are some websites, but I've heard from people that you can only get work there as a newbie if you drastically underprice yourself, which is something I don't want to do. But then again, I know better than to rely on word-of-mouth reviews.

1qqyfgu,https://i.redd.it/dtzpl7luofgg1.png,ARAM Tierlist based on my ARAM Win Rate. (2000 games played) + ARAM warm takes,"So I was inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/1cslpbc/aram_tierlist_based_on_my_aram_win_rate_5221/) post by u/[CoffeeStrength](https://www.reddit.com/user/CoffeeStrength/) a year and a half back, and after playing my 2000th game of ARAM, took a look at my WRs.

Sorted by lifetime aram win rate from highest to lowest in each tier, except the 0% tier and the banned/<10 games tier. <10 tier was cut due to low sample size. I exclusively solo queue.

Some interesting tidbits:

1. Gaz #1 at 72% (16W-6L) is kinda surprising. I sometimes think of playing him as spectating the game until level 10. Like srsly he’s so bad pre-10, E is your only relevant skill till 7, it’s on a 12s CD, and even 7 only gives your W a slow. His 10 is good, and ofc his 20 is great, but I don’t think he’s that good. Orphea #2 at 70% (14W-6L) is also kinda surprising. I like her, but don’t really think of myself as an Orphea player. Would have thought she would land in the 50s. Both have low sample sizes, so probably variance.
2. Then comes 5 healers - Deck (47W-22L), Malfurion (32W-15L), Brightwing (33W-18L), Tyrande (33W-18L), Li Li (27W-16L). I am a double healer addict, and force it very often. The result of this is a very high number of games on healers than other roles. My healer WR is way higher than the other roles. I really felt Li Li’s heal buff a while back, she went from “not enough healing almost all the time” to “usually fine, occasionally not enough throughput” and I like her so much more now.
3. At the 55% range are a grab bag of various characters, most are pretty decent ARAM picks. Kind of surprising to see Azmo/Nazeebo below so many characters. I love Alex (37W-28L) - I used to have a much lower WR on her, like 45%. I now go Q build most games (whenever I go W build I watch my heals’ 7s CD and regret it) with Life Binder and just healbot. I never intentionally interact with the enemy team outside of dragon. I don’t even think about using E unless it’s completely safe. Idk if it’s optimal but it gets me results!
4. 50% actually has some of my most popular DPSes. I love Zagara (this is a little low for her I think), Tass and Kael. Chromie is also just at exactly 50%, even though I think I do fine on her.
5. At 40% we have Junk and Valla. I’m not the best Junk, but wasn’t expecting him and Valla to be so low. KTZ is here because I can’t combo. I spend my (unwilling) KTZ games flailing around with Q build and frost blast, failing combos. Once in a blue moon I land a combo and shade at 20 helps. Also, apparently I can’t Morales or Lucio - not the two healers I would have thought would be here.
6. Sub 35% we have a bunch of tanks that I just suck at, most of which I already knew I sucked at and don’t play unless I have to, but some surprise me (I play a lot of Stitch (12W-24L)). Rip my teammates who have to deal with me tanking on these characters. The standout here though is Li-Ming, at a dismal 34.3% (12W-23L). Idk how - I go the usual orb build, I see all the Mings in my games going nuts and clipping people with orbs for more than half their HP, but I just lose with her. Besides Ming, the rest of the DPSes here are pretty mid DPSes for ARAM.
7. I have ruined 14 games with Jaina and won only once. Also, I have 0 wins and 9 losses with Falstad.
8. Many of the <10 games group are characters I don’t pick, either because they suck or because I can’t play them. Most of them have terrible WRs. All my 0% WR characters also fall into this category. The closest to 10 are Falstad, Garrosh (5W-4L), Probius (3W-5L) and Malthael (1W-7L).
9. Maybe 2000 games isn’t enough sample size. It sounds like a lot to me, but a lot of characters don’t have many games.

Will also post a “hot takes” section in the comments, cause I think it’s funny to hear someone’s opinions on a hero knowing their WR with them.

Edit: Can't seem to comment, so enjoy your wall of text hot takes:

Hot takes:  
\- More like warm takes, because imo I don’t deviate from meta too much  
\- obv only for ARAM  
\- just my opinion, ymmv, but will state them like they are facts  
\- be prepared for words, no TLDR for you

1 tank-2 dps-2 healer is excellent and imo the best setup in pubs, 2 tank-1 dps-2 healer is much worse, and often worse than single healer. Double healer works best if at least one healer does some damage - things like BW/Morales can be kinda sad, especially if you are also doing 2-1-2.  
  
Gaz: Usually just do the standard E build, but I like taking EZ-PZ Dimensional Ripper (the armor + dmg reduction at 4) when enemy has decent frontline or pullers like Garrosh/Stitches. Helps me get out of trouble and makes me feel less worthless.  
  
Deckard: Ruby is a trap. Everything needs to go right for Ruby to work. You need to have your W and ruby up when your team needs it, your team and the enemy needs to be in a good place for mini pots, you need to land your W, your team needs to not die/walk away in the \~1.5s it takes for pots to appear, and then your team needs to actually pick up your mini pots (the hardest part). Shielding pots is better than ruby. Stay a while 20 upgrade is so much better than bottomless. I don’t play lorenado, but from other deckards using it, it’s 20 is also better than bottomless. If against double healer please take emerald 7. So many games are much easier because I’m in a double healer comp and enemy deckard didn’t take emerald 7. Perfect gems 20 with emerald 7 against double healer is nice, but surprisingly doesn’t feel crazy insane and might not be better than stay a while 20. Deckard just has really good 20s.  
  
Malfurion: I have no idea how people who don’t take Revitalize (trait) 13 handle their mana. Malf is such a mana hog till 13. I know you aren’t supposed to spam E but even with modest use I run out so easily.  
  
Tyrande: E1, Elune’s Chosen 4, Moonlit 7, Starfall 10, Harsh Moonlight 13. Idk what this build is, but I go for it basically every game. Maybe it’s the “want to CC but can’t play mark” build. I can’t play mark build. Every time I try mark build I feel bad playing it. Really don’t like having to auto my mark target.  
  
Li Li: MUST take Free Drinks at 1 (for single healer). The thing about Free Drinks is you don’t always need it, but if you need it, you REALLY need it for the 1s cooldown reduction, and you will regret not having it deeply if everyone is at 20% hp 3 minutes into the game. It also prob has the best mana regen of the choices at 1. Not a bad choice even in double healer. Don’t be afraid to use Cleanse at 7 as an instant heal if you need to and rmb you can use it even during jugs. Also Water Dragon is bad, even in double healer. Too reliant on team to follow up and just does nothing too often.  
  
BW: The more I play her, the more I like her kit. Z, her passive heal, critical mist and blink heal work together to make a well-rounded healing setup. I go Greater Poly at 1 (Hyper Shift nerfed too much). Critical Mist at 7 is huge. I ignore the cleanse for the most part and just use it as a big AOE teamfight heal. I have won plenty of teamfights off it. Most of the time your team will have some random slow on them and mist just burst heals everyone for 500+. IMO Emerald Wind is the worst healer ult in the game. This thing has a 20 upgrade that makes it’s CD 5s and it’s somehow still not broken even with the upgrade. It has uses, but the opportunity cost of not taking Blink Heal is way too high. Blink Heal gives BW what she wants - instant single target healing and makes the critical mist play so much better (blink → mist to save ppl).  
  
Whitemane: I just go beam build but occasionally I go against 3 frontline and go AA build (quest 1, with  optional AA4, might try E1 soon). I love AA build Whitemane, and when it works it feels so amazing. I usually go Q7 over Cleanse (I normally go Cleanse on others like Uther and Li Li). I sometimes go Guiding Light 20. Idk if optimal, but it feels good to not have to worry about managing Zeal on someone. Usually take it when the tank runs out of my range often.  
  
Rehgar: I go the typical build E1 Q4 E16, taking Ancestral 10 and 20. I like going W shield on 13 in double healer with no other W talents. Actually reconsidering this, it’s just so much weaker than Q13 that the shield might not be worth. Also like going Trait-7 - wolf them minions to get 1.5cd off Q. Your wolf dmg is super low and not worth risking your position over.  
  
Ana: Triple E build is a trap. E4 is so bad in a vacuum. It lets your E pierce all while in aim down sights and lets it apply doses. E already pierces one in aim down sights untalented, how often do you hit 3+ people with one E even in ARAM? Doses are worthless without Mind-Numbing Doses. E4 needs mind-numbing (I often take both), mind-numbing does not need E4. If you want E7, consider taking Debilitating Dart at 4.

Kael: Post-rework, convection is all the rage in my games. Nearly all the kaels I see in my games go it now. Used to be less than half, now it’s like 90%. Tried it once, got to 40 stacks very carefully, didn’t like it. I’m sticking to mana addict/maybe trait in healerless. Might try convection again if it gets buffed.  
  
Tass: Usually Q1 and Trait7, the one that makes storms when your meter is maxed. Also I prefer Archon over Black Hole, I like the survivability.  
  
Gul’dan: Used to be a W build believer, now experimenting around. Q build looks decent from the 2 times I tried it post rework. Even in full W build, I like Healthstone at 13 for the sudden burst healing to surprise opponents, and even in Q build I like Darkness Within at 16. I don’t trust myself to be able to stay long enough in fights to make Q16 work.  
  
Fenix: Level 1 is Mobile Offense for me, don’t like quest.  
  
Nova (2W-6L): I go One in the Chamber and try to be a standard DPS weaving in autos between abilities. I’ve tried Anti-Armor, but it feels like not enough impact. Prob why I suck with her, but I can’t play Snipe to save my life so yeah.  
  
Hanzo: I love AA Hanzo. Q build feels so bad to play. I miss one arrow and do 0 dmg for the next 4 seconds  
  
Yrel (0W-5L): I may or may not have tried pure healer Yrel in healerless games, going trait 4 and 16 and spamming every ability off CD to heal more. I’m not saying I did, but if I did I would tell you it is terrible.",23,1769756502.0,heroesofthestorm,16,0.81,False

1qqy6w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qqy6w7/searching_for_helpideas_on_the_least_problematic/,Searching for help/ideas on the least problematic way to annoy someone so much they will certainly cut their lease within the next few months.,"TLDR; looking for tips and tricks to annoy someone so much they do not want to continue living with me and will be out of our lease after may. No matter how simple or small. 

Hello all. Sticking to the title, I am seriously looking for ideas on how to severely annoy a roommate without annoying them enough to cause a genuine problem. My partner really wants to try to remain friends with this guy as they grew up together, given roomie in particular had a very rough child hood my partner is very sympathetic towards him and offered him to rent with him as he gets an great deal (his parts only 650 a month)… given my boyfriend’s boss rents out to them. 

My partner is very non-confrontational and really doesn’t want to ruin their “friendship”, which the roommate already claimed ended (his actual words in text messages) when I moved in in may, because HE somehow mistranslated that the rent was going down to $500 and not $650. We had another roommate upon the time who just lost his job and was $150 short of rent, my partner paid for him and allowed him to make it up next payment. Upon my boyfriend receiving the other roommate’s portion a day later, which was $150 short, he simply asked him “where’s the $150?” And the guy threw a NONSENSICAL FIT about it, as if just because we helped the other guy BECAUSE HE ASKED, that magically meant you could pay the same sum as him too?? And than somehow trying to backpedal and say you didn’t know how much it was supposed to be, though you replied “👍” to the group chat message? He seriously told my partner “we are not friends anymore” just because my partner wouldn’t pay that for him when he was perfectly capable of affording himself. Since than, the only times he has really spoke to my partner was asking for help fixing his car/truck. Or flexing other major purchases, IE; Steam deck, xbox x, TWO switches, and a brand new 3ds.

As well when I moved in, his landlord (again, his boss, great guy!) did not want me to sign the lease for a month or two so I was not legally bound here if things for some reason did not work out with my partner. His roommate yet again throws ANOTHER fit about how I’m not legally on the lease yet, and im in his way of using “his” facilities. And was specifically highlighting the bathroom. We are renting in a 3bed with 1 BATH, and at the time their was 4 people in the house!!! 5 if his girlfriend was there!! Now, as well, Mind I add within the whole year I’ve now been here he never takes care of or cleans any of said facilities. The sink is always filled full of him and his girlfriend’s dishes and he/they leaves the kitchen counter a mess every damn time. It’s like cleaning after kids!! 

And now, speaking of said girlfriend, she is here on a biweekly basis. Here one week, gone the next. Every month for the past 4 months. Without fail. Their was mention of her moving in, but she has no vehicle or license and he doesn’t want to full time have to drive her back and forth. Of course my boyfriend doesn’t want to comment on this, but given this guy’s ideology, it’s not fair at ALL that she’s actually using MY facilities that I pay for, or have bought, and is not paying a dime!! And given he was so upset over when I’d have to use the bathroom, it’s even worse that his girlfriend has a bladder disorder so she is ALWAYS in the bathroom!! 

(I rlly don’t care though 🤦‍♀️)

I’ve as well for sure noticed she’s using my expensive shampoos, even putting water in them! When she stays for a week I’ve never once seen ANY hygiene products. I’ve even had to start hiding some of my cleaning products because they kept using them without asking! Same was happening with my boyfriend’s tools (milwaukee tools we’re talking!!!) and he was using them without permission and leaving them sprawled out OUTSIDE. My boyfriend did say something, and at least now, out of the kindness of his heart i guess, he’s started asking permission. 

Now, two times, he has been late on rent in a year. The first time was when our other roommate was staying with us had bought a mustang before he moved out, just a v6. Within the week, after complaining about how broke he was, he goes out and gets a 2017 Ram 1500, no down payment, $800 or more a month. Within the few months of owning it it’s already needing repairs. Flexing harddd that he has a V8 now, but he is the epitome of city boy and has no need for a one ton truck. Parked it within 2 weeks and started driving his honda again because it’s “too expensive for gas”. Honda’s rear end blew up not long after though. 🤦‍♀️🙄 

Now, just Tuesday he texted my boyfriend asking if it was okay if he paid rent the second week of February when he gets paid again as he had to buy “parts for his truck”. Okay, that’s fine. No problem at all! 

TELL ME FUCKING WHY THIS MAN DEAD ASS WALKS IN THE NEXT NIGHT WITH A LOGITECH G920 WHEEL AND SHIFTER!!! $500!!!! And the only “truck part” is a CV AXLE ($100 avg). This is the same guy my boyfriend tried getting to play forza and a few other car games and he got bored within a week and never wanted to play with him (or us) again. I feel it as well speaks volumes that now that he does have a wheel and is “trying to get into it” per say, he has not wanted to play with him. 

I know really all of this sounds kind of petty, but I want this guy OUT without having to be a dick about it. And if I really am being just an asshole, please, enlighten me. My partner has expressed for a long time now he just as well wants this guy out, but is to afraid to ruin their “friendship” and It’s not my place either to do so. 

I really do not understand how last week was NOT my partner’s breaking point with this guy. I was about to leave our house when I could audibly hear the guy yelling in his room at his girlfriend while I was in the kitchen. I could literally hear her hysterically sobbing and couldn’t even make out what she was saying. He was going on along the lines of “just do something”, over and over, it’s all I could hear. I really had to leave so I asked my partner to be nosy for me and just listen through his door (rooms are right across from eachother) and see what’s going on. By the way she was crying, I was worried something happened to her. Low and behold I was actually correct as my partner did in fact hear her say that HE SLAPPED HER, all because \*\*HE\*\* ACCIDENTALLY \*\*MADE HER\*\* spill coffee on his PC. His pc was fine by the way. She was even repeatedly saying “You’re pc is really more important than my face?” 

I’ve discussed this with my partner quite a few times now and honestly he just seems stumped as to what he should do as he really doesn’t want to “hurt” the other guys feelings. He was getting flustered and upset as he seems he’s just kind of afraid to put his foot down. It as well does kind of bother me he wouldn’t stick up for the guys girlfriend after becoming aware of this, but he also has a list of reasons he hates that girl as he as well grew up around her. I’ve heard some really nasty things from a handful of others too. I know it ties down a lot to my boyfriend feeling sympathetic for this grown ass loser with no friends and an abusive family. But I’m tired of this guy taking advantage of my partner for cheap rent, and to as well use him for mechanical repairs. 

Our lease renews in may, his gf was just telling me Tuesday that they are trying to find an apartment together and \*complaining\* about how expensive it is, specifically deposits n such. So clearly it’s already kind of his agenda… just given this rate of financial irresponsibility it sounds like may next year. Soooo, whats some things I can do to ABSOLUTELY ENSURE that he will not renew the lease? For example the only thing i’m doing right now, that for sure seems to realllyy piss him off, is always filling the garbage can slap up to the point he has to take it out. Its literally the only thing I’ve managed to MAKE him do to have a small part in the upkeep of this house. He then will proceed to start slamming shit like a cranky 13yr old after he has to do it. 

Pleaaase endulge me with anything, even if you think it’s too much, or too petty. I’ve had to much going on and have almost a “creative block” and genuinely can not seem to think of anything!! Thanks for reading this all if you did!! ",0,1769755677.0,roommateproblems,1,0.5,False

I take long, slow showers. I watch old movies with the lights turned low. What I do for work is really hectic and occasionally toxic, but I try to not let it get to me. I write in my journal. I drink my tea and savour the taste. Sometimes I stay up late to finish up a book that I got for free on my Kindle, and it makes me feel alive.

We went no contact for most of that time. Recently, I reached out because I had some things I needed to get off my chest. I told her how I felt about her, took accountability for my mistakes in the relationship, wished her the best, and sent what I genuinely meant as a kind goodbye.

She responded very kindly. She said she misses me too, wants the best for me, and mentioned that she wants to see me one more time — that she wants to see the person she was so close with at least once more. I agreed, and we made plans to meet for coffee this Saturday night.

Now I’m really conflicted and anxious.

I don’t know what this meeting is supposed to be. Is it closure? A final goodbye? Something else? Part of me wants to suggest reconciliation, but I’m also terrified of the worst-case scenario and walking away more hurt than I already am.

I still love her deeply. I’ve dreamed about her almost every night since the breakup, and she’s on my mind constantly throughout the day. I know hope can be dangerous, but I can’t fully let go of it yet.

For anyone who’s been in a similar situation:

	•	How should I approach this meeting?

	•	Should I bring up reconciliation or let her lead?

	•	How do I emotionally prepare myself if this really is just goodbye?

I am a male, 27, I moved to Prague almost a year ago and I find it quite nice. I do see myself staying for a long time,but I do have a problem which I would like to have some opinions on.
Loneliness in the big town.
I'm a freelance artist, so I'm not working in a studio setting, I also learn Czech but privately with one more student, so I don't spend time with a lot of people in my work or studies.
I do found myself having friends here,  some of them are closer, some of them are not, but that's ok.
I do want to expand my circle beyond the niche hobby that I do have friends in.
I love coffee,art,working out,books,beer, philosophy, history, science and so on.
Another problem I have is that most of my friends are 35+ and are married, so they can't really help me with meeting new people and especially ladies.
Where would you go,where it's not touristic (I do want to know people who are based around) and where the environment is friendly and welcoming? It's less about me being shy, it's more about how huge is this town, and I don't even know where to go.

Both working corporate jobs, packed schedules, constant deadlines — and only **3 days in hand**.

Their simple request:

>

So we designed a **relaxed Shimla itinerary**, and honestly — their experience might fit you too if time is limited.

🚌 **Day 1: Leaving the Chaos Behind (Delhi → Shimla)**

After office hours, they boarded an **overnight Volvo bus from Delhi**.  
No airport stress, no driving fatigue — just a comfortable overnight journey while the city lights slowly disappeared.

By morning, they were in Shimla, already feeling lighter 🌄

  
🌤️ **Day 2: Action, Calm & Evening City Vibes**

After reaching Shimla, they checked into their hotel, freshened up, and **took proper rest**.  
Instead of rushing out immediately, they chose to start their day slow — something they rarely get to do back home.

Their first outing was to **Annandale Army Museum**.

Here, they didn’t just walk around — they experienced something unique.  
Under the supervision of army personnel, they tried a **guided shooting activity with a real rifle** 🎯.  
They learned **how to aim**, how to hold the weapon, and took turns shooting at targets.  
The experience felt thrilling yet safe — like a real-life action game — and became one of their most talked-about memories.

After the **adrenaline rush**, they wanted peace.

**So** next, they headed to **Advance Study (IIAS)**.  
They walked around the heritage building, sat on the green lawns, talked, laughed, and simply enjoyed the open space 🌿.  
No phones, no rush — just quiet time together.

By evening, they moved towards **Mall Road and The Ridge**.  
They strolled **hand in hand**, explored cafés, had coffee, did a bit of shopping, and watched the sunset paint the sky at The Ridge 🌅.  
The cold breeze and soft lights made the evening feel perfect.

They returned to the hotel relaxed and happy.

  
❄️ **Day 3: Snowy Roads, Valleys & a Peaceful Farewell**

The next morning, they headed towards **Kufri**.  
Here, they enjoyed light adventure activities, took pony rides, and soaked in mountain views 🐎.  
It was playful, fun, and not exhausting — just right for a short trip.

On the way back, they stopped at **Green Valley and Fagu Valley**.  
They slowed down, clicked pictures 📸 and enjoyed the silence that only mountain roads offer.  
This part, they later said, felt the most calming.

As evening approached, they visited **Jakhu Peak**.  
They spent time at the temple, watched the sun slowly disappear behind the hills, and felt a deep sense of peace 🙏.  
It was the perfect way to close their mountain escape.

That night, they boarded an **overnight luxury bus back to Delhi** — refreshed, recharged, and already missing the hills.

  
🌟 If you’re also planning a **short Shimla trip** and don’t want it to feel hectic, this itinerary can work beautifully for you too.

And if you ever need **help with hotels, cabs, Volvo tickets, or a registered local guide in Himachal**, you can always reach out — happy to share genuine, on-ground help 😊🏔️
