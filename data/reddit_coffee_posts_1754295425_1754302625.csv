1mh9ko3,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1mh9ko3/siargao_philippines_a_beautiful_island_to_work/,"Siargao, Philippines: a beautiful island to work remotely","Hey, nomads! I recently went to the Philippines to check out an island that‚Äôs slowly becoming a great spot for remote workers as people are saying it‚Äôs in a growing phase and feels like what Bali was 20 years ago. So let me give you a quick trip report about the Siargao island.

For context, I‚Äôm a digital nomad for 12 years: former web designer but now YouTuber about our lifestyle.

**What I liked**

* **Island vibes.**¬†If you like to be surrounded by palm trees, beaches and hot weather, this is your place. Everyone‚Äôs wearing shorts, sandals and driving scooters. Locals are very chilled. The island is actually bigger than I expected it; there‚Äôs so many cool activities to do on your weekends such as island hopping, or swimming with jellyfish!
* **Surfing.**¬†It‚Äôs definitely one of the best spots in the world to surf, at least, for beginners. There‚Äôs several spots around the whole island, some of them you‚Äôll need a boat to reach which makes it a better experience to connect with more people.
* **Community.**¬†I really loved how tight the community is here, from the locals (which most of them speak fluent english) to the nomad groups. There‚Äôs a lot of events like entrepreneurs meetup, live music gathering, island hopping and even karaoke meetups, they love to sign here.
* **Restaurants.**¬†There‚Äôs a lot of great places to eat here, from delicious filipino food to fancy dinner spots. It‚Äôs also has a bit of the Bali vibes with trendy coffee shops, healthy bowls and many international restaurants.

**What I didn‚Äôt like**

* **Coworking options.**¬†Unfortunately there‚Äôs not many places to cowork, only a small one in town (Alter Space) and a cool one further up north (Coco Space), so you‚Äôd rely more on coffee shops if you like work outsite (tho they either get crowded or it‚Äôs too hot). Or just work from home but then it‚Äôs not easy to find accommodations with good ergonomic chairs.
* **Power cuts.**¬†It‚Äôs not common but make sure your place has a generator as there are times in the month where electricity is just not enough for the island. Luckily there‚Äôs emergency generators now but there‚Äôs was a few nights where there was no communication at all.
* **Cash based.**¬†While there are places that accept card, it‚Äôs still an island that runs by cash. And it might not sound bad but sometimes it‚Äôs a hassle to withdraw money as some ATM run out easily so you gotta rely on companies like Western Union to get money.

**How would I suggest structuring a trip to Siargao?**

I‚Äôd book a place on the General Luna area, where most foreigners are staying, book a scooter for the month, and slowly explore the restaurants and coffee shops. I‚Äôd contact local surf companies to get a surfboard and go surf most mornings before the work day starts!

Then head out to the nomad meetups to meet people right away. If you have time to go this September, there‚Äôs a annual digital nomad conference (Nomads in Paradise) where you can easily network and explore the island together.

‚Äî

Lastly, the big question about Siargao is the internet reliability, and its getting better nowadays as most places are using Starlink as a backup. But you gotta understand that it‚Äôs an island as sometimes the internet won‚Äôt be that strong, there will be power cuts and it will be very hot to be working on open spaces.

But overall, it‚Äôs such a beautiful place to be and work at, and I‚Äôm so glad that the island it‚Äôs getting more traction as the locals are one of the most happiest people that I‚Äôve met.

I actually made a full documentary on¬†[my YouTube channel where I explain everything about Siargao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEEQwPUNoTU), while I also shared the cost of living for a month at the end.

Hope you get to visit this island as well!",1,1754302599.0,digitalnomad,0,1.0,False

He's chronically ill. And I understand that. That's why I have no complaints doing EVERYTHING in the house. I cook my food (only mine because he doesn't seem to want to, so he just buys his own), do the household chores, yeah, like a mom would. 

However... My dad has been in and out of hospitals. For the same freakin reasons. I'm so tired understanding him. Because its very preventable. I told him multiple times to NOT drink softdrinks, coffee, whatnot. And also not to eat those he knows are not allowed. (He is diabetic and has stage 5 CKD). 

I have an older sister, and after getting a job, first thing she did was to move out. I know how taxing things are for her too, because my dad keeps on pressuring her to.. well, have kidney transplant and whatnot. He also tells her how to use her OWN money. So I understand she left. And from what I can see, she's finally starting to live her own life. But that means the responsibility all falls on me now.

I tried to tough it out. My sister actually wants me to also move out with her, but I refused. I do love my dad, and knowing he's very sick, I didn't want to leave him alone. But now... I don't know anymore. I want to live my own life too, but it's hard when I hear my dad vomiting, just being sick, etc.. I really want him to get well, but it seems he himself has given up. However, I feel like I HAVE to do something for him. 

(also, we are very poor so it's hard to be hospitalized. and honestly atp hes been hospitalized like what, 5 times? for the same reasons. even hospitals can't help him)

I need advice on what I should do right now. Also, since I'm still a minor, it doesn't seem like he takes me seriously.. I'm also diagnosed with depression so honestly it's super tough. I feel like anytime I might just... you know.",1,1754302467.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We had a scheduled boarding time of 2pm.  When we got to the airport  we were taken to a staging hotel to wait.  We assumed that we would be taken to the port for our boarding time.  Instead we just had time to have a coffee and then taken to the port hours before our check in time.  We were all asked to get off the busses and stand out in the rain.  For the whole time we were looking at the busses parked in the parking lot.

I was contacted today by the ships guest services and was informed ""Celebrity was not responsible and the port was understaffed"".  It was Celebrity handling the airport transfers, with personnel wearing Celebrity uniforms.

It was Celebrity that was responsible for the lack of co-ordination.  ",2,1754302221.0,celebritycruises,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúBefore you go to bed, Alex, I must ask something of you.‚Äù Carbon had adopted a quiet voice when they were at the bunk-end of their room whenever it was something she wanted to keep private, like their relationship.

Both of them had, actually. Alex followed her lead. He wasn‚Äôt sure if she actually had any more experience with intelligence related things, but Carbon sure acted like she did so he went with it. Being willing to tap into a veteran's experience was a skill that was considered essential in the Scoutship program, and he had picked that up.

There was something in her tone this time, though. ‚ÄúYeah, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù

She reached into her robe and pulled a folded up sheet of paper from her Tsla‚Äôo made sports bra, and held it out to him. ‚ÄúWilliams noticed some strange items included in the most recent equipment shipment to the depot that were not on the manifest. We agree that there are too many things here that appear related for this to be accidental, particularly on an expedition with such a high level of security attached.‚Äù

Alex perused it and did not think about how warm the paper felt or where it had been hidden. Not for very long, anyway. ‚ÄúThat is a lot of beryllium. It‚Äôd have to be used as an alloy though?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect, most applications I have ever seen have been as alloys. Usually in reactor parts or plasma handling systems. Sometimes tools.‚Äù Carbon took a seat on her bed and laid down, hands folded over her stomach, as she did when she was thinking about something that was bothering her. ‚ÄúWe have plenty of other metals to produce those alloys with. We even have a small amount of beryllium as an additive specifically for that purpose, a 250 gram cylinder. What was sent today could potentially produce hundreds of kilograms in an alloy, which is an amount that almost does not make sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the usual percentage?‚Äù Alex knew almost nothing about metallurgy.

A little shrug. ‚ÄúFour is the highest I have seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that would be hundreds of kilos. Presumably they want less than that, though, or have some high percentage use in mind. What the fuck would they do with a hundred kilos of metal? With *ten*, for that matter? It‚Äôd take hours to print a single kilogram object out of metal with the setup we have, right?‚Äù It wouldn‚Äôt be very subtle. Someone would have to load the bag into the machine, too.

He hated this spy shit so much. There was some distant whisper in his head that said this could all just be a little oopsy on Logistics end of things, but the rest of him was *mad* about it because there was no way they fucked up that much. He resented ONI for dragging him into this, again, even if he was to blame for falling in love. Alex gritted his teeth and his jaw worked silently as he resented them yet more for making him think that.

Carbon reached out and set a gentle hand on his leg, the only part of him she could reach from where she was laying. ‚ÄúYes, I would say five to six hours per kilogram printed, on each machine. There are too many possible paths to go down at the moment. Which is why we are initially going to restrict their potential uses by making them disappear.‚Äù

Alex took a deep breath and calmed himself down, as difficult as that felt to do. ‚ÄúPut them in the lake? I‚Äôm sure the marines would love the chance to blow a hole in the ice. Yeah, they don‚Äôt have explosives, but I‚Äôm sure one of them knows some MacGyver shit for just such a situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh- no, that would be very obvious.‚Äù Carbon seemed alarmed by that suggestion, sitting up on her elbow, bright blue eyes wide. ‚ÄúWe are going to hide them in the *Hoku*- The *Hokule‚Äôa‚Äôs*... The space frame of the *Hokule‚Äôa*. There is plenty of excess padding in the depot that has not been recycled yet, so nothing will move around in the frame. Items can be brought up and hidden away with none but us knowing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, that is less fun but much more stealthy.‚Äù Alex chewed on the plan. They‚Äôd have the wings on tomorrow, and he would finally get to work on something he was *actually* qualified for. ‚ÄúI can probably extend the systems checks and shakedown for a day, day and a half, maybe. Think that‚Äôll be enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetween that and my commitment to ensuring that the only large craft we have is as close to functionally perfect as possible, that will do.‚Äù She smiled and patted his leg. ‚ÄúWe will start once the hangar has fewer people in it. Tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.‚Äù

Alex took a seat beside her. ‚ÄúGuess I should switch to clothes as well. Not many places to hide things in the e-suits.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Williams and Zenshen fared well today, I will be switching over tomorrow as well. As long as the weather remains *just* cold.‚Äù Carbon smiled and laughed softly, sliding an arm around his side and pulling herself over to snuggle against his back.

‚ÄúSpeaking of Williams... Am I supposed to know about what we‚Äôre talking about here?‚Äù He slipped her hand into his, their fingers laced together.

‚ÄúI asked if I could bring you in and she agreed. It is the three of us that know about this plan, no more.‚Äù Carbon gave his hand a squeeze.

If they were somewhere with a public wireless network, Alex would be concerned about his wetware uploading logs and all of this becoming ONI knowledge, which could then be communicated back to *whoever* on this side of the portal. But they weren‚Äôt, and the ONI team that set his system up was sufficiently paranoid as to not allow it to upload on *any* military networks. There was no workaround for when he was here hiding in the code, according to the Empire Intel team that had pored over a copy of the software. Alex didn‚Äôt know what part of the Navy owned the comms running back through the portal, but it was currently fully isolated from the Solanet, which meant no less-secure access points. The r_probe system would have nowhere to upload the data to.

It made sense, to an extent. Civilians are welcome to transmit as much as they want on civilian networks. Military personnel and civilian contractors such as himself were actively told not to upload anything while they were on duty unless it was work related. A massive data package routed to a site on the Solanet - meaning that it was leaving secured military networks - would be highly suspicious. Sure, eventually ONI would say it was theirs and to leave it alone. But the likelihood is that IT would capture a big chunk of the data as evidence and some already overworked sergeant would have tracked Alex down and read him the riot act well before that happened, and then a big pile of unsecured people would know that something was amiss with the computer lodged in his head.


But all of that made it look like ONI wanted to keep it secret from the rest of the Navy. Otherwise they could just slap a header on it that said ‚Äòthis belongs to ONI: no girls allowed‚Äô and let nature take its course. Then the Empire would have uploaded their possibly self-aware intrusion package onto an obviously ONI-owned network, not whatever KOM was.

Alex *really* hated all this spy shit. He was not that guy.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm on board. Anything else you want to talk about? I feel like I‚Äôve got a big day ahead tomorrow, finally getting to flex what I was sent back to do.‚Äù Alex said, and then got no response. He looked down, Carbon already snoozing. ‚ÄúGuess it can wait until the morning, then.‚Äù

He got her tucked into bed and really thought hard about joining her for the night. Even if it didn‚Äôt include any other activities, it would be nice to enjoy her presence again. Alex closed her privacy shutters, despite the handful of reasons he was inventing to prove why it‚Äôd be OK to secretly snuggle with his wife when they were supposed to *not* be doing that, then climbed into his bunk and let anxiety about this new information gnaw on his guts for a while before slipping into a restless unconsciousness.

Alex hauled himself out of bed too early, still tired despite having gotten a solid seven hours of sleep. Stopped at the beverage dispenser for a coffee *before* going to the bathroom, and started his day with the unpleasant flavor combination of spearmint toothpaste and black coffee.

Everybody liked his winter gear, at least. Carbon in particular approved of the vibrant red lining in the jacket though she was less a fan of the ceramic white outer shell. The system was polychromatic, he could change it later. With a thermal base layer and technical fleece under the latest in insulation and self-heating systems, the system was good to -40 for 48 hours, and he still looked like he had just walked off the street on a chilly day.

Of course, everyone else was still wearing equipment issued by their respective militaries, except for Abbot. He had an anorak fit for an arctic expedition a hundred years ago and still seemed a bit chilled.


After breakfast, Alex parked himself at the hangar and waited for them to give him the go ahead to start working on the shuttle‚Äôs systems. It was much faster than he had expected, and more interesting to watch as well. Attaching the wings was semi-automatic, a pair of forearm-thick screws pulling the wing assembly into the box on the fuselage, though manual work was required to finish the job properly.

Carbon let him go after the second wing was on, with the caveat he not do anything involving the wings or drives until he was told they were cleared. He knew not to do that, she knew that he did too, but it was a defensible thing to be heard saying. Don‚Äôt light anybody on fire or slap them in the head with a moving part, OK?

He burned up almost three hours with a basic sensor config test and recalibrations on a few individual sensors. Maybe he *could* stretch this out for two days.

After lunch - and a good-natured warning not to take the shuttle out without clearance from Williams - he was alone in the hangar fiddling with the control surfaces and their related wiring when there was a knock at the door.

That was weird, he didn‚Äôt think there was any expectation of privacy in a shuttle that seats eight. Except in the head, but the tight confines somewhat precluded actual privacy in there anyway. He glanced out the window, Zheng and Amalu standing there, both with several hardsided cases. Probably not the first delivery of parts to stash, unless the conspiracy had gotten bigger without anyone letting him know.

‚ÄúCome on in!‚Äù He hollered over his shoulder. It was already unlocked.

Zheng pulled the door down and came up halfway, just sticking her head through the entry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to set up some inspection drones to check the shuttle‚Äôs structure post-construction, just to get a deeper look at the material integrity. I‚Äôm pretty sure nothing was damaged and Carbon is too, she just wants to be sure - it is our only shuttle, after all.‚Äù 

That sounded familiar. 

‚ÄúSure, go ahead. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be getting around to the engines until tomorrow. Trying to track down some lag in the pilot‚Äôs stick right now and it‚Äôs not too clear where the issue is.‚Äù It was ‚Äòonly‚Äô a half of a second, and ‚Äòonly‚Äô on the port side, but it wasn‚Äôt present on the copilot‚Äôs stick at all. ‚ÄúAnd since it is our only shuttle, I better have all the kinks worked out.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you think it‚Äôs a hardware problem, I‚Äôll be glad to take a look at it.‚Äù Zheng said before disappearing to set up the drones with Amalu, the door slowly closing on its hydraulics.

Alex was starting to think it was a hardware problem. There‚Äôd be a real simple way to test that out, though, and it started with shutting the controls down all the way to the breakers and getting the little tool kit stashed in the overhead storage. He‚Äôd just swap the sticks. The entire flight control system and instrumentation were modular, after all.

He‚Äôd do that after he checked the manual to make sure that it *was* modular, anyway. He was not about to rip apart a system he couldn‚Äôt just snap back together, because his wife or her Human co-worker would be the one fixing it and he‚Äôd never hear the end of that.

The alarm he set on his comm marking the end of the day buzzed some hours later, letting him know that it was time to stop doing something he knew he would get lost in... although cramming himself into the footwell under the console to get at that last bolt tightened up was not something he was eager to keep doing, but it was finally done. The testing could wait for the morning.

Since everything was powered off, there wasn‚Äôt much left to secure and he pulled his jacket back on before leaving. It was comfortable in the shuttle, and merely chilly in the hangar, so there was plenty of time to get his gloves on and hood up before returning to the real cold of the outdoors.

In addition to the drones hovering slowly over the fuselage, humming and beeping as they scanned, Amalu was still here. Leaning on the wall and staring out of the small window on the pedestrian door, arms crossed over his chest and looking somewhat pensive.

‚ÄúSpecialist. Keeping watching?‚Äù Alex enquired as he approached the younger Tsla‚Äôo.

He jumped like Alex had just popped out of a ventilation duct to eat his brain. ‚ÄúN-no, k-‚Äù He coughed, a burst of steam in the air, catching himself before he said something inappropriate. ‚ÄúJust- I have a question to ask, and I think you are...‚Äù

He paused here, squinting and looking off into the snow again, thinking very hard about what he was about to say. ‚ÄúI think you are the most likely to answer me honestly and not make fun of me for asking.‚Äù

That felt kind of good and also made him feel bad for Amalu. Crenshaw did strike Alex as a guy who would take a joke a little too far, and those two had been hanging out a lot. *Hopefully* it was just Crenshaw. ‚ÄúHey, if it‚Äôs an earnest question, I will always act in confidence.‚Äù

Amalu grimaced and gave him a sidelong glance, nodding slowly. ‚ÄúI have heard some people talking about a particular set of credentials that I am not familiar with. Do you know what the Harkness exam is? Where would I take that?‚Äù

Alex stared at him, momentarily losing track of the expression his face was making. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúAll right, that‚Äôs not- That- the translation... Who did you hear that from?‚Äù

1mh9bcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1mh9bcq/covertvulnerable_narc_when_does_it_get_better/,Covert/vulnerable narc. When does it get better?!,"We broke up 5 years ago. And I‚Äôve been in emotional hell ever since. When we first met, I had no idea - he was really shy and introverted I thought, my friends thought he was quiet too! Works for the ambulance, so a good guy definitely? Little did I know‚Ä¶

After the initial discard (I told him to stop being negative - blocked on everything until he is told I‚Äôm out on a date and I get an email) we get chatting again, second discard - Facebook official with a new man. 2 years go by - the new man likes me on Hinge, so I know he‚Äôs single again - I ended up reaching out and then the hell starts again. We got speaking all day every day, texting morning until night. I obviously haven‚Äôt moved on at this point because I‚Äôm so traumatised from the discard - sure he knows that! Sometimes he‚Äôd reply warmly like nothing ever happened and other times he‚Äôd ignore me completely, even when we were together he would use silence to punish me. I asked him if he‚Äôd like to go on a date, that was it then I was making him uncomfortable even though 1) he‚Äôs my ex and 2) we had been chatting all day every day again, but obviously I apologised and took the blame for everything, as if I‚Äôd made it up.

We would text for hours and suggest watching the same film and texting through it, ordering the same takeaway, having phone calls. Even talked about bringing his dog over and going for coffee. Then he‚Äôd go cold and ghost me for months.

The whole thing made me feel insane. Like I imagined the entire connection.

Every time he did come back around, it gave me this false hope. And it‚Äôs taken me years to realise that he fed off that? Maybe he enjoyed feeling wanted.

My most recent discard (November 24) I had my phone robbed at an event, we had been texting a lot so I let him know that if he had text I hadn‚Äôt seen it as my WhatsApp wasn‚Äôt backed up. He was so incredibly rude to me / told me he hadn‚Äôt text me, he‚Äôs busy, I‚Äôm not his mum and he doesn‚Äôt have to check in with me every day or owe me anything?! Wtf‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt respond with my usual begging and I said that was a bit of a reach and deleted his number. He then blocked me on TikTok (I didn‚Äôt even follow him I just noticed he wasn‚Äôt in my messages anymore as we had sent eachother TikToks in the past) and then he changed his number before I could even get proper closure which is why I messaged him on my other account (we had already spoken on it before) just to say what I needed to say so I could finally move on:

It wasn‚Äôt begging. It was literally just:

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm not expecting a reply or anything like that. I‚Äôve just been doing a lot of therapy around self-worth and abandonment issues. One thing I was encouraged to do was say the things I‚Äôd been holding onto so I can finally feel at peace with it. That‚Äôs all this is.

I‚Äôm sorry for how I came across at times. I held onto the idea that maybe one day things would be different or that we could be on good terms, or even friends again, and because of that, I didn‚Äôt let go when I should have.

It took me a long time to realise I‚Äôd let how you saw me shape how I saw myself, and I think that‚Äôs why I kept trying.

This isn‚Äôt to make things weird or ask for anything. I just didn‚Äôt want to keep carrying the shame and embarrassment I‚Äôve been holding onto. I‚Äôm ready to leave it behind and move forward? hopefully with no hard feelings. Hope you‚Äôre good.‚Äù

He read it and blocked me instantly.

I‚Äôve spoken to my therapist about all of this because I‚Äôm truly embarrassed of my behaviour and my self esteem has been severely impacted. I genuinely believe he‚Äôs a covert or fragile narcissist:

‚Ä¢	Withdraws emotionally during any moment of closeness

‚Ä¢	Punishes you with silence rather than expressing his needs

‚Ä¢	Believes he‚Äôs the victim, even when he‚Äôs the one ghosting or deactivating

‚Ä¢	Never gives full closure - just disappears and blames you for reacting

‚Ä¢	Refuses accountability and reframes you as the ‚Äúintense‚Äù one

‚Ä¢	Can‚Äôt tolerate any kind of emotional depth without pulling away

He used to say things like, ‚ÄúEvery man has always walked out on me,‚Äù which used to make me feel sorry for him. But he probably sabotaged every one of those relationships too

He accused me of lying about everything, even what I ate because ‚Äúyou lie about what you eat so I eat and get fat and then nobody else will want me.‚Äù‚Ä¶ in fact There were so many accusations. He constantly accused me of cheating, even before we had met (red flag on my end for not realising how this was gonna go but I know why through therapy and my inner child work). Got mad when I was best friends with someone on Snapchat. I‚Äôd deleted some old messages and that set him off. I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but I was just sick of the constant accusations. But the reaction was crazy, he ripped his hair out and kept it to show me what I had done. I was anxious being in the car in case I missed a direction, doing anything in bed as I was degraded and humiliated etc. my hair was even falling out at one point.

I honestly feel like I‚Äôve aged 10 years. I still think about the intimacy. About the good moments. But I also remember walking on eggshells, constantly worrying I‚Äôd say the wrong thing and he‚Äôd disappear again.

It‚Äôs been 5 fucking years. And I still miss someone who treated me like this. I‚Äôm working so hard to break this trauma bond.

1mh99rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutInCoffee/comments/1mh99rl/the_outin_story/,The OutIn Story,"OutIn was born from a simple desire: to enjoy high-quality coffee in the great outdoors. Imagine reaching the top of a mountain after hours of climbing or sitting by a campfire under a starry sky. In these moments of achievement and reflection, nothing completes the experience like a perfect cup of freshly brewed coffee. But until now, these special moments often meant settling for less. Why should the quality of your coffee be limited by your location?

OutIn is here to break that barrier. We bring the perfect cup of coffee to you, wherever you are‚Äîwhether you're outdoors on an adventure or enjoying the comforts of home.

At OutIn, we blur the lines between ‚Äú**Out**‚Äù and ‚Äú**In**‚Äù through coffee. More than a drink, it‚Äôs a ritual of joy, a source of comfort, and a bridge to connection.Every cup sparks conversations, fuels energy, and transforms the everyday into the extraordinary. With each sip, we celebrate the courage to dream, the drive to grow, and the power of meaningful connections.Our mission is to bring this joy into your life, empowering you to push boundaries and embrace new adventures. OutIn isn‚Äôt just about coffee - it‚Äôs about fueling the extraordinary, one cup at a time.

At OutIn, we live by three core principles, guided by our philosophy of **NoBoundaries**:

1. **Activate Inner Power:** Your creativity and passion shouldn't be limited by your location. OutIn breaks the boundary between ‚Äúindoor‚Äù and ‚Äúoutdoor,‚Äù allowing you to tap into your full potential wherever you are.
2. **Transcend Outer Noise:** The world can be overwhelming, and the daily grind often leaves us drained. OutIn offers a simple escape: pause, savor the moment, and enjoy a hot espresso, grounding you in the present.
3. **Explore Infinite Possibilities:** Life is full of adventures, big and small. Stepping out of your comfort zone often brings the greatest rewards. OutIn is the perfect companion for an active lifestyle, ensuring that quality coffee always comes along for the ride.

OutIn is more than just a coffee maker, it‚Äôs a belief in limitless potential. We‚Äôre redefining ""boundaryless living,"" rejecting the false choice between comfort and adventure, quality and portability. Every perfect cup brewed at altitude, every coffee shared in the wilderness, every morning ritual maintained while camping, these are victories against limitations.

OutIn users are part of a global community united not by demographics, but by shared values: life‚Äôs too short for bad coffee, adventure doesn‚Äôt require sacrificing quality, and the boundaries we accept as real are just suggestions waiting to be challenged.

We believe that by refusing to accept limitations, you don‚Äôt just change your own life, you inspire others to do the same. Welcome to OutIn, where every cup is perfect, every moment is possible, and every boundary is just a suggestion.

Not good at sentenses so here is a list of how it affected me and my AuDHD (inatentive)

# Positives:

The noise in my head is gone

Im able to read a whole wikipedia article or page without skimming, reading from the bottom or feeling a very strong urge to do something else.

No interest in social media.. opened up instagram and didnt feel a thing so closed it. Screen time in general is way down!

Watched a whole movie last night and just sat there watching it.. no fidgeting at all. Can remember the whole movie which is rare for me!

I feel very present.. laid down on the grass yesterday looking at the leaves of a tree and the clouds moving and just excisted in the moment.. was beautiful.

Not really any desire to drink alcahol which is great as I drank quite a lot previously.

My anxiety or anxiety as I used to have it has gone. The only anxiety like feeling I have now is more of an excited anxeity rather than bad anxiety.. especially when thinking of tasks to do.

I dont feel the dread/overwhelm feeling when initiating tasks.

My word recall is great! Was out walking in the woods and had no trouble remembering the names of all the plants which I usually struggle with.

Talking is a lot easier. The words flow better and I stay on my train of thought a lot better.

Have made much healtier food choices the past few days.

Wouldnt have had the patiece to write this list before or would have got frustrated and overthinked it.

# Negatives:

It feels a bit rushy/come up'y in the first couple of hours which dies down eventually... not terrible but feels a bit manic.

Had a migrane in the first hour of taking and feel like i almost got one on a couple of other days.

I crash pretty hard around 9pm and have been going to bed around 10pm which is unusal.. not sure if this is a bad thing or not as I sleep well. Im not really irritable.. just tired.

My appetite has vanished. Feel like I need to force food down.

My blood pressure has decreased which is interesting as I though it would increase. Maybe being less stressed has helped.

Im craving coffee pretty badly but thats expected as I only gave up last week

# Conclusion/TLDR:

Feels great so far but know its early days but the positives vastly outweigh the negatives and excited to see how it affects my work and productivity this week.",1,1754301100.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False
1mh95o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/1mh95o5/with_context_does_anyone_think_water_attacks/,"With context, does anyone think water attacks should have been designed to act as Freeze?","Recently, I have managed to make sense of someone's patch on Discord that restores the Brain Stone's intended function, and have been wondering if an Enraged Fire Plugs' gigantic blast of water should act as a multi-target version of Freeze.  Here are the reasons why:

1. Other PSI powers have equivalent attacks that act as them, minus the PP costs.  Fire has several different moves, two of which are particularly worth noting, Flash has a glorious light, Thunder has a crashing boom bang attack, Hypnosis has such moves as a haunting melody and a Tangoo's pipe, Paralysis has such moves as a mysterious electric field, and Brainshock has such moves as something very mysterious and maniacal laughter (as I managed to dig up in ebsrc).
2. One attack that acts as PSI Fire is when a Scalding Coffee Cup splashes you with its coffee.  Obviously, coffee is not fire itself, but a hot water-based substance.  If hot (modified) water can act as ""fire"", then wouldn't it stand to reason that cold water from a fire hydrant should act as ""ice"", like in, say, Chrono Trigger?  (For that matter, what exactly is an extinguishing blast supposed to be, that a Demonic Petunia is capable of as its equivalent to Fire gamma?)
3. One other attack, a Soul-Consuming Flame's flaming fireball, targets only one character rather than your whole party, but still checks the target's Fire resistance.  If one particular attack can follow its own independent instructions from the same-element PSI power, then shouldn't the opposite power be allowed to have something similar?

If a blast of water in Earthbound were to check for Freeze resistance and be able to solidify each target, though, then just yesterday, it has dawned on me whether or not such moves in Mother 3 should work similarly as a tidal wave from the Osohe Snake, a whirlpool from Master Eddy, or an Unwelcome Gust's water spout, even though those that fight the first two of those are already underwater for those battles.

(Before anyone brings this up, I'm willing to let explosives slide for dropping the Fire element between Earthbound Zero and Earthbound, since they gain their own element in Mother 3, even though one of its first few cutscenes involves a bomb, with the same design as the kind you can obtain much later on, setting actual fire to Sunshine Forest.)

Anyone have any thoughts on all that?",1,1754301073.0,earthbound,0,1.0,False

Ok so this is not something to attack anyone, i am highlighting my(23M) top 3 worst interaction with teacher it doesn't mean the male teachers were great most of the male teachers i knew or know were assholes, and sexists, the word Teacher to be honest is a cuss for me well lower than that i don't respect them and might never respect them in future too if i am able to heal, I know i am going to be downvoted to hell for this, or even abused in my dm's honestly i don't care anymore, this profession is nothing but dumbasses(man amd women) with their heads up their asses, i have come accross some who are geniunely in love with this profession but honestly, they have been far too less, i have changed 16 school, so i do speak with experience, on this one, and honestly i am on a rant cause i havent slept once ounce cause my brain decided to bring up the nightmares today, 

I was 9 in 4th class an midsession admision a month after the mid therm exams, i was having problem with english subject, and my parents with there infinite wisdom(/s) asked my school english teacher for tution cause i was really bad, i never felt comfortable with her i begged my parents to not to sent me there, they didn't hear, 3 months, that how long this 38 years old women SAed me, i didn't know what was happening to me, i was scared and it used to be punishment for my mistake, she threatened me to not tell about this otherwise she will do this to my younger brother and that was enough to make me stay silent, i hated my self and tried to be good, but every da it happened for one reason or other, finally dad got transfered after just 5 months of posting in that city,

2nd was in 5th class almost 7 months after the 1st incident, I have a very bad relation with touch specially uninformed one, only person who can touch me is my brother, and i think mom didn't notice me not hugging her anymore, or sleeping awayt from them in a different room/ bed, they thought i was growing up, this was a bit latish admission after summer holidays, it is my 4th day and i have asked the teacher a few question as i haven't ever been taught in previous school, she called me to solve one of the sums, as she thought i was wasting time, and when i couldn't she said and i quate her word for word, ""You are wasting your parents money, as you are going to end up as a labourer""

and 3rd one this one broke the last shread of bond b/w me and my parents, the more they sided with the teacher the more they lost their son, I was in 10 and recently grew the gairs, there was no written rule against it in the rule book,so i did not cut them as they were the only thing i liked about myself atp,  and in the last PTM she had an argument with my mom, about something as i was outside, and she targeted me time to time, she had told me that she will cut my hair if i don't  get myself. and she followed up on the promise next day, she called me in the front and from behind grabed my hairs and tery to cut them i struggled as i was skinny, and in deffence i pushed her on the floor and then all hell broke she draged me to the principal by hairs and slapping me, breaking a bangle on my face making a cut, my parents were called, i really thought they will side with me, they didn't, they just apologised on my behaf and buzzed my hair, to 0mm,, i cried that day for one of the last time, next day as i was suspended for attacking a teacher i was suspended they wanted to resticate me but dad got it settled with suspension, i passed that school with 60 internal marks out of 100, and a total of 438, left my house for JEE, i hate what happened to me, 

Many a times i dream about the 4thclass teacher still there and sometimes about the scissor entering my neck, wake up in cold sweat, and its more frequent as i live here with my parent's cause they have the audacity to pretend that i am distant and cutting from them, like they did no wrong, today was the knife dream everyone was clapping, including parents, Still learning how to be okay being touched, even by people I care about. Still trying to repair my fractured relationship with my parents who honestly, I still don‚Äôt trust fully. I know i am not here for your sympathyies i just want to know if it changes every, if you ever heal I am in therapy, but it has been only 4 sessions now.

So when I see people online say ‚Äúnot all men,‚Äù I cringe. I really do. Because when women say they‚Äôre scared of men, I get it. I genuinely do. Because I‚Äôm scared of women. I know it‚Äôs not fair. I know it‚Äôs not all of them. But trauma doesn‚Äôt care about fairness. It just builds walls.

So my friend (F 27), I'll just call her Mia for this, is chronically ill. I'm not sure exactly what she's been diagnosed with other than just type 1 diabetes though. But because of her being diabetic, shes been in and out of the hospital since me and my girlfriend (F 28) met her a little over a year and a half ago. It's been becoming more frequent though with it now her getting DKA at least once a month and needing an ambulance ride there. There have been a few times where we nearly found her dead at her apartment or where she'd call my girlfriend and have her call parametrics foe her because she couldn't communicate properly to the 911 operator. My girlfriend has worked in medical before as a CNA some years back and it's become routine now and snaps into caregiver mode.

Because of her health she wasn't able to care for her dog like she used too. Her dog was getting neglected, even if it wasnt purposeful. After we didn't hear from her for a few days and her mother contacted us asking if we'd heard from her, we went over and found her nearly dead. Got her to a hospital, but told her after we'd take the dog to live with us and she can still be in Mias life and she can visit her whenever. She agreed and was thankful for us taking her in. 

Shortly after we told her we can care for her dog, we had a serious discussion with Mia about everything. She had been kind of trying to push my girlfriend into a caregiver role rather than just friends and we wanted to set firm boundaries on that. We did not want to blur those lines and we didn't have the means to be able to be caregivers. I noticed it starting to happen early on, my girlfriend has a heart of gold and tries to help anyone and everyone she can. Unfortunately people sometimes take advantage of that, so I wanted to nip that in the butt before it started and she agreed. We asked Mia to look for more resources and maybe look into getting a case worker. She's already on disability and SNAP but it's not enough for her and she agreed and that was that, we thought. This was probably around... a year ago now?

So now, fast forward to the beginning of last June, I'm working at my job and my girlfriend and Mia hanging out together. After work, I get a call from my girlfriend. I don't recall exactly what she said but basically Mia broke down saying she doesn't think she'll live for much longer and she's also being evicted from her apartment. Most of what they discussed is still unknown to me but ultimately, without my involvement on it, it was decided that Mia was going to move in with us. Mind you, my girlfriend isn't even supposed to be living with me right now because she isn't even on the lease. The landlord just sent me an email discussing back payments for missed rent about a week prior to this and ended it in a vaguely threatening way saying that their aware my girlfriend is living with me. Not only that, but its a 500sqft studio and we already had a cat and now also Mia's dog living with us AND I'm the only one who has full employment (yay job market!).

I argued with my girlfriend and was just trying to figure out if there was any other option that we have but she said no. She doesn't have any other friends as far as we're aware, and her parents are useless. Her sister and her still talk occasionally but we don't know what their relationship is like outside of a once a month phone call and she also lives a few states away. She also hasn't informed her family of her health and how she believes she's going to die soon though. This is not something I have yet to discuss with Mia directly about because frankly, we aren't as close. But a part of me feels like she should at least tell her sister and father.

A few days after all of that, she moved in officially, on my birthday of all days. This was after asking DAILY she can move in yet and when can she move in. Saying stuff on how she doesn't know when they're going to kick her out and how she can't even drink the water at her apartment because it had legionnaires disease in it (never once got proof of that, also, how are your neighbors perfectly fine then?). She swore she'd do her best to help out with chores and finances and so far the contrary has happened. Dishes haven't been done. She leaves food out constantly so the dog gets into it. She never picks up her trash, so I'm always cleaning up after her. My kitchen is just unusable because of how filthy it's gotten. She's also done serious damage to my floor and has put so many holes in my walls.

The floor damage happened 2 weeks ago where she told us she got food poisoning somehow and was vomiting, drank not one, but SIX electrolyte drinks we bought for her in the span of an hour and proceeded to vomit all of that back up everywhere. I still don't understand why she did that. I have emetophobia so I just left the apartment in a panic. In the meantime, my girlfriend called an ambulance to have her picked up because it was a deeply concerning amount. Apparently she vomits frequently, but oddly enough it's only happened when I'm at work... No idea whats causing that but my girlfriend said it was never that much so thats why she called parametrics. She also decided to use whatever she could find to 'clean' the vomit, primarily consisting of me and my girlfriends clothes, to shove into random corners all over the apartment where she vomited. 

My girlfriend wasn't aware she used whatever was near to 'clean' it up and thought she got it all cleaned up by the time Mia left. My girlfriend had a previously planned trip to go on, so she left for about a week the next morning. I kept finding puke covered clothing, towels, trash, you name it, everywhere in that apartment for that whole time I was alone. I felt extremely uncomfortable being there and because it was just the electrolyte drinks, it didn't really smell at all which made it difficult to find. I now have multiple black stains of wood damage in my floor from it. 

I've given up asking her to do literally any chores at this point, because everytime I ask, there is always an excuse on why she can't. Both me and my girlfriend have talked privately together about how she uses a lot of medical knowledge and terminology she has over my girlfriend, so when asked to do something she'll use that to her advantage and if you disagree she'll get all upset, sometimes cry about it. So it's made it very difficult to call out any bullshit because we just don't have the knowledge to distinguish between true or false things on her multiple, uncommon disabilities hyper specific symptom. The one thing I have said she needs to do, is feed and water the cat and dog, once at both 9 am and 9 pm. I know for a FACT she can do this. All day she is always messing around with something that requires way more energy than feeding and watering the animals. She has continuously neglected doing it though. Me and my girlfriend have come back home so many times to finding out the cat and dog haven't been fed and that their water dishes have been empty. The animals have gone a few times without water for 1 day and a half because she'd lie saying shes done so.

One of the worst issues is the lack of privacy me and my girlfriend have. To help alleviate that, we literally tried to split the room in half with furniture. While it helps a little, it's still a very small space not meant for 3 people and 2 pets to live in. Before moving in, she said she would leave the apartment and go do something for the day so we can have some private time together. She's only left a total of 3 times since moving in almost 2 months ago. She doesn't leave. This has caused some serious strain on me and my girlfriends relationship lately. We've been having some unrelated issues here and there but this has made it worse. 

Mia also has this thing where when I leave for work, she'll have a crying episode every night (I work overnights) across the coffee table from my girlfriend, and no matter what my girlfriend does, she's inconsolable. She'll just sit there and cry for hours making my girlfriend extremely uncomfortable. As I write this, she was doing exactly that and my girlfriend just texted me that she literally was so uncomfortable by it that she just left for a friends place. She also just refuses to stay in the same space as me unless my girlfriend is in the room with us. I can't get two seconds alone with my girlfriend because she just follows her around. And if she doesn't go with my girlfriend, she'll immediately just get up and go to her side of the room, kitchen, or bathroom, often times moping around and almost never speaking to me. She activity avoids me at this point.

She's constantly waking me up when I'm sleeping and every single night she's always making some loud sounds like using a hammer, using her blender, or most commonly playing a guitar past 9pm. I'm terrified I'm going to get a noise complaint soon. Ive asked her multiple times to stop by 9pm and she keeps looking at me like im stupid or gives attitude in response. I'm always so exhausted on top of the normal exhaustion I feel because of my narcolepsy, so sleep is so soooo important for me and she just keeps waking me up. Speaking of narcolepsy actually, around the time I met her and she learned I've been diagnosed with it, she told me she thinks she's narcoleptic herself. Now that I've gotten to know her for this long, I don't believe it one bit. She shows no signs or symptoms of anyone who has narcolepsy. So I don't know why she said that and it makes me suspicious.

Mia also just... doesn't know how to be poor. I'm not exactly sure how else to put it, but she's terrible with money. She also has a terrible diet that consists of mostly fast food and sweets. She buys so much random food stuff that she just doesn't use and is ordering Doordash often. She has this weird thing where we are fully stocked on food, but she just *can't* eat anything we have and she is has to buy herself doordash right now and if we suggest her to not waste her money and just eat something here, we'll even make it for her, she'll breakdown crying and ball up in the corner sobbing about it until she get's it. She'll always throw out some medical terminology that we don't understand to find some exact reason on why she needs this specific thing. The last one I remember it was about prep time and she'll like pass out or something, even though it would've been faster to make food at home. But when we pointed that out it was something about electrolytes and carbohydrates or something? It didn't make any sense. I also just want it to be clear, we have ZERO access to her finances. We have no clue what it looks like and we aren't trying to take it or force her to buy anything. All we are saying is just gentle suggestions to save the money because we're all on such a tight budget.

We've previously asked Mia to get a case worker and to go into therapy multiple times now. She keeps saying she will but never takes any action to do so and I'm so tired. As of this past week she's been incredibly short and snappy with us now and we're at a loss on what to do. My home feels like a hoarders house because of all of the crap she brought in and the mess she's caused. I feel like she's manipulative to my girlfriend most of all and I see that it's really breaking her down. I've never seen her cry so often. It's not like we can just kick her out though, she'll die on the streets!

This is driving me towards what feels like insanity at this point. I will admit, me and my girlfriend have gotten into fights where I did yell at her about how much I hate this situation and how tired I am while Mia heard it all. I'm not perfect by any means, but I feel like I'm reacting fairly normal to how anyone would going through the same thing. And I've never seen any proof on her being evicted. She's told us she'd give us medical information so we can give it to the parametrics when they arrive but it hasn't happened and we've been asking for that for almost a year now! She now apparently thinks I believe she's faking her disabilities which isn't entirely true. I think she's definitely using them to her advantage and over playing it sometimes. I also wonder if this is just self inflicted? And how exactly do you know you're going to die soon? She keeps skipping her doctor's appointments so how does she know that this isn't completely preventable? But when I say that, I'm told that I'm being an unempathetic asshole.

Anyway... sorry for the length of this. Am I the asshole here?

TLDR:
My chronically ill friend might be manipulating me and my gf and moved into my studio apartment without asking me by crying to my gf while I was at work saying that she thinks shes going to die soon. I think she's playing up a lot of it and she's self inflicting a lot of it on to herself. I have come to believe shes using us and its ruining our lives, and because of that, I'm being treated like I'm the one in the wrong.",2,1754300482.0,AITAH,5,0.63,False

I've found the hardest part about disappearing is getting a new national insurance number. It used to be easy. Back when there was no national insurance number. You could walk out of town and into a new one, just so long as you didn‚Äôt make too much of a name for yourself. The bigger the name, the further you had to walk. A national insurance number makes it very difficult, and now with social media, I‚Äôll have to be careful. I‚Äôll need to change my face - more than I usually do - and fame is no longer a curse. It‚Äôs a death sentence.

When they introduced the national insurance number in 1948, it wasn‚Äôt too difficult to circumvent. In actuality, I needn‚Äôt until my legal age would bring me under scrutiny. A few off hand comments and a bit of makeup could get me by for a decade, but soon my young complexion caused cognitive dissonance when they discovered my age. It‚Äôs around that time that I realised that I‚Äôd need to change my national insurance number.

1972. I was legally 54, but I looked 30. For a time I applied makeup. A bit of powder and blush to give an aging man's pallor. Sometimes they‚Äôd ask if I was unwell, and I‚Äôd go with it for a few days or a week and then alter my complexion. It was a sudden, all encompassing pain when I realised, from the look in the eyes of my dentist at the time, that I‚Äôd need a new one.



2

The very first step in getting a new identity was to make an inquiry at the relevant government office. My memory fails me as to what this office was in 1972. I made a call on a pay phone - I think I was in London at the time next to a busy coffee shop - and asked a series of questions without giving too much away. If I were to forget my national insurance number, where would I find it? Would it be the same number? Do I need to come into the office or will it be posted to me? Will it cost? If, for any reason, my circumstances change, how would I apply for a new one?

A new one? They asked. Why would you need a new one?

Hypothetically, I said.¬†

It was lucky the person who picked up the phone wasn‚Äôt of a suspicious disposition. They told me I‚Äôd simply need to apply and all I‚Äôd need is my passport. Shit, I thought. I distinctly remember almost saying it into the receiver.¬†

Where was I going to get a new passport? I didn‚Äôt know anyone who worked in the business of forging passports. I largely stayed away from any criminal activity for fear of being incarcerated. Petty crime I could consider in a pinch, but anything that would give me 10 years was out of the question. I decided to go to the darkest, dingiest, deepest pub burrowed in the south of London and look for a geezer.

Harry, he said his name was. I sat in the corner of the pub with a warm pint, away from any smokers, and sipped my drink. He sat next to me. He called me geez, and from his fussing body language I figured he was the type to at least know someone who knows someone. That and the fact that he asked me for a few pence to get himself a pint.

Harry introduced me to John, and John introduced me to Peter. It sounds awfully cliche, but while John wanted a bit of change for his trouble, Peter asked me to do something for him. He simply wanted me to transport a package for him from point A to point B. Point B being a dock in the north of Wales. The less I knew the better. My nerves are not the strongest.

You only can do it when on weekday/weekend, other wise you will be tired on working and it will reduce your performance and etc.

It's not also about hobbies but second or third job, try not to consume coffee and see if you able to do it, i don't think so.

He showed up. Every day.  
In words, yes  
But more in presence.  
In laughter.  
In the way he brought me coffee.  
In the way he looked at me when I didn‚Äôt feel beautiful and said it anyway.

Because he loved me, I felt safe.  
I felt whole.  
I felt seen.

And now that he‚Äôs gone‚Ä¶  
I still feel that.

Not all the time.  
Not in the same way.  
But it‚Äôs there like a thread running through me.

The kind of love we had doesn‚Äôt just disappear.  
It shaped me.

It shaped how I see myself.  
How I talk to myself.  
How I move through this world even when it‚Äôs too quiet and too heavy.

I know not everyone gets a love like ours.  
I know how rare it is.  
How precious.  
How undeserved and deeply, fully mine.

That love gave me strength while he was here.  
And now, it‚Äôs what keeps me going.

When I doubt myself,  
I remember the way he believed in me.

When I feel alone,  
I remember how fully I was loved.

When I wonder who I am now,  
I remember:  
*I‚Äôm the woman Gary loved.*

And because he loved me,  
I love differently now.

I reach for people.  
I pause before rushing.  
I cry when I need to.  
I say the true thing, even when my voice shakes.

Because he loved me, I don‚Äôt want to waste this life.  
Even though it hurts.  
Even though it‚Äôs not the life we planned.

His love gave me a soft place to land.  
And now, I carry that softness into everything I do.

1mh8o6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1mh8o6u/my_time_at_stone_brook_correctional/,My time at Stone Brook correctional,"The courtroom smelled like old paper and cheap cologne. That‚Äôs the first thing I remember. That, and the silence after the judge read my sentence.

Ten years. No parole.

I didn‚Äôt flinch. I just stood there with my hands cuffed in front of me, trying not to look at anyone. Not my sister in the back row. Not the guy I put in the hospital. Not the bailiff waiting to drag me out like a sack of trash.

My lawyer gave me this practiced frown, like he wanted to say ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt quite bring himself to care.

They walked me out the side door, wrists and ankles chained, past rows of dull beige walls and officers who didn‚Äôt bother to glance up from their desks. Outside, the transport van was already waiting, engine running. It looked exactly like I imagined it would.

Two other inmates were in the back when I climbed in. One of them was this wiry white guy with a shaved head and shaky legs, couldn‚Äôt stop muttering under his breath. The other was bigger, heavier, maybe late twenties, face like he‚Äôd already been in a dozen fights he lost. No one talked.

The drive took about two hours. I counted time by the songs I could barely hear through the van‚Äôs rattling frame. Every now and then I‚Äôd catch a glimpse of the road through the slotted windows‚Äîjust pine trees, cracked pavement, a few distant power lines. I figured we were headed to Stonebrook Correctional, same as most of the mid-level sentences in the county.

And I was right. Kind of.

Stonebrook looked like a default prison setting from a TV show‚Äîtall, cold walls of poured concrete, barbed wire, watchtowers. A sun-faded sign over the front gate. Uniformed guards walking the perimeter in pairs, hands on their hips like they had nothing better to do. It looked‚Ä¶ normal.

We were processed through intake. Print scan. Mug shots. Forms I didn‚Äôt read. I got my state-issued orange jumpsuit, a mesh bag with cheap toiletries, and a scratchy blanket that smelled like dust and bleach. A nurse checked my vitals and jabbed a needle in my arm for TB. All of it routine.

When they brought me to C-block, I thought it would feel heavier. But it didn‚Äôt. Just more concrete. More steel. More silence broken up by the occasional shout or echoing clang of a door slamming somewhere down the line.

My cell was on the second tier. Two bunks, a steel sink-toilet combo, a slit window too high up to see anything but sky. My cellmate was already there‚Äîbottom bunk, headphones on, eyes closed. Skinny. Early thirties maybe. Brown skin, shaved head, a faint scar cutting across the bridge of his nose.

I set my bag down and sat on the top bunk.

He didn‚Äôt move for a few minutes. Then he opened one eye, looked up at me, and pulled his headphones down.

‚ÄúYou snore?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think so,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He sat up and offered a hand. ‚ÄúRios.‚Äù

‚ÄúMarcus.‚Äù

We shook. He nodded like that settled something. Then he went back to his music.


---

The first few days passed like they always describe it: painfully slow. Wake up at 5. Count. Breakfast in the chow hall‚Äîcold eggs, white toast, lukewarm coffee if you‚Äôre lucky. Then a few hours of dead time. Yard or rec, depending on the weather. More count. More silence.

No one really talked to me at first. That was fine.

Rios, though, was different. He didn‚Äôt say much, but he didn‚Äôt give off the usual don‚Äôt mess with me energy, either. Just... tired. In a quiet, steady way. On the second night, he asked if I played chess. I said sure, and we started using the board scratched into the floor under the bunk. Rolled-up paper pieces. Kept us distracted.

‚ÄúYou get a plea deal?‚Äù he asked, not looking up from the board.

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúThey got me on a second strike. Armed robbery. Said I ‚Äòfit the description‚Äô.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt talk more than that, but it helped. Having someone to sit in the same silence with without feeling like you were being watched.


---

By the end of the first week, I started noticing things that didn‚Äôt sit right.

It was subtle at first. A guy in the mess line one morning just wasn‚Äôt there the next day. One of the older inmates in laundry‚Äîquiet, slow-moving, always humming‚Äîjust‚Ä¶ gone. His bunk was empty. Sheets folded. Nameplate removed.

‚ÄúTransfer,‚Äù the guard said when someone asked.

But transfers don‚Äôt happen without paperwork. Without buses. Without someone packing up their stuff.

I asked Rios if he noticed.

He hesitated, just for a beat, then said, ‚ÄúPeople come and go. Best not to think too hard about it.‚Äù

The way he said it wasn‚Äôt dismissive. It was cautious. Like he was testing to see if I‚Äôd keep asking.

I didn‚Äôt. Not then.

But I started counting.

Three disappearances in the first two weeks.

And then came the fourth.


Prison has rules. The kind that don‚Äôt get written down.

One of the first things you learn inside is who not to sit near in the chow hall, whose eyes to avoid, and which color shoelaces mean what. Even before you learn your inmate number, you learn the real structure: who owns what, who pays who, and who bleeds for who.

Stonebrook had three main gangs: the Crimson Lords, mostly Black and tightly organized; La Frontera, the dominant Latino group; and The Hessians, white supremacist lifers who ran most of the contraband and extortion.

There were smaller cliques, sure‚Äîsome Asians in the laundry unit, a few scattered Muslims who kept to themselves‚Äîbut those three carved the prison into territories. Showers, rec hours, cell blocks, even the mess line. Everything had a price or a pecking order.

I didn‚Äôt belong to anyone, which made me a target and a curiosity.

Rios, though‚Ä¶ Rios could float between the cracks.

The first time I saw it was in the yard. We were doing slow laps on the gravel, talking about old jobs and bad tattoos, when a guy from La Frontera cut across our path. He bumped Rios just hard enough to say this is my house. He didn‚Äôt say a word.

Rios just turned, gave him a dead-eyed stare, and kept walking.

The guy backed off.

Later, I asked him, ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

Rios shrugged. ‚ÄúI did some things for them. But I don‚Äôt wear colors. I keep my head down and my mouth shut. That's worth more than loyalty in a place like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that why no one messes with you?‚Äù

He smiled without humor. ‚ÄúNo one messes with me because they think I‚Äôm already dead.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt ask what that meant. Not then.


---

We got closer in the following days. Talking during count. Sharing food when the kitchen sent out those dry-as-sawdust peanut butter packets. Playing chess on the scratched-up floorboard. He told me about his sister. I told him about my niece. Neither of us had many people on the outside anymore.

‚ÄúYou ever feel like the world‚Äôs just waiting for you to vanish?‚Äù I asked him once.

Rios looked at me, real slow. ‚ÄúI think maybe it already did.‚Äù


---

One night in the shower block, I made a mistake.

I stepped into the wrong stall‚Äîone unofficially claimed by a Hessian named Dunn. Big guy. Neck like a tree trunk. Tattoo of a swastika half-faded on his left arm. I didn‚Äôt know whose spot it was. I was just trying to get in and get out.

He grabbed my arm mid-rinse and slammed me into the tile. My ears rang.

‚ÄúSay please, fresh meat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOr better yet, beg.‚Äù

I turned to square up, even though I knew it wouldn‚Äôt matter.

That‚Äôs when Rios stepped in.

He didn‚Äôt raise his voice. Didn‚Äôt swing. Just looked Dunn in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou remember D-Block two years ago?‚Äù

Dunn paused. For just a second. Then he let go of me.

‚ÄúJust a joke,‚Äù he muttered, walking away.

I never asked Rios what happened in D-Block. I didn‚Äôt want to know.


---

Things kept shifting. Gangs were getting twitchy. Tensions higher than usual. The Crimson Lords started beefing with La Frontera over something no one would say out loud. The Hessians were pulling back‚Äîless loud, less public. Like they knew something and didn‚Äôt want to get caught in it.

People were vanishing more frequently now.

Not in the middle of riots or fights‚Äîquietly. Like ghosts.

Rios noticed it too. One night, after lights out, he whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going after soldiers. Just floaters. Loners. Guys with no affiliation. No protection.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think they want people no one will miss.‚Äù

He looked me dead in the eyes. ‚ÄúThat means you.‚Äù


---

We didn‚Äôt say anything more that night. Just laid there, each on our bunks, listening to the hum of the fluorescent light and the faint sound of a distant door sliding open in the dark.

Neither of us slept.

Not because we were scared exactly.

But because we finally understood we were on borrowed time.



Most nights in Stonebrook, the silence after lights out was its own kind of noise‚Äîbuzzing fluorescents, the occasional cough, the echo of metal echoing from the tiers below. But every now and then, the silence changed. Got tense. Like something was moving through it.

That‚Äôs how I knew Rios was awake.

He didn‚Äôt toss or snore or talk in his sleep. But sometimes, when the darkness felt too tight around the cell, he‚Äôd just sit there on his bunk, staring at the ceiling like he was counting every crack in it.

Tonight was one of those nights.

‚ÄúYou ever think about getting out?‚Äù I whispered.

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. Then: ‚ÄúOnly when I forget what the world looks like.‚Äù

The words sat between us for a second. Then he said, ‚ÄúYou really want to know how I walk between crews?‚Äù

I sat up. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

He swung his legs off the bunk and leaned forward, elbows on knees, voice just low enough not to carry.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about being tough. Tough gets you stabbed. It‚Äôs not about respect, either‚Äîrespect‚Äôs cheap in here. It‚Äôs about leverage. Secrets. Timing.‚Äù

He looked up at me. His eyes weren‚Äôt angry. Just tired. ‚ÄúI did time at Dunnville before this. Had a cousin in La Frontera. Pulled me in when I was green. First week, they had me hold a shiv for a guy named Salgado‚Äîlifelong member, big deal. Only I didn‚Äôt know he was being watched.‚Äù

Rios paused.

‚ÄúThey caught him the next day. Me? They let me walk. I figured I was lucky.‚Äù

He rubbed the scar on his nose.

‚ÄúA week later, I‚Äôm pulled into the admin wing. Not by guards. By two guys in suits who knew everything. My record. My cousin. Even my grandmother‚Äôs church. They gave me a choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of choice?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúFeed them names. Timings. Movements. In exchange, I‚Äôd get moved to better jobs, better blocks. Protection if I needed it.‚Äù

He leaned back against the wall.

‚ÄúBut snitches don‚Äôt live long. So I didn‚Äôt give them what they wanted. Not really. I gave them just enough to stay useful. Told one side what the other already suspected. Never anything that would get a man killed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlackmail?‚Äù

‚ÄúCall it survival.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything for a while. Just watched the way his eyes kept drifting to the corner of the room, like he could hear something I couldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre an informant?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm just a ghost. No crew trusts me, but they remember what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôve pulled knives out of backs, stopped beatdowns, fixed deals when things went south. I‚Äôm not loyal, but I‚Äôm reliable. And in here, that‚Äôs a kind of currency.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that can‚Äôt last forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

He looked at me then‚Äîreally looked at me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had bones broken. Woke up with blood in my shoes once. Someone pissed in my food for six months straight. You know why I didn‚Äôt retaliate?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúBecause if I swing once, I become a side. And sides burn.‚Äù


---

We sat there in silence. Him on the edge of the bunk, me with my knees pulled up, heart thudding from more than just the story. It wasn‚Äôt just what he said‚Äîit was the way he said it. Flat. Matter-of-fact. Like someone telling you what they had for breakfast.

‚ÄúSo why help me?‚Äù I asked finally. ‚ÄúWhy risk getting involved at all?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer right away.

Then: ‚ÄúBecause I think you‚Äôre not stupid. And because I think something‚Äôs coming. And when it hits, I don‚Äôt want to be the only one who sees it.‚Äù

He leaned back again, closed his eyes.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching us, Marcus. You and me. Closer than most.‚Äù


---

The next morning, Torres‚Äô name was scrubbed from the door across the tier.

No goodbyes. No transfer papers. No mess tray left behind.

Just gone.

And for the first time, I noticed that none of the gangs were asking questions.

Not one.



By the time Torres vanished, things inside Stonebrook were changing in ways no one would say out loud.

The rules started warping. The rhythms of the block‚Äîthe only thing that gave life in here a shape‚Äîwere breaking down.

It started with the counts.

They came later than usual. Sometimes twice in the same hour. And the guards doing them weren‚Äôt the usual slack-jawed COs with bad jokes and coffee breath. They were tight-lipped, hard-eyed, and new. Too clean. Like they‚Äôd just stepped off a private security contract and weren‚Äôt used to fluorescent lights.

They didn‚Äôt say names. Just numbers. They looked past us, not at us.

‚ÄúSee that?‚Äù Rios whispered during one count. ‚ÄúThat one with the clipboard?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt flinch when Razorhead sneezed behind him. That man‚Äôs seen combat.‚Äù


---

The gangs were shifting, too.

The Crimson Lords were suddenly quieter. Sharper. I stopped seeing their crew posted up in the common room, laughing over spades games and trading noodle packs. Instead, they huddled in corners, whispering with their backs to the walls.

La Frontera got louder. Paranoid. They started shaking down random floaters for ‚Äútaxes‚Äù and pulling more bodies into their orbit. Some of their guys‚Äîones that used to keep to food trades and weed runs‚Äîwere now running laps in the yard with socks full of batteries.

The Hessians went the opposite direction. Their enforcer types weren‚Äôt prowling like usual. They were keeping to their cells. Quiet. Watchful.

And all through it, more people vanished.

Not the loud ones. Not the lieutenants or soldiers.

Just floaters. Kitchen workers. The guy who did mail sorting. A kid from the library cart who used to hum old soul songs under his breath.

Gone. No announcements. No bunks reassigned.

And the scariest part?

No one asked where they went.


---

Two weeks after Torres disappeared, they locked the block down for thirty-six hours. No yard. No rec. No showers. Just cold trays slid under the door and a guard rotation that changed every four hours like clockwork.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre testing something,‚Äù Rios said as we sat on our bunks, staring at nothing.

‚ÄúTesting what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But this isn‚Äôt discipline. No fights broke out. No riots. This is controlled.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of prison tests things on its own inmates?‚Äù

Rios looked at me. ‚ÄúThe kind that doesn‚Äôt expect anyone to make it to parole.‚Äù


---

When the lockdown lifted, things got worse.

The Crimson Lords‚Äô second-in-command‚ÄîCutter‚Äîwas found in the infirmary with burn marks on his arms and neck. Everyone said he‚Äôd tried to kill himself. That he‚Äôd poured hot coffee on himself and bashed his head against the wall.

But Rios saw him being led down the hall the night before. Calm. Silent. With two of those black-uniformed guards on either side of him.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt do that to himself,‚Äù Rios muttered. ‚ÄúThat was done to him.‚Äù

I believed him.


---

The final straw for me came three nights later.

Lights out. Quiet tier. I was half asleep, drifting in that haze between dreams and paranoia, when I heard the door at the end of the hallway click open.

Soft footsteps. Not boots. Not the normal guard cadence.

Something else.

I slid down from my bunk and looked through the cell slit.

A man was walking the hallway. Alone.

Not a CO. Not an inmate I recognized.

He was barefoot. Head shaved. Eyes wide open like he hadn‚Äôt blinked in hours. His jumpsuit was inside out. And his arms‚Äîhis arms‚Äîwere twitching like he couldn‚Äôt control them.

I pressed my face to the slit.

He stopped. Right across from our cell. Not looking at us. Just‚Ä¶ standing there.

Rios was already off his bunk, still as stone, not breathing loud enough to make a sound.

Then the man tilted his head sharply, like a puppet with a broken neck, and walked back the way he came.

No alarm. No announcement. No response.

Just silence.


---

That night, Rios said something I‚Äôll never forget.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not just taking people anymore.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bringing some of them back.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a kind of tired that seeps into your bones after a while in prison. It isn‚Äôt about sleep ‚Äî I sleep in five-minute jolts now, anyway ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing that even blinking wrong could get you noticed.

And right now, being noticed might be the most dangerous thing in the world.

Rios didn‚Äôt speak much the day after the hallway incident. Neither did I. But that silence between us‚Ä¶ it was louder than most conversations in here. Something changed that night. Not just with the man ‚Äî thing ‚Äî that wandered past our cell, but with us.

We couldn‚Äôt ignore it anymore.

We had to start looking.


---

It wasn‚Äôt easy. You can‚Äôt just start poking around in a place like Stonebrook. Eyes are everywhere. And not just guard eyes.

Inmates see everything. They notice when you linger by the wrong corridor. When you ask one too many questions. When you act like you‚Äôre thinking about anything except surviving the day.

So Rios and I moved careful.

We started in the library.

There‚Äôs a broken vent tucked behind the nonfiction shelves ‚Äî most people don‚Äôt even notice it. But Rios said sometimes you can hear things through it. Movement. Humming. Once, he heard a scream. Not loud. Like someone trying not to be heard.

We took turns sitting near it for the next week. I pretended to be reading an outdated repair manual while I kept my ear tilted just so.

One day, I heard something.

A low voice. Garbled by static or‚Ä¶ maybe distance. It was talking fast. Panicked.

Then a snap. Not loud. Wet.

Then silence.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.


---

Rios had better luck.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a door past laundry,‚Äù he told me one evening. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never opened. Not even for supply drops. But I saw two guards lead a guy through it two nights ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúFloater. No crew. Skinny kid. Kept to himself. He ain‚Äôt back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd the guards look like?‚Äù

Rios just gave me a look. I already knew.

Black boots. No names on their badges.

Same ones I‚Äôd seen with the twitching man.


---

We kept mapping what we could. Quietly.

Rios made a crude layout using sugar packets and string on our bunk during lockup. Showed me where the door was. The hallway I‚Äôd seen the thing in. The rooms that had gone dark after the last two disappearances. Even some of the old tunnels ‚Äî ones blocked off after a fire years ago ‚Äî that might still connect under the medical wing.

‚ÄúWhy you know all this?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just looked at me like he was doing the math.

‚ÄúBecause this place took something from me,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúA long time ago.‚Äù


---

The gangs were growing tense again. Like they could smell something moving through the walls. People were twitchier. Jumpier. Fights broke out over dumb things ‚Äî a stolen roll of toilet paper, a card game gone sideways ‚Äî but nobody ever finished the fights.

It was like everyone was saving energy for something worse.

And through it all, inmates kept vanishing.

Only floaters. No shot callers. No gang enforcers. Just the ones nobody would miss.

Which meant Rios and I were walking a knife‚Äôs edge.

We needed to know more, but we couldn‚Äôt push too hard. Couldn‚Äôt look curious. Couldn‚Äôt get close to that door without someone asking why.

So we made a new plan.

Not a big one. Just a thread.

One of the janitors ‚Äî Jenkins ‚Äî worked that back hallway during night detail. Old head, didn‚Äôt talk much, shuffled around with a mop and radio static playing in his back pocket. But he saw things. And unlike most of the COs, he actually paid attention.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to him,‚Äù Rios said. ‚ÄúSee what he knows.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure he won‚Äôt rat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he wanted to, he would‚Äôve already.‚Äù


---

Rios came back from laundry detail three days later with a busted lip and a bruise blooming under one eye.

I froze when I saw him. ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúJenkins talked,‚Äù he muttered, wiping blood from his nose. ‚ÄúAnd someone didn‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But it wasn‚Äôt an inmate.‚Äù


---

That night, we sat on the floor of the cell, backs against cold cement, whispering under our breath.

‚ÄúJenkins said they take them down below,‚Äù Rios told me. ‚ÄúPast the lower level boiler rooms. There‚Äôs a freight elevator. One they don‚Äôt log.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù

Rios just shook his head.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt get that far. Said the only person he knew who did‚Ä¶ came back stuttering nonsense. Then hung himself with a phone cord.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think God comes down this deep.‚Äù


---

We made one promise to each other that night.

If one of us vanished ‚Äî if we got taken ‚Äî the other keeps looking.

Even if it means never leaving this place alive.


Most people don‚Äôt come back.

That‚Äôs what made it easier, I think ‚Äî to pretend they were just transferred or paroled or maybe dead. In a place like Stonebrook, people vanish all the time. Floaters don‚Äôt have anyone on the outside raising hell. They just disappear.

But now‚Ä¶ a few are coming back.

And whatever they‚Äôve seen ‚Äî or become ‚Äî it‚Äôs too late to pretend it‚Äôs still just prison anymore.


---

The first one we noticed was Darnell.

Quiet dude. Used to be a preacher or something. He went to seg for medical after a seizure, and three weeks later he came back walking like his bones didn‚Äôt fit right.

His cellmate wouldn‚Äôt go near him.

Said he talked in his sleep. Not words ‚Äî sounds. Clicking, like his tongue was broken. And he had a new habit of just‚Ä¶ standing at the sink for hours, tapping it with the edge of his fingernail. Tap, tap, tap. Same rhythm. Every night. Like a code.

One day during count, he just pissed himself and started laughing. The guards dragged him out screaming. I haven‚Äôt seen him since.


---

Then there was Whitaker.

A white boy from D-block who used to draw comics in the dayroom. Real talent. Funny dude. He disappeared during a fire drill, came back six days later with fresh bandages around both arms.

When the guards unshackled him, he didn‚Äôt say a word.

He just sat in the corner of the yard, drawing circles in the dirt. Not with a stick ‚Äî with his fingernail. Deep enough to bleed.

Rios and I watched from across the yard.

""You notice his pupils?"" Rios muttered.

I nodded. ‚ÄúToo big.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt see the whites anymore. Like he‚Äôs already underground.‚Äù

Later, Whitaker bit off a piece of his own tongue. Didn‚Äôt scream. Just chewed. Then smiled.

They sedated him in front of everyone.

No one laughed. No one even flinched.


---

I started keeping track.

Names. Behaviors. Notes scratched into the inside cover of a tattered Bible. Rios called it our ‚Äúlittle book of the damned.‚Äù

They were all floaters.

They were all gone between four and twelve days.

And they all came back with something missing. Or added.

Some talked to walls. One guy stopped sleeping entirely. Another started folding everything he touched ‚Äî toilet paper, clothes, food ‚Äî into precise, perfect squares. Then he shoved them in his mouth until his cheeks puffed out like a dead squirrel.

But none of them said anything about where they‚Äôd been.

Not until Delaney.


---

Delaney was a burner ‚Äî arson, second strike, no gang ties. Smart, quiet, kept to himself. One night, I saw him watching me through the rec cage wire.

Not looking.

Watching.

Eyes sharp, steady, alert. Not broken like the others.

The next morning, he was in the med line. I pulled Rios with me to get close.

He was muttering to himself ‚Äî not loud ‚Äî just under his breath.

But it wasn‚Äôt gibberish.

It was numbers.

‚ÄúThree floors down. Thirteen doors. Eight minutes between injections. Pain starts at minute five.‚Äù

Then he blinked like he just realized we were listening.

‚ÄúThey put something in me,‚Äù he whispered, staring straight at Rios. ‚ÄúI can feel it chewing when I sleep.‚Äù

Before we could ask more, the nurse called him forward. We never saw him again.


---

After that, Rios started sleeping less. He stopped joking. Stopped playing chess. He watched people like they were ticking.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not gonna find answers,‚Äù he said one night, ‚Äúuntil someone survives long enough to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs not gonna happen,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey make sure of it.‚Äù

He paused, then looked at me, voice low and cold.

‚ÄúUnless we find a way to make one talk.‚Äù


---

We didn‚Äôt have to wait long.

Two days later, we got a new cellmate.

He didn‚Äôt say a word when the guard dropped him off.

Just sat on the bottom bunk, breathing through his mouth, eyes flicking toward the corner of the room like something was waiting there.

His arms were covered in scar tissue. Fresh, angry, surgical-looking. His fingernails were cracked. His left pupil didn‚Äôt dilate right.

And his wrists‚Ä¶ they had the faint outlines of shackles. Inside the skin.

Rios gave me a look. I nodded back.

This one had come back.

And maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî he hadn‚Äôt finished breaking yet.


metallic scrape of our cell door sliding open and two guards in silence, hauling him in like dead weight.

No cuffs. No words.

They dumped him onto the bottom bunk ‚Äî my bunk ‚Äî and walked off without even looking at us.

He hit the mattress like a ragdoll. Didn‚Äôt even flinch. Just lay there with one arm twisted beneath him, eyes half-lidded, staring at the underside of Rios‚Äôs bunk above.

The door slammed shut.

We had a new roommate.


---

His name ‚Äî according to the ID tag zip-tied to his ankle ‚Äî was Jerome Ellis.

Float time: 11 days.

I recognized him. Sort of. We‚Äôd crossed paths during orientation. He‚Äôd had a stutter then, talked nervously, scratched his arms a lot.

Now‚Ä¶ now his hands stayed curled up tight, like he was holding onto something that wasn‚Äôt there.

That first night, he didn‚Äôt sleep. Not really. He just lay there, motionless, except for the occasional twitch in his cheek. Every now and then I‚Äôd catch a whisper slip from his mouth.

Not words.

Just a dry, rhythmic ""click-click-click.""

The same sound Darnell used to make.


---

By day three, the smell started.

It wasn‚Äôt strong ‚Äî not at first ‚Äî just‚Ä¶ wrong. Like antiseptic mixed with mold, with something sweeter underneath. Like meat left too long in a sealed fridge.

Rios noticed it too. He waited until lights out, then leaned close to me on the top bunk.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not right, hermano. Something‚Äôs eating at him. Inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúFiguratively?‚Äù

He just shook his head.

‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt think it is.‚Äù


---

On the fourth night, I woke to the sound of fabric tearing.

Jerome was hunched on the floor, his back to me, hands working furiously. I blinked the sleep out of my eyes and leaned over the edge of the bunk.

He‚Äôd ripped open the mattress.

Not like he was hiding something ‚Äî not like he was searching ‚Äî more like he was dissecting it.

And he was talking.

Low. Hypnotic.

‚Äú‚Ä¶can‚Äôt sleep or it wakes up, can‚Äôt sleep or it wakes up, can‚Äôt sleep‚Äî‚Äù

Rios dropped down from the top bunk and stood behind him.

‚ÄúJerome,‚Äù he said quietly, ‚Äúwhat did they do to you?‚Äù

Jerome didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúThey made a door. Said it was for healing. Said the body could hold more than pain if we just let go of the limits.‚Äù

His voice had this eerie calm to it. Like he was reciting a bedtime story.

‚ÄúBut the body isn‚Äôt empty. It never was.‚Äù


---

I crouched beside him.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the door, Jerome?‚Äù

His hands stopped moving.

He turned to me slowly ‚Äî eyes glassy, wet ‚Äî and smiled like a child caught doing something bad.

‚ÄúThey put it behind my ribs,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always open now.‚Äù

Then he grabbed my hand and shoved it under his shirt.

Not in a weird way ‚Äî not aggressive ‚Äî but like he needed me to feel it.

His chest was warm. Too warm. The skin pulsed unnaturally, like a second heartbeat had grown beside the first.

I jerked my hand away.

Rios stared down at him like he was trying to make a choice.

‚ÄúCan he tell us more?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs not done changing,‚Äù Rios muttered.

That‚Äôs when we heard it.

The scraping.


---

It came from inside the wall behind our bunk.

Slow at first. Deliberate.

Then faster. Clawing.

Jerome started whispering again.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open it, don‚Äôt open it, don‚Äôt open it‚Äî‚Äù

The cell light buzzed and popped. Out.

Dark.

Rios reached for the emergency buzzer.

It didn‚Äôt work.

We both backed into the corner as Jerome laughed ‚Äî not cruelly, but like someone remembering a joke from a dream.

The scraping stopped.

The wall went silent.

And then‚Ä¶ nothing.

Just darkness and breath.


---

The next morning, Jerome was gone.

No guards came. No keys. No doors opened.

He was just gone.

And the only proof he‚Äôd ever been there was the gutted mattress, the stink still clinging to the floor, and a single phrase carved into the concrete beneath the bunk.

‚ÄúTHE DOOR IS OPEN.‚Äù

1mh8h1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mh8h1y/my_time_at_stone_brook_correctional_facility/,My time at Stone Brook correctional facility (Series),"The courtroom smelled like old paper and cheap cologne. That‚Äôs the first thing I remember. That, and the silence after the judge read my sentence.

Ten years. No parole.

I didn‚Äôt flinch. I just stood there with my hands cuffed in front of me, trying not to look at anyone. Not my sister in the back row. Not the guy I put in the hospital. Not the bailiff waiting to drag me out like a sack of trash.

My lawyer gave me this practiced frown, like he wanted to say ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt quite bring himself to care.

They walked me out the side door, wrists and ankles chained, past rows of dull beige walls and officers who didn‚Äôt bother to glance up from their desks. Outside, the transport van was already waiting, engine running. It looked exactly like I imagined it would.

Two other inmates were in the back when I climbed in. One of them was this wiry white guy with a shaved head and shaky legs, couldn‚Äôt stop muttering under his breath. The other was bigger, heavier, maybe late twenties, face like he‚Äôd already been in a dozen fights he lost. No one talked.

The drive took about two hours. I counted time by the songs I could barely hear through the van‚Äôs rattling frame. Every now and then I‚Äôd catch a glimpse of the road through the slotted windows‚Äîjust pine trees, cracked pavement, a few distant power lines. I figured we were headed to Stonebrook Correctional, same as most of the mid-level sentences in the county.

And I was right. Kind of.

Stonebrook looked like a default prison setting from a TV show‚Äîtall, cold walls of poured concrete, barbed wire, watchtowers. A sun-faded sign over the front gate. Uniformed guards walking the perimeter in pairs, hands on their hips like they had nothing better to do. It looked‚Ä¶ normal.

We were processed through intake. Print scan. Mug shots. Forms I didn‚Äôt read. I got my state-issued orange jumpsuit, a mesh bag with cheap toiletries, and a scratchy blanket that smelled like dust and bleach. A nurse checked my vitals and jabbed a needle in my arm for TB. All of it routine.

When they brought me to C-block, I thought it would feel heavier. But it didn‚Äôt. Just more concrete. More steel. More silence broken up by the occasional shout or echoing clang of a door slamming somewhere down the line.

My cell was on the second tier. Two bunks, a steel sink-toilet combo, a slit window too high up to see anything but sky. My cellmate was already there‚Äîbottom bunk, headphones on, eyes closed. Skinny. Early thirties maybe. Brown skin, shaved head, a faint scar cutting across the bridge of his nose.

I set my bag down and sat on the top bunk.

He didn‚Äôt move for a few minutes. Then he opened one eye, looked up at me, and pulled his headphones down.

‚ÄúYou snore?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think so,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He sat up and offered a hand. ‚ÄúRios.‚Äù

‚ÄúMarcus.‚Äù

We shook. He nodded like that settled something. Then he went back to his music.


---

The first few days passed like they always describe it: painfully slow. Wake up at 5. Count. Breakfast in the chow hall‚Äîcold eggs, white toast, lukewarm coffee if you‚Äôre lucky. Then a few hours of dead time. Yard or rec, depending on the weather. More count. More silence.

No one really talked to me at first. That was fine.

Rios, though, was different. He didn‚Äôt say much, but he didn‚Äôt give off the usual don‚Äôt mess with me energy, either. Just... tired. In a quiet, steady way. On the second night, he asked if I played chess. I said sure, and we started using the board scratched into the floor under the bunk. Rolled-up paper pieces. Kept us distracted.

‚ÄúYou get a plea deal?‚Äù he asked, not looking up from the board.

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúThey got me on a second strike. Armed robbery. Said I ‚Äòfit the description‚Äô.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt talk more than that, but it helped. Having someone to sit in the same silence with without feeling like you were being watched.


---

By the end of the first week, I started noticing things that didn‚Äôt sit right.

It was subtle at first. A guy in the mess line one morning just wasn‚Äôt there the next day. One of the older inmates in laundry‚Äîquiet, slow-moving, always humming‚Äîjust‚Ä¶ gone. His bunk was empty. Sheets folded. Nameplate removed.

‚ÄúTransfer,‚Äù the guard said when someone asked.

But transfers don‚Äôt happen without paperwork. Without buses. Without someone packing up their stuff.

I asked Rios if he noticed.

He hesitated, just for a beat, then said, ‚ÄúPeople come and go. Best not to think too hard about it.‚Äù

The way he said it wasn‚Äôt dismissive. It was cautious. Like he was testing to see if I‚Äôd keep asking.

I didn‚Äôt. Not then.

But I started counting.

Three disappearances in the first two weeks.

And then came the fourth.


Prison has rules. The kind that don‚Äôt get written down.

One of the first things you learn inside is who not to sit near in the chow hall, whose eyes to avoid, and which color shoelaces mean what. Even before you learn your inmate number, you learn the real structure: who owns what, who pays who, and who bleeds for who.

Stonebrook had three main gangs: the Crimson Lords, mostly Black and tightly organized; La Frontera, the dominant Latino group; and The Hessians, white supremacist lifers who ran most of the contraband and extortion.

There were smaller cliques, sure‚Äîsome Asians in the laundry unit, a few scattered Muslims who kept to themselves‚Äîbut those three carved the prison into territories. Showers, rec hours, cell blocks, even the mess line. Everything had a price or a pecking order.

I didn‚Äôt belong to anyone, which made me a target and a curiosity.

Rios, though‚Ä¶ Rios could float between the cracks.

The first time I saw it was in the yard. We were doing slow laps on the gravel, talking about old jobs and bad tattoos, when a guy from La Frontera cut across our path. He bumped Rios just hard enough to say this is my house. He didn‚Äôt say a word.

Rios just turned, gave him a dead-eyed stare, and kept walking.

The guy backed off.

Later, I asked him, ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

Rios shrugged. ‚ÄúI did some things for them. But I don‚Äôt wear colors. I keep my head down and my mouth shut. That's worth more than loyalty in a place like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that why no one messes with you?‚Äù

He smiled without humor. ‚ÄúNo one messes with me because they think I‚Äôm already dead.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt ask what that meant. Not then.


---

We got closer in the following days. Talking during count. Sharing food when the kitchen sent out those dry-as-sawdust peanut butter packets. Playing chess on the scratched-up floorboard. He told me about his sister. I told him about my niece. Neither of us had many people on the outside anymore.

‚ÄúYou ever feel like the world‚Äôs just waiting for you to vanish?‚Äù I asked him once.

Rios looked at me, real slow. ‚ÄúI think maybe it already did.‚Äù


---

One night in the shower block, I made a mistake.

I stepped into the wrong stall‚Äîone unofficially claimed by a Hessian named Dunn. Big guy. Neck like a tree trunk. Tattoo of a swastika half-faded on his left arm. I didn‚Äôt know whose spot it was. I was just trying to get in and get out.

He grabbed my arm mid-rinse and slammed me into the tile. My ears rang.

‚ÄúSay please, fresh meat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOr better yet, beg.‚Äù

I turned to square up, even though I knew it wouldn‚Äôt matter.

That‚Äôs when Rios stepped in.

He didn‚Äôt raise his voice. Didn‚Äôt swing. Just looked Dunn in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou remember D-Block two years ago?‚Äù

Dunn paused. For just a second. Then he let go of me.

‚ÄúJust a joke,‚Äù he muttered, walking away.

I never asked Rios what happened in D-Block. I didn‚Äôt want to know.


---

Things kept shifting. Gangs were getting twitchy. Tensions higher than usual. The Crimson Lords started beefing with La Frontera over something no one would say out loud. The Hessians were pulling back‚Äîless loud, less public. Like they knew something and didn‚Äôt want to get caught in it.

People were vanishing more frequently now.

Not in the middle of riots or fights‚Äîquietly. Like ghosts.

Rios noticed it too. One night, after lights out, he whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going after soldiers. Just floaters. Loners. Guys with no affiliation. No protection.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think they want people no one will miss.‚Äù

He looked me dead in the eyes. ‚ÄúThat means you.‚Äù


---

We didn‚Äôt say anything more that night. Just laid there, each on our bunks, listening to the hum of the fluorescent light and the faint sound of a distant door sliding open in the dark.

Neither of us slept.

Not because we were scared exactly.

But because we finally understood we were on borrowed time.



Most nights in Stonebrook, the silence after lights out was its own kind of noise‚Äîbuzzing fluorescents, the occasional cough, the echo of metal echoing from the tiers below. But every now and then, the silence changed. Got tense. Like something was moving through it.

That‚Äôs how I knew Rios was awake.

He didn‚Äôt toss or snore or talk in his sleep. But sometimes, when the darkness felt too tight around the cell, he‚Äôd just sit there on his bunk, staring at the ceiling like he was counting every crack in it.

Tonight was one of those nights.

‚ÄúYou ever think about getting out?‚Äù I whispered.

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. Then: ‚ÄúOnly when I forget what the world looks like.‚Äù

The words sat between us for a second. Then he said, ‚ÄúYou really want to know how I walk between crews?‚Äù

I sat up. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

He swung his legs off the bunk and leaned forward, elbows on knees, voice just low enough not to carry.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about being tough. Tough gets you stabbed. It‚Äôs not about respect, either‚Äîrespect‚Äôs cheap in here. It‚Äôs about leverage. Secrets. Timing.‚Äù

He looked up at me. His eyes weren‚Äôt angry. Just tired. ‚ÄúI did time at Dunnville before this. Had a cousin in La Frontera. Pulled me in when I was green. First week, they had me hold a shiv for a guy named Salgado‚Äîlifelong member, big deal. Only I didn‚Äôt know he was being watched.‚Äù

Rios paused.

‚ÄúThey caught him the next day. Me? They let me walk. I figured I was lucky.‚Äù

He rubbed the scar on his nose.

‚ÄúA week later, I‚Äôm pulled into the admin wing. Not by guards. By two guys in suits who knew everything. My record. My cousin. Even my grandmother‚Äôs church. They gave me a choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of choice?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúFeed them names. Timings. Movements. In exchange, I‚Äôd get moved to better jobs, better blocks. Protection if I needed it.‚Äù

He leaned back against the wall.

‚ÄúBut snitches don‚Äôt live long. So I didn‚Äôt give them what they wanted. Not really. I gave them just enough to stay useful. Told one side what the other already suspected. Never anything that would get a man killed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlackmail?‚Äù

‚ÄúCall it survival.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything for a while. Just watched the way his eyes kept drifting to the corner of the room, like he could hear something I couldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre an informant?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm just a ghost. No crew trusts me, but they remember what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôve pulled knives out of backs, stopped beatdowns, fixed deals when things went south. I‚Äôm not loyal, but I‚Äôm reliable. And in here, that‚Äôs a kind of currency.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that can‚Äôt last forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

He looked at me then‚Äîreally looked at me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had bones broken. Woke up with blood in my shoes once. Someone pissed in my food for six months straight. You know why I didn‚Äôt retaliate?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúBecause if I swing once, I become a side. And sides burn.‚Äù


---

We sat there in silence. Him on the edge of the bunk, me with my knees pulled up, heart thudding from more than just the story. It wasn‚Äôt just what he said‚Äîit was the way he said it. Flat. Matter-of-fact. Like someone telling you what they had for breakfast.

‚ÄúSo why help me?‚Äù I asked finally. ‚ÄúWhy risk getting involved at all?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer right away.

Then: ‚ÄúBecause I think you‚Äôre not stupid. And because I think something‚Äôs coming. And when it hits, I don‚Äôt want to be the only one who sees it.‚Äù

He leaned back again, closed his eyes.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching us, Marcus. You and me. Closer than most.‚Äù


---

The next morning, Torres‚Äô name was scrubbed from the door across the tier.

No goodbyes. No transfer papers. No mess tray left behind.

Just gone.

And for the first time, I noticed that none of the gangs were asking questions.

Not one.



By the time Torres vanished, things inside Stonebrook were changing in ways no one would say out loud.

The rules started warping. The rhythms of the block‚Äîthe only thing that gave life in here a shape‚Äîwere breaking down.

It started with the counts.

They came later than usual. Sometimes twice in the same hour. And the guards doing them weren‚Äôt the usual slack-jawed COs with bad jokes and coffee breath. They were tight-lipped, hard-eyed, and new. Too clean. Like they‚Äôd just stepped off a private security contract and weren‚Äôt used to fluorescent lights.

They didn‚Äôt say names. Just numbers. They looked past us, not at us.

‚ÄúSee that?‚Äù Rios whispered during one count. ‚ÄúThat one with the clipboard?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt flinch when Razorhead sneezed behind him. That man‚Äôs seen combat.‚Äù


---

The gangs were shifting, too.

The Crimson Lords were suddenly quieter. Sharper. I stopped seeing their crew posted up in the common room, laughing over spades games and trading noodle packs. Instead, they huddled in corners, whispering with their backs to the walls.

La Frontera got louder. Paranoid. They started shaking down random floaters for ‚Äútaxes‚Äù and pulling more bodies into their orbit. Some of their guys‚Äîones that used to keep to food trades and weed runs‚Äîwere now running laps in the yard with socks full of batteries.

The Hessians went the opposite direction. Their enforcer types weren‚Äôt prowling like usual. They were keeping to their cells. Quiet. Watchful.

And all through it, more people vanished.

Not the loud ones. Not the lieutenants or soldiers.

Just floaters. Kitchen workers. The guy who did mail sorting. A kid from the library cart who used to hum old soul songs under his breath.

Gone. No announcements. No bunks reassigned.

And the scariest part?

No one asked where they went.


---

Two weeks after Torres disappeared, they locked the block down for thirty-six hours. No yard. No rec. No showers. Just cold trays slid under the door and a guard rotation that changed every four hours like clockwork.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre testing something,‚Äù Rios said as we sat on our bunks, staring at nothing.

‚ÄúTesting what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But this isn‚Äôt discipline. No fights broke out. No riots. This is controlled.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of prison tests things on its own inmates?‚Äù

Rios looked at me. ‚ÄúThe kind that doesn‚Äôt expect anyone to make it to parole.‚Äù


---

When the lockdown lifted, things got worse.

The Crimson Lords‚Äô second-in-command‚ÄîCutter‚Äîwas found in the infirmary with burn marks on his arms and neck. Everyone said he‚Äôd tried to kill himself. That he‚Äôd poured hot coffee on himself and bashed his head against the wall.

But Rios saw him being led down the hall the night before. Calm. Silent. With two of those black-uniformed guards on either side of him.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt do that to himself,‚Äù Rios muttered. ‚ÄúThat was done to him.‚Äù

I believed him.


---

The final straw for me came three nights later.

Lights out. Quiet tier. I was half asleep, drifting in that haze between dreams and paranoia, when I heard the door at the end of the hallway click open.

Soft footsteps. Not boots. Not the normal guard cadence.

Something else.

I slid down from my bunk and looked through the cell slit.

A man was walking the hallway. Alone.

Not a CO. Not an inmate I recognized.

He was barefoot. Head shaved. Eyes wide open like he hadn‚Äôt blinked in hours. His jumpsuit was inside out. And his arms‚Äîhis arms‚Äîwere twitching like he couldn‚Äôt control them.

I pressed my face to the slit.

He stopped. Right across from our cell. Not looking at us. Just‚Ä¶ standing there.

Rios was already off his bunk, still as stone, not breathing loud enough to make a sound.

Then the man tilted his head sharply, like a puppet with a broken neck, and walked back the way he came.

No alarm. No announcement. No response.

Just silence.


---

That night, Rios said something I‚Äôll never forget.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not just taking people anymore.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bringing some of them back.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a kind of tired that seeps into your bones after a while in prison. It isn‚Äôt about sleep ‚Äî I sleep in five-minute jolts now, anyway ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing that even blinking wrong could get you noticed.

And right now, being noticed might be the most dangerous thing in the world.

Rios didn‚Äôt speak much the day after the hallway incident. Neither did I. But that silence between us‚Ä¶ it was louder than most conversations in here. Something changed that night. Not just with the man ‚Äî thing ‚Äî that wandered past our cell, but with us.

We couldn‚Äôt ignore it anymore.

We had to start looking.


---

It wasn‚Äôt easy. You can‚Äôt just start poking around in a place like Stonebrook. Eyes are everywhere. And not just guard eyes.

Inmates see everything. They notice when you linger by the wrong corridor. When you ask one too many questions. When you act like you‚Äôre thinking about anything except surviving the day.

So Rios and I moved careful.

We started in the library.

There‚Äôs a broken vent tucked behind the nonfiction shelves ‚Äî most people don‚Äôt even notice it. But Rios said sometimes you can hear things through it. Movement. Humming. Once, he heard a scream. Not loud. Like someone trying not to be heard.

We took turns sitting near it for the next week. I pretended to be reading an outdated repair manual while I kept my ear tilted just so.

One day, I heard something.

A low voice. Garbled by static or‚Ä¶ maybe distance. It was talking fast. Panicked.

Then a snap. Not loud. Wet.

Then silence.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.


---

Rios had better luck.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a door past laundry,‚Äù he told me one evening. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never opened. Not even for supply drops. But I saw two guards lead a guy through it two nights ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúFloater. No crew. Skinny kid. Kept to himself. He ain‚Äôt back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd the guards look like?‚Äù

Rios just gave me a look. I already knew.

Black boots. No names on their badges.

Same ones I‚Äôd seen with the twitching man.


---

We kept mapping what we could. Quietly.

Rios made a crude layout using sugar packets and string on our bunk during lockup. Showed me where the door was. The hallway I‚Äôd seen the thing in. The rooms that had gone dark after the last two disappearances. Even some of the old tunnels ‚Äî ones blocked off after a fire years ago ‚Äî that might still connect under the medical wing.

‚ÄúWhy you know all this?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just looked at me like he was doing the math.

‚ÄúBecause this place took something from me,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúA long time ago.‚Äù


---

The gangs were growing tense again. Like they could smell something moving through the walls. People were twitchier. Jumpier. Fights broke out over dumb things ‚Äî a stolen roll of toilet paper, a card game gone sideways ‚Äî but nobody ever finished the fights.

It was like everyone was saving energy for something worse.

And through it all, inmates kept vanishing.

Only floaters. No shot callers. No gang enforcers. Just the ones nobody would miss.

Which meant Rios and I were walking a knife‚Äôs edge.

We needed to know more, but we couldn‚Äôt push too hard. Couldn‚Äôt look curious. Couldn‚Äôt get close to that door without someone asking why.

So we made a new plan.

Not a big one. Just a thread.

One of the janitors ‚Äî Jenkins ‚Äî worked that back hallway during night detail. Old head, didn‚Äôt talk much, shuffled around with a mop and radio static playing in his back pocket. But he saw things. And unlike most of the COs, he actually paid attention.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to him,‚Äù Rios said. ‚ÄúSee what he knows.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure he won‚Äôt rat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he wanted to, he would‚Äôve already.‚Äù


---

Rios came back from laundry detail three days later with a busted lip and a bruise blooming under one eye.

I froze when I saw him. ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúJenkins talked,‚Äù he muttered, wiping blood from his nose. ‚ÄúAnd someone didn‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But it wasn‚Äôt an inmate.‚Äù


---

That night, we sat on the floor of the cell, backs against cold cement, whispering under our breath.

‚ÄúJenkins said they take them down below,‚Äù Rios told me. ‚ÄúPast the lower level boiler rooms. There‚Äôs a freight elevator. One they don‚Äôt log.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù

Rios just shook his head.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt get that far. Said the only person he knew who did‚Ä¶ came back stuttering nonsense. Then hung himself with a phone cord.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think God comes down this deep.‚Äù


---

We made one promise to each other that night.

If one of us vanished ‚Äî if we got taken ‚Äî the other keeps looking.

Even if it means never leaving this place alive.


Most people don‚Äôt come back.

That‚Äôs what made it easier, I think ‚Äî to pretend they were just transferred or paroled or maybe dead. In a place like Stonebrook, people vanish all the time. Floaters don‚Äôt have anyone on the outside raising hell. They just disappear.

But now‚Ä¶ a few are coming back.

And whatever they‚Äôve seen ‚Äî or become ‚Äî it‚Äôs too late to pretend it‚Äôs still just prison anymore.


---

The first one we noticed was Darnell.

Quiet dude. Used to be a preacher or something. He went to seg for medical after a seizure, and three weeks later he came back walking like his bones didn‚Äôt fit right.

His cellmate wouldn‚Äôt go near him.

Said he talked in his sleep. Not words ‚Äî sounds. Clicking, like his tongue was broken. And he had a new habit of just‚Ä¶ standing at the sink for hours, tapping it with the edge of his fingernail. Tap, tap, tap. Same rhythm. Every night. Like a code.

One day during count, he just pissed himself and started laughing. The guards dragged him out screaming. I haven‚Äôt seen him since.


---

Then there was Whitaker.

A white boy from D-block who used to draw comics in the dayroom. Real talent. Funny dude. He disappeared during a fire drill, came back six days later with fresh bandages around both arms.

When the guards unshackled him, he didn‚Äôt say a word.

He just sat in the corner of the yard, drawing circles in the dirt. Not with a stick ‚Äî with his fingernail. Deep enough to bleed.

Rios and I watched from across the yard.

""You notice his pupils?"" Rios muttered.

I nodded. ‚ÄúToo big.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt see the whites anymore. Like he‚Äôs already underground.‚Äù

Later, Whitaker bit off a piece of his own tongue. Didn‚Äôt scream. Just chewed. Then smiled.

They sedated him in front of everyone.

No one laughed. No one even flinched.


---

I started keeping track.

Names. Behaviors. Notes scratched into the inside cover of a tattered Bible. Rios called it our ‚Äúlittle book of the damned.‚Äù

They were all floaters.

They were all gone between four and twelve days.

And they all came back with something missing. Or added.

Some talked to walls. One guy stopped sleeping entirely. Another started folding everything he touched ‚Äî toilet paper, clothes, food ‚Äî into precise, perfect squares. Then he shoved them in his mouth until his cheeks puffed out like a dead squirrel.

But none of them said anything about where they‚Äôd been.

Not until Delaney.


---

Delaney was a burner ‚Äî arson, second strike, no gang ties. Smart, quiet, kept to himself. One night, I saw him watching me through the rec cage wire.

Not looking.

Watching.

Eyes sharp, steady, alert. Not broken like the others.

The next morning, he was in the med line. I pulled Rios with me to get close.

He was muttering to himself ‚Äî not loud ‚Äî just under his breath.

But it wasn‚Äôt gibberish.

It was numbers.

‚ÄúThree floors down. Thirteen doors. Eight minutes between injections. Pain starts at minute five.‚Äù

Then he blinked like he just realized we were listening.

‚ÄúThey put something in me,‚Äù he whispered, staring straight at Rios. ‚ÄúI can feel it chewing when I sleep.‚Äù

Before we could ask more, the nurse called him forward. We never saw him again.


---

After that, Rios started sleeping less. He stopped joking. Stopped playing chess. He watched people like they were ticking.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not gonna find answers,‚Äù he said one night, ‚Äúuntil someone survives long enough to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs not gonna happen,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey make sure of it.‚Äù

He paused, then looked at me, voice low and cold.

‚ÄúUnless we find a way to make one talk.‚Äù


---

We didn‚Äôt have to wait long.

Two days later, we got a new cellmate.

He didn‚Äôt say a word when the guard dropped him off.

Just sat on the bottom bunk, breathing through his mouth, eyes flicking toward the corner of the room like something was waiting there.

His arms were covered in scar tissue. Fresh, angry, surgical-looking. His fingernails were cracked. His left pupil didn‚Äôt dilate right.

And his wrists‚Ä¶ they had the faint outlines of shackles. Inside the skin.

Rios gave me a look. I nodded back.

This one had come back.

And maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî he hadn‚Äôt finished breaking yet.


metallic scrape of our cell door sliding open and two guards in silence, hauling him in like dead weight.

No cuffs. No words.

They dumped him onto the bottom bunk ‚Äî my bunk ‚Äî and walked off without even looking at us.

He hit the mattress like a ragdoll. Didn‚Äôt even flinch. Just lay there with one arm twisted beneath him, eyes half-lidded, staring at the underside of Rios‚Äôs bunk above.

The door slammed shut.

We had a new roommate.


---

His name ‚Äî according to the ID tag zip-tied to his ankle ‚Äî was Jerome Ellis.

Float time: 11 days.

I recognized him. Sort of. We‚Äôd crossed paths during orientation. He‚Äôd had a stutter then, talked nervously, scratched his arms a lot.

Now‚Ä¶ now his hands stayed curled up tight, like he was holding onto something that wasn‚Äôt there.

That first night, he didn‚Äôt sleep. Not really. He just lay there, motionless, except for the occasional twitch in his cheek. Every now and then I‚Äôd catch a whisper slip from his mouth.

Not words.

Just a dry, rhythmic ""click-click-click.""

The same sound Darnell used to make.


---

By day three, the smell started.

It wasn‚Äôt strong ‚Äî not at first ‚Äî just‚Ä¶ wrong. Like antiseptic mixed with mold, with something sweeter underneath. Like meat left too long in a sealed fridge.

Rios noticed it too. He waited until lights out, then leaned close to me on the top bunk.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not right, hermano. Something‚Äôs eating at him. Inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúFiguratively?‚Äù

He just shook his head.

‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt think it is.‚Äù


---

On the fourth night, I woke to the sound of fabric tearing.

Jerome was hunched on the floor, his back to me, hands working furiously. I blinked the sleep out of my eyes and leaned over the edge of the bunk.

He‚Äôd ripped open the mattress.

Not like he was hiding something ‚Äî not like he was searching ‚Äî more like he was dissecting it.

And he was talking.

Low. Hypnotic.

‚Äú‚Ä¶can‚Äôt sleep or it wakes up, can‚Äôt sleep or it wakes up, can‚Äôt sleep‚Äî‚Äù

Rios dropped down from the top bunk and stood behind him.

‚ÄúJerome,‚Äù he said quietly, ‚Äúwhat did they do to you?‚Äù

Jerome didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúThey made a door. Said it was for healing. Said the body could hold more than pain if we just let go of the limits.‚Äù

His voice had this eerie calm to it. Like he was reciting a bedtime story.

‚ÄúBut the body isn‚Äôt empty. It never was.‚Äù


---

I crouched beside him.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the door, Jerome?‚Äù

His hands stopped moving.

He turned to me slowly ‚Äî eyes glassy, wet ‚Äî and smiled like a child caught doing something bad.

‚ÄúThey put it behind my ribs,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always open now.‚Äù

Then he grabbed my hand and shoved it under his shirt.

Not in a weird way ‚Äî not aggressive ‚Äî but like he needed me to feel it.

His chest was warm. Too warm. The skin pulsed unnaturally, like a second heartbeat had grown beside the first.

I jerked my hand away.

Rios stared down at him like he was trying to make a choice.

‚ÄúCan he tell us more?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs not done changing,‚Äù Rios muttered.

That‚Äôs when we heard it.

The scraping.


---

It came from inside the wall behind our bunk.

Slow at first. Deliberate.

Then faster. Clawing.

Jerome started whispering again.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open it, don‚Äôt open it, don‚Äôt open it‚Äî‚Äù

The cell light buzzed and popped. Out.

Dark.

Rios reached for the emergency buzzer.

It didn‚Äôt work.

We both backed into the corner as Jerome laughed ‚Äî not cruelly, but like someone remembering a joke from a dream.

The scraping stopped.

The wall went silent.

And then‚Ä¶ nothing.

Just darkness and breath.


---

The next morning, Jerome was gone.

No guards came. No keys. No doors opened.

He was just gone.

And the only proof he‚Äôd ever been there was the gutted mattress, the stink still clinging to the floor, and a single phrase carved into the concrete beneath the bunk.

‚ÄúTHE DOOR IS OPEN.‚Äù

1mh8fk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Complete_Education91/comments/1mh8fk0/another_shit_hole_almost_got_me/,Another shit hole almost got me.,"I am always conflicted when making reservations. When I started out on this journey in January, I'd say to myself 'You know you're going to going to order one pizza or cocktail too many; and, be assed out at the end of the month. Reserve your whole accommodations now. So, at the very least, you'll have guaranteed shelter.' 

Well, after several hit or misses--even when balancing many good guest ratings (from First World guests) vs budget--I've learned that making full month reservations online is not a smart move. I finally sorted to making a seriously micromanaged budget; and, doing one-night test reservations. And I'm already both saving money and enjoying myself!

The weekend reservation that I made was just to have a hotel close to the theme park. That allowed me to get the most out of the park; and, to take a good mid-day rest. 

The hotel I picked for the week, however--oh, no. Another one of these places that looks modern, and even futuristic, from the pics but you get there and 'hell no'. I wouldn't even waste an hour smashing someone in there. It's all bright colors and filled with natural light. That's great. Majes it easy to see the trails of rust stains running down the door; inexplicable stains on the wall; and, cascading calcium all over the floors. The building interior was the same as the room: heavily waterlogged and neglected until just recently. The bed linen had either oil or coffee stains rolled up in the duvet. 

Only good part was there were no awful smells; the bed and room itself was spacious; there was an actual table and chair in the room; and, the tea coffee set brand new and fully stocked.

After taking all the pics, I made another one-night reservation a mile away. Immediately checked out. And the staff seemed--hahaha--actually confused and hurt that I was checking out. I'm not in the middle of nowhere. This is a big, regional tourist destination. What did they expect based on what's being offered? And, I didn't mention, they had the nerve to ask for a cash deposit for damages upon check-in! Are you serious!? (Yes, they have it back.)

Anyway, I was off to the other hotel in no time. Checked-in. Had a rep come with me to the room to inspect. Perfect. Beautiful for the price! Which was a few dollars cheaper than the 'business friendly' travesty before. 

I looked left. Looked right. Checked everything again. Said f it and made an extended reservation. I'm VERY happy with this hotel. And I wish I'd stayed here the end of last month as well. The mid month reservation was romantic and comfortable but a little pricey and inconvenient.

End of month hostel...!? God help me. Never again! No matter how nice or run down a hostel or capsule hotel is, the other guest are usually very paranoid, wild and/or filthy. Islamabad and Kathmandu were my loveliest and funniest hostel experiences, respectively. I've been to maybe 8 hostels or capsule hotels in 10 years. Done.

So, now I'm going to enjoy a few lazy, clean, well-fed and clear schedule days for the week.

1mh8e9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1mh8e9i/the_ai_ide_reality_check_what_actually_works_and/,The AI IDE Reality Check: What Actually Works (And What's Just Hype),"Hey devs! üëã

So I've been knee-deep in the AI coding world for the past year, and honestly? Most of the ""tips"" you see online are either basic AF or straight-up don't work in real projects.

After burning through way too much time (and probably some brain cells) testing every AI IDE out there, here's what I've actually learned works ‚Äì not from some marketing blog, but from real use in production codebases.

# Let's Be Real About These Tools

**Cursor** is like that friend who's really good at one thing and won't shut up about it. It's genuinely amazing for new projects and solo work, but good luck getting it to understand your legacy enterprise codebase.

**Windsurf** feels like VS Code's older, more responsible sibling. It doesn't break as much, handles big projects better, but sometimes I miss Cursor's ""just works"" magic.

**GitHub Copilot** is the reliable friend everyone has. Not the most exciting, but it shows up when you need it. Plus if you're already married to the Microsoft ecosystem, why fight it?

**JetBrains AI Assistant** ‚Äì if you're one of those people who's used IntelliJ since 2010 and your muscle memory is locked in, this is your only real choice.

# The Setup Nobody Talks About

Here's the thing everyone glosses over: **setup is EVERYTHING**. I spent my first month thinking these tools were overhyped garbage because I was basically using them with default settings.

The pros spend like 80% of their time setting up rules and context, not actually coding. I know, I know ‚Äì not sexy, but it's the difference between ""this AI sucks"" and ""holy crap this just wrote my entire API layer.""

# Rules That Actually Matter

Look, don't go crazy with 50-page rule documents. Keep it simple:

    - Use TypeScript, not JavaScript
    - Always add error handling
    - Follow our existing naming conventions
    - Write tests for new functions
    - Don't use deprecated packages

That's it. The AI will pick up your patterns from context.

# Context is King (But Don't Go Overboard)

I learned this the hard way: keeping 47 files open doesn't make the AI smarter, it makes it confused. Keep your files under 500 lines, start fresh conversations regularly, and for the love of all that's holy, maintain a simple \[`README.md`\] that explains what your project does.

# What Actually Works in Practice

# The 40/20/40 Rule (That I Totally Made Up But Actually Works)

* 40% thinking about what you want and how to ask for it
* 20% waiting for the AI (grab coffee)
* 40% reviewing and fixing what it gave you

Anyone telling you to blindly accept AI code has never worked on a real project.

# Cursor Tricks That Don't Suck

* `Cmd+K` for quick inline edits (seriously, learn this shortcut)
* Use ""@""filename to include specific files when you need context
* Composer mode is genuinely magical for multi-file changes, when it works

# Windsurf Actually Useful Features

* The memory system that remembers how you like your code structured
* Cascade flows for chaining operations (sounds fancy, actually useful)
* YOLO mode when you're feeling dangerous

# Copilot for Grown-Ups

* Start your files with comments explaining what they do
* Use `/explain` when you inherit someone else's nightmare code
* The new agent mode is pretty sweet for handling full GitHub issues

# The Harsh Truth About Productivity

Recent study came out showing AI tools can actually make experienced devs 19% SLOWER. Why? Because we're treating them like magic wands instead of tools.

The developers crushing it with AI aren't the ones copy-pasting everything. They're the ones who:

* Actually understand what the AI generated
* Test everything immediately
* Use AI for the boring stuff (boilerplate, refactoring, documentation)
* Still think through the architecture themselves

# Mistakes I Made (So You Don't Have To)

1. **Vibe coding** ‚Äì just throwing random prompts and hoping for the best
2. **Context overload** ‚Äì giving the AI way too much information at once
3. **Tool ADHD** ‚Äì switching between tools every week instead of getting good at one
4. **Blind trust** ‚Äì using code I didn't understand (this bit me in production, don't do it)
5. **Ignoring my gut** ‚Äì if something feels wrong, it probably is

# My Actual Workflow (That Works)

1. **Pick ONE tool** and stick with it for at least a month
2. **Spend a day setting it up properly** (I know, boring, but do it)
3. **Start with refactoring existing code** ‚Äì less risky than new features
4. **Build the habit of reviewing everything** ‚Äì even the ""obvious"" stuff
5. **Keep learning** ‚Äì these tools change faster than JavaScript frameworks

# Real Talk: Is It Worth It?

Yes, but not in the way the marketing teams want you to think. AI IDEs won't make you a 10x developer overnight. They'll make the boring parts of coding less boring, help you explore ideas faster, and occasionally surprise you with something clever.

But you still need to know how to code. You still need to understand what you're building. And you definitely still need to test your stuff.

# What's Next?

The AI coding world is moving stupid fast. What works today might be outdated by the time you read this. But the fundamentals ‚Äì good setup, understanding your tools, reviewing your code ‚Äì those will always matter.

Been using AI IDEs? What's your experience? Did I miss something obvious? Let me know in the comments ‚Äì always looking to learn from fellow developers who are figuring this stuff out too.

Alright, friends, let‚Äôs be real for a second. Have you ever looked at your bank account after a month of creating content and gone, ‚ÄúWhat the heck happened here?‚Äù We‚Äôve all been there. **Creating can be costly.** Whether you‚Äôre dabbling in video, blog posts, or even just trying to keep your social media game strong, those expenses can pile up like dirty laundry! 

But here‚Äôs the good news: **AI is here to save the day!** üöÄ Yep, I said it. You can work smarter, not harder, and keep those pennies in your pocket. So grab your coffee (or tea, we don‚Äôt judge) and let‚Äôs dive into a few actionable ways to cut costs with the magic of AI!

### Here‚Äôs what you can do:

1. **Use AI for Content Creation**  
   - **Writing tools** like ChatGPT can whip up blog posts, scripts, or catchy social media captions in no time.
   - Ever tried using image generators? Tools like Midjourney or DALL-E can create stunning visuals without the need for a fancy camera!

2. **Automate Your Processes**  
   - **Scheduling**: Use platforms like Buffer or Hootsuite (some even have AI features now!) to schedule your posts and engage your audience while you sleep. Seriously, why wake up at 3 AM to post something?
   - **Email Marketing**: Automation tools can send out newsletters without requiring you to click ""send"" every time. 

3. **Optimize Your SEO**  
   - AI can analyze keywords faster than you can say ‚Äúsearch engine.‚Äù Tools like Surfer SEO or Jasper can help your content get noticed without hiring an expensive SEO expert. 

4. **Analyze Your Data**  
   - No more guesswork! Use AI analytics tools to find out what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs, well‚Ä¶ not. This means you focus on what actually resonates with your audience.

5. **Learning and Adapting**  
   - There are tons of courses out there that incorporate AI tools. Invest in a good one, and trust me, the return on investment will be worth it!

**And let‚Äôs not forget:** AI isn‚Äôt just a crutch; it‚Äôs like having a superhero sidekick. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You wouldn‚Äôt want to do this alone, would you? Imagine how much easier it will be to focus on your creativity instead of drowning in spreadsheets and marketing materials.

But, here's the kicker. This AI growth guide (wink wink) that I keep talking about is expiring soon! So, if you're like, ‚ÄúUh oh, I need to jump on this!‚Äù ‚Äî well, what's holding you back? 

Maybe fear? Or maybe you're thinking ‚ÄúAI just isn‚Äôt for me‚Äù? But let me tell you, you *can* do this. Everyone has to start somewhere, and the sooner you dip your toes into the AI pool, the faster you stop the money leak.

So, what‚Äôs super interesting is how many of us are in the same boat here ‚Äî struggling and hustling hard but not seeing the payoff we dream of. Have you started using any AI tools yet? What‚Äôs your biggest expense in creating? 

Here‚Äôs to working smarter, saving money, and watching our creative ventures grow! üéâ",1,1754298083.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1mh8dqs,https://i.redd.it/caxni0arwygf1.jpeg,First Impressions: Broken Relic Demo,"There are your run-of-the-mill first-day-on-the-job mistakes, like spilling coffee on the boss, sending the wrong email, or accidentally replying-all with a meme.

And then there‚Äôs accidentally releasing an unspeakable evil that‚Äôs been magically sealed away for centuries.

Same, but different.

In Broken Relic, the upcoming point-and-click adventure from solo developer Sandpenguin, you play as Tim, a well-meaning intern who manages to do exactly that‚Ä¶ before he‚Äôs even figured out where the staff kitchen is.

And frankly? I loved every second of it.

Tim‚Äôs first day at the Nytheris Archive, a glorified magical library stuffed with ancient relics, dusty tomes, and absolutely no health and safety protocols, goes from awkward to end-of-days real fast.

One wrong interaction, and the seal imprisoning the evil entity Kaelvorn shatters like your will to live during a Monday meeting.



But make no mistake: this game isn‚Äôt out to give you trauma. It‚Äôs here to make you laugh at the trauma.

**A Spiritual Successor to the Golden Age of Clicking on Everything**

Broken Relic wears its influences like a badge of honour (or perhaps like a soup pot on its head, more on that later).

From the moment the demo boots up, it‚Äôs clear this is a love letter to the 90s adventure game renaissance: King‚Äôs Quest, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle.

The kind of games where you clicked on everything because everything rewarded you with a quip, a joke, or an inventory item you had no business combining with a hamster.

The UI is unapologetically classic: left-click to interact, right-click for inventory, and a spacebar highlight function to save you from rubbing your mouse over every pixel like a medieval CSI.

No deaths, dead ends, or walkthroughs required ‚Äì just clever design and confident comedy.

And let‚Äôs talk about that comedy.



**Guybrush Energy, Main Character Problems**

Tim, voiced with perfect awkward charm by Gordon Williams, is the kind of protagonist who could absolutely burn down a village while trying to fix a door hinge.

He‚Äôs all good intentions and bad timing, the classic point-and-click archetype, but it‚Äôs the delivery that sells it.

It‚Äôs not just the writing, it‚Äôs the vibe.

At one point, Tim proudly dons a pot as a replacement for a missing helmet, like a kid showing off their macaroni art.

It‚Äôs stupid. It‚Äôs brilliant.

It‚Äôs Broken Relic in a nutshell.



**Clicks, Cackles, and Cooking Pots**

The Nytheris Archive is dense with interactables, all ripe for puzzle-solving or punchline farming.

If you‚Äôre the type to click on every bookshelf just to see what your character says about the smell of old paper (guilty), this is your playground.

There‚Äôs a generous hint of absurdity here. It‚Äôs not quite full Discworld, but it‚Äôs firmly in the ‚Äúlogical nonsense‚Äù zone where using a rubber chicken to cross a zipline makes perfect sense.

The puzzles are intuitive without being insulting, the worldbuilding has that cosy-weird energy, and even the tutorial bits feel like they‚Äôre in on the joke.

The best part? When the demo ends, the game literally breaks the fourth wall to beg you to wishlist it ‚Äì in full voice.

It‚Äôs shameless.

It‚Äôs perfect.



**Wishlist This Relic Immediately**

Broken Relic isn‚Äôt just a retro callback ‚Äì it‚Äôs a lovingly chaotic, laugh-out-loud resurrection of everything that made point-and-click adventures great in the first place.

The writing is sharp, the voice work is standout, and the overall tone walks that fine line between sincere and totally unhinged.

If you grew up yelling at your monitor because you couldn‚Äôt figure out how to combine a mop with a fish to make a grappling hook, this game will feel like coming home.

And if you didn‚Äôt? Well, welcome to the strange, beautiful world of clicking on things until the plot happens.

I'm thinking about starting a YouTube channel dedicated to Video Essays. These are not exceptionally informative of whatever, but sort of a random thoughts types. Think of them as more articulated versions of brainstorms over morning coffee.

I have jotted down the scripts of them and proofread them over and over and I think Video Essay on a YouTube is the best medium to get them out, rather than putting walls of text on Blogging Sites.

So, I settled down to recording, and it was a disaster. I could ot get my looks, voice or tone to match my vision. Made multiple attempts, but none of them matched the vision I had for the video versions.

So now I understand that I have no talent in the areas of Screen Presense, Delivery, Diction or Accent - at least in front of the camera. So frustraded, I tried a few AI powered TTS Engines, and I was genuinely surprised that how brilliantly the voice and delivery matched the expectations. So now, I have my scripts in the Audio format, just the way I wanted. I know, they are AI TTS, but at least they're better.

But still, the visuals are a big issue. What sort of visuals should I do ? I'm completely clueless about that, can anyone help me in that regard ?

Just to clarify, the audience for this is very limited, it's meant to be sparking a conversation and not out there just to get subs or views. But then again, for me, personally, the production quality of the videos could at least try to do the justice to the scripts.

I need all the help I can get. Please throw down ideas, and let's discuss !

Note : Already asked this and similar questions on a few YouTubing subs, but still looking for a fresh take from the most relevant community.  ",1,1754298062.0,videoessay,0,1.0,False

Buckle up - this is long and messy , also you may see some language or connection issues - english is my second language 

To start my relationship with my mom has always been messy . When I was young , I was very submissive Lets eat that ok ; lets stay home ok ; lets forget about piano , glasspainting and basically any hobby or activity that needed some money ok ok ok ... lets make you a doctor ok ( and by the way i made it thru med school 26 F now) I wanted her to love me after all my dad works in a different country , i am stuck with her , young me thought this was a way to peace 

I suffered through study , she always gave comments along the lines of you're a stupid piece of shit , youre a failure. It is not like i hate to study , on contrary i loved exploration , loved specific fields - specific sciences and topics - aka I was just picky and had trouble sitting still to do homework ,assignments or a full task ... 

Where I live , schools are well aware ; they suggested ADHD and basically kind of forced to make her allow me to see a therapist   ( that is a very long trip to the diagnosis - left for later but imagine 3 years to convince her that I was not stupid and had real potential . JUST NEEDED THERAPY - CBT AND POSSIBLY A PILL IF NEEDED !

I remember dayss she used to fight with my dad on his vacations bcz he treats me good - her exact words "" youre treating her too good"" Dad was aware of her actions , he wanted to compensate hed go make up shopping , ice cream dates , hear bout my love life and do basically every thing that youd ever do with your mom .Btw he cant divorce her not before not now - he is the bread winner but he loved her so much and also he put every single asset on her name - divorce is not plausible not heart not financial it doesnt work ... I don't know if he really thinks about the financial part but i thought maybe this would help imagine the size of control she has over the household in all and my dad non the less.

She once hit me with leather waist belt hard enough and multipple times to the point that i called my teacher and things escalated to my country's CPS equivalent - However , in my country , you sign something very similar to a restraining order especially if the other parent doesnt live in the same house

As i moved forward , All this initiated my depression . I live with someone who is upsset that i exist , I have issues i cant resolve on my own - not as a minor ( cant get a job , even if i tried i will not be allowed to work according to her because what would pepeple say i left you to starve so you would work your ass off !) 

PS - she is REAL wealthy - she just likes to skip on whatever i need or want ! 

Anyway , I went to college , medschool it was tough , but at least I had insurance that she had no clue off , treated depression and ADHD without drama ..thanK GOD. 

Of course all thru the college years , youre terrible youre a disaster vibe but I already spent all day at the hospital , she wont see me wont say anyrthing .. avoding her at all times . I even took shifts that i didnt have to to stay out of the house. In college , i learned to stand up for my self , and that parenthood is not that .. I started to have my own belief system which is basically her total opposite ..She didnt like that HOW DARE I HAVE A PERSONALITY OR THE GUTS TO SAY NO TO BEGIN WITH From that time , despite toxic I started to find my survival mode buttons . 

A few days  however - she wanted to set me up with a friends son. I dont know the guy , he could be perfect. However , i am in a stable relationship . We see moving forward but given I still didn't find my way into med residency and financial stability and his messy schedule too - were good the way we are till we figure things out . She doesnt know that . Shed would want to know him , HIS Financial status , yes financial status ""her words"" , his family and too much .. I wouldn't tell her as I would want to stand by my choice not to but SHE WILL FIND OUT 

I said NO - idont want to go on a date with that guy who she wanted to set me up in the first place. 

How dare I ? 

**SHE REPLIED "" you are nuts documented on file - malfunctioning without a pill youd be to the garbage . If you mind adding up youre propably an infertile slut with your premature systems""** 

**I said - SAYS an uneducated ignorant self-unaware supposedly adult**

**HER : I am sure that my friend would think that youre incapable of having children ; shed defintely find your medical records "" Mocked with her hand signs and face for CRAZY""** 

**ME: YOURE A NARCSISST covering your educational** incompetence **- youre not emotionally socially or scientfically educated . You know nothing about motherhood or life to begin with . The fact that you think someone else will think of any of that or even that this is a thought process of a sane human is ridiculous - you need therapy** 

**( She has been always insecure about the fact that she finished high school then a year program or something - she was never accepted to uni and projected that in every conversation think like why you need a doctor ; I know should take so and so lterally with anyone even a barista handing her coffee or a valet a cashier a family member possibly all her barbie dolls too)** 

**HER : I am not crazy you are** 

**ME : you should burn in hell** 

She started sobbing and demanded that i leave the house immediately, My dad showed up and the end and convinced her to wait till next summer - to figure my med residency issue out (It is annual in the US where i am applying  btw and I have been applying for 3 years now- kindly wish me that it works out bcz it is technically either that or ill be staying on the streets next summer) 

Note i am super happy i am finally allowed to move out but will not happen if i don't get accepted into residency in the states ( I am middle eastern - it is not allowed usually ; also please dont blame her crap on the culture people where i live are nice with their families , they have deep family connections and they are ambitious and good enough like every other human anywhere else - forget about media ) 

I dont know if this is a detail that should go somewhere - may be significant background. As a newborn , i was born like on the 28th week -terribly prremature , NICU and years of physical therapy , eye surgeries .. orthopedic interventions . She always gave me that sentence I wish i never fought for you , i wish you died in the hospital back then 

IF this story makes it to the youtube channel - remind me I only do youtube an hour a week and mostly its you Charlotte :)))))

Also , please wish me luck on that residency MATCH cycle

Fairly new to gaming this year and have my set ups and game types pretty sorted, all apart from a game if I'm chilling on the sofa and want to grab the deck for 5/10 mins.

Portal - Will grind the souls game I'm playing on the sofa etc.... when I don't have distractions

Steam Deck - Witcher 3 - when i can sit and focus like a plane/coffee shop etc....

What I'm looking for is if I have 5-20 mins where I don't want to doom scroll and just want to grab the deck and play something but in a chaotic house with toddlers - The Witcher 3 seems too story intense and I need to focus and immerse myself. Have tried hollow knight and darkest dungeon but didn't really enjoy them. Was thinking perhaps getting a sports game but would love some suggestions, I don't think I like the metrodvania and getting lost etc.....

Also a game where my 4 year old wants to watch and get involved - tried the lego games but they're a bit too combat/violent so any other suggestions please",2,1754297559.0,ShouldIbuythisgame,2,1.0,False

Fast forward a year or more‚ÄîI went to a ramen restaurant with my sister and her boyfriend. When we walked in, I saw our waitress and thought, Why does she look so familiar? I didn‚Äôt think much of it and just ordered my food.

Later, when she came by to check on us, she looked at me and said, ‚ÄúHey, not to be weird or awkward, but are you the guy that used to come to [XYZ Caf√©] to study a lot?‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù And then she said, ‚ÄúI used to work there!‚Äù That‚Äôs when it clicked‚Äîit was the same girl.

But now I‚Äôm conflicted. Part of me feels like she was just being nice, but the other part of me has had this little crush on her.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal coffee filter for a Cuisinart machine should offer a combination of filtration efficiency, durability, and ease of use.

**Material:** The material of the filter, be it paper or metal, significantly impacts the coffee's flavor profile. Paper filters tend to absorb oils and sediments, resulting in a cleaner cup of coffee, while metal filters allow more oils and fine particles to pass through, producing a bolder, richer flavor. Paper filters are usually made from bleached or unbleached paper, with unbleached options being more environmentally amiable. Metal filters are typically constructed from stainless steel or gold-plated mesh.

**Filtration Efficiency:** The filtration efficiency of a coffee filter affects the amount of sediment and oils in the final brew. A filter with tighter pores or a finer mesh will capture more sediment, resulting in a smoother cup of coffee.Consider the micron rating for reusable filters, which measures the size of particles the filter can effectively trap. Lower micron numbers indicate finer filtration and reduced sediment.

**Compatibility:** A coffee filter must be compatible with your specific Cuisinart coffee maker model. Most Cuisinart coffee makers use either cone-shaped filters (typically size #4) or basket-shaped filters. Ensure the filter's dimensions match the filter basket in your machine to prevent leaks or overflows during brewing.

**Durability:** Reusable filters,in particular,must be durable enough to withstand repeated washing and use. Look for filters made from high-quality materials, such as surgical-grade stainless steel, that are resistant to corrosion and wear. The filter's construction should also be robust enough to maintain its shape and integrity over time.

**Ease of cleaning:** Reusable filters should be relatively easy to clean after each use. Filters with smooth surfaces and minimal crevices are generally easier to rinse and scrub. Some reusable filters are also dishwasher-safe, providing an added level of convenience.

**Environmental Impact:** Consider the environmental impact of disposable coffee filters versus reusable options. Disposable paper filters contribute to paper waste, while reusable filters offer a more enduring choice. If choosing paper filters, opt for unbleached options and consider composting them after use.

Key features to consider for coffee filters for Cuisinart coffee makers:

*   Precise fit for Cuisinart models
*   High Filtration efficiency for smoother taste
*   Durable Construction
*   Easy Cleaning Design
*   Environmentally responsible choice

## Core Benefits

Switching to a superior coffee filter can drastically improve your coffee experience and make your daily routine something to look forward to.

**enhanced Flavor:** The right coffee filter can extract the optimal flavor from your coffee grounds. Paper filters create a cleaner, brighter flavor by removing oils, while metal filters produce a bolder, richer taste. Experimenting with different filter types can help you discover your preferred flavor profile.

**Reduced Sediment:** A high-quality filter minimizes sediment in your coffee, resulting in a smoother, more enjoyable drinking experience. Reusable filters with a fine mesh or paper filters with a tight weave are particularly effective at trapping fine grounds. This helps avoid the gritty texture that can detract from the overall enjoyment.

**Cost Savings:** While reusable filters may have a higher upfront cost, they prove more economical in the long run by eliminating the need to constantly purchase disposable paper filters. Over time, the savings can be significant, especially for frequent coffee drinkers. Think about how often you purchase coffee filters; the price adds up quickly!

**Environmental friendliness:** Choosing a reusable filter reduces waste compared to disposable paper options. This simple switch helps to minimize your environmental impact and promotes sustainability. The difference you make can be substantial over time.

**Ease of Use:** Many modern coffee filters are designed for easy use and cleaning. Disposable filters require minimal setup and are easily disposed of after use,while high-quality reusable filters are often dishwasher-safe,simplifying the cleaning process.

## FAQs Section

**Are all coffee filters the same size for Cuisinart coffee makers?**
No, cuisinart coffee makers utilize either cone-shaped or basket-shaped filters, and the size can vary depending on the specific model. Most models use either a #4 cone filter or a standard basket filter. Always check your coffee maker's manual or the manufacturer's website to confirm the correct filter size.

**How often should I replace my reusable coffee filter?**

Although stainless steel filters can last longer, accumulated oils and residue can affect the filter's performance over time, ultimately affecting your coffee's taste. Inspect the filter regularly for any signs of damage, such as tears or deformation, and replace it as needed.

**Can I use paper filters in a Cuisinart coffee maker designed for reusable filters, and vice-versa?**
Generally, it's not recommended.Coffee makers designed for reusable filters often have a mesh basket or a different design that may not properly support paper filters, which could lead to overflow or uneven extraction. Conversely,trying to use a reusable filter with a machine designed for paper filters may result in inadequate filtration or damage to the machine. It is significant to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for your specific model.

**How do I clean my reusable coffee filter properly?**
To properly clean a reusable coffee filter, rinse it thoroughly with hot water after each use to remove any coffee grounds or residue.periodically, you can soak the filter in a solution of water and baking soda or vinegar to remove stubborn stains and oils.Ensure the filter is wholly dry before storing it to prevent the growth of mold or mildew. Follow the manufacturer's specific cleaning instructions to maintain the filter's performance and lifespan.

A tale of incest/family trauma/medical malpractice/political adversary & touching reunions (long post),"**Disclaimer** havent read through any other posts on this page but just a heads up this will be pretty graphic + tmi, I suffer from intense anxiety and am panicking right now so I gotta lay it all on the table

I know the only way ill get a for sure answer is when I go back to the ER tomorrow (was already at the ER once and urgent care twice in the past week) but any advice in the meantime would definitely help me calm down

the best way for me to explain all of this would be to go in chronological order from start to finish. before I start I already know some of the choices ive made throughout this were morally wrong/flat out stupid.

I recently just turned 28 years old. one day when I was around 11-12 years old I was visiting some family with my mother, she would pick out my clothes for me when going to more formal gatherings at that age. I vividly remember that particular day she had me wearing a pair of jeans i hadnt worn in a while, that were definitely fitting tighter than I would have liked, but knew better than to object to my extremely strict family. that night at my grandmas i remember when i went to sit on the couch i sat down super quick and a testicle must have been in the wrong position I just remember an EXTREMELY sharp pain in my left testicle (im assuming in got clenched in between the jeans and my leg.) I immediately jumped up and ran to the bathroom to inspect and right away felt that the testicle had been damaged severely.  Extremely painful to touch and it felt mishaped (imagine a balloon 3/4 full of air and then taking the neck of the balloon and tying it around the middle so that you have two little balls of air,) that comparison is definitely a little exaggerated (it didnt feel like my testicle was completely seperated in half) but thats the closest comparison of feeling i can think of. I remember being in the bathroom in silent agony for at least 15 min before the pain became bearable enough to return to the living room with my family and act normal. Being raised in a foreign family talks of medical issues always felt taboo especially something like this, with my mom. My dad has worked out of the country my whole life I only see him a couple times a year, I could call him and talk whenever I wanted but I definitely didnt feel comfortable enough to open up to him about this when it happened. Due to my bright pre-teen mind I tried to JO when I got home a couple hours later through the pain and was able to ejaculate, so I told myself I was good everything was going to be fine. The pain started to go away by the next day and within a couple days it felt like it was completely gone (except when id apply pressure to that testicle, which still remains true to this day.) After that I never even thought about this incident again until a few years later when I started becoming sexually active. I only just opened up to my mother about what happened about 2 years ago.

I started dating some girl seriously (as serious as can be for that age) 2-3 years later and made sure to tell her, and every partner ive had since just to be gentle with my testicles when having sex. Our relationship lasted around 3 years and ended when I admitted out of guilt that I had cheated on her during our first year being together. I had hooked up with a 19 year old girl when I was 15 that I had met through mutual friends. We were the same ethnicity and our ethnic community is very tight so I had always known of her since as far back as memory goes, and had always had a crush on her; she was and still is a fashion model who is actually pretty regionally famous in my area of the country. Quickly after our little entanglement I was hanging out with her at her house and her mom told us that we were actually pretty closely related - which I did confirm with my own family afterwards. Neither sides knew that we were more than just friends though but we cut off any sex between us after that and soon after stopped talking completely.  (Itll make sense why knowing this is important later.)

By the time my relationship ended around me turning 17 those 2 girls were the only sex partners I had up until that point. And I am 99.9% sure that the first girl had lost her virginity to me and had not been with anyone else throughout our relationship. Things ended off badly and toxically though, and we completely lost contact after that. 

Throughout the next 10 years my life carried on like normal, no interruptions or changes in my sexual activity. I do not know an exact number but a safe estimate of sexual partners i‚Äôve had is 50, give or take 10. Besides maybe 10-15 of those partners most were one night stands who i‚Äôve had little to no contact with afterwards, even out of those 10-15 who were friends or girlfriends I had at the time, not a single person has ever told me i‚Äôve given them a std or that they got one after being with me. Also during this time, but I can‚Äôt remember exactly when, occasionally the testicle that I had hurt when I was young would start to get painful with no major force/pressure being applied to it. Sometimes the pain lasts minutes and goes away, sometimes it might persist for a couple days. I used to be a heavy partier/go out every day type person, and I am definitely more susceptible to getting the pain if im wearing tighter pants and moving around a lot in them, or sleeping in uncomfortable positions/on couches, ect. Sometimes I only feel the pain in the testicle, and sometimes I could even feel it in the tube going up into my pelvis. I‚Äôd say this happens every 3-4 months.  

Also during these next 10 years I started dabbling in drugs, it wasn‚Äôt long before I became a full blown opiate & benzo addict. For those that arent real familiar with how opiates affect your body one of the worst side effects it gives you is constipation; I have experienced constipation so bad from this at times that it has given me pelvic pain that feels really similar to the pelvic pain caused from the teste injury. Thank god I kicked the habit (sort-of) as I am still using suboxone (an opiate blocker that still gives you a lot of the side effects of regular opiates) so I still do deal with the constipation to this day, but not as bad. Its not so much that I can‚Äôt go at all, but I definitely dont use the bathroom as much as I would be if I were completely clean (there has been couple month periods of complete sobriety throughout the past 10 years.) 

Around a year and a half ago I had one of those outbursts of pain in the testicle, but this time it lasted for multiple weeks, it would come and go throughout the day, but did happen every day. Worried, I finally decided to get it checked out and made an appointment with a urologist. They did some urine tests when I went in, and had me come back a couple days later to do a complete x ray of my testicles. When I went back in to get the results the doctor told me that I definitely damaged it, but that I would be fine and didn‚Äôt require more treatment than taking moltrin when needed for the pain. He said he checked for testicular cancer too and said there was no cancer. According to him, the amount of damage I had done was common in men it was something like 15-20% of men have damaged a testicle as bad as I did and are all completely fine. He did say I could get it surgically fixed if I wanted, but recommended against because I would be in excruciating pain for about 6 months recovering. In his own words he said the pain was not worth the reward. He did tell me the exact condition I had, and I regret that I never asked for any paperwork from them with my results information because I cannot remember exactly what it‚Äôs called. I know it started with a B, something like branchioitis/bronchioitis. I tried looking it up as soon as I left the office but could not figure out how to spell it lol

For the past year or two I have slowed down significantly on partying/going out, and in turn am a lot less sexually active (maybe 2-3 partners tops a year these past few years.) Also when I quit opiates & xanax a year ago I got prescribed adderall to regulate my energy levels which affects my ability to focus/comprehend. The adderall has been a life changer for sure, but it has tremendously lowered my sex drive, to the point that sometimes I can‚Äôt get erect even when I want to/should be able to. When I try to have sex or JO on adderall and am unable to, I notice a slight pain in the injured testicle, but definitely not as bad as when it happens randomly the couple times a year.

Ok finally let‚Äôs fast forward to the present. About 2 weeks ago I met a girl at the beach and we just got off very well. She ended up staying at my house the rest of the week. Nothing happened the first 2 days and she ended up getting her period, but for the next few days she did give me oral sex every day. 

Exactly 3 days after our last day together, I noticed it burning when I went to pee. I didnt think much of it that night, I thought I was just dehydrated from working a couple 12 hour shifts in a row and not drinking enough water through it, which has happened a couple times before. I made sure to chug 2 glasses of water before passing out. Next morning, same thing, just worse. This time the pain was pretty bad, I knew it had to be something else and started to intentionally hold it in until I couldn‚Äôt any longer so I didn‚Äôt have to feel the burn. Later on in the day while I‚Äôm at work I go to pee and I see a bunch of thick yellowish discharge in my boxers and dripping out of the head. I squeezed my shaft a little and even more started coming out. 

I instantly started panicking and left work to go to the urgent care. What do you know when I get there I find out that I had been kicked off my medicaid!!! Thanks Donny. A couple months ago I was in a car accident and without a car/job for around 3 months (my job is over a hour away from my home so ubering every day would have made me spend more money than I was even making.) I only just started working again a month ago, and had to borrow money from a family member to get a car before my bank account went negative. So with  considerable debts on my shoulders, no insurance to make an appointment with my PCP, no money to pay for urgent care out of pocket, my only option was to go to the ER.

Right when I get to the ER I see it‚Äôs packed. I quickly find out there‚Äôs only one doctor on the premise, and every staff member is visibly distressed. After hours I finally get called back, I don‚Äôt even get put in a room but get put on a chair against the wall behind the receptionist desk, with other patients a couple feet away from me on each side, with only a curtain dividing us. Already I start getting anxiety about having to talk to the doctor about this with absolutely no privacy. Multiple hours go by again before the doctor even comes up to me, and I told him about the burning and discharge. He asked me if I had any new partners recently and told him about the girl I had just met. I give him a urine sample and he told me he‚Äôd be back as soon as my results were ready. 

While i‚Äôm waiting I talked to the girl I had just met and told her exactly what‚Äôs going on. She told me she would be very surprised if she had a STD, as she‚Äôs only had 3 other sex partners in her life + gets a check up at the gyno yearly and hasn‚Äôt had sex since her last appointment. I know I just met her but my gut made me feel like she was telling the truth, and I consider myself a pretty good lie detector. She is quite younger than me (10 year age gap) and grew up with strict foreign parents, just like me. Even though I felt like she wasn‚Äôt lying, I pressed the matter on her and she agreed to at least get checked out again (she still hasnt though and its been a good week since I went to the ER)

I stayed in that same chair throughout the night and when its almost dawn the next day the doctor comes back and tells me I tested positive for a UTI, and the STI results would be a little longer. He has me pull down my pants gives each testicle a light squeeze, as well as pushing on my pelvis area. I felt no pain with each attempt (including the damaged testicle.) He tells me that‚Äôs a good sign, but that I probably still have chlamydia or gonorrhea.

The doctor, visibly flustered with his workload apologizes for all the waiting and says he feels bad to make me wait a couple more hours. He said he was going to give me a shot as well as an antibiotic prescription that would cover the UTI, AND chlamydia + gonorrhea if I ended up having either of them. He said he was going to go get someone to give me the shot and disappears again for several hours. 

When he finally comes back he apologizes again and says i‚Äôm about to be getting discharged. He gives me a orange pill that he said would get rid of the burning sensation but that it was only a mask and wouldn‚Äôt cure anything. He then says he sent over 2 antibiotics to my pharmacy and that I‚Äôm good to go now. He also said the pill he just gave me would turn all my bodily fluids (urine, saliva, tears) orange and not to panic when it does, but it never did.

Before I leave I ask him ‚Äúso all I gotta do is finish both courses of antibiotics and i‚Äôll be good?‚Äù obviously I was wondering why I wasn‚Äôt getting the injection he said he went to go get, but due to me not wanting to wait another 3 hours, and me passing out the last time I got a shot, I did not directly ask about the injection. He assured me though that the antibiotics was all I needed, because, he stressed, the pill he gave me was good for chlamydia AND gonorrhea. On my discharge paperwork my follow up instructions only say to see a doctor or specialist if i was referred to one (I wasn‚Äôt,) and to contact a doctor if my condition worsens. I leave, go home, take a nap, then go get my prescriptions.

I was given 7x 500mg cephalixin capsules  once a day, and 28x 100mg doxycycline capsules 4x a day. By the 2nd day on the meds the burning and discharge completely stopped and I was feeling good about everything. But the antibiotics were so harsh on my body to the point I felt extreme fatigue and nausea that I had to take the entire week off work until I finished them. I couldn‚Äôt really afford to do that but decided I had to prioritize my health first. I was so fatigued from the antibiotics that I literally slept the first 85 hours, only somehow gathering the energy to refill my water to take my meds, use the bathroom and take a quick snack. I did not even have a strength to make myself a meal the entire week. 

On the 6th day I got a letter in the mail from my county health department saying I had a communicable disease, and to give them a call as soon as possible. The next morning I call them and talk to the nurse. She asked me what meds they gave me and after telling her she sounded pretty surprised and confused saying that none of the meds I was prescribed would get rid of the gonorrhea, which is what I tested positive for. She told me there is a shot I can take, or a different kind of antibiotic that would also work. 

I call the ER and get put on the line with a pretty rude receptionist, right from the start. I explained to her how I was in there a week ago and the conversation I just had with the health department. She looks up my file and says that their records show that they offered me the shot when I was in the ER, but I denied it, as well as denying some other test the doctor supposedly offered me. Neither or these were true and I told her that, which pissed her off. Rudely she told me I‚Äôll have to come back there to get the shot. I explained to her how that ER was over an hour away from my work, and that I barely had the strength to get out of bed let alone drive that far so if there was any way the doctor could send the right antibiotic prescription to the pharmacy by my house instead that was really the only option I had. She said only the doctor who did my test can see the results and that he wasn‚Äôt in today, and the doctor that was there wasn‚Äôt going to write me a prescription ‚Äújust because I asked for it.‚Äù I ask her, how can‚Äôt the doctor that‚Äôs there see my results if I took the tests in that hospital? Because I never signed any release forms she said, something else that was never offered to me there. Feeling frustrated and defeated I sarcastically thanked her for her time and hung up, not knowing what to do. 

The next day I returned to work feeling recharged from finishing the antibiotics (the health department nurse told me to finish them since there was only one day left when I talked to her.) I get paid daily at my job so the next day I was able to afford an urgent care visit and explained to them everything that had happened the past few weeks. They were going to give me the shot right then and there, but I explained how I passed out the last time I saw a needle go in me and if it would be just as effective to prescribe the antibiotics instead. Thankfully she did and she gave me 4x 500mg Azithromycin, which I should take all at once. She said after 3-4 days the infection will be gone. Before leaving I asked her if it‚Äôs a good idea for me to set up a day to come back and get tested to make sure I test negative, and she told me theres no need, the infection will go away.

It‚Äôs been 2 days since I took them and completely out of the blue, my very first girlfriend that I hadn‚Äôt talked to in 10 years unblocks and adds me on instagram. We start catching up on our lives and she tells me she regrets not telling me that I gave her an STD when we were together. She didn‚Äôt tell me exactly which one because we were just catching up on so many different topics but that made me think‚Ä¶. what if i‚Äôve had this for over 10 years now? I‚Äôve been reading up on STD‚Äôs throughout the week while I‚Äôve been home so I know that there is complicated and uncomplicated gonorrhea. I start to wonder, what if the epididymitis pain I feel occasionally was from gonorrhea, and not from the testicle injury? 

I know for a fact that when I first got the injury, those random outbursts of pain didn‚Äôt start until a couple years later, once I had become sexually active. I do not remember exactly how many years it took but I know for sure it was at least 3-4 years after‚Ä¶. which coincidentally lines up with the time I had cheated on the girlfriend, and which would also make it complicated, not uncomplicated.

From the research I did the antibiotics I have taken so far alone is not enough to get rid of complicated gonorrhea. And what do you know for the past hour I got another one of those outbursts of pain in my testicle, all the way up to my entire pelvis. That‚Äôs what lead to me actually making this post because the pain started as soon as I got home from work and changed out of my work clothes. The pants I have to work in are kinda tight fitting, but I wear them every shift so its not like that alone has been enough to make it hurt in the past. Like as soon as I took the pants off the pain came on, AND there was a pea sized discharge spot in my boxers, definitely not even close to the amount of discharge I had before, but it was still there.

I‚Äôm worried that I still may have gonorrhea, or even worse, gave it more resistance to the antibiotics by taking them and not getting rid of the completely. I just don‚Äôt know what to do next, any advice will help and if you took the time to read this I really appreciate you. If I have had gonorrhea all this time it‚Äôs just so weird to me that I only started feeling burning and having discharge after the last partner I encountered. Also with all the partners I‚Äôve had in the past not one of them say something to me? I know most were one night stands with people i barely knew but I did have another multi year relationship after that first one, and never heard anything about it from her or noticed a difference in her vagina. Unfortunately she tragically passed away in a car accident 6 years ago so I can‚Äôt ask her. But another one of my old sex partners remains one of my best friends to this day, and she definitely would tell me if I gave her something or even if she caught a STD and didn‚Äôt know where it came from.

I am going to be going to grab some coffee with my first ex tomorrow so I hope to get some clarification on what it was exactly she‚Äôs been told I gave her, but for now all I can hope for is some replies on here.

Have a blessed day and thank you to every response ahead of time.

X talk, the truth is I was very blunt, according to her, I am too reserved with people I don't know because of problems from the past, so when I got home I told my parents and my dad, since he is a busybody, convinced me to win her over, my mistake, I resisted because I didn't feel anything for her, I didn't even run into her! And yes, I'll let them blame me, but my dad is... How to say it? A little boy, he can't stand being told no, he made a huge drama, and well, I reluctantly accepted, with her help and her interest we became a couple, in 4 days! Mistake, I didn't know her well, we were on vacation so I only saw her on the fifth day and we became a couple, and I'll tell you something, I was never rude after what happened on Instagram on the first day, then I said, well, we're a couple, right? I will give my all, and yes, everything for the relationship, I was with her as much as I could, I listened to what she talked about and gave my opinion, I gave her gifts, her cuddles, I made her laugh, and well I fell, I fell in love, but after a month the beginning of the decline began, she started talking about her ex, always bad things but she always brought him up and it made me uncomfortable, I told her that I didn't like her talking about him all the time, she ignored me, then when I asked her about her day she told me that she spent time in a park with her friends who were stepping on each other's shoes, honestly I'm not jealous, but with a cool time I spent with my friends it was okay, it made me uncomfortable when she said things like that, trying to make me jealous, she was looking for a jealous man, why? Because she would tell me later, in a message, hey, will you let me go out with so-and-so friend? Well, why do you ask me? I'm not an authority figure for you, and that's how it was, the worst? He was uncomfortable with Ruby, with Ruby he was very flirtatious BEFORE being with her and I repeat BEFORE being with Jimena, I STOPPED when we became boyfriend and girlfriend, Jimena was in the second year and I was in the first year, and Ruby and I were in the same class, so I spent time with her since she was the only friend I had, except for the other two who spent time away from us, so she was my only company, Jimena was bothered by it, I looked at Ruby ugly from afar, and she even told me that Ruby made her uncomfortable, oh and I became a friend long before I met Jimena, she was a chubby girl who I got along really well with, we threw hateful glances or made disgusted moves at each other, always playing or then we raised our fingers to each other, but always very respectful to each other, she was happy to know that I had a girlfriend but when Jimena saw her ... You could see the true disgust on her face, then suddenly that friend stopped talking to me, now I know that Jimena He told her not to talk to me or get close to me again, then the inevitable happened, one day she was trying to make me jealous but my dad took my phone and defended me by pretending to be me, and I told her to please stop that it made me uncomfortable and that's when a fight started, from there the fragile feelings I had for her had their first crack, I tried to invite her thousands of times to go out on dates, but she came out with: I can't, or I'm at church, 
(She is a Christian and I am an atheist but that never bothered me, that caused me to have constant fights with my dad because he didn't approve of her being a Christian and told me to break up and throw in his face that he made me go out with her and that she should put up with it, that caused months of very strong fights between the two of us) Then one day she dropped the bomb on me without anesthesia, we were calmly watching the landscape from the third floor of the school and she told me: we need some time, I told my parents about our thing and they didn't approve because of our religions, I told her how about I talk to them so they could see that I wasn't a bad person, and a thousand other things to see if it would be resolved, but no no and no, and well then another rift came out and I told her, okay, go on, take care of yourself. And there I went to my classroom, I must have looked rude but I gave her a thousand solutions, I talked to Ruby about it and she said that since then, and in the remaining 6 hours of school, well, I didn't want to talk to her, I needed to think a little and process the information, and then my cousin comes to ask why I was ignoring her and I told her everything, she told me that it was okay, and during recess I was going to the cooperative for a chocolate bread and while I was going Aron crossed my path and started to ""talk"" to me and without knowing my ex came from behind and hugged me, there Aron left and left me alone with her (it was a plan I suppose between them, since they knew each other) so she used my weak points against me and we went back, the truth is mentally I was very weak, and here falls the third problem 1 week later, a classmate named Sasha, quite beautiful and a person from my class who I swear that until that day I had never spoken to her sent me on Instagram responding to a dark souls story that I uploaded an I love you, the true e have to admit that I'm handsome but no one had ever told me something like that out of the blue, so I didn't know how to react and I instantly went to Jimena and told her what do I say? Well if I said something about myself, she was going to be very cruel, normally I don't measure my words and it ended up sounding ugly, but I'm not like that, then Juli tells me, do whatever you want with the most contemptuous tone and left me there, alone without help, I asked my cousin and a friend of hers what was up why she acted like that? And I asked them if I did something wrong, and they told me no, and they went to talk to her, with the help of my mom and Ruby (I had to call her) I answered her if she also liked dark souls. Why did I ask that? Well I thought maybe she didn't mean it literally but to my story as such, and she already answered me yes, but apparently it wasn't Sasha but a friend who uses her account, why? Who knows, and she passed me an account made at that time with the photo of a woman's hand petting a Husky, according to that was her original account, I did not speak to her again, because I was in a relationship and did not want to be flirted with, at night my ex apologized very reluctantly, here comes the fourth problem, Jonathan arrived when we were in our couple moments and the atmosphere was screwed, and I talked to Jimena and between the two they left me aside, but I held on, I listened to her EVERYTHING, I gave my opinion, I investigated, I watched a BORING series that I hated just to have something to talk about with her, and when I told her something I liked or something like that she did not pay attention to me and changed the subject to something of hers, there a bigger crack was generated, and the last blow to my feelings that with so much effort to build to love her were broken, on Valentine's Day I understand that not all of us have to give, but listen to this, I gave her a stuffed animal, chocolates, flowers and a medieval type letter with a poem telling her all my love and a 7x7 mini painting of her made days in advance and very well done, all of that with the money that cost me so much work in the work, because yes, although I don't lack money I like to work, and instead of buying the hats that I love so much I bought her all of that, and I at least wanted a pretty face that anyone could do, or better yet for her to make me something, a mini song or something, since she studies music there, I will study visual arts, do you know what she gave me? A notebook letter with the word I love you written 27 times with different markers, I'm not interested in expensive gifts but not a show of affection, not a little letter, she received my gift with a dry thank you disguised as love and the chocolates I gave her she distributed them among her friends, and the worst thing is that she left me aside, and I only heard how they discredited the beautiful stuffed animal I bought her, that's when everything broke, I stopped loving her that day, the next 5 days I no longer spoke to her on my own, and she seemed to be affected, and one day when I spent the whole day with Ruby planning how to end it, on the way out I was intercepted by Jimena asking me why I was being so cold and there with great shame I told her that it was no longer working, without blaspheming her for all the problems she caused me, because all the stress that being with her caused me was worse than the stress of school itself, being with her was already like an obligation to me, I was no longer the same as before, the playful and silly boy with her friends, now I was a bitter man who had no time because she would get angry if I wasn't with her, then ignore me when I was with her, she left crying and that's when I felt like I was free, I finally felt free, the next day my cousin asked me why I cut her off, I told her the truth and she accepted it, then my ex arrived and asked me why I said things weren't working out, and well I just told her that I didn't feel like this would work anymore, just so I wouldn't throw everything I felt in her face, and what made her disgust me is that after ONE week she got with Jonathan, did I get angry? No, it was more like woman disgust, I felt relieved because she I would stop fucking around, but it didn't end there, we had theater practices where we were doing a play that would be presented at the end of the year, and in that play I was Sasha's father, the same one who flirted with me, and she used that opportunity to stick to me a lot, she wore a dress that highlighted her curves etc etc, although I wasn't interested, so in those practices from time to time people from other groups and grades came to see what was up, and sometimes my ex, she would stare at me with suspicion and hatred when I was with Sasha, although if it were up to me I would only be with Ruby, but like that 4 months passed, and she tried to make me jealous, and on one occasion she was hugging Jonathan in front of me, but here's the plot twist because Ruby was having a heat stroke and as a good man and friend I picked her up and took her to the bathrooms behind the stage, and she stared at me with a hatred that made me smile, luckily Ruby was fine, it was very mild, and when I told her we were laughing out loud, her last attempt The first thing that made me jealous was on Insta when she uploaded photos of her and Jonathan, but she doesn't know that I have blocked her and him everywhere, and until now nothing has happened, but I don't think this is the end of this, I appreciate the people who liked this, but tell me, was it wrong of me to cut her off?

Maybe it‚Äôs habit. Maybe it‚Äôs survival.**

But behind that smile? Numbness. Exhaustion. The kind of quiet panic that makes brushing your teeth feel like climbing a damn mountain.

And no one sees it. Not your coworkers. Not your friends. Sometimes not even your partner.

I lived in that space for a long time. Anxiety turned everything into noise. My mind was a browser with 47 tabs open, one of them blasting music I couldn‚Äôt find. And depression? It didn‚Äôt look like crying. It looked like scrolling. Disappearing into TikTok at 2AM because silence was worse.

But Therapy? No, That Was ‚ÄúFor People Who Can Afford It‚Äù I used to think therapy was a luxury. Like skincare fridges or meal kits or having time to journal in a sunlit apartment with plants you didn‚Äôt kill. I had this image of a white couch, a $150 bill, and some woman nodding while I awkward-laughed my trauma into a pillow.

**Plus‚Ä¶ where do you even start? Do you Google ‚Äúfix me‚Äù?**

Turns out, you don‚Äôt. You just [click a link.](https://onlinetherapy.go2cloud.org/SHXK)

One night, after a week of crying in the bathroom at work and ghosting everyone, I stumbled onto a post about online therapy. I don‚Äôt even remember what it said exactly. Something like, ‚ÄúIf you can swing it, online therapy is a thing and it‚Äôs actually pretty good.‚Äù

No big promises. No fake cheer. Just... honest. That mattered.

So I clicked. It took me to [OnlineTherapy.com](https://onlinetherapy.go2cloud.org/SHXK) . Didn‚Äôt feel like a big decision. Felt more like, ‚Äú*What the hell, this can‚Äôt be worse than whatever this is.‚Äù*

**Therapy in Pajamas?**

Yes, Please Let me tell you, there‚Äôs something oddly comforting about crying in your own room while talking to a therapist over video. No awkward waiting rooms. No bus rides where you replay everything you just said. Just you, a real human on the other side of the screen, and space to finally breathe.

The first session? Weird. I won‚Äôt lie. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù at least three times. But the therapist didn‚Äôt let it slide. She didn‚Äôt push either. She just... held space. And when I finally said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I feel like this all the time,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to. Not yet.‚Äù

**That cracked something open.**

Is It Magic? Nope. But It‚Äôs Movement Online therapy didn‚Äôt fix me. But it gave me tools. Words. Even silly metaphors that helped things click, like, ‚ÄúYour mind‚Äôs on fire. Therapy‚Äôs not water. It‚Äôs learning where the extinguisher is.‚Äù

It gave me a rhythm. A reason to reflect. Someone who didn‚Äôt know my family or my job or my entire messy history, who still cared anyway.

And weirdly? That made it easier to be honest. To stop curating my pain like it needed to be palatable.

**‚ÄúBut What If I Can‚Äôt Talk About It?‚Äù**

Hey, I get it. I used to freeze at the question, ‚ÄúHow are you, really?‚Äù Like... how much are we allowed to say without scaring people off?

Here‚Äôs the thing. Therapy is the one place where you don‚Äôt have to package your feelings with a bow on top. You can show up a mess. You can be angry, numb, confused, embarrassed, exhausted. You can even say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk today,‚Äù and that‚Äôs okay.

Especially with platforms like [OnlineTherapy.com](https://onlinetherapy.go2cloud.org/SHXK), where therapists specialize in anxiety, trauma, self-worth, all the stuff you‚Äôve been told is ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù They get it.

**And you don‚Äôt have to explain everything in perfect words. You just have to start.**

Real Talk: Is It Worth the Money? Listen, I‚Äôd rather spend less than my monthly coffee habit on something that helps me sleep at night. That keeps me from snapping at the people I love. That makes me feel... not broken.

You might be thinking, ‚ÄúWhat if it doesn‚Äôt help?‚Äù Fair. But what if it does?

* *What if one message thread with a therapist helps you catch that spiral before it crashes?*
* *What if you could finally stop holding your breath?*
* *What if this little online corner could be the place where you get to show up fully, without apology?*

Don‚Äôt Wait for Rock Bottom If you‚Äôre still reading this, you probably feel it too, that quiet whisper saying, ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off.‚Äù

You don‚Äôt have to wait for a meltdown. You don‚Äôt have to earn help by hitting some dramatic low. Wanting support is enough. Being tired is enough. You are enough.

[**So here‚Äôs the link I wish someone shoved in my face sooner.**](https://onlinetherapy.go2cloud.org/SHXK)

Maybe just check it out. No pressure. Just curiosity.

Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be your whole story.

It Wasn‚Äôt for Lobster.,"When my grandfather passed, I inherited his boat and his lobster license ‚Äî one of the few remaining full-timers in the region. Those things are gold around here. They get passed down, bought up by big firms, or fought over in court.

I wasn‚Äôt planning on using it. I hadn‚Äôt fished since I was a teenager. But the city wore me down, and grief has a funny way of pulling you back to the places that shaped you. So I came back.

The boat was in decent shape. The traps needed work. I figured I‚Äôd give it a go for a season.

Then, while sorting through his documents, I found it ‚Äî another license. Tucked behind the official one in a crumbling envelope.

Across the top: ‚ÄúSpecial Authority ‚Äì Class M‚Äù

It looked ridiculous. Weathered parchment instead of modern laminate. A symbol like a spiral carved into a skull. Scribbled beneath it in my grandfather‚Äôs hand:

‚ÄúActive. Feed it. Or fight it.‚Äù

I thought it was a joke. Until I showed it to Davey.

Davey‚Äôs an old-timer. Been fishing since before GPS. Three fingers missing on one hand. Drinks rum with his coffee and swears the sea is watching us.

When he saw the Class M license, the color drained from his face.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you get this?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy grandfather‚Äôs drawer.‚Äù

He sat down, didn‚Äôt say a word for a while. Then he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not for lobster. That‚Äôs for them.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt laugh. Not once. Just told me the license wasn‚Äôt a joke. Said it was issued during the war ‚Äî to certain fishermen tasked with keeping the waters clean of things that ‚Äúweren‚Äôt natural.‚Äù

Things that didn‚Äôt belong in the ocean, or anywhere.

He called it ‚Äúthe monster license.‚Äù

Said once you hold it, it‚Äôs your job to keep watch. And if you ever see anything strange in the Blue Ridge Deep, you don‚Äôt call for help. You take care of it yourself.

Because if you don‚Äôt, nobody will.

He lifted up his fingerless hand. ""I came back. My brother wasn't so lucky.""

I didn‚Äôt believe him, obviously. But I still found myself heading to Blue Ridge the next night. I told myself I was just checking traps, but I didn‚Äôt drop any. I had the Class M license in my pocket.

The sea was silent. Not calm ‚Äî silent. No gulls. No insects. Just the slow suck of the tide.

Then my sonar pinged.

I hadn‚Äôt seen it in years, but I knew the shape of a school, the arc of a big fish. This‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt that.

It was a massive return. Stationary. Rising.

The boat shifted, gently at first. Then harder, rocking side to side. Water sloshed over the rails.

That‚Äôs when I heard it ‚Äî a low groan beneath the waves. Like steel twisting. Like something waking up.

A claw ‚Äî the size of a man ‚Äî slammed onto the side of the boat and tore through the railing. I fell, smashed my head against the throttle.

I barely had time to crawl when it surged onto the deck.

It had a long, segmented body like an insect, but with the wet, shining skin of a deep sea creature. Limbs that ended in crablike cutters. Its head was wrong ‚Äî too many eyes, all locked on me.

It lunged.

I grabbed a gaff hook and drove it into the thing‚Äôs side. It shrieked and knocked me across the deck. I landed hard on the wheelhouse steps, felt something crack in my side.

My leg was bleeding. My ribs were broken. The monster climbed toward me, slow and deliberate, like it knew it had already won.

I reached for anything ‚Äî a tool, a knife, a rope. My fingers closed on plastic.

The flare gun.

I didn‚Äôt think. I aimed for the center of its chest and pulled the trigger.

The flare exploded into its body with a wet, hissing pop. It let out this awful gurgling scream, thrashed violently, and threw itself overboard, the deck splitting behind it.

I lay there for a long time. Bleeding. Shaking. Alone.

I limped the boat back to shore as the sun rose.

At the dock, I climbed off and collapsed. Someone called an ambulance. I told them it was a motor accident. They didn‚Äôt ask too many questions.

I spent the night in the hospital. Got stitched up. Cracked ribs, gash in my thigh, mild concussion.

They released me the next morning.

I went straight to the boatyard. My plan was to strip everything, sell the license, burn the papers. 

Leave.

But when I stepped on the deck, I saw the drawer open. The Class M license sat there, speckled with dried blood.

I thought of my grandfather. Of how he‚Äôd kept fishing, year after year. Of what might‚Äôve happened to this town if he hadn‚Äôt.

That monster wasn‚Äôt the only one.

There are others. Maybe worse.

I looked out at the horizon. Fog rolling in.

Then I locked the drawer, picked up my machete, restocked the flare gun, and fueled up the boat.

If no one else is going to protect these waters‚Ä¶ I guess it‚Äôs up to me.",23,1754295784.0,nosleep,0,0.97,False

1mh7sz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CocoYumi86/comments/1mh7sz2/the_grandpas_garden/,The Grandpa's Garden,"There‚Äôs a man in my neighborhood, probably in his 80s, who tends to a small but beautiful garden every day. It‚Äôs not big‚Äîjust a few rows of flowers, some herbs, and a tomato plant that‚Äôs growing out of a recycled coffee can‚Äîbut it‚Äôs his. Every morning, like clockwork, he walks out with his little radio and a thermos of tea, and gets to work. I asked him once why he puts so much effort into a garden most people pass by. He smiled and said, ‚ÄúBecause it gives me something to love.‚Äù

That really stuck with me. Something to love. Maybe it‚Äôs a garden. A dog. A song you play on repeat. A group chat with old friends. A book that feels like home. Whatever it is, hold on to it. Tend to it. Let it ground you, the way that garden grounds him.

Wholesome moments aren‚Äôt always loud. Sometimes they‚Äôre quiet and consistent‚Äîlike watering plants before the sun gets too hot. Or waving at a neighbor who always waves back. We‚Äôre all just trying to grow something beautiful, in our own little way.",10,1754295763.0,u_CocoYumi86,0,0.92,False

1mh7rby,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1mh7rby/the_joys_of_remote_work_6_surprising_benefits/,The Joys of Remote Work: 6 Surprising Benefits,"I've been working remotely for a while now, and I can honestly say it's been a game-changer. Not only do I get to avoid the daily commute, but I've also discovered a sense of freedom and flexibility that I never thought possible. Here are six real benefits of remote work that I think are worth sharing ‚Äì and one bonus that might just surprise you.  


**1. My Day, My Rules**

One of the best things about remote work is being able to create my own schedule. I'm not a morning person, so I don't have to pretend to be one just to fit in with the office crowd. I can work at 10 am, 2 pm, or 5 am ‚Äì whenever I feel most productive. And with no commute to worry about, I can take breaks whenever I need to.

**2. Time and Sanity Restored**

Let's face it: commuting can be a real drag. Traffic, crowded trains, and long hours spent sitting can take a toll on our mental and physical health. By working from home, I've saved hours of my day that I can now use for more enjoyable activities ‚Äì like taking a walk, practicing yoga, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee in peace.

**3. Home Sweet Office**

My workspace is my happy place. I can wear whatever I want, cook my favorite meals, and even have my furry friends by my side. It's amazing how much of a difference a comfortable workspace can make in terms of focus and productivity. Plus, I no longer have to deal with awkward office chair ergonomics or awkward small talk with coworkers.

**4. Autonomy and Creativity**

When I'm working remotely, I feel like I have more ownership over my projects. I can take the time I need to research, brainstorm, and experiment without being micromanaged. This freedom has allowed me to develop my skills, try new things, and even come up with innovative solutions to problems.

**5. A World of Opportunities**

Remote work has opened doors to new possibilities for me. I can work with clients and companies from all over the world, which has broadened my perspectives and introduced me to fascinating people and projects. Plus, with the rise of remote work, I've noticed that many companies are now more open to hiring people from diverse backgrounds and locations.

**6. Work-Life Balance, Redefined**

When I'm working from home, I can seamlessly integrate my work and personal life. I can take care of errands, attend to family obligations, or simply enjoy a quiet cup of coffee in the morning without feeling guilty. It's amazing how much more productive and fulfilled I feel when I can take control of my [work-life balance](https://wiredtoremote.com/how-do-you-maintain-work-life-balance-while-working-remotely).

*And A Bonus Point?*

**You'll Discover Who You Are Outside of Work**

When I'm not stuck in traffic or dealing with office politics, I have the space to explore my passions and interests. I've started painting again, reading more, and even learning a new language. Remote work has given me the freedom to be me ‚Äì outside of work, at least. It's been a journey of self-discovery, and I'm grateful for it.",1,1754295590.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

until never trusting a fart became farting endlessly with a truck load of shite trapped in my
colon

i‚Äôm telling you, i feel and look 7 months pregnant

i came home from stabling my pony last night and ate my weight in malted wheat, topped with 2 bananas. i was certain that this was going to get things moving since it‚Äôd been around 48 hours since i last abused imodium (a heart to heart with my friend concluded with, ‚Äúonce you sh!t in that porta loo once, you‚Äôll never be scared again‚Äù i had to reverse the poop chain and fast)

this didn‚Äôt work

knowing grapes are a trigger, i ate several of them from the fridge like a hungry rat at 4am

so here i am, reaching out to strangers on reddit clutching a hot coffee and hoping it‚Äôs the one that gets things moving
