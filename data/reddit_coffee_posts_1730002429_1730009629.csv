(They have changed some things up, but not really.)

Once you arrive at the DELTA campus you'll be directed from the security officers booth to a small lobby and retrieve your name badge and given directions to the building where the day will begin.

You'll wait in the lobby until your host arrives to great you and give you information on the day and try to sell why DELTA is this magnificent company to work for. (Subjective \*\*GOOGLE IT\*\*)

Here you'll see a number of candidates from around the nation just like you.

\- Produce 2 forms of I.D

\- Receive a ZONE (1,2, or 3) - (don't get nervous on placement, this is for organization)

You'll be escorted upstairs where you can leave your luggage and you'll be told to leave everything in that room, (phones, resumes, workbooks, etc.)

Once upstairs you'll be greeted by 20+ current flight attendants clapping and cheering you on (AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THE POSITION) (You DIDN'T so do not be fooled by this marketing tactic)

Once your belongings and secured you'll be seated by your zones and they will begin telling you about the day.

This is where the fun begins :-)

**Zone 1 will go and complete the 1 on 1 interview first. (You will sit with a current FA and a talent req representative and go over basic STAR questions.)**

**\*\*\* NOOBS: S-Situation | T-Task | A-Action| R-Result (What happened, what was the task, what action did you take and what was the result... Make sure you actions provided a positive result)\*\*\***

They'll talk about themselves for a sec then a little about you....

I do not remember all of the questions but TWO of them for sure is:

1. Tell be about a time you had to work with a co worker with a difficult personality
2. Let's say LAX is where you are assigned. What would that look like for you?

THEY WILL ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS.

NEXT THEY WILL DO A ROLL PLAY WITH YOU AND THE FA WHERE YOU ARE THE ""PRETEND FA"" AND THEY ARE THE PASSENGER AND THERE IS NO OVERHEAD-BIN SPACE AND YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE THEM AND LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE TO CHECK THERE BAG.

**ZONE 2 will be conducting the ""REACH TEST""**

You'll be asked to remove your shoes (Wear clean socks) and reach with both hands to see if you are able to close the overhead bins. (If you are vertically challenged don't be discouraged, have you ever seen a 6'8 FA? Yeah me neither) Then you'll be asked to sit in a jump-seat and put the seatbelts and place your hands on your knees while you sit.

BUT DON'T BE FOOLED MY GOOD FRIENDS this ""test"" is to see you have visible tattoos on your hands fingers, wrists, etc... while you perform those tasks. this ""test"" is no more then 1 minute long

If you have any TATS...PLEASE PUT ON MAKE UP Or something to cover them. no matter where they are!!!! \*\*Even though yes I have photos of current DELTA FA's with hand, finger, neck, behind ear tats...\*\* contradiction much

**ZONE 3 will be conducting the team exercise (This is where they changed somethings up, ill explain towards the end in case they try to switch it up AGAIN :-) )**

Here you'll team up with 2 other candidates where you have to decide between say 20 issues from most important to least important and place them on a board 1-10

You'll have a ""mingle"" session where they'll tell you to walk around meet and greet blah blah. (they are killing time)

(They are deliberating on who they are keeping and who they are sending home)

Last you'll all be sitting down where they begin to tell you more about the position AS IF YOU ALL GOT THE JOB! Please do not fall for that. They will go over several hot topics like where you'll be based scheduling and pay which is the following:

1. During training in ATL is $7/HR \*\*lol i know\*\* (you will have a room-ate at a hotel during training and be provided meals throughout your training) upon graduation it will start at $35/hr.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*35/HR FLIGHT TIME is when you are paid\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

ie: during boarding you're paid $2 until you depart and take off, that is when your $35/HR Begins.

IE: You have 4 legs (flights) today. Once you get to the airport for your sign in time for say 5am for a 6am departure you are not getting paid your $35/HR until you take off and when you land and get to the gate. At that time your back to your 2 dollars. So while you're helping passengers board, helping with bags, assisting with needs both pre departure and arrival its 2 bucks....(if you have a 2-3 hour sit time at the next city until your next flight you're being paid your $2 dollars. Rinse and repeat

ALL DAY LONG YOU'LL HERE DELTA MONITORS EVERYTHING DO NOT SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ALL THAT WENT ON

THEY WILL CALL YOUR NAMES ONE BY ONE ACCORDING TO THE ZONES 1,2, AND 3

If you are called you DID NOT GET THE POSITION!!!

You'll grab your things and are escorted out the building to the airport or wherever you came from

when they say PLEASE LOOK OUT FOR YOUR EMAILS do not fall for that you DID NOT get the position

(they will say this several times)

Once all of us common folks are escorted out those that remained after all the zones were called, are the ones that are given the CJO- Drug test and background!!!!!! (When you are being walked out the will try and shade and cover who is left with there bodies...\* for conflict prevention reasons (HOW THIS MF make it etccc)\*

I will say this class had so much great talent and they passed on them all. ALL EXCEPT 3/30 of us. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE AIRLINES EXPERIENCE NOR DO YOU HAVE TO BE SOME PERFECT ROBOT during this event. Those are people eyeballing you as if you're some fish in the barrel do not be intimidated, be your self and give it your best shot. IT IS A POPULARITY CONTEST- It has very little to do with where you are currently, (My class had 10+ current FA's, only one who I adored got through).

I've done this FOUR TIMES, Think about it Ive had to apply, virtual interview and make it to ATL 4 times. How is it that not once that I have received any offer. (Some will say ""yeahh i got it on my 10th try""- BRUH WHAT)

LASTLY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU ARE NOT SELECTED. DELTA IS ONE FISH IN THE OCEAN. AMERICAN/UNITED/SOUTHWEST are also great companies to join as an FA with WAYYYYYYY better flight benefits\*\*\* GOOGLE IT\*\* (Which is why we obviously initially apply).... Anywho I am current in the business and have plenty of info if needed....let me know.

Good luck peeps....

Team exercise CART

If they decide to do the CART test you will team up the same 3-4 candidates and have to ""build the cart"" with the provided info given on a sheet.

ie: You have a morning flight, place the items on the cart according to info on sheet (Im paraphrasing)

1gd41x2,https://i.redd.it/g1n3lf0pj8xd1.jpeg,First setup and a new rabbit hole to explore.,"Been wanting an espresso machine for a while after some toying around with one at my work office and a brief housemate having one. Found the oscar 2 in great condition used, and had wanted the grinder as a ""quiet"" grinder for general use (do it all/decent price). After getting the machine and grinder, I found this sub, and boy oh boy I have learnt that there is a lot to learn in this hobby. 

I love strong milk drinks (machiato/cortado, quad capps for the larger volume, iced coffee etc) and wanted to be able to make them myself. The Aeropress wasn't cutting it anymore over just a drip coffee machine for convenience and volume. So making espresso based drinks at home was the next step. Still haven't acquired the palate for straight espresso, but I also used to say that about whiskey and wine and enjoyed the learning experience there. Already after reading through this sub I've decided on a few key accessories to be able to maintain consistency while learning, and try hone in on a shot that I enjoy.

The sub has also already made me wish I'd made some different choices on the grinder/machine, but it's still probably far more than I needed at this point regardless, and had some features that I chose each for over others in my budget. All in all, it will be fun learning and making this setup work to my maximum potential, and can always be excited to upgrade later on should I outgrow it.  ",5,1730007228.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

We both went to different cities for work around January. I surprised her by visiting her in April.

Everything was going perfect then around June, she started talking less to me and even started avoiding me, eventually I asked her what's wrong and she told me that she knew that things will have to end between us one day because her parents will never accept a Hindu guy. I asked her why she is already giving up and she told me that she always knew but hid this from me because she loved me. I was angry. I felt like my world has shattered.

I regularly went to the gym to look good, I studied hard and even started working part-time and investing to earn some money for our future. We both loved each other and even lost our virginity to each other in 3rd year. We shared everything with each other, there were no secrets between us. We both respected each other's faith and I told her I will never ask her to change her faith or change her diet for me because I like everything about her. In our college placements, we both got placed. I cracked a 20+ LPA SDE job and she unfortunately got less than she deserved around 4.5 LPA but even if she didn't get a job I would have taken care of everything. We both went to different cities for work around January. I surprised her by visiting her in April.

Everything was going perfect then around June, she started talking less to me and even started avoiding me, eventually I asked her what's wrong and she told me that she knew that things will have to end between us one day because her parents will never accept a Hindu guy. I asked her why she is already giving up and she told me that she always knew but hid this from me because she loved me. I was angry. I felt like my world has shattered. I asked her to take her time and think about this and not rush her decision. She started responding hours after my texts and sometimes not replying at all. 2 weeks back I had asked her how she is feeling and she told me ""Bhai, you should move on to somebody who would actually be good for you and stop texting me."" BC itna ganda kata h na mera. I just feel like a part of me has died and I don't know if I will ever be able to love someone like I loved her.",1,1730006999.0,u_Iworkhard7,0,1.0,False

A few of my observations:
1. Prior to the flight I found that calling the airline for help was not a fun experience.
2. Boarding- The flight had the largest number of pre-boards I have ever seen on any other airline or destination.  Not sure why?
3. Business class seats were not roomy like I had hoped for.  My wife‚Äôs seat was broken and they had to move her to,another seat‚Ä¶. Not happy about that.
4. They keep the cabin way too warm.  And the cubbyhole that your legs go in to was hot.  We did not sleep well.  Next flight I will wear shorts and have a usb fan.
5.  Food was the best!
6.  Service was prompt and professional but sort of soul-less and humorless‚Ä¶. it was weird.  My wife asked for decaf coffee and the staff acted ‚Äòput-off‚Äô by the request.  would usually help move things on my tray to make it easier for the flight attendant to put other things on it. She would then move the stuff to the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô position.  just odd to me
7.  The lounge was very crowed but we found seats.  lots of good food.  Staff impersonal again?  Wonder if that is a cultural thing?

Title says it all: I am very new to pulling my own espresso shots, so I am wondering if someone can give me some advice.

I got freshly roasted specialty beans from a local roaster (roasted 6 days ago), I ground them using a hand crank mill with a ceramic burr (see pic below of the grind size).

https://preview.redd.it/5aij0uyuh8xd1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d85c97802b9d8075e4286bd6ff7c7fcaaccaf7a

I first ran a cycle with just water to heat up the filter and my mug. Then, I filled the double shot basket with a dose of 13.5g of the freshly ground beans, tamped with what I think was the right amount of pressure (not too hard, just enough to get it level). Then, using the default pressurized portafilter that the Dedica comes with, I pressed the double shot button.

I got a yield of barely 10 g, maybe 12 or 13 if I allowed it to drop a bit more, with a thin layer of crema.

Before I upgrade to a bottomless portafilter, I'm trying to understand what I'm doing wrong. I was thinking maybe I'm grinding it all wrong, so I tried with grocery store bought espresso ground coffee, and even then, it works only occasionally. Half of the time, I get only a few drops of yield.

So am I making an error with the dose or am I tamping it wrong? Or is the machine faulty? I even tried manually overriding the time, by holding down the button till I get 30 g of yield, but it doesn't work great. I hold it down, a few drops, and it stops. I hold it down again, another few drops and it stops. The eventual coffee has some body and flavour, but almost 0 crema.

Looking for (hopefully) long-term hanging out buddy/buddies!,"Hello, hi! I'm Meatball. Or Ron, or whatever my name might be for the month! My OG nick is really embarassing and i will probably never tell you. But, on to the actual post! I'm a kinda weird person who lives in sweden (in a tiny apartment) that is full of a bunch of records, computers, and coffee mugs all over. I'm into a lot of nerdy stuff,  and i'm very much a homebody so i would appreciate more folks i can hang out with online, since all my IRL friends are old and married and have a bunch of kids and almost zero percent of free time outside of family.

*What would we be doing if we hang out?*

Well, we would watch a ton of movies, that's for sure. I love movies, and i'm very much into horror so i hope you are to? The shittier the better! I love shitty b-horror from the 70s up to the early 2000s, everything later got way to much CGI for my taste, i want those practical effects baby! And if you're up for it we could hang out together with atleast one other person that i know, so it would be awesome if you're up for atleast a three person hang out sometimes!

*What about games?*

Glad you asked! Right now i'm playing a bunch of wow! and would love having more people i can play with, since i hate doing pugs and the people i play most with are very busy with family, etc. So we could def run some mythics, even if we have to pug some, it's way better then doing full pug runs! Other games i frequently play is 

*  Apex Legends
*  Fortnite
*  Project Zomboid (not in a while though)
*  Stardew Valley (have never played co-op and would love to)
*  Minecraft (modded or vanilla, i like both)

i have a bunch of more games, and we can use parsec and emulate pretty much anything so we even can play old co-op games! i also wouldn't mind just hanging out watching  you play something, or you watching me play something. It's way more fun to play a singleplayer game with company i think.

  
*Is that it?*

I think so! Like every other human i'm into a TON of stuff, so listing and mentioning everything would take a whole day. (like music, tv-shows, staring into the wall etc) and yeah, you're timezone doesn't matter a bit to me! I have a ton of time, and my sleep scheduele is erratic to say the least!

  
*is that actual everything?*

I actually think i'm done? If you read all this i'm impressed. And i hope you did! I like people who put as much effort into things as i do, so if you send me a chat request please put some effort into it :) and no racists, bigots, etc. ok? so yeah, hope to hear from you in chat! take care :)",1,1730006641.0,GamerPals,0,1.0,False

For the past few months, he has been showing signs of depression. I know he has experienced this before because he told me. I myself struggle with depression and anxiety, I‚Äôm on meds and have been in therapy for 5 years at this point. The signs are typical depression symptoms: loss of interest in usual activities, excessive sleeping, loss of appetite. Recently, however, it seems to be getting worse. He shuts down whenever I bring this up, to the point of gaslighting me at times and saying he is okay. He continually says no to seeing a therapist of any kind. He stopped working out months ago. I walked to his apartment today and the entire place was full of dirty dishes piled up on the coffee table, floor, trash full to the brim and some in plates. He doesn‚Äôt want me cleaning but also won‚Äôt do anything himself. Tonight it reached a whole new level and he started acting almost catatonic? I‚Äôm no mental health expert but i don‚Äôt know how else to explain staring blankly at a fixed place with no response, only grunting at times to questions, not moving at all. His eyes scared me when I looked into them as if they were not feeling anything when looking at my face? Like there is no sign of recognition? 

I want to support him. We are both immigrants here and don‚Äôt have a support system besides each other. But I don‚Äôt know what to do. This is also triggering my depression/anxiety and it just feels like I‚Äôm stuck in some hole in the ground that I‚Äôve dug for myself. I just need help.

1gd3q23,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gd3q23/i_cant_leave_my_relationship/,I can‚Äôt leave my relationship ,"I (f37) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (m43) for 8 years now. I am not looking for anyone to defend me or to help me justify anything. I have done wrong and I know that. He was married when we met. We met at the gym and it was like some crazy romance movie. The kind where two people meet and the world seems to stop. The instant chemistry and connection on so many levels. It sounds insane but that‚Äôs how it was. I distinctly remember the second time I saw him. He was telling me about a song on his workout playlist and i remember noticing that his eyes were the most beautiful shade of brown. Like the perfect cup of coffee in the morning. He told me about how his marriage wasn‚Äôt working and how he was trying to figure out how leave. But it was hard because his wife handled their finances and he was afraid of losing everything that he had worked for so he was trying to be careful. It just evolved from there. 
Again, I am not looking for retribution. I was wrong. He is not the only one to blame in this. It takes 2 to make these kinds of decisions. I was so convinced that it was ok and it would work out in the end. He made me feel so seen. He made me feel so beautiful and wanted and loved. I loved how he loved me so gently. He‚Äôs been with me through some really hard times in my life and I just knew that if we stuck it out then it would all be worth it in the end. 
He finally got his own place 2 years ago. We still aren‚Äôt a public couple though. Towards the end of things his wife suspected there was something going on and he worked really hard to keep me out of it. I felt terrible and that should have told me enough to walk away but I was so naive‚Ä¶ I just wanted to believe that what we had was worth it. Things have been rocky though. We fight over things that seem so small to me but so big to him. If I don‚Äôt tell him when I get home he wonders why. If I leave out a detail in a story he asks if I left it out on purpose. Trust issues rage with both of us. Both from past experiences. I think that we both have that saying stuck in our minds ‚Äúif they will cheat with you then they will cheat on you‚Äù. But when things are good they are so so good‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so comfortable and so easy. He looks at me with so much love and kisses my forehead and I think that I could die with that feeling and be content forever. We have months where we won‚Äôt fight and it all just works. And then something will happen to blow it up. I always feel like it‚Äôs my fault. Like I need to do more or be more to make him happy. I know that he loves me and he knows that I love him. There are things that we need to work through, I know. Therapy could help but he won‚Äôt go. I have gone and I have learned a lot about how to cope with my feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. Those things make me see all of the red flags flying around me. But I just shove them in a closet and keep going in my bliss. 
I know that I should leave. I know that we aren‚Äôt stable. I know that we shouldn‚Äôt be together and there are so many things that we both need to work on. But then we will fight and just when I think it‚Äôs going to end we will both cave. We both knock down our walls to reach out and meet in the middle and we agree to keep going. I try and I see him try too. It‚Äôs not perfect. It didn‚Äôt start right. We didn‚Äôt do the right thing to begin with. Again, I‚Äôm not looking for anyone to defend my actions there. The thing I need to get off my chest is that I don‚Äôt think that I can really leave. I don‚Äôt think I can fully walk away. I will always love him and there will always be a line that can pull me back no matter what. All the red flags just get shoved into the closet and I keep going. And I really don‚Äôt think that I will ever be able to leave. 
I wish I could say that I were stronger. Honestly I‚Äôm just a fool in love with a fool and we both just keep going. Maybe we will get some hallmark ending. Maybe we will crash and burn and I will have to pick up all of the pieces. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm sure I will find out one day. But for today, I am still here. Still in love. Still going back because I can‚Äôt walk away. 
For anyone who made it this far, thank you. Have a wonderful night and I wish you all the best and happiness in the world. All my love to you and yours.

Random thoughts:
--absolutely like the new maxcimal formula better than the old one. And Warm Teddy is so much better on warm tone skin than Velvet teddy and Spirit, both serviceable nudes but they tend to make teeth look yellow and give washed out appearance in the wrong light. Warm teddy has none of those issues, it's so flattering and I hope more pinays try it lol

--creme in your coffee is one of the closest lippies I've ever found to my actual lip color. A true mlbb.

--mocha is a nice terracotta on me, but virtually all brands have shades just like this. Like a lot of sunnies and colourette colors swatch up the same

--Mull It Over is my only powder kiss lipstick from MAC. Love love love the texture when I feel like wearing a lightweight matte. It also has a lovely brightening effect on my overall look, as a coral pink that's not overpowering or too cool/fake

--Marrakesh (along with Mull It Over and Warm Teddy) is among my top 3 favorite MAC lippies. It has an amazing opaque creaminess that wears so well and fades away evenly. I'm not big on reds, tend to give most of them away, but this one I love. My favorite intense warm red.

--Coffee and Cigs is your classic 90s browney mauve lip. This is from their Love Me line and it has apparently been discontinued w/c is a bit disappointing because this was a versatile formula I liked. You can apply it lightly for a kind of translucent ""black honey"" effect or really layer it on for a more dramatic vampy vibe.

Ben Cohen | The Wall Street Journal

It‚Äôs a philosophy of just four words that describe Apple‚Äôs past, present and definitely its future. Four words that help explain why this was the year the company plowed into spatial computing and artificial intelligence. During one of those epochal years when it feels like everything is about to change again, I heard them over and over, in conversation with Apple executives and Cook himself: Not first, but best.

Paul Kix | Esquire

Colin opened his eyes and saw the flash of a tiger shark, twice as long as he was, biting down on his left leg. He punched the shark on its nose. Once, twice, again and again and again. Its skin felt like sandpaper against his fist. The shark thrashed from the blows, butted Colin, then pulled away. Colin rose to the surface. Panicked, panting, he grabbed his surfboard to try to paddle to shore. He looked behind him to trace the shark but saw something else.

Mescal, 28, has, in just four short years, established himself as one of the finest actors of his generation. In my estimation, he‚Äôs the most naturalistic. He possesses a very rare and specific brand of masculinity, both solid‚Äîthanks, in part, to years playing Gaelic football‚Äîand vulnerable. He cries beautifully.

Over the course of this election cycle, a group of these men have coalesced around a new mission: putting Donald Trump back in the White House. They are the Republican Party‚Äôs ascendant donor class, and they operate on a plane very different from that of the donors who preceded them. They have not only a seemingly limitless amount of money to help make this particular vision a reality but also their own media profiles and platforms to use toward that end.

Merve Emre | The Paris Review

To say ‚Äúreinvigorate it‚Äù might not be fair, because when was the novel not vigorous?

This is the space where you relax, entertain, and showcase your personal taste. Choosing the right pieces can enhance your room's aesthetic, while carefully selected [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) can bring warmth and functionality to your [home decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/). Here's your ultimate guide to picking the perfect pieces to make your living room a cozy, stylish retreat!

**1. Start with a Comfortable Sofa**

The sofa is the focal point of your living room. To find the right one, look for materials that balance comfort and durability, such as microfiber or a quality leather. Choose a color and design that reflects your style‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs minimalist, rustic, or modern chic. If space allows, an L-shaped sofa can maximize seating and create a relaxed vibe.

Pro tip: Opt for a neutral color sofa for versatility, then add accent pillows for pops of color that can be changed with the seasons.

**2. Add Layered Lighting with Pendant Lights**

Lighting can make or break the ambiance of your living room. Incorporate a mix of lighting options, including stylish [pendant lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), floor lamps, and table lamps, to layer light and create a cozy atmosphere. Pendant lights not only add brightness but can serve as statement pieces in your living room, adding height and elegance to the decor.

For a modern touch, try hanging a pendant light with a unique design over the coffee table. Consider materials like glass or metal finishes to match your other furnishings.

**3. Pick Versatile Side Tables and Coffee Tables**

Coffee tables and side tables are essential for both functionality and style. Choose a coffee table that complements your sofa, ideally one that is within two inches of your sofa‚Äôs seat height for ease. Materials like wood bring warmth, while glass or metal add a contemporary feel.

Side tables are perfect for holding drinks, remote controls, or small decor items. Look for versatile designs with built-in storage to keep things organized and maintain a clutter-free space.

**4. Add a Statement Armchair or Accent Chair**

An accent chair or armchair can add character to your living room. Look for designs with plush cushions and sturdy arms that provide comfort, especially if you love to curl up with a good book. Choose a color or pattern that stands out to create a focal point in the room.

Whether it‚Äôs a classic wingback chair or a more modern barrel chair, an armchair adds style and additional seating for guests.

**5. Use Rugs to Define the Space**

A well-chosen rug can tie together your living room‚Äôs look. Choose a rug size that allows all your furniture to sit on it, or at least the front legs of the main pieces. For style, opt for patterns or colors that match your decor theme, whether that‚Äôs a bold geometric print or a soft, neutral hue.

Rugs add warmth to the space and make the area feel more inviting. Consider materials that are soft and easy to clean, especially in high-traffic areas.

**6. Incorporate Functional Storage Solutions**

Storage is key in the living room, especially for items you want within reach but out of sight. Look for multifunctional furniture like ottomans with hidden storage or media units with built-in shelves. Not only do they offer functionality, but they also contribute to a tidy, organized space.

Shelving units can also provide storage and an opportunity for home decoration. Use them to display decorative objects, books, or plants to add personality to your living room.

**7. Accent with Decorative Elements**

Finally, bring your living room to life with decorative elements like throws, pillows, and art. Throws add softness and warmth to the sofa, while pillows provide extra comfort and can introduce patterns or colors to the space. Hang artwork or framed photos on the walls to create a gallery feel and inject personal charm into the room.

For an extra touch, incorporate vases, candles, or decorative trays that add layers to the decor.

**Final Thoughts**

The best living rooms are those that offer a balance of style and comfort. With carefully selected home furniture and thoughtful design, you can create a space that is both functional and welcoming. Remember to layer in lighting, such as pendant lights, and choose pieces that reflect your personal style and lifestyle needs. With the right furniture choices and decor, your living room will be a haven of comfort and style.",1,1730005165.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1gd3fhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMOver30/comments/1gd3fhq/not_being_stealth_sucks/,Not being stealth sucks,"Sorry to bring negativity into the sub tonight, but I'm really burned out.

I'm 7 months on T and I do pass to strangers. But I've been transitioning while working a very social coffee shop job.

Honestly most of our regulars have been respectful towards me, except one old guy who said some mean shit to my face. Not sure why he decided to be nice to me again after that, but thankfully he did.

The really bad part is coworkers. I've had 2 downright transphobic coworkers make me their target since coming out a year ago. Those obviously weren't great experiences and I unfortunately still work with one of them. But arguably worse in my opinion is the people I work with who infantilize me or treat me differently as soon as they know I'm trans. The infantilization is infuriating bc it's a more subtle form of transphobia that you usually have to address yourself, instead of blatant transphobia that you can report to management.

In the past 2 months I've had:
1. A new cis woman coworker get obsessed with me and hit on me in front of other coworkers. She then was shocked to learn that I'm trans and acted weird for a while. Now we're surprisingly cool, but it was still really stressful when she was being awkward and weird.

2. A new genderqueer coworker who's fixated on me and massively trauma dumped, and has majorly overstepped boundaries. They have also infantilized me in a very overt way. This person has repeatedly triggered my dysphoria even after a talk about not commenting on things like my voice, or discussing my transness. There's more to it, but I've already posted about it so not going to talk about it more.

Both of these scenarios have just been exhausting for me bc I have no way of knowing just how transphobic and/or nasty someone might get towards me, if they're obviously fixated on my transness or have some sort of issue with it. I'm constantly on guard and stressed bc we get new people a lot, since our turnover is high.

I will say that the vast majority of my cis coworkers have been more respectful than I expected. The long-term coworkers who've seen me transition since the beginning now never mess up my pronouns.

At any rate. My hope is to either stealth at a new job, or at least get a non-social job with minimal human interaction for my own peace of mind. But I live in a transphobic red state so I'm trying to hold out until I can get my legal information changed. The hope is to be able to stealth at a new job, but if legislation takes away the ability to stealth then I guess I'll deal with that as it comes.

I feel like I've been posting some very negative stuff in this sub lately and I do feel bad about that. But still, it feels reassuring to be able to come here and be understood + taken seriously. So thank you to anyone who reads this stuff and validates the struggles.",9,1730004643.0,FTMOver30,0,1.0,False

I never really talked to her but over time I would notice her looking over at me. Then about three weeks ago she finally got the courage to come over and talk to me.

We kind of chit chat and small talk. Mentions her boyfriend and her future plans. What strikes me as odd though was she talks literally about how she wants to get married, but then proceeds to talk poorly about him physical looks aside.

She asks me if I'm seeing anyone. I said "" I'm looking but I'm not asking anyone out because..."" she cuts me off mid sentence.

Her "" You want effort?""

Me a little surprised "" Yes.. exactly.""

Then guess who suddenly yet slowly starting to put in more effort...

I'm trying to keep her at arms length both literally and metaphorically speaking but it only seems to have the opposite effect.

Then one day about a week ago I guess she got lost in her feelings. I was asking her something and she just gazes deeply into my eyes and down at my mouth. I say to my self internally ""...god damit. Why me.."".

They are some of the nicest people I have ever met. However, I often feel anxious around them as I feel like I don't really appreciate all the favors they do for me. It seems like they are always cooking for me, making me coffee, spending money on me, offering to help me plan for things, and it can just get overwhelming because I didn't ask for any of that and now I feel like they are expecting something in return. I don't know what. A reaction? A smile? And then I feel nervous because I feel like I have to fake an authentic response of gratitude when I really could have just done those things myself. Maybe I would even prefer to do it myself.

Worse, these people fatigue and stress themselves out trying to help me. And then I feel guilty because they are working their asses off for me for something I won't even need or appreciate, and when I tell them ""it's okay you don't need to do that,"" they just think I'm being polite and insist on doing it anyway.

Catherine Somerset, navigating her 30th blind date, seems unfazed and disinterested as she sits across from an unremarkable man. Her lack of enthusiasm is in stark contrast to the man‚Äôs open fascination with her. Meanwhile, Raphael Lindberg‚Äîa handsome, powerful figure with a cold demeanor‚Äîwatches the interaction from his luxurious Maybach, suggesting an unspoken connection and intrigue that hints at deeper layers in both his and Catherine‚Äôs lives.

This was Catherine Somerset‚Äôs 30th blind date, and it took place at Shelton Restaurant. The man, dressed in a suit, wasn‚Äôt particularly striking in appearance. Nevertheless, his eyes were fixed on Catherine‚Äôs beautiful features. He was clearly intrigued by the pretty lady sitting across from him. Meanwhile, Catherine stirred her coffee in silence.

Her impassive expression indicated that the man‚Äôs interest was only one-sided. Unlike him, she wasn‚Äôt the least bit interested. Outside the restaurant, a sleek black Maybach was discreetly parked in a corner. Its windows were wound up, and inside the car sat Raphael Lindberg. He had strikingly handsome features and an icy demeanor.

All those years spent in the business world led to him developing a commanding presence as well. He rolled down the window and calmly observed the interaction between the two people inside the restaurant. Initially, the conversation seemed amicable.

But in the next moment, the man sitting across the young lady appeared to be saying some jeering words, which were then accompanied by a lecherous smile. This caused Catherine‚Äôs expression to falter a little, and she immediately stood to leave.

Alls that to say, what started as a fun game really got me back into music, and I really like it, I do it hours a day and feel like I'm getting to a point where I'd consider myself decent.  Can yall help me hone in on some improvement and listen to my example?  I whipped it up in a half hour or so, with a type beat from this producer here, go give him a shout: (I think links are against the rules, he's JustDan Beats on youtube, he's nice with it).

**THIS WAS RECORDED MIXED AND MASTERED AT MY HOME!  MY ENGINEER HAS GREAT ROOM TREATMENT AND IS MUCH BETTER THAN ME AT WHAT WE BOTH DO!**

[https://soundcloud.com/s-l-y-l-e/intermission](https://soundcloud.com/s-l-y-l-e/intermission)

Rhyme Schemes - I think I've come a long where here, but my engineer yells at me about arrangement and formatting because I don't do hook.  I need to do hooks.  Y'all think my rhymes are ight?  Aesthetic aside, thats a different category which frankly, I have none.  I think one thing I don't like about my schemes is that sometimes I allow rhyme links to sit a bit too long and they fall flat.  Need to work on inter-bar rhyming and call and response timings.

Punching in and Formatting - I admit, I'm just lazy.  I like to just rip.  If people had the attention span for a 30 minute cypher with beat switches etc, I'd just do that.  It's just fun to me and feels good to yell at my microphone.  I'll do it regardless of if I ever see a cent, and people laugh at me sometimes but I can take the piss.  It's what I like to do!  But this is where I dip my toes.  I need to develop a style, aesthetic, direction, and stick to it for cohesion if I want to go to spotify.  This also causes micro-nudging and I end up driving myself crazy trying to push the pocket or deciding whether to warp or re record lol.  We're talking OCD over miliseconds.

Vocal Transposition (Down) - Either my voice is just super white boy and there are frequency qualities about artists like ASAP Rocky's voice that make them sound better when you transpose down, or maybe I need a specific plugin.  Idk.  The warping algorithms in ableton are amazing, but they really can create confusion when it comes to pitching things up and down.  And I DID read the manual - the formants from the ableton warping algorithms are just undesirable to my ear IMO.

Mix - When I pull type beats, they sometimes have a mastering chain already on them - I can tell because of how saturated they sound.  Also, I have a shure sm7b with a cloudlifter Z, but have been considering selling those two pieces of gear or trading them for a good dynamic mic.  I podcast, but not so much where I'd prioritize that via mic selection.  Even with the additional clean gain, I still have to push a LOT of air via EQ into my raw audio signal.  Should I do it?  Anyone else have experience of ableton chains they can share that use this type of a set up?  You can hear the sibilance in my vocals. I need to work on more room treatment so the additional clean gain doesn't pick up the hiss of my computer or the whir of my monitors being very loud.  Started to turn them off during recording.  I've also fallen out of love with plugins like soothe2, or maybe I'm misusing it, in which case my apologies.  It just rips too many frequencies out of your voice and the way it selects them (which can be adjusted) still is a bit odd.  I end up in a see saw battle between my voice, EQ, compression, reverb/delay, reverb, and a limiter.  On my monitors, the mids sound weird but my engineer stresses mids more than highs, and I do it the other way around.  He also prefers dryer vocals, I go wetter with reverb and delay, perhaps to hide behind things I'm not doing correctly.  It never ceases to amaze me how I consistently end up at different end points depending on the beat and the song, even with the same starting vocal preset rack.  lol

Mastering - My mastering chain has a few multiband compressors into a compressor, into a ""negative saturator"" meaning it de-saturates the mix after I compress it.  Frankly, this creates weird overall timbre and I need a new mastering chain.  Judging by the previous section, probably a new vocal one too that's simpler.  It's the XLNT one and you can find it on reddit, but it's geared towards EDM and Dubstep, so my thought is I need to adjust.

If your feedback is thoughtful I'd consider buying your next cup of coffee for your time and consideration or returning the favor.  Thanks!  -slyle/kylito",2,1730003258.0,shareyourmusic,1,1.0,False

# Easy Meal Replacement Shakes for Busy Days

On extremely busy days, you might not have time even for custom recipes. Here are some easy meal replacement shake ideas:

1. Basic Shake: Mix Celebrity Slim Shake powder with water or milk, depending on the shake. For Dairy-Free and Rapid shakes, use milk only, as mixing them with water results in too few calories.  
2. Fruit Boost: Add a handful of frozen fruit to your basic shake.  
3. Veggie Blend: Mix in some spinach or kale for added nutrients.  
4. Nut Butter Swirl: Stir in a teaspoon of your favourite nut butter for an extra protein and fat boost.

A few hours before the date, she asked to change it to dinner at 6.30. Then she asked to move it to 5.00.

The date went well, all things considered. English was her second language and was much better than my Chinese (I don't speak it at all). And no, it never came up in our messages before the date. I did my best to keep the conversation going. She just moved here 6 months ago. She seemed relaxed and safe. I picked up the bill for dinner (it wasn't very expensive and after our conversation I don't think she had a lot of disposable income.  Therefore I was happy to help). After dinner, we did go for a short walk. 
Honestly, I hope we see each other again even if it is just to be friends. I can't even imagine moving to the other side of the planet without any family or friends.",16,1730003040.0,datingoverfifty,7,0.95,False
1gd302k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gd302k,Finally !!! Kintamani beans with G4B ,"Hey All,

I recently bought Kintamani coffee from Bali, intrigued by its reputed citrusy undertones and floral hints. Decided to pair it with my new gear ‚Äì the Hibrew G4B grinder. Wanted to see if this combo would live up to the hype.

Grind: I went for a medium-fine grind. My goal? 
To catch the unique flavours of Kintamani beans.

Brewing Method: Opted for a pour-over - one of the best brewing method for Kintamani beans.

The Verdict: Wow, what a surprise this was!  I mainly picked up on the rich, robust aroma right when I brewed it. Less acidic and very smooth. 

Check the image for how find I did the grind.
