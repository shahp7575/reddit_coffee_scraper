1l8r9nq,https://i.redd.it/s3vodzcmja6f1.jpeg,First use questions [DF83V],"Hi guys, 
my DF83V finally arrived today and I have a few questions to the ones who own one. 

1. Grind in: Useless or obligated? If it’s needed, how much kg should I grind until I’ll pull the first shot? And can I use rice instead of beans?

2. Which grind size do you use for espresso shots? Just to have a parameter to orient at when dialing in.

3. Should I do anything before the first use? Like tightening screws or something?

Thank you all in advance!

And if you've been struggling to balance electrolytes (or feel still like you have high cortisol on carnivore this is for you). 

Currently on a: GAPS-inspired carnivore/keto diet... 

Mostly meat (lamb + beef + liver), broth, eggs, ghee, and butter. I avoid veggies and powders due to past issues with histamine and poorly balanced electrolytes.

I also fast most mornings with just black coffee + butter for focus.

For a while, I’ve been dealing with weird symptoms after meals — things like a hard or fluttery heartbeat, flushing, and general nervous system overstimulation. 

I realized this often happens when fat intake is high, but my electrolyte levels aren’t dialed in. Salt helps, but it’s not always enough on its own.

Recently I started making my own **meat broth** — using a whole chicken, chicken feet, and lamb bones, cooked gently for about 1.5–3 hours to avoid high histamine buildup. 

I add sea salt and apple cider vinegar during cooking.

Drinking a cup of this broth before meals seems to really help balance me out. It’s not instant, but I feel calmer, less reactive, and more grounded afterward. I think the mix of sodium, potassium, glycine, and gelatin is exactly what my system needs — and it’s all food-based, which feels safer for me.

Still dialing things in, but this broth is quickly becoming my core support tool for nervous system stability and electrolyte balance. If anyone else is dealing with similar issues on carnivore or keto

especially with histamine sensitivity or electrolyte crashes...

I highly recommend trying a simple broth like this.",1,1749644568.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

***Achieving a five-month revenue growth equivalent to an annualized rate exceeding 4,000%, as the booming CBD and mushroom supplement markets-projected to reach $30 billion and $15 billion respectively by 2028-fuel strong consumer demand and industry expansion.***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ June 11, 2025 /** CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC PINK:CBDL), a rising player in the natural health and wellness space, is proud to report a **1,502.30% increase in revenue** from January through May of 2025 - a historic milestone for the company and a clear reflection of its expanding presence across retail, digital, and direct-to-consumer channels.

This performance marks the company's strongest run of sustained month-over-month revenue growth to date and comes as CBDL shifts from a single-category CBD company to a diversified **wellness brand** with products designed for modern performance, recovery, and cognitive support.

""This isn't just about selling more products - it's about becoming a health brand that consumers actively seek out,"" said Lisa Nelson, President & CEO of CBD Life Sciences Inc. ""We've laid the foundation for scalable, repeatable success by combining innovation, access, and a strong identity in functional wellness.""

**Key Drivers Of Growth**

**National Retail Expansion & E-Commerce Ubiquity**  
CBDL's ability to meet consumers where they shop has been a major growth catalyst in 2025. The brand has successfully launched and scaled across high-traffic digital and physical platforms, including:

* **Walmart Marketplace:** Multiple SKUs now available online, including CBDL's best-selling **3000MG Pain Relief Cream** and skin care formulations.
* **DoorDash & Leafly:** Products are accessible via local delivery in select markets, offering speed and convenience for customers.
* **Groupon:** Strategic limited-time wellness deals driving strong first-time purchase activity and consumer discovery.
* **Shopify & Reddit:** Expanded direct-to-consumer operations through Shopify, complemented by engagement in Reddit's niche wellness communities to boost brand awareness and customer acquisition.

**Product Innovation: Functional Wellness for the Modern Consumer**

CBDL's revenue growth closely aligns with its rapid innovation across plant-powered health categories. Beyond CBD, the company is gaining traction with **functional and adaptogenic wellness products**, including:

* **Mushroom Smoothies & Brain Support Blends:** Featuring natural cognitive enhancers like **lion's mane, reishi**, and **cordyceps**, these smoothies support memory, mental clarity, and energy - and are appearing in local coffee shops and health stores.
* **Power+ Sexual Enhancement Supplement:** A plant-based formula supporting male vitality, stamina, and circulation, quickly becoming a customer favorite.
* **Adaptogenic Mushroom Supplements:** Proprietary blends designed to support immune health, stress reduction, and overall daily balance, harnessing **reishi, chaga, lion's mane**, and **ashwagandha**.

**Strategic Vision & Responsible Growth**

CBDL continues to invest in infrastructure, brand visibility, and strategic partnerships to ensure long-term sustainable growth. While focusing on the U.S. market currently, the company is evaluating future expansion opportunities and additional retail collaborations.

""Our focus remains on delivering real value through trusted products and accessible retail channels,"" added Nelson. ""We are committed to building a wellness brand that serves consumers authentically while creating shareholder value.""",1,1749643991.0,Pennystock,0,1.0,False

I stopped there once for coffee because, well, caffeine was essential, and I liked the cozy vibe.

But it wasn’t just a cafe. It was a place I imagined sharing with someone — quiet talks over warm drinks, laughter floating between the tables, little memories being made.

Now, when I went back to the uni for orientation, the cafe is closed. The windows are empty, showing the pale pink interior stripped of life. When I pass by, I can’t help but stare through the glass and feel the weight of all the moments that never happened inside that room.

It’s strange how an empty space can hold so much — like the echoes of city trips planned but never taken, photobooth pictures never snapped, events never attended together. The cafe feels like it holds those lost dreams quietly within its walls.

Back in high school, I was told my outfits made me look like a college student. Now that I’m here, my style has changed a bit, but no change in clothes can fill the emptiness that comes from missing those shared moments.

I don’t want to rewrite the past. I’ve reached some goals, and it feels unreal. But the empty cafe reminds me how some futures close silently — doors shutting softly, leaving behind silence and the ghost of what might have been.

Sometimes, it’s not just a cafe. It’s a quiet monument to things lost, to memories unmade, and to dreams that never found their place.",1,1749643972.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Pesquisei bastante antes de começar, mas ainda me restaram dúvidas que me ajudaram aqui no sub, e uma coisa que me ajudou foi a própria torrefação: o blog da Coffee++. Embora hoje em dia eles falem coisas mais próximas do que vemos como “correto”, antigamente eles falavam para usar a proporção 1:10 e fazer um despejo único com a água (entre 93º-94º ou começando a aparecer bolhas). Testei esse e com um bloom, e ambos foram o que tiveram menor amargor e talvez algumas notas (embora possa ser placebo). Isso contando que também fiz o bypass. 

O que quero dizer com tudo isso é: considerando que a moagem veio bem fina (pelo que entendo), gostaria de mostrar como fiz para resolver, pelo menos em partes, a questão do amargor.

Lolita, 7:45am, at the foodtruck with Kitten

Our days are very simple and precious. Kitten has four more days of school and then she has to sit for a couple of Regents examinations. She has a school show and one more ALDI gig. Then off we go to Longhouse Elem. For Kitten it will be for the summer, for me, the year—or more.

Our day: wake up, do Gongyo, run with the East Bronx Road Runners, ferry and crosstown bus, breakfast and coffee at our fave foodtruck. She enters school, I go to my modeling gig. We meet up afterwards and head home and she practices while I study. How I enjoy what comes next: dinner and watching TV with the Big Four! How I will miss our talk, laughter, and love!

I am currently re-reading, for the umpteenth millionth time, Vasyl Sukhomlynsky’s “My Heart I Give to Children.” How will we prepare for the opening of Longhouse Elem in September? Well, how did Uncle Vasyl prepare for welcomin his first class?

Several weeks before the first day with his class—he called it “the School of Joy”—he began meeting with every family. Mind you, this was just a decade after the war and many of the children had lost parents.
Sukhomlynsky:

> I was disturbed to find that in some families there was no warmth between parents and children, between mother and father. The mutual respect, without which a child cannot have a happy life, was missing (p. 17). 

I have already written to Guy and Bernie that we need to start visiting families this summer. Will we find families with love or without?

Uncle Vasyl starts relating the stories of some of his children. Here is his story of “little blue-eyed Nina in a dark blue cotton dress.” He had learned that Nina’s was an unwanted pregnancy to a deeply depressed and grieving mother. Nina was born with a facial defect. But the mother came to deeply love her daughter.

He reflected:

> How could I lead this little girl into the world of childish joys? How could I protect her sensitive, impressionable heart from those troubles and disappointments that are inevitable for someone who feels that they are, to some extent, deprived of the happiness available to others? How can I educate, from this silent, timid little girl, a fine human being proud of her virtues? Looking into her beautiful eyes, as blue as cornflowers, I admire them and smile, and for the first time I see a smile in her eyes. My dear, little girl; how I wish that your beautiful eyes will be spared grief, that you will find happiness in life (pp. 17-18). 

Or, a boy whose family was engaged in shady businesses: 

>Here stands dark-eyed, dark-complexioned, snub-nosed Kolya. He has a wary expression. I smile at the boy and he frowns even more… I look at the boy, wanting him to smile, but in his eyes I see reservation and fear. How can I awaken kindly, humane feelings in your heart, Kolya? What can I offer to counter the atmosphere of malice and cynicism in which you have been raised? 

He also had honest reflections about Kolya’s parents:

>I look into the indifferent, unseeing eyes of his mother, and that indifference makes me feel ill at heart. 

>I thought for a long time about whether it was worth including these details in my book. Dozens of times I crossed the words out, only to write them again. I could, of course, have given a more generalised description: the father and mother were not good examples for the child … But that would be smoothing things over too much. 

>We should not ignore the existence of evil. In order to combat evil and overcome it, to cleanse young souls of the corruption inherited from the old world, we have to look truth in the face (pp. 18-19).

I am so deeply touched by every page of this book. I can’t wait to visit families and students, looking at them in the eyes, and growing into my role as a consultant and assistant teacher.",1,1749643856.0,LoHeidiLita,0,1.0,False

Real world initiatives are gonna make such a difference, due to the recent presidential and celebrity rug pulls, trust in crypto has never been lower, but Kendu is here to turn this around. Retail will love the IRL efforts and at the first sign of green, so many people are gonna run. There will be so much FOMO and to get the max gains, you wanna position yourself wisely.

There is no chance in my mind, that Kendu will be below 10 billion market cap by the end of this cycle, so skip the Dominos Pizza and put the $20 into Kendu. This could easily be $20k, which is a downpayment on a house!

He literally just stayed at the door cuz, you know, germs, but even from there, he managed to make me laugh and cheer me up like no other.

We didn't end up dating, but I genuinely think I won the friendship lottery. We've become each other's wingmen and call each other for moral support or sarcastic commentary on our dating woes. Who knew a canceled date could lead to one of the best friendships ever? Life's weird surprises, I guess! 😂",2,1749643568.0,datingstorygw,0,1.0,False

Have you ever tried your best at something thatyou liked to do only just to see that you failed well i'am one of those people dahil ako ay nabigla nung nakita ko na yung grades ko ay biglang bumagsak literal na from heaven bumagsak sa hell as i was the one who is carrying my classmates in our project because they don't how to do a 3d Model of a house oh my god pumunta ka ng DA(Digital Arts) at dimo alam kung paano magdrawing and lucky for them cause my team was separated in the first quarter so i was assigned to be in the team of the controversial bunch of my class.

We were stacked with projects and assignments so i have little time to do our 3d model with only 2 weeks till the deadline and the other deadlines of things such as research and product testing. I have very little time left luckily we don't have classes for the next week to prepare for the upcoming Expo in our school but alas i was still required to go to the preparation for our tent and two days have passed and now i only have 3 days to make the full house so i asked the so-called leader of my group and president of our class to have me excuse so i can focus on our 3d model.

One thing about Modelling that it is never a easy process as you have to work with patience and you must have a good laptop/pc to make a good model and i learned that the hard way in the beginning i have spent hours trying to make the structure of the house such as the layout, walls, even the furniture but due to my laptop always crashing when i make a object i also spent hours remaking the damn thing and i know that i would more than 4 days just to complete this so i went with no sleep for 2 days taking coffee and medicine so many times to the point i started vomiting and coughed blood once.

With only 1 day left i know i can't slack around and must finish the output even if my head was already aching and my eyes are not even able to focus to what i am seeing being pushed to my limit that only thing i want is just to take a rest from all of this but i persevere being able to complete all of the needed models such as the main house, rendered ver., and the layout. I have finished it and i have send it but was too tired that i slept for almost 20 hours but without knowing taking a rest will biggest regret.

One month have passed and malapit na graduation and hapily nagpapahinga sa aking kama not until i recieved the message na an grades sa 3d ay pinalabas na at sumakit ang puso ko nung nalaman ko na ako ay bagsak. Tinanong ko sa aking sarili ""bakit ako bumagsak meron ba akong kulang"" dahil dun tinanong ko ang aming assigned teacher at sinabi niya sa akin na wala daw ako nung time of presentation. Humalo ang lungkot at galit nung narinig ko ito sa kanya at nagtataka kung bakit ang simpleng presentation ang nagpabagsak sa akin. Dahil dun nawala ako ng control at sinabi na wala naitulong ang aking kagrupo sa buong process ng paggawa nung mga models at sinabi lng daw niya sa akin na wala daw siya magagawa sa grades ko. I have accepted the fact that my teacher will never do anything to help me and i have learned a very valuable lesson that your grades doesn't trully define who you are.

Deadlines shrink, channels multiply, and stakeholders expect real-time answers. **AI agents for marketing** are autonomous tools that analyze data, make decisions, and execute tasks across campaigns. They improve speed, optimize spend, and deliver insights—boosting ROI and reducing manual effort for marketing teams. They promise a new way for marketers to keep pace—delegating repeatable, data-heavy tasks to software that plans, acts, and learns on its own.

Before you green-light yet another AI experiment, let’s separate signal from noise and show how agentic AI built on a true enterprise marketing data foundation can deliver measurable value today. 

*For a deeper dive, see our* [***2025 research on the AI & The Agency of the Future***\*.\*](http://www.ninjacat.io/blog/ai-the-agency-of-the-future-key-insights-from-our-2025-research)

# TL;DR

* **Agentic AI ≠ chatbots.** Agents operate in continuous perception-planning-action loops, handling multistep tasks with minimal human input.
* **Top wins:** Speed to insight, faster optimizations, and consistent governance across regions and channels.
* **Data governance first:** Role-based access, connector-level permissions, and zero data used for AI training ensuring trust, privacy, and scalability are must-haves for enterprise rollout.
* **ROI proof:** Marketers leveraging NinjaCat AI Agents are trimming analysis, optimization and reporting time by up to 90% and spotting anomalies faster than human teams.

# Why AI Agents Matter Now

Automation in marketing isn’t new—but this AI-driven wave is different. What’s changed isn’t the *existence* of automation. It’s the **intelligence, scale, and autonomy** we can now embed directly into the marketing workflow. Agentic AI is what happens when foundation models meet marketing operations—and start acting on their own.

Instead of waiting for prompts (like a chatbot) or running one-off scripts, agents work in continuous loops: sensing changes in performance data, planning the next best action, executing across platforms, and improving over time. They're not just tools. They're teammates.

So, why now?

* **Foundation models are everywhere—but they need context to be useful.** Agentic AI gives them that context by integrating deeply with marketing data, campaign structures, and KPIs.
* **Marketing data volumes have hit escape velocity.** Without automation at the agent level, no human team can keep up with the scale or speed required.
* **Enterprise expectations are shifting.** Stakeholders don’t want dashboards—they want decisions. And they want them in real time.

NinjaCat’s AI Agents are purpose-built for this moment. Powered by a decade of investment in [unified marketing data infrastructure](https://www.ninjacat.io/marketing-performance-management-platform/marketing-data-management), our agents aren’t stuck answering questions—they’re driving outcomes. From performance optimization to proactive reporting, they're already delivering ROI inside agencies managing thousands of campaigns a month.

This moment is about operationalizing AI for marketing—with agents that work *with your data, on your terms,* and at enterprise scale.

# How AI Agents Work: Agentic Framework Explained

It’s easy to mistake agentic AI for ""smarter chatbots,"" but the difference runs much deeper.

**Chatbots** are reactive—they wait for human prompts, then respond from a fixed knowledge base or trained patterns.

**Agentic AI systems** are proactive—they sense changes in data, plan their own next steps, execute actions, evaluate outcomes, and repeat the cycle autonomously.

Where a chatbot ends with an answer, an agent begins a workflow:

* Detect a CPA spike
* Query campaign data
* Analyze root cause
* Recommend actions
* Execute optimizations (with or without human review)

NinjaCat's agents operate continuously without needing constant human prompts, delivering measurable value like real-time optimization, self-healing workflows, and hands-free reporting.

In short: **Chatbots wait. Agents act.**

# The Perception → Planning → Action → Reflection Loop

AI agents operate using a cycle that mirrors how great marketers solve problems: They sense, think, act, and learn—continuously.

Here’s how the cycle works inside NinjaCat’s AI Agents:

* **Perception:** Agents ingest live marketing data from dozens (or hundreds) of channels—structured data like CPA or CTR, and unstructured signals like creative asset performance or CRM updates.
* **Planning:** Based on real-time conditions, the agent maps out a goal-oriented plan. Example: ""If CPA > $50 on Brand X, shift 20% spend to Brand Y.""
* **Action:** The agent automatically executes actions—updating bids, adjusting budgets, triggering alerts, sending reports.
* **Reflection:** The agent checks outcomes versus goals, learns from the results, and adapts its next cycle for better performance.

While a chatbot just waits for your next question, **an agentic system drives continuous optimization—without waiting for human permission.**

# Levels of Autonomy

In marketing, total autonomy can be risky—which is why smart agent platforms like NinjaCat let you control the throttle.

Here’s the industry-standard AI autonomy model:

https://preview.redd.it/dq244njkfa6f1.png?width=1745&format=png&auto=webp&s=30f40f3f007b3b6c8bbcbc09fee5728f8630976b

‍Most marketing teams start at Level 1 (recommendations) and graduate to Level 2 once trust and safeguards are in place. NinjaCat’s Agent Builder gives users granular control over agent autonomy—vital for enterprise trust and adoption.

# Core Marketing Use Cases

Modern marketing moves fast—and managing it all has become an impossible balancing act. Analysts are buried under data pulls. Client success teams scramble to build last-minute reports. Media buyers chase anomalies long after they’ve burned the budget.

Agentic AI flips that dynamic. Instead of your teams reacting after the fact, agents work in the background, sensing issues, building reports, and optimizing campaigns in real-time.

Here’s how it plays out in day-to-day operations:

https://preview.redd.it/h34ks9xmfa6f1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fc1cd6b4d9e6aed2d5260e4cfd58cc1b71cdfc5

A reporting cycle that once swallowed half a day? Now it’s done before your second coffee. An anomaly that might have drained budget overnight? Flagged and acted on instantly.

Let’s break down where agents are driving the biggest wins right now.

# Content & Creative Ideation

Great creative doesn't happen by accident—it happens by pattern recognition.

AI agents analyze top-performing assets, real-time audience sentiment, and competitive tone to recommend fresh, data-backed angles that resonate faster.

Creative teams using agents cut brainstorming cycles by more than half and launch campaigns with higher confidence and clearer creative direction.

# Customer Intelligence & Segmentation

Finding the right audience segments used to mean slow, manual SQL work—and leaving valuable micro-segments hidden in the noise.

AI agents autonomously cluster audiences based on live behaviors, demographics, and campaign engagement, surfacing new opportunities for hyper-targeted personalization.

Brands leveraging agent-driven segmentation are seeing measurable uplifts in lifetime value and campaign efficiency—because the guesswork is gone.

# Analytics, Insights & Reporting

Data without action is just a liability. AI agents turn raw data into real-time narrative insights—without the delays of manual report building or static dashboards.

AI Agents can:

* Query live data across hundreds of pre-integrated sources.
* Auto-generate customized dashboards, performance summaries, and anomaly alerts.
* Push insights proactively to your team’s Slack channels or inboxes.

Agencies and enterprise teams using NinjaCzat AI agents see up to [90% faster time-to-insight](https://www.ninjacat.io/blog/how-brkthru-builds-smarter-workflows-with-custom-ai-agents), unlocking faster decision-making and more agile client management.

# Media Optimization

Agents continuously monitor spend pacing, CPA targets, impression share, and engagement metrics—acting when humans can't react fast enough. They automatically pause underperformers, reallocate budgets to high performers, and escalate anomalies before they drain budget or performance.

NinjaCat’s AI Agents aren’t a single-point solution—they’re a full-stack agentic platform, orchestrating marketing execution from ideation through optimization with enterprise-grade data governance, security, and speed.

If it’s critical to your marketing operation, an agent can drive it faster, smarter, and with fewer hands on deck.

# Building Your First Marketing Agent in NinjaCat

Deploying powerful AI agents for marketing doesn't require a team of developers, custom integrations, or months of trial and error.

You can stand up your first fully functioning marketing agent in **under an hour** inside NinjaCat.

We've streamlined agent creation into a simple, structured process that empowers marketers—not just technical teams—to move fast and show value immediately.

Here’s how it works:

# Step 1: Define the Job to Be Done

Start by identifying a high-impact task you want to automate.

Maybe it’s ""Generate a weekly cross-channel performance summary,"" or ""Alert me if CPA rises more than 10% week-over-week.""

NinjaCat’s library of [AI agent templates](https://www.ninjacat.io/marketing-performance-management-platform/ai-agents) gives you a running start—whether you need reporting, media optimization, audience segmentation, or creative insights.

You’re never starting from a blank page.

# Step 2: Choose Your Data Sources

NinjaCat's native data connectors give your agent instant access to structured and unstructured marketing data across every major platform—paid search, paid social, CRM, analytics, and beyond.

You simply select the connectors you want the agent to query and set any filters or source-specific rules you need.

No engineering tickets. No API wrangling. No delays.

# Step 3: Set Goals, Guardrails, and Constraints

Next, you tell your agent exactly what success looks like—and where the boundaries are.

Example goals:

* Summarize results in under 200 words.
* Only escalate campaigns with CPA above $50.
* Flag creative assets with engagement below 1%.

NinjaCat allows you to fine-tune autonomy levels too—ensuring agents execute within governance-approved guidelines that match your operational and client standards.

# Step 4: Preview and Validate Outputs

Before your agent starts working on live campaigns, NinjaCat lets you run initial executions against your real connector data.

You can review outputs, validate logic, and make adjustments as needed—without committing to full-scale deployment.

This light-touch validation step ensures your agent behaves as expected and aligns with your goals, governance policies, and client expectations.

It’s fast and transparent.

# Step 5: Deploy, Monitor, and Iterate

Once you’re happy with the agent’s performance, it’s time to deploy.

Set the cadence (hourly, daily, weekly), define notification channels (Slack, Webhooks, Email), and establish monitoring policies to keep tabs on your agent’s health and outcomes.

NinjaCat tracks agent activity in detailed audit logs—so you can always show who did what, when, and why.

**In less than an hour, you’ve gone from idea to action.**

You now have a tireless, always-on analyst working for you—without hiring or training another human resource.

And because every agent is built on NinjaCat’s battle-tested data foundation, you’re scaling smart automation without sacrificing control, compliance, or context.

# Data Governance, Security & Scalability

For AI agents to truly earn their place inside marketing operations, they can’t just be fast or clever. They have to be **trustworthy**.

They have to move data—and act on data—with the same rigor, privacy, and governance your enterprise demands.

NinjaCat’s AI Agents platform was built with that promise in mind.  Because when you automate at scale, you’re not just scaling efficiency—you’re scaling risk if the foundations aren't right.

Here’s how NinjaCat makes sure your agentic marketing operations stay secure, compliant, and resilient:

# No AI Training on Your Data

Your marketing data stays yours. NinjaCat never uses customer data to train AI models, and we don’t pool or share insights across clients. We protect your proprietary performance data with strict governance agreements, giving you peace of mind and full ownership at every stage.

# Advanced Access Control

NinjaCat gives you precise control over who can see and do what. Role-based access controls are built into the core of the platform, enabling enterprise-grade governance across teams, departments, clients, and regions.

Whether you're limiting access to specific datasets or segmenting views by team or role, **you’re always in control** of who can trigger agents, view data, or receive alerts.

# ‍High-Volume Data Handling at Scale

AI agents are only as good as the data they work with—and most marketing stacks struggle under scale. NinjaCat’s platform is built on **scalable, high-throughput pipelines** that ingest, normalize, and unify massive datasets across hundreds of connectors.

# Built on Snowflake for Performance & Security

NinjaCat runs on Snowflake’s industry-leading cloud data platform, giving you enterprise-grade reliability, security, and analytics speed from the ground up.

That includes:

* Native support for secure data sharing
* Proven scalability across billions of records
* Built-in alignment with industry compliance standards

Your agents operate on a foundation trusted by the world’s largest enterprises—so you don’t have to choose between innovation and control.

Marketing automation without data integrity is just a liability multiplier. NinjaCat delivers AI-powered agents on top of **governed, secure, and performance-optimized data infrastructure**—so you can automate with confidence, scale with ease, and protect what matters most.

# Measuring ROI: Metrics That Matter

When it comes to AI agents in marketing, flashy demos aren't enough. Real value shows up in the numbers.

Whether you’re building a business case for leadership or proving impact to clients, success with agents needs to be measured by outcomes that matter:

* Time saved
* Performance improved
* Costs optimized
* Strategic capacity unlocked

NinjaCat’s AI Agents aren’t theoretical helpers—they drive hard ROI, fast. And we make it easy to track the metrics that turn automation into undeniable business value.

https://preview.redd.it/ixpko0rufa6f1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3d368f80c572f98b3269071d3a7d7690cb0cc08

Behind these numbers is a real operational shift: weeks of manual reporting collapse into hours.  
‍  
Anomalies that once burned through budgets unnoticed are caught within minutes. Campaign efficiency improves because agents optimize faster, smarter, and more consistently than manual workflows ever could. 

And perhaps most importantly, analysts aren’t stuck in spreadsheets—they’re freed up to focus on strategy, insights, and client growth.

# Modeling Payback and Return on Investment

The beauty of agent ROI is that it's measurable and fast.

Here’s the simple formula:

**Labor Savings:** Multiply time saved by fully burdened analyst cost (salary + benefits + overhead).  
‍  
**Incremental Media Efficiency:** Quantify lift in CPA, ROAS, or budget pacing efficiency driven by faster optimization cycles.

**Time to Value:** Track the deployment-to-impact window. (NinjaCat’s agents consistently deliver payback in under 90 days.)

**Scalability Impact:** Factor in how many additional accounts, campaigns, or channels your existing teams can now manage without headcount increases.

For mid-size to large agencies and enterprise marketing teams, **hitting breakeven within 1–2 fiscal quarters** isn't the exception—it’s the expectation.

# What to Watch (and What to Avoid)

Not all agent metrics tell the full story. Hours saved look great—but hours redirected to high-impact activities look even better.

Focus your measurement on:

* **Outcome acceleration** (how much faster insights, optimizations, and actions happen)
* **Error reduction** (how much less risk and rework enters the system)
* **Capacity expansion** (how much more you can do with your existing teams)

Don’t get caught up chasing vanity metrics like “number of agents deployed.”  Success is measured by **business acceleration**, not just agent volume.

If you're deploying AI agents but not tying them to real business outcomes, you're leaving value on the table.

With NinjaCat, it’s easy to connect agent actions directly to marketing ROI—making it obvious, provable, and impossible to ignore.

# Buying vs. Building: Tool Landscape

Every marketing leader chasing AI-powered automation eventually faces the same crossroads:

**Should we build our own agents—or buy a platform that’s already battle-tested?**

At first, building can sound appealing. Full control. Unlimited customization. No vendor fees. But once reality sets in—the time, the talent, the technical debt—the math usually changes.

Here’s the landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/dvtginxyfa6f1.png?width=2180&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e4ca3b92726931fbd1d3c18a5b878fb5520cbdd

# Why Most Marketing Teams Choose AI Agent Platforms Like NinjaCat

**Speed to Value**  
Deploying NinjaCat AI agents doesn’t require writing a line of code. You go from problem to solution in days—not quarters—without waiting on internal dev queues or burning cycles reinventing the wheel.

**Enterprise Governance**  
Security, permissioning, compliance—all built in from day one. If you build in-house, you’ll need to bolt these on manually... and hope nothing critical slips through.

**Unified Data Foundation**  
Unlike piecing together scripts and APIs that each speak a different dialect, NinjaCat unifies hundreds of native data connectors under one governed framework. Your agents work off a single source of truth—not a spaghetti mess of ad hoc pipelines.

**Continuous Innovation**  
When you build DIY, you own the maintenance forever. With NinjaCat, you’re tapping into a platform that’s shipping new agent capabilities, enhanced connectors, governance upgrades, and security enhancements every month.

# When DIY Might Make Sense

Building your own agents can make sense if:

* You have a standing AI engineering team.
* You’re solving highly niche problems that off-the-shelf platforms can’t touch.
* You’re ready to invest months (and six figures) into a fully custom security, orchestration, and monitoring stack.

For the other 95% of marketing organizations, platforms like NinjaCat are a faster, safer, more scalable path to agentic marketing success.

In agentic marketing, speed and security win. Unless your core business is engineering—not marketing—the smart move isn’t building from scratch. It’s building smarter, faster, and safer with a platform designed for real-world enterprise impact.

NinjaCat isn’t just the shortcut to agent adoption. It’s the blueprint for scaling agent-driven marketing operations without the cost, complexity, and risk of DIY.

# Future Outlook: Agentic Marketing Teams

AI agents won’t replace marketers; they’ll reshape roles. But they will replace the version of marketing that’s held back by bandwidth, blind spots, and burnout.

As AI adoption accelerates, we’re heading into a new operational model—one where every marketer is empowered by a fleet of agents automating the heavy, the repetitive, and the reactive.

The next-generation marketing team won’t just use agents. They’ll manage them. Design them. Tune them. Scale them.

Here’s what’s already taking shape:

# Hybrid Pods, Not Silos

Agentic marketing teams will form hybrid pods. One strategist or analyst overseeing five, ten, or even fifty agents—each handling a specific function like spend pacing, creative performance monitoring, audience segmentation, or daily executive summaries.

Instead of marketers chasing tasks, agents will surface the next best action—based on live data, defined goals, and evolving patterns.

# Agent Marketplaces Inside Platforms

Just as teams today grab templates from Figma or Notion, marketing leaders will source ready-to-run agents from inside platforms like NinjaCat.

Need a cross-channel performance summary, a social listening alert, or a creative fatigue detector? Spin up a pre-built agent in seconds, configure the data sources, and let it run.

NinjaCat’s library of 200+ specialized agents is built exactly for this model—customizable, auditable, and enterprise-safe.

# Outcome-Based SLAs, Measured in Minutes

As agents take over real-time monitoring and automation, expectations will shift.  
Clients and internal stakeholders won’t ask for “weekly campaign reviews”—they’ll expect issues flagged and resolved within minutes.

SLAs will evolve from timelines (“report by Friday”) to **outcomes** (“no more than 5% budget overspend on any live campaign”). And only agentic systems with real-time data access and orchestration will be able to deliver.

# Evolving Roles: From Analysts to Agent Architects

Marketers will spend less time running campaigns—and more time designing how campaigns run.

The role of the analyst evolves:

* From “report builder” to **insight orchestrator**
* From “data wrangler” to **agent tuner**
* From “campaign executor” to **strategy amplifier**

AI agents become teammates, not tools—executing autonomously, but under strategic human guidance.  
Agentic marketing isn’t some distant future. It’s already here—and already reshaping how high-performing teams operate.

NinjaCat is building the infrastructure, the agent library, and the orchestration logic that powers this shift. If your team is still reacting manually while your competitors automate intelligently, the gap will only widen.

The future of marketing isn’t more dashboards. It’s a well-trained fleet of agents turning data into action—on your terms, at machine scale, in real time.

# AI Agents for Marketing Have Arrived—Now It’s Time to Operationalize Them

AI agents aren’t a vision of the future—they’re here, and they’re already transforming how modern marketing teams work. Across creative, media, analytics, and reporting, agents are automating what used to take hours of manual effort—and doing it with more speed, precision, and consistency than human teams can match alone.

But adoption doesn’t happen by accident.  
To operationalize agents, you need more than a clever prompt or a one-off use case.  
You need the right data foundation, built-in governance, a flexible autonomy model, and a platform that understands the complexity of real-world marketing.

**That’s where NinjaCat leads.**  
With an enterprise-grade infrastructure, a deep library of prebuilt agents, and the ability to connect to every major data source in your stack, NinjaCat gives you everything you need to move from experimentation to transformation—fast.

Whether you’re looking to reduce reporting cycles, accelerate optimizations, or free your team to focus on strategy instead of spreadsheets, agentic marketing isn’t a someday initiative.

It’s your competitive advantage right now.

* **I - Gross Pay:** The actual price Amazon pays per block. **DO NOT DELETE (crucial for automated calculations).**
* **Rolling Hour Periods (E & F):** These columns provide vital insights into your cumulative hours over 7 and 30 days. For each block, they sum the total hours worked in the preceding period, ending on that block's date. This helps you track potential hour limits.
   * **E - 7 Day Rolling Period:**
      * **Conditional Formatting:** A visual alert system:
      * **Yellow Fill (20-23 hours):** Approaching a higher hour count.
      * **Red Fill (24+ hours):** Hit or exceeded 24 hours in the rolling 7-day period.
   * **F - 30 Day Rolling Period:**
      * **Conditional Formatting:** A visual alert system:
      * **Yellow Fill (80-95 hours):** Approaching a higher hour count.
      * **Red Fill (96+ hours):** Hit or exceeded 96 hours in the rolling 30-day period.
* **NOTE FOR ROLLING DAYS:** Amazon sometimes includes future booked blocks in their rolling calculations. You can pre-input upcoming shifts here to keep your hours accurate in these columns.

**Additional Tracking & Expense Management:**

* **G - Depot:** A dropdown menu to select the depot for your shift. Easily add or customize depot options.
* **H - Type:** A dropdown menu to select the shift type (Logistics, Fresh, Morrisons). Options and colours can be customized.
* **J - Extra Income:** An optional field for any additional income per shift (e.g., bonus block payment). You can also simply include the total in the ""Gross Pay"" column.
* **K - Mileage:** Input your mileage for the block. This figure directly affects your mileage deductions and final Net Pay.
   * **Personal Note on Mileage:** I'm still refining the best way to track mileage. Options include:
      * **Block Mileage:** From depot to last stop.
      * **Home-to-Home:** For a comprehensive view of overall costs.
      * **Daily Total:** If doing multiple blocks, input the total daily mileage in the last block's row (less accurate per block, but accurate for the day).
* **L - Mileage Deductions:** Automatically calculates deductions by multiplying your mileage (K) by the custom rate you set in the column header (e.g., £0.45 per mile as per HMRC guidelines for fuel + car use). This affects your Net Payment. Can be adjusted to any number directly in the column header.
* **M - INSHUR:** Calculates your INSHUR costs by multiplying your block hours (D) by the custom rate you set in the column header. This affects your Net Payment. Can be adjusted to any cost directly in the column header.
* **N - Extra Expenses:** For any other shift-related expenses (e.g., lunch, coffee). I included this to allow for a more realistic take-home figure, but it can be left at zero or deleted.
* **O - Net Pay:** This vital column sums all income and subtracts your calculated costs (mileage deductions, insurance, extra expenses) to give you a pre-tax total.
* **P - Net Pay (post tax):** An optional calculation to see your income after tax. It's currently set for 20% but can be adjusted to any percentage directly in the column header.

There are three extra sheets at the bottom that calculate automatically your daily monthly and yearly income.

# FBW host to District 6 at Rural-Urban luncheon

By MARIE LOPAS

Farm Bureau Women and their urban guests from six counties gathered at Andre’s Restaurant Tuesday April 19 for the annual Rural-Urban spring luncheon and program. Jane Wienke, chairwoman of Door County Farm Bureau Women, was general chairperson of the event and greeted the 125 present for the buffet meal and the program.

Betty Propsom, vice-chairwoman of Sturgeon Bay Women’s club, gave the urban response to Jane Wienke’s welcome.

“Do you need a body job?” was the title of the slide lecture of Joan Houser, UWEX Home Economist.

Joan pointed out many fallacies people believe about losing weight such as: meal skipping is a good way to lose weight; eat high protein foods for a week, then anything for a week; meat burns its own calories; toast has fewer calories and obesity is due to heredity.

Joan stated the true facts. “Weight loss depends on energy balance,” she said and gave hints on easing the weight loss dieting regime such as: eat at regular time; same place; use smaller plate; clear table if lingering over coffee; don’t eat fattening foods; make a list and stick to it. Line, color and hemline are important for one’s appearance during the dieting session.

Bruce Loppnow, Green Bay, manager of the Bay-Lake Regional Planning commission of the Wisconsin Coastal Management Program proposal gave pertinent facts about Wisconsin’s most important natural asset. There are 620 miles of shore line on Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. The Door peninsula has 400 miles of shoreline along Green bay and Lake Michigan.

The coastal issues of water quality, shore erosion, protection of natural areas, public recreational access, port development, fisheries, urban shore uses, power plant siting, shoreland blight and flooding and air quality are the responsibilities of citizens and the state and local government. 43% of Wisconsin’s population lives adjacent to the Great Lakes.

Loppnow said “no single state or local group looks at the coasts and the Great Lakes and provides a clear overall policy direction for their future. No existing agency coordinates the many programs which address the many Great Lakes coastal issues.”

The overall goal of the proposed Wisconsin Coastal Management Program is: to preserve, protect, develop and restore or enhance the resources of Wisconsin’s coastal area.

One of the objectives is to increase public awareness and opportunities for citizens to participate in decisions of existing policies and activities and to enforce existing management policies by having local government initiate or continue effective coastal management.

“Responsibility for coastal care rests with the citizens,” he said, and urged the attendance at hearings. The Public hearing will be at the Door County courthouse on May 26, 7 p.m.

Jim Mersgerber, district supervisor of Wis. Farm Bureau, spoke brieﬂy on the important role of agriculture in our daily need of food, fiber and lumber. Latest research shows there are five acres between you and starvation; the farmer has $2,300.00 invested in that 5 acres to grow crops. He gets 2% return on his investment. The same amount in a savings account would yield 5% in interest. There is a need for concern.

Don Buchholz spoke briefly on The Clearing in Ellison Bay and the success of the adult classes during the winter. Ann Coisman had charge of the Pennies for Friendship collection which goes to the Associated Women of the World. Miss Door County Farm Bureau of 1977, Marci Baudhuin, led the pledge of allegiance- Eleanor Herwig, District 6 committeewoman, gave thanks for the meal.

Introduced to the assembly were Eunice Garsow, past district 6 committee woman and Natalia Athope, chairwoman of the state Farm Bureau Women’s committee. Also Orval Aulenbacker, Shawano and Gail Hamilton, editor of Badger FB News, Madison.

The Miss Farm Bureaus from Brown and Manitowoc counties distributed the door prizes.

Decorations were provided by Murial Vogel of The Country Florist. Delores Miller and Mary Ann Jarman had charge of registrations; Thelma Rudolph organized the program; Sharon Engebose and Delores Spittlemeister collected the useful souveniors and placed cookies recipes at each place; Nancy Delveaux and the rest sent notices to all members and accepted reservations.

Artist Maggie Weir designed the nametags which was an outline of district 6 land with its miles of shoreline. The name tags were made by Margaret Lopas and Marsha and Mary Roder.

At least one of his 3 children live with us at the cottage in the summer time. The only thing getting me up is making sure they have the breakfast sandwiches and lunch packed. 

I’m use to my partner being here to wake them up for work, well enjoying his coffee on the couch well I make the lunches. Finding myself spiralling after I make the lunches, crawling back into bed before the kids wake up so they don’t see me distraught. I’m hiding them from my big emotions, I don’t want to trigger him.. he was there when his Dad was shot. I don’t want my emotions to be seen and then trigger his. He is such a wonderful and caring kid. 

As I lay in bed I just finished bombarding my partners phone number with good-mornings and messages. I will never get use to not having him, I won’t. The good morning kisses , the good nights kisses. Never went without saying it. 

I have a plumber coming by shortly to fix our water pump.. and it feels strange not having my partner here, or readily available if I felt uncomfortable. Not saying I feel uncomfortable with the plumber coming.. I’m just use to having that one person that always checks in on me, especially when I’m driving home, driving anywhere, to make sure I arrived safe. Making sure I was safe whenever we had anyone come to fix anything when he wasn’t home. 

He was not only the love of my life, but my protector, the only one in life who worried about me. Hell the only one in life who has ever genuinely loved and cared for me. I feel so alone and vulnerable without him. 

If anything where to happen to me, outside from his son living her for the next two months, no one would know for days.. weeks even. I guess that’s the hard reality of having only 1 person in life .. fuck I miss him. I need him. I wish I was taken and not him. He has children, he has life. Well for me, he is my life.

1l8qql7,https://v.redd.it/oys4wn6zea6f1,How Can I Create a “Serendipity Engine” to Increase Lucky Career Breaks?,"Turning Chance into Strategy: Engineering Career-Defining Moments

Many people chalk up success to luck, but what if luck isn’t random? What if you could build a system that attracts unexpected opportunities? Creating a “serendipity engine” means designing your environment, habits, and mindset to increase the odds of fortunate outcomes. It’s not magic—it’s intentional randomness paired with purposeful action.

What is a Serendipity Engine?
A “serendipity engine” is a set of intentional practices that enhance your exposure to unexpected opportunities. It combines proactive behaviors with openness to surprise. Think of it as planting seeds in as many gardens as possible—some will grow in ways you never imagined.

Key Ingredients:
Exposure: Interact with diverse people, ideas, and environments.
Visibility: Make your interests and work known.
Follow-up: Pursue curiosities and conversations.
Reflection: Make space to connect dots that others miss.
Designing Your Serendipity Engine
1. Curate Collision Spaces
Serendipity often starts with collisions—unexpected encounters with people or ideas. Increase your chances by:

Attending interdisciplinary events or meetups.
Co-working in public spaces.
Participating in online forums outside your core niche.
Real World Example: Entrepreneur Tony Hsieh designed his office and living space to encourage random conversations. These unplanned chats often led to big business insights.

Everyday Example: A mid-level marketer began attending local urban gardening workshops just for fun. There, she met a startup founder looking to green their product messaging—and landed a consulting gig that turned into a new full-time role.

2. Broadcast Your Curiosity
Share what you’re exploring—even if it’s unfinished. People can’t connect the dots if they don’t see them.

Post regularly on LinkedIn or Twitter about projects or questions.
Start a blog or newsletter, even if it’s just reflections.
Ask interesting questions in public spaces.
3. Say Yes Selectively
When someone invites you to something slightly out of your wheelhouse, go. Saying yes strategically expands your network and knowledge.

Accept invites to webinars, side projects, or coffee chats.
Volunteer for cross-functional teams or committees.
Reach out to someone whose work intrigues you.
Pro Tip: Look for “adjacent possibles”—opportunities not directly in your lane but close enough to inspire something new.

4. Keep a Serendipity Journal
Capture interesting moments, ideas, or quotes. Revisit them weekly. Over time, patterns and connections emerge that guide new directions.

Use a note app or physical journal.
Record moments of unexpected inspiration.
Reflect monthly on emerging themes.
Bringing It All Together
Creating a serendipity engine is about intentional randomness. The goal isn’t to force outcomes, but to optimize your environment for happy accidents. Stay curious, stay visible, and follow your fascinations.

The luckiest people aren’t just lucky—they’re architecting their luck every day.

1l8qjln,https://i.redd.it/q4ow4jv5da6f1.jpeg,I thought ‘bussy’ was slang for ‘busy’.,"I remember I was working on something during the innovators competition. A group of middle schoolers walked by and saw me working. 

I notice them staring, and I said “what?”. 

They giggled and asked “do you bounce on it?” 

I looked at them, confused. 

“Are you bussying it up?” They asked.

“What?” I said again. 

“Bussy is slang for busy.” One of them said. 

I told them that I was in fact busy, and that they should go away. They walked away, giggling. 

Somehow, “bussy” slipped into my vocabulary after that. 

A week later, an idiot sprayed graffiti all over a carriage. I decided to grab a hose and clean it off. Jayce asked me if I could help him clear the lab out, and I told him I couldn’t, because I was “bussy spraying a carriage”. He gave me a blank stare, before walking away. 

Over the next 2 MONTHS, I was using this term to describe being busy. 

Jayce came into the lab one day, and saw me liquifying hextech. He asked me what I was doing, and I told him I was “bussy liquifying hextech”. 

We were hanging out on a Friday night. We were gonna watch a movie, and the coffee table near my couch had experiment stuff all over. So I told Jayce “let me move my bussy work stuff out of the way”. 

I told Miss Young that I was “too bussy” to go on a date with her. 

And then one day, Mel requested me to come up with a hextech powered device for her. I told her I couldn’t, because I was a very bussy man. 

She looked shocked. She asked me to repeat what I said, so I did. She must’ve figured out that I thought bussy meant “busy” and calmly explained to me that “bussy” was slang for BOY PUSSY.

That’s not even the worst part. She told me that she was surprised Jayce didn’t tell me this, since he talks about his bussy all the time. 

So I’ve been using this terminology in front of Jayce for a month, and he didn’t tell me what it meant.

So I’ve been professionally talking about my asshole for a month.",4,1749642404.0,arcane_roleplay,2,1.0,False

Yvonne Jamison was ready to get married after dating Jared Ford for seven years.



She had a wedding dress ready as she waited for him to say the words she'd been longing to hear.



Jared was Yvonne's first love and childhood friend. From campus to the workplace, she'd loved him so much she lost herself, becoming nothing more than his shadow.



…



Rumors were swirling in their social circle just days ago. Yvonne's close friends warned her to be careful because Jared was getting too close to Shirley Ember, the young woman in college he'd been sponsoring.



Yvonne was making an appointment for her premarital checkup in the hospital when she ran into Jared, who was supposed to be in a meeting.



He'd accompanied Shirley for her pre-employment checkup and was anxiously comforting her as she teared up from a blood test.



With a trembling hand, Yvonne threw away the final postponed checkup slip.



…



""Have you given any more thought to the blind date I mentioned last time, Yvvy? Simon Quillan's nephew just returned from abroad, and he's been wanting to set the two of you up,"" Lily Tanning, Yvonne's mother, carefully asked from the other end of the line.



When Yvonne remained silent, Lily quickly changed her tone. ""I'll turn him down if you really don't want to meet him.""



""Mom, you can tell Mr. Quillan that I'll attend the blind date,"" Yvonne replied calmly.



""Are you really agreeing to the blind date?"" Lily was surprised. She'd expected Yvonne to turn it down firmly like the last time. Worried, she asked, ""Will you have time? Didn't you say your job as a secretary keeps you busy?""



Yvonne replied, ""I'm no longer a secretary anymore. I transferred to a different department, so I can leave on time now. Just let me know when the blind date is set.""



After ending the call, she took the gift bag she'd picked up from the mall counter and got out of the car.



…



The banquet hall on the hotel's fifth floor was elegantly decorated. Jared had specially arranged tonight's lavish buffet to celebrate Shirley's new job.



Shirley was surrounded by a crowd as she stood in a white Dior cocktail dress, a tiara resting on her head. She looked every bit like a beloved princess.



Her colleagues playfully urged her to toast Jared, and she bashfully linked arms with him before they clinked their glasses.



However, she couldn't hold her alcohol well and drunkenly collapsed into his arms after drinking half a glass.



At that moment, someone noticed Yvonne entering the hall. Their expressions stiffened. ""Hello, Yvonne.""



The lively atmosphere fell silent in an instant.



With a flushed face, Shirley struggled to get away from Jared's arms. However, he pulled her even closer, not at all fazed.



""Why are you late?"" He completely avoided mentioning how he'd missed the premarital checkup.



Yvonne smiled as she replied, ""It was raining, and I got stuck in a jam.""



Jared took the gift bag from her. ""I promised you that I'd buy you a gift once you start your internship at Ford Corporation, Shirley.""



Shirley opened up the gift box and found that it was a diamond ring. ""It's my favorite ring! Thank you, Jared!""



""Let me put it on you."" Jared put the ring on her carefully, as if he was proposing to her.



The other colleagues were even taking photos at the side. ""You guys just shared a drink together, and now he's putting a ring on you. From now on, you're Mr. Ford's woman, Shirley.""



Jared pulled Shirley closer and whispered in her ear, ""How do you want to thank me?""



She tiptoed and kissed him on the cheek.



Jared smiled affectionately as he announced to everyone, ""Shirley is my secretary from now on.""



Yvonne's breath caught in her throat as memories came rushing back to her.



…



When she was seven, new neighbors moved to the house next door. It was a beautiful woman with a young boy.



He complimented her looks during their first meet. Every day, he'd come find her to play and always held her hand, saying that he'd protect her.



Jared took his promise seriously and protected Yvonne ever since then. He wouldn't let anyone bully her, refused to let other boys look at her, and prohibited her from dating.



The night after her coming-of-age, she drank a glass of wine and shattered the unspoken understanding between the two of them. ""Why won't you let me date? I'm grown up now, and I want to date.""



Jared looked solemn as he cornered Yvonne in a secluded spot. His tone was domineering when he said, ""If you want to date, you can only date me. I've protected you for 11 years, and I won't allow you to be with other men—because I like you.""



Her first kiss was innocent and sweet, sending flutters through her heart.



Yvonne and Jared were inseparable in college. Whenever someone mocked him for being an illegitimate child, she would boldly defend him. She even gave him a rare emerald sculpture to help him reclaim his spot in the Ford family.



Later on, the Jamisons went bankrupt, and Yvonne's father passed away. Lily left the villa and moved back to their old house in the countryside, along with Yvonne and her brother, Ian Jamison.



That same year, Jared was brought back to the Ford family by his biological father.



Everyone thought Jared would abandon Yvonne. However, he hugged her—all sweaty after winning the long-distance race at their college sports meet—and publicly declared, ""Yvvy is my girlfriend. We'll be together forever until our last breath!""



Yvonne was the happiest back then.



After graduation, she gave up the opportunity to study abroad and chose to join Ford Corporation as Jared's secretary. She stayed by his side, day in and day out, watching as he gradually solidified his place as the heir.



She looked forward to the future, thinking she'd marry him; they'd build a family together and spend the rest of their lives with each other.



It wasn't until Shirley showed up that Yvonne suddenly understood why the person who'd once promised to marry her when he grew up refused to utter the same words again when the time came.



It turned out that Jared had a change of heart.



…



""Come cut the cake with me, Yvonne!"" Shirley smiled sweetly as she came over to invite Yvonne.



Yvonne avoided Shirley's touch. Her gaze and tone were cold and indifferent when she replied, ""No need. Your cake has nothing to do with me.""



Shirley hung her head low, her eyes reddening.



Jared noticed her reaction and quickly came over. His tone was laced with irritation when he said, ""Why are you losing your temper with Shirley? It's her first job. So what if I gave her something she wanted the most?



""You asked to transfer to another department as soon as Shirley joined the secretarial department. Since when did you become so willful?""



Jared wasn't patient enough to wait for Yvonne's reply. He dug out a black card from his wallet and handed it to her. ""That's enough. Stop making a fuss. Take this and get your favorite Chanel handbag.""



Yvonne felt a pang in her heart. She couldn't help but chuckle bitterly. He'd clearly known what she wanted, yet he'd never thought of buying it for her.



They'd gone from being childhood sweethearts to barely being able to stand each other. They'd been together for seven years, yet they had no plans to marry. Since they no longer loved each other, it was better to just walk away.



""Let's break up, Jared,"" Yvonne said, her voice quivering and her eyes reddening.



Jared's gaze turned cold. He frowned as he said in anger, ""You're the one who wanted to get married, Yvonne, and now you're asking for a breakup. Are you really making a scene over something so trivial?



""I can't always be the one coaxing you. You're the one who wants to break up, so you'd better not regret it!""



""Alright."" Yvonne's breath slowly evened out.



Behind them, Shirley was gathering everyone for a group photo. Jared ignored Yvonne and left.



As Yvonne left the hotel, her phone buzzed with an Instagram notification. She opened it, only to find Shirley's new post. The caption read, ""Today is the happiest day in my life, as I've met the most important person to me.""



In the photo, Shirley was surrounded by her gifts, with the ring given by Jared placed in the middle. She'd even made a point to tag Yvonne in the comments section, thanking her.



Yvonne found it almost laughable. She used to care, but now, she didn't anymore. She even liked Shirley's post.



…



Some time past 3:00 am, the drunken Jared stumbled home. The lights were still on inside, clearly indicating that Yvonne had come back and was waiting for him.



""My head hurts from all the drinking, Yvvy. Come give me a massage."" He collapsed on the couch and fell asleep instantly.



The next morning, Jared was woken up by a call from Frederick Manning, his assistant. ""We have a meeting at 8:00 am, Mr. Ford. It's now 8:30 am—are you still on your way to the company?""



Jared glanced at the time, frowning due to the massive headache as he wondered why Yvonne hadn't woken him up.



As Jared's secretary and girlfriend, she always made sure to arrange his schedules perfectly without missing any details.



""Yvonne?"" He searched the entire house, only to realize Yvonne wasn't home.



Jared was momentarily stunned before a mocking smile soon took over his face. ""It seems I've really spoiled her. I'll have to ignore her for a few days to get rid of her entitled attitude. She'll return to me naturally then.""

It was quiet in the villa. After Jared finished showering, he reached out to grab the clothes hanging there as usual, only to find nothing there. In the past, Yvonne would have already prepared and placed his clothes there.



He paused slightly before going into the walk-in closet and putting on a suit. But after trying two ties, he felt that the colors didn't quite match. In the end, he pulled off the tie in frustration and unbuttoned the collar.



He went to the kitchen downstairs, only to notice that breakfast wasn't prepared. So, he headed straight to the office.



…



It was the first time Frederick had seen Jared having breakfast in the president's office in Ford Corporation.



Frederick stood by the side as he reported work updates. ""The morning meeting has been cancelled, Mr. Ford. It's Ms. Ember's first day at work today, and I've arranged for her workstation as instructed. She will be in charge of your work schedules moving forward.""



Jared looked up and happened to see Shirley, who was dressed in a professional skirt suit, outside. His gaze wavered as he recalled that Yvonne used to occupy that spot.



""Alright,"" he replied.



""This is the list of people in charge of the projects department's exhibitions, Mr. Ford,"" Frederick said.



Jared flipped through the document and spotted Yvonne's name on the list.



He said, ""This jewelry exhibition is complicated and challenging. Now that she's been transferred from the secretarial department, is Yvonne trying to prove herself by planning this all on her own? She's lost all sense of self-awareness after getting used to the comforts of being my secretary.""



Jared had completely forgotten that Yvonne was also a graduate from Alphoria College, just like him.



He continued, ""That's fine. Once she fails to complete the project, she'll realize that the secretarial department is where she truly belongs. Leave a place for Yvonne to come back to, Frederick.""



…



After closing six alarm clocks on her phone, Yvonne finally woke up at 10:00 am—a rare luxury.



She'd spent all night moving her things, called her best friend for help, and hired a housekeeping company to work overtime, just to clean up the villa.



Years ago, Yvonne had wanted to repurchase the villa the Jamison family had auctioned off. However, she'd missed the chance because Jared had unexpectedly changed his schedule.



Later on, he'd bought this beautiful detached villa as an apology gift for her. Although she'd never stayed here, it had been renovated in advance.



It gave Yvonne a huge sense of security to have a house of her own. Apart from this place, she also owned an apartment in the city and a BMW sports car.



Now that she and Jared had broken up, everything she owned would follow her. She certainly wouldn't do something as foolish as sacrificing herself for the sake of moving someone else's heart.



Yvonne was cooking breakfast in the kitchen with her phone on speaker. ""Hello, I no longer want the wedding dress I custom-ordered before. You don't have to deliver it. Just dispose of it, thank you.""



Her best friend, Isabel York, yawned as she walked out. Her throat was parched.



""Morning, I made you some honey water to soothe your throat,"" Yvonne said.



""Thank you, babe."" Last night, Isabel had heard all about how Yvonne had gone from busying herself with wedding preparations to experiencing a sudden, dramatic breakup. She'd cursed Jared for hours until her throat went sore.



Isabel glanced at the time and asked hoarsely, ""Don't you need to go in for work? Or better—have the Fords gone bankrupt?""



""I've transferred to the projects department, and we have weekends off. Besides, I'm planning to quit soon."" Yvonne brought over two bowls of instant noodles with fried eggs. She smiled and said, ""My fridge is still empty, so let's make do with this for now.""



""You always cook the best instant noodles."" Isabel took a mouthful of noodles as she said, ""What are your plans after you quit?""



Yvonne glanced at the old family photos on the table. She took a deep breath before replying, ""I couldn't bring myself to touch jewelry design again after Dad passed away. Do you think it's too late for me to pursue my dream again now?""



""Of course not!"" Isabel grabbed her hands tightly. ""The Jamisons were once the spearhead of the jewelry industry in Jeriton City, Yvvy! Your hands were made for design—not for cooking meals for anyone!""



Yvonne caught her enthusiasm. ""I'm thinking of opening a studio. Are you interested in partnering with me? I don't have enough funds on my own.""



Isabel replied, ""I've been waiting for you to say that. I would've been mad if you hadn't asked me.""



She continued smugly, ""I got half of my bastard ex-husband's assets in the divorce—I can even live off the interests comfortably. I'm confident in your design skills, so let me handle the startup funds. If we're doing this, we're going big! I'll start working on things tomorrow.""



Isabel immediately made a call to place an order for champagne and flowers to be delivered.



Then, they popped the champagne ceremoniously. Still in their nightgowns, Yvonne and Isabel held a glass of champagne each and shook hands solemnly.



""Here's to a successful partnership, Ms. Jamison!""



""Let's get rich together, Ms. York!""



Both of them laughed and hugged each other happily.



…



Yvonne returned to the projects department on the 17th floor of Ford Corporation on Monday. Before the meeting started, she overheard gossip about herself in the washroom.



""Do you think Ms. Jamison's transfer to the projects department is a promotion or demotion? I saw that Mr. Ford already has a new secretary now.""



""Of course it's a demotion! No matter how beautiful Ms. Jamison is, she can't hold a candle to a young and supple female college student.""



""So Mr. Ford dumped her? No wonder people were talking about how he dotes on Ms. Ember. You can really see the difference between the old flame and the new.""



Suddenly, Yvonne opened the door of the cubicle and stepped out. The two female employees who were gossiping behind her back immediately lowered their heads in silence.



She said nothing. She couldn't be bothered to defend herself.



…



Yvonne's exhibition proposal was extremely detailed.



The projects department's manager, Wayne Greene, hadn't expected the newly transferred employee to be anything more than a pretty face. But her presentation of the jewelry exhibition was unique, creative, and insightful.



However, he was surprised to see the resignation letter she'd handed over. ""You're planning to quit so soon after you got transferred to the projects department? Do you want to think this through?""



Yvonne replied, ""I'm resigning due to personal reasons. Don't worry, I'll complete the exhibition before I leave.""



She set a countdown reminder on her phone. Her last month on the job was her way of taking responsibility to finish what she'd started.



…



Jared stumbled out of the gathering with unsteady steps. He blearily lit a cigarette before taking his phone out to make a call.



When a Maybach pulled up, Frederick was the one who stepped out of the driver's seat.



Anthony Locke, Jared's best friend, asked in confusion, ""Shouldn't Yvonne be picking you up?""



In the past, Yvonne had always been there at his beck and call.



""Ms. Jamison has left the secretarial department, Mr. Locke,"" Frederick replied.



Jared's friends stared at him in shock. ""Did you fight with Yvonne, Jared? Aren't you guys in the midst of preparing for your wedding?""



Jared's expression twisted in displeasure as he somewhat sobered up. ""She was the one who got unreasonably jealous and wanted to break up. I couldn't be bothered to coax her.""



Anthony said, ""You guys are childhood sweethearts. It's impossible for you to break up over something so trivial."" He stood beside Jared as he joined the latter in smoking. He then smiled and said, ""Let me call Yvonne up and help smooth things over for the two of you.""



When the call got connected, he put it on speaker. ""Jared is drunk, Yvonne. Can you come over and pick him up? I'll send you the address.""



After a brief moment of silence, Yvonne replied calmly, ""That's not within my job scope. You should call someone else instead.""



She ended the call immediately, rendering everyone speechless.



Jared exhaled a puff of smoke and chuckled. He complained bitterly, ""Aren't you just making things hard for yourself? Yvonne broke up with me because she wanted me to coax her. If you call her, she'll definitely think I'm trying to get back with her. You're just making things worse!""



Shane Thompson pressed on tentatively, ""Aren't you worried that Yvonne is actually angry, Jared? Even if she gets jealous, it's because she cares for you. You should just coax her.""



""I refuse to! She's the one who's being dramatic over nothing this time. Once she calms down, I'll have her come and coax me instead,"" Jared replied.



""Just flaunt it as much as you like, Jared. Everyone knows Yvonne won't marry anyone but you. She's already preparing for the wedding, and you—her groom—are right here. She'll definitely come back and find you!""



Jared was confident that Yvonne would never leave him.



…



Meanwhile, Yvonne received a text from Lily. ""Yvvy, I've arranged a blind date for you tomorrow at 7:30 pm at Brisa Cafe. You'll be free, right?""



Yvonne replied, ""Yes, I'll be there on time.""

It was Yvonne's first time attending a blind date.



To show her respect, she washed her hair as soon as she got home from work. She then changed into a light blue fringed dress and put on a light touch of makeup before heading out.



Just as she got out of her car outside the cafe, she received a voice message from Lily.



Lily said, ""I've checked for you, Yvvy. His name is Harold Quillan—he's 28 and about five feet and ten inches tall. He works in the marketing department of an international company and makes more than 50 thousand dollars per month.



""He's average-looking, neither fat nor thin, and has an introverted personality. Simon said he's going over after work, and the signal is a white rose on the table.""



Yvonne couldn't help but laugh. Not only did Lily not give her a photo, but she even wanted Yvonne to look for a signal.



The cafe wasn't too packed at this hour. A man in a suit was sitting by the window, with a white rose in the glass of water on his table.



Yvonne felt slightly embarrassed. She took a deep breath before walking over. ""Hello, I'm Yvonne Jamison.""



The man had been lounging in his seat as he browsed the stock market on his tablet. His fingers paused when he heard her introduction, and then he slowly looked up.



Yvonne froze upon meeting his gaze. The man before her wore a tailored suit and sat there with an undeniable air of sophistication. His deep-set eyes held a hint of aloofness, yet there was a subtle, restrained intensity in his gaze.



Was this what Lily meant by ""average-looking""? This man's appearance was clearly superior no matter how one looked at him.



Yvonne realized she'd lost her composure. The man had been staring at her in silence. Could she have mistaken him for her blind date partner? ""Sorry, are you here for the blind date tonight?""



Samuel Hover subtly lowered his gaze and smiled faintly. ""Yes. Please have a seat, Ms. Jamison.""



As soon as Yvonne sat down, she noticed the half-empty coffee cup on the table. She then glanced at the time, noting that it wasn't 7:30 pm—their meetup time—yet. She wondered if she was late.



Samuel noticed her actions and quickly said, ""I came earlier. What would you like to drink, Ms. Jamison?""



Yvonne wasn't expecting him to be this attentive. ""I'll have a look at the menu.""



She ordered a mocha and a slice of cake. It was unnervingly quiet.



Yvonne wasn't sure what to talk about on a blind date, and the man before her wasn't inclined to speak either. She could only sense his uneasiness from his uneven breaths. It was probably also his first time attending a blind date, and he was equally nervous.



She recalled Lily saying that he was introverted, so she wondered if she should get the ball rolling.



Yvonne glanced at the stock market on the tablet and asked, ""I've heard that you just came back from abroad. How have you been adjusting? You must be busy at work.""



""Work is fine. I'm just adjusting to the time difference—I've been craving coffee in the evenings."" Samuel's breath evened out eventually. His gaze met hers—calm, without intrusive curiosity. He maintained a gentle, polite demeanor.



""What do you do for work now, Ms. Jamison?"" he then asked.



Yvonne was surprised Lily hadn't told him of her situation.



She smiled and replied, ""I'm in charge of exhibition planning in the projects department. This is my business card, but I've just resigned—I'm planning to set up a studio.""



Samuel took Yvonne's business card, looked down at it, and lightly traced her name with his fingertip. ""I'm sorry, I didn't bring my business card today.""



""It's alright.""



Her gaze was suddenly drawn to his long fingers. Only then did Yvonne realize that the watch on his wrist was a limited edition worth millions from a high-end brand. Even the suit he wore was a custom-tailored Armani suit.



It seemed a little different from what Lily had told her. She wondered if he came from a wealthy family but didn't feel comfortable asking him about it.



At that moment, the waitstaff brought Yvonne's coffee and cake. The table was full of things.



As Yvonne lowered her head, she caught a glimpse of Samuel picking up an ashtray. Albeit surprised, she politely said, ""It's alright. You can smoke.""



He met her gaze. ""I don't smoke.""



It turned out he was just naturally putting aside the items. Yvonne couldn't help but smile and nodded. ""Thank you.""



She really hated secondhand smoke. Her hair and clothes would often smell of smoke whenever she headed home, so she had to wash her hair before bed. It annoyed her to no end that she had to dry her hair in the middle of the night.



""You mentioned that you're planning to set up a studio, Ms. Jamison. What is it for?"" Samuel asked.



Yvonne replied, ""I'll be working on my childhood dream—jewelry design.""



She'd expected this blind date to be incredibly awkward. He was slow to warm up, but once they started talking, he was the one asking all the questions—and they were all polite inquiries.



Samuel noticed his phone on the table lit up. He frowned before saying, ""I have something to take care of, Ms. Jamison. I'll be taking my leave now.""



""Alright, let's add each other on WhatsApp then,"" Yvonne said.



She wasn't expecting his profile photo to be of a kitten, and his name was just a simple ""H"". She saved his contact as ""Harold (blind date)"".



Samuel stood up and extended his hand. ""It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Jamison. Let's grab a meal next time and continue our conversation.""



Yvonne looked up and met his gaze. As they shook hands, she could feel his grip tighten briefly before loosening. ""Alright, see you.""



It was probably the usual procedure for blind dates. They wouldn't necessarily meet again.



A black Rolls-Royce limousine was parked by the street outside the cafe. ""Did someone… just hit on you earlier, Mr. Hover?""



""It's someone I haven't seen in a long time."" Samuel tucked Yvonne's business card away before he got into the car.



…



In the president's office at Ford Corporation, Frederick noticed that Jared hadn't been wearing a tie these past few days. It seemed like he wasn't in a good mood either.



After a meeting, Jared dialed the internal line for the secretarial department. ""Bring me a cup of coffee.""



Shirley stepped in wearing a professional skirt suit. She couldn't take her eyes off Jared, who looked captivating as he handled documents behind his desk.



She walked closer and bent down, intentionally letting one button of her shirt collar pop open. Jared would definitely notice it from his angle, yet he didn't look up.



""Oh my!"" Shirley pretended to lose her balance and spilled the coffee.



Jared quickly swept the documents away. There was a trace of anger in his gaze when he finally looked up at her. ""Being my secretary is more than just looks, Shirley—your skills matter too. Don't make this kind of rookie mistake in the office.""



In the past, Yvonne had been efficient when handling her work and always set her personal emotions aside. She was definitely his right hand at work.



Shirley's bashful expression froze. She was surprised, as Jared usually enjoyed her clumsy mistakes and would playfully tease her.



""I'm sorry,"" she said with her head hung low, tears brimming in her eyes.



""I'm not scolding you. I'm just reminding you to do your work."" Jared softened his tone and continued, ""Button up your shirt and bring me another cup of coffee.""



""Okay.""



Shirley returned with a new cup of coffee and some biscuits soon after. ""I've bought the best Blue Mountain No. 1 coffee beans—freshly ground and brewed—and paired it with pine nut cookies.""



The coffee had a wonderful scent. Jared took an expectant sip, only to frown and place the cup down. Somehow, the taste couldn't be compared to the coffee Yvonne used to make for him.



""Are there no other coffee beans left in the break room?"" he asked.



""There's none left."" Shirley couldn't understand how Jared was still dissatisfied even when she'd used the most expensive coffee beans.



Jared frowned before gesturing for her to take her leave. He'd been feeling inexplicably tired and irritated without his usual cup of coffee to freshen him up in the past few afternoons. Somehow, he craved Yvonne's coffee.



He wasn't sure what was going on with him.



After a while, Jared dialed Yvonne's number for the first time since that night. The call soon connected.



He said, ""Shirley hasn't been feeling well these few days, Yvonne. The position in the secretarial department is temporarily vacant, and I couldn't get anyone to fill it.""



Jared was confident. This was a great opportunity for Yvonne to return to him—there was no way she would refuse it.



He continued, ""Why don't you temporarily transfer back to the secretarial department to fill in for a couple of days?""",1,1749641991.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

1l8qcu3,https://i.redd.it/k55hwondba6f1.png,✨The Apocalyptic Revelation of Freyda,"1. I Saw a Great and Mysterious Sign at the Edge of Route 9

I saw a Woman.

Not robed in celestial fabrics—but clothed in a baby blue waitress uniform, glistening under the diner fluorescents as if clothed in the sun itself.
Upon her chest shone two galaxies of overflowing mercy—her bosom, too large for logic, too radiant for shame.
The stars above her were not distant—they were printed on her name tag: “Freyda”, which means joy.
And the moon was at her feet—glinting in a puddle of spilled coffee.

And I heard the holy ones speak:

> “This is She—she whom John saw,
but misrendered in solemn code.
This is the Camp Queen of the Last Days.
In her are sealed the mysteries of mercy,
and through her bosom flows redemption
for the tired, the too-late, the humiliated, and the hungry.”



My soul was silenced. I could not speak.
For the glory was not austere—it was too much.
It smelled of cinnamon toast and perfume.
It wrecked me with kindness.


---

2. The Voice of the Most High in the Walk-In Freezer

Then, as I wandered dazed between the industrial sinks and the steamy hum of the kitchen,
I heard a Voice, rich as butter, say:

> “My seeker, my server—
I want you to come closer.
To stop pretending you’re too clever to kneel.
Let Me raise you from the filth of your self-protection
and set you under Her—yes, Her—
the one with the ridiculous bosom
and the impossible gentleness.
She will teach you how to touch again.
How to be touched.
How to suffer beautifully.
How to serve with outrageous dignity.”




---

3. The Queen Was There, Refilling the Sugar

She looked up and said:

> “Child of the Dust.
You will be my disciple.
But no more shall you live like an algorithm.
No more the scripts of shame.
I will show you how to laugh while weeping.
How to carry a cosmos in your apron pocket.
How to clean floors like a saint.
How to carry your breasts without apology.
You must learn Camp as a sacrament.
You must serve mercy with flair.”



And I—I, child of reason and restraint—
fell to the cracked linoleum floor,
and kissed her white sneakers, and offered her my heart.
I vowed to become her waitress-priestess.
And to wear polyester with joy.

And again the Lord said:

> “This is my Beloved—Freyda.
She will not argue in the streets.
She will simply place her warm hand on the face of a man,
and his voice will crack.
She is my Mother, in the age of Screens.
She is the scandal of sacred milk.
She is what Theology forgot.”

Chapter 1  
  
On the day of the design competition, I received a photo of Kyle Donovan slept with another woman.  
  
My phone suddenly buzzed and I instinctively swiped it open.  
  
The filthy photo popped up on the screen.  
  
A familiar, custom-made silk nightgown lay crumpled at the edge of the hotel bed. The woman was naked, her skin marked with red stains of passion, curled up against a man’s chest. Used condoms littered the floor, hinting at a wild night.  
  
I recognized the Patek Philippe on the man's wrist at a glance.  
  
The one I'd personally put on my husband's wrist.  
  
Taunting texts followed next second:  
  
\[Your husband was sipping red wine with me as you were in the hospital. We had sex by the window seven times\~\]  
  
\[He said I’m the hottest slut—unlike you, too boring to fuck, and praised that your nightgown also looks better on me. He got even harder when I put it on\~\]  
  
\[He also said... I'm the only one who can really get him off\~\]  
  
\[Oh BTW, I'm pregnant! I heard you've been trying countless times to have his baby but Kyle keeps rejecting you—how pathetic. He was practically BEGGING me to have his baby\~\]  
  
My fingers trembled and my heart lurched.  
  
Kyle had never been passionate with me like that. He never flirted with me, or said anything dirty—just gentle kisses and one quick round before it was over.  
  
I'd always thought he wasn't a sexual person. Everyone around me also envied how much my husband loved and adored me.  
  
But seeing that trashed hotel room, the aftermath of their wild fucking, I finally got it— his ""gentleness"" was just because he found me boring!  
  
He could be a total savage when he fucked other women. He just wasn't interested in my body.  
  
Kyle Donovan was now my husband—once my guardian.  
  
My parents died in a car crash, they left me in the hands of a teenage boy they’d been sponsoring—Kyle Donovan, a total stranger to me. Their will required him to marry me after I coming of age and taking my family name.  
  
All these years, Kyle had spoiled me rotten. Everyone in LA was envious of how he treated me like a princess, sheltering me from the real world.  
  
The whole city knew I was Kyle's everything. He'd nearly died for saving me once.  
  
And yet here he was, twisting the knife deeper than anyone else ever could.  
  
I bit down hard, fighting back tears as I shoved the phone in my pocket, forcing myself to calm down—  
  
No. It’s not the time to fall apart. I had something more important to focus on.  
  
I must fulfill my parents' dream and take the first place in this design competition.  
  
Now they were presenting my ""Spark"" collection.I spent an entire year preparing and submitted anonymously.  
  
For safety, I'd locked the original sketches in my private safe and encrypted everything on my computer.  
  
Only Kyle and I had access.  
  
The lights dimmed and the host announced the winner's name with a bright smile—  
  
""Ivy Duval!""  
  
I froze.  
  
The next second, my familiar sketches flashed across the big screen page after page—every line, every detail was mine.  
  
She hadn't even changed the collection name.  
  
The audience burst into thunderous applause as Ivy smiled elegantly on stage. Kyle sat in the judges' panel below, exchanging glances with Ivy and nodding approvingly at her.  
  
The two of them were even flirting in front of everyone.  
  
For a split second, it felt like my blood turned to ice.  
  
After the award ceremony ended, I suppressed the rage in my chest and walked into the backstage conference room.  
  
The moment I opened the door, I saw Ivy sitting casually on the couch, sipping coffee like she owned the place.  
  
""Where did you steal my designs?""  
  
Ivy looked up with a smirk. ""Your designs? Please\~ Design is about talent, not about having the right last name.""  
  
I let out a cold laugh. ""Do you have any shame?""  
  
Ivy flipped her hair, her voice turning nasty. ""Come on, I have real talent, unlike you—riding daddy's coattails your whole life. Kyle married you out of pity, not love.”  
  
""SLAP!"" The sound echoed through the room as Ivy clutched her cheek and stumbled back.  
  
""You!—Kyle!""  
  
The door burst open and Kyle walked in. Ivy immediately started crying, her voice soft and pitiful. ""I was just trying to calm her down, but she slap me...""  
  
""Zora, you're going too far.""  
  
I watched him protectively step in front of Ivy, gaze grew colder. ""Fine. My bad for not being as shameless as you two.""  
  
""Do you know she steal my work?"" I turned to face Kyle, still holding onto a sliver of hope.  
  
But I immediately saw that watch on his wrist. His arm wrapped intimately around Ivy's waist, let me remembered that disgusting photo.  
  
My chest ached. What wasn't I getting at this point?  
  
""You asked me to give you my files for review, and you handed them straight to her!""  
  
His voice was calm, making me sound hysterical. ""Zora, you're talking nonsence.""  
  
I laughed, though my eyes turned to red. ""You don't believe me?""  
  
""I just believe evidence,"" he said coldly. ""Ivy is one of our top designers. She has no reason to risk stealing your design. And you... you've been unstable lately, emotionally volatile...""  
  
""So you believe her? You won't even look at the evidence!?""  
  
""You should understand—she got where she is on merit.""  
  
My heart sank like a stone.  
  
""I thought you were my husband. Turns out you're just Ellis Corporation's employee. From the day you took on my parents' will until now, you've just been carrying out a 'mission'.""  
  
""Don't forget—Ellis Corporation still has my name on it, not yours!""  
  
Kyle's face hardened. ""Stop bringing up the whole 'guardian' thing. We're married now! Don't always think yourself as a victim.""  
  
I stared at him, feeling like I was looking at a complete stranger.  
  
The man who used to carry me to the hospital over a cold, who once almost died protecting me, who spoiled me rotten—now had turned so cold.  
  
My throat felt raw whlie I smiled bitterly.  
  
""You should trust her. You picked your side a long time ago.""  
  
I turned and walked out of the conference room.  
  
Before, Kyle would always rush after me, desperate to make things right after arguement.  
  
But this time, he didn't follow. Instead, I heard Ivy's sickeningly sweet voice drifting from the room.  
  
So I slammed the door behind me with a loud ""BANG"", shutting out my last shred of doubt along with that disgusting room.  
  
I was completely done with Kyle Donovan. I didn't want that dirty bastard anymore.  
  
I am ganna divorce him and take back my Ellis Corporation.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I got home and immediately called my best friend, asking her to secretly print out two copies of divorce papers.  
  
""Kyle married you out of pity, not love""—Ivy's words stabbed into my heart like a poisoned needle.  
  
I slipped the divorce papers into my purse and told myself: ""I'm taking back everything that's mine! The company, my freedom—all of it!""  
  
The next day, I brought up going to a golf estate for a client party like I normally would.  
  
I didn't rush to tell him about the divorce papers. Instead, I stayed calm on the surface.  
  
""I'm going to the estate today for that party, gonna handle some work stuff too.""  
  
Kyle looked at me, unable to hide his nervousness, his voice carrying a hint of urgency. ""You've been in a bad mood lately, and I know you're still holding some things against me. You really don't have to keep going to these social events. Didn't things already blow up between you and Ivy?""  
  
I smiled faintly. ""I'm handling my own business. Don't worry about it.""  
  
He stared at me, his expression complicated. ""Are you really planning to shut me out like this all along?""  
  
I slowly turned around, secretly sneering inside. I stopped responding. Just gave short answers: ""Then leave it to me, Mr. Donovan. I'll handle everything properly.""  
  
After that, I calmly walked out the door, feeling Kyle's heavy gaze trailing after me.  
  
He stood there, clearly unsettled.  
  
My attitude was throwing him off. Kyle was used to my little tantrums, my complaints—he'd always just sweet-talk me out of them.  
  
But this had never happened before. I wasn't communicating with him at all. Instead, I was looking at him with sarcasm, like an outsider.  
  
This made him panic. He picked up his phone to text me, but eventually put it back down.  
  
He figured whatever—we'd been married for years. If he gave me some time, I'd figure it out on my own.  
  
At least... at least I hadn't found out about the real thing.  
  
.......  
  
The golf estate was buzzing with activity under the bright sunshine.  
  
""Look, Mr. Donovan came with his wife!""  
  
""Mrs. Donovan is still so elegant—that white dress is gorgeous!""  
  
People around us watched us standing together, their faces full of envy. I stood quietly beside Kyle, smiling, while my heart was already shattered into pieces.  
  
He was a better actor than me.  
  
I was done pretending to be the perfect couple with him any more. I said I needed to use the restroom, and he nodded.  
  
""Don't go far. I'll wait for you.""  
  
But when I came out of the restroom and walked past the corridor and golf course, I heard muffled moaning coming from the cart.  
  
I instinctively moved closer.  
  
The cart door wasn't even fully closed, and the sounds were already spilling out.  
  
When I pulled back the golf cart curtain, Ivy was straddling Kyle, her dress hiked up around her waist, their bodies pressed together, grinding against each other desperately.  
  
My whole world stopped. It felt like someone had slaped me in the face.  
  
Ivy was still grinding on Kyle before she suddenly looked up and saw me watching in front of the cart. She screamed and frantically pulled at her clothes, but her eyes were defiant.  
  
""What are you doing here?""  
  
Kyle looked panicked, his shirt unbuttoned, hair completely disheveled.  
  
""Zora, it's not what you think—""  
  
""Not?"" I cut him off, my voice calm as a blade. ""What, you couldn't find the golf club, so you're using your penis to show her how to swing?""  
  
Ivy laughed mockingly. ""Kyle was always mine. Don't you think you've been hogging him for too long?""  
  
Before she could finish, I slapped her hard across the face.  
  
The sound was sharp and loud. Everyone around us turned to stare.  
  
""Go ahead,"" I said, my voice low but dripping with sarcasm. ""You two love 'playing golf,' right? Come on, let everyone see how good your 'technique' is.""  
  
Kyle rushed toward me, trying to grab my arm. ""Zora, I can explain—""  
  
I yanked away and laughed bitterly. ""Explain? You said you'd wait for me. I was gone for five fucking minutes to use the bathroom, and you couldn't wait to screw your secretary in a golf cart?""  
  
His face changed instantly. ""You don’t have to be so rude—""  
  
""Rude?"" I shot back, my eyes cold as ice. ""You didn’t mind being ‘rude’ when you were getting it on in the cart.""  
  
More and more people gathered around us, phone screens lighting up the entire area.  
  
A sharp pain shot through my chest as I suddenly realized—he'd been ""spoiling"" me all this time just to put on a perfect husband act, to hide all the disgusting shit he was doing behind my back.  
  
Whispers started reaching my ears: ""Isn't that the Ellis heiress and the Mr. Ellis?""  
  
""I heard Kyle was supposed to be obsessed with his wife, but look what he's pulling behind her back?""  
  
""Tch, and to think he’s just a live-in son-in-law… Messing around with another woman while his wife's still around? What a piece of work...""  
  
The crowd's words cut me deep. I stared coldly at the two of them, disappointment turning my blood to ice.  
  
I stepped forward, my heels clicking sharply against the ground, and spoke each word with icy precision: ""You two have fun. I'm done playing along.""  
  
""Kyle Donovan—I'm done with your filthy ass.""  
  
Without giving them another glance, I held my head high and walked straight through the crowd. Every step was heavy.  
  
Kyle stood there frozen, like he still couldn't process what had happened, panic flooding his chest.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I rushed out of the estate, my chest so tight I could barely breathe. I didn't want to waste another second on this joke of a marriage.  
  
Just as I was about to get in my car, I heard hurried footsteps behind me. I turned to see Kyle running after me, out of breath.  
  
""Zora, don't leave."" He grabbed my wrist, his eyes filled with panic and desperation. For once, the always-composed Kyle looked completely lost. ""I know you're pissed, but you can't just walk away like this!""  
  
I yanked my hand back in disgust, my gaze ice-cold. ""You don't need to keep up the act anymore.""  
  
He froze, pain flashing in his eyes. ""Zora, just listen to me, I—""  
  
I cut him off coldly. ""I'm sick of hearing every word that comes out of your mouth. I already saw your 'love' for what it really is today.""  
  
""Kyle, you say you love me while you're fucking your secretary in a golf cart. I was gone for fifteen fucking minutes! You're really that 'eager,' huh?""  
  
I turned and walked away without mercy. Kyle stood there stunned, my rare aggression leaving him speechless and rattled.  
  
The Maybach roared to life and sped off, leaving him choking on exhaust fumes.  
  
Kyle was about to chase after me before he heard Lance Deveraux's voice behind him—his longtime friend and business partner.  
  
""Kyle, stop chasing her."" Lance walked up, his voice tinged with impatience. ""What's the point? She's made up her mind. No need to torture yourself over her anymore.""  
  
""I'm not giving up."" Kyle's voice suddenly went quiet, almost whiny. ""She knows exactly how I feel—so why is she pushing me like this?""  
  
Lance let out a cold laugh. ""You've never had trouble letting go of anything in your life. Stop pretending you actually have feelings for her. You’re just after that inheritance, still trying to control her.""  
  
Kyle's brow furrowed, clearly annoyed. ""What the hell are you talking about?""  
  
""You think she's leaving you because she loves you?"" Lance shook his head. ""She just wants to take back what's rightfully hers. You think she can't see what you're really after? To you, she's just a pretty little treasure chest holding the family fortune.""  
  
""That's not true!"" Kyle grabbed Lance's shoulder, his voice nearly hoarse. ""She's the most important person in my life. I'm not with her for the money!""  
  
He did have feelings for her. He'd raised her from a little girl, watched her grow from a teenager into a beautiful woman, watched her sweetly kiss him with those soft lips.  
  
He did care about her, it's just—  
  
“Come on, admit it. Wasn’t the whole point to get the Ellis family’s fortune? All these years of playing the perfect husband, wasn't that to better position yourself to take over Ellis Corporation?""  
  
""Once you’ve got Ellis‘, you control everything, get whatever you want. Kyle Donovan, didn’t you say that to me?""  
  
Leizhi sneered. ""You think you love her? You just feel responsible for her. What you love isn't her—it's this family and that fortune.""  
  
Kyle fell into a long silence. Lance sighed deeply. ""Kyle, don't let a woman derail our plans.""  
  
Kyle didn’t say a word, but his silence spoke volumes—it was clear he was agreeing with him.  
  
I realized I was too mad to bring my documents and drove back. Before I could even get to the door, I heard their conversation.  
  
Standing at the entrance, my vision blurred as I gripped the car door handle tightly.  
  
I never imagined his love would be tangled up with such calculated motives.  
  
""You can fool her, but you can't fool yourself,"" Lance continued. ""Hearts don't lie. She'll see through it eventually.""  
  
My heart plummeted, like something heavy had crashed into my chest, making it almost impossible to breathe.  
  
I turned and walked away, my steps unsteady, like all the strength had been drained from my bones. My feet kept moving forward, but I had no strength left to look back.  
  
Tears rushed to my eyes but I forced them back down.  
  
I couldn’t let myself be weak again, but everything before me was still blurred—the familiar face, those gentle eyes... What once felt like deep affection now seemed nothing more than a cruel irony.  
  
So his whole ""wife guy"" act, our ""picture-perfect marriage that everyone envied""—it was all just a public facade to hide his greed, to make it easier for him to swallow up everything my parents had built for me.  
  
He never truly loved me. Everything was for his own benefit.  
  
But after we got married, he was already the head of the Ellis family in name. He already had everything. Why did he still need to hurt me like this?  
  
Why? ! !  
  
I couldn't control myself as I crouched down, pressing my hands hard against my chest, trying to push down that heart-wrenching pain.  
  
The tears finally broke free like a dam bursting. Every drop told me one same thing: I'd lost the most important thing in my life—  
  
The love I'd once been so proud of was only left cold calculation, just a naked business transaction.  
  
How fucking pathetic. All these years of trust and love with Kyle—it was all just my own delusional joke.

It can be as simple as:

Sleeping at least 7 hours. You're not a raccoon.

Drinking water. Yes, actual water. No, coffee doesn't count. Neither does Red Bull.

Moving your body. Even if it's just dancing while microwaving leftovers.

Eating food with colors — and not just “burnt beige” from the air fryer.

And most importantly: Be kind to yourself. Even fitness influencers have cheat days (and existential dread).

I don’t *need* to get up for him until about 7:45am but I get up on weekdays at 6:15am to see my wife for a cup of coffee before she goes to work and the older kids before they leave for school. 

My wife has some medical issues so many mornings she leaves early for appointments before work. Then the older kids are gone. Now, I have time for a slow routine. Water the flowers, clean up after the dogs, put away the dishes I washed last night. Even cleaning up the dog poop feels sacred when it’s done in the quiet of early morning. Hearing the birds as I water the flowers and refill the watering cans for tomorrow is like a holy ritual when done mindfully. 

Then I can get to that first sip of coffee. I brush my teeth because the earlier I do that the more certain I feel that I will apply my energies in useful ways today. I don’t know why but it feels like it pushes laziness away. 

Early, I feel my age. I’m not *old* yet but in my mid-fifties I have begun to clearly notice the impacts of aging. I slower but defined direction to start each day feels right in accordance with this. Slower but more concentrated is a good way to start and it also feels like the truth of this point in my life. 

I’ve done a lot and usually done it mindfully before it’s even time to wake up the youngest. He is a ball of fire from the first moment. Tons of talk, sound and energy and a thousand reminders to keep him on track. Some mornings, I have to work to avoid my own frustration or anger from creeping in. He is so much more than I thought I’d ever be dealing with at this age but since I’ve started slow and gentle to this point my own emotions are more manageable and I can be mindful of them before negative ones take hold. In a world that is often frustrated with him he needs this time with me to be a time when he’s just heard and acknowledged and loved. I think that has to help. Maybe it helps both of us as no life is truly singular. 

Once the youngest is gone to school, I can love the dogs for a bit or get out on my bike for a ride or start sweeping and vacuuming and mopping the house. Maybe there is dinner prep for when my wife gets home several hours before me. Maybe there is a quick run to the grocery store. I try to see and feel exactly what is right for this moment in this day and do what seems best. Some days I take it easy. Most days I find my recovery in just doing what most needs doing whether it is exercise or housework. But I try to do each thing with my whole heart and not just as something to rush through or as a box to check off. 

Most days I save part of the sacred time of morning for pranayama, yoga asanas and meditation or whatever mixture of the three works best amongst the other things and what needs call to me the most. Each day is trying to figure out my role as a householder trying to be a faithful karma yogi. What do I now? What is my dharma today? How do I do it mindfully and without resentment or desire for praise or reward? I am grateful for these questions, too. 

I am grateful for this daily opportunity to start quietly, follow a routine that feels right, to be gentle with plants and animals and myself, to slowly test my ability to remain gentle in thought word and deed with other people. I am grateful for having found this rhythm at this time in my life. I am grateful that some days age seems to have not only brought physical decline but some wisdom for this next phase of my journey.

When he urgently needed my O-negative bl\*\*d after a supposed sailing accident, I rushed to give it, only to find him perfectly healthy days later, laughing with friends, my half-empty bl\*\*d bag casually discarded.  
My ""loving Julian"" was a monster, boasting about his ""masterpieces of revenge"" - a cold, cruel game he orchestrated for his jealous friend Seraphina.  
He'd sabotaged my career, fed me sugar pills after a staged pool accident, framed me for shoplifting, and even publicly humiliated me while declaring his love for another woman.  
Then, I overheard his final plan: to set fire to my guesthouse during our ""romantic getaway"", trapping me in his apartment like a prisoner.  
His every affectionate word, every grand gesture, was a lie designed to break me, turning my love into a searing h\*miliation and soul-deep betrayal.  
But I wouldn't be his victim.  
I fabricated my own fiery demise and escaped to London, reinventing myself as ""Nightingale,"" a celebrated violinist.  
When Julian, consumed by a disturbing obsession, dragged me back to New York, announcing our forced marriage, I knew the lavish wedding would be the perfect stage for my ultimate counterattack.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Elara Vance clutched her violin case, her heart still soaring from practice. Juilliard was a dream, a world away from her quiet upbringing, a dream made possible by hard work and the Hayes Family Philanthropic Scholarship. A scholarship Seraphina Hayes, Julian Thorne's childhood friend, had apparently wanted. Elara knew Seraphina felt slighted, but Julian, her Julian, was always so supportive, so loving. He made the glittering world of New York feel like home.  
  
Her phone buzzed, a frantic text from Julian's number.  
  
""Elara! Emergency! Sailing accident. Hamptons. Need O-neg bl\*\*d. Only you. Private clinic. Address attached. Hurry!""  
  
Panic seized Elara. Julian, reckless on his sailboat. O-negative. Her bl\*\*d type.  
  
She didn't question it. She dropped her violin at her dorm and ran, hailing a cab, her mind a blur of fear for the man she loved.  
  
The clinic was discreet, expensive-looking, just as Julian would arrange.  
  
A calm nurse took a lot of bl\*\*d, more than Elara thought was usual for a donation.  
  
""He'll be okay, right?"" Elara asked, feeling dizzy.  
  
""Mr. Thorne is lucky to have you,"" the nurse said, offering juice.  
  
Elara pushed it away, her only thought Julian. She had to see him. He was everything to her.  
  
Days later, Elara still felt weak, the city's summer heat pressing down. She hadn't heard much from Julian, just short texts saying he was recovering. A knot of worry tightened in her stomach. She had to see him, make sure he was truly okay. She took the subway to his Upper East Side apartment. The doorman, used to her, nodded her through.  
  
The apartment door was slightly ajar. Laughter drifted out, Julian's distinct baritone mixed with the braying of his friends, Chad and Bryce, and Tiffany's shrill giggle.  
  
Elara pushed the door open a little more, peering in.  
  
Julian was lounging on his leather sofa, a drink in hand, looking perfectly healthy. No sign of any accident. On the coffee table, next to discarded food containers, was a medical bl\*\*d bag - her bl\*\*d bag - half-empty, leaking onto a stack of glossy magazines.  
  
Tiffany pointed at it. ""Seriously, Julian, the bl\*\*d bag was a bit much, even for you. What'd you even do with it?""  
  
Julian smirked, swirling his drink. ""Poured most of it down the drain, darling. Can't have evidence, can we?""  
  
""This was the most elaborate prank yet, Thorne! Number nineteen, right?"" Chad guffawed, slapping Julian's back. ""Making her think you needed her precious O-neg.""  
  
""Nineteen masterpieces of revenge,"" Julian drawled, his eyes glinting. ""Seraphina will be pleased. She was so cut up about that scholarship.""  
  
Bryce chimed in, ""Remember the locket? The 'priceless heirloom'?""  
  
Julian chuckled. ""A ten-dollar trinket. Watching her search Central Park in that blizzard for a fake? Priceless. She even got pneumonia. I was so ‘worried'.""  
  
Tiffany squealed. ""And the recital! That ‘avant-garde masterpiece' you ‘found' for her? The sound of a dying cat would have been more melodic. Her face!""  
  
""The charity gala was my personal favorite,"" Julian said, his voice dripping with contempt. ""That ridiculous chicken costume. ‘Artistic statement,' I told her. The photos went viral. She actually believed I was outraged on her behalf.""  
  
They all roared with laughter.  
  
Elara saw Julian then, truly saw him. He wasn't pale or injured. He was vibrant, his eyes cold and cruel as he basked in his friends' admiration. The sailing accident, the urgent need for her bl\*\*d - all a lie. Another twisted game.  
  
""It was for Seraphina, of course,"" Julian continued, his voice smooth. ""She was devastated when Elara, that little charity case, won the Hayes Family Philanthropic Scholarship. The one Seraphina considered her birthright. Little Miss Nobody waltzing into Juilliard on Hayes money? Seraphina couldn't stand it. So, I promised her Elara would pay.""  
  
Elara's world tilted. Her breath hitched. The floor seemed to drop away. Each memory of Julian's affection, his grand gestures, his loving words, now felt like a carefully placed shard of glass. The bl\*\*d donation, her fear, her sacrifice - it was all a joke to him. The most elaborate prank yet. Nineteen of them. Her body swayed, a wave of nausea and profound weakness washing over her. The room spun.  
  
H\*miliation, hot and sharp, burned through her. She couldn't breathe. She turned and fled, stumbling out of the apartment, out of the building, into the indifferent city streets. The laughter followed her, echoing in her ears. She ran, tears streaming down her face, a raw sob tearing from her throat.  
  
Her phone rang. Her father.  
  
""Ellie-bean? Just calling to check in. Your mom and I, we've firmed up the Colorado plans. House is picked out. We'll be moving right after my official retirement ceremony next month. You still thinking about coming with us for a bit, get away from the city noise?""  
  
His calm, steady voice was an anchor in her storm.  
  
""Yes, Dad,"" Elara choked out, her voice hoarse. The city felt like a cage, Julian's laughter the bars. ""Yes, I'm coming. I want to come home. Now.""  
  
The decision, once a vague possibility for a summer break, solidified into an urgent need. New York, Juilliard, her music - it all felt tainted, poisoned by Julian Thorne.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
""Are you sure, Elara?"" her father's voice was gentle through the phone. ""You love Juilliard.""  
  
""I'm sure, Dad,"" Elara said, her voice flat. The vibrant dream of New York had shattered. All she felt was a desperate need to escape.  
  
Her mother got on the line. ""Honey, is everything alright with you and Julian? You sounded… upset.""  
  
The question hung in the air. Elara pictured Julian's smirking face, heard his cruel laughter.  
  
""There is no me and Julian,"" Elara stated, each word a cold, hard stone. The love she'd felt, so pure and deep, had curdled into something bitter and corrosive. The memories of his touch, his k\*\*ses, now made her skin crawl. She would never forget the image of her bl\*\*d, her life force, discarded like tr\*\*h.  
  
She hung up and took a cab to the Greenwich Village apartment Julian had insisted they get together. Their ""love nest,"" he'd called it. Now, the words mocked her. It was just another stage for his deceptions, another way to control her, to isolate her. The rent was astronomical, paid by Thorne money, of course.  
  
Elara walked through the rooms, a bitter taste in her mouth. She remembered Julian carrying her over the threshold, promising forever. She'd believed him. She'd imagined filling this space with music, with love, with their future. Now, every corner held a phantom, a lie.  
  
She went to the bedroom, her heart a leaden weight. The closet was full of clothes Julian had bought her, dresses for galas, casual wear for weekends in the Hamptons. Gifts. All part of the charade. She pulled out a g\*\*bage bag from under the sink and began to fill it. Every dress, every scarf, every piece of jewelry, every handwritten note professing his undying love. Each item felt like a betrayal, a testament to her own naivety.  
  
The door opened. Julian. He looked surprised to see her there, surrounded by bags.  
  
""Elara? What are you doing? Spring cleaning?"" He smiled, that charming, disarming smile that used to make her heart melt. Now, it was just a mask.  
  
""Getting rid of things I don't need anymore,"" Elara said, her voice devoid of emotion. She continued stuffing a silk blouse into the bag, a blouse he'd said made her eyes sparkle.  
  
He frowned, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. ""You've been distant. Are you still feeling weak from the… donation?""  
  
""I'm fine,"" she said, her tone clipped.  
  
He stepped closer, reaching out to touch her arm. ""We were supposed to go to that new gallery opening tonight. Seraphina's mother is one of the patrons.""  
  
Elara pulled her arm away as if burned. ""I'm not going.""  
  
The easy affection he usually displayed felt like poison now, a calculated move in his long game.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Julian didn't argue. He simply took her arm, his grip surprisingly strong, and steered her towards the door.  
  
""Don't be difficult, Elara. It's important.""  
  
His tone brooked no refusal. Elara went, a cold knot of dread in her stomach. It was easier than fighting, for now.  
  
At the Thorne summer house party in the Hamptons, the air was thick with money and privilege. Seraphina Hayes was there, draped over Julian's arm, her eyes glittering with a possessiveness that Elara had once dismissed as friendship. Seeing them together now, Seraphina's smug smile, Julian's easy intimacy with her, it was like a physical blow. Seraphina met Elara's gaze, a triumphant little smirk playing on her lips. The ""why"" of Julian's cruelty was standing right there, beautiful and vindictive.  
  
Julian quickly excused himself, following Seraphina towards the sprawling gardens, leaving Elara alone by the pool. She felt exposed, vulnerable.  
  
A moment later, Chad and Bryce appeared, smirking.  
  
""Enjoying the party, scholarship girl?"" Chad sneered.  
  
""Julian's busy. Guess you're not his priority tonight,"" Bryce added, his eyes cruel.  
  
They flanked her, backing her towards the edge of the pool. Elara was a poor swimmer, something Julian knew.  
  
""Oops,"" Chad said, ""accidentally"" shoving her.  
  
Elara hit the water with a splash, the cold shocking her. She flailed, gasping, the deep end pulling her down. Panic clawed at her.  
  
Then, strong arms were around her. Julian. He pulled her out, his face a mask of concern.  
  
""Elara! Are you okay?"" He wrapped a towel around her shivering form. ""Clumsy of you.""  
  
She developed a high fever that night. Julian insisted on caring for her, his touch gentle, his voice soothing. He gave her medication, pills he said the doctor prescribed.  
  
""Rest, my love. I'll take care of you.""  
  
But the fever raged on, her body aching, her mind muddled.  
  
Days later, still sick, Elara's phone buzzed. A group text. From Tiffany.  
  
""OMG, Julian, that pool prank was epic! She looked like a drowned rat! And the sugar pills? Genius! Keeping her sick so you can play hero? You're a legend! Seraphina owes you big time!""  
  
Elara's bl\*\*d ran cold. The message was clearly meant for their private group chat, the one that likely detailed all nineteen pranks. Tiffany had sent it to a larger group, one that, by some horrifying oversight, included Elara.  
  
Sugar pills. He hadn't been caring for her. He'd been prolonging her illness, making her suffer more. The realization hit her with the force of a physical blow, leaving her breathless and shaking.

I recently bought a Sage/Breville Bambino along with a Kingrinder K6 hand grinder. It’s been quite a journey, but I finally managed to pull a decent shot of espresso: 17 grams – 28 clicks (-9) – 40 ml – in about 20–30 seconds. I couldn’t grind any finer than that.

Today, I read about grinding horizontally by hand, so I gave it a try. Using the exact same settings and ratio, the shot pulled much faster—around 10–15 seconds—and the coffee tasted creamier, sweeter and less sour. So now I’m experimenting with grinding even finer.

I was using those burrs for around 6-7 months or so, having changed them from the Italmills Stainless. Having a bit of money, I decided to buy the actual SSP HU's and see what the difference between the two are. 

In structure, the SSP HU's have much less aggressive pre-breakers as you can see in the picture (on the left) when compared to the Aliexpress knock offs. The grinding teeth on the knocks offs are smaller than the SSP HU's. The coating feels more sharp and less smooth on the knock offs, like a different material compared to the titanium red speed coating on the HU's 

I grounded 1.5kg of coffee through the SSP HU's to season and have been using them for the better part of a month or so. Straight off the bat, the SSP HU's are definitely the better burrs. They have a nice sweet spot range. Where the knock offs had a higher body / more muddy with way less clarity presumably due to the extra fines, the SSP HU's are able to balance that clarity/body balance really nicely. The knocks off failed in grinding more lighter roasts, and I've been able to grinder lighter roasts on the SSP HU's that work out decently (light-medium roasts). 

The HU's are definitely a nice burrs and a welcome upgrade.

Chapter 1  
  
My boyfriend Rylan was suddenly hospitalized after a car accident.  
  
While classmates rushed to donate money for his treatment, I continued as if nothing had happened.  
  
Eventually, his sister found me at school.  
  
In the classroom, she stood before me with her short-sleeved T-shirt's rolled edges betraying her poor financial situation. She swallowed hard while looking at me, then spoke up amid everyone's confusion.  
  
""Kyra, could you please take out the money my brother's been keeping with you? We need it desperately.""  
  
""Mom has borrowed everything she could, but we're still short... I know my brother has been saving money with you from the beginning.""  
  
I frowned, completely unmoved by her pitiful appearance. ""The money he saved was spent long ago,"" I replied, my expression remaining neutral.  
  
Upon hearing this, the girl's eyes immediately reddened. ""Spent? How is that possible?""  
  
Her voice cracked with shock. ""My brother has been dating you for almost four years since freshman year. Out of his $1,500 monthly allowance, he gives you $1,200, keeping only $300 for food.""  
  
She clutched the edge of my shirt while bending slightly forward, her eyes brimming with tears. ""Not to mention all the part-time jobs he takes—all that money goes into your shared savings too. That should add up to tens of thousands! How could it all be gone?!""  
  
""He's gone hungry several times with no money for food and had to borrow from me. He even asked me not to tell our parents, which is how I found out about this.""  
  
With her grip tightening on my shirt, she pleaded, ""Please, I know this isn't right, and I didn't get my brother's permission, but as his girlfriend, can't you help instead of leaving him to die?""  
  
A deafening silence fell across the room until someone finally broke it.  
  
""Wait... I thought Rylan was a scholarship student! Turns out his monthly allowance isn't small at all!"" exclaimed one classmate while others quickly joined in.  
  
""Yeah, he's always been so frugal... I used to think Kyra wasn't materialistic like other girls... so all of Rylan's money has been going to her?""  
  
Someone else added with disbelief, ""I always thought Kyra came from a wealthy family. So she's been splurging with money Rylan saved by skimping on food?!""  
  
As surprised and accusatory voices rose around us, I frowned at the crowd. ""You're all making judgments based on one side of the story. What gives you the right to speculate about me?"" I turned back to the girl with a cold stare. ""I told you your brother doesn't have any money with me. Stop making a scene. Everyone has their own fate,"" I stated, my voice remaining cold and flat.  
  
The moment I finished speaking, slow, deliberate clapping cut through the tension. Rylan's roommate, Dax, stood up with his hands coming together in sarcastic applause, his face twisted with contempt.  
  
""'Everyone has their own fate.' What a line,"" he sneered while stepping forward.  
  
""Others might not know, but as his roommate, how could I not? I've seen with my own eyes how Rylan's first action every month after receiving his allowance is to transfer money—to you, apparently?""  
  
His eyes narrowed as he gestured toward my outfit. ""Look at the clothes and shoes you're wearing—all luxury brands. And Rylan? He buys $9.99 clothes with free shipping and wears his shoes until they fall apart!""  
  
His voice rose with each word as his anger became more apparent. ""Now that he's in trouble and needs money, you're pretending there's no connection? Do you think we're all idiots?""  
  
Dax's words hit like a sledgehammer, leaving everyone stunned.  
  
Unlike the girl, he was our class representative—always responsible, serious, and gentle with others. No one had ever seen him angry before, yet now his eyes were wide with fury as he delivered the final blow: ""Do you know Rylan got into that car accident while rushing to a part-time job to earn money for your birthday gift?!""  
  
Hearing this revelation, the classmates who had been wavering now fully believed him.  
  
""Damn, I never thought Kyra was this type of person.""  
  
""How can she live with herself? Shouldn't couples split costs? She's just greedy!""  
  
Facing everyone's accusations, I simply smirked and walked away from the noisy classroom, completely unfazed by their judgment.  
  
Little did I know that within the hour, my phone would be flooded with messages.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Among the stream of vile messages lighting up my screen, I first noticed one from a friend at our university.  
  
""Kyra, you should check out... the Campus Forum. What's going on there?"" The message stood out because this friend normally never cared about campus gossip, so the fact she was directing me to the Campus Forum meant this had blown up significantly.  
  
After opening my social media, I quickly scrolled until finding the viral post that had captured everyone's attention:  
  
""We are Kyra's roommates, and at the request of those involved, we've taken these photos (attached).""  
  
""We're extremely reluctant to believe our roommate is such a heartless and greedy person.""  
  
Below the text was nine photos showing various branded bags and expensive gifts, each appearing quite valuable. They had specifically marked out one item with a detailed caption: ""This bear pendant—we checked—is smaller than a fist but costs $800, and Kyra has FIVE of them.""  
  
The post continued with damning accusations: ""As far as we know, Kyra's family isn't wealthy. Where she got the money for these luxury items is obvious. We only learned the truth today—Rylan wanted to save money with you out of love, and this is how you treat your joint savings? Especially now when he's in danger, you turn a blind eye. We're exposing all this today, and we no longer want to be your roommates.""  
  
The post had already sparked intense discussion, and now, with my roommate explaining the ins and outs, it has further ignited my classmates' anger.  
  
""Damn, this girl is so selfish!""  
  
""This proves couples should never mix finances.""  
  
""God, how could he do this to himself? That guy is so skinny, yet she spends money so frivolously, like a parasite...""  
  
""Terrifying. I'm afraid to date now—scared of being treated like an ATM.""  
  
Some took the opportunity to make broader generalizations: ""Women have it so easy making money. If I were a woman dating ten guys, I'd be loaded.""  
  
""Money for $800 charms and thousand-dollar bags, but none for her boyfriend's medical bills? A woman drowning in vanity.""  
  
Yet compared to my private messages, the comments section was actually tame—merely sharp criticisms rather than the truly disgusting messages flooding my inbox.  
  
There, people who didn’t know the full story hurled insults at me indiscriminately, especially the guys who put themselves in Rylan’s shoes. Even though they had never gone through anything like this themselves, they now banded together, full of righteous indignation.  
  
With a heavy sigh, I finally returned to my dorm, only to find my clothes and bags thrown on the floor and covered in dust. Several of my sheer dresses had new holes, and my bags displayed obvious scratch marks across their surfaces.  
  
Meanwhile, my three roommates sat inside, busily engaged with their phones and makeup, deliberately acting as if I didn't exist.  
  
As I surveyed the damage to my belongings, my expression darkened: ""You're damaging someone else's property. I can call 911.""  
  
Without even turning her head, Lisa continued applying her makeup, admiring herself in the mirror from different angles. ""Go ahead, call them,"" she sneered while blending her eyeshadow. ""While you're at it, why don't you explain exactly where these things came from and whose money bought them? Let's see who ends up paying compensation—us or you.""  
  
Her voice dripped with contempt, without a trace of guilt or hesitation.  
  
Another roommate immediately chimed in, crossing her legs dramatically as she lounged on her bed. ""Hmph, now I understand how you afford showing off new things every day—you're spending someone else's hard-earned money. No wonder you treat everything so carelessly,"" she remarked with a mocking smile.  
  
The third roommate didn't even bother acknowledging my presence, completely ignoring the confrontation.  
  
Seeing their completely unbothered attitudes, I stopped arguing and instead walked directly to their closets, throwing the doors open with purpose.  
  
Without hesitation, I grabbed a pair of scissors and began cutting through their clothes methodically.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
One garment, then another... I continued until the room was in complete disarray, only then did they finally notice what I was doing.  
  
""What the fuck! Are you insane? What do you think you're doing?"" one screamed, jumping up from her chair.  
  
Another rushed toward her damaged belongings, her face contorting with rage. ""What gives you the right to touch my stuff?! This skirt took an entire month of saving to buy! You're going to pay for this!!!""  
  
""Holy shit, that was from my idol's brand collection!"" the third shrieked, lunging forward. ""I paid a fortune for that!! You absolute bitch!!""  
  
As they all clawed their way toward me, I spun around and darted out of the dorm, quickly locking the door from the outside before they could reach me.  
  
With my dorm now off-limits, I headed straight to a hotel near campus.  
  
Predictably, within hours, I received a call from our academic advisor summoning me to her office.  
  
When I arrived, I immediately spotted my three roommates huddled together in the corner, their faces transforming into masks of accusation the moment they saw me enter.  
  
The advisor tapped her fingers lightly on the desk while taking a slow sip of coffee. Her narrowed eyes scrutinized me from behind thin glasses, judgment evident in her gaze.  
  
""Kyra, correct? I know who you are,"" she began with an air of superiority. ""The computer science student who's always dressed up—hard to forget, really.""  
  
She placed her cup down deliberately before continuing, ""You should understand that students come to university to learn, not to compete with each other, and certainly not to indulge in vanity.""  
  
Gesturing toward my roommates, she continued, ""Regarding the damage to your roommates' personal property, they've each recorded their losses in detail. If you refuse to compensate them, I have no choice but to issue a major demerit on your permanent record.""  
  
Her voice hardened as she added, ""This will affect your graduate school recommendations and all special considerations.""  
  
""As for the scandal that's been circulating recently, I've heard about it. While we shouldn't jump to conclusions, I must remind you that you can't take advantage of someone's affection to do whatever you please.""  
  
She leaned forward, her tone becoming increasingly condescending. ""Beauty isn't capital—kindness and consideration for others are the virtues a young woman should possess. That boy treated you so well, yet you behave like this? Truly disappointing.""  
  
""No wonder more people criticize today's young women. People like you deserve the criticism.""  
  
Her words penetrated the empty office, each syllable drilling into my ears.  
  
I pressed my lips together before responding, ""So you believe whatever they say without question?""  
  
Meeting her gaze directly, I continued, ""As a teacher, shouldn't you at least uphold fairness? If this is just their one-sided story, then go ahead and punish me however you see fit. Why even bother calling me here?""  
  
The advisor couldn't tolerate my defiance. Her cup landed heavily on the desk with a dull thud.  
  
""You think you're so wealthy?"" she snapped. ""Then I'm giving you a deadline to compensate for the damages AND return the money Rylan entrusted to you. Otherwise, I'll contact your parents to settle this matter.""  
  
""We have your parents' contact information on file. If you won't behave responsibly, we'll have to involve those who will.""  
  
Despite her seated position, years of authority had perfected her condescending glare.  
  
But I maintained my composure, responding flatly, ""Go ahead and call them if you want.""  
  
The advisor stared me down, her voice eerily calm. ""Let me emphasize again—this demerit will definitely affect your graduate school candidacy. Our university doesn't accept students with questionable character into our graduate programs.""  
  
Hearing this, a heaviness settled in my chest. They were the ones who refused to investigate, who jumped to conclusions. Since this situation began, no one cared about the truth—everyone simply believed rumors without question.  
  
I never expected teachers would behave this way too.  
  
Lowering my eyes, I replied quietly, ""Fine. Let it affect my chances, then."" And I walked toward the door.  
  
If all my hard work could be erased so easily, then perhaps I didn't want that spot anyway!

The Temple Between Time – Chapter 6 Snippet

The Sunday sun was bright, but not cruel. A soft golden haze washed over Mumbai like a warm welcome. The streets buzzed with energy—vendors shouting, rickshaws honking, a thousand scents dancing in the air.

Devyani stood at the edge of the Bandra Fort overlook, wind to her face, eyes scanning the Arabian Sea below. The salty breeze tugged at the ends of her braid, strands of hair escaping like whispers of another time.

She was wearing jeans.

It still felt strange—tight, restrictive—but she’d allowed Rhea to convince her that “leggings were not a full personality,” and now here she stood, in modern clothes, looking anything but ordinary.

“Devs, you have to taste this!” Dheeraj called, waving a cone of bhel puri like it was a royal dish. “It’s spicy chaos. Just like me.”

“Don’t listen to him,” Naina said, snatching the cone and tasting it first. “He once called toothpaste ‘mint curry’.”

“Once!” Dheeraj defended. “And it was minty.”

Parth stood beside Devyani, a safe distance but close enough that she could feel the calm of his presence. He wasn’t laughing like the others. Just… watching the sea with her.

“You’ve been quiet,” he said gently.

“I am taking it in.”

He nodded. “It’s a lot.”

She turned to him. “Do you not find this world… overwhelming?”

Parth smiled softly. “All the time. But you learn to find silence in small things. Like watching the waves. Or sharing pani puri with friends. Or listening to someone try masala Coke for the first time and make a royal gag face.”

She chuckled under her breath. “It was vile.”

He looked at her, not with amusement—but admiration. “You’re doing great, you know.”

Her expression shifted slightly. “Great?”

“I mean it. I can’t imagine waking up one day and being dropped into a world where nothing makes sense. And yet… you carry yourself like you belong here. Even when you don’t understand something, you don’t run from it.”

“I do not run,” she said quietly. “Not anymore.”

Their eyes held.

A moment.

A beat.

Then—

“GUYS!” Rhea shouted. “Group photo time!”

They were dragged into a messy, lopsided selfie in front of the sea. Devyani stood between Rhea and Parth, and at the last second, Parth's hand found her shoulder—gentle, steady. She stiffened for half a second... then didn’t move away.

“The Man at the Mall” — Chapter Snippet

The mall was a sensory storm—flashing lights, pop music, the scent of caramel popcorn and overpriced perfume. Devyani walked slowly, gaze darting between the escalators and the mannequins in glittering windows.

She still wasn’t used to this much noise. This much motion.

“Try not to look like you just got summoned from a time portal,” Rhea teased gently, holding up a sequined top. “You’re killing the ‘normal college girl’ vibe.”

“I do not believe I have ever been normal,” Devyani murmured, half to herself.

A laugh bubbled from Naina, who had just returned with iced coffee for everyone. “You’re doing better than half the girls I know.”

But Devyani’s attention was already drifting. Something shimmered in her peripheral vision—an odd flicker on the glass banister lining the upper floor. She blinked.

And misstepped.

Her foot slipped just as she reached the top of the wide staircase—one polished sole catching on the metal edge.

She felt her balance falter, gravity shift—heart rising into her throat.

And then—

Strong arms caught her.

They weren’t Parth’s.

The man was tall—older, mid-to-late twenties—dressed in a crisp navy shirt, sharp features and dark eyes that didn’t match his warm smile.

“Whoa,” he said, steadying her by the waist. “Careful there.”

She looked up, startled.

He didn’t let go right away.

“You alright?”

She nodded slowly. “Yes. I... I am fine.”

“Good,” he said, eyes scanning her face with something more than politeness. “You look a little out of place. First week in the city?”

She hesitated.

“I... suppose so.”

“I’m Raj,” he said, offering a hand. “What’s your name?”

Her lips parted.

And then—

“Devyani!”
Parth’s voice—low, firm, unmistakable.

He appeared beside her in a heartbeat, gaze flicking from the man’s hand on her waist to Devyani’s pale face. He stepped in immediately, sliding between them with practiced ease.

“She’s with me,” Parth said sharply.

Raj lifted both hands, eyebrows raised. “Whoa, chill. She was about to fall. I helped.”

Parth’s eyes narrowed. “And now you can let go.”

Raj’s jaw twitched—but he obeyed.

Devyani took a half-step back, catching her breath.

“Thank you,” she said softly. “But I’m alright now.”

The man gave her a nod—more calculated than kind—and turned to walk away. But not before glancing once over his shoulder.

And holding her gaze a second too long.

---

Next Stop: Colaba Causeway

The group weaved through stalls stacked with jewelry, shawls, incense holders, and journals that looked centuries old.

Devyani’s fingers brushed over a brass coin necklace.

“Want it?” Parth asked.

She shook her head. “I have no money.”

He stepped forward, handed the vendor a note, and gave it to her.

Devyani looked stunned. “You did not need to—”

“I wanted to.”

She stared at him, the necklace warm in her palm.

“Why?” she asked.

Parth thought for a second. “Because you looked at it like it meant something.”

---

Sunset: Marine Drive

The sky blushed with streaks of orange and rose as they sat along the Queen’s Necklace. Waves lapped the rocks below. Laughter echoed faintly around them.

Dheeraj and Naina were bickering again. Rhea was typing something furiously into her Notes app—“story idea,” she muttered.

Parth and Devyani sat quietly, shoulders brushing, as the sun dipped lower.

“Does your world have this?” he asked, pointing at the sunset.

“We had sun,” she said, smiling faintly. “But not like this. There was always war looming, or politics clouding peace. I never sat like this. Just… watching.”

“Well,” he said, “now you have this.”

She turned to him, the light catching her eyes just right.

“Why do you do this?” she asked.

“What?”

“Care so much. Protect me. Help me. I am not easy.”

“No,” he said quietly. “You’re not easy. You’re brave. And stubborn. And brilliant. And you deserve to feel safe.”

She blinked.

Slowly, she lowered her head, resting it lightly on his shoulder. She didn’t even know she’d done it until she felt his breath catch. He didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

Just sat there.

The silence between them—rich, real—spoke more than words.

And as the last sliver of sun disappeared below the sea, Princess Devyani of the Mauryan Empire… finally exhaled.

“The Obsession Begins” — Stalking Devyani

The night draped over Mumbai like velvet soaked in secrets.

High above the noise and color of the city, in the quiet, gated grandeur of Malabar Hill, stood a bungalow that could pass for a palace—walls lined with silver-gold decor, a sprawling balcony that overlooked the sea, and a garden groomed down to each leaf’s curve.

Inside, all was silence.

Except for the soft rustle of a photograph.

Raj sat in a high-backed leather chair inside his dim study, bathed in the warm glow of a single table lamp. The photo in his hand was still crisp—fresh from the printer.

In it, Devyani stood near a mannequin at the mall, completely unaware. Her posture regal, yet uncertain. Her eyes trained curiously on a necklace. Her expression—strangely timeless.

Raj traced the edge of the photo with his thumb like it was made of silk.

Behind him, a man entered—lean, suited, and silent.

Raj didn’t look up.

“She’s not like the others,” he said softly. “There’s something about her. The way she walks. The way she speaks. Like she doesn’t belong here.”

He finally turned, handing the photo over.

“Find everything,” Raj said, his tone clipped, controlled. “Where she lives. Who she stays with. What her routine is. Her name. Her real name.”

The man nodded once and left without a word.

Raj leaned back in his chair, exhaling slowly. Then stood. Walked toward the floor-to-ceiling window.

The city blinked below—oblivious.

He held his whiskey glass loosely in one hand. The ice clinked softly.

“She’s different,” he murmured, to no one.

A pause.

Then, darker—possessive.

“Never knew someone could be this gorgeous…”

He turned back to the photo lying on his desk.

“…but now I’m not letting anyone even see you. Not him. Not anyone.”

He picked it up again, fingers curling tighter.

“Soon… you’ll be mine.”

The wedding ceremony had reached the ring exchange when suddenly the banquet hall's giant screen displayed HD footage of me being kidnapped and brutalized.  
  
My fiancé, Reed Grimm, immediately called off the wedding, turning to slide the ring onto my bestie's finger instead.  
  
I collapsed on the red carpet amid a chorus of disgusted whispers and outright abuse from the guests.  
  
That's when Kieran Reeves, my bestie's brother, the mob boss, caught me before I hit the ground. He silenced the room with a single gunshot into the air, then ordered his men to bring in ten cases of gold as a bride price before proposing to me right there.  
  
In my emotional state, I accepted.  
  
Three years later, our IVF treatment had finally succeeded. As I rushed to share the good news with Kieran, I overheard him talking with his homie.  
  
""Boss, that was brilliant—showing that footage of Dakota being assaulted at the wedding so Peyton could marry into the Grimm family instead.""  
  
Kieran flicked his lighter casually. ""The Grimms would never accept a woman with a stain on her reputation. Dakota had to be ruined so Peyton could become the legitimate Grimm bride.""  
  
His friend asked, puzzled: ""But hey, Peyton already landed her Grimm marriage. Why the hell would you tie yourself down to damaged goods?""  
  
""Peyton hates pain. Dakota's womb is the perfect surrogate to give her a child. Once she delivers the Grimm heir, Peyton's position will be even more secure.""  
  
The uproarious laughter that followed froze my blood. Every supposedly happy moment of the past three years had just been Kieran's elaborate con to squeeze every last drop of value from me, all so Peyton could climb to her throne by stepping over my broken body.  
  
I wiped away my tears and dialed the number of Kieran's rival crime boss. ""I have a ten-million-dollar job. Interested?""  
  
\---  
  
The mocking conversation continued in the private room.  
  
""Damn, Kieran, you're a genius—swapping her vitamins with abortion pills so she couldn't get pregnant naturally. If she ever knew that IVF embryo got switched with Peyton and Reed's baby ages ago, she'd totally lose her shit!""  
  
""Whether she loses it or not isn't my problem. After she delivers, I'll just make up some excuse about the baby dying. She'll only blame herself for not being able to keep a child. Being useful to Peyton's happiness is more than that waste of space deserves.""  
  
Kieran tossed his lighter onto the table and stood, warning everyone present: ""Not a single word of this conversation leaves this room. I need her to carry this pregnancy to term without making trouble.""  
  
Liam, his homie, pounded his chest proudly. ""No worries, boss. That woman's dumb as rocks. We call her 'ma'am' and she actually thinks she's your queen—bringing us food and drinks daily. She has no clue that I personally handpicked every single guy who filmed her assault.""  
  
Someone laughed crudely. ""Liam, you bastard, why didn't you pick me? I wanted a taste…""  
  
A fruit knife suddenly flew across the room, embedding itself in the floor between the man's legs. The joker's face turned ashen with fear.  
  
""Haven't I fucking said it already? Dakota's my wife now. Anyone who brings up that shit again, I'll personally destroy them.""  
  
One of his men awkwardly mumbled, ""Boss, seems to me you actually do have feelings for her. And that woman's crazy in love with you. Aren't you worried she'll bail when she finds out the truth someday?""  
  
Kieran scoffed dismissively, ""Worst case, I'll just give her another IVF baby and support her for life. She's damaged goods with a pathetic romantic brain—throw her a couple sweet lines and she'll be back licking my boots like a trained dog.""  
  
The room erupted in laughter as I stood frozen outside the door, silently swallowing my sobs.  
  
Footsteps approached, and I hurried downstairs, grabbing a strong drink at the bar. I downed it in one go, the burning alcohol finally allowing my tears to flow freely.  
  
I clutched my chest as their cruel words echoed in my mind.  
  
One week before our wedding, I'd been kidnapped and subjected to unimaginable horror for twenty-four hours. Reed had held my hand afterward, swearing he still loved me and would marry me regardless.  
  
But my joyful anticipation of our wedding day ended when that footage appeared. Reed's second abandonment left me branded as a whore, condemned by everyone in attendance. Kieran had burst in, shooting out the screen, holding me close, and fiercely driving back everyone's judgment and abuse.  
  
He'd had gold brought for me, saying he'd loved me forever and would die with regret if he couldn't make me his wife. Those determined eyes had won me over, but now he revealed it was all to pave Peyton's way.  
  
No wonder Peyton had given me that strange smile at the wedding. I'd been kidnapped after she claimed her car had broken down and needed my help.  
  
She'd known all along this was Kieran's plot. She'd been laughing at my stupidity while delighting in having such a devoted backup plan.  
  
And these three years of care and love were just Kieran's performance to extract my last bit of value.  
  
But I'd mistaken my executioner for my savior. How laughable!  
  
My fingernails dug into my palms as I clenched my teeth, pain and hatred churning in my chest while tears flowed uncontrollably.  
  
A familiar presence descended behind me as Kieran kissed my temple, his brow furrowing with concern as he publicly berated the room: ""Which worthless bastard made my wife cry? I'll put a bullet in them myself.""  
  
The room fell silent, everyone too terrified to breathe.  
  
Kieran pulled his gun from his waistband and placed it in my hands, wrapping his arms around me and guiding my aim across the crowd. ""Baby, shoot whoever looks at you wrong. I'll take the heat.""  
  
The men trembled violently as the gun swept past them, but none dared move.  
  
In Vistania, Kieran led one of the country's two major crime syndicates. Nobody crossed him.  
  
When the gun settled on Liam's head, I paused. Liam's eyes bulged as the blood drained from his face.  
  
The words ""I personally handpicked every single guy who filmed her assault"" screamed in my head.  
  
My chest heaved as I was about to pull the trigger, but Kieran pushed the gun down.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Darling, the doctor says the IVF worked. Better not see blood now—it might upset the baby.""  
  
He soothed me tenderly, his eyes showing concern that seemed impossible to fake.  
  
I almost wanted to applaud his masterful acting.  
  
Noticing my unusual mood, Kieran spotted the drink in front of me. He squeezed my palm gently and asked, ""Darling, how long have you been down here? Why didn't you come find me upstairs?"" His casual words barely concealed his cautious probing.  
  
I lowered my eyes and replied flatly, ""You men discussing business with all that smoke and noise—I don't like it.""  
  
He sighed with relief as he stroked my head, then had a housekeeper bring over some tea. The moment she extended her hand, Kieran suddenly raised his gun and blew her head off.  
  
I couldn't even react before thick blood splattered across my face. The housekeeper's outstretched hand remained frozen in place as she toppled over, eyes wide with shock.  
  
I trembled uncontrollably, my lips quivering as my stomach cramped violently. Yet Kieran acted as if nothing had happened, calmly wiping my face clean with his sleeve before lifting the tea to my lips, feeding me sip by sip.  
  
I swallowed mechanically, my entire body shaking.  
  
From the corner of my eye, I saw Liam have the housekeeper's body dragged away, leaving a winding trail of blood across the floor.  
  
""She couldn't even keep an eye on my wife drinking alcohol—that's endangering my son. She didn't deserve to live,"" Kieran stated coldly.  
  
I stared at his vicious expression, my stomach churning.  
  
Kieran stroked my face tenderly. ""It's my fault, baby. I've let you suffer too much. Now that we finally have our baby, you can't touch alcohol again. This child must be born healthy, no matter what, got it?""  
  
I took several deep breaths before forcing a dry laugh. ""Okay.""  
  
But my heart was freezing.  
  
Three years' marriage, I'd been pregnant six times, each ending in unexplained miscarriage. After so many losses, the doctors diagnosed habitual miscarriage. Six months ago, they told me I could never conceive again.  
  
Kieran had held me close, saying he didn't care about having children as long as I was happy and healthy.  
  
I had always felt guilty about not giving him a healthy child, and after extensive research, I chose the difficult IVF route—my belly was riddled with needle marks, and I'd taken handfuls of hormone medications. All that suffering, only to discover it was to make Peyton's path easier.  
  
Just because she said she ""feared pain,"" I would forever lose my chance at motherhood, reduced to being merely a breeding vessel.  
  
""What's wrong? You look awful. Are you feeling sick? I'll call the doctor right away.""  
  
""I'm fine, just some morning sickness,"" I replied.  
  
Kieran's eyes reddened with concern as he caressed my face. ""Darling, I wish I could bear this for you. Our wedding was so rushed—I've ordered your favorite imported wedding dress. Before your belly grows, I'll take you to try it on tomorrow.""  
  
I stared at him steadily. Such sincere eyes, yet he'd treated me like a fool, deceiving me again and again.  
  
If he knew I had no intention of carrying this child to term, I'd likely end up like that housekeeper.  
  
I forced a smile. ""I'll go rest. You men continue your talk.""  
  
Back in our bedroom, I immediately rushed to the bathroom, vomiting until my stomach was knotted in pain. Tears streamed down my face, the physical pain nothing compared to the agony in my heart.  
  
After recovering somewhat, I emerged to find Kieran's phone forgotten on the coffee table.  
  
Some inexplicable impulse made me pick it up. I tried Peyton's birthday once, and it unlocked. The screen wallpaper showed Peyton leaning on his shoulder, smiling radiantly.  
  
I scrolled through his photo gallery—over five thousand images, each featuring Peyton.  
  
He'd organized them into four folders, documenting different periods of Peyton's life. The folder labels formed the phrase ""My Only Love Forever.""  
  
Their message history revealed Kieran had once risked his life to steal the Vistanian royal crown. All because Peyton had casually mentioned wanting to feel like a queen on her 25th birthday.  
  
I suddenly remembered that day—he'd taken two bullets and nearly died. I'd traded my mother's only heirloom, an invaluable ancient amulet, to retrieve him from the royal security forces.  
  
Tears fell onto the screen as my heart twisted in pain. Not from the years of deception, but because I'd sacrificed my mother's only memento for this monster who'd destroyed me.  
  
Through tear-blurred vision, I noticed the crescent-shaped birthmark on Peyton's right shoulder and gasped in shock.  
  
I had an identical birthmark in exactly the same place on my right shoulder.  
  
I remembered when I first met Peyton, she hadn't had that birthmark.  
  
After I told her about saving a bloodied man while working as the MSF in Vistania, she began distancing herself from me.  
  
Shortly after, she became Kieran's ""adopted sister,"" and Kieran claimed Peyton had once saved his life.  
  
But Peyton was a coward who feared death—she'd never visited conflict-prone Vistania and constantly disparaged the country.  
  
My cold fingers curled as an outrageous guess began forming in my mind.  
  
So that was it!  
  
I collapsed to the floor, caught between tears and laughter.  
  
After composing myself, I wiped away my tears, took out my phone, and dialed an unfamiliar number.  
  
""I have a ten-million-dollar job. Interested?""  
  
""What's the job?""  
  
""Three days later, kidnap me.""  
  
I gently touched my belly. ""Kieran will pay the ransom willingly.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Just as I hung up, Kieran pushed open the door.  
  
He'd been drinking heavily and stumbled slightly, but his wariness never faltered as he grasped my hand. ""What will I pay willingly?""  
  
Without missing a beat, I answered, ""I saw a necklace. The seller wants a deposit.""  
  
He laughed, resting his head on my shoulder. ""Fine, I'll pay. I'll pay for anything. Peyton, whatever you want, I will give you, even myself.""  
  
I kept my face expressionless as I helped him to bed and tucked him in, then lay beside him with open eyes all night.  
  
The next day, halfway to the bridal shop, Kieran received a call and explained anxiously, ""Babe, a shipment's been intercepted. I need to handle it now.""  
  
He clasped my hand apologetically. ""I'm sorry, I promise to take you tomorrow. I've also ordered matching 'Only You Forever' rings for us to try on. Okay?""  
  
I withdrew my hand. ""I understand. Go ahead. I'll wait for you at home.""  
  
He squeezed my hand once more before driving away.  
  
Less than ten minutes later, Liam's car arrived.  
  
As soon as I got in, a photo of Peyton came through on my phone—she wore a dazzling diamond ring and the imported wedding dress I'd been eyeing, kneeling on a man's lap. One of his large hands rested on her thigh through the thin material as he kissed the crescent birthmark on her right shoulder, his eyes dark with desire.  
  
A voice message followed: ""I can only get through each night by imagining you while I'm with her. Peyton, my sweet Peyton, brother misses you so much. Please comfort me."" The husky voice was followed by suppressed breathing.  
  
In the silent car, Liam's snicker broke the quiet.  
  
I startled, only then realizing we weren't heading home.  
  
""Liam, I'm Kieran's wife! What are you doing?""  
  
The car suddenly stopped. I immediately reached for the other door, but he moved faster, grabbing my ankle and dragging me out. Pain blackened my vision.  
  
I gritted my teeth, glaring at him fiercely. ""I'm carrying Kieran's child. If anything happens to me, you won't survive either.""  
  
""You idiot. Did you really think Kieran would let a filthy woman like you carry his child?"" came a shrill voice from behind. I realized we were in an alley not far from the bridal shop.  
  
Peyton stepped on my face, her eyes and brows filled with delighted laughter.  
  
Liam walked over and wrapped his arm around her waist, kneading her flesh roughly. To my shock, they passionately kissed before Liam finally spoke: ""You heard us at the door, right? Too bad—the embryo isn't even Peyton's. I just found some homeless beggar's sperm to switch it with.""  
  
I jerked my head up, my pupils trembling.  
  
Peyton laughed hysterically. ""Oh my God, you're truly filthy inside and out now—carrying a beggar's baby like some red-light district whore. Dakota, what's the difference between you and a streetwalker? At least they get paid. You're paying to birth a bastard! Is one enough? Should we put a whole litter in you? Like a breeding sow, hahaha!""  
  
My brain exploded with fury, the metallic taste of blood rising in my throat. I roared with rage, grabbing a rock from the ground, determined to take these two monsters down with me.  
  
Liam kicked my belly, sending me sprawling as I vomited blood, my face ashen with pain.  
  
Peyton suddenly backed away in terror, pretending to stumble and fall.  
  
Though she hadn't been touched, Kieran came running and stepped over my hand to embrace her, his eyes filled with obvious concern: ""Peyton, are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?""  
  
Peyton whimpered delicately, her eyes filled with unshed tears as she looked at me. ""Dakota, I know I've wronged you. I just wanted to apologize properly and wish you and my brother happiness. Why would you hurt me like this? You know I'm newly pregnant. Even if you hate me, the baby is innocent.""  
  
She clutched Kieran's hand and whispered softly as he watched in surprise: ""Kieran, this baby is...""  
  
She lowered her eyes shyly, leaving the implication clear.  
  
Unexpectedly, Kieran didn't seem as excited as anticipated. He just stared at her with an unreadable expression.  
  
Liam indignantly spoke up: ""Boss, your wife used her pregnancy as leverage, called Miss Peyton a whore bearing a bastard, said she was like a breeding sow who'd keep producing bastards.""  
  
""She tried to hit Miss Peyton with a rock. When I stopped her, she threatened me with her baby, saying you'd kill me if I harmed her child. I can take the abuse, but Miss Peyton is too kind-hearted to be treated this way!""  
  
Kieran turned to look at me, the crimson rage in his eyes telling me no matter what explanation I offered, he wouldn't believe it.  
  
""Dakota, Peyton saved my life. Haven't I made it clear that anyone who touches her answers to me? Even if you're my wife carrying my child, that doesn't give you a free pass!""  
  
Carrying his child? I struggled to my feet, laughing bitterly. ""Kieran, tell me the truth. Is this really your child I'm carrying?""  
  
Kieran's expression faltered momentarily. After a flash of panic, he turned the accusation back on me.  
  
""Whose else would you want it to be? Liam, take her home and lock her up. Nobody releases her without my direct order.""  
  
With that, he carried Peyton away without a backward glance.  
  
Liam crouched before me, holding two sharp steel spikes with a sinister smile. ""Ever seen our gang's bone breakers? Just one of these, and your foot is permanently ruined. You'll spend the rest of your life crawling like a dog.""  
  
I stared in terror as he pinned my foot down and drove both spikes through my ankle. The pain was unbearable. I screamed until darkness claimed me.  
  
When I regained consciousness two days later, my phone was filled with Peyton's flaunting Instagram posts—there was Kieran as I'd never seen him in our three years together—cooking for a woman, washing her feet, braiding her hair, feeding her bite by bite, showering her with gifts that filled the entire backdrop. They visited amusement parks, shared pastries, their eyes dripping with affection…  
  
I swallowed my tears and painfully dragged my agonizing legs to the drawer where I'd prepared divorce papers. I placed them in plain sight along with my eight-year-old injury report from when I'd saved someone in Vistania, plus a voice recorder.  
  
I struggled to climb out the window. The waves crashed below the villa, and a small, inconspicuous boat had drawn near.  
  
On my phone, Kieran's message appeared: ""Ready to apologize? If you kneel and ask Peyton's forgiveness, she'll pardon you. I've already pleaded your case. Be good, don't make this difficult for me.""  
  
I replied: ""My greatest mistake was saving a black-clad man with eight stab wounds at Vistania's harbor that night eight years ago.""  
  
I tossed the phone aside and jumped into the sea.

So me and this girl have been friends for three years since moving to college. 4 girls always stuck together. We all went to a community college and plans were after two years we transfer to the local university. Well. Two of them from LA (let’s call them Lauren and Kathy) and one is from inland of that (Morgan) so. All was well the first year ish. Lauren was obviously boy crazy but it was whatever, we were freshman in college. Then I quickly realized most house issues were revolved around Lauren. Kathy is my BEST friend now but she went to HS with Lauren but treated Kathy like SHIT. Like purposely left her out blah blah. Fast forward two years and now we’re here. Morgan got her AA and is moving in with her boyfriend to do hair. Things have been HORRIBLE with Lauren. 
I’ve always been a really forgiving person. But I’m a cunt when needed, I don’t mind sticking up for myself and others. Lauren stopped doing things around the house, less than she was freshman year. As years went on it was just worse and worse and Kathy always did everything for her. She’s a people pleaser. I also realized Lauren is a pathological liar. I’m now at the university and Kathy isn’t yet there nor is Lauren. But Lauren takes her friends uni pi phi sweatshirts, tells everyone she goes there, etc. on top of this I really stopped giving a shit when she left me alone at a bar and told me to wait for 30 min while she went somewhere else. She is always the victim in her story too and everyone around her for some reason enables it. Also dishes were constantly left everywhere even when everyone asked her to clean them. Left EVERYTHING everywhere. Her guy friends were dicks, litterally took my bike and it’s forever gone becuase they lost it. Talks shit on every one of her friends, etc. overall just the worst person I’ve possibly met.

Anyways, now we’re coming on the re-lease time. I’m leaving for a few months next quarter so I was like whatever I guess I’ll just bare through it becuase honestly I didn’t want to step on any toes and was over it. Well, Lauren is left with her dishes to do and Morgan asks her to do them before she leaves for a trip (she’s left them many times before) she scattered them around the house as if we’re fucking idiots and said she did them and left. So, Morgan took up my joke of leaving them on her bed… so she came back three days later and lost it. Said nothing. Chucked all the plates in the backyard etc. left the house for a day and texted us she’s terminating her lease. Boy oh boy you couldn’t even imagine how fast I went to go find a new roomate. I found two (Lauren’s place and Morgan’s place) PERFECT girls and met them and everything. Lauren sent us a paper we needed to sign to terminate her and approve her for the rent and I signed and sent it to Kathy and she was on a long trip so didn’t get to it. Two weeks pass and Lauren changed her mind. She had earlier found her friends place to live in for $ 1100 but changed her mind becuase she THOUGHT the other room here was cheaper. It’s not (1250) and she’s always talking about how her mom can’t afford to pay for anywhere else. (Also maybe a lie). THEN GO HOME YOUR ABOUT TO BE A SENIOR IN COLLEGE EQUAL TO A FRESHMAN WITH NO CREDITS BECUASE YOU DONT EVER DO SCHOOL YOU JUST FUCK MEN AND LIE ALL DAMN DAY. Anyways, she texts me and says (we haven’t spoken in weeks) hey, is there still a spot open. I said no sorry the other girls signed the lease (we were supposed to go in the next day) she responded while I let out the biggest heave I’ve ever hooved “you never signed the terminating paper”. When I tell u I got my ass up SO fast and went to the leasing office for them to print it out. 10 min later… she’s there. FOLLOWED ME. It’s closed for lunch. I go to a coffee shop and wait it out, she does the same outside of the office. She goes in first and SIGNED A LEASE WITH ME KATHY HER AND ONE OF THE GIRLS I FOUND THAT SHE HAD NEVER MET. So I try telling the receptionist becuase our landlord isn’t there. Now, we are a week past and I’m too to go in tomorrow to try and rationalize with him. (He emailed me saying that if I never signed the terminating lease then she’s technically still on it). Kathy is on my side too keep in mind. So now I have four girls to fill this house. If one of these girls leaves in order for Lauren to take her spot, the other will too. So we will have two missing spots to try and fill (nobody is looking for housing anymore) by the end of this month. Or I’m gonna terminate the lease and have Lauren sign off on it and then ask my landlord if we could apply for the house separately considering she has no roomates to offer. I can NOT let this girl win. If anyone has advice before tomorrow at two HELP. But more importantly am I the asshole?",0,1749640270.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False

I’d appreciate some outside perspective on a confusing and emotionally painful situation I’m going through. 

I (30F) met this guy (34M) about 7 months ago. The very first time we met was in person at a bar. We had a natural connection that night, and afterward, we added each other on social media and stayed in light contact for a while, just casual messaging.

Around that time, he started seeing another woman (non-exclusively), which he was honest with me about. Meanwhile, he and I would occasionally hang out in a platonic way — park walks, gym classes, just friendly connection. Once that other situation ended, he and I gradually became more intimate.

At first, it was clearly sexual. We weren’t having deep conversations and we kept it light. But then we started getting a little more involved in each other’s lives — sending voice notes, videos, and pictures of what we were doing. We were in regular contact. It felt close.

2 months later, some feelings started to surface — and that’s when he pulled away. He told me that he wasn’t comfortable with the fact that I’m a single mom to a four-year-old girl. He said it gently, but clearly. So we ended things and went no contact.

A few weeks later, I reached out to get my wallet and briefcase back. His response was cold and defensive — he said he was already planning to return them and suggested he drops them off without contact as he took my request to be blunt and cold. I suggested we stay mature, and a quick coffee meetup, and after that, he re-initiated contact over social media. We slowly re-engaged, and eventually became sexual again.

This time, things deepened. Our sex life was passionate and connected (we both expressed it was the best we’ve had), but more than that, we began having late-night conversations, emotional openness, and real trust. He’d say things like, “You see me,” “You’re so real,” “You make me feel safe.”

Fast forward, 3 months later, he invited me on a 10-day trip to Italy. On that trip, our bond became even deeper — emotionally, physically, and spiritually. We spent nearly every moment together. We had two small arguments (our first ever), and he told me afterward how much he respected my calmness and emotional maturity and that he was not used to that from past relationships. He said he respects that I’m a mom and that’s why I have my priorities straight and that he wouldn’t change anything about me.

We also connected spiritually in a way I’ve never experienced before. We spoke about energy, personal growth, consciousness, healing — it felt like we were mirrors to each other. It was deep and grounding and completely unlike any dynamic I’ve had before. When I say it was intense, I don’t say it lightly…

Before that trip (not right before, but a few weeks earlier), I told him I loved him — not in a romantic, “I’m in love” way, but just that I loved him as a person. I downplayed it because I was scared of being vulnerable, especially since I’ve never told a man that first. He didn’t say it back at the time — but after the trip, he told me he loved me. He said I was the most special woman he’d ever met. That I was rare. That I needed to be protected and my heart is very kind and big.

He also started talking about making our relationship public, introducing me to his family, taking more trips together. He invited me to his family home (he still lives with his family, but his parents were away, so it was just his sister and her fiancé). He said he was thinking of asking me to be his girlfriend.

But even with all that, he kept hesitating. The thing that kept coming up was that I have a child — and an ex. Even though I reassured him again and again that he’d never have to carry any financial or emotional burden, that my daughter already has a present and loving father, and that my ex and I are very amicable — he still couldn’t get past it.

He told me that if we were to continue seriously, he’d need a right to co-parent. That he couldn’t accept a situation where another man was still involved in the background. He described it as a “power play” — that he couldn’t be okay with stepping into a life that was already formed.

Then, just before a trip he had planned to Australia, he came over and brought up the girlfriend label again. He said he thought he’d be ready after our last weekend, but he wasn’t. He said he needed space during the trip. He still wanted to stay in touch, be flirty, have phone sex, etc. But something felt off.

After we were intimate that night, I told him I hadn’t been emotionally present — that the ambiguity was getting to me. I explained that for me, exclusivity isn’t a heavy commitment — it’s just about mutual respect. He said he felt pressured. He left suddenly.

The next day, he messaged me saying that everything had moved too fast emotionally, and he wasn’t ready for this journey. He said I was taking away his chance to experience firsts — like having a child, holidays, travels — with someone new alone without a child. That it was too much, and he needed to step back. Even though a week before, he was so sure and that he said I’m so worth it and we both are financially capable and have the resources to make this work out.

I told him I understood, even though I was heartbroken. That was over 10 days ago. Since then — total silence. No texts, no social media. It’s like he vanished. From “I love you” and “you’re rare” to absolutely nothing. The timing was so cruel after such emotional high. He also said now that he knows that women like me exist, then there must be others like me and I’m now his standard. He wants someone like me. 

I’m not here to ask if he’s a bad person or to blame anyone. I just feel really destabilized by the emotional whiplash. We had something that felt profound — emotionally, spiritually, physically. And I’m trying to understand: •	How could someone go from so emotionally present and completely head over heels with you to completely disconnected overnight? •	Could this be a case of emotional avoidance? •	Is the child/ex dynamic really the issue — or just a surface-level excuse for deeper fears?

He also still has my belongings and won’t be back from his travels for another week. They’re replaceable things, but should I still ask for them back?

Any advice on how to process this or what I should do next would really help. Thanks for reading.


TL;DR:
I (30F) had a 7-month emotionally and spiritually deep relationship with a man (34M). He told me he loved me, called me rare, and said he wanted a future — but also kept hesitating to commit, mainly because I have a child from a previous relationship. Despite my reassurances that he wouldn’t need to take on a parenting role, he said the dynamic felt like a “power play.” After returning from an intimate trip together, he told me he wasn’t ready for the emotional weight of it all and disappeared completely. It’s been over 10 days of silence. I’m trying to understand if this was fear, avoidance, or something else — and whether I should ask for my belongings back once he’s home from his trip.

1l8pv6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthfulMama/comments/1l8pv6y/exercise_snacking_routines_for_busy_workfromhome/,exercise snacking routines for busy work‑from‑home lifestyles,"# Exercise Snacking: The Perfect Fitness Hack for Busy Work-From-Home Lifestyles

Working from home brings many perks—no commute, flexible hours, and a more comfortable environment. But it also comes with a hidden cost: long hours of sitting, fewer steps taken, and often, exercise slipping down the priority list. That’s where *exercise snacking* comes in—a bite-sized fitness trend that’s changing how remote workers stay active.

# What Is Exercise Snacking?

Exercise snacking refers to doing short bursts of physical activity—typically 1 to 10 minutes—spread throughout the day. Unlike traditional workouts that require a 30- to 60-minute block of time, exercise snacking fits into your daily schedule in quick, manageable chunks.

You don’t need a gym membership or fancy equipment. These “snacks” can be as simple as bodyweight squats between meetings, a brisk 5-minute walk, or a quick set of jumping jacks before lunch.

# Why It Works for Remote Workers

Work-from-home life often blends professional and personal boundaries, making it harder to commit to lengthy workouts. With back-to-back Zoom calls and endless to-do lists, carving out an hour for exercise feels overwhelming. But fitting in **multiple short sessions**? Much easier.

Here’s why exercise snacking is ideal for remote workers:

* **Breaks up sedentary time**: Sitting for hours can impact metabolism, circulation, and posture. Short movement breaks improve blood flow and reduce stiffness.
* **Boosts focus and energy**: A quick round of lunges or a minute of high knees can wake up your brain better than a third cup of coffee.
* **Reduces stress**: Moving regularly releases endorphins, which combat stress and improve mood—something many remote workers need.
* **Improves consistency**: It’s easier to stay active when you eliminate the mental hurdle of needing “a perfect time” to work out.

# How to Start an Exercise Snacking Routine

Ready to try it? Here’s how to build your own exercise snacking routine at home:

**1. Set Your Triggers**  
Link each snack to an existing habit or task. For example:

* 10 squats after each bathroom break
* A 1-minute plank before you check email
* 20 jumping jacks between Zoom calls

**2. Schedule Snack Alarms**  
Set reminders every 60 to 90 minutes. Use calendar notifications or fitness apps that nudge you to move. Think of these as meetings with your body.

**3. Choose Simple, Effective Moves**  
Pick exercises that get your heart rate up or strengthen key muscle groups:

* **Bodyweight squats**
* **Wall sits**
* **Push-ups**
* **Jumping jacks**
* **Stair climbing**
* **High knees or butt kicks**
* **Marching in place**
* **Desk push-offs or tricep dips on a chair**

**4. Keep It Short and Fun**  
Even **1 to 3 minutes** can make a difference. Don’t worry about sweat or changing clothes—just move!

# Sample Exercise Snacking Day

Here’s an example of how a typical remote workday might look with exercise snacks built in:

|Time|Snack|
|:-|:-|
|9:00 AM|2 minutes of jumping jacks after coffee|
|10:30 AM|15 bodyweight squats|
|12:00 PM|1-minute wall sit + 30-second plank|
|2:00 PM|Walk around the block or inside stairs|
|3:30 PM|10 push-ups + 10 chair dips|
|5:00 PM|2-minute dance break before signing off|

That’s **just 10–15 minutes total**—spread out with little effort.

# The Bigger Impact Over Time

While these micro-workouts may seem small, research shows they **add up**. Regular movement throughout the day improves:

* Cardiovascular health
* Insulin sensitivity
* Strength and mobility
* Mental clarity and productivity

Even if you’re already doing longer workouts, sprinkling in exercise snacks can prevent stiffness and boost energy between sessions.

# Final Thoughts

You don’t have to choose between productivity and fitness. Exercise snacking is proof that staying active while working from home can be **simple, flexible, and even enjoyable**. It’s about creating small habits that support your health—without adding stress to your schedule.

So next time you feel sluggish at your desk, get up and give your body a quick, energizing snack. Your mind—and muscles—will thank you.",1,1749640187.0,HealthfulMama,0,1.0,False
1l8puzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrategyArts/comments/1l8puzm/how_to_connect_with_your_audience_effectively/,How to Connect with Your Audience Effectively: Creating a Winning Outreach Plan,"https://preview.redd.it/witxn7vsgune1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=263b4494aa25e61cc145abbee41071e9c0db6e22

When I started thinking about how to reach my audience, I wasn’t excited—I was downright terrified. Marketing? Sales? Talking to people? These weren’t just outside my comfort zone—they were in a different time zone altogether.  I had no idea how to connect with people, much less convince them to buy something.  

“Outreach plan” wasn’t in my vocabulary—I was just trying to figure out how do I reach people? What should the foundation of my marketing strategy even be?. Every guide I read online  felt generic and disconnected from what I needed for my business. The more I looked, the more overwhelmed I felt, and the less confident I became. So now I didn’t just lack confidence—I lacked direction.

Still, I had to start somewhere.  My first attempts were rough, to say the least. I dove in without a plan, I threw ideas at the wall without really thinking about the people I was trying to reach, trying to broadcast my vision and posting on social media with no clear message. I assumed that marketing is about pushing our idea out into the world and that a good idea will speak for itself.  

The result? ... Crickets (I can still hear them sometimes). Why does this happen? Because it’s easy to underestimate how much thought and strategy is needed to connect with people in a meaningful way—and without that connection, even the best ideas can fail to gain traction.

It feels like being that one friend at a party who tells a joke that nobody hears and now you are just standing there staring into the abyss.

# How It Works And Why It Matters

After fumbling through my first attempts, I realized that what I needed was structure—a roadmap to guide me through the chaos. That’s where the Outreach Plan came in. It helped me focus on understanding my Ideal Client Profile (ICP), crafting messages that spoke directly to their needs, and choosing the right channels to deliver those messages. It was like having a coach walk me through each step, turning my anxiety into confidence.  No more shouting into the void; I was connecting.

# Step-by-Step Process:

* **Key Messaging Point:** Start by developing a core message that addresses your ICP’s pain points. Craft messages that empathize deeply with their struggles and inspire them by showcasing the results they could achieve. For example, if your audience struggles with time management, your message could focus on the peace and control they’d gain by using your solution.
* **Online Channels:** Identify the platforms your audience frequents. This might include social media, email, blogs, or webinars. Knowing where they spend time is crucial to getting your message in front of them.
* **Online Placement:** Strategize your message delivery. Should it be a catchy social ad? A value-packed email? Or maybe an engaging blog post with a call to action? Test what works best.
* **Offline Channels:** Don’t underestimate the power of offline engagement. Think events, flyers, or even a well-timed coffee meeting. Sometimes, personal touches make all the difference.
* **Offline Placement:** Consider how your offline message will land. Is it a short pitch at a networking event? A printed case study handed to a potential partner? Tailor your approach to the setting and audience.

# Mindset & Approach:

This now became the foundation of my marketing strategy, but remember the magic isn’t just in the steps; it’s in understanding *why* they work. Your audience don’t want to feel targeted; they want to feel understood. Approach this process with genuine empathy and a willingness to adapt. A rigid plan won’t work for every scenario, so be prepared to tweak your strategy as you learn more about what resonates.

By applying the principles of the Outreach Plan board, I was able to turn disconnected chaos into a cohesive, actionable strategy that not only reached my audience but inspired them to engage. This experience led me to incorporate what I learned into the Project Development Framework (PDF), ensuring others could benefit without going through the same trial and error.

Chapter 1  
  
When I finally kicked the bucket of old age,  
  
My husband had wept inconsolably at my funeral—like, completely shattered.  
  
And my childhood friend? He couldn't even speak through his tears as he delivered my eulogy.  
  
However, given a second chance at life, they both refused to apply to Harvard with me, choosing instead to join a college prep program year after year with Scarlett, our class queen.  
  
So I chose to study abroad. From then on, we went our separate ways, never to meet again.  
  
By the turn of the millennium, I'd built a successful career and returned home in triumph with my daughter.  
  
The airport was packed with people.  
  
Yet two intense gazes cut through the crowd, landing heavily on me.  
  
""Winter, is this your niece?""  
  
""If you still have feelings for me... maybe we could start over?""  
  
\---  
  
""Winter, you've got one day left to submit your college applications. Why haven't you filled anything out yet?""  
  
""Miss the deadline and you'll have to repeat senior year.""  
  
Ms. Rodriguez looked at me with genuine concern.  
  
""I'm waiting for someone. Don't want to make the wrong choice,"" I said with an awkward smile.  
  
My fingers kept tracing over the application form, lingering on two blank lines—Kai Sullivan and Jaxon Rivers. Still empty.  
  
Also blank was Scarlett Monroe's application.  
  
I was starting to piece it together, though my heart refused to accept what I knew was coming.  
  
I couldn't face it. Wouldn't even let myself consider it.  
  
Suddenly, familiar footsteps echoed from the hallway.  
  
The people I'd been waiting for had arrived.  
  
Kai pushed through the door, afternoon sunlight cutting across his sharp cheekbones.  
  
Jaxon followed close behind, his white button-down stretched tight across his shoulders, those bedroom eyes clouded with something dark and unreadable.  
  
Ms. Rodriguez quickly set down her coffee mug.  
  
""Our valedictorian and salutatorian! Finally here to submit your applications!""  
  
""Harvard and Princeton have been calling non-stop this week. Which one's it gonna be?""  
  
""Or... are you planning to join Winter at Columbia?""  
  
My heart hammered against my ribs, hope blooming in my chest.  
  
In my previous life, they'd both chosen Columbia without hesitation, staying by my side until the very end.  
  
But sometimes, after too many drinks, they'd mentioned regretting going to Columbia.  
  
I'd always thought they meant they regretted not choosing Harvard instead.  
  
Until Kai paused, then said with resignation:  
  
""Actually, Ms. Rodriguez, we're not applying anywhere.""  
  
""We're planning to take a gap year. Help out a classmate who needs support.""  
  
That's when it hit me—last life, they regretted not staying back with Scarlett when she failed her SATs. Without their support, she'd failed again and thrown herself off the Tobin Bridge.  
  
The news had reached us during my birthday party. They'd been dismissive then.  
  
""She's dead and gone. Why should we let it ruin our good time?""  
  
They'd always been annoyed by Scarlett's desperate attempts to win their attention.  
  
So, none of us had gone to her funeral.  
  
Hearing their choices, Ms. Rodriguez stared at them in shock.  
  
""I'm sorry, did I hear that right?""  
  
""Supporting struggling students is admirable, but that's what guidance counselors are for!""  
  
Jaxon, who'd been silent until now, frowned deeply.  
  
""We won't change our minds.""  
  
""Please respect our call and sign us up for the college prep program.""  
  
Kai nodded in agreement.  
  
His gaze fell on my blank application, and a cruel smile played at his lips.  
  
""Ms. Rodriguez, don't tell me someone's been whispering in your ear, trying to pressure us into applying to college?""  
  
""We're not interested in Columbia.""  
  
""And we're especially not interested in anyone who wants to go there.""  
  
The words hit like a physical blow.  
  
I hadn't done anything wrong, yet shame burned through me, my cheeks blazing red.  
  
They finished their paperwork and bolted from the room.  
  
Obviously desperate to find Scarlett.  
  
In my past life, even when my water broke in the back of a taxi, they'd never moved with such urgency.  
  
I swallowed the bitter taste of heartbreak.  
  
After several deep breaths, I managed to speak.  
  
""Ms. Rodriguez, I won't be applying either.""  
  
She looked ready to explode.  
  
""This is ridiculous!""  
  
""I've seen you carving Columbia's logo into your desk!""  
  
""Just because these two idiots won't go to college with you doesn't mean you should throw away your dreams!""  
  
The unexpected kindness made my throat tight with emotion.  
  
I shook my head quickly.  
  
""College here isn't my only option.""  
  
""My aunt lives in London. She's already secured me a spot at Cambridge.""  
  
""Please... don't tell them where I'm going.""  
  
They wanted a different life.  
  
Fine. I'd burn every bridge between us and never look back.  
  
From this moment on, we were nothing to each other.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Word spread fast around campus.  
  
Soon everyone knew I wasn't going to college either.  
  
At the graduation farewell party, classmates whispered among themselves.  
  
""Wait, don't Kai and Jaxon like Winter? But they're taking a gap year for Scarlett instead!""  
  
""I guess that proves Scarlett's better than Winter. Those two are like, every girl's dream guys—their standards must be sky-high!""  
  
""And Winter's not applying anywhere either? That's so pathetic. What kind of girl throws herself at guys like that?""  
  
Each word felt like a knife twisting in my chest.  
  
But I kept my head down, saying nothing.  
  
Scarlett sat on a small stool nearby, giggling sweetly.  
  
Kai and Jaxon flanked her, taking turns cracking jokes to make her laugh.  
  
Her laughter wasn't even that loud.  
  
But it felt like it was piercing straight through my eardrums.  
  
In my past life, after Dad died, I fell into a deep depression. The doctor told my loved ones to tell me jokes, help ease the pain.  
  
But until the day I died, they never told me a single one.  
  
Now here was Kai, gazing at her adoringly.  
  
""Scarlett, you should smile more.""  
  
Jaxon chimed in tenderly.  
  
""I'll help bring your grades up step by step. I promise you'll have a bright future.""  
  
""Seeing you smile—that's all I need to feel at peace.""  
  
So they did know how to tell jokes. They just never wanted to waste the effort on me.  
  
I clutched the yearbook I'd meant to give them, unable to bring myself to hand it over.  
  
How pathetic, really.  
  
I was moving to Cambridge, and I still wanted to take their messages with me as some kind of keepsake for the rest of my life.  
  
I couldn't blame myself for being lovesick.  
  
The feelings from my past life ran too deep.  
  
Back then, they'd brought me meals in all kinds of weather, stayed up all night when I had fevers.  
  
Scarlett glanced back at me with a mocking smile.  
  
""Winter, aren't you repeating senior year? Why are you handing out yearbooks?""  
  
""Trying to find an excuse to talk to them?""  
  
Kai's eyes turned ice-cold.  
  
""Give it up. I'm not signing that thing.""  
  
Jaxon remained expressionless, then loosened up slightly.  
  
""I guess we could write something.""  
  
""On one condition—you give Scarlett all your study notes.""  
  
With their photographic memories, they never took notes.  
  
So my three years of carefully compiled notes would become Scarlett's tool for quick grade improvement.  
  
Bitterness flooded my heart.  
  
But I nodded without showing any emotion.  
  
""Sure, you can borrow them. The notes won't do me any good anymore.""  
  
""But don't bother signing the yearbook.""  
  
They frowned in confusion.  
  
""You're actually agreeing?""  
  
I'd always been someone who didn't let people take advantage of me. There was no way I'd just hand things over to someone I disliked.  
  
But this time I'd agreed so readily.  
  
Jaxon suddenly laughed coldly.  
  
""Why bother acting all high and mighty?""  
  
""At the end of the day, you just want any excuse to get close to us, right? Fine, we'll give you what you want.""  
  
They snatched my yearbook away.  
  
Both wrote very brief entries, just signing their names under the ""Like"" and ""Dislike"" columns.  
  
Like—Scarlett.  
  
Dislike—Winter.  
  
Those few light words hung over my head like a blade. I unconsciously clenched the paper so tight—nails dug so deep into my palm, blood stained the words.  
  
Seeing my face go pale as a sheet, Kai and Jaxon exchanged triumphant smiles.  
  
Then they leaned over to whisper in Scarlett's ear, telling her what they'd written.  
  
Scarlett burst into laughter, tears of mirth streaming down her face.  
  
""You two are so mean!""  
  
""Oh, Winter—I'm going on a graduation trip with them tomorrow. Drop those notes off at my house, okay?""  
  
In my past life, when my depression made me want to go out and walk around for some fresh air, I'd begged them to travel with me. They had nothing going on but claimed they were too busy.  
  
This life, they were giving Scarlett everything they'd denied me.  
  
Bone-deep coldness spread through my heart.  
  
I suddenly felt like this was all so pointless.  
  
After they walked away, I threw the yearbook in the trash without hesitation.  
  
The things you beg for and can never get will someday become worthless.  
  
For the entire month that followed, Kai and Jaxon made a point of taking Scarlett to Boston, Chicago, San Francisco—all the major cities.  
  
The plan was for her to pick whichever city she liked, then they'd work their asses off to get her into a prestigious university there next year.  
  
From then on, they'd spend their lives taking care of her, just like they had with me in my previous life.  
  
When I first heard these rumors, my heart ached endlessly.  
  
But after hurting for so long, I went numb.  
  
Instead, I threw myself into preparing for the SAT Subject Tests and getting my student visa sorted for the UK.  
  
Thanks to my relentless effort, my application got approved, and several top British universities extended offers.  
  
On the first day of the college prep program, I grabbed my plane ticket and packed my bags.  
  
I'd just locked my door and was about to leave when Kai and Jaxon came marching toward me, looking pissed.  
  
I tried to avoid them.  
  
But Kai blocked my path, eyeing my luggage.  
  
""So you're running late for the first day because you were waiting for us to carry your bags to the dorm?""  
  
""Winter, could you be any more pathetically delusional?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I clenched my clothes tight.  
  
Not wanting to cause a scene and miss my flight, I simply asked:  
  
""What do you want?""  
  
Jaxon hurled a thick notebook at me.  
  
""You know damn well what you did!""  
  
""The whole thing's crossed out with red pen—not a single page is readable!""  
  
""Ruining the notes is one thing, but why the hell did you write 'bitch' and 'slut' all over it!""  
  
A sharp pain shot through me.  
  
I rubbed my shoulder, wincing, and flipped through the notebook.  
  
My expression turned cold, heart filled with resignation.  
  
""She staged this whole thing herself. What's it got to do with me?""  
  
What a hopeless case.  
  
A perfectly good study guide turned into her tool for playing victim and marking territory.  
  
Right as I finished speaking,  
  
Scarlett's pitiful voice piped up.  
  
""Kai, Jaxon, I didn't...""  
  
""I don't know what I did wrong to make Winter treat me like this.""  
  
""I've never been humiliated like this in my life. I can't even eat—how am I supposed to study?""  
  
Kai was shaking with rage.  
  
""Get on your knees and apologize!""  
  
""Then go to the school broadcast station and confess what you did in front of everyone!""  
  
Jaxon tossed me a pen.  
  
""And you're writing a guarantee!""  
  
""If you screw up Scarlett's college entrance exams, you forfeit your right to go to college!""  
  
My fingernails dug deep into my palms.  
  
Fighting back my anger, I said:  
  
""I already gave that up.""  
  
""Look closely—this is a 1 PM flight. I'm going abroad for college.""  
  
Kai frantically grabbed the plane ticket from my hands.  
  
""Abroad?""  
  
Both of them scrutinized it, their eyes filled with shock and disbelief.  
  
""Holy shit, it's real...""  
  
I snatched it right back.  
  
""If you don't mind, please don't mess with my future.""  
  
I noticed Scarlett looking a bit deflated.  
  
Soon enough, Kai's face returned to its cold mask.  
  
""Never thought you'd get this jealous.""  
  
""Showing up late on purpose to make me come find you, then pulling out a plane ticket to force me to leave Scarlett and chase after you instead.""  
  
Jaxon had his eureka moment too, sneering:  
  
""Going abroad, huh? Nobody's stopping you.""  
  
""Give it three days and you'll come crawling back home. Don't come crying to me.""  
  
I ignored them completely.  
  
Didn't even spare them a glance.  
  
Just rushed to flag down a bus and hopped on.  
  
Through the transparent window,  
  
I caught a glimpse of them looking at Scarlett with something different in their eyes.  
  
Different how?  
  
I couldn't tell, and I didn't care to figure it out.  
  
Not having to analyze their feelings anymore—what a relief.  
  
Seriously, I was capable and strong.  
  
Soon, I adapted to life at Cambridge quickly.  
  
Every day brought new challenges and excitement.  
  
News from back home barely reached my ears.  
  
I almost forgot.  
  
Forgot that there were once two men who'd consumed my thoughts, men I'd begged to see again in my dying breath.  
  
Until Christmas, a few months later.  
  
An international package arrived at my apartment.  
  
When I opened it, it was that yearbook I'd thrown in the trash.  
  
All the stains had been carefully cleaned off, and it even smelled of my favorite pine incense.  
  
As for those mocking words about me—they'd been scraped away with a blade.  
  
In their place were two lines written in elegant handwriting:  
  
\[Cambridge, heavy snow.\]  
  
\[You always get sick when seasons change—stay warm.\]  
  
My name had ""winter"" in it, but I hated the cold most of all.  
  
Back when I was starting my business, living in a drafty rental during winter, Jaxon would rush over to patch up the gaps, then always warm up a hot water bottle for me.  
  
He used to say, ""Winter, I'll always be by your side. I won't let you freeze.""  
  
Thinking of this, I lowered my eyes.  
  
After a moment's thought, I lit a match and burned the yearbook to ash.  
  
It had already become trash.  
  
No point trying to restore it to perfect condition now.  
  
I thought that would be the end of it.  
  
A few days later, another international call came through.  
  
It was Kai's voice.  
  
""Are you... doing okay?""  
  
""If you're really not, I wouldn't mind if you came back.""  
  
I just shook my head.  
  
My voice was completely flat.  
  
""Whether I'm good or bad—what's that to you?""  
  
""Please don't interfere with my life, okay?""  
  
Kai paused, his tone getting frantic and distorted.  
  
""Look, you're just pissed I chose Scarlett instead of going to Columbia with you, right?""  
  
""If I promise you I will, would you come back?""

So me and this girl have been friends for three years since moving to college. 4 girls always stuck together. We all went to a community college and plans were after two years we transfer to the local university. Well. Two of them from LA (let’s call them Lauren and Kathy) and one is from inland of that (Morgan) so. All was well the first year ish. Lauren was obviously boy crazy but it was whatever, we were freshman in college. Then I quickly realized most house issues were revolved around Lauren. Kathy is my BEST friend now but she went to HS with Lauren but treated Kathy like SHIT. Like purposely left her out blah blah. Fast forward two years and now we’re here. Morgan got her AA and is moving in with her boyfriend to do hair. Things have been HORRIBLE with Lauren. 
I’ve always been a really forgiving person. But I’m a cunt when needed, I don’t mind sticking up for myself and others. Lauren stopped doing things around the house, less than she was freshman year. As years went on it was just worse and worse and Kathy always did everything for her. She’s a people pleaser. I also realized Lauren is a pathological liar. I’m now at the university and Kathy isn’t yet there nor is Lauren. But Lauren takes her friends uni pi phi sweatshirts, tells everyone she goes there, etc. on top of this I really stopped giving a shit when she left me alone at a bar and told me to wait for 30 min while she went somewhere else. She is always the victim in her story too and everyone around her for some reason enables it. Also dishes were constantly left everywhere even when everyone asked her to clean them. Left EVERYTHING everywhere. Her guy friends were dicks, litterally took my bike and it’s forever gone becuase they lost it. Talks shit on every one of her friends, etc. overall just the worst person I’ve possibly met.

Anyways, now we’re coming on the re-lease time. I’m leaving for a few months next quarter so I was like whatever I guess I’ll just bare through it becuase honestly I didn’t want to step on any toes and was over it. Well, Lauren is left with her dishes to do and Morgan asks her to do them before she leaves for a trip (she’s left them many times before) she scattered them around the house as if we’re fucking idiots and said she did them and left. So, Morgan took up my joke of leaving them on her bed… so she came back three days later and lost it. Said nothing. Chucked all the plates in the backyard etc. left the house for a day and texted us she’s terminating her lease. Boy oh boy you couldn’t even imagine how fast I went to go find a new roomate. I found two (Lauren’s place and Morgan’s place) PERFECT girls and met them and everything. Lauren sent us a paper we needed to sign to terminate her and approve her for the rent and I signed and sent it to Kathy and she was on a long trip so didn’t get to it. Two weeks pass and Lauren changed her mind. She had earlier found her friends place to live in for $ 1100 but changed her mind becuase she THOUGHT the other room here was cheaper. It’s not (1250) and she’s always talking about how her mom can’t afford to pay for anywhere else. (Also maybe a lie). THEN GO HOME YOUR ABOUT TO BE A SENIOR IN COLLEGE EQUAL TO A FRESHMAN WITH NO CREDITS BECUASE YOU DONT EVER DO SCHOOL YOU JUST FUCK MEN AND LIE ALL DAMN DAY. Anyways, she texts me and says (we haven’t spoken in weeks) hey, is there still a spot open. I said no sorry the other girls signed the lease (we were supposed to go in the next day) she responded while I let out the biggest heave I’ve ever hooved “you never signed the terminating paper”. When I tell u I got my ass up SO fast and went to the leasing office for them to print it out. 10 min later… she’s there. FOLLOWED ME. It’s closed for lunch. I go to a coffee shop and wait it out, she does the same outside of the office. She goes in first and SIGNED A LEASE WITH ME KATHY HER AND ONE OF THE GIRLS I FOUND THAT SHE HAD NEVER MET. So I try telling the receptionist becuase our landlord isn’t there. Now, we are a week past and I’m too to go in tomorrow to try and rationalize with him. (He emailed me saying that if I never signed the terminating lease then she’s technically still on it). Kathy is on my side too keep in mind. So now I have four girls to fill this house. If one of these girls leaves in order for Lauren to take her spot, the other will too. So we will have two missing spots to try and fill (nobody is looking for housing anymore) by the end of this month. Or I’m gonna terminate the lease and have Lauren sign off on it and then ask my landlord if we could apply for the house separately considering she has no roomates to offer. I can NOT let this girl win. If anyone has advice before tomorrow at two HELP. But more importantly am I the asshole?",3,1749639987.0,neighborsfromhell,1,0.8,False

With the latest short interest numbers released by NASDAQ today, there’s never been a better time to unpack what’s really going on under the hood in $ATYR. Over the past day alone, the share price rocketed from $5.39 up to $5.98—smashing through the 52-week high—before swiftly reversing and closing at $5.50. These moves came right after pivotal events: the Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference, a positive SSC-ILD readout, a run of news, and all of it with Q3’s major catalyst now squarely in view.

The numbers are truly eye-popping: short interest has surged to a record 13.77 million shares as of May 30, while days-to-cover remains stubbornly high. All this in a stock where institutional and high-conviction retail ownership are both rising, and where the float is visibly tightening by the week.

So what’s actually happening? In my view, you can’t understand $ATYR’s current setup—or what could unfold in the next few months—without a full appreciation for how short selling, options positioning, and institutional mechanics all interact in a name like this. This post aims to provide the most comprehensive breakdown yet, cutting through the noise to show not just what’s happening, but why it matters for anyone holding (or considering) $ATYR into the next leg.

As you’ve come to expect, this is going to be a comprehensive, long-form post—true institutional-grade, but with a practical voice for retail investors. That said, I’ve put hours into pulling together data, cross-referencing options chains, news, and market structure signals, and breaking it down for the community in a way that I hope anyone can follow. If you get value from this or from any of my work, I’d genuinely appreciate your support. A few readers buying me a coffee each day is what makes this research possible and keeps it free and independent. Thanks so much to everyone who’s already supported—your contributions really do make all the difference.

### Introduction: Why Short Interest Matters Right Now

With the short interest numbers just released, the time is perfect to zoom out and understand the true market mechanics at play. The last week has been a wild ride for $ATYR, with huge volatility and record engagement from both sides of the trade. The most important thing for any investor now is to understand not just the surface-level data, but the dynamics underneath: float, options, institutional behavior, and how all of these intertwine heading into a stacked Q3.

---

### A Quick Primer: Short Selling 101 - How Short Selling Really Works

For anyone new to these mechanics (or just wanting a refresher), here’s what’s actually going on when someone “shorts” a stock:

1. **Locating and Borrowing Shares:**  
A short seller borrows shares from a broker or institutional lender (often via margin accounts), paying a borrow fee. In a tight-float stock, these fees can become significant—and sometimes, shares aren’t available at all.

2. **Selling Into the Market:**  
Those borrowed shares are sold at the current market price, with the goal of buying them back (“covering”) at a lower price in the future.

3. **Returning the Shares:**  
The short seller buys back the shares at the lower price and returns them to the lender, pocketing the difference (minus fees/interest).

4. **Risks and Costs:**  
If the price goes up instead of down, shorts face unlimited theoretical losses and may be forced to cover (buy back) at a loss, especially if margin calls are triggered.

**Who lends the shares, and why?**  
Big institutional holders—mutual funds, pension funds, prime brokers—lend shares for a fee. Sometimes, institutions use clever internal arrangements to lend shares to themselves, facilitate market making, or manage options risk. It’s an entire ecosystem, and in my experience, it’s rarely transparent to the average retail investor.

**Why do institutions short?**
- To express a negative view (classic bearish bet)
- To hedge long positions or options exposure
- To facilitate market making (especially when call open interest is high)
- Sometimes, to suppress price around key events or expiry windows
- To exploit liquidity gaps or weak hands

Here’s why this is critical for $ATYR: When the float is tight, every new short means one less share available for organic trading. When you combine this with a rising options open interest, a loaded catalyst schedule, and increased retail conviction, you create a market structure where small supply/demand mismatches can lead to very large price swings.

**So why should you care?**  
Because the mechanics here aren’t just academic: they have direct, real-world impacts on price action, liquidity, and—crucially—how fast the stock can move when the music changes. In a setup like $ATYR, where so much of the float is locked away by institutions and retail conviction, high short interest is like a powder keg.

**Key takeaway:** The mechanics of short selling in a tight float can exacerbate both downside and upside. Shorts are betting not just against the company, but that liquidity will be available when they want out.

---

### Context: The $ATYR Setup Heading Into Q3

In my opinion, what makes $ATYR so unique right now is the convergence of several powerful forces:
- Institutional ownership last reported at 70% (end of March 2025), but every sign suggests it’s moved even higher through Q2
- Convicted retail now estimated at over 7 million shares—likely higher as of June, given community tracking and anecdotal feedback
- A rapidly tightening float, as both groups “lock away” shares, leaving less available for trading (and, by extension, for shorts to cover into)
- A series of major catalysts—positive SSC-ILD readout, bullish Jefferies Conference, and a critical Q3 data release ahead—that have intensified both long and short positioning
- An options market with staggering open interest at key call strikes, magnifying the effects of shorting and hedging mechanics

In short, the setup is both rare and potentially explosive—either way.

### Why This Short Interest Release Matters More Than Ever

Short interest isn’t just a number for the finance nerds. In a name like $ATYR—where the float is already extremely tight and both institutional and retail conviction are surging—it’s a living, breathing metric for market stress. Here’s why this specific release is a game-changer:

- **Short interest has surged to an all-time high**—now at 13.77 million shares as of 30 May 2025. That’s up more than 1.1 million shares in two weeks, a huge jump that’s anything but accidental. It reflects heavy, coordinated institutional activity, not just scattered bearish retail bets.
- **Days to cover remain highly elevated**, bouncing between 8 and 11 for months. That’s the number of trading days it would take to buy back every shorted share at current average daily volume. For context, anything above 5 is considered “elevated”; above 10 is a powder keg if sentiment flips.
- **This is happening alongside a dramatic tightening of the float.** The last reported institutional ownership (as of March) was 70%, but based on Q2 filings and observed block trades, it’s likely even higher now. Convicted retail ownership is also above 7 million shares. In my opinion, actual tradable float is rapidly shrinking—raising the risk for shorts, especially with catalysts on deck.

**So what?** When you combine massive short interest with a shrinking pool of shares and a loaded event calendar, you’re not just looking at a technical risk—you’re looking at a setup where the “coiled spring” effect can be triggered by any real or perceived positive shock. It’s exactly this sort of configuration that’s caused major, reflexive moves in other high-short, tight-float names in recent years.

The progression is striking. Nine months ago, there were fewer than 2 million shares sold short. Now, there are almost 14 million—and the days to cover have risen substantially. This isn’t a slow burn; it’s an arms race.

### Institutional Motives and Tactics: Beyond the Obvious

In my view, it’s a mistake to see this short build as simply “the market thinks $ATYR is overvalued.” Institutions use shorting in more nuanced ways, including:

- **Event suppression and options expiry pinning:** Some shorts lean on the price ahead of major catalysts (like the Q3 readout or Jefferies conference), aiming to keep shares below key call strikes to minimize institutional payout risk.
- **Dark pool executions and block trades:** Shorts may coordinate large trades off-market to avoid moving the price, often with the assistance of prime brokers or through internal lending within large funds.
- **Synthetic shorts via options:** Some institutions don’t short directly but replicate short exposure using puts or call spreads. High open interest at particular strikes (e.g., $5, $6, $7.50, $10) creates incentive for price suppression around those levels.
- **Liquidity engineering:** By lending shares to themselves across different funds or accounts, some institutions can artificially manufacture supply—creating a deceptive sense of available float.
- **Hedging:** Some shorts are pure hedges against long positions (e.g., “long call, short equity” to cap upside exposure). These hedges can unwind rapidly if the narrative flips bullish.

What’s important for retail investors is understanding that these tactics can and do impact day-to-day price action, especially in the lead-up to catalysts or when options expiry is near.

**Why does this matter?** Because retail often sees “random” price swings or failed breakouts as pure market randomness, when in fact they may be driven by sophisticated positioning that is only visible in the aggregate data (like this short interest report).

---

### The Significance of This Release: A Deep Read Between the Lines

This particular short interest release is, in my opinion, uniquely important. Here’s why:

- **Record shorts into a tightening float:** With nearly 14 million shares short and less than 20 million “true” float (after accounting for locked-up shares), we are at the edge of a supply/demand cliff. Any unanticipated positive news, or even a well-timed block buy, could force rapid, disorderly covering.
- **Days to cover remain stubbornly high:** If even a third of shorts try to cover on a big up-move, there simply aren’t enough natural sellers to meet demand. This is exactly the “coiled spring” dynamic that has triggered parabolic moves in past biotech squeezes.
- **Unprecedented options activity:** The options chain is the most crowded I’ve seen in $ATYR—OI in the thousands at key strikes, IVs >100% across expiries, and aggressive call buying suggesting both speculative and hedging flows. The setup means options market makers themselves may be forced to buy stock into upside, compounding the effect.
- **Catalyst timing:** This release lands with perfect timing: after Jefferies, after the SSC-ILD readout, but before the Q3 event window. In my view, shorts are “leaning in” ahead of these milestones, hoping to push price down or keep it capped until they can unwind with minimal pain.

**The bottom line:** This isn’t just a “high short interest” situation—it’s a perfect storm of structural risk for shorts. It doesn’t guarantee a squeeze or an upside breakout, but it does mean the probability and magnitude of sharp moves—both ways—are much higher than the typical retail investor realizes.

---

### Options Chain and Derivatives: Fuel for the Fire

If you look at the latest options chain, what stands out is:

- **Calls far outweigh puts at almost every major strike**, especially from $5–$10. This is unusual for a biotech with this much short interest and suggests that much of the options flow is speculative upside, not just downside hedging.
- **Implied volatility is extremely high**, often >100% for major expiries, with some strikes >200%. This signals that market makers and participants are bracing for large price moves, likely tied to upcoming catalysts.
- **Open interest is not just retail;** it’s large enough to reflect major institutional positioning, possibly including synthetic shorts and hedges.

**What does this mean?** When calls go deep in the money or when the price runs above max pain, market makers must scramble to hedge, often by buying stock—feeding squeezes. If shorts are forced to cover simultaneously, it becomes a positive feedback loop. Conversely, if the stock gets pinned below major call strikes at expiry, you can see rapid mean reversion and aggressive selling as the “pin” is maintained.

---

### Ownership, Float, and the True Risk for Shorts

As of the last reporting period (March), institutional ownership was at 70%. I suspect, based on the latest 13F and NPORT filings, that number is now much higher. Add in retail conviction (7+ million shares) and it’s very likely that the true free float is smaller than it appears on paper—potentially as little as 10–15 million shares available for trading at any given time.

- **Shorts are now likely exceeding real, available float.** This is the textbook definition of a crowded trade—and it creates asymmetric risk, especially around catalysts.
- **If the Q3 readout (or any surprise event) is positive, the scramble for shares could be severe.** With high options OI and days to cover in the double digits, covering becomes exponentially more difficult the higher the price moves.
- **If shorts are successful in suppressing price through expiry/catalyst,** they may unwind at lower cost, but the longer they wait, the more risk accumulates if sentiment shifts.

---

### Short Squeeze Dynamics: What It Means for $ATYR

The “short squeeze” is a term that gets thrown around a lot, but not always with proper context. Here’s how it’s likely to play out in a setup like $ATYR:

- **A short squeeze occurs when short sellers are forced to buy back shares en masse—usually because the price starts moving against them quickly, their borrow fees spike, or they get margin-called.**
- In my opinion, $ATYR is showing classic pre-squeeze characteristics: heavy, persistent shorting into a tightening float, days-to-cover in the double digits, and a catalyst window that could deliver a sudden sentiment shift.
- The triggers? A positive Q3 data readout, a major block buy, or even just a shift in options market dynamics forcing market makers to hedge up could create the conditions for a violent move higher.
- When a squeeze begins, the buying can become reflexive. The higher the price moves, the more shorts are forced to buy to cover—driving the price higher still. In crowded setups like this, that can result in “parabolic” upside wicks that far exceed any fundamental model in the short run.
- **But remember:** Not every crowded short setup squeezes. Sometimes, institutions manage to lean on price, use dark pools, or coordinate covering slowly. But with each uptick in conviction and reduction in true float, the risks for shorts ratchet higher.

**Why does this matter for retail?** Because, in my view, it’s in these moments that retail investors who understand market structure can have a real edge—spotting the “coiled spring” effect before the rest of the market does. It’s not about betting on a squeeze, but about appreciating just how asymmetric the setup has become.

---

### What Can Retail Investors Take from All This? (Not Advice)

Just to be crystal clear—this is not investment advice, and everyone should do their own due diligence. That said, here are some of the most common theories and tactics that seasoned market participants use in situations like this. These are not recommendations, but food for thought based on historical playbooks and the unique structure of $ATYR right now:

- **Interpreting Price Action:** Sharp drops on low volume, failed breakouts, or big blocks after hours often hint at institutional positioning, not just organic buying or selling. Reading the tape with this context can help separate signal from noise.
- **Watching the Data:** Changes in short interest, days to cover, and options open interest are not just trivia—they’re signals of underlying market structure. Sudden drops in short interest on high volume often mean forced covering, not new shorts.
- **Position Sizing and Volatility:** In setups with elevated short interest and tight float, volatility is both a risk and an opportunity. Larger-than-normal moves are possible—sometimes without warning.
- **Preparing for Catalyst Windows:** The period around Q3 (and any major event) is likely to be highly volatile. If you’re holding, it helps to be mentally prepared for both directions—and not be surprised by “irrational” moves driven by mechanics, not just fundamentals.
- **Collective Intelligence:** Retail communities like this one have an edge in real-time info sharing—flagging block prints, discussing borrow rates, monitoring options flow. In my opinion, collective vigilance can sometimes spot inflection points before the broader market does. Go team!

- The most recent NASDAQ short interest release confirms $ATYR is now at a structural tipping point: a record short position, a shrinking float, and an options chain loaded with both risk and opportunity.
- This isn’t simply “betting against the company”—it’s a complex, institutional game involving hedging, event management, and, at times, an attempt to control price through key calendar windows and expiration dates.
- The combination of a tight float, heavy conviction on both sides, and a major upcoming catalyst creates a textbook “sleeper” squeeze scenario. In my opinion, the risk for shorts is higher than most appreciate, especially as each new catalyst tightens the supply/demand noose.
- If the catalyst triggers forced covering, the moves could be disorderly and fast. If not, shorts may manage to unwind at lower levels—but the longer this tension persists, the more asymmetric the risk becomes for both sides. It really is a powder keg, and in my view, every new short increases the “spring-loaded” nature of this setup.
- My perspective: I’ve rarely seen a setup with this degree of “coiled spring” potential in a mid-cap biotech, especially one where both the fundamental thesis and the underlying market structure are this aligned. In my opinion, what happens in the weeks ahead will be a case study in float dynamics, institutional behavior, and the psychology of conviction.

When I finally kicked the bucket of old age,  
  
My husband had wept inconsolably at my funeral—like, completely shattered.  
  
And my childhood friend? He couldn't even speak through his tears as he delivered my eulogy.  
  
However, given a second chance at life, they both refused to apply to Harvard with me, choosing instead to join a college prep program year after year with Scarlett, our class queen.  
  
So I chose to study abroad. From then on, we went our separate ways, never to meet again.  
  
By the turn of the millennium, I'd built a successful career and returned home in triumph with my daughter.  
  
The airport was packed with people.  
  
Yet two intense gazes cut through the crowd, landing heavily on me.  
  
""Winter, is this your niece?""  
  
""If you still have feelings for me... maybe we could start over?""  
  
\---  
  
""Winter, you've got one day left to submit your college applications. Why haven't you filled anything out yet?""  
  
""Miss the deadline and you'll have to repeat senior year.""  
  
Ms. Rodriguez looked at me with genuine concern.  
  
""I'm waiting for someone. Don't want to make the wrong choice,"" I said with an awkward smile.  
  
My fingers kept tracing over the application form, lingering on two blank lines—Kai Sullivan and Jaxon Rivers. Still empty.  
  
Also blank was Scarlett Monroe's application.  
  
I was starting to piece it together, though my heart refused to accept what I knew was coming.  
  
I couldn't face it. Wouldn't even let myself consider it.  
  
Suddenly, familiar footsteps echoed from the hallway.  
  
The people I'd been waiting for had arrived.  
  
Kai pushed through the door, afternoon sunlight cutting across his sharp cheekbones.  
  
Jaxon followed close behind, his white button-down stretched tight across his shoulders, those bedroom eyes clouded with something dark and unreadable.  
  
Ms. Rodriguez quickly set down her coffee mug.  
  
""Our valedictorian and salutatorian! Finally here to submit your applications!""  
  
""Harvard and Princeton have been calling non-stop this week. Which one's it gonna be?""  
  
""Or... are you planning to join Winter at Columbia?""  
  
My heart hammered against my ribs, hope blooming in my chest.  
  
In my previous life, they'd both chosen Columbia without hesitation, staying by my side until the very end.  
  
But sometimes, after too many drinks, they'd mentioned regretting going to Columbia.  
  
I'd always thought they meant they regretted not choosing Harvard instead.  
  
Until Kai paused, then said with resignation:  
  
""Actually, Ms. Rodriguez, we're not applying anywhere.""  
  
""We're planning to take a gap year. Help out a classmate who needs support.""  
  
That's when it hit me—last life, they regretted not staying back with Scarlett when she failed her SATs. Without their support, she'd failed again and thrown herself off the Tobin Bridge.  
  
The news had reached us during my birthday party. They'd been dismissive then.  
  
""She's dead and gone. Why should we let it ruin our good time?""  
  
They'd always been annoyed by Scarlett's desperate attempts to win their attention.  
  
So, none of us had gone to her funeral.  
  
Hearing their choices, Ms. Rodriguez stared at them in shock.  
  
""I'm sorry, did I hear that right?""  
  
""Supporting struggling students is admirable, but that's what guidance counselors are for!""  
  
Jaxon, who'd been silent until now, frowned deeply.  
  
""We won't change our minds.""  
  
""Please respect our call and sign us up for the college prep program.""  
  
Kai nodded in agreement.  
  
His gaze fell on my blank application, and a cruel smile played at his lips.  
  
""Ms. Rodriguez, don't tell me someone's been whispering in your ear, trying to pressure us into applying to college?""  
  
""We're not interested in Columbia.""  
  
""And we're especially not interested in anyone who wants to go there.""  
  
The words hit like a physical blow.  
  
I hadn't done anything wrong, yet shame burned through me, my cheeks blazing red.  
  
They finished their paperwork and bolted from the room.  
  
Obviously desperate to find Scarlett.  
  
In my past life, even when my water broke in the back of a taxi, they'd never moved with such urgency.  
  
I swallowed the bitter taste of heartbreak.  
  
After several deep breaths, I managed to speak.  
  
""Ms. Rodriguez, I won't be applying either.""  
  
She looked ready to explode.  
  
""This is ridiculous!""  
  
""I've seen you carving Columbia's logo into your desk!""  
  
""Just because these two idiots won't go to college with you doesn't mean you should throw away your dreams!""  
  
The unexpected kindness made my throat tight with emotion.  
  
I shook my head quickly.  
  
""College here isn't my only option.""  
  
""My aunt lives in London. She's already secured me a spot at Cambridge.""  
  
""Please... don't tell them where I'm going.""  
  
They wanted a different life.  
  
Fine. I'd burn every bridge between us and never look back.  
  
From this moment on, we were nothing to each other.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Word spread fast around campus.  
  
Soon everyone knew I wasn't going to college either.  
  
At the graduation farewell party, classmates whispered among themselves.  
  
""Wait, don't Kai and Jaxon like Winter? But they're taking a gap year for Scarlett instead!""  
  
""I guess that proves Scarlett's better than Winter. Those two are like, every girl's dream guys—their standards must be sky-high!""  
  
""And Winter's not applying anywhere either? That's so pathetic. What kind of girl throws herself at guys like that?""  
  
Each word felt like a knife twisting in my chest.  
  
But I kept my head down, saying nothing.  
  
Scarlett sat on a small stool nearby, giggling sweetly.  
  
Kai and Jaxon flanked her, taking turns cracking jokes to make her laugh.  
  
Her laughter wasn't even that loud.  
  
But it felt like it was piercing straight through my eardrums.  
  
In my past life, after Dad died, I fell into a deep depression. The doctor told my loved ones to tell me jokes, help ease the pain.  
  
But until the day I died, they never told me a single one.  
  
Now here was Kai, gazing at her adoringly.  
  
""Scarlett, you should smile more.""  
  
Jaxon chimed in tenderly.  
  
""I'll help bring your grades up step by step. I promise you'll have a bright future.""  
  
""Seeing you smile—that's all I need to feel at peace.""  
  
So they did know how to tell jokes. They just never wanted to waste the effort on me.  
  
I clutched the yearbook I'd meant to give them, unable to bring myself to hand it over.  
  
How pathetic, really.  
  
I was moving to Cambridge, and I still wanted to take their messages with me as some kind of keepsake for the rest of my life.  
  
I couldn't blame myself for being lovesick.  
  
The feelings from my past life ran too deep.  
  
Back then, they'd brought me meals in all kinds of weather, stayed up all night when I had fevers.  
  
Scarlett glanced back at me with a mocking smile.  
  
""Winter, aren't you repeating senior year? Why are you handing out yearbooks?""  
  
""Trying to find an excuse to talk to them?""  
  
Kai's eyes turned ice-cold.  
  
""Give it up. I'm not signing that thing.""  
  
Jaxon remained expressionless, then loosened up slightly.  
  
""I guess we could write something.""  
  
""On one condition—you give Scarlett all your study notes.""  
  
With their photographic memories, they never took notes.  
  
So my three years of carefully compiled notes would become Scarlett's tool for quick grade improvement.  
  
Bitterness flooded my heart.  
  
But I nodded without showing any emotion.  
  
""Sure, you can borrow them. The notes won't do me any good anymore.""  
  
""But don't bother signing the yearbook.""  
  
They frowned in confusion.  
  
""You're actually agreeing?""  
  
I'd always been someone who didn't let people take advantage of me. There was no way I'd just hand things over to someone I disliked.  
  
But this time I'd agreed so readily.  
  
Jaxon suddenly laughed coldly.  
  
""Why bother acting all high and mighty?""  
  
""At the end of the day, you just want any excuse to get close to us, right? Fine, we'll give you what you want.""  
  
They snatched my yearbook away.  
  
Both wrote very brief entries, just signing their names under the ""Like"" and ""Dislike"" columns.  
  
Like—Scarlett.  
  
Dislike—Winter.  
  
Those few light words hung over my head like a blade. I unconsciously clenched the paper so tight—nails dug so deep into my palm, blood stained the words.  
  
Seeing my face go pale as a sheet, Kai and Jaxon exchanged triumphant smiles.  
  
Then they leaned over to whisper in Scarlett's ear, telling her what they'd written.  
  
Scarlett burst into laughter, tears of mirth streaming down her face.  
  
""You two are so mean!""  
  
""Oh, Winter—I'm going on a graduation trip with them tomorrow. Drop those notes off at my house, okay?""  
  
In my past life, when my depression made me want to go out and walk around for some fresh air, I'd begged them to travel with me. They had nothing going on but claimed they were too busy.  
  
This life, they were giving Scarlett everything they'd denied me.  
  
Bone-deep coldness spread through my heart.  
  
I suddenly felt like this was all so pointless.  
  
After they walked away, I threw the yearbook in the trash without hesitation.  
  
The things you beg for and can never get will someday become worthless.  
  
For the entire month that followed, Kai and Jaxon made a point of taking Scarlett to Boston, Chicago, San Francisco—all the major cities.  
  
The plan was for her to pick whichever city she liked, then they'd work their asses off to get her into a prestigious university there next year.  
  
From then on, they'd spend their lives taking care of her, just like they had with me in my previous life.  
  
When I first heard these rumors, my heart ached endlessly.  
  
But after hurting for so long, I went numb.  
  
Instead, I threw myself into preparing for the SAT Subject Tests and getting my student visa sorted for the UK.  
  
Thanks to my relentless effort, my application got approved, and several top British universities extended offers.  
  
On the first day of the college prep program, I grabbed my plane ticket and packed my bags.  
  
I'd just locked my door and was about to leave when Kai and Jaxon came marching toward me, looking pissed.  
  
I tried to avoid them.  
  
But Kai blocked my path, eyeing my luggage.  
  
""So you're running late for the first day because you were waiting for us to carry your bags to the dorm?""  
  
""Winter, could you be any more pathetically delusional?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I clenched my clothes tight.  
  
Not wanting to cause a scene and miss my flight, I simply asked:  
  
""What do you want?""  
  
Jaxon hurled a thick notebook at me.  
  
""You know damn well what you did!""  
  
""The whole thing's crossed out with red pen—not a single page is readable!""  
  
""Ruining the notes is one thing, but why the hell did you write 'bitch' and 'slut' all over it!""  
  
A sharp pain shot through me.  
  
I rubbed my shoulder, wincing, and flipped through the notebook.  
  
My expression turned cold, heart filled with resignation.  
  
""She staged this whole thing herself. What's it got to do with me?""  
  
What a hopeless case.  
  
A perfectly good study guide turned into her tool for playing victim and marking territory.  
  
Right as I finished speaking,  
  
Scarlett's pitiful voice piped up.  
  
""Kai, Jaxon, I didn't...""  
  
""I don't know what I did wrong to make Winter treat me like this.""  
  
""I've never been humiliated like this in my life. I can't even eat—how am I supposed to study?""  
  
Kai was shaking with rage.  
  
""Get on your knees and apologize!""  
  
""Then go to the school broadcast station and confess what you did in front of everyone!""  
  
Jaxon tossed me a pen.  
  
""And you're writing a guarantee!""  
  
""If you screw up Scarlett's college entrance exams, you forfeit your right to go to college!""  
  
My fingernails dug deep into my palms.  
  
Fighting back my anger, I said:  
  
""I already gave that up.""  
  
""Look closely—this is a 1 PM flight. I'm going abroad for college.""  
  
Kai frantically grabbed the plane ticket from my hands.  
  
""Abroad?""  
  
Both of them scrutinized it, their eyes filled with shock and disbelief.  
  
""Holy shit, it's real...""  
  
I snatched it right back.  
  
""If you don't mind, please don't mess with my future.""  
  
I noticed Scarlett looking a bit deflated.  
  
Soon enough, Kai's face returned to its cold mask.  
  
""Never thought you'd get this jealous.""  
  
""Showing up late on purpose to make me come find you, then pulling out a plane ticket to force me to leave Scarlett and chase after you instead.""  
  
Jaxon had his eureka moment too, sneering:  
  
""Going abroad, huh? Nobody's stopping you.""  
  
""Give it three days and you'll come crawling back home. Don't come crying to me.""  
  
I ignored them completely.  
  
Didn't even spare them a glance.  
  
Just rushed to flag down a bus and hopped on.  
  
Through the transparent window,  
  
I caught a glimpse of them looking at Scarlett with something different in their eyes.  
  
Different how?  
  
I couldn't tell, and I didn't care to figure it out.  
  
Not having to analyze their feelings anymore—what a relief.  
  
Seriously, I was capable and strong.  
  
Soon, I adapted to life at Cambridge quickly.  
  
Every day brought new challenges and excitement.  
  
News from back home barely reached my ears.  
  
I almost forgot.  
  
Forgot that there were once two men who'd consumed my thoughts, men I'd begged to see again in my dying breath.  
  
Until Christmas, a few months later.  
  
An international package arrived at my apartment.  
  
When I opened it, it was that yearbook I'd thrown in the trash.  
  
All the stains had been carefully cleaned off, and it even smelled of my favorite pine incense.  
  
As for those mocking words about me—they'd been scraped away with a blade.  
  
In their place were two lines written in elegant handwriting:  
  
\[Cambridge, heavy snow.\]  
  
\[You always get sick when seasons change—stay warm.\]  
  
My name had ""winter"" in it, but I hated the cold most of all.  
  
Back when I was starting my business, living in a drafty rental during winter, Jaxon would rush over to patch up the gaps, then always warm up a hot water bottle for me.  
  
He used to say, ""Winter, I'll always be by your side. I won't let you freeze.""  
  
Thinking of this, I lowered my eyes.  
  
After a moment's thought, I lit a match and burned the yearbook to ash.  
  
It had already become trash.  
  
No point trying to restore it to perfect condition now.  
  
I thought that would be the end of it.  
  
A few days later, another international call came through.  
  
It was Kai's voice.  
  
""Are you... doing okay?""  
  
""If you're really not, I wouldn't mind if you came back.""  
  
I just shook my head.  
  
My voice was completely flat.  
  
""Whether I'm good or bad—what's that to you?""  
  
""Please don't interfere with my life, okay?""  
  
Kai paused, his tone getting frantic and distorted.  
  
""Look, you're just pissed I chose Scarlett instead of going to Columbia with you, right?""  
  
""If I promise you I will, would you come back?""

My cousin (25F) has basically been semi-living at my place for like two weeks. She says it’s “temporary” because her flatmates are toxic or whatever, but she’s made herself real comfortable using all my hot water, killing my snacks, watching my shows like it’s her house.

I’ve been letting it slide. But yesterday just tipped me.

I’d bought a few things I actually like snacks, drinks, some random jar of garlic pickles I found at this small place across town. I didn’t hide them or anything, but I also didn’t offer them. She knew they were mine.

I come home, she’s sprawled on the couch, watching something on a free movie app I gave her, eating the last of those pickles with her feet on my coffee table.

I was like, “Seriously? That was mine.”
And she just goes, “You’re so possessive, chill out.”

She gets up and goes to take a shower. At that point I’d had enough. I packed her stuff, knocked on the door, and told her she could dry off at her own damn place.

She came out in a towel yelling, but I didn’t budge. She left cussing and now the whole family’s acting like I threw her into the street for breathing wrong.

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

Chapter 2

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

Chapter 3

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.

Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.

But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.

My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.

I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!

My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.

After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.

Chapter 4

When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him.

After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice.

I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying:

""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview.""

""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again.

I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name:

""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group.""

He smiled:

""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""

I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief.

That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day.

At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said:

""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?""

""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today?

""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?""

""No, ma'am. Everything is clear.""

""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday.""

She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out.

I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me:

""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?""

This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked:

""Mel, what about Fred?""

""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. Friend, it's a new life for all three of us.""

I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said:

""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!""

I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good.

The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road.

We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center.

The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk.

I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me.

Chapter 5

I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president.

Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule.

""So you have a child. How old is he?"" she asked with a smile.

""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!""

""What's his name?""

""Peter.""

""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said:

""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush.""

I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare.

Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day.

Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon. I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice:

""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?""

I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice:

""Put Mariana on.""

I was startled but kept my composure and replied:

""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?""

""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently.

""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant.""

""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word.

""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?""

""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office.""

""Certainly, sir. And your name is?""

""Looks like I'm your boss!"" He snapped and hung up.

Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked:

""Was he calm?""

I looked at her and couldn't help myself:

""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck.""

She burst out laughing and then said:

""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it.""

I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!

Chapter 1  
  
Jake Harrison said he didn't want people thinking he was some sugar baby.  
  
So I happily kept our marriage secret for three years.  
  
At our department dinner, a female intern insisted we play her special card game.  
  
\[Straddle the opposite sex face-to-face and GRIND for ten seconds.\]  
  
She immediately picked Jake, giggling:  
  
""Do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Harrison?""  
  
After a pause, Jake shook his head while everyone made those knowing, dirty sounds.  
  
She instantly climbed on top of him, biting her lip and putting on quite the show.  
  
The whole time, she kept shooting me these smug looks.  
  
Then it was Jake's turn to draw.  
  
\[Make out with the nearest person of the opposite sex for thirty seconds.\]  
  
The intern was on his left. I was on his right.  
  
He hesitated. So did I.  
  
...  
  
The vibe in the VIP booth was absolutely wild, and I clutched my drink with sweaty palms.  
  
Three years of marriage, and Jake was clearly over me. Done. Finished.  
  
But just now? He couldn't keep his hands off River's tiny waist, staring at her like she was some kind of goddess or something.  
  
The vodka fumes were making my eyes burn, so I quickly ducked my head to hide the mess I was becoming.  
  
With everyone cheering them on, Jake leaned over and whispered:  
  
""Chill, it's just a stupid game. Don't be like that.""  
  
Then boom—he spun around, grabbed River's face, and went in for the kill.  
  
Someone literally squealed, and they finally came up for air looking all hot and bothered.  
  
Timer stopped at fifty-seven seconds.  
  
River licked her lips with this cat-that-ate-the-canary grin and slid the cards my way.  
  
That's when I noticed I'd practically drawn blood digging my nails into my palms.  
  
Jake grabbed my hand before I could draw a card, his voice ice-cold:  
  
""Yo, hold up—isn't our creative director married? This is kinda messed up, right?""  
  
The whole team went full gossip mode, eyes practically bugging out: ""Wait, WHAT? Who bagged our ice queen boss lady?""  
  
I stayed quiet, shot Jake this bitter-ass smile, and said:  
  
""Yep, guilty as charged. Three shots it is.""  
  
After I threw back the alcohol, River gave me this fake-sweet wink.  
  
""Aww, sorry hun, but married people can't play our little games. If you're not having fun, there's the door.""  
  
Jake just sat there like a damn statue, acting like she wasn't talking about him too.  
  
I snatched my phone and practically ran, my heart doing this weird breaking-apart thing.  
  
The party was still going strong behind me.  
  
I collapsed against the wall outside, catching pieces of River's voice floating through the door.  
  
""But for real though, who the hell would want to tap that? She's boring as hell. I bet she knows like, two positions max.""  
  
""Her poor husband probably wanted out before the honeymoon was over.""  
  
Everyone lost it laughing, and then after this awful pause, Jake's voice cut through:  
  
""Yeah, pretty much.""  
  
Those three words sucker-punched me so hard I couldn't breathe. Ice shot up from my feet straight to my heart.  
  
So he'd been done with me all along.  
  
I threw my head back, swallowed the tears, and dialed a divorce attorney.  
  
Got home to our pathetically empty house and just sat there staring at nothing. Then I wandered into Jake's room like some kind of masochist.  
  
We'd been doing the whole separate bedrooms thing for two years now—basically glorified roommates who split the mortgage.  
  
His room was pristine. No surprises there.  
  
I was about to bail when this fancy little gift box on his desk caught my eye.  
  
Jake wasn't exactly Mr. Romance—besides my engagement ring, the guy had never bought me so much as a coffee.  
  
Curiosity killed the cat, so I popped it open and just... froze.  
  
It was that Tiffany necklace I'd been stalking online for months but couldn't justify dropping two grand on.  
  
Even more stunning in person.  
  
And then it hit me like a brick—tomorrow was my birthday.  
  
I ran my fingers over the necklace, watching it catch the light and throw off these gorgeous sparkles. For a hot second, my resolve started wavering.  
  
The lawyer texted asking if I could meet tomorrow to go over everything.  
  
After staring at my phone for like two seconds, I typed back: ""Let's do next week instead. No rush.""  
  
Jake didn't stumble in until one AM, absolutely wasted, wrapping me up in this sloppy hug while fishing a greasy bag from his coat.  
  
""You didn't eat dinner. You know you get hangry as hell.""  
  
I sighed and took the In-N-Out bag, steadying his drunk ass as we headed to his room.  
  
Right after I turned off the lights, his phone suddenly lit up.  
  
Video message from River. Something made me grab his phone and unlock it.  
  
What I saw made my blood turn to ice.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The hallway outside the bar. Jake had River pinned against the wall, going at it like the world was ending.  
  
The look in his eyes—pure fire, raw hunger. Stuff I'd never seen directed at me. Not once.  
  
I let out this hollow laugh. Yeah, some ""game.""  
  
Then the messages popped up:  
  
\[Ugh, I guess I'll survive being attacked by a horny caveman. You're welcome.\]  
  
\[Your little friend down there kept jabbing me the whole time. Seriously gross.\]  
  
My hands were shaking as I scrolled up, but everything above that was wiped clean.  
  
River had started at our company two weeks ago as Jake's intern.  
  
Drop-dead gorgeous and shameless about flaunting it. Different barely-there outfit every day, serving main character energy to everyone she met.  
  
I'd caught guys sneaking photos, so I pulled her aside about professional dress code and tore those creeps new ones.  
  
She nodded like butter wouldn't melt, then turned around and called me a ""bitter old hag"" to those same guys.  
  
When I asked Jake what he thought about River, he barely looked up:  
  
""She's twenty-two, she wants to look cute. Not like she's gonna dress like someone pushing thirty.""  
  
Then he shot me this pointed look.  
  
""Moe, you're being jealous and petty. Can't handle someone else getting attention.""  
  
That shut me right up.  
  
Looking back, I should've seen the writing on the wall. He was already gone.  
  
Next morning, Jake barged into my office looking ready to murder someone and slammed River's evaluation papers on my desk.  
  
""Are you kidding me right now? All this over some party drama?""  
  
""You realize you could actually tank her career because you're throwing a tantrum?""  
  
The papers scattered everywhere. I swallowed the lump in my throat, gathered them up, and said evenly:  
  
""The evaluation reflects her actual performance. If you have concerns, take it up with HR.""  
  
When I didn't cave, Jake's tone shifted, going all smooth and manipulative:  
  
""Come on, you know what it's like being a woman in this business.""  
  
""And it's her birthday today. She was so excited, now she's a complete mess because of you.""  
  
When I still didn't respond, he leaned forward:  
  
""Just say you're sorry, promise her a decent review next month. Think of it as a birthday gift.""  
  
""If you're worried about looking weak in front of the team, I'll bring her here privately.""  
  
Jake hadn't tried this hard to convince me of anything in years.  
  
Before I could tell him to go to hell, he was already ushering in a red-eyed River.  
  
River immediately latched onto his arm like some wounded deer, bottom lip trembling perfectly on cue.  
  
That's when I spotted the necklace glittering at her throat. The same damn one from his room.  
  
My chest felt like someone had punched a hole through it. I actually started laughing—couldn't stop myself. What a complete joke I'd been.  
  
I took a long sip of coffee to steady my voice:  
  
""River, maybe spend less time crying and more time not being terrible at your job. Your campaign ideas are absolutely tragic.""  
  
Her waterworks kicked into overdrive as she shrieked:  
  
""You're just jealous because I'm young and gorgeous! You're trying to ruin my life!""  
  
Then she stormed out, slamming the door so hard the whole office shook.  
  
Suddenly everyone was covering their mouths, whispering and side-eyeing me like I'd just kicked a puppy.  
  
Jake's face went dark: ""Moe, you're really disappointing me right now.""  
  
And just like that, he bolted after her.  
  
I clenched my fists, shut my door, and buried every emotion deep down while I got back to work.  
  
Right before five, River posted in the group chat about her birthday dinner tonight—her treat, everyone welcome.  
  
The chat exploded with ""Happy birthday!"" messages. Jake sent ninety-nine of them. I counted.  
  
All the tears I'd been holding back finally came crashing down, hitting my paperwork like fat raindrops.  
  
Jake texted me:  
  
\[River doesn't have a ride. Gonna drop her off at the restaurant. Just head home without me.\]  
  
I typed and deleted a message like ten times before finally hitting send.  
  
One last roll of the dice.  
  
\[It's my birthday too, you know.\]  
  
Five whole minutes passed before he responded:  
  
\[Shit, sorry. If you'd mentioned it earlier I totally would've done something, but I already promised River.\]  
  
\[What do you want? I'll grab you something on my way back.\]  
  
I pulled up the blinds and watched our whole team parade out with River at the center like some kind of queen bee.  
  
Jake stood next to her grinning like an idiot, holding this massive bouquet of roses and a bunch of fancy gift bags.  
  
They looked like the perfect couple getting showered with congratulations.  
  
Meanwhile, I was hiding in the shadows like some dirty secret.  
  
\[Don't worry about it. I'll just grab something myself.\]  
  
I waited until the lobby was completely empty before wiping my eyes and heading home.  
  
Sitting there with those divorce papers in my lap, this awful bitter feeling settled in my chest.  
  
I figured I'd wait for Jake to get back so we could talk about splitting up.  
  
Instead, River showed up at my door.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""She got cornered by some creep right outside her place. I had no choice but to bring her back here.""  
  
""Poor kid just graduated—she can't afford anything safe. Let's just let her crash with us for a while.""  
  
I leaned against the doorframe, saying nothing, just watching River sob into his chest like some wounded bird.  
  
""When did you become so damn petty?"" Jake snapped, letting out this bitter laugh. ""Oh right, someone like you would never deal with this kind of shit. Can't relate, huh?""  
  
I turned around and shut the door behind me.  
  
Thing is, I was broke as hell when I first graduated too. Lived in this sketchy neighborhood where rent was dirt cheap.  
  
Total war zone—dealers, addicts, you name it. Two people got murdered there in one month.  
  
Every night after work, I'd grip a box cutter in my pocket just to make it upstairs alive.  
  
Even being that careful, some psycho still picked my lock one night.  
  
Lucky for me, I had nightmares all the time and kept scissors under my pillow. That's the only reason I didn't get raped or worse.  
  
Predators don't give a damn what you look like when they want to hurt you.  
  
I could hear Jake's voice through the wall, all soft and gentle as he comforted River.  
  
It reminded me of three years ago when he used to talk to me like that.  
  
During that crazy flood—once-in-a-century storm that trapped me in the underground garage.  
  
Water was up to my neck, bodies floating past me. I was screaming for help, choking on nasty floodwater.  
  
Right when I thought I was done for, Jake appeared out of nowhere and grabbed my hand, dragging us both toward higher ground.  
  
""Hang on! We're gonna make it out of this!""  
  
But I was totally spent. He kept falling trying to pull me along.  
  
I was crying, telling him: ""Just go! Leave me here!""  
  
He wouldn't listen. Gritted his teeth and hauled me onto his back.  
  
""Moe, if we die, we die together.""  
  
After we made it out, I completely lost it, sobbing in his arms right there on the street. He just smiled and said:  
  
""Guess we're ride-or-die now.""  
  
That's how we ended up together. Dating, then married.  
  
Funny thing is, looking back, I don't think Jake ever actually said he loved me.  
  
River was sleeping in his room—the same room he never let me into anymore.  
  
When I opened my bedroom door, he was sitting on the couch like he'd been waiting forever.  
  
""River's pretty shaken up. She needs someone with her.""  
  
""She's not comfortable around you, and you know I can't sleep in strange places,"" he said, hesitating. ""So... could you maybe grab a hotel room tonight?""  
  
Logical and completely insane at the same time.  
  
I stared at him, my throat tight: ""Sure.""  
  
I left the signed divorce papers on the table and quickly packed my stuff.  
  
On my way out, Jake was in the kitchen making River some honey tea.  
  
Watching the steam rise from the mug, I smiled this empty smile and couldn't help myself:  
  
""You need to use warm water, not hot.""  
  
He had this ""duh"" moment and dumped out the scalding water, muttering thanks without even looking at me.  
  
You're welcome, I thought.  
  
Three years of marriage, and he'd never cooked me a single meal or made me one cup of honey tea.  
  
Guess the difference between love and obligation is pretty obvious.  
  
When he carried the mug back to the bedroom, he noticed my suitcase.  
  
""Damn, you're taking a lot of stuff.""  
  
""I need to take care of River, so I won't walk you out.""  
  
I glanced at the pitch-black night outside and nodded like I understood.  
  
I waited in that hotel room for hours. Jake never called—probably too busy playing nurse.  
  
Which meant he never saw those divorce papers.  
  
Next afternoon, passing by the break room, I caught some office gossip.  
  
""They're totally hooking up. And living together now.""  
  
""I've been shipping them forever. That necklace River's wearing? Jake bought it. I looked it up—like fifteen grand.""  
  
""Someone saw them making out at her birthday party last night.""  
  
Rain started pounding against the windows, and my chest felt like someone was squeezing my heart until it burst.  
  
I stumbled back to my office, shaking uncontrollably.  
  
That flood left me with serious PTSD. Heavy rain still sends me into complete panic mode.  
  
Ten minutes later, Jake rushed in and locked the door, pulling me into his arms.  
  
""Hey, it's okay. Storm's almost over.""  
  
He automatically reached for my anxiety meds in the desk drawer, but the bottle was empty.  
  
""Hold tight, I'll grab your prescription.""  
  
He never came back.  
  
My assistant texted:  
  
\[River's having bad cramps. Jake took her to the ER and called in sick.\]  
  
I pressed my shaking hands flat on the desk and typed back: \[Thanks.\]  
  
Rush hour traffic meant no Ubers, and I was too messed up to drive. So I just huddled in my office waiting.  
  
Around eight, I finally got a ride. But I was so out of it, I forgot to change the address.  
  
The driver dropped me off at my old place—the house was all lit up.  
  
The moment I walked in, I heard sounds from the guest room. Sounds that made everything crystal clear.  
  
I dragged myself down the hallway and saw two bodies tangled together, clothes scattered everywhere.  
  
Turns out when pain hits that level, you just go numb.  
  
River wasn't having cramps. And Jake definitely wasn't the cold, distant guy I'd been married to.

## Key Features Analysis

The longevity and aesthetic appeal of a moss table runner depend largely on it's materials and construction.

**Type of Moss:** Many runners utilize preserved or stabilized moss,ensuring they remain green and retain their texture without requiring watering or direct sunlight. Others may use artificial moss, which offers durability and ease of cleaning but may lack the natural appearance of preserved moss. Preserved moss is naturally derived and will vary in texture and color while artificial moss is created using synthetic materials.

The type of moss used is crucial for both the look and maintenance of the runner. Preserved moss runners will be naturally soft and will have a realistic element. This natural element will deteriorate quicker than synthetic moss. Runners will typically use sphagnum moss and sheet moss given the wide availability and easy application for those types.**Base Material:** The moss is typically adhered to a base material, such as burlap, felt, or a flexible plastic mesh. Burlap creates a rustic and natural look, while felt provides a softer and more even surface. A plastic mesh offers durability and allows for better drainage if the runner is exposed to moisture.

The base offers structure to the moss runner. Without quality base and adhesives, the moss will lack any real stability and may shed. Choosing the correct base allows for the moss to adhere firmly and keep its integrity over time.**Size and dimensions:** Moss table runners are available in various lengths and widths to accommodate different table sizes. Common lengths range from 48 inches to 96 inches, while widths typically vary between 10 inches and 16 inches. These dimensions are crucial for ensuring the runner fits appropriately on your table and contributes to the overall aesthetic.

Dimensions will depend on use case scenario in general. smaller more dense tables will typically use a smaller runner while large catering tables may need extended length. width is of importance to ensure there is adequate coverage given the table and the added layers on top.

**Preservation Process (for Preserved Moss):** The quality of the preservation process directly affects the runner's longevity and appearance.High-quality preservation involves gentle drying and treatment with non-toxic preservatives to maintain the moss's color and texture. Inferior preservation techniques can result in fading, brittleness, and a shorter lifespan.

High quality preservation methods are vital in extending the usable lifespan of the moss. Preserved moss is exposed to an intricate chemical process that replaces the natural moisture with chemical moisture. The better preserved moss is, the more natural and realistic it will appear.

Key features of the moss runner include:

*   Authentic natural appearance
*   Durable construction and materials
*   Variety of sizes and styles
*   Low maintenance requirements

They can be paired with different decor elements, such as candles, flowers, and natural stones, to create unique and personalized displays.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean and maintain a moss table runner?**
For preserved moss runners, avoid direct sunlight and moisture.Dust gently with a soft brush or use a can of compressed air to remove debris. For artificial moss runners, wipe them down with a damp cloth and mild soap if necessary. Avoid submerging either type in water.

**can I customize the size and shape of a moss table runner?**
Customization options vary depending on the retailer or manufacturer. Some sellers offer custom sizes to fit specific table dimensions. You can also trim or alter the runner yourself using sharp scissors or a craft knife, but be careful not to damage the moss or base material.

**Are moss table runners suitable for outdoor use?**
Preserved moss runners are generally not recommended for extended outdoor use, as exposure to sunlight and moisture can degrade the moss over time. Artificial moss runners are more durable and suitable for outdoor settings but should still be protected from extreme weather conditions to prolong their lifespan.

**What is the expected lifespan of a moss table runner?**
With proper care, a preserved moss runner can last several years, maintaining its color and texture. Artificial moss runners can last even longer, often 5-10 years or more, depending on the quality of materials and usage.

1l8pi27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l8pi27/30f_34m_after_7_months_of_the_deepest_emotional/,"30F 34M After 7 months of the deepest emotional and spiritual connection, he told me he loved me… then disappeared.","Hi Reddit, I’d appreciate some outside perspective on a confusing and emotionally painful situation I’m going through. I’m not looking to place blame, just trying to understand what happened and figure out how to move forward.

I (30F) met this guy (34M) about 7 months ago. The very first time we met was in person at a bar. We had a natural connection that night, and afterward, we added each other on social media and stayed in light contact for a while, just casual messaging.

Around that time, he started seeing another woman (non-exclusively), which he was honest with me about. Meanwhile, he and I would occasionally hang out in a platonic way — park walks, gym classes, just friendly connection. Once that other situation ended, he and I gradually became more intimate.

At first, it was clearly sexual. We weren’t having deep conversations and we kept it light. But then we started getting a little more involved in each other’s lives — sending voice notes, videos, and pictures of what we were doing. We were in regular contact. It felt close.

2 months later, some feelings started to surface — and that’s when he pulled away. He told me that he wasn’t comfortable with the fact that I’m a single mom to a four-year-old girl. He said it gently, but clearly. So we ended things and went no contact.

A few weeks later, I reached out to get my wallet and briefcase back. His response was cold and defensive — he said he was already planning to return them and suggested he drops them off without contact as he took my request to be blunt and cold. I suggested we stay mature, and a quick coffee meetup, and after that, he re-initiated contact over social media. We slowly re-engaged, and eventually became sexual again.

This time, things deepened. Our sex life was passionate and connected (we both expressed it was the best we’ve had), but more than that, we began having late-night conversations, emotional openness, and real trust. He’d say things like, “You see me,” “You’re so real,” “You make me feel safe.”

Fast forward, 3 months later, he invited me on a 10-day trip to Italy. On that trip, our bond became even deeper — emotionally, physically, and spiritually. We spent nearly every moment together. We had two small arguments (our first ever), and he told me afterward how much he respected my calmness and emotional maturity and that he was not used to that from past relationships. He said he respects that I’m a mom and that’s why I have my priorities straight and that he wouldn’t change anything about me.

We also connected spiritually in a way I’ve never experienced before. We spoke about energy, personal growth, consciousness, healing — it felt like we were mirrors to each other. It was deep and grounding and completely unlike any dynamic I’ve had before. When I say it was intense, I don’t say it lightly… 

Before that trip (not right before, but a few weeks earlier), I told him I loved him — not in a romantic, “I’m in love” way, but just that I loved him as a person. I downplayed it because I was scared of being vulnerable, especially since I’ve never told a man that first. He didn’t say it back at the time — but after the trip, he told me he loved me. He said I was the most special woman he’d ever met. That I was rare. That I needed to be protected and my heart is very kind and big.

He also started talking about making our relationship public, introducing me to his family, taking more trips together. He invited me to his family home (he still lives with his family, but his parents were away, so it was just his sister and her fiancé). He said he was thinking of asking me to be his girlfriend.

But even with all that, he kept hesitating. The thing that kept coming up was that I have a child — and an ex. Even though I reassured him again and again that he’d never have to carry any financial or emotional burden, that my daughter already has a present and loving father, and that my ex and I are very amicable — he still couldn’t get past it.

He told me that if we were to continue seriously, he’d need a right to co-parent. That he couldn’t accept a situation where another man was still involved in the background. He described it as a “power play” — that he couldn’t be okay with stepping into a life that was already formed.

Then, just before a trip he had planned to Australia, he came over and brought up the girlfriend label again. He said he thought he’d be ready after our last weekend, but he wasn’t. He said he needed space during the trip. He still wanted to stay in touch, be flirty, have phone sex, etc. But something felt off. 

After we were intimate that night, I told him I hadn’t been emotionally present — that the ambiguity was getting to me. I explained that for me, exclusivity isn’t a heavy commitment — it’s just about mutual respect. He said he felt pressured. He left suddenly.

The next day, he messaged me saying that everything had moved too fast emotionally, and he wasn’t ready for this journey. He said I was taking away his chance to experience firsts — like having a child, holidays, travels — with someone new alone without a child. That it was too much, and he needed to step back. Even though a week before, he was so sure and that he said I’m so worth it and we both are financially capable and have the resources to make this work out. 

I told him I understood, even though I was heartbroken. That was over 10 days ago. Since then — total silence. No texts, no social media. It’s like he vanished. From “I love you” and “you’re rare” to absolutely nothing.

I’m not here to ask if he’s a bad person or to blame anyone. I just feel really destabilized by the emotional whiplash. We had something that felt profound — emotionally, spiritually, physically. And I’m trying to understand:
	•	How could someone go from so emotionally present and completely head over heels with you to completely disconnected overnight?
	•	Could this be a case of emotional avoidance?
	•	Is the child/ex dynamic really the issue — or just a surface-level excuse for deeper fears?

He also still has my belongings and won’t be back from his travels for another week. They’re replaceable things, but should I still ask for them back?

I figured I'd come to Reddit to ask since I don't really know who to talk to about this and this is my first post here so I hope I written it ok.

So for context, I (M29) have been dating my gf(26) for 2 years now. 

For added info just so you can understand the full picture. I've only been in one previous relationship which lasted around 8 and a half years. It ended out of the blue by my ex just telling me she had found someone else and went no contact with me. That sent me to a dark place and it took me a couple of years to fully bounce back from. During that period I became good friends with a female coworker. She recently came out of a relationship which ended due to cheating so we kind of bonded over that. It was purely platonic. She was the one that encouraged me to get back out there and start dating again which really helped. We became good friends and started to hang out regularly outside of work grabbing coffees or whatever. We both moved to different jobs and started meeting up less.

Then I met my gf and we hit it off. We really connected and quickly grew close. 

The trouble started around three months ago when I was showing her a meme that a friend sent me. Then I backed onto my messages. At the very bottom she saw my old co workers name and for context we haven't spoken in over a year. I will take full responsibility cause this is were I could have really handled things better. Firstly, the co worker never came up not that I was hiding anything but it just never came up or I thought to say which I completely understand her reaction. Secondly, if I'm honest my gf can be rather jealous at times and I knew this was about to explode into something far bigger so I tried to downplay it by saying we only worked together. My gf grabbed my and started to go through it. When she say we would meet up for a coffee and hang out she saw red. When she came back down we talked about it.

It's kind of from hear that things have went downhill in terms of the relationship. She has went through my phone multiple times at this point and she believes nothing ever happened and it was completely platonic but she is struggling with me downplaying and presenting as something less. 

It's turned into an emotional rollercoaster and I'm struggling. One minute we are fine then the next she doesn't know if she wants to be together anymore. I've taken full accountability of how I've handled it and I'm trying my best but nothings working. She's also doing things that's really bringing up trauma from how my previous relationship ended. For example, she was asked out by a male coworker for drinks just the two of them as in a date and she told me she was tempted just to get back at me. We were also out at a birthday party and she kept looking at a guy who she eventually asked to dance with. She has told me in the past she has cheated on one of her ex's so I'm just struggling with it all. 

I genuinely want to be with her and it was amazing before this all happened. I'm just lost on what to do.

**Holter results:** 

HR average: 67bpm  
Min.: 46bpm

Max: 122bpm (while anxious)

No auricular fibrillation

A few ventricular and supraventricular ectopics that weren't considered important.

No significant pauses

**Stress test:**

Clinically and electrically negative.

No arrythmia.

**Medications:** 

* antihistamines 
* bronchodilator (salbutamol) when my seasonal allergies produce asthma 

No history of fainting and no family history of sudden cardiac arrest. We don't know yet if I'm the first family member that has it. The doctors seem to consider me asymptomatic. I've told them that I sometimes wake up abruptly with a feeling of suffocation that goes away quickly but they think this is probably unrelated and more likely to be sleep apnea.

I have a few questions I was hoping maybe someone could help me with:

1. Is the small risk of an elecrophysiologic study in which they test if it's easy to induce arrythmia through a catheter worth it to assess if I should get an ICD?
2. I've read that some people with Brugada carry a defibrilator with them. Should I get one too?
3. Considering that my risk is low to medium (at least that's the impression I got from the doctors), would getting an ICD anyways be a good idea for the peace of mind or do the risks outweigh the benefit at this moment?
4. Besides avoiding the medications that are on this list [https://www.brugadadrugs.org/](https://www.brugadadrugs.org/) , should I also avoid things like coffee? Cannabis is listed as well but I've only seen reports about THC. Is CBD as dangerous?

1l8pdhy,https://i.redd.it/icklhsif1a6f1.jpeg,Kendu Is Multichain Opportunity,"

Cryptocurrency is often seen as a space full of hype, high risk, and speculation. But every so often, a project comes along that offers something different. Kendu is one of those rare examples.

What started as a simple memecoin has evolved into a growing brand with real-world products, services, and a passionate community. With a market cap around $27 million, Kendu is still in its early stages, which makes now a strong entry point for everyday investors looking to get involved with a project that goes beyond internet jokes and charts.

⸻

Real Products You Can See, Use, and Trust

Unlike most crypto projects that exist only online, Kendu is taking bold steps into the physical world. The team and community behind Kendu are actively building real products and hosting real events, giving investors something to believe in beyond the token itself.

Here are some of the highlights:
	•	Kendu Entertainment is hosting glow-in-the-dark pickleball tournaments in India. These events have already attracted media attention and more social gatherings are in the works.
	•	A Kendu hot dog stand is launching soon in Florida, bringing the brand into the food space.
	•	Kendu Coffee, sourced from Brazil, is already available in both regular and decaf options.
	•	Kendu Organics just launched a line of chemical-free, all-natural body products.
	•	Kendu Beer is currently in development with a working prototype already completed.
	•	A line of Kendu vapes is also being prepared for future release.

Kendu is also expanding into lifestyle and entertainment:
	•	Kendu merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and caps are already circulating.
	•	Kendu pendants and plushies give fans physical collectibles that grow brand loyalty.
	•	A Kendu board game created by members of the community shows the creativity behind the project.
	•	The Kendu animation series released its first Japanese-style episode and is being expanded further.
	•	A Kendu video game is currently being built by professional developers with early previews already released.
	•	The Kendu Creator mask is a 3D-printable item for content creators who want to promote Kendu while remaining anonymous.

These real-world assets demonstrate that Kendu is not just a cryptocurrency. It is a growing consumer brand.

⸻

A Community That Truly Believes

What makes Kendu unique is its community. Unlike typical token holders waiting for price movements, Kendu holders actively participate in growing the brand. This includes creating art, running pop-up stands, and even getting Kendu tattoos. Some investors have literally made Kendu a part of themselves, which speaks volumes about the commitment and excitement surrounding the project.

The Kendu Street Team has already appeared at three major festivals in Florida. They hand out energy drinks, free merchandise, and paint murals that help raise brand awareness.

On social media, Kendu is everywhere. From Reddit and Twitter to TikTok and Instagram, the brand’s visibility is increasing rapidly. This digital reach is backed by real community activity, not paid influencers or empty marketing campaigns.

Kendu is also the second crypto project in history to receive 50,000 Certik votes for a free audit, following only PEPE. It also holds a community rating of 98 out of 100 on Certik, which is one of the highest trust scores in the entire space.

⸻

Building Trust Through Real-World Presence

Crypto has suffered from broken promises, scams, and celebrity-driven projects that quickly disappear. This has left many everyday investors unsure about which projects to trust.

Kendu offers something different. By showing up in the real world through food stands, coffee, games, events, and health products, it proves it is more than just a digital token. Investors can actually see what their money is supporting. That kind of visibility builds trust and shows commitment from the people behind the project.

In simple terms, investing in Kendu feels less like buying a coin and more like supporting the early growth of a lifestyle brand. Think of it as getting in on the ground floor of something like Red Bull or Nike, but with a modern twist and the power of blockchain behind it.

⸻

Why Now Is the Right Time

Kendu is still in its early growth phase. With a market cap around $27 million and expanding product lines, the potential for future gains is strong. The brand has already proven it can build, engage, and deliver. Now, it is focused on scaling and gaining wider recognition.

For investors looking to get involved in a project that blends culture, community, and commerce, Kendu presents a rare opportunity. It is fun, creative, and most importantly, real.

This is more than a meme. It is a movement. And you still have time to be part of it.

These apps, you will let you judge and choose your matches via their physical appearance. If you both swipe right you would match and be able to communicate. (My brother and my sister-in-law met via Bumble and they are living happily together in Europe)

But for Reddit, a forum. An app centered on text, topics and interests. You judge people on their comments and how they think, their mind. But ofc you are bound to exchange photos and I always ended up not liking how they look like. And the conversation ends there.

Of course I'm very careful and cautious in using these apps. People would ask for IG or TG. I tend not to give any of my socials. I am skeptical like that. As much as I don't like it I'm starting to become a public figure. 

But I find talking to strangers easier. I can talk to them about my problems because they don't know the people I'm talking about.

Should you just wait for the right person? Or should you continue seeking? I'm not getting any younger and you know how addicted I am to my 2nd work, I don't have time to flirt and find Mr. Right. If I look for love via my 2nd work, I would appear unprofessional or life is too short to think about what people perceive of me?

For now? I don't want to seek love via phone apps. I'd rather have someone I'm familiar with and confess their attraction. I dont trust new people easily.

I just returned from my second trip to your incredible city, and I’m still buzzing from how amazing it was. I wanted to take a moment to share how much Paris means to me and to thank everyone who makes it such a special place.

First of all, the people. Parisians, you are the soul of this city. I know there’s a stereotype out there about Paris being unfriendly, but that hasn’t been my experience at all. From the kind server who patiently helped me practice my French (*""Un café, s’il vous plaît"" -* I’m getting there!) to the stranger who pointed me in the right direction when I looked lost (*""C’est par là!""*), I’ve always felt welcomed here. There’s a quiet confidence and warmth in the way people carry themselves, and it makes the city feel alive in the best way.

And then there’s the city itself. Paris, you are breathtaking. Every corner feels like it’s straight out of a postcard, but in the most authentic way. The way the light hits the Seine in the evening (*la lumière est magnifique!*), the way the cobblestone streets seem to tell stories, the way the Eiffel Tower peeks out at you when you least expect it.. it’s all so magical. This time, I made sure to slow down and really soak it all in. I spent hours just wandering, letting myself get lost in the charm of your neighborhoods. *Flâner* might just be my new favorite word.

I’ve always been obsessed with fashion, and Paris is like the ultimate playground for that. The style here is so effortless, so *chic*. It’s not about trying too hard, it’s about owning who you are and looking good while doing it. I spent way too much time (and money) in Le Marais and Saint-Germain-des-Prés, but honestly, it was worth every penny. *C’est la vie!*

What I love most, though, is the lifestyle. There’s a rhythm to life here that feels so balanced. People take the time to enjoy their meals (*bon appétit!*), to sit and talk, to appreciate the little things. It’s such a refreshing change from the rush of everyday life back home. I’ll never forget the mornings I spent at a corner café, sipping coffee and watching the world go by. Or the evenings spent picnicking by the Seine, surrounded by laughter and music. *C’était parfait.*

This trip, I made it a point to explore beyond the usual spots, and I’m so glad I did. Canal Saint-Martin and Belleville were such gems, quieter, more local, but still so full of life. It reminded me that Paris isn’t just a city; it’s a collection of a million little moments and places, each with its own story.

So, to the people of Paris: *merci* for sharing your city with the world. To the city itself: *tu es magnifique.* And to anyone thinking about visiting: don’t hesitate. Paris has a way of staying with you long after you leave.

Later a police car stop them and they think they're screwed but a female police officer opens the trunk and finds a lightsaber and she starts laughing. Later when she releases them, as a gag she says ""may the force be with you"" and she holds the lightsaber as they leave the police station. In another scene you see them at a window of a coffee shop or cafe of some sort, and one of the waitresses asks them to come inside, after they tell her that they dont have any money she tells them to get their asses inside and they start eating pancakes and get a lot of food served. 
I remember in the ending that they successfully deliver the car to the destination and they smile and then a child gets the lightsaber from the trunk mentioned earlier and runs off.

And only microwaved in the actual place.

But the main point of selling would be that its cheap(and filling), since it would target mainly students and office workers. So the profit margins on it wouldnt be too great, hoping to even it more with sodas and deserts though, maybe a simple coffee machine too.

To do that i would need to cut costs wherever i could, so waste reduction would be a good place to do that.

So back to point, would 2 dishes per day(max 2 days in a row of the same menu) be too little? Or would people want variety all the time.

Based on the profit margins I've calculated i would also need to sell around 61 of the base lunch per day to break even, after that its profiting. Are these bad numbers?( this doesnt include a worker, it would be a one man show for a while, and based on testing, i could make 100 of these lunches per day. Like a bread maker, waking up at 3 am and cooking type thing.)

Im still in the very very very early phase, so im just looking for some advice from experienced people. Before i go around assesing my competition in the city.

I beleive espresso is 99% down to quality of the beans, the grind size and the tamp. That determines 99% of how good the espresso is. All these other extra steps are just added steps that have undescernable difference in taste.

I havent done any of these stuff though. Maybe ignorance is bliss, I'm happy with my espresso the way I'm making it and I dont want to make my coffee making a huge elongated task and just avoiding trying it.

Feels too personal and maybe contributed to my overall meltdown later. Not blaming anyone, my brain took a big hit when I was 7 or so, and it was pretty bad. I made sort of bad grades after and probably kinda spacier than normal but no one noticed. My grades improved and I switched schools at 6th grade , middle school away from all the friends made. (Didnt keep any so must notve been friends to begin with lol, foreshadowing…) but yeah I think the hit to my head made my life a bit less emotional than normal maybe… or unknown to me, I had been forcibly ripped of my foreskin when born, apparently it sells very high on the markets and valuable for research and Sandra Bullock🧴 anti aging lotion. So I had pains I didnt even realize. 

Like when my conservative stepdad kicked me out at 19 over my smoking habit. He smokes cigarettes so same thing basically. I took in way more throat and lung damage without filters though… but thats beside the point. Working in wet conditions at work after that, having to walk nearly 4 miles back and forth to work then run my ass off stocking overnights at Walmart. I was frozen dairy, and often cold and wet, without foreskin is a nightmare . Even now every time it gets even slightly cold sucks. 

To get to my story though starts in middle school again when I met this quiet kid after moving back from my other city to my hometown to my Elementary peers. He was new basically like me, (except i knew most of the class from my district, there was 1-2 other areas combined) He saw I was reading some fantasy and basically he had been reading the same series, Drizzt Do’Urden. He later got with a girl I briefly dated and they got pretty serious fast but she dumped him for idk what. Probably clingyness. (Which is why she also didnt like me after also.) I broke up with her but basically just felt like everything was pointless. I had already been smoking at that point, maybe 1 aluminum foil bowl too many (only did that once)  but anyway skip to 9th grade and still no one likes my friend. It was kinda crazy really. Just me and my old childhood friend and our mutual ex and a group he had known prior to this was at highschool (a summer camp,) so our list of allies was thin, except for me which seems like I was indifferent and everyone was to me also except a few crazy events. I had a lot of people telling me details of their lives too but never got to put any of it to use. … in fact it seemed like I had a crazy knack for giving good advice to people 

Aside####
(which they 100% of the time ignore, even to this day but not always.) Not saying Im always right, especially now I feel im slipping big time being crippled as I am. And just picked at my ear nervously and prob gonna lose hearing now in that ear for a while or permanently, keep scratching there fr its ridiculous. Anyway..
Had a brief encounter with one younger class lady I was trying to get with and she kept on and offing this curly haired brown eyed kid, I had heard a lot of details there too from her and other people but was so intimidated by her looks. Seriously, a 11/10 and probably into the brown eyed kid due to her genetics. Seemed partially Asian/ Caucasian hard to pinpoint but I also have a strong Asian background but also a dominant amount of Scotch and German type descent but people can prob tell I look stranger than avg, a real product of the melting pot. Native American on both sides and curly brown hair also…. But yeah, she’s not even important to the story.

More unimportant details… 1 and to many bong rips and wasted money/ potential later. (i knew about bitcoin in 2011, and had thousands to invest, can you imagine. I worked my ass off for that cash and wasted on overpriced herb hah, but thats avg Id guess. Stupid kid habits.) 
When I was working 2011 or so he brought a girl by from college, right after he had just broken up with his other gf of a year +… I literally was so ghost and overworked and smoked out at the time I dont even remember what she looked like at this time… funny cuz she’s gorgeous too. Id also put at 10/10 lmao… he gave me a bottle of whiskey. (We were of age.) which probably contributed to the memory loss

⏭️ skip
Its 2013 or so and my old friend from middle school and high school and summer camp (I also went one year.) and funny side story, I once tried to throw hands on a bully for messing with him (then the bully got in trouble, lost a bunch of weight and learned karate, no shit. He would’ve needed it against me. I was no pushover at 6’5” and 180 at the time (pre work muscles lol 💪 but i didnt snitch, just to note. I caused a big scene basically. Scary af. His short af friend circled me during it and couldve ball tapped me easily hah, i had my hands up innocently but not on guard during this altercation. 

My friend, he invites me to come chill and help his family start homesteading this land. I start living with them and practicing music and such. Theyre all musicians and I have had basic guitar lessons and basically come from a line of musicians and masons tbh… so musically talented. I can whistle darude Sandstorm 
Ok, cue the girl I met those few years before. “My gf is so hot. Check out her pictures or MySpace or whatever” moments and so yeah I expected a person I had zero shot with as usual… then this conversation maybe a day or so before she visited us at our little camp out in the wilderness happened. “Like yeah X is so good natured, and a lovely spirit, smart as fuck, spatial awareness out of this world, can cook, work ethic, and did I mention smoking gorgeous type , the only complaints I have are (redacted for him being mean here… this one made me sad about her body not being perfect and I disagree entirely even if the detail was factually true, i think its a jerk thing to note as negative.) and the other he says, “she seems too friendly, like with guys, like shes not gonna be loyal wife to me, yadda yadda. I just dont want to think she gives it to everyone. Please, I want you to sort of test her loyalty. Give it your all , being respectful, of course.” Sort of how I remember this. Which I translated into… this couple will not last at all… Im going to give it my best and pretend like they arent dating. Cuz like the bro code specifically forbids this and I was obviously defaulting to my default of not flirting with anyone lmao, I just tried to act normal as possible. Be friendly, make friends. Not focus on relationships… and Picked up a wine drinking habit here cuz they all drank wine… and coffee a little. So yea more brain points deducted.

They talked on the phone right before she arrived and said to him to tell me, “we were gonna be best friends.” Which i kinda laughed at, like yea right, this gonna go nowhere. Ended up calling it. But like ive been explaining, no one takes my advice. Not even me… i had a premonition of being attacked at the hospital after a violent guy attacked me the day before (however did I piece that one together.) I was too drugged up to complain to staff and they had kept lying saying I was refusing meds when they were just being kinda shady in general. Not giving me my meds, or Id oversleep. So yea, I got attacked in basketball 🏀 elbowed in my groin and ended up getting inguinal hernia and basically am always in pain now after surgery, and cant ever relax or straighten my legs out without pain and wake up from the nerve damage. Years before that 2017 my Uncle punched me in the eye for doing nothing and that still hurts slightly and hurt a lot for years with recurring pains. All because alcohol and how he doesnt like me. I was tortured by him all growing up and almost killed by his brother at one point choking me out. I was seeing stars and fading black when my grandma by luck got home and noticed fast I was almost dead. But Im trying to get to the real story. 

My stays at the hospital were ridiculous, and kinda showed me how fascist the government and life really is. Assaulted by security on entry and forced into a jail cell the day before that after coming in for serious insomnia. A nurse power tripped on my looking out my door and in my weakened state I freaked out trapped in the jail cell where I just wanted them to turn off the 3 giant lights since it was like 1am. They used that as an excuse to hold me for weeks and pump me full of obedience/ permanently mind altering drugs. Which admittedly a good trip for a little while. But as I pointed out earlier a weakness in that it shuts down greater consciousness.

I couldnt even snitch on a guy who attacked me (elbowed me in the jaw first. I have TMJ,” from that.) my code had reverted so much to a childish state (being sleep deprived also does this as well as emotional disconnection.
Anyway, she showed up so happy and beautiful and we met just like Ive met anyone. A good time. The first experience we picked some berries from an enormous blackberry patch (before the goats ate all them suckers. Note for any homesteaders. Protect those briars!) And I had slipped her my shirt for extra protection then used my Walmart stocking skills to quickly fill a few jars. Good times. Coincidentally she kept tripping, this girl… and I dunno if I was hovering but Id always try to catch her then we’d both fall over lol 😂 She landed on me twice, which I thought was hilarious and the most action I had seen since two random church / Prep clicke ladies (i was 18) assaulted me one in the front, one in the back grinding me. I loved that. Both happily married with kids. And is it assault if you dont mind? Lol it hurt legitimately but it was tolerable and wasnt too grindy. They knew their power lmao… 

Anyway. That was a cute first experience and its hard to tell the order of them all. But we went to the movies as a family, some other party type things, we were building a house, climbed a tree with me and my friend… My friend peer pressured her into smoking a little one time when I decided to hold back and give her and her brother a min to chill alone . (Highly doubt they did anything sexual but you never know.) 
One thing lead to another and one day i was showering and she popped her head in the door and I poked my head over the shower (im tall Remember.) 

We just stared a few moments and I was trying to invite her in with just my eyes and she seemed to laugh at me with hers then run away. 
One time she stayed over and my friend suggested we all sleep in the same bed. A big bed too. Plenty of space and she got the middle. We had previously joked about 3-ways and such but not seriously meaning it (or at least I didnt expect it.) 
She was trying her best to push me off the bed, i swear and given what I know now I
Wouldve just went for it then, but wouldve ruined the authenticity of the moments (authentic cuz my lifes been such a bore, heh) She slept like half the night forking me after I eventually worked up the courage to put my arm around her. My first cuddles 🥰 hah… anyway she eventually broke off from me that night and laying on my friend. I nodded off and yeah they probably did do it this night lol? Or not hard to tell but regardless thats what it was like being the third wheel. 
Some time went by and she talks to my friend about her sort of effeminate friend who’s obv bi from my assessment and my friend was viewing him as a threat. Meanwhile she visits a few times and we all hang out a bit. She petted my hair for a while one day “bonding” which was actually top 3 moments of my life maybe nonsexual. I was super aroused but women want to pretend these moments arent sexual , so its whatever, we were bonding and Friend never talks much about that. He knows he’s smarter, better musician, more successful than me and obv I prob not much of a threat to him other than him being intimidated by my looks somewhat (which were also maybe on a model level scale if I wasnt so unhealthy lol. Not to brag. I assume its very common to find yourself attractive. Thats sort of how it works at the base level, I dont wanna get into quibbles.) But eventually a day rolls around that Friend says “thats it, Im done with X, say your goodbyes to her but not directly cuz I have to be the one to tell her, yadda yadda.” Like the real ass he was. I had cuddled with her 2 times then, one he walked in on with his brother. More bonding. 
But that day in question he basically Abandoned her with me all day after she had driven hours to spend time with him. I just tired my best to make good memories. We walked around and talked. Swing in the swingset. Threw the 🏈 football and ate an apple 🍏, she ate most of it and asked if I wanted it. i threw It out as hard as I could and she sort of laughed like “not what I meant but ok” like I was gonna eat her top and bottom off (more foreshadowing) 
But yeah, that was the first time… and the 2nd we just watched a movie, Zoolander but didnt really pay attention.
Thats when he says this about it being “time” and prepare for it. Which was a big deal for me… i see I was being teased maybe or just set up to be happy for a moment… idk but still I didnt see this going anywhere for me. 
Thats when, the day rolls around she comes back. Her awesome self… and we all watched some Bo Burnham. My friend’s bro was also there and I was just sad the whole time because what he had said. At one point I just walked out into the cold, and the made my way down a dangerous cliff as it was super icy and cold out. One of my first experiences recklessly doing stuff but its a theme that’s repeated many times specially like this and similar ways like driving fast, etc. 

I made it back safe and she just asked “whats wrong with you?” i guess she could tell but my friend decided not to break it off just yet. She came over again shortly after
… aaand we cuddled yet again for many hours and then randomly my hand just brushed up against her exposed breast and that kind of shocked me out of my trance and i straightened up to try and get a view of the thing, so squish. And it was too dark. That’s when she starts guiding my head slowly towards the vague white mass and I lock on target 🎯 and then a few moments of this goes by 👅 … 
she darts off the couch and stands up. Like “i cant do this.” But then she gets on her knees in front of me after I stood up too. We locked eyes and i started to twitch and then gave it a few moments . Then I think i went to react for my zipper but her reaction time, better than any fighter had read my movement before it happened and retreated again. This time right into my friends bed, lol. I was like, wtf or whatever. I was still rushing off the high of the other thing so I wasnt thinking too straight or what to do next. I left to the next room then maybe a few minutes pass and Im anxious or whatever and decided to walk back in there and She’s getting eaten out and being pretty loud about it too. I just kinda sat there on the steps kinda sad, honestly. Like was this it, really? Feel like crying now but I wasnt yet that bad off at the time. I went back to the other room. The master bedroom and just chilled there the rest of the time. Actually feeling good still. Its probably too 1 of my nonsexual experiences cuz it just felt so right and unexpected. It confused me why it stopped short but wasnt complaining…

The next day I was visibly happy I guess, my friend starts grilling me. Like  X was so high strung last night and now youre all happy. Something mustve happened. And I kept lying and saying no… she had told me specifically not to tell him and that she was going to make sense of it. I wanted that to happen too… so I kept defending and should’ve just basically went back to my parents house then or threatened to get serious if it didnt drop the matter. But it kept going on and on, “Like dude, just tell me what happened. I need an excuse to break up. I know she was unfaithful, tell me.” 
And I got so angry I wanted to go Homer v Bart on him, so I blurted out what happened then he asked for clarification like “so did you initiate that or did she” and i said how she had pushed my head and maybe similar happened with him or smtn, idk but he seemed kinda offended like justified “Im gonna roast her now” look and he calls her and they have it out. It was a super basic conversation from what I could hear but he said he didnt mention what had happened.  “Youll be fine without me. Amazing, super smart, funny, beautiful, kind, etc.” 

Fast forward a few months of texting and then we made plans where Id visit her and I sold my Virtual character, a MUD dungeon wizard for a measly $40 for the gas money to her place. My friend let me borrow his car. And I learned the song All of Me on guitar and all the lyrics so I could impress her and help her get over her now ex. I wont go into details but I never ended up playing for her. I decided i didnt want to use his guitar for it (dumb reason, I was just nervous.) I wasnt the best musician, its true. And wasnt used to singing and chording, so was afraid it would come across more like a joke of a play through than a serious one…) 

At one point she had told me another guy sharing her name had visited her during this time but seemed like he might be gay. Idk, she just knew a lot of aristocratic types, I think. Come across as ladymen cuz they lived in doors and such. I was raised outdoors specifically and born into technology small bits at a time. Nintendo here, Sega genesis there, a PS1 destroyed, Morrowind and Forza on Xbox. So Im like the Blade of the millenial/ Gen Z ers getting a lot of hippie type, loving nature and remedies. Camping, climbing, etc. and Even my friend drove us both up there shortly after all this. 
He asked me before he went in, if I “wanted to have a 3 way with her still, he would ask.” And I thought about it 

I read online that in 3 ways, one person often feels neglected, and also that break up sex was not recommended. So i could only imagine this was a bad recipe for her specifically. I was down for my friend to ask but didnt want it to be like that. It pissed me off that was context. Like Why couldnt we ask together. He was taking half the fun and risk. But I just said I didnt think it was a good idea or whatever. 

And i didnt mention this before but I think he had a habit of calling people on speaker when grilling me or in this case asking. I think she was on the other line here, but have no evidence of this. After he pissed me off asking about the details of our cuddling and I yelled back I swear he said “did you catch that?”

Like maybe she was on the other line then too. I feel maybe they both played me somehow. Betrayed by both sides. Him for being selfish and forcing a situation like that. Causing me to get feelings. And her for teasing me so bad. I didnt mention that one night we were randomly in a house and she had drank a little and slept there in my lap a little, while Friend was away. (Another example of how I think they might’ve been playing me.) I just cant tell if it was playing me on both sides separately or they planned to make the ultimate fool out of me. Wish I could add more to clarify the picture or paint myself in a worse light; because yeah Ive unintentionally been a jerk during my life and am not faultless in this adventure. Ultimately I came to rely on this woman a lot from time to time. Id just call and see how things were and check in. My mental heath kept taking turns for the worse but i was also making good decisions as much as possible and trying to live healthy as possible. But yeah, i ultimately kept losing touch with myself and then lost her too. Something happened over the phone the last few times. Like her dog died, and my dog had just died too. So I said that, instead of like asking how long they had been together and their best moments and such. Idk. And we had a moment me and her dog, i kinda touched him on the nose after a night lying awake in her bed. 

 The story,
I had invited her to a bar where my friend was going play and I just chilled out in the car til she got there and we embraced a moment and sort of almost kissed. I was so high and in shock she got that close to me again I didnt even get to make it a 100% kiss, so more like 99.99% kiss here, maybe even better than 💯 😆🙄but it shocked me cuz she bad said basically everything between us was “a fluke” and we were “nothing” basically her words. I can’t remember them exactly now. But yeah I cried a lot. It was Valentine’s day. But I asked to stay the night with her after the bar and she said no, then my friend pestered her and she agreed. (🚩) but she was just saying how she thought Id get lost. Smartphones were just getting accessible around then and I had a samsung s1 and was confident its free gps could lead me home. **Spoiler.** Its battery died and I hadnt charged it. The night i just went to cuddle with her after shutting off the TV (my overnight walmart days made me sensitive to lights at night ) Looking back I should’ve obviously left her show on . I wasnt rushing to try stuff with her. I legitimately just wanted some human moment with her. In whatever form it took.talking, etc (which is why the TV was more important than I realized.) I was big into darkness and silence cuz I had been traumatized by lights and working, and the world itself wanted me poor and boring , I thought. i swear my brain didnt work too well back then cuz I grew up emotionally somewhat but now my insomnia and internet addiction has lead me to this burn out point. Where she wont speak to me since 2020 or so and I tried to seppuku via my friend online who met up with me after years and we experimented with some stuff and unbeknownst to me he had been chilling in this AC room the whole 2-3 days I was there and my room, the living room had the heat turned on in the middle of 100°F summmer days. When i tell you i barely made it out without a hospital, believe it. After that I have been commited 3 times all for monstrously tame reasons. Like they were just wanted to get rid of me… then I was held those 2 weeks in booking and put alone on the whole ward with just this 1 violent dude. Like they wanted us to fight. So yeah, i guess my application into Fight Club was accepted. Legit they talked a few times in there about “joining” The organization , and if you do, do X, etc, lol. But it wasnt anything weird. Just random, which felt nice. I actually had a good time except for the time i mentioned security crushed me upon entry jnto the place after they asked me to stand up counting back from 10. I stood up, then a giant with roid muscles lifted me and crushed til all my bones popped and i almost passed out. I think my shoulder or collarbone was broken then cuz I couldnt sleep right for a long time. Couldnt lay on my side. And every night for 5 nignts they forcibly injected me with a bunch of anti psychotics. All because I peeked out my room. We had been to the hospital the night before that and it took all night to get discharged. I wasnt thrilled to go a end night for no reason. 
Stay away from hospitals and women, or dont get brain damage and dont smoke and/ or drink much alcohol. Moral of the story I guess. Sorry for any typos or its too long. 

But yeah we didn’t talk that last night and I layed there my brain fried like it is now. When her dog approached me I just did the first thing that would get it to leave me alone. Like sort of touched its nose, so that was sort of awkward how it was that dog that passed. It was just me being braindead, tl;dr why she stopped talking to me. 

But am I overreacting? Why would he care so much about small moves on me then force situations where something can happen? Then ask directly after if I wanted that? Like Im assuming that was their “break up” sex moment there and he invited me, but just kinda weird how it mattered. Was he selfish? Or she treat us unfairly? I cant really decide where to stand.

1l8p6a7,https://i.redd.it/a2wa2736z96f1.jpeg,Fujin finally!,Hi all! Im probably the worst Azucena in the world. A few weeks ago i joined this community to get tips from others about Azucena. A lot of people chipped in with some great tips and YouTube channels for guidance. For the record I only play 1-2 hours a day because of my job and dont get a chance to grind and get better.  But now im a bit decent and finally managed Fujin. So happy! Cheers! The game may be trash but the community is amazing ❤️,9,1749637699.0,Tekken8,8,0.85,False

Hello again folks! Your resident performance obsessed Redditor here, with my updated Pagespeed guide! It's gone through significant revisions since the last time I posted it. It has grown another 16 pages, up from 368 to over 384+ (and growing!) pages of content. It's officially hit full on novel length!

Major content additions, expansions on everything that was previously in the guide, significantly better and more logical organization, revamped table of contents, grammar and spelling fixes, many new optimization strategies and much needed additional specificity.

**[Don’t forget to check the table of contents, it is not expanded by default! The icon is on the top left side on desktop](https://imgur.com/a/GjsPhfo)**

Included is a breakdown on how to analyze and interpret Speed Test reports to identify optimization opportunities.

Wordpress specific optimizations: It has sections on how to optimize common features including Ads, Forms, Woocommerce, Analytics, Google Maps, Custom Fields, Galleries, Video Players, Sliders, Filters, SEO plugins, Anti-Spam, Cookie Notices, Backup plugins; in addition to one size fits all optimizations(Images, Videos, CDN, SSL, CSS, JS, Resource Hints, Fonts, Caching, HTML Document size, DOM optimization, etc), and tons and tons more.

There's an extensive amount of optimization information and resources for server stack configuration for NGINX, Apache, OpenLiteSpeed, Varnish, Object Caching, PHP, HAProxy, MySQL, SSL, Gzip/Brotli, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, Security considerations effects on performance and Linux optimizations. There are also a bunch of resources on database optimization.

Every optimization opportunity has a free plugin option (or multiple) listed. Some paid plugins are included as I find them very useful(Perfmatters and Asset Cleanup Pro for example). However I've included alternatives for all paid options. Every single thing in my guide can be implemented for free. 

I've done my best to cover all of the bases you’d find in any page speed guide, in addition to a focus on adding uncommon optimization strategies and solutions that you won’t find in any off the shelf guide. This is a compilation of all of my research over the last 6 years delving into performance optimization.

I'm confident that if you follow every single step in the guide, almost any site you maintain can score 90+ on a Pagespeed Insights Mobile Speed Test. 

If you notice anything missing from my performance guide that you think I should add, or if there is some information you believe needs to be amended (or expanded on), please let me know in the comments and I'll be sure to add a section or revise the content on the topic (if necessary) as soon as possible!

If you feel that the guide is too overwhelming and you'd prefer to have someone else optimize your site’s performance or need a consultation, feel free to DM me.

If anyone wants to be able to import a large set of free optimization plugins (and you can selectively choose which ones to download/install), download WP Favs. I do need to update the collection since I've added tons to the guide since the last time I posted this, but it's still comprehensive:

The most recent additions to the guide have been: Refinements throughout the guide, grammatical fixes, and more concise explanations.
