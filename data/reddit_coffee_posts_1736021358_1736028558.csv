We weren’t perfect before—who is?—but Lisa’s death fractured us. My dad barely speaks anymore, my mom busies herself with every charity event she can find, and I… I’ve been stuck. Angry. Looking for someone to blame.

Lisa was the glue that held us together. She was warm, outgoing, always laughing. The kind of person people gravitate to. She loved hiking, photography, and the outdoors. Her death—officially ruled an accident—was almost poetic.

She slipped while hiking and fell into a ravine. At least, that’s what the police report said.

But if that’s true, why does it feel like her ghost never left?

Lisa’s ex-boyfriend, Matt, was never part of our family.

He and Lisa dated for about a year before she broke it off. She said he was controlling, obsessive—constantly texting, showing up unannounced, making passive-aggressive comments when she spent time with her friends. I remember her joking about it once, calling him “my stage-five clinger.”

But it wasn’t funny. Not really.

After the breakup, Matt didn’t take it well. He kept texting her, leaving voicemails, even sending her flowers at work. She brushed it off, said he’d get bored eventually.

I thought she was right. Until the funeral.

Matt didn’t come to the service, thank God. But a week later, he showed up on our doorstep.

It was a rainy Thursday. My mom opened the door and there he was, holding a bouquet of lilies—Lisa’s favorite.

“I just wanted to pay my respects,” he said. His voice was soft, his head tilted like he was trying to look vulnerable.

My mom, who has never been good at saying no, let him in.

Matt sat on our couch, talking about Lisa as if he knew her better than we did. He described her laugh, her smile, the way she always ordered pancakes with extra syrup. My dad stayed silent, his jaw tight.

When Matt finally left, I asked my mom why she let him in.

“He’s grieving too,” she said.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that Matt wasn’t grieving.

He was lurking.

Over the next few months, Matt kept appearing.

He showed up at family barbecues, holiday dinners, even my dad’s birthday party. Always uninvited, always with some excuse. “Your mom said it was okay,” he’d claim, or, “I thought Lisa would’ve wanted me here.”

My parents, blinded by their own grief, let it slide.

“He’s harmless,” my mom said. “He just misses her.”

But it wasn’t harmless. Not when he started asking questions.

Last Christmas, Matt cornered me in the kitchen.

“She was different with me, you know,” he said, leaning against the counter.

I stiffened. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

He smiled, that thin, unsettling smile I’d seen so many times. “She told me things she wouldn’t tell anyone else.”

“Like what?”

His smile widened. “Like how she wasn’t scared to die.”

That night, I went through Lisa’s journals.

She was the type to write everything down—her thoughts, her plans, even little grocery lists. Most of it was normal Lisa stuff: song lyrics, doodles, random observations.

But then I found the entry.

“I think Matt’s been following me. He won’t stop texting. Keeps saying he knows something I don’t. I’m starting to feel like I can’t shake him.”

I showed it to my mom, expecting her to finally see reason.

But she waved it off. “Lisa was dramatic sometimes,” she said. “I’m sure it’s nothing.”

A few days later, I saw Matt’s car parked down the street.

It wasn’t the first time. I’d noticed it before, idling near the corner, but I convinced myself it was a coincidence. This time, though, I knew.

He wasn’t watching our family. He was watching me.

Last week was my dad’s birthday.

Matt showed up, holding a gift he claimed Lisa would’ve bought: a coffee table book about hiking trails.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I confronted him outside, away from my parents.

“What the hell are you doing here?” I snapped.

His smile didn’t falter. “Paying my respects,” he said.

“Lisa broke up with you. She wanted nothing to do with you. Why can’t you let her go?”

His eyes darkened. “She told you that?”

“Yes.”

He took a step closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. “She told me a lot of things too. Things she didn’t tell anyone else.”

Then he said something I’ll never forget:

“I was there, you know. On the trail.”

I felt like the air had been sucked out of my lungs.

“What?”

He smiled again, a cold, empty thing. “She didn’t fall. She looked me in the eyes and asked me to let her go.”

My stomach churned. “You’re lying.”

He tilted his head, studying me. “Am I? Ask yourself this: If she slipped, why didn’t she scream?”

I called the police that night.

I told them everything—the stalking, the journal, his confession.

When they went to his apartment the next morning, it was empty. No furniture, no clothes, no sign he’d ever lived there.

It’s been a week now.

I haven’t told my parents what he said. I don’t know if they’d believe me.

Every night, I double-check the locks. Every night, I sit in my bed, clutching my phone, too scared to sleep.

Last night, I finally decided to look through Lisa’s journals again. I don’t know why. Maybe I thought I missed something. Maybe I was looking for answers.

But this time, there was something new.

The last page, which had been blank before, now had a single sentence scrawled across it in jagged black ink:

“He’s not watching. He’s inside.”",1,1736028330.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1htpou5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1htpou5/advice_about_my_feelings_41f_for_another_man/,Advice about my feelings (41F) for another man ,"Ok here's my story (41F). I've been in love with a man (47M) for nearly four years. We're both married. My marriage is good, with its definite ups and downs but we do love each other and want to stay together. 
But... Four years ago I met this other man and we've had a connection ever since. I'd say we're definitely friends but there's always been some sort of undeniable chemistry but nothing ever happened. Last year I couldn't take it anymore and I first told my husband about my feelings for the other man (which I feel is significant that I told him first), he was shocked but appreciated my honesty and we've had good talks about it since, and secondly, I told my friend about my feelings for him. He said he wasn't in love with me as I am with him but agreed about the chemistry. We went through an awkward phase where we still saw each other and now it seems like we've made it through too and we're still friends. But my feelings remain. I have never wanted anyone as much as him. But I know I cannot pursue this. I do not want a relationship with him. It would be mere sex, a mere affair. I want to be with my husband in the end. My husband still knows about it and we've had such good conversations about our needs in our relationship and he's given me a carte blanche for this man. If I want to pursue it, I can. But I cannot hurt my friend's wife. I cannot hurt her feelings. I know her vaguely, we are on a hello how are you basis but from woman to woman I really try to respect her. I already feel so guilty for the thoughts I have about her husband and nothing really has ever happened other than giving each other gifts, some hugs and well sort of 'secret' coffee meetings with the two of us. It's not really a big boundary crossing but it's definitely an intimate friendship, and from my side obviously with desire for more. 
Recently, my friend and I became closer again and he's invited me over for a bottle of wine, kind of like a date with the two of us. I honestly don't know what will happen. I've been wanting this for so long but I also do not know if he kisses me, if I can resist. I want to be strong but I've wanted this man for so long... I just don't know what to do. On the one side my husband is fine with it all, on the other I do not want to hurt his wife's feelings, but what do I want?! And what does he want? My gut feelings says this is not nothing...
I'm asking it here in this community because I'd be interested in a guy's take on this. ",1,1736028171.0,AskMenAdvice,2,1.0,False

1htpmjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1htpmjt/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

So we spent about 5 days in Colorado. It was 8 of us in total: me, Kee(29), his parents, his younger sister(26), her husband, and his two younger brothers(24 and 21). We stayed in a 5 bedroom villa type house so we were weren’t all over each other. His parents covered everything from food, gear, accommodations, and activities. We did two days on the slopes which was scary but fun. We did snowboarding the first day and skiing the second. We went snowtubing one day. Then, we went snowmobiling and UTV riding one day and that was super fun. They’re big UTV riders so this was right up their alley. Kee just bought himself two new ones this past summer. We even went to a Denver Nuggets game to watch them beat up on our Atlanta Hawks. Our final night we went to Ruth Chris to wrap up the trip.

Going into the trip I already had good relationships with his mom and sister. His sister is my age so we get along really well. His mom is great and has been extremely welcoming. She’s bought me birthday and Christmas gifts. She and my mom have actually become friends which is pretty cool. So while I already had those relationships established, I wanted to get to know the men in his family a little more. He has two older sisters and an older brother as well but they’re off raising kids so they don’t come around as much.

One morning I got to have a really nice conversation with the 21 year old brother. He’s graduating college in the spring so we just talked about his next steps and goals. He isn’t interested in dating and is focusing on his soccer career post college. I feel like I learned a lot about him from that conversation. 

I bonded with their dad over my love of a good reuben. He said that he rarely meets people under 45 who even like corned beef.   So that was funny.

Overall, the trip was amazing. I tried a lot of new things over the course of 5 days. That’s something I really love and appreciate about my relationship with Kee. Being exposed to things I would’ve never really thought to do. Like UTV riding, snowboarding, skiing. Like him and two brothers played soccer growing up and all three played at the college level. Kee even spent a year and a half overseas playing. And now I spend nearly every Wednesday watching him play in a league. He’s big into gaming and console collecting. I have a younger brother but he wasn’t really into video games so I never played games. Kee is also into woodworking and building stuff(he actually made me a vanity from scratch) and a big history buff. Until this relationship I hadn’t really encountered guys who were into stuff like that. I love how well rounded he is in his interests. 

Someone asked where I found him and the answer is Starbucks. It was honestly just a chance encounter. A coworker of mine says we have a Hallmark love story and I didn’t see it until she broke it down one day. She was like “So let me get this straight. You got into a bad accident and had to come back to your hometown to recover. And while on your way to an appointment you drop into a coffee shop and hit it off with a handsome guy who ends up being the man of your dreams”. So I guess we kinda do have a Hallmark love story. It’s definitely my favorite love story. We actually woke up at 7am the day of our return flight just to sneak off to the Starbucks near our hotel. We just wanted a quick little date before leaving Colorado. 

So yeah, the trip was great and I loved bringing in the new year with my love and the people he loves. He himself said that he was in heaven during this trip because he had his favorite girl, his ride or die girls(mom and sister), and his boys all together and getting along. Hope everyone had a Happy New Year!

My cousin (lets call her X) and me were the ones organizing most of it, mostly it was me though.
When we were in Amsterdam, things started to get weird. My cousins were super slow, I had made a google maps plan of the places we want to visit, the places I want to show them as I have been to Amsterdam a lot of times. 
When booking, I asked if it is fine if I only pay for half of the tickrt since I have a 50% discount card that I pay monthly. Eventually I thought it‘s a dick move so I just paid the full amount.
Anyways, my cousins kept stopping everywhere, at random coffee shops and I was not waiting for them with my other cousins cuz we were losing a lot of time for nothing. 
Eventually I went to the van goghs museum with my sister as the others didnt want to come, we hurried and when we came back (my cousin X was waiting for us and convincing my other cousins to wait for us too, which I didnt know). When we arrived she said something like ""hallelujah finally now lets fucking go"" and I answered wow what an attitude. Then she kept yelling at me in public how disrespectful I am and that I have 0 respect. I told her that we should discuss it later or at another time since we were all tired and would say stuff we dont mean. She kept insulting me, started yelling st me at least 3 times and then she cried and told all my cousins how horrible I am and how selfish I am. 
Anyways I didnt know how to handle the situation because I was hurt too, and she was probably too but I felt like she was being disrespectful towards me in the first place. She called her mom and told her to tell my parents that I am a selfish asshole.
Anyways we went on and went to the central station to get our train back home, but the train was cancelled after keeping us there for 2 hours. We checked in in a hotel, I kept asking the personnel at the main station if they could offer us anything, like getting us as close to the border/home as possible but there was no option. We were told multiple times that we need an invoice to get the compensation. I also told them that when we check out we need the invoice and have to ask for it (i get it, we were all tired and they might have forgotten).
The next day I went getting the train tickets as the internstional office opened at 6am. I had really bad fever before sleeping and I have peripheral neuropathy which got really bad that night and as we didnt plan do sleep there, I didnt habe my meds. 
They were all sleeping in and in the meantime I was struggling getting the stupid tickets back. Eventually I checked out as I waited at the lounge until 9am and I wanted to get some meds at a pharmacy, so I checked out and got the invoice. 
In the train I asked my cousin for the invoice and she said she doesnt know what im talking about and then I was like its such a normal thing to do, like to ask for an invoice when u leave a hotel. And apparently that was super disrespectful, she kept yelling at me in the train in the quiet zone, I told her to leave me alone, she cried and called her mom telling her that I am scamming her and im selfish cuz I didnt remind them to get the invoice (I was super stressed and in pain, plus I left my sis alone at the lounge and we wanted to get breakfast).
I am just super sad that we couldnt talk like adults and that she kept sayinf all these mean things about me and my mental health when shes clearly struggling mentally too. She was blaming me for everything even tho I was the one taking care of every single thing and I forgot 1 little thing, 1 reminder. 
After all when we arribed home I said bye and she ignored me, I texted her that there was probably a huge misunderstanding and we were tired and sick and should talk about it and she ignored me. Shes stressed with uni but so am I, I have exams coming up and only went to Amsterdam for the sake of my family as I have been there plenty of times. I just wanted everyone to have a fun time. 
AITAH? I‘m withholding 1 thing tho, my other cousin has a disc herniation which I didnt know of, hence all the stops and them being so slow, and my cousin X was taking that in consideration but no one told me about this, obviously I wouldve slowed down. I was just super sad that I planned the whole thing and what to see and it wasnt possible, plus I told them to get a day ticket for public transportation but they refused to get one ",1,1736027539.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

we lost our fucking minds. We hadn't had a Thanksgiving since 12/10/24...they fucking poured gravy, cranberry, bird, all that shit, too much. 

The Ham and eggs were sublime, and they pulled a waffle. Too cool the heat, the help put on a cool Dishes and ashtrays...amazing the one guy, he has so many types of ashtray, incredible...

Some crispy hashbrowns crunched into some fatty bacon...they brought Donna out and did France but they only did that because she poured the orange juice, which was sweet.

I was pretty active on alt.coffee and went to the SCAA convention in Atlanta in 2004 as a consumer member.  I started with a rebuilt original white Gaggia Coffee, rebuilt a La Pavoni Professional, moved to a PID controlled Silvia, and then an Expobar Office Control, and then back to the Silvia.  I then got married and didn't have a place for an espresso machine in the kitchen for a long time, and I strictly did brewed coffee. 

This past year we moved and the new house has a bar that is perfect for my coffee station, so I started looking.  At first I bought a Flair Signature, and let me tell you absolutely nothing about that process is easy or rewarding.  Those of you that like them - more power to you.   Then I thought I wanted a Bambino Plus, but found a deal on a Bambino I couldn't pass up ($56 from a liquidation company).  I figured it would be fine for dipping my toes in espresso again. 

Holy crap.   How is making really good espresso this easy??  I literally can go from turning the machine on to having a cappa in 3 minutes and 30 seconds.  And that includes hand grinding on my K6!  Even with zero puck prep other than pushing it down with my finger and using the crappy plastic tamper they included I get beautiful and tasty espresso - pretty much better than anything I made regularly in the past on so many machines that were technically more capable.   

Sure I've ordered a bottomless portafilter, tamper, distribution tool, wdt tool, etc since they all are cheap - but the quality I get out of the machine using 18g of coffee and a good hand grinder is just ridiculous. ",4,1736027343.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

To give you guys a little background, I am an  immigrant from India. Immigrants from some countries can use their country's license to drive for the first year. I took advantage of this. Bought a car and practiced. I did not take any lessons. I failed on my first attempt two weeks ago with 1 major and 5 minors. Major was a meeting situation. The car coming from other side had to stop because of me and it resulted in a major fault. But this time I was able to nail it.

Tips on booking the test -

The first time I booked it, I got a date for February 2025. I installed Testi and took premium but damn, it's shit. Does not book automatically. Whenever, if ever, I got notification of a cancellation, tapping on the notification resulted in getting blocked by the DVSA website. So, I took the matters in my own hands and was able to get a mid December date by manually opening the booking page again and again. It did take a lot of of my time and tries. I think I got the date within 3 days.

But when I failed I had book again. This time after getting the initial far off date, I was not getting lucky by manual process. I used the free Chrome extension, and it also took it's time. Many days actually but I wasn't doing it manually so no harm done. And finally it worked. Thank you Chrome extension guy. I'll definitely pay for your coffee.

Now for preparation, I watched YouTube videos and used the Driving Test Routes app. It's a subscription at £15 a month if I remember correctly. At first I was skeptical but no other app was available. But I was amazed after installing it. The routes were quite similar to what my friend's instructors were taking them to. So, I definitely recommend this app. Install and use it 1 month before your test. It should be enough.

That's my journey. If any of you guys need any help or suggestions, feel free to hit me up.

Imagine how much you could get if there weren't dirty vagrants camped outside.

Safe parking check.

The reality is. It's a great program that is getting people off the streets.

How can we speed this up?

If you follow this simple plan, your city will be clean by the end of the month.

Here's a quick list:

(1) Community/private showers with both hot and cold water.

If you're looking for a model to replicate, spend some time in a truck stop. Spend $15 and actually shower. The water pressure is on point. Towels and soap are provided. The best perk is someone cleans it before the next person goes in. 

Btw, pay the guys and gals who clean the showers a living wage. Then they won't be camped out by your million dollar property. But at least they'll have a place to hang out besides your front yard.

Hire security. Have a small team of the same social workers who are used to deescalating situations so the security guard only has to deal with paperwork. Occasionally he/she might have to call the police.

(2) The second thing you will find at many truck stops (Petro is your model for two and three) is a movie theater. On loop they must have 30 movies that play in a theater that's cleaner and smells better than most truckers. That's not an insult. It's a fact. If your shower card is wiped, and you have a family to feed, house and clothe, $15 is an unnecessary expense.

(3) The third thing Petro Travel Centers have is a fully stocked salad bar. Both flying J and Petro offer great food. Steak. Salmon. There are coffee bars at every truck stop in America. Actually eat there so you know how easy this would be to do. There is a reason they make so much money. It's run by a small team. Ask to see the kitchen. I'm talking to you community leaders, not the dolts that got elected to a job they can't comprehend.

Why should you - the community and it's leaders - do this?

You can't afford not to.

In San Diego, I had Safe Parking. That's great. What I didn't have was a job. I had to leave before 7 AM, but that was because the lot was used during the day.

No complaints there. It was better than nothing.

Where did I spend my day? Specifically, where did I spend the holidays?

At your parks. Urban hiking with my full pack on - loaded with extra gear for exercise - walking around in your billion dollar neighborhoods. Rucking!

Don't do it for me. Do it for your community.

....

It's a good thing I'm not in charge. 

If I really wanted to get the homie-bums off the streets, I would open up a bottle clubs and bars - owned and operated by the City - and they would receive free coupons for community service (picking up the trash the homebums left behind.

Now I don't think social workers would be a good fit in this environment.

A better fit is the police. The Rich Man's Gang.

Two things I know about Police.

They love overtime. And some of them like to thump drunks.

Shit! 

The city could make back all of their money if they had a dedicated YouTube channel devoted to live streaming Police kicking bums asses.

The problem is y'all would get demonetized for violence.

....

See ya on the other side of the tracks.

I'm gone.

.....

P.s., The San Diego police seem pretty chill. Even with the vagabonds, homie-bums and the mentally ill. I loved San Diego, but was just as uncomfortable as you were at the park.

1htovvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1htovvw/2_weeks_in_withdrawal_symptoms_are_crazy/,"2 weeks in, withdrawal symptoms are crazy ","I have been drinking one small cup of strongly brewed coffee every morning for the past few years (before that was mostly coffee-free but drank green tea). 

I think the coffee is contributing to migraines and sleep issues, which are my main reasons for going off it.

I'm 2 weeks in, some days having no caffeine and others having one small cup of white tea (which has I think 12mg caffeine). 

This is what Ive experienced in the past two weeks: I am EXHAUSTED. I feel sick. I feel depressed. My head hurts. I'm nauseous. Zero motivation, tons of body aches and I am falling asleep at random times, just passing out- almost narcoleptic. My body feels like it's weighed down with sand bags. My eyes feel heavy. I've been sleeping sometimes 15 hours a day, and I am still tired. I feel like a zombie and can't focus. Even going to the store feels overwhelming. 

It's WILD to me how just one small cup of coffee could be so powerful that I am experiencing this level of withdrawal. It's also a wake up call to how dependent I've become on coffee to function, have ""energy"" (I know it's false energy) and to feel any level of good feelings.

I'm really hoping things get better soon, because this is really hard to get through and so hard not to just cave to make all these symptoms go away (exactly like a drug! So crazy)",2,1736026013.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend, Joe, and I have been together for a year and a half. In 2024, I lost my mom to cancer. She was everything to me - my confidante, advisor, and loving parent. She always told me to never let a man control or hurt me, saying I'm too beautiful and deserving of love to be treated that way. Today, her words resonate with me more than ever.

Joe and I love each other, but we had an argument today about bills. Every time we argue, he threatens to leave, making me feel like I'll be alone again. I've already lost my mom, a friend, and an ex-sister-in-law this past year.

As we argued about the expensive winter bills, Joe got angry and broke my TV and glass coffee table. I'm lying in bed, crying, and unsure of what to do while he's at work. I lied to my neighbor to avoid trouble. I feel alone, sad, and unsure of how to move forward.

I haven't cleaned the broken glass yet; I think I'm in shock. I'm questioning whether the world is against me, and I keep attracting toxic people who claim to love me but don't. My past relationships have been abusive, with partners who hurt me physically and emotionally.

Joe said he'd never hurt me, but his words and actions are contradictory. He left me alone when I needed him most, after my mom passed away. He complained about visiting my mom in the hospital and didn't attend her funeral.

I love Joe, but I'm not sure if he loves me. I don't think he cares about my feelings or well-being. I've told him about his anger issues, but nothing changes. I'm torn between wanting him to succeed and be happy, and needing to prioritize my own emotional safety.

As I lay here, crying and feeling numb, I don't know what to do. My whole life has been marked by abuse and toxic relationships. I feel like a target, attracting people who pretend to be nice but ultimately hurt me. Please, somebody, help me. What do I do?",2,1736025933.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

And with that, I continue to look into my tangible thoughts of living in a log cabin with no more than a fluffy cat and a St. Bernard. The image of the wealthy man/woman in a red robe sitting by the fireplace comes to mind, wherein the dog rests under their feet and the cat sits in a loaf shape on their lap as the comfy person gently scratches the cat’s head, whilst sipping scotch or beer or coffee or cocoa- for me, scotch, and has the ability to sleep all day; one would never have to move too far, as tables are made specifically for being placed directly beside recliners- and mine would be stocked with liquor, snacks, and weed.

Yes, I can smell the burning wood in my fireplace as the buzz from the scotch as well as the high from the pungent Maine weed causes me to sink deeper and deeper into my thickly- padded lounge chair. 

And most of all, I can feel the leisure of knowing that I’m on my land- and that there is a large hill I can sled down nearby. I yearn for the day where I become so old, that I realize I can no longer walk up the hill to sled anymore.

She was really a fun person to talk to. She knew the latest game news, loved anime and also played a moba game which I love a lot. Sometimes here and there she would jokingly flirt around with me and probably with my other buds as well but we really didn't mind it that much. I really liked her (not romantically) a lot. 

Fast forward to some months later, I visited her home state once as my sister was planning on studying there for her higher education. I thought it would be fun to meet her and initially she liked the idea too.

Here's where the story begins. On the day I first reached the destination, I told her and she said that she would meet me at the bus station at around 9 PM. When it was around 9 PM, she told me she couldn't meet with me since she had some other work to do and told me to rest. 

This same thing happened for like 2 days more. She told me she was going to paid for her part time job so she wouldn't be able to meet me and one time she even told me that her bus took a detour.

I didn't really think much of it and I thought she was very busy. So while I was at a restaurant, I texted her saying -

""Hey why don't I visit you at your workplace (she works at a cafe). I could meet you there and heck even have a nice coffee!"".

She hesitated by saying stuff like it's too far, visitor are not allowed and stuff like that. I understood at that moment that she was avoiding me.

As the conversation continued, she abruptly told me the following words -

""you know... You scare me""...

That's it. I apologised to her for asking her to meet up with me and stopped talking with her.

Until a few days ago when I was busy pushing rank and we were one player short. That moment one of my friends invited her and she left immediately. I realised at that moment that i was still friends with her in-game so I blocked her there.

Today, we were as usual one man short and she filled in the role. She is a really good mage player and our team synergy was OP.

She texted me a while ago asking why I had blacklisted her. During game time, I don't really mind playing with her since my friends are in good terms with her (I won't tell them to break their friendship for me, I ain't dumb) and also during game I tend to keep irl stuff aside. 

That being said, AITA for playing with her even after I blocked her. Please advise this fellow teenager. Thank You 🙏",2,1736025521.0,AITAH,4,0.75,False

So this is my fifth set that I’ve done on myself and I cannot get my nails to last more than a couple days without them breaking or popping off. This time I was literally opening of coffee and snap my thumbnail down the middle.

Also, I find it difficult to get the nail forms flushed to my nail, which creates some lifting at the cuticle. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I love the look of long nails, but with them being so fragile, it doesn’t make it worth it for me to wear them.

During this time, especially week 3 and 4, l've still had strong appetite suppression, sometimes needing to consciously remember to eat, but have been able to hit 1500-2000 calories a day, while usually burning around 3500 (sometimes more on days with very heavy exercise). 

Side effects the day after the last injection were worse than the others, and I was close to vomiting after some coffee and oatmeal. The rest of the week was mostly fine though (heartburn solvable with Tums), and some side effects like constipation have gotten a lot better since starting.

My follow up with PCP was 16 days after starting, and I opted to titrate up to 5mg for the next dose, knowing it's considered the minimum therapeutic dose, and hearing how many people had the effects start to fall off on 2.5mg. I'm starting to regret that, seeing how things have actually played out so far, and have been antsy about the potential side effects and level of appetite suppression 5mg will bring.

Curious if anyone else has been in a similar boat. I'm injecting 5mg for the first time today, with the assumption it will start out stronger than I want (since 2.5mg is still on the strong side), but I'm not sure if I should continue on for a while, since my body likely will eventually adjust to it, or at what point I should talk to my PCP about jumping back down to 2.5mg (e.g. if it progresses to actual vomiting).

Dyvone as Dark Pit and The Commander

Trailer(ish thing):

Trailer opens with a dramatic shot of a sun setting over the horizon, with eerie music in the background. The screen flashes with images of Pit and Viridi preparing for a date, only to be interrupted by chaos erupting in the streets below, then it Cut to Pit, adjusting his toga, nervously checking his watch. Viridi, radiant and mischievous, rolls her eyes at him.

Pit: ""Come on, Viridi! I can make it to our date after saving this village from those pesky demons!""
Viridi: ""You’re always saving the world, Pit! Can’t you just let someone else take the reins for a change?""

Suddenly, a cacophony of sounds—demons screeching, explosions, and the chaos of battle—fills the air. Cut to Shadow, dramatically leaning against a tree on a hillside.

Shadow: ""I will be King of Hell… but first, I need to figure out how to handle all this… competition.""
Rouge: (Waving her newly polished nails) “Honey, you’re going to need a more intimidating evil plan. ‘Adequately’ just doesn’t have the ring to it, y'know?”
Omega: (In a booming monotone) “AFFIRMATIVE. A DETAILED SPREADSHEET OF INFERNAL DOMINATION IS REQUIRED.”
Black Doom appears
Black Doom: ""Shadow… it’s me, the devil! I’m here to convince you to do sin! Come with me, steal candy from babies and small businesses! No, I’m not talking about Walmart!”
Shadow rolls his eyes, clearly unimpressed.
Shadow: ""I’m going to take over Hell! Not starting a Candy War, Dicknips.""

Quick cuts show Dark Pit pacing ominously, surrounded by Eggman and Fang.
Dark Pit (monologuing):""With the world under my control, I’ll show Viridi that I’m better than my annoying counterpart. She will have no choice but to notice me!""
Fang: ""I mean, I guess that’s fine as long as I get my money, I don’t really care.""

Cut to an upbeat montage featuring Knuckles in a noodle bar, tossing a bowl at a robber with astounding accuracy.
Knuckles: ""More noodles, please!""

The mood shifts back to the chaotic streets, where Pit is heroically battling demons while sneakily trying to text Viridi about their date.
Interspersed shots of Rayquaza licking Viridi's face and playfully tugging at Pit’s toga are shown, followed by a scene with Palutena mothering everyone.
Palutena: ""Be careful, Pit! I don’t want you getting too close to those demons… and watch your toga!""

President Chris Pratt: Alright, listen up, heroes! We need funds for… um… important stuff! Like, uh, bigger explosions! And maybe a new coffee machine for my personally curated 'Coffee Time' set! So dig deep, soldiers! Those demon-battling funds don’t grow on hellfire trees!
Commander: (shaking the donation bucket at a soldier) Come on, private! Don't be a cheapskate! Do it for freedom! And for my new golf clubs.

The scene switches to a dark and ominous location, where the stakes are rising. The backdrop shifts to Pumpkin Hill, as the theme plays in the background. The trailer culminates in a series of quick cuts to Pit getting his cheek kissed by Viridi on the same hill as Shadow, then to Sonic, Amy and Tails

Sonic: “Uh, guys? Did we take a wrong turn? I thought we were going to the chili dog festival.”
Amy: (Frantically pulls out a map) “I swear I checked the directions!”
Tails: “Maybe we should just… run for this one?”

then the trailer cuts to Eggman on a tv screen in the noodle bar

Eggman: ""I’ve come to make an announcement! Shadow the Hedgehog is a Bitchass MotherFu—""
Before he can finish, the screen cuts to black, revealing the title card with l explosive music:
""THE RISE OF PIRIDI GOES TO HELL""
As the laughter of the cast echoes in background.
""Romance, Comedy, and Sin!""

The music stops, changing to Mephiles’ Whisper, The trailer really ends with two red eyes in the dark place, filling the screen.)

My son will be 4 in two weeks. He’s always been tough. Smart, funny, friendly, but strong willed as all hell. He’s never liked being told “no,” but recently it’s been really bad. You literally cannot correct him on anything or redirect him towards anything without him flipping out. I’m at a loss. For example, he was pushing the coffee table around at my mom’s house and my dad told him politely to stop doing that because he was scratching the floor. He immediately yelled, “stop it! No! You’re a bad grandpa!” And tried to swing his hand at him. 

When we try to tell him no to anything he will do this. It’s almost like he takes redirection as a direct threat or something. I haven’t gotten word that he does this in school, though. I don’t know what to do. I feel like time out doesn’t even work with him. And just having a conversation with him doesn’t work either. Any advice? ",4,1736025127.0,Preschoolers,0,1.0,False

Figured i’d write about the newest ones i have for anyone interested! 

**Cloud Bread (egg custard & warm caramelized fluffy cloud bread)-** Not a fan tbh, it honestly smelled like buttery salty bread on me. Super realistic to me but wasnt vibing with it.

**Foggy Froggy (earl grey tea, marshmallow, amber, smoky fog)-** Bright citrus at first, smells a lot like a lemon tea that was left in a cup for a little bit with a hint of creamy marshmallow.

**Potion Milk (mango, cinnamon sugar, vanilla milk, praline)-** Bright slightly tart mango, then goes into a “nutty citrus” scent. The cinnamon isnt noticeable to me tbh.

**Glazed Donut (yeasty donut, sugar glaze, maple)-** Almost realistic donut scent, has a slight toasted cookie scent to it later on.

**Honey Oats (toasted oats, honey)-** Honestly smells like a honey & oats soap bar. It’s clean & slightly sweet but soapy.

**Espresso Vanilla Bean (vanilla bean, vanilla orchid, musk, espresso)-** Strong bitter coffee in the beginning, a musky vanilla come through a little bit. Then it stays like a “roasted” musky vanilla throughout.

**Lemon Bundt Cake (sugared lemon, buttery cake, vanilla icing)-** Unfortunately this was a scrubber, it smelled like lemon cleaning products on me.

**Strawberry Milk (sweet strawberry, creamy vanilla)-** Literally smells like strawberry milk. That artificial scent you’d find in those strawberry meal drinks or like nesquik.

**Straw Baby (strawberry milk, baby powder, pink lipstick)-** Sour strawberry, think like a sour strawberry gummy. Does go a bit creamy & less sour with a hint of powder. But i really just get a gummy scent.

**Fluff (laundry scent of vanilla, musk, amber, lily of the valley)-** A clean vanilla, nothing much to say tbh. It does smell like a vanilla scented laundry soap, but not a sweet vanilla.

**Coquettish (peach, skin musk, vanilla silk)-** Powdery musky peach, goes into a slightly sweet creamy peach with that powdery musk still there.

**Cranberry Orange Pastry (pastry, sweet orange, tart cranberry)-** Buttery orange pastry, kinda tart but that sweet orange is more prominent. 

**Chocolate Chip Cookie (buttery, toasted cookies, chocolate chips)-** Did actually smell like a chocolate chip cookie but then it goes super artificial for me & waxy. 

**Snowflake Princess (cotton candy, cherry, red apple, caramel, icy musk)-** I get the skin of a red apple with a sweet cherry candy. The cotton candy reminds me of the cotton candy scent you’d get from ice cream or lip balm. There’s something really nostalgic about this scent for me lol

**Kittens & Angel Cream (marshmallow, coconut cream, caramel macaroon, amber, tonka, sandalwood)-** A clean, kinda toasted scent. I get a lot of that coconut & macaroon scent but the amber is super prominent on me. There is a powdery-ness to it which makes it smell clean to me.

Miami was waking up slowly, hungover from the euphoria of New Year’s Eve. I’d celebrated with Miguel, my best friend since the 1980s, over music, dancing, and an alarming amount of fireworks that we lit illegally in the backyard. It was a night of laughter, one of those rare moments when the weight of my 625 years felt light.

The morning started like any other. I padded into my kitchen, a space I’d meticulously maintained over the decades. Stainless steel appliances gleamed against dark wooden cabinets. The fridge held a predictable assortment: almond milk, leftover arroz con pollo, an embarrassing variety of craft beers (for guests), and my preferred snacks—Greek yogurt, beef jerky, and a hoard of frozen dumplings. A pack of Red Bull was strategically stacked next to the vegetables I’d promised myself to eat more often.

Breakfast was routine. Eggs scrambled to perfection, toast lightly buttered, coffee brewed strong enough to jolt a mortal into hyperawareness. The TV was on, muted at first, but curiosity made me flip up the volume as CNN’s bright red breaking news banner flashed.

**“Outbreak in Miami: Unknown Virus Spreads Rapidly,”** the chyron read. Images of chaotic hospital wards filled the screen, doctors and nurses wearing PPE that seemed inadequate against an unseen threat. My gut clenched. Decades of consuming zombie media had trained me for this moment, though I never imagined it would happen.

I turned off the TV. Denial is always the first step, isn’t it? Besides, there was work to be done. Publix doesn’t stock itself.

My job at Publix was both mundane and strangely fulfilling. Stocking shelves, managing the produce section, and occasionally running the register—it kept me hyper-grounded. Despite my immortality, I’d chosen this life for its simplicity. My coworkers, a mix of hardworking locals and teens saving for college, never suspected my secret. I was just Nick, the guy with an encyclopedic knowledge of cheese varieties and a knack for diffusing customer complaints.

I made $17.50 an hour—nothing extraordinary, but enough. My immortality came with a knack for long-term investments. The house, the car, my lifestyle—all paid for by centuries of careful planning. I drove a 2023 Subaru Outback, a reliable, fuel-efficient workhorse. Its metallic gray exterior blended perfectly with Miami’s urban sprawl. I always filled up at a Chevron on Coral Way, and if it was out of service, the BP two blocks over was my backup.

My home, nestled in a very quiet neighborhood, was a sanctuary. It had two bedrooms, a small but modern kitchen, a living room adorned with bookshelves and framed art from every era I’d lived through. The spare room doubled as a gym, with a Peloton bike, free weights, and a punching bag. The fridge and pantry were always stocked, a habit born of living through more historical upheavals than I cared to count.

The virus, later dubbed the Miami Flu, was like nothing humanity had ever faced. It didn’t spread rapidly in the traditional sense but was disturbingly methodical. Initial symptoms resembled the flu: fever, chills, and fatigue. By day three, victims exhibited hyper-aggression and an insatiable appetite for human flesh.

Scientists theorized that the virus triggered accelerated cell regeneration, which allowed the infected to heal rapidly and remain active despite catastrophic injuries. Unlike Hollywood’s undead, these infected were biologically alive but terrifyingly altered. Decomposition still occurred, but at a much slower rate, as the virus rebuilt tissues with chilling efficiency. They could run—fast. Not superhumanly fast, but enough to close the gap between predator and prey with terrifying speed.

More unnerving was their behavior. The infected were mindless, driven purely by hunger, yet displayed a disturbing capacity for adaptation. They rested during the night, entering a state of regenerative sleep that repaired injuries and preserved energy for the hunt.

Miguel arrived at my house around 2 PM, pounding on the door like a man possessed. He was drenched in sweat, his shirt torn, and his face a mask of barely contained panic.

**“Nick, it’s happening,”** he gasped. **“Just like you said it would. Zombies. Real fucking zombies.”**

I let him in, locking the door behind him and sliding the deadbolt.

**“They’re not zombies,”** I corrected, ever the pedant. **“They’re infected. There’s a difference.”**

Miguel glared at me. **“Now is not the time, bro.”**

We spent the next hour fortifying the house. My immortal status made me bold, but Miguel was mortal, and I wouldn’t let him die on my watch. The windows were boarded up using spare plywood from my garage. Furniture was rearranged to create choke points. We raided the pantry for supplies, assembling a makeshift survival kit: canned goods, bottled water, a flashlight, and my trusty baseball bat.

By nightfall, the city was unrecognizable. The Port of Miami burned, its towering cranes silhouetted against the flames. Highways were gridlocked with abandoned cars. Downtown was a war zone, the infected swarming through the streets like ants.

Social media painted a grim picture. Twitter was a mix of panic, misinformation, and gallows humor. A trending hashtag, #MiamiBites, showcased everything from blurry footage of the infected to memes about Florida Man thriving in the apocalypse. Local news stations struggled to keep up, their broadcasts devolving into frantic, unedited chaos as anchors fled mid-sentence.

As Miguel and I hunkered down, I couldn’t help but reflect on the absurdity of it all. This was every zombie movie trope come to life, yet the reality was far more terrifying. There were no heroic last stands, no charismatic leaders rallying survivors. The infected weren’t extras in makeup; they were former friends and neighbors. The film industry had lied to us, romanticizing survival while glossing over the sheer, unrelenting horror of it.",2,1736024392.0,postapocalyptic,0,1.0,False

1hto7i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1hto7i9/she_changed_my_life_by_marlon_ruck_as_told_to/,"""She Changed My Life"" by Marlon Ruck (as told to Wilson Adams)","Marlon was a twenty-four-year-old Catholic, home from the military, and living in Toledo, Ohio; Delores was eighteen, beautiful, and a member of the Lord's church. ""I was crazy about her from the beginning and asked her to marry me on our second date."" She refused. He kept asking. She kept refusing. ""We have too many differences,"" she said, ""mostly because you're Catholic.""

He worked hard at winning her over by winning over her parents. His persistence finally paid off as she accepted his proposal. Her parents were uneasy about the marriage although he promised them (and her) that he would make sure Delores got to church each week. ""I was not the least bit interested in going with her,"" he reminisces today, ""but I would not stand in her way.""

Sort of.

""I drank some in those days, "" he admits. Marlon would often keep Delores out late on Saturday nights in the hope that she would forget about church and they could sleep in. However, she always set her alarm and never forgot. Not once. ""Because of my promise, and because she didn't drive, I would drag out of bed and take her to church — sometimes with a hang-over from the night before.""

The scene replayed itself for a couple of years — ""my dropping her at the church building while I went to a restaurant to drink coffee and wait."" Eventually, Marlon eased up on the drinking and began to think: ""What does she have that I'm missing?"" One Sunday, he dropped her off, but instead of following the usual routine, he slipped into the back of the building and watched the service. ""She had no idea I was even there,"" he says.

Finally, he started going in and sitting with her. ""I defiantly refused to sing, even though I loved to sing and was fascinated by congregational singing."" One Sunday she caught him humming along and jammed an elbow into his side to make sure he knew... that she knew. ""To this day I can still feel her jab,"" he adds with a grin.

""Thinking back on it, I knew that if she missed one time, I had her. But she never did."" Eventually, her church friends became his friends. ""One fellow began to take an interest in me and we played golf together for the entire summer — although he never mentioned religion to me at all."" The two became close and as winter approached and the golf season ended, his friend asked, ""Do you have a Catholic Bible so we can compare?"" Marlon did and was more than eager to show his wife's church friend, and his golf friend, ""a thing or two.""

They studied together. ""Just like Delores,"" he notes, ""he never pushed."" ""We just studied and talked."" He then adds, ""I think one of the reasons the studies went so well was because he had taken the time to first become my friend."" Marlon told a neighbor by the name of Darrell (whose wife was also a Christian although he wasn't) about the study, and Darrell joined in also.

""One Sunday after Darrell and I had talked and knew what we needed to do, we both came forward during the invitation song. Neither of our wives knew of our decision and you can imagine the look on their faces — we totally surprised them!""

""Delores and I were married for forty-seven years until she passed away in April 2004. I am ashamed of the way I treated her in those early days — trying everything I could to get her to quit her faith."" But Delores didn't quit. ""Her godly example changed my whole life!"" He then adds with an aching sigh, ""I sure miss having her.""

I am reminded of *I Peter 3:1–2* — ""*In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, and they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.*""

I've heard great things about the clean tone of the Blues Cube (it's the older model, not the re-issue), but it's a touch more expensive than the Monoprice, and doesn't have a reverb tank, so that's another pedal I'd need. Love the general sound and feel of it though.

I'll mostly be playing at home in my apartment, but hoping to record and maybe play a small (porch or coffee-shop level) show one day in the future.

Currently I'd be running it mostly clean (only pedal I have is a Boss Tremolo), but hoping to build out my sound with pedals over the next year. Whichever one I get being a good pedal platform is important.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interest you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

I am moving to be closer to my kids and grandkids but we decided to keep the cabin and rent it out for a good part of the year. My family and I will also use it for weekend getaways as we will only be living just over an hour away. 
We are all big coffee drinkers so we know we want a dedicated coffee station. In our rental price point, a coffee station is also a useful amenity. I am trying to figure out the best place to set this up. When the remodel is done, there will be a dry bar in the great room and there will also be a small walk-in pantry in the kitchen. The pantry area is already plumbed so adding a sink is not going to break the bank, the dry bar in the living room is not in a spot that we can add a sink without significant cost. My place will sleep up to 10-12 guests, so I’m picturing busy mornings with people all getting up and trying to get coffee while others may be trying to prepare breakfast for a crowd. The coffee station in the great room will be out of the way, but I worry about people not being able to drop a mixing spoon in a sink or add water to a pot. However, if it’s it the walk in pantry, everyone will have to walk through the cooking and prep areas to get their coffee. Once they are in the pantry they are out of the way, but they do have to get there. Both areas will have room for cups and condiments and will also have space for a small fridge for creamers or whatever.

The Keurig K-Café’s ingenious design combines a single-serve coffee brewer with a built-in milk frother, allowing you to create café-quality lattes and cappuccinos with ease. Its key features include:

* **Single-Serve Brewing:**  Brew K-Cup pods for a quick and consistent cup of coffee.
* **Milk Frother:** Create rich, creamy froth for lattes and cappuccinos.
* **Water Reservoir:**  Provides ample water capacity for multiple brews.
* **Ground Coffee Option:**  Brew your favorite ground coffee using the provided filter basket (check your specific model for compatibility).

Before diving into troubleshooting, familiarize yourself with the official Keurig K-Café user guide. This document provides detailed setup instructions, specific troubleshooting steps, and important safety information.


### Troubleshooting Common Keurig K-Café Issues

Let's address some of the most frequently encountered problems with the Keurig K-Café:

#### **1. The Machine Won't Turn On:**

* **Check the Power:** Ensure the K-Café is securely plugged into a functioning electrical outlet.  Try a different outlet to rule out power issues.
* **Reset the Machine:**  Sometimes a simple reset can resolve the problem. Try unplugging the machine for several minutes, then plugging it back in.  For some models, simultaneously holding the power button and size buttons might also initiate a reset (consult your user manual for specific instructions).
* **Internal Issues:** If the problem persists, there might be an internal electrical fault. Contact Keurig customer support for assistance or consider professional repair.

#### **2.  Excessive or Inadequate Coffee Dispense:**

This often points to clogged needles.  Here's how to clean them:

* **Locate the Needles:** The entrance needle is located under the K-Cup holder lid, and the exit needle is on the bottom of the K-Cup holder itself.
* **Clean with a Paperclip:** Carefully straighten a paperclip and use it to gently clear any coffee grounds or debris from both needles.  Be gentle to avoid damaging the needles.
* **Rinse Thoroughly:** Run a couple of water-only brew cycles to flush out any remaining particles.

#### **3. """"Add Water"""" Light Despite a Full Reservoir:**

* **Check Reservoir Placement:**  Make sure the water reservoir is correctly seated and the magnetic contacts are properly aligned.  A slightly misaligned reservoir can prevent the machine from detecting the water level.
* **Clean the Reservoir and Filter:**  Remove and thoroughly clean the water reservoir and filter with warm soapy water. Rinse well and ensure everything is completely dry before reinstalling.  Mineral deposits can interfere with the water level sensor.
* **Sensor Issues:** If the problem persists, the water level sensor itself might be malfunctioning.  Contact Keurig support for assistance.


#### **4.  Weak or Inconsistent Brewing:**

* **Water Quality:** Hard water can lead to mineral buildup, affecting brewing performance.  Consider using filtered water.
* **K-Cup Issues:** Ensure you're using K-Cups compatible with your K-Café model.  Damaged or improperly sealed K-Cups can also lead to weak brews.
* **Descaling:**  Regular descaling is crucial to maintain optimal brewing performance.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions using a Keurig-approved descaling solution.


### Descaling and Maintenance: Keeping Your K-Café in Top Shape

Regular descaling and cleaning are vital for extending the lifespan of your Keurig K-Café and ensuring consistently delicious brews.  Follow these steps:


* **Descaling:**  Consult your user manual for specific instructions and the recommended frequency.  Generally, descaling every 3-6 months (or more frequently if you use hard water) is recommended.
* **Cleaning the Frother:** After each use, especially when frothing milk, thoroughly clean the frother wand with warm soapy water and a non-abrasive brush or sponge.  Allow it to air dry completely.
* **Cleaning the Exterior:**  Wipe down the exterior of the machine regularly with a damp cloth.


###  Delicious Keurig K-Café Recipe Ideas

Beyond basic coffee, your K-Café can create a variety of specialty drinks. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

#### **1. Classic Latte:**

* Brew a single shot of espresso (or strong coffee).
* Steam 3-4 ounces of milk until it's hot and slightly foamy.
* Pour the steamed milk over the espresso.
* Top with a thin layer of microfoam (created by swirling the milk in the frother).

#### **2. Creamy Cappuccino:**

* Brew a single shot of espresso.
* Froth 1-2 ounces of milk until it's light and airy.
* Steam 2-3 ounces of milk separately.
* Layer the frothed milk on top of espresso, followed by the steamed milk.

#### **3.  Mocha:**

* Brew a single shot of espresso.
* Add 1-2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup or cocoa powder.
* Steam and froth milk as desired.


#### **4.  Flavored Lattes:**

Experiment with different flavorings like vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, or pumpkin spice syrups to customize your lattes.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:  Can I use any type of milk in the frother?**

A: While most types of milk work,  whole milk generally produces the best froth.  Avoid using ultra-high-temperature (UHT) processed milk, as it may not froth as well.

**Q: How often should I descale my Keurig K-Café?**

A: The frequency depends on your water hardness.  Aim for every 3-6 months, or more often if you notice a decline in brewing quality or mineral buildup.


**Q: What should I do if my K-Café starts leaking?**

A:  A leak usually indicates a problem with the water reservoir or internal seals. Contact Keurig support or a qualified repair technician.


By following these tips and troubleshooting methods, you can ensure your Keurig K-Café continues to deliver delicious coffee drinks for years to come. Remember, regular maintenance and proper cleaning are key to maintaining optimal performance and extending the life of your machine.

It's been 3 months since the break up and I still think about her all the time. I have good days and bad days, but the dominant feeling I have now is restlessness. I'm not as sad or angry or disappointed anymore, I just feel like I've got ants in my pants! I think about her all the time and I really want to talk to her - but not about the breakup or about our issues. I really just want to talk to her like how we used to talk. I want to know how her day was, I want to know how her Christmas was, I want to joke around and plan things together. She was my best friend and I really miss her.

So I'm kinda struggling to manage the restlessness. I can't sit still for 5 minutes without fidgeting, looking at my phone and eventually getting up and pacing around the room or going for some random errand. If I don't move I'll be on the brink of anxiety and panic attacks. I've started running a lot which has helped loads. I've also joined a squash club, stopped drinking coffee and alcohol, been spending lots of time with friends, doing yoga, going for a morning walk, and I've started learning a language lol. These things have helped loads and I'd recommend them to others! But I'm still struggling to keep it at bay when I'm idle. 

So I was wondering if anyone else went through a similar thing and had any suggestions? Was there something you did, or something you avoided, that really helped? Or is it just a case of waiting it out? 😅 Any advice appreciated!",1,1736023251.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Challenges:

1. Starbucks Partnership in the U.S. demanded more supply than Oatly could handle, forcing them to redirect supply from Europe and China, stalling growth in these regions.

2. Global Disruptions—the war in Ukraine, container shortages, and the Suez Canal blockage—added to their woes.

 

The Turnaround:

They have had losses, but are turning the ship around:

* Supply chain fixed with Utah and Canada suppliers.
* Costs under control
* All regions now profitable at segment level – more growth seen in Belgium, France, and Spain. Launches in Poland and Mexico.
* Cash burn improving significantly

 

1. The Broad market view:

* Plant-based trend continues growing
* Food service expansion ramping up
* Strong brand in a massive market
* ESG plays getting more attention
* Institutional interest likely to grow as financials improve

 

2.      Management is Actually Executing:

* Cost initiatives working

\*  Strategic reset in China successful -  Oatly is refocusing on oat milk and partnering with major chains like Starbucks, KFC, and Luckin Coffee (20,000+ locations). 

* Distribution expanding
* New product innovation pipeline strong

\*   $119M cash on hand

 

 

Another potential uptrend is the H1N1 outbreak hitting dairy farmers. Regular milk could get very expensive and a rising tide lifts all boats in the Vegan/Plant market.  Alternative forms of milk will be priced competitively before the end of 2025.

Can it squeeze up some more?

1htnovg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1htnovg/how_to_handle_a_friendship_betrayal/,How to handle a friendship betrayal?,"So for context, I have been friends with this person for around 10 years. Pretty close friends, to the point that I considered them to be unofficial family. Over these 10 years they have moved away for 2 years at a time twice and a third time for around a year. While they have lived away, I didn't hear from them all that much. Sometimes not for months. Which is fine. I'm the sort of person that understands that people have lives and get busy and am happy to just pick up where we left off next time we speak. This works well for a lot of my friends, particularly those who do shift work which impacts their ability to ""hang out"" all the time. 

More recently, this friend moved close by to me. Due to proximity, we've spent more time together and have generally been more in contact. Also fine. 

More context before I get into the root issue. This friend has a drinking problem and a while ago asked me if I would support them to go to AA. I looked up an open meeting and accompanied them there, made sure they felt comfortable with the group and they were doing a lot better while they weren't drinking. Hanging out was a lot more fun, still did the same thing of watching movies etc, but didn't result in them pouring me overly strong drinks that makes me sick. 

They did that for a few months and then decided ""I'm not as bad as those other people"" and started drinking again. With the drinking came the behaviours again. If I hang out with them, I remind them that I don't like strong drinks, but by drink 3, I'm sick. They think it's ok to slap me in the face when they are drinking. They speak about all sorts of rubbish on topics they know nothing about and it's just easier to smile and nod because they won't listen to reason if you try to have a logical discussion with them. 

Anyway, a couple of months back, I went over to hang out. Same old story, poured my drinks too strong, I was a bit down at the time and had a bit of a vent about life in general, and how it all feels pointless. Like every time I get a better job that pays more, the price of things goes up so I feel like I'm never really getting ahead and I'm exhausted by working so hard for things to never get better. 

A whole 5 days later, I get a message from another friend (we'll call this one Friend B - who friend in question has only met once) saying ""dude are you okay? I just got a message from (friend A) saying they need to call me about you because they are worried"". I figured it was about what I'd said 5 days earlier and yep, could accept that perhaps my phrasing of it wasn't the best, but we've had this same conversation multiple times over the years and Friend A has never felt the need to contact my other friends about it.

Friend B messaged me later and basically confirmed that Friend A had disclosed the private conversation we'd had days earlier. I reassured Friend B that I had just been venting and it seemed strange that Friend A had contacted her when Friend A knows of other friends that I speak to more often who would be more appropriate to ask to check in on me if they were genuinely worried, and also the timeline of waiting 5 days if you are that worried is strange. 

A couple of days later, Friend B filled me in on the rest of the conversation. Not only had they told her what I'd said that night, but they also told her some very personal things that had happened to me years before. The sort of things that you just don't tell people about. Friend A had also gone on to bag out one of my closest friends to Friend B. Further, Friend A made out like I was ""dating multiple people at once"" because I had told them that I had been on a handful of coffee dates with people from a dating site - which ended there. Just coffee.  

Not only that, but Friend A also shared a ridiculous plan that I should have a baby with them and they can't understand why I won't. Context to this, I have spoken to them a few times about the fact that I haven't found the right person and I want to be able to have a family, but am reaching an age where I am starting to run out of time to do everything properly. Their solution is to co-parent a child, which completely misses the point that I want the full package. Friend B and I have had this same conversation and she agrees that I am entitled to want the full package of a family and told friend A as much. I had always rejected the idea and made it clear ""that's not what I want"" but tolerated this conversation from Friend A until this point because I thought it was a joke. Along the lines of ""let's start a cult"". Something we joke about occasionally but don't actually intend to do. But the fact that they brought it up to Friend B makes me worry they think this is actually a good idea. 

So after hearing all the rest of this, Friend B and I came to the conclusion that Friend A was not actually worried, but was just drunk and felt like gossiping. Trust broken. 

Friend A has often gossiped about their other friends to me in the past and silly me thought it was one of those situations where I was in on the joke but that they wouldn't do the same to me. Now I am questioning who else has been told intimate details about my personal life that were discussed in confidence. And phrased in such an inaccurate and derogatory way. 

So basically, I decided to take a bit of a step back from the friendship. 10 years is a lot of time to just throw away, but I don't feel like I can trust this person anymore, and need some time to figure out whether to continue any form of friendship with them. 

After the weekend where Friend B had filled me in on the rest, Friend A calls me and starts asking about if I've been on any more dates and what I'd been up to for the weekend. Seemed strange to me since they had been so judgemental about the handful of coffee dates I'd been on previously, so I lied and told them I'd been sick in bed all weekend. I had been sick, but had managed to pull myself together to see a friend on the weekend. Again, trust broken, none of their business. 

Since then, Friend A has been trying to call me more than ever before in the history of the friendship. I started rejecting the calls because I was annoyed at them for speaking badly about me then calling to dig for information on the same thing they'd been so judgemental behind my back about. They asked me why I'm not picking up, and I told them that they keep calling at bad times (true) and that I figured if it was important they would send a follow up text. They seemed to shrug it off but then continued with the calls, which I continued to reject. I was communicating with them via message only. I did answer one call, in which they just asked me a stupid question that they could have easily googled. That also annoyed me. So I stopped answering again. 

Then I get another message ""you've never rejected so many calls in the history of our friendship, what's going on"". I told them I was trying to sleep at the time they had called (true) and that I don't like speaking over the phone and would prefer a message so I can get back to them when I have time. They seemed to accept that. 

They backed off for a bit, then the phone calls recommenced. Along with irritating messages. Bringing up the stupid baby idea. I didn't respond to that message. Then pressuring me to commit to plans with them months ahead of time to go to some shows. I told them I'd have to see if I could afford to at the time. 

I was feeling smothered and it almost seemed like they were trying to call so much because they knew they stuffed up and wanted to try and see if Friend B had told me or not. 

Then something really bad happened. Someone I was really close to died suddenly. The day I found out I had another friend with me. Friend A sent me a text message. I didn't respond immediately, so within 5mins they tried calling. I let the phone ring out. Then about 2 minutes later they sent me a message on Facebook. And it wasn't an emergency, it was a ""hey, what are you doing next couple of weeks"". 3 forms of communication within 10 minutes for something unimportant seems a bit much to me. 

Due to no longer trusting Friend A and due to their penchant for making inappropriate comments about things, I didn't want to tell them what had happened, but decided I couldn't deal with them while grieving. 

Because I didn't respond, they tried calling me the following day. And again, the day after. I ended up restricting them on Facebook so they can't call me through messenger and I won't see their messages if they try to message. Just can't deal with them right now. They've since sent me 2 text messages now asking why I'm ignoring them. 

They also contacted Friend B again to ask why I'm ignoring them. I hadn't told Friend B what had happened yet at that point so she told them she didn't know and genuinely didn't at that point. 

So. The question is, do I let Friend A know that I know what they've said about me? Friend B is a bit concerned that Friend A will have a go for telling me since Friend A had said to her ""oh, don't tell her I called you, she hates being talked about"". Or do I just tell them a half truth of ""You haven't respected my boundaries about the phone calls, I'm dealing with personal stuff and work stuff right now and need space""? Or third option, just continue to ignore them? I am a little concerned that they might just rock up at my door demanding answers, in which case I don't know if I'll be able to be civil or if they'll cop a mouthful. 

They really aren't my priority right now, but don't seem willing to drop it until I respond. Honestly, I've been barely able to function since getting the news and having to deal with funeral arrangements etc, otherwise I would have responded to the first message by now. 

The message they sent tonight was well after midnight, which isn't cool as well. Like, they should know I'm trying to sleep at this time. I haven't been able to sleep hence seeing the message, but that's besides the point. It's not an ideal time to initiate contact with someone.

So I believe his product is superior in my area.

The thing is, I’ve never done sales, and I have no idea who would want to buy. Do I talk to coffee shop owners who already have established relationships with their preferred roasters? How do I let them know that our coffee is better than what they serve without being rude? And how do I convince them that they even need a higher quality product? Is it enough to say that they’ll sell more coffee if their customers like it more?
Or should I look for people who are about to open a coffee shop who don’t have a supplier yet?

What about other businesses? What kinds of businesses make good wholesale clients?

Probably Costco is doing this to enhance the health of its members \[not really, the actual reason is abuse of the grinders by members, but the side-effect could be positive\].

The antioxidant properties of coffee, as well as the other health benefits, are lost when the coffee is ground even just hours before being brewed, let alone days before it is used. The flavor also suffers when coffee is ground a long time before being used. .

The best option is to get rid of your Keurig or automatic coffee maker and properly do single-pour:

1. Put a single pour #2 cone filter in a ceramic coffee cone (rinse the filter firsts)
2. Place the cone over a ceramic mug
3. Heat water to 190°F in a gooseneck kettle (you can get an electric, temperature-controlled, gooseneck kettle to simplify things). While some people advocate 205°F, at 190 you avoid the need to wait for the outgassing in the bloom.
4. In a conical burr grinder, grind enough medium roast coffee beans for your cup or mug
5. Place the ground coffee into the coffee cone
6. Pour the water slowly over the ground coffee, washing down the grinds at the upper part of the filter (gently stirring the water and coffee mixture is also recommended)

I usually like to have a low key first date where I like to focus on getting to know the person better. So, I did ask her out and suggested we could meet for coffee or dinner or do something like a walk or a hike. She insisted on dinner, so I suggested we meet at a place where the ambiance is good for conversation and pretty good food. She stated that the restaurant was not ""classy"" and asked me to suggest a ""classier"" place. That seemed a little odd to me, but I decided to play along and suggested another restaurant which is also supposed to be a good date place and with a more expensive menu. I usually offer to pay for dinner and I was planning on doing that in this case as well.

He's been nothing but kind and open-minded and respectful of me and my limits. FYI I'm a 32F with multiple chronic pain diagnosis and I'm demisexual (he knows about both), but I also got BPD and PMDD which he doesn't know about.

We're supposed to go on a chill date tomorrow, just drinking coffee and chatting, but I got into my luteal phase yesterday and it's making me feel so depressed and irritable. I'm usually so into him and We're always flirting and everything flows so smoothly, but since I entered my luteal phase just reading his messages or seeing his face gives me the ick and it makes me feel awful. We were both so excited for our date, but now I feel like I should cancel cause my PMDD is making me split on him.

Idk what to do...I'm such a mess of a human being, how can I ever get into a relationship with someone with all the shit that's wrong with me. That's so unfair to them.

My partner and I are currently on our second worldpackers stay. We are in the Peruvian Amazon, staying at an eco lodge where we are managing their social medias for a little over a week.

Everything has been going well, but by our third day here the WiFi stopped working. This is now day #4 without Wifi and we have been unable to do any of the work expected as we use a tablet for the design work we are doing and have no way of transferring photos/videos nor using the editing apps without wifi.

The host hasn’t seemed to mind that we haven’t posted at all during these last few days (as I explained that we need wifi to do the work), but I don’t know if we should be offering to do extra work for the days that we didn’t have wifi. 

Each day we have politely checked in about the wifi, and each day the host took longer and longer to respond, without giving any real updates. They said the wifi should be back tonight… as we are in the jungle I completely understand some inconsistency with internet, but it’s been almost our whole stay and the post said it had reliable internet suited for remote work (and suited for the work they are asking of us!)

After today, we have 3 more days here. Should we offer to make extra content for the days the internet was out (assuming we do get it back before our stay is over)? Or just make our normal amount each day we have wifi? The host hasn’t said anything about what she expects but unsure if I should offer or not. 


Also- we are in a fairly remote place so it isn’t easy for us to go to town and find a coffee shop etc to do the work! ",2,1736022214.0,Worldpackers,1,1.0,False

I said that isn't a real apology because he is blaming _me_ for him breaking my attachment.
He apologized again but also doubled down on it not being a good place to store it since it literally just got broken even though nothing has ever been broken outside aside from him dropping his phone on it.

On the drive back to (my) home she ignored me for most of the time other than occasionally reminding me of how much her ""real men"" were going to enjoy the underwear that she'd 'let' me buy fer her. 

""Im just imagining how Simons gigantic rock hard cock is going to feel fucking me tonight in my new lingerie"".

""Dave, will go fucking wild when I tell him you've paid for the underwear that he likes so much. He really gets off on me treating you like shit"". 

""If you're good and you beg hard enough, I might let you buy some of my old stuff to 'wash' as a treat"". 

Although her words hurt they aroused me even more than I already was. I knew now that I wasn't worthy of actually being sexually involved with her, but I couldn't help myself from wanting her to use me like a cash dispensary and a toy to humiliate for her fun.  And when she said that my suffering turned her on I became desperate to suffer for her. 

Immediately we reached my place I jumped out to open the door for her then dashed to open the house door for her before going back to the car for all her shopping. 

""Do you intend to keep me waiting forever? Coffee, now""!

She walked off into the lounge as I carfuly put the shopping down to make her coffee.

""Why am I waiting for my shopping, get it in here double quick""! 

Kettle on, I took the bags to her.

That finger click.

""Get my things out, put them here where I can open them and we can go through the receipts. I want to know how much I've let you spend on me"". 

Once everything was unpacked and laid out and she had her coffee I knelt beside her chair as she reviewed the days purchase.

Three pairs of shoes
Two pairs pairs of jeans
Two dresses
Four skirts
Three tops
Two vibrating sex toys
Three lingerie sets.
£476 

""You can give me the cash to round that up to a £500 day"". 

I thanked her for taking some of my savings prompting her to laugh in my face. 

""I've only just started, you're going to be bankrupt when I get through with you"".

For the next half hour she looked at her new clothing while I was totally ignored, until.....

""Go fetch me a lenth of thin rope or something, it's loser wanking time"". 

Eager for my reward I ran to the garage and cut a three feet length off chord, quickly returning to her side to hand it over. 

""Ok, strip. Stand there, hands on head"".

Pointing to the ground ground in front of her seat. 

""Fucking hell!  Did that stop developing when you were 5!? Its more like a fucking skin tag than a cock""! 

Those words were destroying to my already crushed ego. 

""Fasten this end of the chord to your wrist on your wanking hand"" 

I did as she said, puzzled why.

Standing there naked with my hands on my head while she mocked my manhood left no doubt in my mind that I meant nothing to her, in her eyes I was a weak loser who's only use was as a wallet and a fool to abuse and for her amusement.

I loved her, I loved her with every fiber of my being. 

""Ok loser, wanky time. I don't think I can look at you for long without without puking, so make it fast. And dont you fucking dare spew that slime without asking for permission first. GO"".

Standing there like a pathetic old fool I began masturbating. She looked on with an air of disinterest. Playing her end of the chord through her fingers.

""Fucking hell, how long does it take for a virgin to wank itself off?  Come on finish will you. its vile""  

Her insults made me wank faster and harder as I reached my ending. Breathing hard, grunting and panting, more animal than man.  She sat looking at me, unmoved, uncaring, like it was an inconvenience to her having to witness witness my degrading display. 

With a gasp I begged her to allow me to cum.

""Please, I beg you for permission to cum, please please may I cum""

Right on the point of orgasm she laughed,

She shouted at me

""If you have to...""

Before yanking hard on the chord, jerking my hand away from my cock! 
My cock jerking about trying to feel the friction that had vanished! 

My cum dribbling out as spasms of pain ran through my prostate. 

She was in fits of laughter watching me thrusting into nothing as  my ruined orgasm dripped out of me. 

""Hahaha, fucking fabulous! You actually thought I was going to let you enjoy a wank!  The only pleasure you get is pleasing me. 
Now, get down and lick up that slime then get in your corner. 

Simon will be here soon, Im going to fuck his brains out in your bed"".

I've been taking Elvanse since late September. I started on 30mg, then up to 50mg, and about two weeks ago I started 70mg, along with a 10mg Amfexa top up.

  
I've been finding that I end up feeling a lot more anxious and crashing hard in the afternoons. This tends to go away as I get used to the medication. It wasn't too bad on 30mg, on 50 it could be rough especially if I had caffeine, but I got used to it and I don't remember feeling too bad the final few weekends.

  
Now on 70mg Elvanse, and man today sucked (Saturday). I made sure I had a protein shake and some toast soon after taking it but my mind started racing at 100MPH about random shit on Reddit (ugh) and soon I was just riddled with anxiety. I ended up doing nothing all day but feeling like shit.

  
I drink decaf coffee with my breakfast, and I'm unsure if that might be a cause. Perhaps its poorly roasted? 

  
It's just really strange because I've felt fine at work. Really focused, energetic. But it's always been the weekends that trip me up, and it seems to be the case again with this increase.

  
Does anyone here have any advice/thoughts? Again, I felt that way before on lower doses but then got used to it. Is it just a question of adapting do you think? Or should I lower doses? It's worth noting I've been coming off Sertraline the past two weeks or so as well.

  
I'm asking because I'm worried about taking my meds tomorrow :( I have one leftover 50mg tablet, so I may just take that.

**What nickname or handle do you primarily use?**

OK, now online in the realms of artistry and such I go by the handle Graph1ks, mostly coming from the point that when I started using this nickname I was more focused on image editing and photo manipulation, but once music came along I thought that Graph1ks makes sense even there, as it relates pretty well to lyrics and songs I produce. I have a side project, or rather my main project now, called DARK:S¥N, under which I produce full albums of raw goodness. Basically, ""what if Graph1ks wasn't one guy, but a whole band and they were from Berlin and had all some really strong life experience"" kind of thing - just to further get a bit of my creativity out there.

Hello dear readers! I'm Graph1ks, a guy from Germany in my mid-40s who has always been passionate about creatively expressing themself, but not in the realm of music and songwriting. It was more around storytelling and photoshop. Imagine being bitten by the roleplaying bug but you could never let go - that's me. Well, part of me at least. I enjoy reading (or enjoyed, considering I haven't really done that much of it recently) a lot, although books got slowly replaced by ebooks and online media. I enjoy my TV shows and movies, of course, mostly sci-fi or fantasy, but sprinkled in with real-world drama and a smudge of courtroom dramas. I grew up in a household filled and surrounded by dogs all my life, either because we had dogs around my parents or because close relatives were breeding and training dogs. Now cue me, moving out and living on my own and suddenly realizing that with a full-time job, taking care of a dog is much harder. So I opted for what I didn't get at first: Cats. BUT, my first cat, an old-style Siamese cat, broke the walls and here I am - proud cat owner, unless he decides to put his paw into my mouth while I sleep. Which either means my snoring is annoying him or he wants me dead. Professionally, my career went a different direction compared to my hobbies but sure involved a huge amount of coordination and communication, that much I can say.

**What's one thing you're genuinely passionate about outside of music and AI? Give us a glimpse into your other interests!**

As mentioned at the beginning, it's sure a couple of things: Living Life, Happiness and Friends in a nutshell are top priorities, although I must confess I'm slacking in all 3 departments for a while now. Beside these big three I hope to focus on more, it's sure a mix of things considering how much time AI and music are taking up now of my time. If I had to rank it, based on my time spent, which must mean I'm passionate about it, I'd say it's watching and consuming movies and novels etc., followed by staying informed about politics, playtime with my cat, and cooking :D

# Your Musical Journey

**Have you always been vibing with music? Tell us about your history with music, whether it's banging on pots and pans or mastering a flute at your grandmas christmas celebration.**

Yes, i'd say. Music is my go-to when it comes to trying to get into a certain mood, trying to concentrate on things, or simply try to relax.

Is that the right time to mention I have Aphantasia and maybe that's why I'm more drawn to lyrics compared to just visuals? Anyway - let's not talk about the fact I was insanely surprised that ""I can see it in my mind"" wasn't meant just as a figure of speech...

I didn't play any instruments in my life, beside some forced flute - which I hated with a passion. Not cause I hated music, but because someone told me I have to. I dabbled a bit with sampling a long while ago, but otherwise rather remained on the consumer side. There was also a brief time I worked on a Gothic Webradio (man, wasn't that a time those were popular? Anyone still using Winamp?) and had my own show and tried to combine listening to music and popping out some news.

Wild stuff, I tell ya :D

**Who are some of your biggest musical inspirations, past or present? What is it about their work that resonates with you?**

I grew up listening to German rap music. Artists like Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt, Die Fantastischen Vier, Fresh Familee, MC Rene, Ferris MC, Massive Töne etc. - fast forward a bit, and what CD was the first I bought? Queen - Greatest Hits! Well, that didn't make sense but sure made perfect sense once I listened to them. Just one of the greatest bands EVER!

But at some point in my early 20s I got bit by the dark, devouring, caressing and loving deep dark lands that love being devoid of color, but full of emotion. The Gothic scene and all its dark brothers and sisters that surround it. The list of bands is long - Deine Lakaien, Sisters of Mercy, Combichrist, Suicide Commando, Wumpscut, VNV Nation, KMFDM, Haujob, Type O Negative, The 69 Eyes, Paradise Lost, London After Midnight, Placebo, Das Ich, Goethes Erben, Die Krupps, In Strict Confidence, Agonoize... not to mention Metallica, Blind Guardian, Running Wild, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, Saltatio Mortis, Tanzwut... *takes a deep breath*... you see my problem!? MY PROBLEM!? :D

BUT - if I had to select 3 bands or artists I think I would select the following:

* Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt - because it was the first band I fell in love with and to this day, slightly follow up on what some of them are doing. Aggressive lyrics, really fat and nicely sampled songs.
* Queen - Because they showed me that I don't have to be stuck in loving only one kind of music - but whatever moves or touches me. Diverse, poetic lyrics and a huge range of emotions to explore. Love it!
* And One - Because they're such a nice blend of different genres and I just fell in freaking love with Steve Naghavi's vocal performances. Those beats, that voice... just a captivating and inspiring combination for sure!

(I want to apologize to all the great bands I didn't pick at the top 3, but let's be honest. I was forced at gunpoint to pick three and I fumbled. Ask me tomorrow and it might look different. IT'S HARD MAN!)

**Is there a particular song or album that had a profound impact on you and your relationship with music? Tell us the story!**

I think that will be Blind Guardian and Somewhere Far Beyond (and of course later Nightfall in Middle-Earth). I can't even recount the amount of times this album was the background track to sleepless nights, cheap drinks, and insane amounts of dice rolled and characters lost. To me - this album is a connection to past times with friends, lost and beloved, as well as shared memories of laughter (and short sadness... RIP Barios Thunderhoove!) and high energy... or low - when 6 people cramped into a room were snoring and sleeping.

Isn't it weird that my answers are all over the place but in my head make perfect sense?

# AI Music Perspectives

**Let's talk AI vs. the OG human jams. What are your thoughts on AI music compared to traditional music? No wrong answers, just your honest takes.**

AI music for me is the best sliced bread I've eaten in a long while! It's fresh, easily digestible, and funny enough, only gets better over time! Do I feel that AI shouldn't create music that reproduces exactly the same songs and vocals that living and breathing musicians have?

100%. I think those musicians deserve to be who they are and their voices be their own.

At the same time, I believe as long as the AI is able to produce voices that aren't associated with them and creates music that might have a similar tone and style but also creates their own unique versions out of it, it's totally fine to exist and be used to create new original tracks.

I don't want my songs to sound like Metallica or Snoop or Eminem or Beyoncé. I just want them to sound GOOD - whatever that means to my ears or to yours. The whole industry is moving faster than anything that came before.

So while people tend to be worried about the impact of AI on music, I'm actually pretty excited because for me AI is a tool - not a replacement.

**Crystal ball time! Do you see AI taking over the whole music scene, or will humans always have their place on the stage (or in the studio)? Share your predictions and why you think so.**

Humans will 100% always have their place. Fans will always exist.

I think it's just not enough RIGHT NOW to just be a good musician in the first place. You also need to be good to promote yourself, to interact with the world around you, and know how to reach your audiences. AI is for sure going to have a bigger impact, once the current limitations fade away and it gains bigger acceptance in the industry once openly AI-generated tracks (partially or full) will top the charts and offer new combinations of genres and music that people didn't think they needed in their lives but heck - HERE IT IS! AND WE LOVE IT!

AI can inspire humans as much as humans ""inspired"" AI to be what it is.

**What are some of the most exciting possibilities you see for the future of AI in music creation? What innovations are you hoping to witness?**

Take the music right out of my brain, sir! STOP LOOKING IN THAT DARK CORNER! That's private! Stop going through my memories of... oh dear god, is it going to sample the sound of me tripping up completely drunk screaming in a karaoke bar, isn't it?

# Your AI Music Journey

**When did you first stumble into the world of AI music generation? Give us the origin story! What was your initial reaction?**

Early december 2023 was the first time i stumbled upon the recent generation of AI music. I was aware of Ai music for a while, but only in creating very toned down instrumental tracks of questionable quality.

But after i listened to, at that time SUNO, for the first time i was blown the hell away. I discovered a new passion and a new love. A way i could put all my love, hate, doubt and depression in and just start releasing things into the world that moved me - or that i simply had to voice. It's so much better than actually eating it all up or screaming at the walls - trust me. If you haven't done that yet and created your own AI music - you should!

**What was the moment you decided to jump in and start making your own AI music? What got you hyped, and what were your first creations like?**

I made a couple of songs with different prompts but wasn't impressed by the lyrics. So in late december i started writing and from there on it was just a journey up hill, pushing that huge boulder of unknowns and insecurities and slowly seeing pieces of it crumble away and my journey becoming easier and easier. It turns out, that while having a knack or a ""talent"" for things is nice, not giving up, showing ambition and desire to improve is as valueable as constant... CONSTANT repetition.

**Walk us through your usual process when you're cooking up tunes with AI. What are the smooth moves, and what are the head-scratching moments? Are there any specific tools or techniques you rely on?**

Well i can't take you through the whole process, but it often just starts with me having an idea about a chorus, a song title or a topic. I generally like writing things that tell a story. I think that's the 90s deep inside me that i can't shake. When i see artist releasing a 1:58min song and calling that a full song i cringe hard and a little bit of my dies a painful death. Once i have the first spark and idea, i sit down and try to think about how i want the story to progress. What's the message? Does it have a final conclusion? Is it a snippet? And after that i just start writing line after line, often not even a rhyme but simple phrases and ideas. And over time, it develops into a more complete picture.

When i started, my personal knowledge about what word rhymes with which was TINY and i still would call it ""a minor knowledge base still in huge development"", but when i get stuck i apply all the tools available to me. My first go to is often Rhymezone, cause it's really a nice database for all these things. When it comes to metaphors or idioms its harder, but i'll sure work my way through. There is fun stuff like ""the mind is a metaphor"" but to not beat around the bush, i of course use AI to help me find words or phrases i'm simply not aware of.

While working on the lyrics, i decide how detailed i want the song - how much i have to tell. Does it need a pre-chorus? should i rather aim for 2 verses and a chorus? What about a post-chorus? a refrain maybe as well or breakdown instead of a bridge section? I think it needs some air between the verses... So once i have ""ready to go"" set of lyrics for the song i spin up my AI music gen software of choice, at the moment it's UDIO, and work creating the songs.

In basically every song i notice that some phrases are too long or too short or that ""Hey, you know what would sound better?"" and apply that. So working on the lyrics only stops when i have finished a song. While generating the music in the AI, i test different prompts and fine tune the song hunting for the right one - the first base track that screams at me ""THAT'S IT!"" and from there on i work towards the next steps. This can either be me working verse by verse, or taking the first two lines of a verse that got created and extend from there - to capture a different tonality - a different way the lyrics are pronounced or sung.

The hardest struggle is often the initial track and the chorus. Cause i need my choruses to hit me and feel right. So i'm usually very picky about them. If i'd have to calculate - out of a standard PRO subscription i get about 10-14 finished songs. The rest is just repetition and garbage i delete. The final song, exluding all the creations i deleted and dropped, 15..20 or 30 individual extensions (or more - i don't count them on a regular). So most songs take me a good couple of hours of focused prompting to finish in AI. Afterwards, for all major releases, i STEM the songs and mix and master them in a DAW to give it a slight polishing.

Once that is finished - its up onto artwork, video creation etc. which also takes hours.

# Your Musical Style & Future AI

**Most creators have their go-to musical flavors. How would you describe the kind of music you love making with AI? What are the key elements of your style?**

All the genres i grew up with honestly. Beside rap maybe. It's the utmost pain to write and every rapper deserves a gold medal honestly.

What i like though, about my current DARK:S¥N project is that i have set myself up with a group of base voices that reflect each vocal fictional team member and explore the music based on these conditions. It's a blend of dark synth-pop with ebm, darkwave and clear industrial vibes. Clear elements to explore the dark side of human nature, human emotions, passions, desires.. that's why the first album for it was called ""Sins"" and the album after ""Virtues"" and now the third album i'm working on is called ""Sinners & Saints"".

Is it weird that i planned out like 10 album titles? :D

**If you had the power to build the ultimate AI music sidekick, what are a few key things it absolutely must do better than current AIs? Dream big and list a few crucial improvements!**

My ultimate AI sidekick would talk to me, look over my shoulder and sprinkle in ideas and thoughts when i ask him. I would be able to add minute details and changes in real time, be able to tell him ""i want the chorus to be like this."" and hum him some broken sung version or changes to the original and it would adjust to that. I'd be easily able to mix genres or add changes to the bass or ensemble in real time. But that's years away. Ask me again in 5 years how far we've come.

**Are there any specific musical genres or styles you're particularly excited to explore with AI in the future? What musical frontiers are you hoping to reach?**

On the top of my head, i'd like to create a symphonic metal album, a ""IN TAVERNA"" style medieval fantasy album about drinking songs and just keep enhancing my own blend of various genres that i can ""call me own"" in some shape or form.

# The Unexpected One

**If you could have a conversation with any fictional musical instrument (like the Magic Flute or the Singing Sword), which one would you choose, and what's the first burning question you'd ask it?**

I would for sure wanna talk to the Bone Organ of the Goonies after it got a Synth upgrade. The amount of chilling tales it would be able to tell, the soul trapped inside of it... i think my first question would be ""Can you tell me about your life?"" if i have enough thought and i'm not geeking out. Otherwise it might end up being a simple stupid thing like. ""Wow nice to meet you, how are you doing?"" - what a silly question to ask a skeleton, hm? or not? *ponders*

# Open Mic

**This is your open mic moment! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the** r/GeneratedGrooves **community? This could be anything at all – promote your own music or projects, shout out a fellow creator, pose a burning question to the community, challenge another AI music artist to a friendly musical duel, share a random thought about AI, the future of music, or even your favorite brand of coffee. The stage is yours!**

First of all i wanna say i hate the guy who came up with this idea. (Wait what.. that was me? Really? Well proves the point that i hate myself a bit... kinda old news but ok.). But beside that i just hope you guys are all doing good. If not, i hope you know how to let go, release the pain and be able to work through your struggles. I for sure feel you. BUT - there is always sunshine after the rain. Every hill you climb will offer you a sweet view and a hill top moment, just don't take the roller coaster rides down and the stairs uphill.

1htn5k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1htn5k2/moving_to_sf_and_overwhelmed_by_the_neighborhood/,Moving to SF and overwhelmed by the neighborhood options.,"Hello everyone,

I'm a newly graduated doctor planning to move to San Francisco soon, and I could really use some advice on where to live. I have gone through several ""Top Lists"" around looking for options, but the definitions of these neighborhoods are so nebulous, so I do not know what is the real deal with these places. 

I’ll be looking to rent a one-bedroom apartment and would love a neighborhood with great walkability.

A few things about me:

* I’m not really into the beach or ocean, so being near the water isn’t a priority.
* I love coffee shops and classical arts (think symphonies, museums, art galleries).
* I’ll probably need a balance of quiet but still having good access to things to do.

If you have any recommendations for neighborhoods that fit this vibe, I’d really appreciate it! ",10,1736021439.0,sanfrancisco,37,0.73,False

1htn5bq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1htn5bq,"SGT James Ward VC, 75 Sqn RNZAF extinguishes an engine fire on a Wellington during raid. July 1941","On the night of 7th July 1941, Sergeant Ward was second pilot of a Wellington bomber returning from an attack on Munster. While flying over the Zuider Zee at 13,000 feet his aircraft was attacked from beneath by a German Bf 110, which secured hits with cannon-shell and incendiary bullets. The rear gunner was wounded in the foot but delivered a burst of fire sending the enemy fighter down, apparently out of control. Fire then broke out in the Wellington's near-starboard engine and, fed by petrol from a split pipe, quickly gained an alarming hold and threatened to spread to the entire wing. The crew forced a hole in the fuselage and made strenuous efforts to reduce the fire with extinguishers, and even coffee from their flasks, without success. They were then warned to be ready to abandon the aircraft. As a last resort Sergeant Ward volunteered to make an attempt to smother the fire with an engine cover which happened to be in use as a cushion. At first he proposed discarding his parachute to reduce wind resistance, but was finally persuaded to take it. A rope from the aircraft dingy was tied to him, though this was of little help and might have become a danger had he been blown off the aircraft.

With the help of his navigator he then climbed through the narrow astrodome and put on his parachute. The bomber was flying at a reduced speed but the wind pressure must have been sufficient to render the operation one of extreme difficulty. Breaking the fabric to make hand and foot holds where necessary and also taking advantage of existing holes in the fabric, Sergeant Ward succeeded in descending three feet to the wing and proceeding another three feet to a position behind the engine, despite the slipstream from the airscrew which nearly blew him off the wing. Lying in this precarious position he smothered the fire in the wing fabric and tried to push the engine cover into the hole in the wing and on the leaking pipe from which the fire came. As soon as he had removed his hand, however, a terrific wind blew the cover out and when he tried again it was lost. Tired as he was, he was able, with the navigator's assistance, to make a successful but perilous journey back into the aircraft. There was now no danger of fire spreading from the petrol pipe as there was no fabric left near it and in due course it burned itself out. When the aircraft was nearly home, some petrol which had collected in the wing blazed up furiously but died down quite suddenly. A safe landing was made despite the damage sustained to the aircraft. The flight home had been made possible by the gallantry of Sergeant Ward in extinguishing the fire on the wing in circumstances of the greatest difficulty and at the risk of his life.
