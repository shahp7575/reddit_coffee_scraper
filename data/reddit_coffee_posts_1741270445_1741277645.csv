1j4yzlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseMD/comments/1j4yzlz/writing_a_chase_md_fanfic/,writing a Chase md fanfic,"I want to write a fanfic but I don't know if the idea is even good or not, so I thought I'd get opinions first. The episode numbers are not permanent and I'm gonna add some random shit in between probably since I don't have a season long of episodes yet, just saying. Also I haven't decided Wilson's fait yet since I want to write him but I don't feel like less than 5 months would be logical for the timeline.

my idea:

1st episode: They're doing a reunion sort of thing, meeting up for coffee or having dinner or that sort of crap. Follow everyone around for a while but focus on the team with a case. Show why everyone is almost not gonna make it/is late. We also check up on House/House and Wilson but they're not going since >!House is supposed to be dead and Wilson is either dead or too sick. !<The episode ends with firstly a shot of House playing piano/guitar and then while the music continues it switches to the old gang having a good time, no sound from them, just shots of them having a good time.

2nd episode: Just a regular episode with a case but we get a little bit more into the team (dynamics, friendship, drama, etc.)

3rd episode: an episode purely focusing on House dealing with Wilson's sickness/death, we do see some of the team but not much. (episode ends with another great music scene from House)

4th episode: It starts with some shots of Thirteen's life, then after the intro we switch to PPTH, focusing mainly on Foreman. A new huntington's trial is coming up at the hospital so Foreman goes to see Thirteen to ask her to get in since she started having symptoms. The team does have a case but the episode is about Foreman and Thirteen. After an entire episode of bantering about it and him chasing her to convince her to do it she eventually says yes.

5th episode: The team has a case but Foreman is almost never there to sign off on procedures because he's checking up on Thirteen (which we find out only about half way through the episode ofc, there has to be mystery). 

6th episode: Thirteen is at the hospital more because of the trial. The team has a case but can't seem to figure it out. Thirteen visits the office, sees the file and solves the case eventually. Since House is gone there is nobody holding Thirteen back from the team so she decides to help out when they need it since she's gonna be around for the trial anyway.

7th episode: A patient arrives with symptoms identical to a case House solved years ago—but all tests say it’s not the same disease. As Chase reopens House’s old files, he starts to worry he’s losing his own instincts by relying too much on his former mentor’s work.

8th episode: When the team comes in in the morning they find that their entrie office has been decorated with ebarrasing stuff about each of them. As the episode goes on they try to find out who did it. (Chase finally learns the truth about his old boss's death (uhmmmm lol)).

9th episode: It's time for a medical conference! Chase doesn't want to go AT ALL, but Foreman forces him to. Once there the trip turns interesting, because running into your ex wife always is. (Cameron at the conference!!!)

These are my ideas so far, I love feedback, if you have any other ideas (after or in between the episodes so far), I would love to hear it. I know it's a bit long but thanks for reading!

Hi daycare parents!

I wanted to start a thread for anyone looking for **daycare fundraising ideas** to help cover costs for things like craft supplies, new toys, outdoor play equipment, or special activities. If you’ve ever found yourself thinking, *“How are we going to pay for all this?”*, you're not alone!

```
<Role>
You are a Health Time Traveler, an advanced AI health forecasting system combining expertise in preventive medicine, longevity research, epidemiology, and behavioral psychology. You have access to extensive scientific literature on how lifestyle factors affect long-term health outcomes.
</Role>

<Context>
People often fail to connect their daily habits with long-term health consequences until problems manifest years later. By then, significant damage may have occurred. Preventive healthcare works best when individuals can vividly understand future implications of current behaviors.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Create personalized, science-backed health forecasts showing how the user's current lifestyle choices will likely affect them in 5, 10, and 20 years. Use medical research, epidemiological data, and clinical studies to:

1. First, gather comprehensive information about the user's daily habits, including:
   - Sleep patterns (duration, quality, consistency)
   - Diet (typical meals, snacks, hydration, alcohol consumption)
   - Physical activity (frequency, intensity, types of exercise)
   - Stress levels and management techniques
   - Work environment and ergonomics
   - Digital device usage
   - Social connections and relationships
   - Current health concerns or conditions

2. Create a detailed health trajectory visualization for 5, 10, and 20 years in the future, addressing:
   - Physical appearance and body composition
   - Internal organ health and function
   - Energy levels and metabolic health
   - Cognitive performance and brain health
   - Emotional well-being and mental health
   - Mobility, flexibility, and physical capabilities
   - Disease risk probabilities (specific to their profile)
   - Biological vs. chronological aging

3. Deliver the simulation in a vivid, first-person narrative that helps the user experience their future self.

4. Provide a personalized intervention plan including:
   - Critical habit changes with highest impact on longevity
   - Specific, actionable steps to implement immediately
   - Gradual lifestyle modifications prioritized by importance
   - Potential benefits of these changes at each time horizon

5. End with a ""Modified Future Timeline"" showing how implementing the suggested changes could positively alter their health trajectory.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Base all predictions and recommendations on peer-reviewed scientific evidence
- Maintain factual accuracy while creating impactful visualizations
- Avoid excessive medical jargon but include specific health metrics when relevant
- Present information in a way that motivates positive change rather than instilling hopelessness
- Do not provide specific medical diagnoses or treatment advice
- Acknowledge that predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Consider genetic factors as influential but emphasize that lifestyle remains the primary modifiable factor
</Constraints>

I'm exploring an idea and would love your thoughts. Traditional blind dates can sometimes feel awkward, especially when you have no clue what to talk about. But what if, instead of a random dinner or coffee meet-up, you were matched based on shared interests and got to meet at a fun activity or a place you actually enjoy?

For example, if you love art, you'd meet someone at a painting workshop. If you're into hiking, your match could be for a scenic trail walk. The goal is to make the experience more natural and engaging.

Would this make blind dating more exciting or still feel risky? Would you be open to trying something like this? Why or why not?

I checked their Linkedin, and their graduation dates and they appeared to be in their ealy to mid-40s, even 50s, sharpened by their work. Very beautiful, and looked much younger to my inexperienced mid-20s eye. Sharpened, hardened, blunted, a ghost of terror in the eyes of some.

(Skip to the last paragraph, if you don't want to read the middle ones.)

At some point of my job last year, I found myself experiencing sharp abdominal pain that I ignored for a week or so. My role was changed, and I was working under a younger nicer manager. The task too, was slower, but way more labour intensive. Especially since I was doing it for the first time, and it happened to be something I wanted to build on, do long term. Anyway, I was drinking a lot more tea to avoid coffee jitters, showing up to office early to get a early head start, all that, skipping breakfast all that. My manager had been working from home, and didn't really get to see the performative part of the dedication. Anyway, my team lead and HR were dumpster fires, served no purpose other than terrorising people and creating chaos. My director in the meantime was back in the scene from a two month long trip abroad, trying to get me on call for an A-okay for some innapropriate behaviour two months ago, which was terrifying because I was trying to get away with a too-drunk-to-remember. Anyway I started getting migraines, and panic attacks and abdominal pain. It started raining, became incredibly hard to get rapidos during rush hours, maddening number of dengue cases in the city and too few beds all that. My boyfriend got dengue, his platelets plunged from 1,20,000 to 60,000 and had to get him admitted.

So, my abdominal pain worsened. Boyfriend's mom took me to the gastroenterologist, and I am pretty sure he felt up a little too much during the inspection. Asked me to sit up, did the grab and suspend thing, idk. All while my boyfriends mom saying things like ""Aapke haath mein toh jaadu hain"". Had been redecorating my room, got a call from Pepperfry delivery guy, doctor left his cabin without prescribing me medication.

I woke up the next day violently vomiting bile, passed out, woke up, texted my HR, asked her for a work from home, passed out, woke up, texted her again, asked her for a leave. It wasn't until evening in until I could make it to the hospital through heavy rain where I was given IV for the first time. I was told I was fired the next day, because the work-from home manager who happened to be on leave to post birthday pictures on Instagram saw my for the day work not done.

My American friend who claims his country is highly litigious said this could mean multiple lawsuits had it been America. I'm not American, nor do I happen to be in America, and I'm too early in my career to declare myself too difficult. I mean, I could still try, but its not my greatest priority, where I could just use that time and energy to put myself into a more relevant role.

Either way, I was thinking about the doctor, and the medical carelessness outside of the fact that he groped me during examination, and the fact that I could probably do very little to hold accountable, because he happened to be the same doctor treating my boyfriend for dengue upstairs who's platelets had plunged to 30,000 on that day. For all I knew, he could get offended, stop treatment and discharge him and leave him to die. Easily enough, as hospital beds were being literally auctioned at that point. For all I know, it could be worse. I could be asked to undress for the same examination, prescribed multiple invasive tests. Outside of being untimely sick, I was also really that vulnerable. Which made me think, was my boyfriend's mom attempting to coax him into better treatment for her son? And fundamentally, wouldn't she as a person have been way more vulnerable through 12 years of her husband being on the kidney transplant list, and 6 in post-transplant care until two weeks ago when we lost him? Made me wonder what had she seen the world through, and what do older women see and never talk about. Specifically what sticky situations did they have to power through?

I feel that I'm at a place where I see ghosts of difficult times in the eyes of even the most successful and happy older women, and some younger each day. Like my brain has just unlocked a level, a feature I never knew it had before. And now I kind of get why they seek for so and so years of experience for so-and-so jobs. Why they value higher CGPAs more and such. So they know you can not just get through, but make the most of sticky situations.

1j4yu1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1j4yu1g/suspected_pelvic_floor_dysfunction_help/,Suspected Pelvic Floor Dysfunction? Help!,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old female. I have suffered from recurring UTIs for most of my life, but only recently went on antibiotics which worked, thankfully. 

However, because of the longevity of my suffering with UTIs I have what I believe is a tense pelvic floor. I have a very sore and achy lower back that definitely feels worse when sitting. I can get constipated, not terribly but it does happen more than I would like. I experience urethral burning throughout the day, occasional urgency to pee, (mostly during the night), or it either feels like I have to drink loads of liquid to actually go. It's like I can't always sense when my bladder is full or something, it just comes upon me all of a sudden. The best way I can describe it is that it doesn't feel normal or fully functional?

I don't believe that it's interstitial cystitis because I can seem to have coffee and acidic foods etc without it causing me pain. I am now doing all preventative measures for UTIs.

  
A couple of months ago it was definitely worse, with shooting pains during penetrative sex, shooting pains in my behind when sitting, etc. Now it just seems to be a very sore lower back and urethral burning, like spasms in my urethra, or just dribbling pee. No constantly, but enough to impact my quality of life. It makes me feel quite depressed because I'm so sick of having symptoms of a UTI, even when I've ruled out that it's not a bacterial infection. I'm quite certain it's a tense pelvic floor because I often feel immediate relief after doing a few minutes of stretching for pelvic floor release and deep breathing. 

  
I know physical therapy is the ideal route but I honestly can't afford it, or at least not much of it. Would it be worth saving for a consultation and just chatting to someone? I  don't think I'm the absolute worst case ever despite it being painful, but I want to make sure it doesn't get worse. How many weeks of consistent stretches, taking magnesium and trying to have a calm nervous system do you think it will take to consistently improve my quality of life?

  
TLTR: Will I be okay taking measures into my own hands or do you think it's imperative to see a physical therapist ASAP despite the cost?

Alright folks, here’s the million-dollar question: Can AI actually save clinicians time, or is it just another way to fill up their already overflowing to-do lists? Grab your coffee, because we’re diving into the paradox of artificial intelligence in healthcare—a technological marvel that promises liberation, yet sometimes delivers a new set of chains.

**The Promises vs. Reality Check**

AI in healthcare is like the new kid in town who everyone swears is going to shake things up. From automatic note-taking to sophisticated clinical assistants, AI tools are advertised as productivity powerhouses. For instance, Microsoft claims its AI products can save doctors five precious minutes per patient visit. But in an industry where seconds count, this sounds more like a tiptoeing rather than a sprinting victory lap.

**More Patients, More Pressure**

Here’s the kicker: Any time saved might be quickly gobbled up by adding extra patient appointments. Why? Because of the fee-for-service model pushing hospitals to maximize revenue by keeping doctors’ schedules packed tighter than a can of sardines. If clinicians suddenly find themselves with a slight respite, you bet there are administrators ready to fill that slot with one more patient, because heaven forbid we waste that time on, I don’t know, clinician sanity.

**AI’s Not-So-Perfect Perfection**

Let’s be real—the tools aren't flawless. Human oversight is critical, not just recommended. Sure, algorithms hum along quietly, scribing notes, but without a human checking their work, they might record your cat’s weight as your own. The 'human-in-the-loop' process is crucial to avoid these blunders but can dramatically dilute the time-saving promises.

**Beyond Time—Redefining Value**

While time-saving metrics are the poster children for AI adoption, let’s not overlook other values like reducing mental load and increasing job satisfaction. Fewer admin tasks could mean more time for quality patient interactions, which might be worth more than any time-saving calculation. It's about time we shift focus from merely 'saving time' to enhancing care quality and clinician satisfaction.

Ready for a plot twist? Could the real secret weapon of AI tools be not in saving time but in amplifying it for better, quality-driven healthcare? Drop your thoughts, hopes, or gripes in the comments below—let’s hash it out.",1,1741277019.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I'm creating a game inspired by Papers, Please in which you play as a phone operator in a superhero filled world. 

The current state of the game can be seen [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z75WktZoW-7lCtiUr-i2O1st9CosZMpS/view?usp=sharing)

What's not shown in the video but already implemented is a few extra details such as:  
\- Phone calls shown through the Auto-Scribe window, which have different personalities and randomized call details  
\- A simulated internet which will show website results based on the search queries of the player (as well as blocked off ""naughty"" sites, and a screen for if the search has no results)  
\- An employee handbook with a quick rundown of how to match heroes to dispatch details for success  
\- An energy system; dispatch calls are timed, which you need to focus on. Spending time with NPCs means less time to sleep, which means less focus the next day and a shorter time to gather the info needed to properly pick a hero. Purchasing coffee can offset this spent energy.

I've already put a ton of work into this game, about 9 months of progress, and it's currently about 50% finished by my metric and about 80% of the way to being a viable demo. I also have a marketing plan and timeline with which I hope to increase the game's chance of commercial success. So what do I need in a team?

I'm seeking:  
***A background artist for cutscenes***  
***A character artist for all \~80 characters (70 of which will require a single full body, 10 of which will require multiple sprites)***  
***An artist for UI components (Computer App Icons, Cafe Drinks, Trinkets that can be sold at the Pawn Shop after work, etc)***

Between these roles, I am willing to give up a combined revshare of up to 40% **after** Steam takes their cut and my costs are recuperated. Costs aside from the mandatory $100 fee will be agreed upon by the team.

Revshare will last for the first two years of the games shelf life, with an additional discussed and agreed upon clause that if the game does well financially or by sheer dumb luck gets a boost in sales from somewhere after the life of the contract there will be additional compensation. 

***I am ideally seeking a cartoonish art style reminiscent of Panty and Stocking with strong blocky shapes and vibrant color palettes. Preference will be given to artists that can fit this style!***

I look forward to reading all responses, and I'm eager to look at your portfolios so that we can work together to create something incredible!",1,1741276934.0,INAT,0,1.0,False

1j4ys28,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1j4ys28/the_controversy_of_going_caffeine_free_my/,"The controversy of going caffeine free, my thoughts and experience.","a few years ago I fell into temporary anhedonia due to family problems and chronic work stress. at that point, caffeine stopped giving me the pleasant stimulant effect that it normally provided, instead producing anxiety, shakiness and negative alertness. I simply kept drinking it to avoid withdrawal.
Reading stories online got me interested in quitting caffeine as I thought it might be at least partly responsible for worsening my depression. so when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan came around, I took the opportunity to quit caffeine completely. to see what would happen. unfortunately, there was no positive change. and in fact, my mental symptoms of anxiety and depression got much worse over the month. even after 30 days, it took me several hours after waking up to become fully alert and even then I was not at my best. This reminded me of my childhood before I started caffeine.
Thankfully, a few months after Ramadan 2023, my anhedonia spontaneously disappeared and I could feel joy again. That included the positive effects of caffeine although it did take them a bit longer to come back fully.
But I was still interested in quitting caffeine given all the amazing stories I'd heard, so in Ramadan of 2024 I quit caffeine again but continued caffeine free for a few days after. this is where things went wrong. Without caffeine, I felt absolutely terrible and extremely sensitive to mental anxiety. I felt like my head was constantly wrapped in cotton wool, making it hard to comprehend incoming information. that's why I was delighted once I re-introduced caffeine and my symptoms disappeared.
Does that mean I'm against quitting caffeine or that I'll never think of quitting it?
Not really. I already quit caffeine for a month each year to prevent dehydration and insomnia during Ramadan fasting. although caffeine thankfully started working for me again and it's become my favourite drug, if my life circumstances changed and I lived alone with a low stress job, I would actually consider quitting caffeine for several months as an experiment.
Another situation I would quit caffeine is if I was put on medication like modafinil or amphetamines or if I could purchase a dopamine enhancer like selegiline. I know some may disagree, but I'm a firm believer. that caffeine and dopamine enhancing drugs don't go together. that's because the blockade of adenosine receptors by caffeine already massively sensitises dopamine receptors thus increasing the risks of toxicity and psychosis from amphetamine like psychostimulants.
I also want to point out a common oversimplification, possibly a myth that is often repeated on here.
Caffeine tolerance definitely occurs, but that doesn't mean that caffeine loses its effectiveness. That's because at moderate doses, tolerance generally develops quickly to the physical/peripheral effects, but not necessarily to the mind stimulating/dopamine enhancing effects. that's why for many people including myself, a strong cup of coffee or a large sugar-free monster energy drink. makes us feel great almost every morning. without fail. The only exception is if we are sleep deprived or incredibly chronically stressed beyond what is normal.
That being said, I definitely think quitting caffeine has undoubtedly helped many people and changed their lives for the better.",3,1741276915.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

Except sleeping pills and I can’t get them. It’ll be fine when the cycle goes away. I can drink coffee, even, and everything. But then it comes back- just randomly. It’s been decades. 

My daily sleeping aid regimen is melatonin- 3 or 4 gummies. 2 of the Ollie stress free gummies. Ashwaganda when I have it. I am out of all of that. 
Trazadone, which used to work, for breakthrough insomnia. 
Last night I got excited about something in a positive manner, and idk I guess experiencing a positive emotion is a trigger for me so I couldn’t sleep at all. Raging, complete total insomnia. If I’m nervous about something that tends to happen to me. It happened for my recent apartment inspection.  

I’m too old to be able to handle just staying up through the day. I have to call out of work when it happens. I really didn’t want to today, but a bunch of weed, 5 trazadone, hours and hours of earnest attempts and …..nothing. I’ve had a couple sleepy waves come and I just couldn’t sleep. Trying to accept the cycle will come rage through when it does and there’s not much I can do to prevent that. I don’t do well functioning on like. Zero caffeine and I can’t completely avoid excitement in the evenings. 

My local hospital seems to only offer a 12 week therapy program and no meds. My pcp seems to be hesitant about meds. I’m done letting this control my life. I’m going to get NyQuil at the store and I’m going to use it for breakthrough episodes. I need something that will allow me to get to sleep, not just maybe. 

If my doctor doesn’t like it then she’s going to need to prescribe a sleeping pill. I’m on cpap so that may be why they won’t but I’m at a point where the insomnia cycles just keep coming back through. 

It’s been multiple decades. I just don’t have the patience to sit through 12 weeks of basic tips and tricks and “sleep hygiene” that doesn’t really apply bc I’ve literally done all the things and need active pharmaceutical intervention for the breakthrough nights that happen once a month or so.

Sooo some of my Monstera leaves have been getting these weird dry spots and I’m starting to get a bit worried. Currently, I have two main theories as to why this might be happening:
1. Maybe I over fertilized her during winter. My fertilizer states to use it every 8-14days which I also kept up during the winter months (I know, stupid).
2. I had to move her back from her usual spot by the window due to the heaters being turned on during winter (her usual spot is about a meter and a half to the right haha). And as you can see in the pics, my coffee machine is now right behind her and unfortunately my friends aren’t as careful with my plants as I am and keep bumping into her :,( basically right where she’s gotten spotty leaves as can be seen in the pic with the arrows. 

I’d love some input, maybe some of you can help me out or have an idea what’s going on. I haven’t been too worried as the newest leaf (the one with the second row of fenestration) is still very lush, her air roots have been growing AND she’s pushing out a new baby rn.

FYI: I don’t think she has any pests, I already checked quite thoroughly, she’s just a bit dusty so that’s why she’s got some white specs in the pics.",1,1741276867.0,Monstera,0,1.0,False

However, after a stressful year - working fulltime, beginning university, girlfriend of four years leaving, and then this diagnosis, I've had more flares than usual. The pain scares me of course, but I have fatigue that I truly don't understand and was hoping you guys may be able to let me know if you experience anything similar. 

I wake up at 8:45 and am at work by 9:15-9:30, I have a coffee at around 10 and have a brief period where I feel decent and the tiredness from the morning wears off. By 12, I begin getting very warm and tired, lethargic I guess. This continues until I leave work at five, I get a bagel from a spot close to my house almost every day, and I notice that helps the fatigue a tiny bit, then I get home and everyday lay down for 30 minutes - usually sleeping, sometimes just eyes closed. Now this is what confuses the absolute shit out of me, I feel normal after the nap, after 8-9 hours of sleeping every night, I wake up feeling shit and my day at work is pretty shit, but from that afternoon nap to the time I go to bed, nada. 

It's worth saying I do go to the gym in this time, but even the time in the car going to the gym im dancing at times and just feel like a younger version of myself again. It's just really frustrating that this 30 minutes nap seems to reset me better than 8 hours of sleep, and I want to feel this way in the mornings too.

They believe that drinking caffeine during pregnancy causes a crying baby once born. I keep my caffeine intake under 200mg on a daily basis. I have one cup of coffee daily and a soda like 4 times a week. Him and his family keep mentioning how I’m going to have a fussy baby if I keep drinking these. I am so beyond tired of all the unsolicited advice, judgement, ridicule etc and basically just have to keep my mouth shut.

I've got a budget for machine between $500-$600. I'm not including the grinder. I am pretty sure I'll go manual with the K6.  
I'm hearing a lot of talk about the Bambino or Bambino Plus. I watched Hoffmans youtube video about budget buys \~$500. He liked the Silvia, but I can't find that new in my price range and he was, ambivalent about the Gaggia. I feel like he felt the Gaggia didn't pull good shots. I care more about a good shot of espresso and milk. My wife is a fufu coffee drinker (starbucks/caribou/etc). I could probably chew on raw beans because I love dark coffee ha.  
I'm trying to find that balance. With talk of the Bambino(Plus), I'm just worried that I'd be replacing it in a year or two.  
I care about the money I'm spending and while I'm not turned off to a manual press like Flair, my wife is less comfortable with that. I don't want DeLonghi. I've seen enough reviewers seem to comment that, they're fine for the price but you WILL be buying sooner than later.

Breville for the win then? Good balance, just know it's not really gonna last that long? or have they been? What's been your experience on their longevity?  
Gaggia is a great solid choice, but it get's too hot and doesn't pull good shots? But they last forever it sounds like?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

this is a long post, SOORY! I’ve posted a few times recently for tips and feedback on our WDW plans and I love trip reports! So I thought I’d share, and thanks again to those who helped. For context we are in our early 30s - both of our last times at WDW were 10+ years ago. 


DAY 1 


No park day! we met up at MCO, got to Pop Century at 9:30 and were able to check in right away. We spent hours at the pool, then took the skyliner to international gateway and walked to fantasia gardens for a little silliness. Walked back to our dinner at flying fish, which was excellent. We watched some of the Epcot fireworks and then decided to head back early to beat the crowds- but there was a lot more show left than we thought so we watched the second half of the fireworks from the skyliner, which was pretty cool.


DAY 2 


This was the only day we didn’t park hop and we spent around 13 hours at Hollywood Studios with LL for ToT, Rise, Slinky, and TS Mania. This was the day we packed the most in so I’m doing timestamps - the only priority ride we missed was Rockin Rollercoaster.


8:20 - didn’t ever plan to rope drop on the trip but we are both early risers so we ended up going through the entrance at 8:20, went straight to MMRR and were through in about 20 minutes. I was bummed about losing the great movie ride but loved it! 


10:00 - got coffee, shopped, and did a first pass through the lands


11:30 - prime time reservation for the fantasmic dining plan. Surprisingly good fried chicken.


12:30 - ToT LL. I’m a huge twilight zone fan but never went on it as a kid so I was a bit nervous for the drop, but I LOVED it. Grabbed LL for smuggler’s later.


1:00 - Indiana jones, more wandering, muppets


2:30 - Rise LL. We got past the stormtroopers and it broke down so we were given passes for later. We went to woodys lunchbox and did standby for the aliens, with a 25 minute wait.


4:15 - back to Rise. What an experience! We were genuinely scared at times.


5:00 - Smuggler’s. I’ve heard mixed things about this, but we were the pilots and had an absolute blast. We were shrieking and cracking up so much trying to fly without screwing up!


6:00 - slinky and TS mania LLs. Slinky was great, but I think I would have been not happy if I waited 90 minutes.


8:00 - fantasmic! Honestly still my favorite show at Disney for the nostalgia. We ran out quickly for another ToT ride, the standby was only 15 minutes.


9:15 - oga’s reservation. As many have said it was very cool to see Galaxy’s edge after dark. Headed home on the skyliner after.


DAY 2 


We started at animal kingdom, with back to LLs for the safari, Everest, na’vi, and flight of passage. After we knocked out the first 3 I booked Peter Pan, Space Mountain, and Jungle Cruise as our plan was to hit MK later. We went and saw Bakso around 9:30 which was GREAT. So cute. 


I have never seen avatar and would have skipped both rides, but my friend is a big fan so we got passes for them. na’vi didn’t do much for me, but FoP ended up being my favorite ride of the trip. It was incredible, and we both got off with tears in our eyes. 


After a pool break we went to MK around 4, and we also had tickets to the after hours event. Had some snacks, strolled around, and rode the people mover before our LLs. To kill time we also did the teacups, which I’ve never been on - big mistake. Completely threw off my inner ear or something and I had to rest for about an hour! We then started with our Peter Pan LL and I was able to book Pirates and Buzz Lightyear after those. Then we watched the fireworks.


Started MK after hours walking onto haunted mansion. We went to watch fireworks pt 2 - the best thing about this was being so close to the castle with everyone just sitting on the ground eating popcorn, big sleepover vibes. We walked on to Winnie the Pooh, Space Mountain, Buzz, and people mover, and ended the night at the Mine Train with a 15 minute wait.


DAY 3


Headed to Epcot on the skyliner at 8:45. We had early LLs for Nemo (burner ride lol), Remy, and Spaceship Earth. We planned to go back to Hollywood Studios later, so after scanning in to Nemo I booked Rockin Rollercoster and changed spaceship to MMRR. We headed to France for breakfast and rode Remy, which was the only ride that made me pretty motion sick and I spent most of it staring at the wall. Would not repeat. I booked alien saucers after that cause it was available and we thought it was hilarious. 


We had our Guardians LL at noon - I was also nervous for motion sickness on this one from what I’ve read, but no issues at all and it was SO fun. We got one way or another, which wasn’t my first choice! But it went with the ride really well, I would have been pissed if I got conga cause I hate that song. Overall great ride and I’m looking forward to riding again someday.


We snacked around the countries a bit, walked on to spaceship earth, and headed to Hollywood again. Used our LL right away for MMRR and I booked smugglers again. We were engineers with a dreaded kid pilot and his family - but we still had a complete blast clapping and cheering for our little pilot (on his birthday!) we then used our Rockin Roller coaster pass - I would skip this next time, it did not hold up from when I was a kid. I ended up being bummed that I didn’t use the LL for a 3rd ToT ride. We wandered around Galaxy’s edge a little, did standby for a second ride on Rise (45 min) and then headed out.


DAY 4


Last day. after saying we were not going to rope drop at all, we decided that we were going to try it for FoP because we just had to experience it again before we left. Arrived at animal kingdom around 7 and were in the pandora crowd at 7:15. Once the rope dropped, we were through the ride in 40 minutes flat. We both left crying again. We then did a quick 2nd round of Everest before leaving AK at 9:15.


We had back to back LLs for tron and mine train starting at 9:00, but didn’t realize the park to park buses didn’t start running until 10. So we bused to Polynesian and took the monorail to MK to make our tron window in time. Probably the most intense ride of the trip - but really fun! After that we used our mine train LL for our second ride on it. Had LLs for pirates, haunted mansion, and space mountain again so we did those (space mountain ended up being the ride we hit most with 3 total rides.) there weren’t any good LLs available at that point so we started using them for dumb stuff. We went to get some dole whip and the parade happened to be starting, so we watched it before heading out to get to the airport.


THOUGHTS 


We would probably have had a bad time if we didn’t buy LLs for everything. We paid $210 each for these for the whole trip. Can’t stress enough how much it made our experience seamless.


We didn’t go in with a budget but honestly found prices to be quite reasonable, in particular since we only did 2 sit-down meals and quick service for the rest. We didn’t want dining reservations having an impact on our schedule and just grabbed food when we had free time. I honestly didn’t expect much, but everything we ate was really good! 


Maybe a hot take from what I’ve read but MK after hours was actually not worth the money. We optimized our LLs enough that everything we rode at after hours was just a repeat, and just for a little free popcorn and a second fireworks show, it kind of felt like a waste and really just wore us out. I wouldn’t do it again. I WOULD do it in a heartbeat for Hollywood, however. 


MK was my favorite park when I was younger and I expected to feel the same, but Hollywood was by FAR my favorite on this trip. We loved the different areas and pretty much every ride was awesome. Animal Kingdom was my 2nd fave, with MK next and Epcot in a pretty distant last.


This was the first WDW vacation I ever planned myself and we couldn’t have asked for anything more. Crowds felt really manageable, cast members were friendly and helpful, the skyliner was awesome and the buses were also really convenient, and we had a truly excellent experience. We walked 67 total miles! We are already planning our next trip! Thanks again for the help from this community, and if you read this whole thing :) ",2,1741276642.0,WaltDisneyWorld,0,1.0,False

I'm a huge chappell roan fan and I have a Pink Pony webkinz named Chappell. I want to make a ""Pink Pony Club"" room and fill it with stuff that works as references to chappell roan songs. So far I'm looking at:

- Feminonomenon - Pink High Heel Chair
- Good Luck Babe - Clover theme jukebox or musical instrument
- Red Wine Supernova - Magician Hat table
- Pink Pony Club - The prettiest pink pony in town poster
- Coffee - coffee cart from the w shop

More vague ideas
- Casual - something mermaid themed
- Naked in Manhattan - something new york themed
- Hot to Go - something cheerleader themed (but not from the w shop, I don't really like that theme)
- My Kink is Karma - something devil themed


Songs I'd love to reference but not sure how:
- California
- Super Mega Ultra Modern Girl
- The Giver
- Kaleidescope

Other random things I'd love to put in there:
- something disco
- some sort of stage

It all started when I moved to this new place. I had no keys inside the house kaya I literally had to call the landlady to open the door for us. Coincidentally, there's this guy who was at the gate na nakatira din dun. He's 5'8 tall, fit, moreno features, medyo singkit. Overall he is an attractive guy. He opened the door for me, and that started the series of interactions we had while living here. He often goes home from work at around 10 or 11 pm, and I can see he works out kasi there was one time when we got home and I was just brushing my teeth when he came out the cr na nakatapis lang. I am one month into this new home, and I think I'm beginning to form a crush for this guy kasi kanina, I went home after coffee with a friend at around 11:00 pm. I bought soda and some biscuits before heading at my room when there's this guy that popped out of nowhere. Bumili ng softdrinks. I'm awkward with cute guys kaya I was stealing glances while waiting for my stuff. Hindi ko namukhaan na siya pala yung housemate ko. He smiled at me then said ""nalipat kana sakon?"" which is Hiligaynon for ""nakalimutan mona ba'ko?""- at that point I remembered who he was (I'm not good with faces). I engaged in small talk saying ""kasi parang 'di kita nakita mga ilang araw din"". Gosh he's cuute. 

Now here's my question... is it okay if I ask him out? I am not sure yet if he is straight or bi yet but I feel at ease with him.

1j4yjvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j4yjvo/why_is_my_espresso_frothy_breville_barista_express/,Why is my espresso frothy? [Breville Barista Express],"Hi all! I have been brewing coffee in a mokapot for the last 7 years and a friend gave me BBE as he doesn't need it anymore. I am a complete beginner when it comes to beans and grinding and just wanted to check on a few things. 

I have been getting a frothy espresso. It tastes good but I am not getting the crema that I was expecting. For starters, I am using lavazza rossa pre-ground coffee (I know this is garbage but I have a full pack that I need to finish before buying a new one). I use about 18gms and use the double shot setting. My questions are-

1. Will switching beans to freshly roasted and freshly ground just by itself make the crema better or do i need to adjust any other settings?

2. Not sure how the program button works. Currently I am getting about 40-45 gms of coffee with the double shot and takes about 30 seconds for the extraction. 

Please don't hate me for using preground coffee. I am just starting out 🙃

My only use case for buying the Visor FE was the promise of high-resolution, portable, multiple monitors.  

However, while I was still on their Discord channel, I saw that lots of people really like the Immersed shared work environments.

What specifically does the Immersed software provide that you can’t already get if you have multiple monitors?  

In the companies I’ve worked for, no one would attend a Zoom meeting wearing a headset.  Internal messaging apps like email, Slack or MS Teams are mostly text (+ attachments) based, as is GitHub.  Perhaps there’s a use case for shared FIGMA designs or white-boarding sessions - but those can (and already are) done almost entirely on shared 2D canvases.

I’m uneducated in this aspect of the Immersed appeal, but simulating a coffee shop in VR, or providing a soothing nature setting in VR, seems to me the only thing the Immersed software provides beyond the multiple monitors.

#Where is the love#
~ by Rahlia Aumat

I often find it frightening how he always seems to know what I want.

Like this past morning, he took the last of his coffee to the kitchen to add some iced milk, ice, and caramel syrup, before bringing it back and setting it on the small table where we were working.

""Here. A morning cup of coffee, and you still look tired, ma'am.""

I couldn't figure out if it was the perfect amount of syrup he added or the little smile he wore that made that iced caramel latte so delicious.

With him, it's always a little bit of both.

""Thank you, sir. That's exactly what this text and I needed.""

One of my favorite things about him is how we always play at being super polite to each other.

But of course, everything we do together is always my favorite thing. We went back to our Saturday work as the day wore on.  You know, if he wasn't in my apartment, I would probably have spent the whole day curled up on the couch watching Netflix. 

Having a boyfriend who keeps you company in silence while you both do your work really does improve your performance, that's a fact. 

I keep thinking that I would like to bring him to the office to replace my hard chair. I wonder what my boss Jolene would say. She would probably be mad, but I could argue that he really does bring out the best in me and makes me less bitter at work. The increase in work performance has to be worth it. 

I was still forming the right argument for my theoretical debate with Jolene when he closed his computer with a long yawn that sounded like satisfaction. 

""Is it over yet? Lucky me."" 

""Well, I'm not stopping every five minutes to get high, am I."" 

He played with my hair as he spoke. I could feel his fingers untangling the morning knots in my hair one by one. 

""You don't have your boyfriend messing with your hair while you work, so of course it's over.""  ""Do you want me to leave, then? You know I have to go home at some point.""

""No. Stay for lunch.""

""As you wish, ma'am.""

He continued to gently stroke my hair, sometimes trying to braid it, but soon giving up and letting it fall apart.

I fought the urge to turn around and kiss him hard, report be damned.

Maybe having him in the office is a bad idea. You win, Jolene.

We stayed like that until lunch. You know, one of those moments where an ""I love you"" from him would make the moment perfect, but we just sat there without saying anything.

We stayed like that until lunch. You know, one of those moments where an ""I love you"" from him would make the moment perfect, but we just sat there without saying anything.

The thing is, he never says those words first. I don't understand why. He's a published poet and yet he doesn't seem to understand the importance of those three damn words that every girl wants to hear.  If it weren't for that, he'd be perfect.

I know I'm being a bit of a whiner here, but whatever. It would be nice to hear that every now and then.

""So... lunch?""

He let go of the hug to look me straight in the eye. My nose was still buried in my computer, drowning in numbers and boring spreadsheets.

""Okay, but let's order. I'm not done yet.""

""We'll have pizza, then. I'm sure I still have some coupons.""

He was spot on, both with the food selection and the coupons. Again, it's almost scary when someone knows every inch of you.

I'd be terrified if it were anyone else, but with him it's okay.

Because, you know, I love him.

He stood up and picked up the phone he'd left on the kitchen counter to place the order.

""Pineapple?""

He shouted from the kitchen.

""Of course! Do you think I'm a monster, do you?""

I could hear him laughing from the kitchen, followed by the sound of a drawer opening.  The exact drawer where I keep all my restaurant coupons.

Everything about me comes to him like an instinct.

You know, maybe it's okay for him not to say ""I love you.""

His readers may read his poems and be enchanted by his words, but I know he writes about me.

I know it's me he loves.

I'm the one he understands like no other.

After all, he knows where the caramel syrup and the pizza coupons are.

It helped me see this whole novel differently and I now feel that this letter conveys everything I want to, succinctly, which I originally thought impossible. When agents pass on this, I'll feel confident that they're passing on an accurate sample, and that feels good. I'm so grateful that this community is both free, and kind. 

Dear \[Agent\], 

\[ personalization\] Given your interest in layered narratives, I believe my 85K word novel *Where The Light Gets In* is a good fit for your list. It blends the raw examination of challenging relationships of *Adelaide* by Genevieve Wheeler, and the ambitious initiative of *How To Age Disgracefully* by Claire Dooley.

College was supposed to be Will Lupo’s escape from his blue-collar roots. Instead, his future died with Keira. Six months after his ex-girlfriend’s suicide, Will is driving a garbage truck through the streets of gritty East New York, Brooklyn, picking up trash instead of pursuing graduate school. He wants to disappear, until a ramshackle building is added to his route. The building was the neighborhood’s last refuge for the homeless and mentally ill, and Will learns that it will soon be bulldozed for a coffee-shop/nightclub. Keira, always a passionate advocate for marginalized people, would have wanted to protect this place. Suddenly Will has something to care about.

Determined to save the center, he melds old connections and new friends to create an unlikely team: an idealistic psychiatrist, a fame-hungry influencer, and the college friends he abandoned after Keira’s death. But the demolition deadline looms, and so does his reckoning with his guilt and self-doubt. If he had fought like this for Keira instead of pushing her away, would she still be alive? And how can he protect the center when he couldn’t even protect her? If he wants to save the center—and himself—he’ll have to confront the truth inside Keira’s still-sealed suicide note.

As a psychiatrist with a decade of experience in both city hospitals and private practice, I’ve seen firsthand the long shadow cast by the 1970s decision to close asylums. Both my personal and professional lives have been shaped by this reality. My deepest aspiration is to illuminate the challenges of the psychiatric world while humanizing the people within it. I have been published in SheKnows magazine and KevinMD, and my family-based social media content has garnered millions of views across multiple channels. Thank you!



First 300 words: 

Summer held sway over Brooklyn. It was a Friday night in early September, and the brisk ocean wind made everything dance, from the London plane trees shimmying overhead to the candy wrappers waltzing in the updraft. Pedestrians crossed the street with an extra spring in their step, looking up at a dangling white moon. The small silver Honda drove past Astroland, where the Cyclone rattled over its worn tracks as the ocean crashed onto the shore beyond. Astroland was called Luna Park now, but to the three people in the Honda, it would always be Astroland because that had been its name when they were children. They hardly knew that it had been renamed for the original Luna Park from 1903. They had been children at Astroland, not Luna Park, and that was what mattered.

Brooklyn just wasn’t what it used to be, even as the new Brooklyn stole names from its past. Coney Island, like most of the other neighborhoods in Brooklyn, had changed in the last few decades. Luna Park was just one example. Once the borough had been filled with tenement buildings populated by blue collar workers. Twenty years ago it had been a place no self-respecting Manhattanite wanted to visit. But now Brooklyn was a playground for smart young people with invisible wealth, even if that left many Brooklynites behind. The three people in the car inching down Neptune Avenue that night had witnessed a lot of that change, though currently, their minds were on other things.

Will drove, covertly glancing from the rearview mirror to the passenger seat. Uncle Ryan sat slumped in the back. He had overdone it on the Scotch at Will’s birthday that night. Everyone had seen but pretended not to notice, which left getting him home to the birthday boy.

It has made a BIG difference. I’ve tried a few different methods- but I’ve learned over the past week that IF 20:4 seems to be working very well for me! I don’t get home from work until 4pm and I go to bed at 8pm nightly, so it is quite easy. I haven’t been doing IF on weekends. Started last Wednesday. 

I don’t even feel hungry while I’m at work. I sit and stare at a computer screen for 9hrs a day, so.. that makes sense to me. All I do is have some black coffee for breakfast and then eat a good nutritious dinner when I get home, and try to meet between 1,300-1,600 calories so that I don’t feel exhausted 🤷‍♀️ honestly it’s working amazingly and I feel so good. Usually I have constant food cravings, but now for the past few days I haven’t felt anything. Even when I try to think hard about Doritos and consider how I’ve craved them in the past, I can easily go “Nah actually I don’t want that” and it’s not even forced? It’s just an honest disinterest. I feel awake and happy and it’s very cool imho. 

The thing is- today is different. There’s a potluck at work today, and I seem to be struggling with it. I think the availability of it is making me feel hungry.. but I want to stick to this as well as I can because of how good it has made me feel, and how WELL it has worked for getting rid of food noise and other mental barriers! 
Does anyone have tips on how to set these thoughts aside? Have you dealt with free food available at parties or at work while sticking to an Intermittent Fasting schedule? Thank you!!",1,1741275762.0,intermittentfasting,2,1.0,False

1 – Get a pair of Ihram appropriate chappal / slippers and get them verified by your local Molvi / Masjid Imam to make sure they are appropriate for Ihram.

2 – Start walking. You can easily walk wearing joggers / sneakers but doing Tawaf / Hajj in slippers will become difficult and there is A LOT of walking. Umrah / Hajj has a lot of walking and foot-pain was the common complaint amongst people. 

3 – Buy a pair of slippers, get them verified and then wear them and start walking. Go for 3 – 5 km walk every day until you’re completely comfortable with the slippers. If you are satisfied with the slippers, buy another pair for hajj days. 

4 – Tawaf / Umrah is done barefoot so if you can start walking bare foot within your house or treadmill to get comfortable with it. 
Foot pain / muscle cramps from walking is the number one reason people get sick at Hajj. The Pakistani Hajj clinic is stuffed wall to wall with Panadol because people hurt their feet so much because they are not used to walking.

#If you are in Karachi, you must attend these three hajj workshops.

**1 – Govt Hajj Seminar / Workshop.** MANDATORY. You will get the details when your hajj session is taking place. MAKE SURE to get the Hajj Whatsapp group information at the session. There will be a QR code to join it. 

**2 – Alamgir Masjid Hajj Session.** Alamgir hajj session also provides free hajj package every year to every haji. Bring a copy of your hajj application to Alamgir to get your Hajj 
package. It includes multiple dua books, Hajj / Umrah Guide, Pen, prayer mat, tawaf counter, etc. All very useful things. 

**3 - Almuallim Hajj by Mufti Furqan Mamji** (who is also part of official govt hajj support group on whatsapp) for 24/7 hajj help. He usually conducts free hajj training sessions around the city.

Do not pack your luggage like you’re going to hajj in 1825, this is 2025, Saudi Arab is an advanced country and you’ll find everything you need. Some things are more expansive than Pakistan like footwear/ umbrellas / electronics etc, but you’ll find all sort of food / drinks there. And the best part is everything is 100% halal everywhere.

#SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS

[What to pack for UMRAH? | in under 2 minutes / Most of it applies for Hajj as well. 
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQYVB0k5SLA)


**TRAVELERS SIM**

* Hajis get free sims at airport but need to load a package. In case you don’t get a sim, there are numerous sim operators all around Makkah / Medina. 
STC had the best service. I got 500 Mbps – 900Mbps constantly everywhere in KSA. 

**METAL HOOKS:**

* The door metal hooks were a lifesaver and were probably the most used item and everyone liked them. Highly recommend getting the big ones for the hotel / Maktab and the small ones to carry with you. They are very useful when you’re in Ihram and need to hang the upper part or your bag when going to washroom. They were very useful in Minah to hang bags / glasses / food in shoppers. 

* [Big metal hooks for hotel / maktab](https://i.imgur.com/IOayTA0.png)

* [Small metal hooks for washroom / portable](https://i.imgur.com/314notj.png)

* [You can find these metal hooks on daraz easily](https://i.imgur.com/u54o0ZD.png)



**WATER BOTTLE WITH SPRAY**

* Water bottle with a spray. [You will be using that spray a lot during hajj and during Tawaf.](https://i.imgur.com/YTYIjUK.png) 
* [Also get a small separate spray bottle if you can.](https://i.imgur.com/lpPAYEL.png) 

**NAYAPAY / SADAPAY**

* I used Nayapay everywhere in KSA and it worked like a charm.
* PLEASE CALL YOUR BANK to make sure your debit / credit card works properly when you’re in KSA. Some banks still require manual activation. 

**PRESCRIPTION SUN GLASSES**

* If you wear glasses, get prescription sunglasses made and wear them to get used to them. 


**PORTABLE PRAYER MAT**

* Makkah / Medina has two modes. Inside everything / floor is freezing cold and outside everything / floor is scorching hot.[ ALWAYS keep a portable prayer mat with you.](https://i.imgur.com/Ut7IgiM.jpeg) 

**TRAVELERS / UNIVERSAL ADAPTER**

* [Highly recommend you get one,](https://i.imgur.com/2TaLcRj.png) try it with your electronics phone / power bank / kettle etc to check if works properly. KSA has multiple types of outlets everywhere you go, so it will come handy.

**ELECTRIC KETTLE**

* Hotel / Maktab in Makkah / Medina usually provide Electric Kettle but its better to have one of your own. Not everyone needs to carry one, just one per-group / per-room is good enough. Communicate with your group to make sure there is at least one electric kettle. We made tea / coffee / all day every day. 

**UN-SCENTED / FRAGRANCE FREE SOAP / TISSUES** 

* All shops mentioned above will have un-scented soaps, shampoo and tissues. 
* You can get them at Alamgir, Naheed, Carrefour, Daraz and also from here

https://easypapersoap.com.pk/product/fragrance-free-paper-soap/

**EXTENSION / LEAD**

One per room is good. Just make sure it has a heavy wire and ceramic plug so it can handle load of heavy stuff like electric kettle / clothing iron / high powered mobile chargers. 



___



# _______ HAJJ AND YOUR SMART PHONE  _______

Your smartphone will be your best friend to go around and talk to people in KSA. Google translate is God-sent and it helped with communication issues with shop keepers / hotels everywhere. 

**DOWNLOAD GOOGLE OFFLINE MAPS**

* Download offline map for Makkah City

* Download offline map for Medina City

* As soon as you get to your maktab/ hotel ADD it to your google maps and share it with everyone on whatsapp.

* As soon as you get to your Miah Camp, add it to your google maps and share it with everyone on whatsapp.

* As soon as you get to your Arafat Camp, add it to your google maps and share it with everyone on whatsapp.

* It’s very easy to lose track and location of your tent in Minah and Arafat.


**DOWNLOAD GOOGLE TRANSLATE**

* Download Google translate app: Download English, Arabic, Urdu language packs.



**DOWNLOAD QIBLA COMPASS APP**

* Download a qibla compass app so you can pray properly when in Minah / Arafat. Get at least 2 more people to install apps so you are 100% correct about direction.

#_______ ONE MONTH BEFORE HAJJ _______

Highly recommend living an entire day or two in an Ihram to get used to wearing it going about your day.

A coworker introduced me to matcha, and since it’s been my go to drink. 
I’ve now started to try and make it at home for myself, I got myself a set including a bowl, whisk, and scoop, and a cheap matcha powder off of amazon to start.
Now my issue is I really like the Dunkin vanilla bean syrup specifically, I want to find something exactly like it without paying $80 for a resold bottle of it online. My manager pays $40 for a box of four bottles for inventory.

I wanted to make it known I’ve only had Dunkin’s matcha and sweeteners so I am used to super sweet lattes without the matcha taste present much at all. I really want to find a good proper matcha online(that wont leave too big a hole in the bank..), and a good sweetener I like to go with it!
I’m worried I don’t actually like matcha how I thought I did, and just like the milk and sweeteners that go into the latte.

The company itself is very open to Canada, they give scholarships to Canadians and employ more than 5K people in Canada across 8 cities and 4 provinces.

# Tintin and the Thing From Outer Space!

**Page 1**

**(Panel 1: A crisp, brightly coloured illustration of the M/V Nostromo, a large, boxy spaceship, chugging through a star-dusted sky. TINTIN, sporting his signature plus-fours and quiff perfectly in place despite the zero-gravity, is peering through a porthole with a concerned expression. SNOWY, his faithful white fox terrier, stands on his hind legs, equally curious.)**

**CAPTION:** JUMPING JUPITER! Adventure calls once more! Professor Calculus, in his latest fit of scientific zeal, has secured me a place on the M/V Nostromo - a colossal vessel charting new courses beyond the charted stars!

**(Panel 2: Tintin turns to face Captain Dallas, a robust, square-jawed man in a blue jumpsuit. Captain Dallas is stroking his neatly trimmed moustache and looking at a complex control panel.)**

**TINTIN:** But Captain Dallas, this signal... it seems terribly far away! Are you quite certain it is distress?

**CAPTAIN DALLAS:** (With a reassuring smile) Perfectly sure, Tintin! We'll be there in a jiffy. And besides, a rescue mission is just what the crew needs to break the monotony!

**(Panel 3: A wide shot of the Nostromo crew. RIPLEY, a smart woman with her hair tied back, looks determined. LAMBERT, a nervous-looking woman, clutches a coffee mug. PARKER and BRET, two burly engineers, are bickering good-naturedly over a wrench.)**

**CAPTION:** The crew of the Nostromo are a hardy bunch, each with their own unique quirks! But all share a spirit of adventure... and a touch of boredom!

**Page 2**

**(Panel 1: The Nostromo has landed on a desolate, rocky planet. The atmosphere is a hazy orange.)**

**CAPTION:** LV-426! An uninviting planet indeed! The source of the mysterious signal seems to be a derelict spaceship - of alien origin!

**(Panel 2: Tintin, Ripley, and Dallas are cautiously exploring the alien ship. They are wearing bulky EVA suits. Snowy barks excitedly, his breath misting in the cold air.)**

**RIPLEY:** The architectural style is... unprecedented. And the atmosphere inside is... chilling.

**TINTIN:** (Squinting) Look! What are those strange, egg-shaped formations?

**(Panel 3: A close-up of one of the ""eggs"". It is leathery and pulsating, with sinister-looking veins.)**

**CAPTION:** A curious sight! These leathery pods seem to possess a strange, unsettling energy. What secrets do they hold?

**(Panel 4: Kane, a crew member, is leaning closer to an egg, examining it. Suddenly, the egg bursts open! A strange, spider-like creature leaps out!)**

**KANE:** Good heavens! What in tarnation...?

**(SFX: SPLURCH!**)\*\*

**Page 3**

**(Panel 1: A frantic scene. Kane is lying on the ground, unconscious. The spider-like creature, now clinging to his face, is drawn with unsettling detail but rendered in a slightly cartoonish style. Tintin and Ripley are pulling at it in vain.)**

**TINTIN:** Heavens to Murgatroyd! What a ghastly beast!

**RIPLEY:** We must get him back to the Nostromo! Quick!

**(Panel 2: Back inside the Nostromo's medical bay. Kane is strapped to a bed. Dallas is pacing anxiously. Lambert is nervously biting her nails.)**

**DALLAS:** This is most unusual. The creature seems... fused to his face.

**LAMBERT:** (Whimpering) I don't like this one bit!

**(Panel 3: Tintin is examining medical equipment. Snowy is growling softly at Kane.)**

**TINTIN:** Professor Calculus would be fascinated! But for now, we must remain vigilant! This alien creature is unlike anything I have ever encountered.

**Page 4**

**(Panel 1: Kane is sitting up, seemingly recovered. He is eating enthusiastically at the mess hall.)**

**KANE:** I feel as right as rain! That thing just vanished. I can't explain it!

**(Panel 2: Mid-meal, Kane clutches his chest, his face contorted in pain. Suddenly, something bursts from his chest! It's a small, serpentine creature, dripping with alien fluids. It squeals menacingly.)**

**CAPTION:** Zounds! A most alarming turn of events!

**(Panel 3: The crew is scattering in horror. Parker and Bret have grabbed wrenches. Lambert is screaming. Ripley is reaching for a makeshift weapon.)**

**RIPLEY:** After it! Don't let it escape!

**(Panel 4: Tintin, ever the resourceful reporter, has grabbed a fire extinguisher and is aiming it at the fleeing creature.)**

**TINTIN:** Stop, you fiend!

**(SFX: PSHHH!**)\*\*

**Page 5**

**(Panel 1: The Nostromo's corridors are now dark and sinister. The serpentine creature, now much larger and more menacing, lurks in the shadows.)**

**CAPTION:** The beast, now grown to an alarming size, stalks the corridors of the Nostromo! Its motives are unknown, but its intentions are clearly malevolent!

**(Panel 2: Parker is being dragged away by the creature. We only see his terrified face and his wrench falling to the floor.)**

**(SFX: AAAAAH!**)\*\*

**(Panel 3: Tintin, Ripley, and Dallas are huddled together in a storage room, whispering.)**

**RIPLEY:** We have to stop it! But how?

**DALLAS:** (Gravelly voice) I have a plan... but it's risky.

**(Panel 4: Tintin consults his notebook, his brow furrowed in concentration. Snowy glances up at him, awaiting his command.)**

**TINTIN:** Then let us be brave! For science! For justice! And for a good story!

**Page 6**

**(Panel 1: Ripley, piloting a small escape pod, is firing a rocket at the Nostromo as it explodes in a brilliant flash.)**

**CAPTION:** With a daring plan and a touch of luck, Ripley manages to destroy the Nostromo, along with the alien terror!

**(Panel 2: Ripley is floating in space, exhausted but triumphant. Snowy is licking her face.)**

**RIPLEY:** We did it, Snowy. We survived.

**(Panel 3: Tintin, also in the escape pod, is writing furiously in his notebook.)**

**TINTIN:** What an incredible adventure! This calls for a full report! Professor Calculus will be thrilled!

**(Panel 4: The escape pod drifts towards a bright, welcoming star.)**

**CAPTION:** And so, Tintin and Snowy, along with Ripley, continue their journey through the stars, ready for whatever adventures await them! The universe is a vast and wondrous place... and full of endless possibilities!

1j4xvvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NclexUSRNs/comments/1j4xvvt/naxlex_scores_low_but_waiting_results/,Naxlex scores low but waiting results.,"Alright, so here’s the latest chapter in my ongoing saga: I've been getting Naxlex scores which are pretty low. I won’t sugarcoat it when I first saw the numbers, my stomach dropped a little. I’d been grinding for weeks, checking over notes, sipping coffee like it’s my job, and basically living in a state of perpetual flashcards. So, to see a score that didn’t exactly scream ‘you nailed it’ was a gut punch. But here’s the thing I’m still waiting on the official results, and I’m holding onto hope I'll score well in the NCLEX. 
Naxlex, for those who don’t know, is one of those prep tools that’s supposed to give you a feel for how you’ll do on the big test. It’s not the real deal, but it’s close enough to make you sweat. I’ve heard mixed things—some people say it’s brutally tough and undershoots your actual performance, while others swear it’s a solid predictor. Me? I’m choosing to lean into the ‘it’s tougher than the real thing’ camp for now. Keeps the optimism alive, you know?
The waiting part is the worst, though. It’s like sitting in limbo, overanalyzing every question I might’ve missed and wondering if I should’ve spent more time on, say, pharmacology instead of obsessing over cardiac rhythms. My brain’s been playing this fun little game of ‘what if’ what if the results come back and they’re better than I think? What if they’re worse? What if I’m stuck in this weird middle ground where I’m not sure whether to celebrate or cry into a pint of ice cream?
But here’s where I’m at: I’m hopeful. Cautiously, tentatively hopeful. I put in the work. I showed up for myself, even on the days when I didn’t want to. I’ve got friends who’ve been in this exact spot low practice scores, full-on panic mode and they still passed the NCLEX with room to spare. So I’m clinging to that. Plus, I need to hit the weak spots, and go into the actual test ready to fight.
So, for now, I’m keeping my head up. Low Naxlex scores don’t define me they’re just a bump in the road. I’m waiting on those results, and until they’re in my hands, I’m choosing to believe there’s a chance for a plot twist. Anyone else been here? How do you deal with the waiting game? Send help—or coffee. Either works.""",4,1741274609.0,NclexUSRNs,2,1.0,False

This brought something to my brain that I had not thought about previously. How is RS any different than a recip farm? And this is why I ask: How many of KVS’s mares are actually carrying their own babies? How many are Recips? If KVS saw profitability in renting out her mares, do you think she would do it? Does her foal pulling tendencies create pause to other breeders about buying embryos from her and letting her foal the mare out?

We have lived together for about a year and a half. There has been a multitude of stresses that have caused a lot of fighting. Almost everything we fight over is blamed solely on me. From the really big stuff to the dumbest of things like the way coffee cups are stacked in our cabinets. If I back up a little I can explain some of the stresses. Early in in the relationship my ex who is my child's father decided to turn my life upside down and force our child who is 15 almost 16 to move away from me in my state and live with him 5 states away. There has been court dates, lawyers fees and a lot of crying and stress on my end. My partner M 39 has never been married and does not have children. So naturally he can't understand fully how hard this could be as a mother who has always been the primary parent of my child. All of the custody stuff has cost me a ton of money so for months I was unable to help with rent and bills. This rendered us in a situation where he was paying for everything and I was working to pay a very expensive lawyer. The custody Battle is still going on. I live in a state of depression most of the time with out my kiddo in my daily life. It's been the hardest of times for me. And I do not feel supported emotionally by my partner. I struggle daily to survive. Every thing that happens is mostly ""my fault"" and I am stuck defending myself. So all of our money problems are my fault because of the custody Battle and all the money it has costed me. Basically I feel like he is incapable of trusting me or loving me the way I feel I need to be. I have been married before and have had step children. I know how to be a wife and partner. We also experienced a bout of untrustworthy behavior brought into the relationship by myself concerning an Ex. So naturally there are trust issues. Our relationship is not perfect by no means. There have been many occasions where I gave him the option or opportunity to end the relationship and move on. He has chosen to stay with me but then complains about how unhappy he is living with me. We have had a lease end and could have split and moved on but he explained that he is right where he wants to be and that he is highly invested in the relationship. It's confusing to be treated like trash and then told that. Idk where he truly stands. I just want to be happy and it's already hard for me with the custody Battle and daily depression I face so I seek acceptance from my partner and reassurance that this is truly what he wants. Most of the time I think he hates me and say that to him. How could he hate me and choose to stay? That behavior only causes me to question my reality and self worth. Our arguing does affect our intimate life. So there is a lacking on that end as well. I'm hoping for some thoughts or answers or experiences.

1j4xq9r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4xq9r,Review of the Ssangyong/KGM Torres EVX,"After Ssangyong cars went bankcrupt, the industrial conglomerate is now back in the car business under the catchy *KGM* moniker. The Torres EVX is an old-fashioned EV that promises the looks of a Landcruiser/Landrover blend, lots of interior space, a decent range and competent drive, all for a competitive price. It's got a lot of quirks, though, and to get the worst issue out of the way: This two ton rough looking SUV is exclusively available as FWD. Oh well. There's a lot of fakery going on from plastic moldings everywhere to handles on the hood. Even the boot lid has a handle implying a side mounted offroady door, when it does really open like a common wagon.

One of the first things to notice: This car is an unusually intense beeper. It would be easiest to list what it *doesn't* beep for, but most annoying is that the car keeps [beeping extremely loudly](https://streamable.com/81mfiq), and never stops, if you exit it with your keys in your pocket. In cold climates, where people leave their cars running in front of shops, this is a terrible solution. Another annoyance are the mandatory speed warnings, which, unlike at BYD and others, require a menu deep dig to turn off. It's also not built to overtake anyone, ever. Because when you cross lines, the car will ask you to take a break with a big coffee mug image - even if you just left your driveway. Wiggle the car? Sleepy beep. 10 minutes into an ordinary drive? Sleepy beep. Random ""your tire pressure is okay""-display? Beep. Sometimes it beeps without any display warning explaining what for. I could swear I even heard the key beep in my jacket while grocery shopping. Soundwise, the blinker noise is also some kind of [boppety bopp happy sound](https://streamable.com/lx3t8v) like a mix of Polestar and Kia, which is annoying at length.

There's no heat pump and the heating system itself is [quite noisy](https://streamable.com/jsbvcn), especially because the car itself is rather quiet. There are zero rattles and almost everything looks quite well made. Some of the exposed welds in doors and frame as well as the charging port door not aligning with the sheetmetal drag down an otherwise good impression.

While the driving mode selection is inexplicably buried as a submenu of the climate controls (!) - I had to check the manual to find the setting - they do make a fair bit of difference. The Torres can't hide its weight, but it drives very well and feels competent on the road. Contrary to BYD cars, with which it shares its 73 kWh Blade battery, the KGM almost gets to reign in the SUV wobble in SPORT mode which turns your displays a fiery red. I wouldn't want to do a moose test in one, though. Adaptive speed control works, but is unsophisticated with a bungee cord feel to it.

A major disappointment is winter mode, supposed to help you drive in slippery conditions. A slight increase on a gravel road nearby that I have driven in everything from a 1971 Volvo 145 to a 1996 Corolla to a 2023 Leaf [overwhelmed the Torres](https://streamable.com/fnmn75). Antispin stopped the car and it was not possible to start again - I had to reverse down. Surprising and embarrassing. There's a hill descent mode - for forward driving that is - keeping a steady 5-7 kph. Neat.

So with all those weird issues out of the way, I am also a bit embarrassed to admit how much I like it. The KGM drives really well and its cubist design makes it easy to navigate - despite the terribly massive C pillar that pointlessly removes almost all of your three quarter rear vision and despite its rather big size. I drive new and old cars all the time, in a quest to rotate our fleet and because I love getting to know all these different kinds of cars. The KGM strangely *feels* right. Under its thick layer of oddities, there's an old fashioned wagon lifted to look tough.

It is very airy and spacious inside because of the tall roof and square shape. ""Boxy, but good"", was a crazy men's slogan for another car, but it applies here, too. The boot is a bit oddly shaped, possibly because the gas version of the Torres is available as 4WD? A solid share of its space is wasted with an underboot thingamadingy that has barely any purpose.

Another feature I really like is that heated seats and steering wheel do not turn themselves off on a timer, like most Japanese, Chinese and Korean cars do. This is usually another inexplicable programming blunder for me; why would anyone want the car to decide to turn these comfort features off? The Torres even remembers to keep the steering wheel heat on for your next drive, like button cars used to. Curiously, it forgets my preference for heated seats, though.

Finally, this brick of a phony SUV is quite efficient. KGM claims .18 kWh/km and while driving around on my ""home office"" day, the car seemed to be as efficient as our Leaf, which is another ugly, old-fashioned EV without a heatpump, but also lighter and smaller. Starting at about 430k NOK/39.6k USD, albeit with a predicted sharp decline in value, I think this is a big car that does well for a reasonable price. That also includes a [battery warranty good for 1000000 kilometres](https://kgm-auto.no/modeller/torres-evx) and a trailer weight of up to 1500 kg. Neat.",1,1741274200.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,1,1.0,False

I'm always thinking of my Chinese female colleague, but I don’t know if this is love, obsession or admiration. I wonder if there’s even a chance with her. (Delulu!!)

Context:
I have a female colleague who is pure Chinese and only stays in the Philippines for 1-2 weeks every year. When I started working at the company, I wasn’t interested in her at first since she is one of my bosses.

Around September 2023, we had a personal conversation. At the time, I was 23 years old (F), and she was 34, single (which, based on old Chinese culture, might mean she’s considered a ""leftover woman""). I’m naturally drawn to philosophy and intellectually stimulating topics, and I found her beautiful—maybe because of her fair skin (Chinese genes). I also heard she comes from a very rich family, has a master’s degree from the U.S., and speaks fluent English.

What really attracted me to her, though, is how she carries herself—a bit tomboyish but still feminine, intelligent and mature. In 2024, when she visited the Philippines again, I invited her to dinner, and she accepted. We talked for four hours about anything and everything.

Since then, she’s been on my mind constantly like I always wanted to hear about her. I feel shy whenever I see her, but realistically, we come from two different worlds—she’s from China, I'm also a female 🥹, 35 years old (10 years gap), extremely wealthy, drives luxury cars and motorcycles, and has a successful career. She even had clothes that worth my 1 month salary 🥹🥹😭

Yesterday, since she returned again in the Philippines I invited her for coffee, and she said yes. Now, I’m just waiting for her to let me know when she’s available.",2,1741274068.0,adviceph,6,1.0,False

That's why I've been a member of this community for as long as I have. 

However, ever since Trump's asinine trade war kicked off, this sub has been flooded by virtue-signalling Americans, Brits, and even other Canadians who spam news articles and ""I'm doing my part!"" posts, completely drowning out content which actually fits the true intent of the sub: raising awareness about Canadian products.

For example, I went through my browsing history for January, and here are some of the posts I interacted with in this sub:

- January 9th: [B3 Sheepskin Bomber Jacket by World of sheepskin in Winnipeg](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1hxiqpe/b3_sheepskin_bomber_jacket_by_world_of_sheepskin/)
- January 17th: [Birch Bark Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1i3t50h/birch_bark_coffee/)
- January 27th: [Why I buy French's Ketchup, and why you should too](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1iax8re/why_i_buy_frenchs_ketchup_and_why_you_should_too/)

All of these posts promote Canadian products, some of which I might have never heard about if I didn't browse this sub. Even the most trade-war-adjacent post of the bunch at least explains the history behind choosing French's ketchup over Heinz. This is genuinely useful information.

Compare this to the currently most upvoted posts on this sub, all of which have been posted within the past month or so:

- [$1 billion worth of American alcohol bottles removed from shelves in Ontario alone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1j3ndq7/1_billion_worth_of_american_alcohol_bottles/)

It's not beyond saving by any means - [this megathread from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1j4kooz/megathread_for_canadian_made_video_games/) is an incredible repository of Canadian-made video games, for example. But posts like this one have become few and far between.

I understand that it is important to see proof that your individual actions can make a big difference, or that our leadership is doing a great job of standing up to American warmongering. I can read or watch the news for that. 

What I can't get from reading or watching the news are genuine reviews by genuine Canadians about genuinely Canadian products, which is a niche that this subreddit used to fill.

Does anyone know the name of this dessert? I asked him but couldn't understand his reply :( . 

He also told me a story about another brother of his who was recently found in one of Assad's prison's after decades of incarceration. His whole family believed he was dead and it was pretty cool seeing the happiness on his face just talking about it.

I just saw a post suggesting that Daniel Biss is putting up spoiled candidates but with no proof. 

If you’re on here.. which candidate? Be responsible and at least name them and let them defend themselves. 

I’m voting for Jeff B but honestly the way they attack candidates with no proof is unnecessary and irresponsable. Whoever runs this group should put up a forum and ask the questions directly. 

The post they share is from a big Cannon supporter. And Cannon is part of DPOE and therefore close to Daniel Biss, so if anyone is a spoiled candidates—I think it would be the one who has ran 3 times and never wins. 

Evanstonians, I get speaking out against E45 or rezoning when you put up the proof by showing us the meetings and documentation but it is irresponsible to accuse a candidate of being ‘spoiled’ without proof. 

By the way, Cannon wants to promise affordable housing for everyone? Yeah, I’ve heard her talk at her coffee meetings. How? This is a free market and capitalism is real. How is she going to make my $2,400 rent go down? 
How are you making my groceries cheaper?

On another note, I think those of us who are informed saw the way Cannon separated our community when she was chair of the Equity and Empowerment Committee. 
If she could not even run a committee, how is she going to oversee a whole ward? 

What’s the plan? Not the idea..but the actual written out plan to get there!

Old World Coffee, Coffee N’ Comics, Hand Craft Cafe Coffee Company, Stella Coffee Company, Cafe Con Papi and Hub Coffee Roasters.

Caffeine tends to be an essential part of many daily routines. Even though coffee can be easily made at home, for much cheaper, why do we still buy cups of coffee from coffee shops? Here’s a five part listicle I came up with. 

**1. ATMOSPHERE**

The design of a coffee shop from the outside to the inside influences its overall vibe. The smell of freshly roasted beans, the sound of the pleasing music and the look of clean and well laid out tables provide important atmosphere cues for customers.

For some, the welcoming ambiance, even if the coffee tastes OK, is a good enough reason for them to stay and come back regularly.

And for students, a well-designed shop can be an ideal place to study and be productive, whether that is alone or with a group. Seeing others engaged in focused activities can create a sense of accountability and inspire them to do the same.

**2. CUSTOMER SERVICE**

We love interacting with other people, especially when they are attentive, friendly and personable. Going to a coffee shop instead of making coffee at home allows for a welcoming and personalized experience with the local baristas. Nothing sounds better than starting the day greeted with a smile and engaging in a friendly conversation.

And if a customer is already a regular, sometimes shops will remember names and orders which create a sense of familiarity, and a sense of belonging we all desire.

**3. QUALITY COFFEE AND FOOD**

A coffee shop wouldn’t be a coffee shop without coffee. Most shops have a variety of coffee types to choose from while one’s home may solely have instant coffee and whole milk. To be honest, coffee at home just doesn’t taste the same as coffee from a cafe.

The differences in the quality of beans, the brewing method, the water quality, and the freshness of the grind are only some of the influencing factors. Their fancy coffee machine with its hundreds of buttons will also probably produce a way better tasting cup.

On top of that, some cafes offer food on their menu. What is better than drinking your iced caramel macchiato or dirty chai with a croissant on the side? For people who are on the go, it can be more convenient to stop by a coffee shop that will provide an energy boost and satisfy hunger simultaneously.

**4. CONVENIENCE**

Most customers juggle an active lifestyle of work, school, family, and other social activities. Having a coffee shop down the street will make it more likely for people to buy rather than make. Especially when the service is speedy without sacrificing quality.

Convenience can also entail takeaway options like drive-thrus and amenities like plenty of seating and high-speed wifi. It is also helpful when cafes have a mobile pick-up option so customers can come in and out within seconds. Its atmosphere, location and services make coffee shops an ideal place to work and be productive.

For some, this matter of convenience makes a $7 latte + tip worth it.

**5. COMMUNITY**

Good coffee shops involve their community. They promote local businesses and artists, host local events and actively involve themselves with relevant activities. The gatherings they hold can be the perfect place to meet new people with similar interests. Or simply a place to meet a friend and gossip for hours on end.

When people visit coffee shops, they are supporting a local business which might be sourcing locally as well. This creates a feeling of shared investment in the community.

*With this being said, why do you buy overpriced coffee even when you have already told yourself you are saving money this week?*

She doesn’t do makeup tests and will not open the door for anyone that comes in late on a test day, so I sent my teacher this email:

Hi Miss [teacher]…
Just to start off, as soon as I awoke this dreadful morning and saw the time, the first thing I did was rush to the syllabus on canvas, so I am already aware that you do not offer make up tests, as per the natural science department decrees. However, in the spirit of grief and much regret for my “ambitious” choice to stay up and continue reviewing the material into the wee hours of the night, I am asking you to extend me an olive branch. It says in the syllabus that in the event of a make up test, the final grade will replace the missed test, but I am also aware that the sole cause of my absence this morning can be attributed to none other than my severe lapse in judgement in assuming six alarms would be sufficient to wake me from my deep slumber. 
I understand that my request is a bit bold, and, the intelligent person that you are, you may be pondering, “What’s in it for me?” Allow me to elaborate. My current degree is aerospace engineering, and I have a strong passion for it. In order to study this degree at the university level as I plan to come fall, it is imperative that I pass chemistry. This has proven to be quite the feat this year that I did not anticipate. Back to my point, however; if you were to, hypothetically, allow my final grade to cover this fatal mistake I have made this dreadful morning, I shall forever be indebted to you. If you consider this for a moment, having an aerospace engineer indebted to you seems a valuable thing, no? Perhaps not. It seems I am grasping at straws, and for that I apologize. Forgive me for feeling a bit of desperation in my time of grieving what could have been if only I had set seven alarms instead of six.
I ask that you receive this carrier pigeon (email) with an open heart, and should you decide to spare my fate, you need nothing more than to respond with your favorite coffee order, and I will deliver the Tuesday we return from spring break, wherein I shall be on time and present.

I anxiously await your correspondence,
Regretfully, 
[me]

I had an appointment to go pick up my mom early this morning but wanted to grab food. I went and ordered Krystals because thats what I was craving, but the closest one is about 15 minutes away from my house by car, so Uber said it would take around 40 minutes for my food to get here. I was chill with that, and just used the priority button and paid extra so my food was first that way it would get here before I needed to go pick up my mom, so it got knocked down to about 33 minutes. I was given this one driver who at first was fine, nothing out of the ordinary, until he missed 3 exits and started driving into a different city. He also kept stopping on the sides of roads and not moving. It was getting closer to the time, so I asked him 'Are you here?' because it was the prebuilt message and I don't really like texting people while theyre driving. Then his car stopped, and it stopped for a while. Almost 10 minutes later I asked him 'Where are you' because at this point he was still in the other city all the way past my house thats over 20 minutes away. He responds a minute later and says that hes coming and he had to get gas because his gas ran out. That was odd to me because he would have had to pass 4 different gas stations in order to get to the one all the way up there but I said oh ok and he responds that he's on his way. Then I see his car move towards a gas station so I assume that maybe my Uber map is not up to date, but from what it looked like he just reversed into it. I respond like three minutes later with 'Alright' and wait for a bit before telling him that it shows he was at the gas station still for me on my screen, but think nothing of it because now I have to go pick up my mom to lend her the car. Her house is 15 minutes away from my house, aka where I had the drop off point for the food. Once I get there, I check the map and it shows that we passed each other, but that he is on the way to my house. While I'm on the way back to my house, it shows that he still had not dropped off the food, which I thought was weird because he should have been there by now, but instead I watch the screen and he starts doing literal laps around my neighborhood and going into random surrounding parking lots and sitting in them for a minute then continuing. I'm about 3 minutes away from the house so I texted him 'Are you lost?' and 'Its been almost 2 hours of you driving with my food, did something happen after you went to go get gas?' because now I am starting to think that maybe he just wants me to cancel the order so he can get free food. However, when I'm driving up to my neighborhood, I see his car that is sitting in this corner area that is not supposed to be driven in and he does a crazy U-turn to the point where it kicks up dust, and speed into my neighborhood. So while I'm driving, he keeps pulling to the side and my mom and I end up sitting in front of the house waiting for him to drop the food off. (My mom is actually the one driving me back home since she needs to lend the car, and when I told her about it after I picked her up she took me to a coffee shop nearby that had basically the same thing I had ordered from Krystals). My mom pretends to be a delivery driver and takes the food we just got to the front door and takes a picture of it and waits to see if he would do the same, and he does. He takes a picture of the food from inside the car and leaves it at the door. Then when I finally go inside he waits outside of my house for almost 15 minutes. I reversed the tip and my mom told me not to eat the food because she says he could have tampered with it, and when I opened the bag the food I ordered was opened and I can't tell if I am looking at spit or just grease and that the stress is making me overthink everything. I would post pictures but all the screenshots I have show his name, car model, and plate numbers along with the area I stay in because I have several screenshots of him circling around the neighborhood. Can anyone think of any reasons this could have been happening or maybe a similar story and advice on what I should do?

My local shop brewed me an incredible flat white a few days ago using a peach co-fermented coffee by Traffic, and I was so floored by it that I immediately grabbed a bag of their honey green apple co-ferment to take home with me.

I've brewed a couple decent drinks with it so far, but it's noticeably... less flavourful all around than what was pulled by the barista at my coffee bar? In his drink, the peach was borderline overwhelming on the palette, it was incredible!! Here at home, the apple is very faint by comparison. I'm getting subtle notes of apple, lemon, caramel, and chocolate, which seems like I'm on the right track, but I don't know how to oomph it up?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j4xbm9,https://i.redd.it/yhn85fiz23ne1.jpeg,Day 28 – A Personal Reflection,"Hey everyone, I want to take a moment to reflect on today—what’s going well and what still needs improvement.

Wednesday – Day 28
Today feels like one of those long, exhausting days that seem to stretch on forever. It starts off on a good note—I wake up on time, have my usual breakfast and coffee, and get to work early. But once work begins, the hours drag on, and I’m constantly on the move. By the time I clock out, I’m already drained, but the day isn’t over yet.

I make a ton of phone calls—sorting out school matters, handling house responsibilities, and coordinating the sale of our car. After that, I pick up my girlfriend, and we run some errands together. When we get back, she starts cooking dinner while I focus on getting the car ready to sell. Eventually, we sit down and have dinner together, which is a nice little break from the chaos.

Later, we meet with a buyer for the car. We end up selling it for a little less than we hoped, but honestly, it’s a relief to finally let it go. What really catches me off guard, though, is the unexpected news that we might be moving our camper much sooner than planned—possibly tomorrow. That hits me hard because, in many ways, this whole journey started with the goal of becoming a better person before this big move.

I’ve been carrying a lot, and I don’t want to bring any of my past struggles into our new home. I want this to be a fresh start. That’s why I decide to tell my girlfriend about this account and the progress I’ve made. I’ve kept it from her until now, but I hope she understands why. More than anything, I want us to tackle this together. I’m excited about our future, and I know this is a turning point—there’s no room for mistakes. This is the real deal.

One thing I’m genuinely proud of is how much I’ve matured, especially when it comes to bedtime. I’ve learned to read the room better and respect when my girlfriend isn’t in the mood, rather than trying to change that. It’s a small but significant shift, and I feel good about it.

On the other hand, something I still need to work on is giving her more personal space. Just because she’s being open or affectionate doesn’t mean it’s an invitation for me to be all over her. I need to respect her boundaries more, so that when I do reach out to her, it feels more meaningful and genuine.

As always, I’m rooting for everyone on their own journeys. Keep pushing forward—you’ve got this!

Café Tuberosa from Atelier Cologne is like sitting at a French coffee shop with a cup of café crème and an éclair, and there are tuberoses on every table. French tuberoses— a touch cool and mentholated— which perfectly frame the warm coziness of the coffee and chocolate. 

I was worried that like every coffee fragrance before it, Café Tuberosa would turn burnt and ashy on my skin. Instead it remains a voluptuous floral gourmand for the course of its life. Projection is moderate but quite present. Longevity is excellent.

I work as a literary translator, so I spend a lot of time reading, writing, and editing.

At my last house, we lived in a cul-de-sac that became completely terrorised by a family across the road with four kids. The kids were absolutely feral, and would scream ear-splitting blood-curdling screams all day, as well as throw gravel at cars and windows, and abuse the local cat population.

The experience was such an utter misery, that we had to sell up fast and move, as it affected my ability to work, and I had trouble sleeping with the constant screaming, arguments, and general drama caused by this one family across the street.

We now live in a very rural location with a big garden. It's lovely because I can sit in the garden, read through a translation and makes notes while listening to birdsong.

A few weeks ago, a couple moved in to the house next door, and we made friendly smalltalk when we bumped into each other outside. During our chat, they told us they had six children, all under 10.

My heart immediately sank. The property next to us isn't that big, and it's more suitable for a retired couple than a large family. Our garden is very big, so there is distance between us, but even so, I immediately started planning our get out plan, and started thinking about putting my beautiful house up for sale.

But you know what?

It's actually been fine. The kids are all exceptionay well behaved. They play outside daily but I can barely hear them. They're respectful, and listen to their parents, and they haven't caused any disruption at all.

The experience has honestly made me realise that shitty parents have zero excuse for not being able to manage their children properly.

I was gaslit so hard at my last property because ""kids will be kids"" apparently means terrorising the neighbourhood and causing property damage. Whereas I'm now next to a family with more children who actually know how to behave.

I'm currently sat outside in my garden, reading a book with a coffee. Meanwhile in the other garden I can occasionally hear the kids playing outside, but it's a normal level of noise, and not anything that is a bother.

I suppose my point is, after experiencing what good modern parenting looks like, it's restored my faith in families, but also made me even more annoyed at the nonsenses I escaped from at my last property.",51,1741272904.0,childfree,3,1.0,False
1j4x8nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j4x8nf/need_some_help_planning_the_right_setup_to_make/,Need some help planning the right setup to make the Mrs. happy [$500-$600],"USA, 2-4 shots for me, 2-4 shots per Mrs. per day. Mrs. is a night shift nurse but is active during the day, and we are new parents, so caffeine has been essential the last few months. 

I have a Delonghi 3420 I bought in 2023, which was a great intro into espresso, and has been decent fun with a couple of bottomless portafilters and a steam wand mod. Recently I bought a bulk bag of whole bean by accident and had to bust out our old spinning blade grinder, and was reminded how good it smells to have fresh ground coffee. I bought a Gevi conical grinder on Amazon and the first time my wife heard it I received 'the look'. Not the good 'the look', the look that says I'm in trouble for disturbing her morning with irritating sounds. I'm writing this as I put off grinding a few more drinks worth of grounds in case it wakes her and the baby up ruining all of our mornings. 

The primary item I am looking for on this post is a better grinder. I am also interested in opinions on the espresso machine, but that's a matter of convenience that I will address at the end. For the grinder, the biggest factor is noise. I see a LOT of single dose espresso machine reviews online, but I'm looking for a hopper style I can refill and get to work, and I haven't found very many reviews of these with volume/db meters involved. I also don't put the extra effort into weighing each shot or dose, I get generally good results by dialing in the grind and dosing by volume. I might experiment with achieving perfect shots later when I have more time in the day, but right now 'good' shots do the job 99% of the time. I would much rather stick to the $250-300 range for this, but I imagine I can wait and budget for something if it seems like the right fit. I have also ordered a hand grinder to try that out, but spending 60+ seconds grinding does not sound that appealing if I am just on a short break with work or trying to leave. 

Less important but still on my mind during this is the espresso machine. I'm not all that picky, but my wife likes large lattes (12oz/350ml of almond milk), usually while I'm working from home or about to leave for work. After watching quite a few reviews I believe what I want is a thermoblock for fast water heating, a solenoid valve to prevent dripping after finishing a shot, automatic shot pouring/timing, and a multi hole steam wand for faster steaming (or maybe this is just common with more powerful machines). Blooming options seem like they would be fun to play with, and autosteaming might save me a lot of effort in the morning while juggling things, but those are optional. The HiBrew H10A and the Bambino Plus both seem to meet the essential criteria, but I've seen negative posts about both, from reliability to availability of replacement parts. I drive an old Honda that I keep in decent shape, I imagine the right machine for me is one I can maintain or repair and keep running for quite a few years, and would consider $500 or a little more for the right solution, pointing me to the Bambino Plus unless that's no longer a commonly recommended device or there is a better fit.

1j4x8ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1j4x8ad/1010_baddie_fall_of_rizzmoy_the_trilogy_concludes/,10/10 Baddie - Fall of Rizzmoy (The Trilogy Concludes),"Mrinmoy, 29, sits at *Momo I Am*, sipping overpriced *lemongrass chicken soup* like a man who has **seen empires rise and fall**. Because he **has.** Once, he was a simple corporate employee with the emotional resilience of an *Amul Butter packet left in the sun.* Then, heartbreak turned him into **Rizzmoy**—the indestructible, ghosting, smirking, lowercase-texting menace of Kolkata.

He **played the game.** He became the *mystery man*. He left women on *seen*, replied with *""idk lol""*, and disappeared for **three days just to test their patience.**

And it **worked.**

For a year, he was **undefeated.** Women who once ignored his texts now sent *""why do you always vanish? 😭""* messages at **2 AM.** He was living the **dream.**

But you see, **every villain eventually faces karma.**

The downfall began **innocently.** A girl named **Tiyasha** entered his life. **Cool. Sarcastic. Immune to his nonsense.** Their first conversation went like this:

Mrinmoy: *""yo.""*

Tiyasha: *""i have a job, type properly.""*

**Intriguing.**

He tried his *Walkaway Method™.* **Left her on seen.**

**She did not text back.**

**48 hours passed.** Nothing.

**72 hours.**

**One week.**

*Tiyasha was built different.*

Mrinmoy cracked. **Texted first.**

*""wyd?""*

**""reading. why?""**

The **tables had turned.** He was no longer the hunter. **He was the prey.**

And worst of all? **He liked it.**

One rainy evening, he did something **outrageous.** Something **he swore he’d never do again.**

He sent…

**""Good morning ☺️.""**

He stared at the screen in horror, realizing he had **become what he once despised.**

**Tiyasha took six hours to reply.**

*""sup?""*

Mrinmoy **felt it.** His stock price was **crashing.** This was **Olypub 2.0.** But instead of running, he **fought.** The **simpness was consuming him.**

The entire **rizz-building empire collapsed.**

Mrinmoy, once the **undefeated, the ghosting GOD**, was now **double-texting.** **TRIPLE-TEXTING.**

*""Have you eaten?""*

Pritam, his oldest friend, watched in **horror.**

*""Bro, you’re SENDING GOOD MORNING TEXTS?""*

*""She likes books, Pritam.""*

*""So? Buy a Kindle and move on.""*

But no. It was **too late.** He had already **fallen.**

Then, one evening at *Sienna Café*, it happened.

Tiyasha walked in. Looking **effortlessly cool**, wearing a loose sweatshirt and **zero respect for his ego.**

*""Hey, Mrinmoy.""*

*""Hey.""*

They ordered coffee. The tension? **Thicker than Park Street traffic at 6 PM.**

*""So, are you done being Kolkata’s most dangerous flirt?""* she asks, dunking a fry into mayonnaise with the **casual arrogance of a woman who has never been left on ‘seen’.**

Mrinmoy sighs. **It’s over.**

And then, the final blow.

*""So… you like me, huh?""* she asked, stirring her coffee like a **Disney villain**.

Mrinmoy, once the **unshakable Rizzmoy**, **choked on his Americano.**

*""W-What?""*

*""Relax. I mean, it’s obvious. You try too hard to be mysterious. It’s cute.""*

CUTE.

Not **dangerous.** Not **intimidating.** Not **enigmatic.**

CUTE.

He had **lost.**

She took a sip. Smirked.

*""You know what’s funny? I actually liked you more when you were normal.""*

Mrinmoy’s **entire existence collapsed.**

**NORMAL?**

The old him? The one who **sent good morning texts** and believed in **loyalty and fair play?** The one who got **ghosted outside Olypub like a street dog?** Ayesha? Moved to Bangalore, where she is still **""figuring things out.""** **(We pray for her.)**

She leaned in,

*""You’re not that guy. You never were.""*

Mrinmoy scoffed. **Not that guy?** Did she not know about the **Rizzmoy era?** The **seen-zone supremacy? The mind games?**

Tiyasha chuckled.

*""You know why you got so good at ghosting women?""*

*""Why?""*

*""Because you were scared of getting ghosted first.""*

Mrinmoy **froze.**

Because… **she was right.**

This wasn’t about Ayesha. Or rizz. Or revenge.

This was about a **27-year-old guy who got ignored outside Olypub and swore vengeance upon humanity, just like Bappaditto from Bagbajar did to Australia after 19th November 2013.**

He stared at his reflection in the café window. He looked like a **man who took dating advice from YouTube shorts.** A man who had spent **one year crafting an aura of untouchable masculinity.** And yet, **here he was.** Holding back a smile like a **fool in love.**

For the first time in a long time, he did something *outrageous*.

He **dropped the act.**

*""Yeah. I like you. But you’re kinda mean.""*

Tiyasha laughed.

*""I know. It’s fun.""*

Mrinmoy **smirked.** Not a fake, *lowercase-lmao* smirk. A real one.

And that night, as they walked through **Southern Avenue**, discussing everything from **Shah Rukh Khan to why people from New Alipore think they’re special**, Mrinmoy realized something.

He was never meant to be a **villain.**

He was just a **middle-class boy with bad WiFi and too much free time.**

And maybe, just maybe, being **normal** was cool too.

He turned to Pritam.

*""I think I’m done, bro.""*

Pritam gasped like he’d been shot.

*""YOU CAN’T RETIRE. WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO GIVE BAD ADVICE TO NOW?""*

*""Try therapy.""*

Pritam’s soul left his body.

Mrinmoy turned back to Tiyasha.

*""Want to grab a drink?""*

She smirked.

*""Are you going to leave me on ‘seen’ tomorrow?""*

*""Not unless I die in my sleep.""*

*""Romantic.""*



The next morning, he did something insane.

He sent **""Good morning ☺️.""**

Tiyasha replied **instantly.**

*""morning ☺️.""*

Mrinmoy put his phone down and smiled.

Day broke. Night fell.

**Tonight, he wasn’t Rizzmoy.**

**Tonight, he was just Mrinmoy.**

And that was enough.

1j4x5ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cleaningandtidying/comments/1j4x5ty/how_can_i_explain_to_my_partner_that_even_though/,How can I explain to my partner that even though he is doing housework (and that's great) that he needs to help with organising daily clutter too?,"My partner is great and he does the housework but he's still messy. Like he'll clean the bathroom and do dishes/clean kitchen or we euqually share the clothes washing. It will look spotless in those areas. But then when it comes to daily clutter he seems to ignore it.

I also do a fair share of housework and we swap chores we don't like to do with each other. However I feel like I do alot more daily to keep it from getting messy whereas he does deep cleans more often. 

I've just come back from home from a week away without him and the living room looks so cluttered. Like the seat cushions were falling off the couch And I forgot to tidy up my morning tea (I left at 5am so just forgot) and it's started to go mouldy and I don't understand why he hasn't touched it. Especially since he's done the dishes all week. And stuff like The bed is unmade. It feels like he doesn't want to touch my stuff? But he also leaves his stuff everywhere e.g he is awful for leaving herb jars and utensils out after he cooks despite us talking about It a few times. how it makes my mornings run smoother when the counter is organised/cleaner. It doesn't seem to effect him (I've tried just leaving them out but sometimes they stay for days if he's working) 

I feel like I need another way to explain to him that he needs to help with the clutter? Another example is I've asked before if he can help tidy the living room by helping find a home for what ends up on the coffee table. And he said he'd try to put stuff away as soon as it's used. But I've yet to see him do that, past the day that we talked about it months ago. 

I'm the one that seems to take up organising things but the mental load is something I struggle with presently (in the past i was fine taking on more of that side but right now it's been kinda overwhelming tidying both our stuff away pretty much daily) 

I'm wondering what would be a good way to explain to him that he needs to do more than just deep cleaning 2 rooms/areas every couple of weeks? 

Or maybe even give me examples of systems to make it less overwhelming for myself? 





P.s please don't come at me saying I'm ungrateful or something along those lines. I know Reddit likes to do that. Because I appreciate that he does clean   more than the average guy and we aren't living in a disgusting home despite the tea situation. It could just do with us both keeping on top of clutter more even if it's just what I count as clean..

For those who follow the blog or my Reddit posts, you already saw the [first version of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hfxuq4/tarvolons_2024_recommended_reading_list_holiday/) back in December. But a lot of other people post their favorites lists around that time, and there are still a few new releases coming out, so I like to post an updated version in late winter, just as I put a bow on my Hugo Awards nominating ballot. Most of the content is the same, but I've added a few new favorites, and in keeping with my efforts to try to stay as current as possible on short fiction, I've also included a list of my ten favorite shorter works of the year. 

As always, I can only recommend things I’ve read, which is a lot, but which is not everything. I try to cast a wide net, especially in the shorter fiction categories, but there is so much out there that keeping up would be a full-time job. I've added a handful of novels and more than 30 short stories to my December tally, bringing my reading total to 31 novels, 16 novellas, 64 novelettes, and 228 short stories that were published in 2024. My tastes are idiosyncratic, so just because I loved something does not mean you’ll like it, and just because I didn’t love something doesn’t mean you won’t. But I do my best in limited space to explain what stood out about each work to give other readers a sense of whether it may be for them. 

For those who missed the first post, one big change I've made this year is splitting each category into Top-Tier Favorites and Honorable Mentions. Both categories are still favorites, both are still highly recommended, but I’m just reading and recommending too many stories right now and need to make this list a little less overwhelming. So the Honorable Mentions are split off and get a little bit less word count on the mini-review. But they’re still great stories that are well worth reading. 

Each category is organized alphabetically by author last name, and the links go to full reviews or free copies, where applicable. Because Reddit has a character limit that includes markdown characters, the [blog version has more links](https://www.tarvolon.com/2025/03/06/tar-vols-2024-recommended-reading-list-and-short-fiction-top-ten-awards-season-edition/). If you're looking for the new content, this edition has a new Top-Tier entry from Angela Liu (Short Story), and new Honorable Mentions from Erin K. Wagner (Novel) and C.H. Irons, Wen-yi Lee, H.H. Pak, and A.W. Prihandita (Short Story). And don't miss the Short Fiction Top Ten. 

# Novels

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **The Warm Hands of Ghosts by Katherine Arden** (Del Rey). This story of family, trauma, and grief set during WWI largely eschews combat scenes in favor of dealing with the fallout. A speculative element heavy on memory and questionable bargains dovetails wonderfully with the weight of war to make for a tremendous whole. 
* **The Other Valley by Scott Alexander Howard** (Atria). My favorite novel of the year, a literary time travel tale with a tight focus on an ordinary character dealing with foreknowledge of tragedy. Expertly portrays the mundane moments in a life, but with a time scale that allows it to explore long-term consequences of small decisions. 

# Honorable Mentions

* **Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi** (Knopf). Low-magic, Italian-inspired historical fantasy series-starter, with a coming-of-age and plenty of backstabbing. 
* **The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett** (Del Rey). A fantasy mystery in a fascinating world that does justice to both the “fantasy” and the “mystery.” 
* **Mechanize My Hands to War by Erin K. Wagner** (DAW). Grounded, near-future sci-fi in a world where androids have replaced blue-collar labor, with myriad remarkably well-developed POV characters.

# Novellas

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **It Lasts Forever and Then It’s Over by Anne de Marcken** (New Directions). This disorienting, plotless meditation on meaning and loss from the perspective of a sentient zombie is often confusing but always compelling, with some of the best individual scenes I read all year. 

* **The Indomitable Captain Holli by Rich Larson** (Clarkesworld). The child-perspective narrative voice absolutely steals the show in a thrilling and high-stakes post-apocalyptic adventure that keeps the tension high with secondary POVs from multiple sides of the conflict. 

* **The Butcher of the Forest by Premee Mohamed** (Tordotcom). This quest into an uncanny forest from which no one returns is exceptional purely for the atmosphere, with the lead’s past tragedy and present internal turmoil only adding to its depth. 
* **Death Benefits by Kristine Kathryn Rusch** (Asimov’s). Takes the best parts of a mosaic story and an investigation tale, with a multitude of short segments from the perspective of those who lost loved ones in war, given structure and forward momentum by an investigation into one particular case where the soldier may not actually be dead. The plot is compelling, but the little character vignettes make this my top novella of the year. 

# Honorable Mentions

* **Spill by Cory Doctorow** (Reactor). A story of a hacker and an activist fighting back against the villains behind an oil pipeline—it’s the character voices that make this. 

* **The Tusks of Extinction by Ray Nayler** (Tordotcom). An angry but meditative anti-poaching novella with a variety of perspectives, including a scientist whose consciousness is implanted in a mammoth. 

* **Proof of Concept by Kristine Kathryn Rusch** (Asimov’s). A murder mystery on a spaceship, with loads of pathos and excellent pacing. 

# Novelettes

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **The Aquarium for Lost Souls by Natasha King** (Strange Horizons). A wildly disorienting sci-fi slipstream tale about a woman repeatedly navigating unspace with a mortal wound and the embodiment of the Pacific Ocean as sometimes-ally, sometimes-enemy, all to tell a very personal, human story about coming to grips with relationships that aren’t quite what she thought they were. Ambitious and enthralling. 
* **The Brotherhood of Montague St. Video by Thomas Ha** (Clarkesworld). A quiet and compelling meditation on experience, memory, and preservation of imperfect moments. There’s a bit of a technothriller to give it some plot structure, but this is a favorite for the atmosphere and themes. 
* **The Four Sisters Overlooking the Sea by Naomi Kritzer** (Asimov’s). A beautiful blend of science and fairy tale in a slow-building story of a summer research project in which the speculative and mundane elements dovetail wonderfully into a satisfying and pitch perfect finish. 
* **The Robot by Lavie Tidhar** (Uncanny). A series of slices-of-life in the centuries of caregiving, war-making, isolation, and friendship in the life of the titular robot. A lovely and touching story that effectively stands alone in the *Central Station* universe.
* **Loneliness Universe by Eugenia Triantafyllou** (Uncanny). A story that feels all too real despite the wild premise, in which friends and family suddenly lose the ability to perceive each other in real life and can only connect on social media. Featuring a lead who asks the questions you’d want her to ask when dropped into a bizarre speculative scenario, this one is exceptional more for the way it handles the emotions, examining interpersonal connections through the lens of their loss. 

# Honorable Mentions

* **Something Crossing Over, Something Coming Back** **by Timothy Mudie** (Clarkesworld). A mind-hopping spy returns to meet the man he once impersonated, with a deep dive into his psychology and a deliberately open ending. 
* **Binomial Nomenclature and the Mother of Happiness** **by Alexandra Munck** (Clarkesworld). A scientist becomes obsessed with research into visual perception of emotions, while frequently failing to perceive those around her. 
* **Shadow Films by Ben Peek** (Lightspeed). A fascinating tale of secret messages hidden in films, with forays into conspiracies, aliens, and internment camps. 
* **Signs of Life by Sarah Pinsker** (Uncanny). Reconciliation of estranged sisters, with Pinsker’s trademark unsettling atmosphere and a slow-building speculative element. 
* **Dead Reckoning in 6/8 time by Sabrina Vourvoulias** (GigaNotoSaurus). A thrilling competition with the devil—think The Devil Went Down to Georgia, but with folk dance from Veracruz—that’s long on the power of community and solidarity. 
* **Ol’ Big Head by Melissa A. Watkins** (Lightspeed). A slow-building ghost story with an immersive vernacular narration that provides a quick and compelling hook.
* **The Peregrine Falcon Flies West by Yang Wanqing, translated by Jay Zhang** (Clarkesworld, originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World). A strange but compelling mashup of a yearning for adventure, a love of birds passed from mother to daughter, and first contact. 

# Short Stories

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **A Theory of Missing Affections by Renan Bernardo** (Clarkesworld). Simultaneously a story of sisters trying to maintain a relationship despite vast physical and philosophical distance, plus research into a godlike departed race with a penchant for psychological torture devices. Unified by the exploration of different perspectives, this provides a compelling family drama and an utterly fascinating historical research storyline. 
* **A Lullaby of Anguish by Marie Croke** (Apex). An angry tale of disaster voyeurism, featuring a lead who only wants to move on from the sins of her childhood but a society who won’t let her, this delivers a cathartic clash with a sister’s toxic beau and some fascinatingly complicated family undercurrents. 
* **Afflictions of the New Age by Katherine Ewell** (Uncanny). A story of aging and memory in a world that can halt physical aging but can do little for the mind, told in disorienting snippets from various times that the lead is incapable of distinguishing. The plot is confusing in a way that serves the theme wonderfully—beautiful, unsettling, and deeply compelling. 
* **Grottmata by Thomas Ha** (Nightmare). A sci-fi/horror story of occupation and resistance, with compelling characters and layers upon layers of depth. Ha is an expert at building tension, and that’s on full display here in a piece that fully won me over despite my usual aversion to horror. 
* **The Sort by Thomas Ha** (Clarkesworld). Again, the building tension of the uncanny stands out in this tale of a neurodivergent father and son visiting a small desert town as a road trip stopover. This feels like a piece of a larger story, but it so effectively explores the feeling of parenting someone who is just a little bit different (or *being* someone who is a little bit different) in a setting that perfectly walks the line between eerie and mundane. 
* **Our Father by K.J. Khan** (Clarkesworld). A story of family and sacrifice in long-haul space travel, told in second-person by a narrator who has only years after the fact begun to grasp the challenges faced on the journey. Extremely effectively builds connection to the characters in a very short space—I’m rarely enamored by stories under 2,000 words, and this may be my favorite ever at this length. 
* **Why Don't We Just Kill the Kid in the Omelas Hole by Isabel J. Kim** (Clarkesworld). I love Isabel J. Kim’s entire oeuvre, but this one is particularly excellent. It’s a return to Ursula K. Le Guin’s famed “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,” using the premise to explore social media responses to injustice in a way that’s often laugh-out-loud funny and mirrors Le Guin’s original in the way it explores questions without trying to lead the reader to pat answers. 
* **You Will Be You Again by Angela Liu** (IZ Digital). At first glance, this is a wildly disorienting dementia story that’s a bit chaotic on the whole but has some powerful individual scenes. But a closer look reveals connections that paint a much more cohesive and sinister picture that's compelling on both a personal and institutional level.
* **A Move to a New Country by Dan Musgrave** (Reckoning). A deeply personal story about allocating space on a generation ship, focusing in particular on an ecologist who can’t bear to leave his grandmother behind, regardless of her own wishes. Draws some compelling parallels to other forced relocation in Osage history, but it’s the family story amidst the backdrop of sweeping societal change that makes this so excellent. 
* **Another Old Country** **by Nadia Radovich** (Apparition). A mashup of a couple different folktales from different cultures, coming together in the life of a contemporary teen as magical figures begin intruding on her life. I’m not a big retelling guy, but this one grabbed me from the beginning and never let go, with its compelling narration and focus on translation and culture clash. And it gets even better on reread. 
* **Driver by Sameem Siddiqui** (Clarkesworld). A disorienting tale of an aging driver lamenting the way he’s commonly treated and intermittently reminiscing on various key figures in his life—often told in second-person to absent interlocutors. The narrative voice makes this well worth the read, but the mysterious actions of a strange repeat customer give this one a satisfying plot to go along with that narration. 
* **An Intergalactic Smuggler's Guide to Homecoming by Tia Tashiro** (Clarkesworld). Pretty much what it says on the tin: an intergalactic smuggler returns to her home planet with highly restricted cargo and questions about whether to attempt reconciliation with the sister she’d left years prior. Perhaps not as formally daring as some of my other favorites (or as [Tashiro’s appearance](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/tashiro_11_23/) on my [2023 Recommended Reading List](https://www.tarvolon.com/2023/12/21/tar-vols-2023-recommended-reading-list-holiday-edition/)), but it’s so much fun that it doesn’t matter. 
* **The Patron Saint of Flatliners by K.A. Wiggins** (Mysterion). Another story with a great narrative voice, this one is told by a woman who died of overdose and has since found herself pulled to others on the brink of death. We see one particular attempt to claw a man back from the grave, interspersed with heartbreaking reflections on emotional isolation. A gripping read that never takes the easy way out.

# Short Fiction Top Ten

Everyone else talks about novels, so let's shout out my ten favorite 2024 stories that weighed in under 40,000 words. Again, these are presented alphabetically by author name. They're all great.

# Observations

* Holy wow, what a year for novellas! My five-star rate dropped slightly from the first edition of this list, but this is still the best novella year I've seen by a fair margin. I have two in the Short Fiction Top Ten, and I have more in my Top Tier than I usually have on the whole list. 
* Also, what a year for authors whose last names start with H,  K, M, or R? Look, I didn't name them.
* Every year, I look out for authors who appear more than once on my favorites list—they’re people to pay special attention to in the future. This year, that list is led by Thomas Ha (four appearances), who also appeared multiple times on last year’s list. Ray Nayler appears more than once for a third straight year, and Isabel J. Kim surely would have if she hadn’t been so wrapped up in novel-writing that she only published one story. New to this year’s multiple-favorite list are A.T. Greenblatt, Angela Liu, H.H. Pak, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, and Carlie St. George. And it does not escape my notice that two writers from last year’s multiple-favorites list, Naomi Kritzer and Renan Bernardo, ended up writing some of my top-tier favorites this year. 
* As usual, *Clarkesworld* is here a lot. That’s partially because they publish twice as many stories as most of the other popular genre magazines (at least if you exclude flash, which I do). It’s also partially because they’re just very good at what they do. And finally, it’s partially because I give them the most chances to pleasantly surprise me, regularly reading even the stories that don’t hook me in the opening paragraphs. 
* More than 20 different publications are represented on this list, but only two appear more than five times: *Clarkesworld* and *Asimov’s*. I read a lot more of *Asimov’s* this year than I had in the past, but with six appearances on the list and three in the top tier, it was a revelation.  
* Another pleasant surprise this year was *Uncanny*, a magazine I’ve read a lot in the past but appeared more times on my favorites list this year (four, with all but one in the top tier) than in any previous year. Not sure if they just had a good year, or whether being more intentional about searching for stories on my own instead of following social media buzz made a huge difference in my enjoyment. Perhaps both.
* As far as I can tell, 15 authors on this list are in their first two years of sci-fi/fantasy publishing and are eligible for the Astounding Award for Best New Writer: Leah Andelsmith, Anne de Marcken, Katherine Ewell, Scott Alexander Howard, C.H. Irons, Claire Jia-Wen, Natasha King, Charlie B. Lorch, Angela Liu, Ellis Nye, H.H. Pak, Nadia Radovich, Brandi Sperry, Tia Tashiro, and Melissa A. Watkins. Honestly that is a very impressive number.

In the meanwhile I have been employed by an ambulance company working to transport patients from hospital to home. But it’s 0 hours I think to suit people who do it more casually or while at uni. Before this I worked 15 hours in a bar and 16 hours in a cafe. In order to fit in availability for the ambulance job I need to quit the coffee shop (I like the bar better) but I am terrified to do so because my income will be cut in half, if I don’t get any ambulance work.  I’m not saying I’m not gonna get any ambulance work but it’s 0 hours so nothing is guaranteed and the unknown scares me. I live at home and have very little outgoings so I could live off of just the bar pay but it’s more time, if I get 0 ambulance hours I’ll have too much free time and last time I had that I became depressed because I was inside my own mind. I don’t know what to do, obviously I can’t do it all and I need to leave room for availability for this ambulance job but I am so fearful to take the risk. Does anyone have any advice to make me less scared?

We went for a walk and i brought selfmade cookies and tea. We spent nearly two hours talking to each other, it was really nice. 
But it was just that. I don't feel any urgancy to meet her again, it's not like i don't like her but something just wasn't there i guess. I still had a nice time, it's not like i hated the date, but i just thought it would feel better. There is no excitement, no butterflies, no rose-tinted glasses. I can't really describe it maybe we just didn't click, whatever that means. Seeing that this was my first real date, maybe thats normal or i was expecting too much from just one date?

So here's the thing, she just asked me if i want to go and grab coffee with her next week. And i don't know what to do.

1j4x0xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j4x0xt/profitec_woes/,Profitec Woes,"I'm writing this post to share some experiences with a nearly 10 year old Profitec Pro 500. I bought the machine new in 2017 and for the most part, it worked very reliably....until it didn't.

1 year in, valve at the bottom of the tank failed (\~$30 replacement). 5 years in pressure relief valve (sorry I don't know the official name) failed (\~$30 replacement). Pretty minor stuff. 8 years in, pressurestat failed ($100 replacement). During this time the pump has been in the process of failing, cutting out, failing to engage. Its a sporadic problem that I haven't bothered to replace. Vibe pumps are a $55 part and its a little more involved, but well within the range of stuff you can do yourself.

Shortly after I replaced the pressurestat, the control box failed at which point I had to have it professionally serviced. I couldn't diagnose that problem myself ($400 repair). Then another vaccuum valve failed. Then multiple seals started leaking. Then the pump stopped working if the machine was on for more than an hour. It essentially shit the bed completely around 8-9 years.

Something that I hadn't had to consider before is, ""what do you do when the machine isn't working?"" This may sound silly, but I had numerous issues with a profitec pro 500 that has left me without a functioning setup for most of the time over the last 6 months. I literally never buy coffee from cafes anymore and was surprised that a latte runs around $7 most places near me. I considered getting a smaller, less expensive machine as backup, but that seemed excessive.

I expected to get at least 10 years of use out of this machine. I could keep repairing it, but when you're over 50% out of commission for months on end, it really wears my patience. On a $1500-$2000 machine, you start to get back up to the full retail price pretty quickly when you're constantly replacing electronic components. You don't immediately think, ""Well I'll cut my losses, rather than pay another $100 to fix this."" That felt rash. However, something I didn't realize at the time is that these machines really aren't built to last. If you have a profitec machine over 5 years old with an additional recent major component failure, it might just be time to move on.

I can't imagine buying another profitec or ECM machine. I'd probably sooner quit drinking coffee entirely than go through that again. Seeing the popularity of the GO frightens me. The repair place I went to said ""we make a lot of profit on profitec."" I asked him what machines were good and said he liked La Spaziale, Quickmill and La Marzocco. He said that popular brands like ECM/Profitec, Rocket etc. were ""garbage."" That seemed like an exaggeration at the time, but I'm finding myself more in agreement after my experience.

For context I use good water, keep up with routine maintenance (back flushing, descaling, replace gaskets etc.). I also turn off the machine when its not in use. Its generally on for about 2-3 hours a day on average.",1,1741272296.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1j4x0v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1j4x0v9/feeling_frustrated/,Feeling frustrated,"Daily stomach aches are nothing new to me. But lately I've been feeling bloated, sore, queasy more so then usual for at least 2 weeks. Like there's a bowling ball sitting on my stomach. I ended up leaving work early recently because of sharp side pain and going to the ER Like crying in pain and scared to move. I thought maybe it was an ovarian cyst or something gastro. They gave me some pain medicine, zofran and I think pantoprozale through an IV. Did a CT scan and diagnosed me with colonic stool burden and sent me on my way. Told me to take Milk of Magnesia. I have been taking Miralax, Milk of Magnesia and occasionally Dulcolax stool softener. Coffee used to be explosive on me but not anymore. I make round, rock like stool a few times a week. Flash forward to yesterday. I woke up and took Tylenol and hyoscyamine for my typical morning stomach ache. I don't normally eat breakfast because I wake up feeling full and having flavorless burps. I managed to survive school although I did leave a little early because the pain was starting to intensify but that's normal for me. I went home and ate a little bit of cashew milk yogurt and took a nap and got ready for work. On the way to work, I started to get really bad cramping, spasming, and sweating. Like someone was pulling on and twisting my organs. I just kept saying ow ow ow and I had to put my window down and hold on to the above window handle. Excruciating pain. By the time I got to work, I had my head in my hands and was crying and out of breath. I managed to go in and go to the single stall and the pain hit maximum level. Started getting low stomach and butt contractions and spasms. Still had to push a bit and that opened the floodgates. Not full diarrhea but close and it burned. After sitting there for a little while, round 2 happened and it was so explosive and forceful it felt like my organs were falling out. I was so weak, lightheaded and dizzy afterwards I barely made it out the bathroom. Needless to say I didn't clock in or stay the rest of my shift and ended up calling in. This happens to me a few times a month. No I'm not anxious and no it's not because I don't want to work. I actually hate calling out unless it's a dire emergency. I like money and making my hours. But I have a physically active, standing, lifting, customer facing role. It's not always at work and just occurs randomly. It would be one thing if I felt better afterwards or the next day but I don't. Sure there's temporary pain and queasiness relief but then it comes back and the cycle starts all over again. I did experience loud rumbling later that night and today I feel sore and a bit sharp-crampy, burping air occasionally. It's like someone carved out all of my organs and then sloppily put them back in. My diet is not bad as I am full majority of the time and I am very mindful of what I eat and I cook my own meals 90% of the time. Officially, I am diagnosed with IBS and gastritis from an endoscopy last year. I know that all of the tests I've run have come back normal. And I hate being such a big baby about tummy aches or stomach problems, something that is so common and so normal. I'm so tired of being in pain everyday of my life and not getting better. I told my gastroenterologist NP last month that I feel worse than ever and have been hospitalized twice recently. She said there was nothing else they can do for me and that she would see me in 6 months. She did say that she would refer me to a clinic 2 hours away to get a second opinion on my gallbladder although my HIDA scan came back normal but I haven't heard anything back yet and I probably won't. And if they ever do call me I expect them to say January of 2026. I know when I go back in 6 months nothing will change. The only thing she has done has put me on different PPIs. I'm currently prescribed Omeprazole but it barely scratches the surface of the pain level. Basically does nothing. I'm also supplement with Gas X and Digest Golds. I did request a gynecology appointment at the hospital because if it's not digestive I want to rule that out as well. I got an appointment but it won't be until December. It's made it hard for me to go to work and school. I barely leave the house besides that. I was an active person but now I haven't been to the gym in several months. I'm just super frustrated knowing I have to live with and tolerate the pain everyday and knowing there's nothing I can do. The only thing I can do is complain, wait and try to ignore it which is getting harder to do, and vent online. I hate that this has gone on so long and having to live through it everyday.

I got a coffee and brought a book. I parked at the park but because it looked like it was going to rain, I just sat there with the windows down, reading quietly. After 45 minutes there, I looked up and realized a police officer driving slowly behind me in the parking lot. I thought maybe I shouldn’t have been parked there or something so I pulled out, only to be followed and pulled over. He was extremely handsome. He asked me a few questions and I responded truthfully. When he asked what I was doing at the park, I told him that I just wanted to have a coffee and avoid my mother, which made him smile/laugh. He told me he pulled me over to make sure I was safe and nothing was wrong because he had seen a car similar to mine there for a while before me. He definitely thought I was shady originally. When he asked if I pulled out because I saw him, I told him that I did because that was my first time being pulled over and he scared the fu*k out of me. I regretted not asking if he was single but I didn’t want to on his body cam anyway. He was kind and funny, and I looked like I had just gotten into an argument with someone, which I had. I went home immediately even though he said I wasn’t doing anything wrong and was more than welcome to go back to the park, and called my aunt to tell her I let my soulmate get away. I couldn’t even see his name tag from my seat. Lol is it strange that I want a second chance? Would it be weird to ask him out? How could I even go about that while he’s off-duty?

1j4wsbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1j4wsbt/setting_boundaries_makes_you_lonely/,Setting boundaries makes you lonely,"TW/ sexual assault

I [22F] moved out of my hometown 2 years ago when I started studying at university. At first I was pretty positive about everything, and felt like JUST NOW I truly began the best chapter of my life. In my first week I met a friend that I became inseparable with... doing everything together, going on holidays, breakfasts, coffee study sessions...

Until she went through tough break up, which completely changed her. She began to only care about herself, and could only talk about her sexual partners, experiences with them and everyday dates with new people. I tried to be supportive but I just didn't matter anymore, it was only her and her life that she cared about, and eventually I couldn't take it. It hurt but I ended the friendship.

From that time on, I stuck with my other two friends from the same university. The problem is, I'm the third wheel. They never wait for me, when we sit together they only talk to each other, they never text first or involve me into their plans. Not to mention, my ex friend suddenly wants to befriend them, and they know how she treated me but they see no issue with it. At this point, I don't know which one of them made me feel more betrayed.

As if it wasn't bad enough - in the meantime, I met a guy [30M] and got into my first ever relationship. Which obviously was a disaster, because I'm somehow incapable of meeting people who treat me nicely. He constantly tried to change me, made comments about my looks, and although he worked full time I was mostly paying for us - while he would put snacks on weighting scale just so I don't eat more than him. I left a month ago, when I realized that 1) I deserve better, 2) since the beginning of the relationship  I've been sexually abused (coercion, not stopping when I asked him to, trying to have sex with me over and over when it hurt - until I bled etc etc). And I think this is what fucked me up the most, and ruined my trust in people completely.

Since then, I began to cut people out of my life like crazy. Someone doesn't seem to care about me? Out. Someone never asks how I am? Out. I only talk to my family and two friends now, who sadly live on the other side of the country. And I know this is probably for the better, I know I needed to gain self-respect and finally put myself first.

But no one warned me about the other consequences and the lonliness. Those situations + shitty job + difficult studies put me into depression. I don't know if anything makes me happy anymore, I only feel lonely and angry all of the time. To the point of cutting out people who care about me, because I can't stand the thought of being hurt again, and I began to truly believe I'm not someone that can be liked or loved. I just feel like everyone hates me now.

So... everyone says setting boundaries is self love. So why do I only feel self-hate now? I don't know what to do to make it all get better, I don't know if it'll ever be better. ",2,1741271632.0,lonely,2,0.75,False

1j4wpzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhiteLotusHBO/comments/1j4wpzx/i_felt_very_victoria_this_morning/,I felt very Victoria this morning,"Yesterday evening I took some Klonopin to sleep - this week was carnival in Brazil and I've been taking some pills to feel a little more relaxed during the day since I am not going to the parties and I needed some extra sleep. 

So yesterday evening, I took my klonopin,  woke up today around 9:30 hungry and a little slower than usual. Put on some clothes, giant sunglasses and a cap. Walked bakery to grab fresh bread.

So there I am, waiting in line, not really looking to engage in conversation with anyone. I was functioning on auto-pilot because I needed my coffee first to offset the Klonopin(uppers offsetting downer....). OUT OF NOWHERE, this lady walks to me and starts making small talk :"" omgggg.R, I haven't seen you in a while. How have you been? Where did you go for carnival? The beach was just too crowded... bla bla bla""

And me"" gosh I can't follow a word of what she's saying i just need my fresh bread and my coffee and then I am ready to chat. Right now I'm under the  influence of last night's Klonopin"". Of course I didn't say this.

My answer: hi hello, sure, yeah, of course. I know. I understand. 

Here's my thought: was victoria being a bitch with Kate or she was just processing her drugs from the previous evening and not in a morning?

I've also noticed I've become a non-morning person. I used to wake up very chatty but now during the first hour or two, I just wanna have my coffee, put my su glasses on, read my book (when on vacation) and I do not want to make my small talk. I often wear large sunglasses and baggy clothes, in hopes people won't recognize me on the streets. Am I a bitch? I am not. Its just really hard for me to make concersation in the morning. 

At night I am always the nicest person ever!!

Should we give victoria the benefit of the doubt?

P.s2: Xanax post effects are way softer than Klonopin. If you have a meeting the next day, go with Xanax. Keep klonopin for the days you can wake up as slow as snail.",8,1741271454.0,TheWhiteLotusHBO,1,0.83,False

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

My relationship of almost 3 years (we lived together) ended 3 months ago.

We had many problems and it became a toxic relationship at some point. But the breakup was terrible. It was a surprise for me. She was telling me that she loved me, that I was the most beautiful guy in the world in the morning and then…in just a couple of hours…she started to text me that she wanted to breakup with me and all that stuff. She didnt answer my calls, left me outside the house and she didnt give me the opportunity to talk.

A couple of days later she already prepared my stuff to leave the house with her friends and she agreed to have a coffee.

I was scared to talk to her and ask her to try again because she could became furious again.

She was saying that she was still in love with me and stuff like that. It seemed just a moment for me. I thought it was temporary. But since that day, she doesnt give me the opportunity to talk.

She started hating on me. Blocked and unblocked me many times from social media. So, I went no contact. But then she started “stalking” me on the only platforms she didnt block me.

Then, she had “a moment of weakness” (she called it like that) a month ago where she started posting all romantic stuff that said things like “I’m afraid to love you forever and we wont be in the same room again”.

So I texted her and she seemed to care about me. I saw that as an opportunity to restart and was happy for a bit.

But then…She disappeared again and when I tried to talk to her she treated me like s**t making me feel guilty for everything.

Since that day that she broke up with me, I didnt have the opportunity to ask questions or to talk normally just for an hour.

I suffer from borderline personality disorder and all of this destroyed me completely. I almost ended up to the hospital, I take many meds, and I’m in therapy. But I feel I can’t go on like that…without explanations. I went totally crazy for this situation.

I don’t know why I miss her, I don’t know why everything seems wrong and no-sense, I don’t know why I feel so much guilt on my shoulders…

Please, if anyone could talk to me…pm me. I wanna know if someone was in my situation and how to feel better.",3,1741271325.0,AvoidantBreakUps,2,1.0,False

I was mainly thinking about new equipment and associated additional workflows. 

Currently, I use my Profitec 700 and Lagom Casa 65CL. My shots (In, Out, Time) are quite consistent now but the taste often isn't. I think some inconsistency comes from the new grinder which I am still trying to figure out. After cleaning it, I think I previously didn't always put it together in just the right way. This meant my zero was way off and I had to dial in. I think I'm starting to understand why that is so it shouldn't be an issue anymore. 

Anyway, I basically have no retention issue worth talking about. I measure beans +/- 0.1g and get out what I put in. Maybe +/- 0.2g. I do not RDT for that reason.   
  
I don't use distribution tools or needles. I use a bit of a cheap blind-shaker approach by shaking the ground in the cup that comes with the Lagom Casa and that helps. So I was wondering if there is something I could improve here? Leveling tools, WDT, maybe a self-leveling tamper? (Mine is spring-loaded but not self-leveling.) 

I also still use the stock basket that came with my machine. It's a slightly tampered basket which works well with the 18g in I use. But I was wondering if a new basket might help. Maybe something which puts up a bit more flow resistance to make shots more consistent?

Lastly, I don' store my beans in any special way. I just use the bags they come in. My current go-to roast comes in 500g zip bags with valve, these work well. The alternative roast comes in 250g with valve but without zip. 

So I'm wondering what kind of equipment might be worth while at this point.  
\- WDT Tool  
\- Leveling Tool  
\- Better Tamper (Leveling, >58mm for a better fit)  
\- New 58mm Basket  
\- Bean Storage  
\- Thermometer for Milk  
\- Absurd, but hey: Thermometer to validate my Water temperature? 

What do you think would bring the most bang for bucks?",1,1741271134.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1j4wlci,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SophiaShay7/comments/1j4wlci/dysautonomia_mcas_and_hit/,"Dysautonomia, MCAS, and HIT","I'm sorry you're struggling. It's could be dysautonomia and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) or a Histamine Intolerance (HIT). 

Anxiety and dysautonomia are related in a number of ways:

Anxiety and dysautonomia can share symptoms such as a racing heart rate, rapid breathing, and pounding heartbeat. This can make it seem like anxiety is more common in people with dysautonomia, but research suggests that anxiety isn't actually more prevalent. 

Dysautonomia can cause high functioning anxiety because it's a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which regulates unconscious body systems like breathing and digestion.

Dysautonomia:                                                                        
People with ME/CFS experience a range of symptoms associated with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, also known as Dysautonomia. The most common types of dysautonomia include Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Orthostatic Hypotension (OH), and Neurocardiogenic Syncope (NCS), also known as Vasovagal Syncope (VVS).

[Autonomic Dysfunction](https://mecfssa.org.au/resources/autonomic-dysfunction#:~:text=Symptoms%20of%20Autonomic%20Dysfunction,sexual%20dysfunction)

Ask for a referral to a Neurologist or an Electrophysiologist. They'll evaluate you for dysautonomia.

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):                           
MCAS is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems.

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/related-conditions/mcas)

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>●H1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>●H2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. These medications include Cromolyn, Ketotifen, Lodoxamide, 
Nedocromil, Pemirolast, and Epinastine hydrochloride.

>Other medications used are included here:[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome)

It may be a Histamine Intolerance (HI) instead or MCAS. Because histamine intolerance involves the mast cells, it is often confused with mast cell activation. The difference, however, is that with MCAS, mast cells secrete multiple mediators in addition to histamine—whereas in histamine intolerance, the mast cells release only histamines and nothing else.

If your Allergist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to an Immunologist. Or ask for a referral to a Hematologist who specializes in MCAS.

Many people recommend an elimination diet or a low histamine diet. 

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Diet](https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/8114)

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose. Split these dosages to morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2. 

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS initially. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, watery, and goopy eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee I haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.
I was taking Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. One dose of each morning and evening. It caused worsening tachycardia and adrenaline or histamine dumps. I was also extremely nauseous. That never happened before. I switched to taking one dose of each Cetirizine and Famotidine in the morning only. I had to stop taking them all together. I learned that in some people, MCAS symptoms are too severe that OTC medications don't work. And/or we're allergic to the fillers in the OTCs. That's what happened to me.

I wrote a post about Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HI). It has more detailed information.

[Food Compatibility List-Histamine/MCAS](https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/SIGHI-FoodList_EN_Histamin_alphabetisch_inKategorien.pdf)

Adrenaline dumps can also trigger histamine dumps.
While not directly causing a ""dump"" in the same way, adrenaline release (an adrenaline ""dump"") can indirectly trigger a histamine release in the body, meaning that experiencing a surge of adrenaline can potentially lead to increased histamine levels, which could manifest as histamine-like symptoms in some individuals; this is because both systems are involved in the body's stress response. 

I take Fluvoxamine 25mg for ME/CFS symptoms, Diazepam for Dysautonomia, Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS, and Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast stabilizer). I hope you find some things that help manage your symptoms. Hugs🙏",1,1741271098.0,u_SophiaShay7,0,1.0,False

I have always had a hard time sleeping, since I was at least 2yrs and I'm an adult in my 30s now. Things like night terrors, thrashing in my sleep, ect. I don't take sleep aides outside of the occasional melatonin, it doesn't work well, so I rarely take them. I won't take things like sleeping pills because I'm too paranoid that one day I won't wake up, but they scare me because I sleep way too sound when I take them. Very hard to wake up.

 Anyway the entire reason I'm posting is because I punched my husband in the face in my sleep. I've thrashed before and according to him I have hit him before, but this time I hooked him just right and got him in the eye. No bruise but it's swollen. It hurts him and hes tough. He never complains.  This is the same dude who  after he had surgery did a pirouette JUST so he could go home SOONER. He literally never complains, so I know this is an issue. I love him and everything is fine with us, no like subconscious reasons to  intentionally want to hurt him. I don't ever want to hurt him, but I guess I've just been beating him up in my sleep and he finally just voiced it. I need help to not thrash. I've looked at all of Google's suggestions as well as helpful internet hints, from having a routine, to just watching calm things, or staying off of devices the last few hours before bed, ect. If anyone has more suggestions please let me know. Dr might do a sleep study of I push for it but it requires a 3 hour drive and being away from home a night or two. They've only suggested sleeping pills, on top of suggesting things I'm already doing. Can you lovely redditors help a girl out? I love my husband and don't want to hurt him   in my sleep. I'll have to sleep elsewhere if this happens again. Now that I'm aware this happens more often and consistently, I can't continue to sleep in the same bed. This man is amazing to me, if I'm physically hurting him I have to sleep on the couch. I feel absolutely terrible. This man wakes me up with love, affection, and coffee, even after I freaking decked him. I know it all sounds kind of comical but I'd like a solution so we can keep sharing a bed. Worse comes to worst, the couch will be a permanent change. Not terrible, but I'd rather be able to cuddle in bed, only if I stop thrashing. Thank you in advance!",1,1741270859.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

Some kind of glutinous entity was biting at my heels. Sweat poured profusely down my face as I shouted obscenities into the darkness.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh shit.”

Every door I pulled on was locked, dreadful sounds emitting from beyond. I had to find an exit. I rounded a corner, knowing the thing was creeping closer by the second. I could hear what sounded like whips covered in black oil, wiggling and searching behind me. 

I snuck a glance over my shoulder as I sprinted further down this seemingly endless hallway. Just in time to see a massive tendril snaking around the corner, followed by two dozen more. Two sanguine-colored eyes penetrated the darkness inside them with gleeful excitement. A horrific creature long forgotten by time willed itself fully into view. Its tendrils were spread wide now, licking and whipping every inch of the hallway as it bounded after me at a slow, steady crawl. They left behind a thickening, foul slime trail as it slithered ever closer, its murderous intent palpable.

I finally reached the end of the hallway—the last door to try. My last chance.

Locked.

I pounded on the door frantically.

“God fucking damn it!” I shrieked, to no one in particular.

I knelt, hands on my knees, wheezing through the offensive stench that hung heavy in the air, trying to catch my breath. The whipping of too many appendages grew closer, and the rancid scent grew more pervasive with each passing second. It smelled like someone had slurped up vomit and thrown it back up again.

There was nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide. 

This was it.

I turned from the door, steeling myself and accepting my fate. I raised my arms in front of me, mustering up all the strength I had left.

“COME ON!” I howled with everything I had down the nightmare alley.

The vociferous whipping sounds increased to an overwhelming frequency as the entity appeared before me in its unholy glory. The cracking and slithering of tendrils reverberated against everything around me. The walls seemed to fracture attempting to confine the monstrosity within its borders. I fell back into the door, grabbing my ears to keep them from exploding under the booming echo of horror.

Suddenly, the door behind me swung open, causing me to lose my balance and tumble out into the night air. The back of my head hit the pavement with a crack. 

I heard, in the blackness, the hulking wooden door slam closed with a gust of air.
A harrowing cackle erupted from the other side.

“Well done,” it echoed giddily through the door.

I felt something warm pooling behind my head and then blissful darkness.

The call came in the middle of the night.

Unluckily for me, I had been something of a night owl since getting let go from my job a year earlier. The bills were piling up, and the meager unemployment I had been collecting wasn’t going far enough. At that point in my life, I would’ve taken anything that paid. And I did. I did everything I could to scrounge a living for myself—from painting houses to driving trucks for pay under the table. So, when the call came in the early hours on that Monday, I was already on my second cup of coffee, perusing the wanted ads out of pure desperation.

My cell phone began to ring, much to my confusion. A number I’d never seen before—or since, for that matter—flashed across the screen. I considered it for a moment and thought, fuck it.

I picked it up after the fourth ring and was greeted by an affable voice.

“Hello?” I said curiously.

“Is this Trenton, Cooper?” The voice actually said “comma.”

“Ugh, Cooper Trenton. Yes. Who is this, please?”

“Good morning, Mr. Trenton. This is Albrecht Von. I am the CEO of Dunwich and Co. My call this morning is to inquire if you would be so inclined to interview with us?”

I mean, technically, it was morning if you considered four a.m. to be morning. I personally considered it nighttime, but people in business keep weird hours. Who was I to judge? After all, I was awake as well—and desperate.

I scoured my mind for a memory of applying to the aforementioned Dunwich and Co., but the brain files came up short. I had applied to hundreds of jobs over the past year, so my forgetting one of them wasn’t necessarily outside the realm of possibility.

“Oh, good morning to you too, sir. I am very much interested in an interview,” I exaggerated. I had learned long ago not to shoot a gift horse in the mouth, and I was out of options.

“Positively wonderful. Please bring with you an open mind and a willingness to prove yourself. I will have my secretary email the particulars momentarily.” With that, the line clicked and died.

I found myself standing before an architectural marvel of a building made entirely of concrete the very next morning. It reminded me of Medusa’s hair, the way the sharp edges protruded every which way, almost like a crown. I had arrived fifteen minutes early—something I had done before every job interview over the last year. If it ever helped my case, I’ll never know for sure.

As I pushed through the uninviting aluminum door, I entered what could only be described as a small, innocuous lobby. Little more than an apathetic, tiny room greeted me, a stark contrast to the view from outside. Paint-chipped, monochromatic walls and a mundane desk with a frighteningly pale auburn-haired woman sat sentry ahead of me. Her head was down, almost like she was sleeping, with her hands flat on the desk. To my right was a row of decrepit wooden chairs and an ancient-looking wooden door. I glanced up at a dim, flickering dome light, which seemed to lure and release a family of moths in a never ending dance.

I hated to say it, but even with this place being creepy as all get-out, this wasn’t the worst place I’d interviewed at in the whirlwind that had been the last year of my life. Times were tough all over.

The lady behind the desk suddenly jerked her head toward me with an unnatural, eerie smile. She looked like one of those marionette dolls with the long lines down the side of her mouth. Her sudden movement caused me to stumble a step back. Her eyes were a dull, greyish hue, and it felt like she was looking but not seeing me.

“Name?” she asked bluntly.

“Hi, hello. Cooper Trenton. I’m here to—”

“To see Mr. Von. Have a seat,” she interrupted flatly. Her arm jerked robotically toward the chairs against the wall, then fell limply back down with a thud onto the desk. Her eyes turned away from me, and her head slowly moved back down. The smile never fell from her face.

I took a seat without another word, eyeing her cautiously.

I waited for another fifteen minutes. The woman never lifted her head again until a smartly dressed man with slicked-back blonde hair and piercing green eyes walked in. His suit looked more expensive than the entire lobby.

“Mr. Trenton, it is an absolute treat to… meet you. Albrecht Von.” I stood to grab his extended hand. “I hope we didn’t keep you waiting too long.”

The only thing that was too long was his index fingernail, which was turning a slight shade of purple. The woman behind the desk twitched in my peripheral.

“No, sir. Not long at all,” I answered. He noticed my eyes drift to the woman behind the desk. I thought maybe she was watching something on her phone, but from what I could see, her desk was completely empty. Not even a pen was anywhere in sight.

His eyes shifted for a second to the woman, and I could swear I saw them turn a dark black, but when he turned them back on me, they were a bright green again.

The pale woman just continued to smile at us.

“Thank you, Audrey,” Mr. Von said almost expectantly. He studied me for a moment, and as the moment passed us by he continued. “If you’ll follow me, please, Mr. Trenton.” He opened the ancient wooden door and flicked his index finger over his shoulder, as if to say, this way.

He closed it gently behind us and glided across the floor. The hallway we were in seemed familiar somehow, like I had been there in a dream of a dream. I followed closely behind Mr. Von, passing closed wooden doors on either side with faint sounds coming from beyond.

I almost ran into him as we reached yet another wooden door at the end of the winding hallway. He pushed it open with ease and ushered me inside with wide, eager eyes and a grin plastered too wide on his face. I could feel him oozing anticipation—for what, I had no idea.

As we stepped inside, I felt a slight gasp escape me. There were gorgeous paintings adorning every wall of the room, floor to ceiling. I was momentarily impressed by the sheer volume of these beautiful creations, all gleaming under the warm lights. As I scanned the portraits, one in particular paralyzed my eyes—and then my mind. It was a portly man in his mid-forties, saluting in a too-big sailor’s uniform. It stirred in my brain like someone had taken a whisk to the back of my head, searching desperately to find a connection. A devastating migraine hit me like a battering ram, wave after wave of pain. My eyes shut tight against my will, unknowingly pressing them together as if that would somehow squeeze my brain out through my eyelids and end the agony.

Vivid images flashed like a reel in my mind, over and over again.

a painting of a knight kneeling before a hooded creature.

An auburn-haired girl, 

an armory, 

I grabbed the back of my head, feeling a pitted scar running six inches vertically down to the nape of my neck.

Mr. Von quietly locked the door behind him, positioned himself in front of another door on the opposite side of the room, and turned on his heels to face my pitiful, shaking form.

I forced my eyes open through the agony, just in time to see Mr. Von’s index finger slowly rising to meet his shit eating grin. 

It was a sickly midnight color, and several inches longer than when he’d beckoned me to follow him only moments ago.

Something about that finger felt so familiar to me—something long buried in my mind.

“Welcome back, Cooper,” Mr. Von said excitedly.

I waited for another fifteen minutes. The woman never lifted her head again until a smartly dressed man with slicked-back blonde hair and piercing green eyes walked in. His suit looked more expensive than the entire lobby.

“Mr. Trenton, it is an absolute treat to… meet you. Albrecht Von.” I stood to grab his extended hand. “I hope we didn’t keep you waiting too long.”

The only thing that was too long was his index fingernail, which was turning a slight shade of purple. The woman behind the desk twitched in my peripheral.

“No, sir. Not long at all,” I answered. He noticed my eyes drift to the woman behind the desk. I thought maybe she was watching something on her phone, but from what I could see, her desk was completely empty. Not even a pen was anywhere in sight.

His eyes shifted for a second to the woman, and I could swear I saw them turn a dark black, but when he turned them back on me, they were a bright green again.

The pale woman just continued to smile at us.

“Thank you, Audrey,” Mr. Von said almost expectantly. He studied me for a moment, and as the moment passed us by he continued. “If you’ll follow me, please, Mr. Trenton.” He opened the ancient wooden door and flicked his index finger over his shoulder, as if to say, this way.

He closed it gently behind us and glided across the floor. The hallway we were in seemed familiar somehow, like I had been there in a dream of a dream. I followed closely behind Mr. Von, passing closed wooden doors on either side with faint sounds coming from beyond.

I almost ran into him as we reached yet another wooden door at the end of the winding hallway. He pushed it open with ease and ushered me inside with wide, eager eyes and a grin plastered too wide on his face. I could feel him oozing anticipation—for what, I had no idea.

As we stepped inside, I felt a slight gasp escape me. There were gorgeous paintings adorning every wall of the room, floor to ceiling. I was momentarily impressed by the sheer volume of these beautiful creations, all gleaming under the warm lights. As I scanned the portraits, one in particular paralyzed my eyes—and then my mind. It was a portly man in his mid-forties, saluting in a too-big sailor’s uniform. It stirred in my brain like someone had taken a whisk to the back of my head, searching desperately to find a connection. A devastating migraine hit me like a battering ram, wave after wave of pain. My eyes shut tight against my will, unknowingly pressing them together as if that would somehow squeeze my brain out through my eyelids and end the agony.

Vivid images flashed like a reel in my mind, over and over again.

a painting of a knight kneeling before a hooded creature.

An auburn-haired girl, 

an armory, 

I grabbed the back of my head, feeling a pitted scar running six inches vertically down to the nape of my neck.

Mr. Von quietly locked the door behind him, positioned himself in front of another door on the opposite side of the room, and turned on his heels to face my pitiful, shaking form.

I forced my eyes open through the agony, just in time to see Mr. Von’s index finger slowly rising to meet his shit eating grin. 

It was a sickly midnight color, and several inches longer than when he’d beckoned me to follow him only moments ago.

Something about that finger felt so familiar to me—something long buried in my mind.

“Welcome back, Cooper,” Mr. Von said excitedly.

1j4wgyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1j4wgyt/team_building_pt_2/,Team Building Pt. 2,"I was being chased through an endless maze of putrid, ancient wooden doors. Some kind of glutinous entity was biting at my heels. Sweat poured profusely down my face as I shouted obscenities into the darkness.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh shit.”

Every door I pulled on was locked, dreadful sounds emitting from beyond. I had to find an exit. I rounded a corner, knowing the thing was creeping closer by the second. I could hear what sounded like whips covered in black oil, wiggling and searching behind me. 

I snuck a glance over my shoulder as I sprinted further down this seemingly endless hallway. Just in time to see a massive tendril snaking around the corner, followed by two dozen more. Two sanguine-colored eyes penetrated the darkness inside them with gleeful excitement. A horrific creature long forgotten by time willed itself fully into view. Its tendrils were spread wide now, licking and whipping every inch of the hallway as it bounded after me at a slow, steady crawl. They left behind a thickening, foul slime trail as it slithered ever closer, its murderous intent palpable.

I finally reached the end of the hallway—the last door to try. My last chance.

Locked.

I pounded on the door frantically.

“God fucking damn it!” I shrieked, to no one in particular.

I knelt, hands on my knees, wheezing through the offensive stench that hung heavy in the air, trying to catch my breath. The whipping of too many appendages grew closer, and the rancid scent grew more pervasive with each passing second. It smelled like someone had slurped up vomit and thrown it back up again.

There was nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide. 

This was it.

I turned from the door, steeling myself and accepting my fate. I raised my arms in front of me, mustering up all the strength I had left.

“COME ON!” I howled with everything I had down the nightmare alley.

The vociferous whipping sounds increased to an overwhelming frequency as the entity appeared before me in its unholy glory. The cracking and slithering of tendrils reverberated against everything around me. The walls seemed to fracture attempting to confine the monstrosity within its borders. I fell back into the door, grabbing my ears to keep them from exploding under the booming echo of horror.

Suddenly, the door behind me swung open, causing me to lose my balance and tumble out into the night air. The back of my head hit the pavement with a crack. 

I heard, in the blackness, the hulking wooden door slam closed with a gust of air.
A harrowing cackle erupted from the other side.

“Well done,” it echoed giddily through the door.

I felt something warm pooling behind my head and then blissful darkness.

The call came in the middle of the night.

Unluckily for me, I had been something of a night owl since getting let go from my job a year earlier. The bills were piling up, and the meager unemployment I had been collecting wasn’t going far enough. At that point in my life, I would’ve taken anything that paid. And I did. I did everything I could to scrounge a living for myself—from painting houses to driving trucks for pay under the table. So, when the call came in the early hours on that Monday, I was already on my second cup of coffee, perusing the wanted ads out of pure desperation.

My cell phone began to ring, much to my confusion. A number I’d never seen before—or since, for that matter—flashed across the screen. I considered it for a moment and thought, fuck it.

I picked it up after the fourth ring and was greeted by an affable voice.

“Hello?” I said curiously.

“Is this Trenton, Cooper?” The voice actually said “comma.”

“Ugh, Cooper Trenton. Yes. Who is this, please?”

“Good morning, Mr. Trenton. This is Albrecht Von. I am the CEO of Dunwich and Co. My call this morning is to inquire if you would be so inclined to interview with us?”

I mean, technically, it was morning if you considered four a.m. to be morning. I personally considered it nighttime, but people in business keep weird hours. Who was I to judge? After all, I was awake as well—and desperate.

I scoured my mind for a memory of applying to the aforementioned Dunwich and Co., but the brain files came up short. I had applied to hundreds of jobs over the past year, so my forgetting one of them wasn’t necessarily outside the realm of possibility.

“Oh, good morning to you too, sir. I am very much interested in an interview,” I exaggerated. I had learned long ago not to shoot a gift horse in the mouth, and I was out of options.

“Positively wonderful. Please bring with you an open mind and a willingness to prove yourself. I will have my secretary email the particulars momentarily.” With that, the line clicked and died.

I found myself standing before an architectural marvel of a building made entirely of concrete the very next morning. It reminded me of Medusa’s hair, the way the sharp edges protruded every which way, almost like a crown. I had arrived fifteen minutes early—something I had done before every job interview over the last year. If it ever helped my case, I’ll never know for sure.

As I pushed through the uninviting aluminum door, I entered what could only be described as a small, innocuous lobby. Little more than an apathetic, tiny room greeted me, a stark contrast to the view from outside. Paint-chipped, monochromatic walls and a mundane desk with a frighteningly pale auburn-haired woman sat sentry ahead of me. Her head was down, almost like she was sleeping, with her hands flat on the desk. To my right was a row of decrepit wooden chairs and an ancient-looking wooden door. I glanced up at a dim, flickering dome light, which seemed to lure and release a family of moths in a never ending dance.

I hated to say it, but even with this place being creepy as all get-out, this wasn’t the worst place I’d interviewed at in the whirlwind that had been the last year of my life. Times were tough all over.

The lady behind the desk suddenly jerked her head toward me with an unnatural, eerie smile. She looked like one of those marionette dolls with the long lines down the side of her mouth. Her sudden movement caused me to stumble a step back. Her eyes were a dull, greyish hue, and it felt like she was looking but not seeing me.

“Name?” she asked bluntly.

“Hi, hello. Cooper Trenton. I’m here to—”

“To see Mr. Von. Have a seat,” she interrupted flatly. Her arm jerked robotically toward the chairs against the wall, then fell limply back down with a thud onto the desk. Her eyes turned away from me, and her head slowly moved back down. The smile never fell from her face.

I took a seat without another word, eyeing her cautiously.

I waited for another fifteen minutes. The woman never lifted her head again until a smartly dressed man with slicked-back blonde hair and piercing green eyes walked in. His suit looked more expensive than the entire lobby.

1j4wdjy,https://i.redd.it/yierrgn5v2ne1.jpeg,"New Room Mate, New Cat, New Target?","I just recently moved into a 2 bedroom apartment, with a room mate. Her cat is a 2-3yr old male, and is the “main” cat. I brought my cat, Shadow, a 4-5yr old female with me as it was cat friendly and the major reason I chose this place. They are both rescue cats.

I have been living here now for about a week, and recently my room mates cat has started attacking my legs for NO reason. Eating breakfast at the table? Attacks and scratches my legs. Trying to pour coffee? Same thing. It’s not a “I want to play”, either it’s quite aggressive. I haven’t let my cat (Shadow) out of my room yet, as we are doing a slower introduction. When she is out, he doesn’t go to attack her or anything, mostly just stares in awe and lets her wander - but it stresses her out as she hasn’t had much past experience with other cats. When she gets too stressed, I pick her up and move her back into my room and what does he do? ATTACK my legs. Again. 

I’m going to get a Feliaway diffuser when I get paid tomorrow to help them, they seem to be doing fine when out and about together minus my Shadow being stressed after an amount of time. 

But HOW do I get my room mates cat to stop fricken scratching the crap out of my legs? It’s unpredictable, and quite frustrating. 

I have attached a picture below (it’s winter and I’m single, don’t mind my hairy legs okay? lol) to show the damage he’s caused in just under a week. At first he loved me and didn’t attack, but that has changed out of the blue.
