","So I went to Assiniboine park yesterday at 12:30 pm with the baby. He napped and i walked around, exercising. I’m walking in the Leo Mol garden then notice someone behind. Turn, it’s just a man. Then I go behind the garden and next to the river. The same man follows me. Starts talking to me, about my baby and how he has an 11 year old and how kids are great. I’m like yep (please don’t murder me). He could definitely beat me up. He talks about the weather, then asks me if I’m Ukrainian. Then tells me I look intelligent. After a few minutes the road splits and he asks if he could invite me for a cup of coffee. I’m like no thank you. He’s like you sure? I smile, say I’m sure and have a good day.

Honestly, I felt very scared and uncomfortable the whole time. But I kept telling myself it’s just a man wanting to ask a woman out, he was nice and respected the no. But then I sent the message to a group chat with other moms and they said they had a similar experience with what sounds like the same man. Apparently he approached the group of them and wanted to see their babies. 

Taller white man, mid to late 40s. Has a truck and talks about his 11 year old. Anyone else experience something like this?",74,1730225584.0,Winnipeg,19,0.84,False
