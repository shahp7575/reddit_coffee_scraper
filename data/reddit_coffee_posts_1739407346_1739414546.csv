Barely see each other barely talked up until recently, Had break together a couple weeks ago and struck up a nice little conversation about how we are both going through a break up and I casually mentioned that my ex-girlfriend had moved out and I've been left on my own paying for everything the past few months. So she knows that I am gay. After that shift, I see her again the next day she walks into work and I see her looking at me up and down a little bit with the biggest smile on her face and says hi. My boss was teasing me wondering what is going on because she is usually so quiet, but she's very chatty with me. She works at a coffee shop near me so I stopped by there a few days ago and she was so happy to see me in her face lit up. We were talking nonstop eye contact, even as I was driving off, we were looking at each other and smiling. We talk a little bit on social media and l even gave her my phone number. This was about five days ago and I haven't heard anything yet. We worked together today and once again, super communication, vibung, telling me her life goals, we work in the beauty industry, and I gave her a sample of something and I said not that you need it because you're already beautiful and she turned red and giggled and blushed. We seem like we have the same values and I'm definitely interested in her. But I just don't know if she's interested in me. She did have a boyfriend most recently who she was dating. They are now broken up. But just her whole vibe and the way she dresses, The career she's getting into is very male dominated grew up in sports and literally any of my coworkers that don't know much about her think that she is gay as well so l'm just a little bit confused. Again, we never had anything to do with each other until she found out that I was a lesbian and now the communication is increasing and I just wanna ask her out so bad but I don't want to be offputting especially since we work together even though my work is super lenient we wouldn't get in trouble or anything, but I just don't want it to be awkward please help me figure this girl out üôèüôåüèªüôÉ",2,1739414122.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

It then came back a little bit around 10 but dissapeared when I was ready to eat again. I then waited for my hunger to come back and I FINALLY ate at 12pm ( mind you, I am a BIG breakfast person, I am always hungry in the morning so this was unusal that my first meal is that late). 

I then ate an orange, 2 rice cake with pb and like maybe 1/3 cup greek yogurt with like a handful of berries, 3 halves of walnut and some honey. I then didn't get hungry until bedtime. I went to bed and couldn't fall asleep and was thinking about food but it didn't ""excite"" me like normal when I am hungry. I decided to then go try to eat, I ate some cucumber, half an avocado with a small piece of salmon, a fiber one brownie and a kashi bar. Nothing else seemed appetizing. I then felt satisfied and went to bed and NOW I feel like I can fall alseep. 

Is this normal? Does hunger ever dissapear even tho we NEED to eat? Like clearly, I think I needed to eat before bed because I couldn't fall alseep no matter how hard I tried. Now I feel like I will sleep like a baby.

Learned a ton about eating. Specifically calorie density, macros like protein and effects of micronutrients like excess sodium. 

Learmed to cook. Cooking meals at home helped me focus on eating whole ingredients, healthy veggies and lean meats, and more control over my diet. Reduced fast food from 3-4 times a week to 1-2 a month. Having consistent go to recipes you make at home is a must. 

Learned a lot about my body and exercise. Started with 1 hr daily walking @ 3.5 mph from 240 to 220. Changed it up to 1 hr jogging at 4.5 mph. with 30 mins kettlebell. Kept that up until 200 lbs. From 200-180 focused on running 30 min 5k and 15 min rowing, 10 mins calisthenics/dip bar. Big focus on cardio and more reps on strength. Looking to focus on calisthenics for strength now.

They go through the caffeine withdrawal symptoms but they have no idea that not receiving the caffeine from their coffee was the cause of the symptoms. Would those symptoms be lessened by the person being unaware of what was causing them to feel bad?

1io8i1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1io8i1r/why_bodum_pour_over_coffee_maker_is_among_the/,Why Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker is Among the Best Pour Over Coffee Makers: A Detailed Review,"Testing the Bodum 11571-109US Pour Over Coffee Maker has been a delightful journey for someone who treasures a good cup of coffee. As a coffee enthusiast, I‚Äôve tried many brewing methods over the years, from French presses to drip machines, and pour-over brewing has always held a special place in my heart. This particular coffee maker, with its high-heat borosilicate glass carafe and reusable stainless steel filter, brings sophistication and practicality to your countertop.

Pour-over brewing, as I‚Äôve discovered with this product, creates a robust, flavorful cup that retains the coffee's natural oils. The design of this pour-over coffee maker is both elegant and functional, with the cork grip adding a charming touch while also protecting your hands from heat. The cork band, combined with the durable glass body, makes it a standout piece in any kitchen. I‚Äôve used it daily to make my morning cup, and the process is as enjoyable as the result.

The stainless steel filter is a game-changer. Unlike paper filters that absorb aromatic oils, this one preserves them, resulting in a richer taste. However, cleaning the filter thoroughly is crucial to avoid leftover grounds affecting subsequent brews. The glass carafe is heat-resistant, a feature I tested by accidentally pouring boiling water too quickly into it‚Äîthankfully, no cracks or damage occurred.

[Click here to find Bodum 11571-109US on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/product-reviews/best-pour-over-coffee-maker-bodum-11571-109us-review-b07kqvw6rr/)

Using the Bodum pour-over coffee maker is incredibly simple. Start by adding coarse-ground coffee to the filter, pour a small amount of heated water in a circular motion to let the grounds ""bloom,"" and then continue pouring the remaining water slowly. Watching the coffee drip into the carafe is almost meditative, and within minutes, you have a perfectly brewed cup. The 34-ounce capacity is ideal for serving two to three people, making it a go-to for small gatherings or a quiet morning at home.

**Pros**

* The reusable stainless steel filter eliminates the need for paper filters, making this an eco-friendly option.
* The borosilicate glass carafe is both durable and aesthetically pleasing.
* Cork grip not only adds style but also provides heat insulation, making it easy to handle.
* Produces rich, aromatic coffee with preserved natural oils.
* Dishwasher-safe components make cleaning a breeze.

**Cons**

* Fine coffee grounds can sometimes seep through the filter, resulting in a slightly gritty cup if not brewed carefully.
* The cork band, while stylish, can be tricky to remove and reattach for cleaning.
* Requires a bit of a learning curve to master the pouring technique for optimal flavor.
* The glass carafe, though sturdy, can still be fragile if mishandled.
* Coffee cools quickly due to the single-wall design, necessitating immediate drinking or transferring to a thermal carafe.

**Comparison to Competitors** Compared to other pour-over makers like the Chemex or the Hario V60, the Bodum stands out for its built-in reusable filter. Chemex, while highly reputed, requires paper filters, which can be cumbersome and less eco-friendly. On the other hand, the Hario V60 offers similar functionality but lacks the aesthetic appeal of the cork band and borosilicate glass design. However, the Hario V60 does allow for finer control over brewing due to its cone shape and specific pour-over technique.

Another popular contender, the Kalita Wave, is known for its flat-bottom design, which ensures even extraction. Still, it doesn‚Äôt match the Bodum's simplicity and ease of use, especially for beginners. The Bodum is less intimidating, making it a great starting point for those new to the pour-over method. While each has its merits, the Bodum strikes a satisfying balance between design, usability, and performance.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** For its price point, the Bodum 11571-109US offers excellent value. The reusable filter alone saves money over time compared to models requiring disposable paper filters. Its durability and attractive design make it a worthwhile investment for both casual coffee drinkers and aficionados. While premium options like the Chemex may appeal to purists, the Bodum provides nearly the same quality with added convenience and eco-friendliness.

That said, if you're on a budget and looking to explore pour-over brewing without breaking the bank, this coffee maker makes a compelling case. The cost is justified by its long-term usability and the quality of coffee it produces. The minor drawbacks, such as the need for careful cleaning and the potential for slight grit in the coffee, are manageable with proper technique and care.

I really like this girl I am dating. She says really cute things to me, seems super into me, she likes to plan dates, and we generally get along very well. She told me a couple weeks into dating that she was busu during Valentine's day because her out of state female friend was visiting. I told her it was no problem and that we'd celebrate over the weekend after he friend has left. Over the next week she told me all the fun things she was going to do with her friend. We live like 5 minutes from Philadelphia and she is a huge Eagles fan. When they won the superbowl she asked me if I wanted to go to the city at 10:30PM with her and her friends to celebrate, I turned it down because it was late and I had work the next day, which is no big deal. But I told her if she wanted I'd go to the parade with her. The Parade is now this coming Friday, but her friend is still over, which of course I knew she was. She bought be tickets to get into Philly ahead of the parade (they're like $6) so it seems like she wants me to go, and I do to.

  
I just feel like its going to be awkward since I've never met this other friend of hers before. She's been so busy with her friend we've barely even spoke this week beside small stuff.

Context: 
I honestly think she was at least some level interested in me because when we spoke for the first time in real life she said she recognised me from instagram and that she finds me really funny and that I should take it as a compliment.

She hadn‚Äôt shown up for the week I went into the library which racked me up a huge bill in Matcha. Hence why I decided doing this valentines thing was the best thing to do.

‚ÄúDear ___,

Please show up at [library] again because I‚Äôve been trying to get you Matcha for the past week and you haven‚Äôt been there. The baristas know me now - better or for worse. At least I‚Äôve been studying a lot more now.

On my way home via Grab I heard 5 songs that would always remind me of Exes. To be honest, Wala akong binalikan at Wala akong babalikan. I found myself singing along with feelings.  Happy Valentines Day nga pala bukas-Walang mag va-valentines sa pamilyang ito ang peg. 


Celebrated Valentines once and never again after. Kaya gigil ako sa Valentines. True di lahat ng memory pwedeng ma-overide o mabago. So this year I'm still stuck with that memory. Days before valentines I was pestering him like ano plan or will I see him or something. All he could say was ""eto na yun"". Take note sinundo niya ako sa school with our bestie. So ending lakad Ng tropa. I was gonna be a bitch about it pero what can I do? We were both in college and my parents hated him (oo bad influence Siya pero ako naman nagdedecide if I wanna play hooky or party). Valentines day came..my parents dropped me to school and I was friggin getting upset. No calls or messages from that guy. I called our bestie to see if they were playing some stupid game (like they always do) and all bestie could say was ""nope, pero billiards and inom kame later. Boys night so wag ka na umasa"". That really ticked me off. So I went straight to the smoking area. Di naman ako naka uniform that day so to hell na lang if makita ako ng mga prof. As soon as took my ciggy out someone with an out stretched hand with a lighter said ""hi miss! Needa light?"" I looked up and that ungas was smiling like crazy with a dozen pink Ecuadorian roses on the other hand. I was blushing like crazy and I didn't know if I was gonna be happy or mad. All I could do was throw a light punch and told him how mean he was for making me feel bad. Onga naman.. may surprise ba na sinasabi? Siyempre Wala. Went back to class and signed the attendance record and played hooky. We had lunch in Italiannis, billiards, and coffee, and drove me home. He gave me a bracelet and this burned CD in a shape of a rose it had Tamia and Eric Benet's Spend my life with you. If I could forget this I would. Does it make me smile? No. Does it make me angry? No. I don't feel anything remembering it. But I hate it. I don't want to be stuck with that memory. 


Hey ex... I know you're here and you'll be able to read this. Thank you but I do wish I can forget this. Like this memory you belong somewhere in oblivion...I don't like it at all.

Detailed review inside!,"I have spent weeks using the Basecent BC021 milk frother, and it‚Äôs been quite the journey. As someone who appreciates a frothy cappuccino in the morning, this small handheld device had my attention right from the start. Compact, battery-operated, and with a stainless steel body, it seemed to check all the boxes for convenience and durability. But, of course, no product is flawless, and this one is no exception. Let me walk you through the highs and lows of my experience.

The first thing I noticed was how lightweight it is‚Äîjust 10.8 ounces. This makes it incredibly easy to handle, even for my teenage niece, who eagerly jumped in to try it out. The build feels solid, thanks to the food-grade stainless steel construction. The detachable whisk design is a standout feature; cleaning it is as simple as running it under warm water. The accompanying 12 oz pitcher is a thoughtful addition, perfect for frothing milk or even mixing hot chocolate. My six-year-old nephew was thrilled to use it for his chocolate milk, declaring it the ""coolest gadget ever.""

The frother is powered by three AAA batteries, and while I love the cordless feature, the downside is that it doesn‚Äôt come with batteries included. Be prepared to stock up if you don‚Äôt already have some at home. Once powered, it operates with a simple push of a button located at the top. The motor churns at an impressive speed of 21,000 RPM, and let me tell you, it whips up foam in as little as 12 seconds. Whether you‚Äôre using whole milk, almond milk, or oat milk, the results are consistent‚Äîlight, creamy froth that rivals what you‚Äôd get at a coffee shop.

[Check Basecent BC021 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-milk-frother-basecent-bc021-review-b07l7215d1/)

On the flip side, the battery compartment can be a bit finicky. After a month of use, I noticed some rusting inside the compartment, likely due to accidental exposure to water while cleaning. This is a common complaint among users, and it‚Äôs worth noting that even the most careful cleaning routine might not completely avoid this issue. Another hiccup is that the frother doesn‚Äôt come with multiple speed settings‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one, which might not suit everyone‚Äôs needs.

I also tested this frother as a small blender for cocktails and protein shakes. While it‚Äôs effective, mixing thicker ingredients like protein powder sometimes takes longer than expected. Still, it‚Äôs a handy tool for more than just frothing milk, which adds to its versatility.

**Pros**

* Lightweight and portable, making it great for travel.
* Creates creamy, airy froth in seconds, even with non-dairy milk.
* Durable stainless steel design with an easy-to-clean detachable whisk.
* Versatile; works with hot chocolate, cocktails, and even egg beating.
* Comes with a handy 12 oz pitcher for a seamless frothing experience.

**Cons**

* Battery compartment prone to rusting if not handled carefully.
* Operates only at one speed, limiting customization.
* Batteries not included, requiring an extra purchase.
* Struggles slightly with thicker mixtures like protein shakes.
* Some users report durability issues over long-term use.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When stacked against similar products like the Zulay Original Milk Frother or the IKEA Milk Frother, the Basecent BC021 stands out for its speed and power. The Zulay frother is comparable in build quality but operates at a slightly lower RPM, which means it takes a few more seconds to achieve the same frothiness. On the other hand, the IKEA frother is a more budget-friendly option but feels less sturdy and doesn‚Äôt come with any additional accessories like a pitcher.

The Basecent BC021 also competes well with electric frothers like the Nespresso Aeroccino. While the Aeroccino offers more advanced features, such as temperature control and automatic operation, it comes at a significantly higher price point. If you‚Äôre looking for something affordable and portable, the Basecent BC021 is a solid choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of value, this milk frother is priced competitively for what it offers. The included pitcher adds significant value, as standalone pitchers of this quality often cost nearly as much as the frother itself. While the lack of multiple speed settings and the potential for rusting are drawbacks, the overall performance justifies the investment, especially for casual users or coffee enthusiasts on a budget.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely, with some caveats. If you‚Äôre meticulous about cleaning and don‚Äôt mind replacing the occasional battery, this frother can elevate your at-home coffee game without breaking the bank. Its versatility and quick operation make it a great addition to any kitchen, travel bag, or office.

We start off amped and determined, then somewhere between the 10th cup of coffee and our hundredth distraction, we‚Äôre wondering, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what was I doing?‚Äù

I‚Äôve totally been there. I used to get so lost in the day-to-day grind‚Äîmeetings, errands, the occasional TikTok spree‚Äîthat I‚Äôd almost forget my main mission. Sound familiar?

Here‚Äôs what helped me get back on track:

1. **Write down that ‚Äòbig why.‚Äô** You know, the reason you started chasing your goal in the first place. Put it on a sticky note, your phone wallpaper, or anywhere you‚Äôll see it daily.
2. **Break it into bite-sized steps.** Instead of ‚ÄúMust become fitness guru,‚Äù try ‚ÄúGo for a 20-minute walk.‚Äù Smaller tasks feel way less intimidating (and you‚Äôre less likely to bail).
3. **Celebrate micro-victories.** Sold your first piece of art? High-five yourself. Nailed a tricky workout routine? Treat yourself to some fancy coffee. Small rewards keep the motivation rolling.
4. **Remind yourself it‚Äôs a marathon.** Yeah, that sprint might be exhilarating‚Äîbut the real win is sustainable progress, not burnout.

It‚Äôs crazy how just remembering your reason for starting can re-ignite that spark. Sometimes all we need is that little mental nudge to say, ‚ÄúOh right, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pushing so hard!‚Äù

Anyone else have a method that keeps them from wandering off into the motivational wilderness? Because I‚Äôve definitely spent some time there... and I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm not the only one.",1,1739412237.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I am starting this profile as a way to explore my favorite kinks; breeding (pinning you down, filling you up), impregnation (after successful breeding), pregnancy (your belly swelling with my babies), birth (let's face it, kinda hot right?), and lactation (look, if I'm going to swell it all up I'm gonna benefit from putting your milk in my coffee okay?  Okay.).  

I am a 40 year old white guy who is pretty fit but is developing some dad bod, because age is a bitch like that but I'm told the girls like it.  I shave my head, have a big beard, and I'm a bit on the hairy side.  Dark hair, brown eyes, average height.  

I'm really active.  I like going to the gym (though admittedly I don't like public gyms because gym bros just aren't my style), but I prefer to get my exercise outdoors on the trail.  I got tired of running awhile ago, but a good hard hike is always a good distraction.  

Speaking of hikes, I love the outdoors and nature.  Being outside is my favorite thing.  I am an excellent farmer and gardener, and have quite the green thumb.  I suppose I'm just talented making all things grow.  

While I can't divulge what my job is (makes me sound cooler than it really is), I will say I get to do a lot of awesome stuff outdoors and get paid decently to do it.  It helps being handy enough to build things, fox cars, and so most of my own work myself. 

I'm sure you hear all this and think I'm the manliest man to ever man, but I'm also a huge nerd.  That's right. Need a guy who will fix your car and then DM your DND session before fucking triplets into you?  Look no further girl, I've got what you need.  I know my way around D20.  As an added bonus, I have an affinity for all sorts of boards games and nerd culture, horror movies, heavy metal, and books.  So many god damn books.  You're not going to know what the hell to do with me. 

I'm pretty kinky!  While I've already listed my go-tos, I'm pretty fluent in basic / light domination and subbing.  You subbing of course, I'm the boss in the bedroom..  All you have to do is show up and have lots of orgasm and get / be pregnant.  I can be pretty rough, if that is what you want.  I'm also open to trying new things usually, but bathroom functions and generally gross stuff like that is off the table.  

Ladies, like what you're reading?  I hope to hear from you.  I would love to have some conversations about our shared kink, or even maybe more. ;)",1,1739411595.0,u_Swollen_Belly_Dreams,0,1.0,False

She grabs my hair, conflicted on how to feel.

I tell her all the colors we have had and she giggles.

I asked her about our friends and she beamed about how much she loved them.

I could not bear to tell her we haven't talked in years, i barely remember their faces. 

She asks what church we go to.

I am silent. I don't know what to say.

I eventually tell her none and her smile drops. Our love for God died with our innocence. 

To cheer her up I tell her about our partner and friends. The activities and future we have made.

There is a weird moral dilemma when you have coffee with your younger self. Do i tell her of the horrors and realizations we come to as we age? Or do i respect the innocence that she is grasping to?

I grab the hands of younger me. I tell her it's time to go home now. I beg her to play with her sister. To run, cry and pray. To live her childhood fully.

I am slowly starting to notice a sort of aggression in my workouts. I'll be honest with you all. I haven't had a problem with discipline in years. I don't drink, smoke, never have, never will. I also don't watch television or movies. The only thing I was ever addicted to was porn. Even when I was a frequent fapper I was pretty disciplined. I work in a department where I am pretty much unsupervised as long as I do what I have to do. This lead to me using the 8 hours a day, unsupervised to become a self-taught web developer and designer over the course of two years. My company is garbage with a high turn over rate so this further justified me using the time to build what I wanted to build.

This excites me very much because I know this is only the beginning. Once I become better at my skill my pay will increase. He also gave me permission to use what ever work I do for him to build my portfolio site and make a part of my case studies.

All names are fake.

I'm male, was about 20 or 21 when this happened. I had a best friend Jess, female, a couple years older than me. We had been friends since I was 16.

An acquaintance of mine Emma reached out to me one day and asked if we could grab coffee. Emma confided in me that she was pregnant, and the father had jumped ship. She was scared and didn't know what to do.  
After our talk, she said she had something to tell me about my friend Jess. She said she wouldn't tell me unless I promised to keep her completely anonymous. I asked why, she said that she had nothing to do with the situation, she simply heard about it from a friend at Jess‚Äô workplace, and didn't want any drama with Jess, especially now. Jess had a reputation of being very intense.

I promised to keep her anonymous.

Emma told me that Jess had made some enemies at her job, and someone found Jess' phone unlocked in the break-room and stole photos of Jess from it, and was threatening Jess with them.

Later that day I sent Jess a message telling her I was sorry to hear what happened, and that I was there if she needed anything.

She immediately responded saying ""what the fuck do you know about it?""

She demanded to know who told me. I assured her they didn't work there, and they had nothing to do with it.

She called me and yelled at me, accusing me of being a part of the conspiracy, accusing me of stealing the photos, and I was purposefully hiding evidence from her.

There was a lot of back and forth, me trying to convince her I had nothing to do with it and neither did my friend, who didn't even work there.

Over text she gave me an ultimatum. Tell her who told me, or she would block me on everything and never speak to me again. She began counting down in the text. 5, 4, 3, etc...

I said something angry, along the lines of, ""If this is how you're going to treat me, maybe we shouldn't be friends.""

She texted ""Bye bye.""

And that's the last I'd ever see or hear from her ever again.

I've come to terms with it now, but still feel hurt and guilt whenever I think about it. I know I would've handled it far differently, and more delicately, today. I was young and ignorant, and didn't fully grasp the gravity of the situation.

I take promises very seriously. I don't make them lightly. If I make a promise, I keep it. Full stop. But part of me wonders if I did the wrong thing. I wanted to protect my friend Emma too. She was in really rough shape about her pregnancy. She was terrified, and I didn't want to sick Jess on her. I knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Emma had nothing to do with it.

It has a 75CC Parker P1 (load sensing) brand new unit. Running an M4 Bosch Rexroth control valve. Closed centre, load sensing, 10GPM motor spool.

I‚Äôm not used to this valve and have never installed one before, typically I stick to the PVG series Danfoss valves. 

I had a flow meter inline with it, and with the meter fully closed the pump ran fine upon actuation from the control valve. Compensated @ 1000 PSI (just as a base number my running pressure will be higher) BUT as soon as I open up the flow meter and allow oil to pass through this thing surges like its had 50 to many cups of coffee. I‚Äôve never seen anything like this. 

What I‚Äôm thinking is the control valve is receiving too much oil from the pump and the LS line is getting an impulse from it, OR the CV has a ‚ÄúY‚Äù port directly to tank, I have it going through a return manifold with my case drain from the pump and the CV return line. Is there a possibility the return pressure is back feeding through the drain port and causing this issue? Would an orifice in the LS line stop the surging? The pump does not have a volume stop so that isn‚Äôt an option, unless there‚Äôs a kit for the P1 (there‚Äôs plugged holes in the end cover where one would normally be)

i‚Äôm 21 nb, and my relationship with my dad (43) has basically exploded since new years eve. 

just for context purposes, i‚Äôll give a little backstory first: 
in 2021, when i was 18, my parents announced they were getting a divorce due to reasons i won‚Äôt get into in this post, but know that my mom (42) and i weren‚Äôt on speaking terms for almost a year, but have since reconnected and are closer than ever. this is relevant for reasons. In the immediate aftermath of their split, i took on the caretaker role in the house with my mom‚Äôs absence, being the people pleaser i am. i made my dad‚Äôs bed, cleaned his very messy room, made sure his coffee was all but done brewing as soon as he walked in the door, and made dinner as often as i could. 
(note: my mom did not abandon us, my siblings stayed with her on and off while i stayed with dad full time) 
my dad and i got extremely close during this time, and i‚Äôd often refer to him as my favorite person or one of my best friends, because he really, really was. we‚Äôd stay up late and watch movies together, smoke until it was basically coming out of our ears, and just enjoy the time we had to bond. that time truly does take up a lot of my happier memories of post-covid life, so it makes this shitshow a lot more devastating for me. 

i think the problems started around late 2022. i‚Äôd long since mended my relationship with my mom, and dad had no problem with that. he always encouraged us to keep in contact with her, and the two of them had a semi-friendship building up. as much of a friendship as you can have with your ex of almost 25 years i guess lol. 
dad started working a lot more, coming home exhausted and often falling asleep in his car at the end of the driveway. whenever we did get to hang out, sometimes he‚Äôd be passive aggressive, saying things like: ‚Äúthe sink‚Äôs full of dishes‚Äù ‚Äúyou could‚Äôve (done this thing)‚Äù ‚Äúthis house is always a fucking mess‚Äù. my dad is a hoarder, and that was one of many reasons my mom had to leave, my siblings and i just never really saw how bad it was until she wasn‚Äôt there to keep up with the house. i‚Äôll admit in my own depression, i wasn‚Äôt doing much to keep up with the messes in the house, but my siblings hardly ever helped and any cleaning from dad would be late-night rage cleaning when one room got too messy. 
another thing about my dad is that he never listens, he‚Äôs got one hell of a victim complex, and he‚Äôs extremely stubborn. all of those traits mixed together formed his favorite sentence: ‚Äúi‚Äôm just a dickhead‚Äù, thrown at us anytime we‚Äôd call out his behavior. 
skip ahead to October 2023, and my grandmother (dad‚Äôs mom) passed away in a tragic accident. from what we know, an exposed wire in the attic sparked, and the house burned down with her in it. my dad had been working in the garage and fell asleep, waking up to the smell of smoke and unable to get into the house. he was devastated, and to this day he blames himself, though none of us would ever blame him for that. 
after her death, and tbh i think a little bit before, my dad started using meth. i didn‚Äôt know he was using for a while, but my siblings and i had all started suspecting something was up when his behavior got more aggressive and negative. his mood dictated the mood of the whole house, and most days we thought it was better to just avoid him as to not deal with his constant negative energy. the meth issue is also a post of its own, but idk if i want to get into it more than i need to. 
fast forward, december 2024. dads hoarding is out of control at this point. there‚Äôs a path from the doorway to the kitchen, and limited space in the living room. you basically had to do parkour to get anywhere, and all the furniture stinked like dirty dogs. and for some reason, my dad thought it was a good idea to invite a friend of his (28F) to live with us as she was facing homelessness. sure, she needed a place to stay, that‚Äôs fine, right? it would‚Äôve been if he had asked me, or anyone, how i felt about it or given any notice. after christmas, kayla (fake name) moved in, and we got along pretty well. she was a very nice girl facing a tough situation, and personally I don‚Äôt think she was any happier about staying with us than I was. any time I brought this up to dad, he‚Äôd get defensive. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for helping someone‚Äù was the defense he‚Äôd use every time, never seeming to grasp how bizarre it is to come home to a random girl sleeping on your couch. whatever, my own feelings get disregarded again, not anything new at this point. I go to my mom‚Äôs to celebrate new years, mom & dad get into an argument over text about kayla, and she tells him he‚Äôs not welcome to come over for new years. this leads to him angrily texting me for talking to my mom about kayla living with us, and me, tired of his bullshit, angrily texting him back. a lot of things were said back and forth, i unloaded a lot of what I‚Äôve been feeling on him, and two days into 2025, i‚Äôm taking my cats and moving out. i‚Äôm keeping it vague because a lot of what was said is too much for me to confront right now, but know that my dad said things that I deem unforgivable. 
since then, we‚Äôve had minimal contact. we‚Äôve texted back and forth a few times but have only talked in person once, where he gave somewhat of an apology but reiterated that it was MY choice to leave, that he doesn‚Äôt disown his kids, blah blah blah. i‚Äôm angry, i‚Äôm hurt, and i just typed out a message detailing all of what I need him to do for us to have a relationship moving forward. it‚Äôs not even half of what i truly want to say, but i hope it‚Äôs enough to get my point across. i don‚Äôt think my dad realizes the gravity of what he‚Äôs done to our relationship because he‚Äôs too stupid to see his actions and their effect on his loved ones. but i need him to understand, i need my dad back. 

i‚Äôm sorry that this became such a rant. i‚Äôm not sure what i hope to get out of making this post, i just need to vent before i text him. i‚Äôm not sure when i‚Äôll send the message, but when i do.. whatever happens after will make or break our relationship, and it will be his decision.

1io7m2m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1io7m2m,Big Update,"Feb 10: Russelville 
Left the library after my latest story. Was extremely hungry, but didn't want to hop in IGA‚Äôs dumpster like I forgot to mention had happened 2 days prior.

Backstory: Feb 8
I saw watermelon and tubs of fresh berries just sitting there.
Was practically upside down trying to reach the food. Wasn't paying attention and it was broad daylight. Nobody was guarding the dumpster so I went for it. Wasn't 30 seconds inverted, when I heard ‚Äúexcuse me.‚Äù 
I ignored it, until she said it again, louder this time.
Her and her coworker scowled at how I, a homeless and worthless - vagrant, could do something so appalling as to eat perfectly good food that they were throwing away by the hundreds daily.
Told me it was, ‚Äúillegal‚Äù and ‚ÄúI should be ashamed of myself.‚Äù

I asked em both but could I eat the wilted bell pepper and bowl of berries anyways? They didn't tell me no. I waltzed off with my score.
Didn't make it 20 feet and she yelled ‚Äúwait! I have something for you.‚Äù I remember thinking great, Karen trying to stall me so the cops can show up in time.

Brought me out 3 bags of tiny chips. You know the small Subway size bags they charge you 3 left testicles and a monkey paw for these days. Yeah, those.
Great, thanks. Yall practically just got done dehumanizing me and now you're giving me a peace offering of chips, when you could've let me alone to eat the watermelon slices yall threw out.
Anyways, I ate my score. Threw away her peace offering (principle of the thing).

I might be homeless but I know I'm worthwhile, and nobody can ever take that away from me. So that's the story, I scored what I got, and kept my self respect. A lady saw me with my head down and gave me a mountain dew and $5. 
Take that, IGA! Corporate scumbags that waste food people could eat.


Feb 10 (continued)
Waltzed the town. Sun going down. Rain was on the way. I had been to the food bank prior, a place called the ‚ÄúJesus center‚Äù by locals and explained that I was a traveler, homeless by choice. I didn't need their work program. 

Stopped at the local family dollar. Bought 5 pack of ramen. Dropped off food at the blessing box I got from the food bank and didn't want.
Got accosted by two Mormon missionaries. One said that his book would fill me with God's spirit.
All I said was ‚ÄúI can't eat that.‚Äù which made em laugh. 

I'm sorry man, but the denomination wars ain't my game. I'm hungry, and something about golden plates or something ain't gonna change it. They wanted to meet me the same place they found me the next day.
I told em I go when God presents me an opportunity, I'm on his time. It's wherever he would call me. So, if I bounce out tonight I might not be here tomorrow. Looking back, sorry guys.

The Jesus center had set me up with pouches of chicken among other things. I was hopeful to make a warm meal from the things I had scrounged. 
Black beans from the blessing box near the jail, chicken pouch, and some ramen with hot sauce. 
Just needed hot water.

I walked to several gas stations, asking. ‚ÄúNo, no hot water.‚Äù some looked at me like I had 3 heads.
Man, times have changed. Five-star tried to charge me $1.36 for a cup.
Just wanted to cook my ramen. Fuck it. I sat down and ate my food outside the Jesus center, ice cold.

Whittled the bean can open with my pocket knife, and fetched me a spoon.
I stirred the hot truffle sauce in with the chicken. To simulate heat at least. Meal was actually good, and I thanked God/universe for that shit right there and then. Thank you, I'm grateful for everything I've been given.
Seriously.

To exist is a gift, and I spend so much time feeling like a victim, that I forget to see the bigger picture.
Anyways that meal was bomb. Smoked. Threw the trash where it went - the trash can. Stopped by the local handout box from ‚Äúcommunity action‚Äù. Rudest people I've ever met. 

As expected, they took everything inside because they saw me get a coffee out of their free box. Whatever. 
Checked their dumpster, scored a north face blue hoody the bastards had tossed for a tax write off. Neighbors peeking out their windows watching me dig in the dumpster. I got what I got. Time to bounce before the cops come.

Time to go bed down, before the rain set in. I pissed around instead. Sat behind a dumpster, rolled a smoke. Thought about shit, missed my son. Remembered the abuse I suffered at her hands. Nam flashbacks. Time to stop. Smoked to ease the panic attack. 

Walked all the way to bed in the same place, and remembered I'd be breaking my own rule doing that. Had a bad gut feeling. 
Some lady randomly stopped and kicked down a $10. I thanked her.
Sat outside the Golden savior of vagabonds - the dollar store. 

Rolled a smoke. Drank an Arizona tea. Stared back at all the gawking mofos that always seem to be staring but never help me. Fuck yall. 

Sure enough, cops left and right. They must've caught wind. Not breaking my own rule. Time to walk the 2 miles to the Walmart woods, back the opposite way. Not sleeping in the same spot two nights in a row, no sir.

And then, the pitter patter began. Son of a bitch. I can't get wet it's 30 degrees, I'll die of hypothermia. 40 minute walk in this sleet like rain. 

I went back to the Jesus center, remembered their gazebo, and curled up in the lazy chair amidst the furniture they had piled. I drifted off using my bedroll to block the view of the street. Saw a dude walk right by me and he never even saw me.

Bandana on my face and hood pulled down to hide my milk white skin. Used my improvised great kilt as a blanket. Dozed off. Rain came down all night, I tossed and turned. Legs aching me from sitting on them all night.


Feb 11 - Elkton
But yknow what though, I was dry. Dry and warm - enough. Bounced out at 5:45am. Rolled a smoke, sat there thinking bout what needed to be done, and bounced in the morning rain.

I got soaked. Kilt didn't want to stay on up under the poncho. Got turned around twice in the cold dark. Where tf Casey's was at this point i didn't fucking know. Dipped in between two abandoned houses, pissed. 

Just about made it to Casey's, dude stops asking if I needed a ride. Told him unless he was going to Elkton, I had found where I was going.
He told me he could do it, he just needed to take his car home and get his other one. I just needed to go on to Caseys.
Uh huh. Sure. Alright buddy, thank you for your help.

I went into Casey's thinking this dude might very just have a hard time saying no and didn't want to drive me there so he made up that whole speel. 

I hate being so cynical, but life on the streets and being done dirty too many times makes you that way.

Went into get my coffee. Tried to play it cool and not seem nervous around the cutie behind the counter. I love me some black girls, man. 
Tried to play it cool, fumbled though. Spilled some of my coffee. She didn't seem to mind. 
Stepped outside, and there he was. The man I didn't want to get my hopes up for!

Drove me in the pouring down rain to Elkton.
We talked about relationships.  Talked about God. Smoked a cigarette he offered with my morning coffee. Marlboro black? I'll take it. Not great, but nice throat hit.

He dropped me off at the BP, swore they had wifi. I asked for the library, but he wanted me to be dry and warm. He drives off, I check my phone - no wifi.
I did it the old fashioned way. Walked business to business getting more than one opinion about which way the library was. 
Usually I ask 3 people, and it's 2 out of 3 and their opinion I follow. 
Came up with that to weed out the people wanting to send me to bad parts of town, long ago when I was a street smart kid.

Sat outside the library which I'm at now as I write this. A kid talked to me, kid told his mom I needed pants. Everyone thinks my kilt looks cold I guess.
She came back, brought me food and mountain dew, a green fleece blanket (my new kilt?) And some jogging pants.
I thanked her, and when the boy mentioned something about him being a ginger I told him to take pride in who he is. 
We Irish/Scottish people have been through a lot historically. We are fighters, survivors,  and warriors. He seemed to like that, so did his mom.
She hugged me and left.

Idk how imma keep the bologna cold unless I'm outside too, but it'll be alright.

Librarian bought me lunch from the senior center next door. Gotta go get it at 11:30am. Looked up a food bank, it's right next door. Gonna go check it out after my phone is charged and I eat.

So far, Elkton has received me well. And if I hadn't got turned around twice this morning in the cold, that guy would've never passed me on the street‚Ä¶

Update 12:54pm
Ate at the local senior center. God, a warm meal hit just right. 
Nothing like a good cigarette, a bird bath at the library, and a warm meal to make a man feel ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù again.

Met a couple trustees from the local jail. Gave em smokes, treated them like human beings. Got shown respect back.
By word of mouth, hit up local interfaith center. Got given $40, new warmer clothes, and a coca cola and sausage egg n cheese mcgriddle. Look and feel brand new.
Mentioned Hopkinsville, nobody was heading that way.
Came back to the local library to eat, smoke, and chill. Told em about the ‚ÄúGod provides‚Äù philosophy I live by. 
Had a dude say ‚Äú yeah but sometimes you gotta just ask for help.‚Äù
He ain't wrong. Either way gotta hit up the local maps and see where to bed for the night. Gonna stick by the local library, librarian said they don't close til 7pm.
Rocking this beanie gonna have loss prevention profiling my ass should I go back to walmart. Look like about to slang bread from the track. Ya feel me? In other words I look like a drug dealer lol.

If only I had a scooter.

Update: 6:37pm 
Left the library, unsure of where to bed down. Elkton doesn't have a lot of trees. Carrying all this food I now have from earlier has become quite cumbersome. Look like a constipated chihuahua with every step. Still rainy. Cold. Make it a quarter of a mile and blankets fall out of my tarp. 
Frustrated. Stuff em back in my bag. I got way too much shit, and no toilet to flush it in if you know what I mean.

Suddenly, this red truck pulls up. Pastor from local church. Runs a halfway house. Explains the situation.  I explained mine. A lady from the library called and said there was a new vagrant in town. That I needed help. They said they had a couch I could sleep on.
That they've got two other guys here. I thought about where tf I would sleep on this cold and rainy evening.

Bags were heavy, I was tired. Need to let some stuff go, extra blankets and things but it's not spring yet. I dont feel like lugging this shit tonight. I obliged. Fuck it.
If I die, I die. I hopped in the truck. They took me to this house. Gave me food, a place to shower. A place to wash my clothes.
We talked for a minute, they were both very matter of fact and lacking any sense of yeehaw humor.

Thinking I was about to get butt touched or something. But nah, they said they'd gladly give me a ride to Hopkinsville tomorrow morning. 
Guess I ain't gotta make that 37 mile hike after all. 
They left. I finally made that hot ramen bowl I wanted to, ate until I was nursing the largest food baby I've ever had, and chugged a whole liter of cocaine cola.

Damn, son. Man talk about satisfied. But then I felt as though I didn't know what to do with myself.
I went out and smoked. Having walls around me is strange. All my needs can be met, right here in this box. There's no need to walk 2 miles to pee. No reason to hide my phone light while I'm stealth camping. 
Just sat there thinking, ‚Äúnow, what?‚Äù

I'm doing my laundry now. Want to go to sleep like I usually do as soon as it's dark. Not constricted by 20 layers of shirts I dug from the trash, just comfortably sitting on a couch writing in this journal.
Wow, I even got to film a YouTube video for my channel. What the actual flying figs, man.

I need to take a bird bath. I'm not comfortable with the shower. It makes me feel vulnerable. I can't explain it. It's like using a sink feels natural now.

I wish I could live like this for free, being housed. But every time I've tried to settle in this life, and start a family, it goes horribly wrong. 
One tragedy after another befalls me. It's like I was born for the road.
Mom, dad, the love of my life - and now my son.
Stripped from my grasp like sand between my fingers.
Gone with time, only to exist in my memory.
At least there, I will always have my Jennie. 
Tucked away with an unrequited love, in my heart.

I'll love her, for th rest of my life. Not a days passes that I don't remember her. She was my girl. We planned the world together, a life of growing old.
But she married a gypsy, and I married a homebody. Like flame to gasoline, our love burned hot with our hearts and the heat of our passion raged on.

7 years. Though I had seen my whole life with her, I was blessed with 7 years. And for those years of my life; I was the happiest a man could've been.

And though I drift down these back roads with a black hole in my chest that used to hold a soul; 
I hope to die with the memory of her beautiful face as the last thing my mind ever sees.

And with that, tomorrow I head to Hopkinsville. The show must go on, my love.

Small Hiatal hernia. Unexplained difficulty urinating (stream stops, must really concentrate to empty bladder) evaluated by urologist,  including scope and Ultrasound with the only finding being a cyst on kidney which was deemed insignificant. Suggested pelvic floor PT (haven't started that yet). Gallbladder removed in 2009. Last colonoscopy march 2022.

In September I started to experience right sided upper abdominal pain. Very high up, right along the base of the rib line - roughly below my nipple (so not midline, but to be clear, not in breast area, just trying to describe its not on my far side and its not below my sternum either). It was mild, but fairly constant. Had a CT scan of abdomen with and without contrast, ordered by GP. Then had a virtual visit with gastroenterologist who said there were no significant findings and he suggested it might be musculoskeletal and suggested PT. We actually had a long visit (I did not feel brushed off) where I mentioned my mother passed from colon cancer at 53 and my grandmother had colon cancer at 75 (she survived, but succumbed to skin cancer at 85). He was adamant that I did not need a colonoscopy, due to limited symptoms (pain only) and the fact my last colonoscopy was march 2022. I have had 3 colonoscopies total, starting back in 2009 because of my mom's aggressive colon cancer (so not due to any issues/symptoms). No polyps were found, ever. 

Over the next few months the pain became more infrequent and it became a non issue for me. Until roughly February 1st-ish. The pain has returned but it's worse now and it's evolved in the last 2 weeks - I've also had diarrhea for 2 weeks. Initially it was in the same spot. But after a couple days, it's now migrated a little lower. Half way btw my hip bone and where I felt it Initially. It sometimes radiates way over to the far right side, and a little bit wrapped around to the back area, but just slightly. Most days I do have mid-lower back pain too, but it's hard to say if it's connected bc I have had that pain come and go as I've gotten older. The diarrhea is usually in the morning, but occasionally other times. This morning I tried not eating breakfast/coffee, but still had diarrhea. It doesn't seem to be connected to eating bc my biggest meal is dinner and I usually don't have diarrhea at night (sometimes but rarely). Sometimes it's very, very watery but most often I'd describe it like mud or shredded wheat lol, sorry maybe tmi. No blood, but certainly a rainbow of every poop color imaginable over the past 2 weeks.  I don't notice any bloating or gas.

The pain feels better when standing, significantly better, sometimes not even present. But once I sit down, it's there. It hurts less when laying down flat, but still hurts. I have less of an appetite for sure, but I'm trying to force myself to eat at regular intervals. I do still feel hungry sometimes, so my appetite isn't completely gone but it's definitely much less.

I'm trying to get another appt with the gastro, but he doesn't have an opening til April. I could go back to my GP, but he already told me in September that I'd need to see a gastro, so I'm not sure what he could do. 

Of course my main concern is cancer. I don't know if I carry the cancer gene, but I have a referral to a geneticist bc mom(colon), grandma (colon, skin), and uncle (lung) all died from cancer.

It's been about half a year already since I've met you. I'm really tired of having to make sure you know I don't hate you or do any emotional upkeep due to my dad.
I'm going through my cancer treatment and I am already struggling with maintaining my old connections. I *cannot* make more at this point.


I've been respectful, kind, patient, and very open to you and my dad about this. I've told you to let me come to you when I want to get to know you. Please do not force me to be affectionate to you. I don't know you! I do not like it when you call me: Honey, sweetie, baby, dearest, angel, or 'my lovely'

Ahh!! *so weird*

You told me you *love* me very shortly after the first time i met you, like I was already your daughter. I already have a mom. And I'm TWENTY THREE! I do not need another mother. Nor parent. My dad is already on thin ice for not being there for me since i was sixteen, but now you're here and I'm going through treatment-- he suddenly wants to be super involved. Which is fine, I did want a stronger relationship with him. but this does not mean I need to make a perfect relationship with his partner.


I'm just so tired. I cannot keep up with all of this. I feel like I'm dying half the time and I just want to curl up in a ball and waste away. I do not want a new person to immediately try taking the place of my closest friends or cousins. It's weird and i do not want to be told I'm wrong for feeling like this.


On the other hand, I still really appreciate you for bringing out the more fatherly side of my dad. He seems to be so much happier with you. This makes me so happy to see, truly!


I do understand family is super important to you, as it is for me. But this is too much too fast. And I need that to be respected. 
I'm totally fine with having coffee and having a relaxed meeting after treatment. 
It hasn't even been a *year* since you MET my dad. 


It's too much. I'm so overwhelmed, and so tired.



Also this is a vent. I'm not looking for advice. I could complain about this all day. Just know that there are some behind the screen events that make this hard to just cut contact. Plus I do still want a relationship with my dad/his new family. ",2,1739409651.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I did fast in the past but did it barebones by not eating breakfast just a small lunch and dinner. Didn't record anything, exercise was mostly walking due to bad back at the time. I did lose weight but sadly I just stopped bc of family issues (all good now). 

RN I do feel healthy-ish, yeah I'm a big boy but it felt easy to fast before since I have a lot of reserves. My plan rn is doing 16:8, replacing lunch with bone broth and a small dinner before 6pm (my cut off time). For exercise I have one of those exercise sand bag kits so I'll be doing a simple work out before walking some laps around the neighborhood (I live in deep south TX so even at 6pm it still feels a bit toasty).

My question, well mostly asking for suggestions about what I'm doing right, wrong, any tips I should know of before starting, do I sip my broth or down it like a cup of coffee? Any advice would be welcomed, cant wait to start posting my progress.

After taking it to Vic roads, it got knocked back for registration for minor detail of not having vin number stamped on chassis, it was stamped on plates.

I had to get it towed home because the mechanic (that did the roadworthy) said he didn‚Äôt have time to look at it, he said to call in a week. I tried calling the mechanic a week or so later and again he told me to call back in two weeks. 

I ended up taking it to a different mechanic and he found it had multiple holes in the radiator and this was the cause of the engine overheating, he told me I needed to get a new engine for it.

To give you some background, I am currently living with my parents. They are lovely people and I know that no matter what, they have my back and vice versa. On New Year's Day, I crashed in the former room of my sister's and slept in the bed where her kids usually sleep when they are over. I never do this, since I have a room of my own in the house, however there is a TV in that room and I ended up watching a movie and falling asleep.  I did not think anything of it until the next morning. 

Downstairs, when I was making a coffee, my mom came down and I said:' Good morning. Did you sleep well?"". She instantly, for lack of a better word, exploded. Her words were something along the lines of: ""What good morning? You slept in that pristine bed all greasy ( I did not shower that day, in her defence, however it is not like I went for a workout). That bed is only for your sister's kids. She called me evil and that she could see it my eyes while she was seething."" The worst part is she spit/tried spitting on me twice.  Something died in me that day. I can't explain, but I saw her in a different light. 

We are still on no speaking terms and I do not know where this is headed. Part of me thinks, I should forget about it and be a bigger person, while the other part of me still thinks there should be boundaries and how much you can tolerate to let others treat you with disrespect. Also, I am speculating that something else might have triggered her lashing out, and while aware, I am struggling with finding that empathy in me when dealing with this situation. We are  avoiding each other at home including eye contact, but we are also adults and I feel I might also be guilty of overreaction by not talking to her for so long.

so this morning i texted him being like ‚Äúhey i hate leaving stuff open ended and weird, i thought u were super cute and cool and i enjoyed learning stuff abt u‚Äù 
it took him almost all day to respond, like 8 hours and he said basically ‚Äú youre really attractive and cool too, i dont think we should meet up again before i leave bc especially bc ur not used to casual dating (positive he means casual sex/hook up) i dont wanna create any attachments that would upset either of us, but id like to see u when i come back‚Äù 
i was happy with this reply honestly, it put to rest all the overthinking i had done about doing/saying something wrong or just him finding me fugly (but why would he kiss me at the end is my thought process idk maybe hes desperate?) 
so i responded essentially with ‚Äúhey we r definitely on the same page, id love to chill again one day bc i find u cool and interesting outside of a relationship or hooking up. idk if ur down to talk as friends but if not, i hope u find wht ur looking for in ur travels and that ur safe and fulfilled by these adventues, and i actually would have loved to hook up (despite not doing so often) and he has since not responded. i really thought i was communicating in a mature way this entire time, i wasnt trying to be overbearing or portray myself as more invested than i should be, maybe i made a mistake in these messages. i really admire human connection, i rlly try to prioritize clear and concise communication its so important to me, but maybe i came off as ‚Äútoo much‚Äù because i saw that he had watched my instagram story (we followed each other the day i sent him my number) and when i clicked on his account he had soft blocked me. so again, he has done the opposite of what hes communicating in a way that makes me feel weird and overly emotional. i truthfully wasnt super interested in him until it got spun into me thinking i had done something wrong. even with the kiss, i wasnt Super into it, his breath smelled kinda bad and he lowk ate my face lol, but once i left i think i started romanticizing him and his interest in me‚Ä¶ like im very much a girl that likes to be yearned for. idk i could just be extremely overdramatic about it, but i just hate the whiplash this has caused as well as all the self doubt. when i met up with him i was in a state of mind that made me feel like the shit and now i like dont wanna meet up with another guy bc i dont like this weird immature shit. im a grown woman at the end of the day and i dont have time for these weird little boy games. 
id love to hear opinions from a community that uses the app consistently (its honestly more of a boredom thing for me) like is this a common occurrence or is it just me? bc i really feel like it got blown out of proportion but idk if it was my fault or not !! also i did end up blocking his number and his instagram, i just dont think its worth risking texting him again when im upset, and i really dont think hes deserving of my energy.

Or do they just not care anymore!!!!!!! 

I bought this mere hours after their end of business on Friday and paid a while $2 above standard shipping so that I wouldn't have to wait for them to finish their robotic coffee and scratch their shiny metal ass. And waited for the package of a Case and skin for a phone, released only the day before the order to ship all the way to my hotel on the Maine/New Hampshire Boarder in a different country from their business, only for it to arrive on Wednesday, a whole 3 business days after ordering, the nerve I hope they read this post.

I love my new Case. I love the fit, finish and quality of the case. I really appreciate how little the case hinders the access to the S Pen, the whole reason I got the S25 Ultra, after my S21 Ultra's 2nd battery was starting to take a massive nosedive.

Ok ‚Äî enough about me. What worked? 

Hack 1: 2 day water fast/ black coffee (zyn: optional). This set the tone. Proved to me that I could hold off hunger. Reshaped my mind to realized I don‚Äôt NEED food, I just wanted it. 

Side note: I made a joke about ‚ÄúO-zyn-pic‚Äù on Instagram. It went kinda viral. Hilarious (https://nypost.com/2024/05/18/health/affordable-ozempic-dupe-costs-just-5-at-your-local-gas-station/)

I started tracking everything for accountability. I used chatGPT to make this chart. I speak what I eat into my phone, and it automatically updates calories. 

Hack 2: tracking cals 

Then at the end of the day I add calories burned and steps from my Apple Watch. 

Hack 3: indoor walking pad. I can easily walk 4 miles while working in the morning. Emails. Conference calls. I‚Äôm walking. It was hard at first, now it feels so easy to get 10k steps.

It‚Äôs not just a coffee mug; it‚Äôs a conversation starter, a mood setter, and, occasionally, a passive-aggressive reminder of how chaotic my mornings can be. The mug features a cheerful ‚ÄúHave a Nice Day‚Äù printed on the side. But here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîflip it over, and there‚Äôs a three-dimensional middle finger subtly revealed at the bottom. I can‚Äôt tell you how many laughs I‚Äôve gotten from friends and coworkers when they spot it.

The mug is made of ceramic, has a glossy finish, and holds up to 14 ounces of liquid. Perfect for coffee, tea, or even the occasional hot cocoa, it‚Äôs sized just right for my caffeine needs. The handle is a comfortable fit, and the rim is curved perfectly for sipping without any awkward spills. I like the fact that it‚Äôs dishwasher safe, though one reviewer mentioned hand washing might be better to avoid chipping. I‚Äôve run it through the dishwasher several times without any issues so far, but I can see how over time, that glossy finish might dull.

What really stands out is the quality of the print. The cheerful message and the middle finger image are printed directly onto the ceramic, ensuring they won‚Äôt rub off like cheap stickers. However, I‚Äôd be cautious if you plan to use it daily and want to preserve its condition. The mug came in a well-designed gift box, making it a fantastic option for white elephant exchanges, gag gifts, or quirky birthday presents. My cousin, who always has the sharpest comebacks, absolutely loved it when I gave it to him for his birthday.

**Pros**

* **Hilarious and unique design:** The middle finger at the bottom is a real crowd-pleaser, perfect for anyone with a sense of humor.
* **Durable print quality:** Both the text and the image are printed into the ceramic, so they don‚Äôt peel or fade easily.
* **Comfortable and practical:** The handle is large enough for a secure grip, and the curved rim makes sipping easy.
* **Dishwasher safe:** Cleanup is hassle-free, though hand washing might prolong its life.
* **Ideal gift packaging:** Comes in a stylish box, making it a no-brainer for gifting.

**Cons**

* **Prone to chipping:** Some users noted that the mug could chip if not handled carefully or if constantly run through the dishwasher.
* **Not everyone‚Äôs humor:** While I find it hilarious, this mug might not be suitable for more formal or sensitive settings.
* **Glossy finish may wear over time:** Frequent use and washing could diminish its shiny appearance.
* **Limited capacity for some:** Holding 14 ounces is perfect for me, but heavy coffee drinkers might find it a bit small.
* **Fragility:** Like most ceramic mugs, it‚Äôs not immune to breaking if dropped.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When I compare the Decodyne mug with other novelty mugs like BigMouth Inc's ‚ÄúToilet Mug‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCamera Lens Mug,‚Äù the Decodyne stands out for its subtle humor. The BigMouth mug is undeniably hilarious but more of a one-time gag than a functional coffee cup. Meanwhile, the Camera Lens Mug looks cool but lacks practical usability‚ÄîI‚Äôve heard complaints about heat retention and durability. Decodyne‚Äôs mug strikes a great balance between humor and functionality.

On the flip side, brands like Ello and Contigo focus more on practicality and insulation. These mugs are more suited for travel and keeping your drinks hot for extended periods, but they lack the personality and charm of the Decodyne. If your goal is to bring a smile (or giggle) to someone‚Äôs face, this mug wins hands down.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This mug is reasonably priced for its quality and humor factor. Considering it‚Äôs a functional novelty item, I‚Äôd say it offers good bang for your buck. Competitor products in the same price range often compromise on build or finish. Decodyne‚Äôs mug feels sturdy, and the quirky design makes it stand out, especially as a gift option. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest mug out there, you‚Äôre paying for the unique design and durable construction.

If you‚Äôre someone who values a good laugh during your morning coffee or knows someone who would, this mug is worth the investment. Sure, it might require a little extra care to maintain its glossy finish, but the joy it brings makes it more than worth the effort.

1io743k,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1io743k/frozen_coffee_beans_be_better/,Frozen coffee beans be better?,"I have observed in numerous places that people aren't as resolute and against store coffee beans in the freezer. and I have heard many people stating that frozen coffee beans may keep some of their flavor.

**üè∑Ô∏èThe purpose and method for freezing**

**Purpose**: First the primary reason for freezing is to keep coffee beans fresh, and to extend the period of preservation for the flavor. A low temperature can delay the process of vaporization of volatile compounds within coffee beans. Research has shown that the ideal temperature for freezing coffee beans is -40 ‚ÑÉ. However, the majority of fridges in our homes can only freeze to around -20‚ÑÉ, which means we need to be more careful regarding freezing storage.

**Method:** The freezing process can slowed down the oxidation process of coffee beans. The principle behind it is to reduce any interactions between air and coffee beans. Thus, it is ideal to make a sealed container to freeze, and remove the air as much as you can after filling with coffee beans. Also, don't freeze a large amount of coffee beans at once. It is better to break the bag into two weeks. This will ensure that the beans won't have to be frozen repeatedly inside the freezer. Since the beans are more likely to be soaked by the repeated freezing and thawing.

**üßäü´òTwo methods of freezing: flash freezing VS regular freezing**

In addition to the traditional method of freezing coffee beans can be quickly frozen by using dry freezing ice and liquid nitrogen. Here are the main characteristics of the two methods for freezing.

**Flash freezing using liquid nitrogen or dry ice:**

1. **Rapid freezing speed and incredibly low temperature**: The average temperature that dry ice has is -78.5‚ÑÉ This is significantly less than normal freezing (about -18‚ÑÉ). This low temperature is able to quickly freeze coffee beans, allowing coffee beans to swiftly move through the zone of maximum ice crystal formation during the process of freezing. This can decrease your chances of creating ice crystals.
2. **Increased brittleness without significantly increasing hardness**: when temperatures are extremely low the brittleness of coffee beans is significantly increased and it becomes simpler to break them into homogenous particles during grinding, thus improving the quality of grinding. And their hardness doesn't change as much due to the fact that the ice crystals are small.

**Regular freezing**

1. **Low freezing speeds:** Regular freezing (such as refrigerators in the home) has the slowest cooling speed. Coffee beans are able to pass through the largest ice crystal area, then the moisture will slowly grow into larger crystals of ice.
2. **The coffee beans are brittle and hard:** Coffee beans can also become brittle when exposed to temperatures that are low. However, the formation of bigger ice crystals will make coffee beans harder. This is due to the fact that the hardness of ice is greater than the structure that was originally created by coffee beans.

**üßêTwo methods of grinding coffee beans that are frozen**

After doing quite a bit of searching and googling, I learned that there are two ways of grinding coffee beans that have been frozen **grinding following thawing to room temperature** or **grinding in a frozen condition**.

I've tried grinding both after the thawing process and also grinding from frozen state. I don't think there's any different in taste between the first. However, that the coffee brewed by the **latter method is more acidic.** But, I used the refrigerator to freeze both ways. By the way , while the grind was grinding the frozen beans, my grinder was louder than it did before. I'm not sure if it was because the coffee beans are too hard.

When I google the grinding from frozen beans, some studies have found that the lower the temperature of frozen coffee beans, the more uniform the particle size and flavor. And I also found that Kyle Ramage used this way to grind in the 2017 US National Coffee Championship routine. However, he was using dry ice to freeze the coffee beans.

So, I‚Äôm curious about the **taste of coffee beans frozen with dry ice and how it differs from coffee beans frozen in a regular freezer**. Somebody ever utilized liquid nitrogen or dry ice for freezing coffee beans in order to grind them? In comparison to the normal freezing process, how does the coffee flavor? It is something that I'm really interested in. In addition, I want to know **if this grinding technique is utilized more in the case of espresso or pour-over coffee?**",0,1739408614.0,espresso,7,0.43,False
1io73hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dallasRikiTiki/comments/1io73hd/story/,Story,"Sam woke up on Sunday morning to the sun peeking through his curtains. Usually, he wakes up to his girl next to him, right where the sunlight leaks in and cuts through the smoky haze onto her face. Not today, though. This morning she‚Äôs going to work, and the sound of the shower permeating through the bedroom wall is a clear sign that the only company he‚Äôll get this morning is this bitch of a hangover from the night before. He hopes for another hour or two of half conscious snoozing. Wrapped like a mummy in blankets, he idles just barely on our side of the line separating alive and dead. The screech of his alarm clock forces him out of his slumber, beating his throbbing head into submission like a metronome with a sledgehammer for a pendulum. Sam swats his hand at the clock‚Äôs general direction, knocking a glass of water off the nightstand and scattering papers scribbled with random raps and rhymes.



>



The day‚Äôs first words barely scrape out of his dry mouth as he sits up and shuts the alarm off. It shouldn‚Äôt have been set in the first place, its Sunday after all, but the state he was in last night made him forget what day was coming next. With a pained groan he rolls out of bed and slips on his loafers while turning on the stereo and picking up the half burnt blunt he left from last night. The speakers bring life to the house as the beat begins, and with a flick of a lighter, Sam inhales and exhales with satisfaction on his face. Sam watches the smoke roll in the sun rays as he maneuvers it effortlessly between his fingers.

Frozen waffles slide into the toaster while Sam sorts through last night‚Äôs scrambled memories wondering what his friend kept trying to tell him. He pulls a coffee canister down from a shelf and retrieves several wads of cash from the bottom, after which he scoops enough coffee for several pots into one filter. Sam skips to the next song, as fresh coffee starts dripping into the pot.

He‚Äôs long moved past that question by the time he releases past presidents from their rubber band noose. Sam slides out a chair, and sits down at his kitchen table to begin rolling the day‚Äôs blunts, and checking the count: the most important part of his morning ritual.



*Uh, slammin'*

*Jumped on that I-65, stacks from the weight I just carried*

*Granny just passed, my uncle out here smokin‚Äô glass*

Sam methodically unfolds and removes bills from a wad that could barely fold in the first place and stacks them neatly on the table.



*Forgive me father cause I'm so wrong*

*Runnin' dope through your doorstep, mom I've been doing it for so long*

*When the water wasn't working and the lights was off we could barely hold on*

*Should I get going or get got?*

*But on the other hand, I got bird landin‚Äô*

*And a rubber band on my knot*



Sam slams the rest of the cash down on the table, already knowing he has more than enough to cover what he needs. The hook comes up and he gets his waffles ready to eat.

As always, today will be a busy day, and he can‚Äôt be bothered trying to find lost memories of a drunken night, let alone the new faces he met. Things to pick up, packages to drop off, people to see, and, when he has time he‚Äôll call his friend about last night. The front door opens and he steps out onto his porch. He grins at the jungle outside and gives a reluctant hello to the bright sun making the pain in his head worse. He‚Äôs prepared for it all though, his shades are already shielding his eyes, and he lifts his arms to stretch as he drags hard on the blunt. Exhaling, the odd discomfort in his back is still there, so he stretches again and holds it longer. Screeching tires shatter the easy morning vibe, and a sliding door slamming back punctuates the end of what was a peaceful morning. Before he can even react, an image from the club floods his mind; a man mouthing:



>



His eyes snap open only to be blinded by muzzle flashes.



Slowly adjusting to blindingly bright lights, and he glances over his body expecting to see nothing but red. It takes him a minute to register what he sees: black leather shoes, black dress pants, he realizes he‚Äôs wearing a suit. Without a speck of understanding he mutters



>



He looks up to see an audience of people staring back at him, to his left another man behind sitting at a desk wearing a fancy grey suit, his demeanor reminding him of those late night talk show hosts he‚Äôd seen clips of. Behind the curtain, just beyond the desk and shrouded from the spotlights stands another man. Sam can‚Äôt make out a face in the shadow, but between the lapels of his black suit sits a bright red tie, and his folded hands with scraggly nails bear a watch. Sam can feel its ticking.



On his right side sits a frail looking old man also wearing a suit, except his is white and it looks like he hasn‚Äôt shaved or been to a barber in his life. He stutters trying to ask a hundred questions at once.



>



No answers came to him, not that he would have registered them anyway after he saw what lay on the floor in front of him. He saw himself laying flat on his back, a mask over his face with tubes coming out, small holes in his arms with tubes pumping fluid in, and several holes punched through his exposed torso. Those didn‚Äôt have tubes pumping stuff in, but he could see blood was being pumped out. A flurry of gloved hands moved back and forth across his body, cutting, stitching, exploring. He‚Äôd seen all of that dreams before, so it wasn‚Äôt much of a shock, but what really got to him were the smaller versions of him standing on the left and right of his body on the floor. On the left, he was dressed in all black with a red hat poking out from under his hood. Sam thought he could see him smiling wide as he handed scalpels and other instruments to the operating hands. On the right was another small clone of himself, but the clear expression of concern and worry stood out more to Sam than the golden wings sticking out from the back of his white shirt.



He sat staring at the display in front of him, taking it all in and trying to process it. He sensed someone was watching him, but it took him some time to pull his attention from the floor. Sam looked to his right and caught the gaze of the old man in white. The man gave Sam a reassuring nod of the head, and a strange calming sensation of confidence filled him, washing out the confused anxiety and disoriented chaos that his thoughts had been for the past moments. Strangely, to Sam it felt like all of this was planned, like he was supposed to be here. Sam had experienced deja vu before, but this was something entirely different. Convinced this was a dream, he decided to go with it for as long as he had left before that damn alarm clock erupts.



Sam settled into the situation, and as his head began to slow down, things around him started picking up. People far off to the sides barking things about lighting, sound checks booming, and the host shuffling around straightening papers on his desk while trying to use a sign language- mouthed word hybrid to someone hidden behind the intensifying glare of the stage lights. The host gave a thumbs up followed by a nod, and then turned his attention the couch next to him where Sam sat.

Sam, who at that moment was so engaged in his own thoughts and unaware of the outside, was ripped back to reality with a jolt. Sam responded like a daydreaming student who the teacher had just called on.



>



With a chuckle the host gave a final nod. The lights were even brighter than before now, and the once silent void of staring eyes in front him roared to life with the energy.



Sam breezed through the introduction and small talk like a celebrity actor with years of experience.

I laughed to myself as the host began the show. Gentleman? Hell nah. Just another guy trying to make it through the night to welcome the sun into the next day, whatever that takes, would be a little more fitting. I felt a darkness slipping over me, scenes from my life faded into my consciousness. I could be consumed by that now, not with all these strange things happening right now. My stories.. interesting? Yeah, sure, maybe.. In some sick sense of the word. The type of interesting like when you see a car wreck, and something urges you to drive by slowly to see what‚Äôs going on. Definitely not the entertaining-interesting this guy meant. Interesting? No. Insane? There it is. That‚Äôs goddamn right.

If I wasn‚Äôt already dreaming, I might as well have been. I didn‚Äôt know if I was even talking. The scenes from my home were starting to be all I could see, hear, feel, smell‚Ä¶ I was a ghost walking through the streets. There‚Äôs no way I could put it into words these people would understand. If you aren‚Äôt from there, then there‚Äôs no way you can get your head around what goes on there. People just as beat down as the streets and the cars that drive on them.



>



I drifted off, getting lost in some other reality. One where chained up pitbulls barked through the night, constantly arguing with the stocato blasts of smoking barrels drumming along with sirens and screeching tires. Like the forest, with all its birds and insects, my home has its own symphony. Any chance at escape from the true nature of that place is welcome. Intoxication, sleep, shit, sometimes even death seems like the only way to get a moment away.

The silhouettes in front of me burst into laughter, as if I was fuckin‚Äô Dave Chappelle up here. Ignorance is a bliss, aint it?

There was no stopping it this time. The.. dream? Yeah, dream I guess, it engulfed me. The set transformed into the same street I used to take to get home every night. The pavement and sidewalks had all the same cracks, with the weeds growing through it, bearing the scars of all that goes on here. The stage lights were gone, but the full moon leaked just enough light to see through the light fog that always settles down in this hell hole. A faint glow crept in from the neon signs and buildings from downtown.. That touristy place that might as well be as many worlds away from here as the few stars I could make out through the haze. I hovered down the middle of the road, still seated in my chair. The familiar feelings of unease and hopeless paranoia draped over me like a blanket, and to be honest, I‚Äôm so used to that feeling that by now I never really feel comfortable without that blanket any way. Muscle memory guided my hand to my waistband to where my I always kept my 9 mm pistol. People joke about close friends being attached at the hip, but I feel like they don‚Äôt really know what that means until they see my cold, metal Siamese twin and I walking around. Scenes from the past played out in front of me, my hands gripping the gun as this ‚Äòdream‚Äô held the reigns and moved me forward.



The sound of a piano playing slow minor arpeggios faded in, and the dogs barking, doors slamming and chain link fences rattling became musical. Ghosts, or just tangible figments of my imagination, came from out of houses and behind fences to go about their business around me. Scenes from times past set in motion again, just as real as when they actually happened. I couldn‚Äôt contain the emotion anymore, I couldn‚Äôt dumb my explanation down any further, and the cool cucumber facade I was putting on disappeared. I looked to the moon, mouth open to spit out the words in my mouth, and eject the emotion building in my stomach.



*Wa da-da dang.. wa da-da da-da dang*

*Listen to my nine millimeter go bang*

*People hustle, people murder*

*for this dope and cocaine*



Shots rang out, and I could barely make out two figures vanishing into the night. The chair pushed on passed spent casings still spinning on the ground, and towards someone desperately trying to swim out of a growing pool of his own blood. The casings fell still at the same time the man did, both now finding rest, and just as empty as they were five years ago.



*If I'm out here doing bad*

*I'm knocking down your door mane*



A slide pulled back and released, and right on que the sound of wood shattering pierced the night as yelling voices faded into another violated home.



*Shit, our scene might leave you terrified...*

*That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside*

*Got partners locked up up-state*

*Some partners on fed time*

*Shoot first and ask questions later*

*Boy you ain‚Äôt never dying, ain‚Äôt never dying*



A chorus of faceless voices came in as I admired the etchings on the grip of my pistol



*Wa da-da dang.. wa da-da da-da dang*

*Listen to my nine millimeter go bang*



I stood from my chair and walked ahead on under my own feet, and over the voices I continued:



*How I take somebody‚Äôs life like it‚Äôs all right*

*It‚Äôs so strange*



My pistol raises to the 18 year old in front of me.. My vengeance enters his head and exits, this time joined by more than just his humanity and innocence.



*Put your family in the trunk, man,*

*It's a very cold game*



His mother and young sisters, bound with duct tape, heaved into the back of a car. That kid killed my boy and his baby momma.. What goes around comes around.



*Shit, our scene might leave you terrified*

*That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside*

*Got partners locked up up-state,*

*Some partners on fed time*

*Shoot first and ask questions later,*

*Boy you ain't never dying, ain't never dying*



The voices kept droning on



*Wa da-da dang.. wa da-da da-da dang*

*Listen to my nine millimeter go bang*



I stared up to the busted streetlight above. I watched it flickering, as if clinging to life just barely despite its shattered glass. I had to laugh to myself.. I don‚Äôt remember much from school but I do know what my English teacher taught us about irony in the eighth grade.



*Wa da-da dang.. wa da-da da-da dang*

*Listen to my nine millimeter go bang*



I struggled to remember half of what was going on around me.. Let alone half of the faces around me. I mutter to myself



>



A satisfying metal on metal sound soothes my ears as my hand guides the slide back. Nothing good lasts here though, even the dandelions pushing up from the cracked concrete sidewalks look defeated. Tires screech up ahead, doors open and slam shut. More yelling.



>



The drums come back into the music from down the street as my pistol chimes in with its own harmony



*Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang*

*Listen to my 9-millimeter split your brain*

*Bullets hit you, and whistle past you*

*Old neighbor and the police harass you*

*If you came up quick with a flip, sittin good from the last lick*

*How long will that last you?*



>



My pistol slides back to my hip. I close my eyes seeking a moment of peace, and with a sigh I admit:



>



*Lord...*

*Rinse my soul clean.. Ha*

*I start my day off with Ocean Spray and promethazine*

*Used to roll them stogies, get blowed,*

*And sprinkle shit in my green*

*Straight thugged out, dubbed out,*

*Only get out in a hearse,*

*That‚Äôs the real scene*

*No limousines*



My eyes open to find myself back on the set, the lights seem much brighter than they were before now. The host seems absolutely shocked, silent, eyes wide and staring off into the audience. In this moment, the only break in the silence is a set of faint footsteps and an intermittent beeping from what I assume is the machines keeping him alive in the surgery scene before me. Unsure of how to handle the awkwardness, I shift my attention from the host of the show to where the beeping is coming from. The version of myself in the white shirt has turned, with his head hanging down, as if disappointed by something, and is walking off stage.



The red tie man now smiles, and begins to move towards the desk as if it‚Äôs his turn to clock in. There‚Äôs a¬†*consuming*¬†gravity to this man as draws nearer.

A tap on my shoulder brings my attention to the couch to the right, where the bearded old man‚Äôs eyes meet mine, and with an inquisitive look on his face he says:

Text","Previously I posted on here about having my first ever date last month. After nearly full year of almost daily texting and lot of worry and anxiety leading up to the meet up it actually turned out pretty great. What was a simple coffee chat turned into a 4 and a half hour talk about our lives, hobbies and special interests. While I thought I spilled to much spaghetti following it I was genuinely shocked that he sent me a text afterwards wanting to meet up again. Two weeks later we ended up going on a dinner and drinks date that also turned into a four hour chat that went very well. While there was no kissing/hand holding or any sort of PDA during either (I never got any signals that was an option because I'm an idiot and or Autistic) they both went about as good as I thought they could go and I definitely felt that there was a bit of a spark between us. Last week I took the initiative to ask him out for an other date and after five days on read (he's an historically bad texter) he sent back an text saying that while I was ""a Super cool badass dude"" he wanted to continue going out but only as friends. It genuinely felt like a knife in the gut. I know that it was probably a bad move on my part brought on my shock and the crushing weight of rejection but I fired back a text asking a yes or no question on if he was attracted to me (because, and let's be honest, I'm kind of lacking in the face/body/personality/neurotypicalness/socio economical/ geographicational departments) just for a clear and honest answer but only got back a refused to answer honestly ""I'm not interested romantically but I am interested platonically"" text. I haven't responded back to him yet because I'm not sure where to take it from here. 

So here's my actual question: Do I just call it a loss and move on or do I go the just friends route? 

My knee jerk reaction was to give into the whole ""boys are terrible and everything sucks forever"" thing and block him immediately while I gave into the very real possibility that I'm going to be a forever alone cave troll because hey it's been 10 years on the gay apps and the one real date I had with an actual guy that I was starting to have real feelings for rebuffed me after the second meet up but, after a few days to think about it, a lot of dark thoughts, and bunch of openly crying (again, literally all of these emotions are new to me at 32 years old) I'm starting to think that platonic might be the way to go?

On one hand he knows all about my many quirks and has so far been very accepting of them, the repport is really good and it would be nice to have an actual IRL gay guy friend because I really have none and I know once you're over 30 friendships are almost impossible to form (even if you're a straight person) but on the other hand going that route sounds like the most pathetic ""cucked"" thing imaginable and I don't know if I could still interact with him knowing that I whiffed it that bad and being constantly aware that I was stuck permanently in the friend zone. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.

TL;DR Went on 2 dates, thought they went great, got hit with the ""just friends?"" text. Not sure if I should give in and go that route or just block him and keep holding out for something more from someone else

My father raised me to be a victim, to yield on my needs and to accept less than I deserve and be grateful for it. This year, when he again tried to make last minute plans, demanding that my schedule yield just because he has said it should, I said no. He uses Used Car Salesman pressure tactics to trick me into accepting something against my better judgement. But I realized what had happened after sleeping on it. So I sent a message in the morning to cancel the last minute plans.

> Hey, I'm sorry I'm not feeling good this morning. I had a bad night and after my shift tonight I'm going to want to come home to my cats and go back to bed. 
> 
> I want to say that I had intended to avoid agreeing to such an event in any case. February 10th has been scheduled for Monday of this year for quite some time, we did not learn about it yesterday. I have said on many occasions that Mondays are hard for me, very busy. Yet the evening of February 9th was seemingly the correct time to rearrange the attempt that mom had made to celebrate me.
> 
> In case I'm not being clear about my boundary here, I feel like an after thought. I'm not someone you make plans with, I'm someone who gets included in plans the last minute (if at all).

> So, in recognition of all this, I made plans with myself last week to do my normal routine and spend time with my cats for my birthday. I going to keep my plans because I made them for my birthday a week in advance.

He showed up at my house Monday night walking along the tethered line of his rage, his shoulders pulled back, his arms crossed, glaring down his nose at this loathsome little creature that would dare challenge him. I don't really remember what was said but I know this time, this fight, was really different. I did not cry and I pulled my shoulders back to face him in my own right.

Still, I couldn't say all of what I wanted to say to his face. So I tried to put the words into a powerpoint because I can't keep them inside of me anymore (if I get any more fibromyalgia-y my body will simply collapse in and become a neutron star of dense muscle tension). I showed the thread that traced from January and the various conversations that lead to the events. (I want to post the whole slide show but I am very much burnt out and I don't know how to turn an odp/pdf into a reddit post so maybe another day.) It's 18 slides of raw, uncut emotional maturity. A deeply wounded woman desperate to get her father to just pick a different day, repeatedly saying that I feel unwanted, an afterthought, and all I ask is that a different day be chosen so that it feels intentional. Purposeful.

He emailed me back ten minutes after I sent him this document showcasing 20 hours of emotional labor.

> Leah, let me get the actual numbers. 
> How many times a year do you invite your dad to coffee? Or sushi? Or is it always his responsibility to invite you? 
> 
> I think he tried twice to make the sushi lunch happen but you were too busy. 

Dear reader, let me offer this correction: he actually tried three times to make sushi happen. On Monday.

I emailed him back:

> That was a very thoughtful and leveled response. Thank you.

so this morning i texted him being like ‚Äúhey i hate leaving stuff open ended and weird, i thought u were super cute and cool and i enjoyed learning stuff abt u‚Äù 
it took him almost all day to respond, like 8 hours and he said basically ‚Äú youre really attractive and cool too, i dont think we should meet up again before i leave bc especially bc ur not used to casual dating (positive he means casual sex/hook up) i dont wanna create any attachments that would upset either of us, but id like to see u when i come back‚Äù 
i was happy with this reply honestly, it put to rest all the overthinking i had done about doing/saying something wrong or just him finding me fugly (but why would he kiss me at the end is my thought process idk maybe hes desperate?) 
so i responded essentially with ‚Äúhey we r definitely on the same page, id love to chill again one day bc i find u cool and interesting outside of a relationship or hooking up. idk if ur down to talk as friends but if not, i hope u find wht ur looking for in ur travels and that ur safe and fulfilled by these adventues, and i actually would have loved to hook up (despite not doing so often) and he has since not responded. i really thought i was communicating in a mature way this entire time, i wasnt trying to be overbearing or portray myself as more invested than i should be, maybe i made a mistake in these messages. i really admire human connection, i rlly try to prioritize clear and concise communication its so important to me, but maybe i came off as ‚Äútoo much‚Äù because i saw that he had watched my instagram story (we followed each other the day i sent him my number) and when i clicked on his account he had soft blocked me. so again, he has done the opposite of what hes communicating in a way that makes me feel weird and overly emotional. i truthfully wasnt super interested in him until it got spun into me thinking i had done something wrong. even with the kiss, i wasnt Super into it, his breath smelled kinda bad and he lowk ate my face lol, but once i left i think i started romanticizing him and his interest in me‚Ä¶ like im very much a girl that likes to be yearned for. idk i could just be extremely overdramatic about it, but i just hate the whiplash this has caused as well as all the self doubt. when i met up with him i was in a state of mind that made me feel like the shit and now i like dont wanna meet up with another guy bc i dont like this weird immature shit. im a grown woman at the end of the day and i dont have time for these weird little boy games. 
id love to hear opinions from a community that uses the app consistently (its honestly more of a boredom thing for me) like is this a common occurrence or is it just me? bc i really feel like it got blown out of proportion but idk if it was my fault or not !! also i did end up blocking his number and his instagram, i just dont think its worth risking texting him again when im upset, and i really dont think hes deserving of my energy.

I‚Äôm female, just turned 40, I have about 40-50 pounds to lose, and I have a family history of elevated cholesterol. I know my diet has been poor and I‚Äôm now working on that plus adding exercise, and thought I better check on my sugars and lipids for a baseline. 

Figured I would ask some questions on my results before my appointment with a teleheatlh doc soon. I‚Äôd like to be well informed before then!

(Converted from mmol/L)

Fasting for 14hrs before test

Total 225
LDL 142
HDL 44
Chol/HDL risk ratio 5.12
Non HDL 4.7

Triglycerides 197

Fasting glucose 5.3 (95 mg/dL)), A1C also 5.3

I‚Äôve done fasting before and I am planning on doing so again, 24-36hr once a week and then a 16:8 window the rest of the time, mostly to improve insulin sensitivity and improve my A1C. I‚Äôve done a couple so far and felt fine. 

Definitely the real change is avoiding saturated fats. I‚Äôve given up butter, no cream in my coffee (this is hard!!), and I love baked goods and chocolate‚Ä¶taking a hard line on those right now and eventually hoping I can add them back in very strict moderation once my results improve. I don‚Äôt eat a ton of red meat and if I do it‚Äôs lean, but I am still minimizing it to one serving a week and adding in salmon instead. I do use 1% milk for lattes and I like Greek yogurt, cottage cheese for protein. I‚Äôm keeping those for now. I‚Äôve also increased fiber a lot based on some suggestions from this sub - bought some frozen berries for dessert, I take 2 6g servings of Metamucil a day, and for breakfast I‚Äôm now eating steel cut oats in almond milk with flax seed. Also adding in nuts in limited quantities and pumpkin seeds. I‚Äôve already been tracking and weighing my food for some time so I am pretty good at that, I‚Äôm now using the program to track a goal of 10g sat fat per day. 

Open to other suggestions as well for diet and food ideas, and any thoughts on the bloodwork. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm yet a candidate for a statin, or am I? What‚Äôs the risk level for me having cholesterol numbers like this at my age? I will definitely ask the doctor at my next appointment but I‚Äôd like to be informed first.

I end up door dashing between two and four Starbucks double shot espresso and spending $20 on two drinks I could get for six dollars if I went to the store. But like I said, I don‚Äôt have a car and the nearest store it‚Äôs a 17 minute walk there and back and I‚Äôm way too lazy and or don‚Äôt have the motivation to do that every single day. 

I also started smoking nicotine because I couldn‚Äôt smoke weed anymore. I‚Äôm hitting that thing constantly. Although I have slowed down a little bit recently. I‚Äôve had this bottle of juice for two weeks and it‚Äôs half gone instead of one bottle every week.  

I got rid of the drugs, but now I feel like I have other vices I can‚Äôt shake, and I feel dependent on them. I don‚Äôt know how to stop and this coffee thing, especially the DoorDash, is really draining me financially but I just can‚Äôt seem to help my cravings. And not to mention I have an online shopping addiction as well. It‚Äôs just so easy to buy things cause i don‚Äôt have to go anywhere to get what I want. I can‚Äôt afford this anymore haha. I tried deleting DoorDash but I just redownloaded it. I guess I need my sister to put a lock on the App Store so I can‚Äôt redownload it. But it helps sometimes when I need to buy groceries üò´ 

Am I alone on this? Any advice for me? üò´

I am the founder of Coastal Coffee Company in WA state. I've got a long background in coffee & management, and I've known for many years that I wanted my own coffee company one day-- but I didn't feel overly passionate about the idea until I realized that what I want is to give back to my community and help those in need. 

My city is drowning with victims of homelessness and seemingly also classist monsters who treat them like garbage. I could go on forever about this issue,  but to keep it somewhat short, I will share that my coffee business now puts a focus on re-humanizing the unhoused community, helping individuals and shelters directly, and connecting them with local resources, as well as employment down the line. The problem is-- I have the plans, but I don't have funding for any of this. I have a legal business, a website and socials, but I need a minimum of $25k to get this off the ground and grow it to be able to continue funding itself. I've applied for grants, which I am still waiting to hear back about, but putting myself out there on here as well. Would love to chat with anyone willing to support a great cause!

I just got a df54 after having a manual grinder for almost two years with my fp2.  I was happy with the results, lately I was really having a hard time motivating myself to grind so I decided to go electric.  

My question is; what is a good setting to start at to get me close to what you guys with a fp2 are using.  I know every bean is different and I might need to calibrate and align.  I just to be in the ballpark to not waste a lot of coffee. 

I usually only have Ethiopian beans and on the light/medium range.  My doses have been 15g most of the time.  

With my manual I was doing good and dialing in pretty quick, I just need a starting ballpark number.

I'm reflecting on the relationship and need some help determining if this break-up was in fact a blessing in disguise.,"It‚Äôs my first time posting here and I would really appreciate everyone's input.

¬†

Jane (pseudonym) and I started dating in June 2023 after meeting on a dating app. About 5-6 dates in, she had a change of heart and wanted to break things off. I responded saying that I understood and wished her all the best. Surprisingly, within 24 hours, she reached out again to talk, and after meeting in person, she decided she wanted to give it another try (much time later, she would admit that she was ‚Äúlooking for a reason to stay‚Äù).

¬†

Fast forward to October 2023, when I asked her if she‚Äôd consider exclusivity. She declined and I accepted, and we continued to date as usual.

¬†

Come December 2023, she informs me that she bought a one-way ticket to Mexico for February 2024. Although I knew for a while that she had plans to go to Mexico to work remotely and escape our harsh winters (we‚Äôre in Canada), I still felt insecure about her leaving for a long time without us discussing what exactly we were. So, over breakfast one morning, I asked her what she was looking for and what she wanted from our relationship. I again suggest exclusivity, to which she responded, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between dating and exclusivity?‚Äù After some further talk, she agreed to being exclusive and got a little emotional from the conversation (she would later ‚Äòjoke‚Äô to her friends and family by referring to this conversation was the ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù).

¬†

The relationship lasted a year (until December 2024), during which time the following happened (some highlights):

¬†

* I went to visit her in Mexico twice (she was gone for a month), during which time she got pregnant. I had to find her a pregnancy test because she couldn‚Äôt be bothered to purchase one and find out herself (in her words, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of knowing now? We‚Äôre in Mexico. We can't do anything about it.‚Äù). After returning home, she wanted to terminate the pregnancy, and I supported her the whole way through. Afterwards though she refused to talk about what happened.
* She was initially still friends with her ex-boyfriend (she still had a photo of the two of them on her fridge, which she took down when she noticed it bothered me). After telling her ex that she was seeing him, he started acting up (demanding more attention, etc.) and she was forced to end that friendship.
* On multiple occasions, she said to me things like, ‚ÄúAre our personalities compatible?‚Äù, or she would admit that she had doubts about us, only to take them back immediately afterwards.
* She was extremely emotional on her period (which she admitted) and would tell me that I had to ""put up"" with it every month (she once had a public emotional breakdown while on vacation because she couldn't find a restaurant that was open).
* She once grabbed coffee with a male friend who she once had a crush on (and slept with). She told me beforehand, but it wasn't her idea to tell me (one of her girlfriends told her that it might be appropriate to let me know).
* She grabbed lunch with a guy at work, assuming it was a recruitment or business lunch. That same guy asked her out for dinner, and she asked me how she should respond to his invitation (rather than just decline it).
* When we started dating, she wasn't in therapy, but decided to go back into it because she was impressed by how dedicated I was to my therapy journey (I've been in it for 10+ years). However, some time later, she told me that she spent every therapy session she had talking about how different her and I were and asking her therapist at what point does she ""keep going"" with the relationship.



Now in all honesty, I had my flaws as well. I have anxiety, sometimes I'm grumpy, I can be overly sensitive, etc. But I'd like to think that I did the best with what I had. I do love her a lot, and when she ended things, I was a bit blindsided.

¬†

About 1.5 months after the break-up, I reached out for closure. During that conversation, she said that the reason why she broke up with me was because she was ""unsure of the relationship from the beginning, but that she ignored her concerns, hoping that they would go away on their own."" But after one year, her unsureness was still there, which made her pull the plug. She also divulged that she did love me at one point, but then later didn't anymore, hence why she ""stopped saying it or said it less frequently"".



I guess I'm just looking for some validation from this sub that this breakup is in fact a blessing in disguise for me. Thank you so much for reading!
