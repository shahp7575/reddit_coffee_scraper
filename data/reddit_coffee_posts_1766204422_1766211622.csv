1pr75kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1pr75kd/what_is_a_human/,What is a Human?,"In the old times, those distant, sepia-toned days of yore, a typical human came equipped with two legs, two arms, two eyes, a head, and a soft, squishy interior stuffed with bits and bobs that nobody fully understood but everyone agreed were very very important.

But by *Galactic Year 5047.95,* the whole idea of ""being human"" had become one of those infuriatingly nebulous concepts, like trying to determine the precise second at which a cup of tea stops being *""hot""* and becomes *""lukewarm.""*

The shift had been subtle at first. You'd be sitting in a pub, having a friendly debate about the meaning of life (still an absolute mystery), and suddenly you’d notice that half the people in the room were being held together with bits of metal and plastic. Eye glasses, pacemakers, replacement hips *etc.*

At first, no one seemed particularly bothered by this. After all, if Grandma could get an artificial arm and still bake you cookies, it was hard to argue that she wasn’t human. Then, one day, someone suggested that perhaps it would be a good idea if all humans could stop being so squishy. This seemed like a perfectly reasonable proposal, and soon cybernetic enhancements became the new fashion.

The first wave was simple: a shiny eye here, a huge metal hand there, and the occasional titanium spleen for those who felt their original spleens were underperforming. But, as with most things humans set their minds to, it didn’t stop there. By the end of the century, people were swapping out body parts like spare batteries.

Soon, there were arguments about whether someone with only 7% organic material could still be considered human. This led to the invention of the *""Humanity Index,""* a complex algorithm designed to measure just how human someone was, based on factors like biological tissue, emotional capacity, and how often they laughed at videos of other sentient beings (human or not) getting pranked.

Then, of course, came the genetic modifications. People started tweaking their genomes like they were editing a particularly bad novel, replacing *""prone to allergies""* with *""can breathe underwater""* and *""average height""* with *""looks like a Greek god but very very tall.""* Before long, there were people with gills, wings, and, in one particular case, six heads, each of which had different opinions on what to have for breakfast.

The galaxy was now populated by a dizzying array of beings who were technically descendants of Homo sapiens but looked and behaved like something out of a particularly creative fever dream. There was the accountant from Zthrag-III who had turned her entire body into a purple flamingo; the poet from Tlgeuse-VI who had rewritten her DNA to include the expressive range of a humpback whale; and the entire population of the planet New–New Australia, which had collectively decided to turn themselves into kangaroos, despite the fact that none of them shared any ancestral connection with the continent of Australia on humanity’s mother planet, Terra.

The philosophers, of course, had a field millennium. They asked questions like, *""Is humanity defined by biology or by consciousness?""* and, *""If a person has no organic parts but still experiences the inexplicable discomfort of Mondays, are they still human?""*

These debates rumbled on for centuries, primarily in pretentious cafés where the coffee tasted as though it had been distilled through a sock that had recently participated in a marathon, and the chairs seemed specifically designed to discourage deep philosophical discussions by being too uncomfortable to sit in for more than five minutes.

The more ""serious"" academic discussions, however, took place in grand auditoriums with titles like *“The Pan-Dimensional Symposium on Ontological Obfuscations (Free Coffee and Biscuits),”* and on talk shows where impeccably groomed philosophers fervently debated the existence of the soul and whether humanity was teetering on the brink of extinction.

The Galactic Council finally decided to resolve the issue once and for all by passing the *""Universal Definition of Humanity Act"" (UDHA).* The act defined a human as *""any being who identifies as human, provided they possess at least a trace of human DNA and a reasonably convincing backstory.""*",2,1766210358.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

Madison Shaw had learned one hard truth early in life, her face was a magnet for trouble. 

From a young age, her striking looks made her a magnet for trouble, attracting a constant stream of 

unwanted attention. 

By the time she turned eighteen and was ready for college, the lifelong “good girl” had finally had enough. 

She made a radical decision. Hiring a professional makeup artist, she commissioned a custom 

“ugly” transformation, a meticulously crafted disguise that effectively concealed her striking beauty beneath layers of artificial plainness. 

Leaving her identity as the Shaw family heiress behind, she set off for Northwood University alone, 

determined to build a normal life. 

For two blissful years, the strategy worked perfectly. Shielded by her plain-Jane persona, Madison enjoyed the peaceful anonymity she’d always craved, free from the complications her looks usually brought. 

That all changed on a Christmas Eve during her sophomore year. While celebrating at a bar with her roommate, Madison watched in dismay as a group of guys began aggressively harassing her pretty friend, their hands wandering where they weren’t welcome. 

Madison’s temper flared. Stepping forward despite her pounding heart, she positioned herself between her friend and the harassers. 

“Hey! What do you think you’re doing?” she challenged, her voice cutting through the noise. “Can’t you hear my friend saying she doesn’t want to talk to you?” 

One of the men turned his contemptuous gaze on her, shoving her aside with a rough, dismissive hand. “Back off, ugly,” he sneered. “We weren’t hitting on you. Why are you butting in?” 

The force sent her stumbling backward, right into the solid, unexpected support of a stranger’s 

arms. 

As she regained her balance and looked up, her breath caught. The man holding her was ridiculously handsome, with features so perfectly sculpted they seemed almost unreal. He stood a head taller, all long limbs and lean strength, and as he glanced down at her, one eyebrow arched in curious amusement. 

“What’s going on here?” His voice was as captivating as his appearance, though it carried a lazy, almost bored drawl. 

He gave her a slow, appraising look. “Since when do they let minors into bars?” 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

Madison was dazed for a long moment before she managed to stammer, “I’m 21… I 

I just…” 

I just look young, she meant to say. 

But before she could finish, the man suddenly leaned in, closing the distance between them in an 

instant. 

Madison could even see the reflection of the fake freckles on her face in his pupils. 

“You look familiar,” he muttered to himself. “Do you go to Northwood University?” 

Madison nodded instinctively. She saw the corner of his mouth quirk up. 

“So you’re my junior then.” He straightened up and looked at the troublemakers, his smile casual and unconcerned. “You’ve got some nerve, picking on my junior.” 

The previously arrogant guys instantly paled. “Mr. Quinn… we didn’t know she was with you…”, then they turned and fled in a panic. 

Madison only pieced it together later, the man who’d stepped in was none other than Ethan Quinn, the trust-fund baby whose reputation for trouble was the stuff of walking legend all over Northwood’s coffee shops and fraternity houses. 

He was recklessness personified, a slave to his own whims with a reputation for chaos that trailed 

him like a shadow. 

People said if he woke up and decided he wanted the moon, he wouldn’t just try to buy it, he’d probably figure out how to pull it down from the sky himself, just to prove a point. 

But two years ago, for reasons no one understood, he’d suddenly donated a building to Northwood University and even enrolled as a graduate student. 

He rarely attended classes, just occasionally roared past campus in various luxury sports cars. Yet, despite all that, his face alone was enough to attract countless female admirers at school. 

Rumor had it the girls who had a crush on him could form a line that circled the library ten times over. There were even stories of girls attempting suicide over him. 

The moment the New Year’s countdown bells rang, Madison suddenly realized, She was about to become one of them. For the first time in her life, Madison had a crush on someone. 

From that day on, she’d bring him breakfast and even custom-ordered a spirit shirt from the campus print shop with his last name and jersey number, leaving it anonymously in his locker. 

During one of his basketball games, she sneakily put a carton of milk in his bag, only to be caught 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

red-handed by him and his friends. 

His friends burst into laughter. One, feeling slightly sympathetic, reminded her, “Hey, Freckles, our man Ethan doesn’t drink matcha…” 

But before the words fully left his mouth, they watched in shock as Ethan picked up the matcha milk Madison had given him and drank every last drop. 

Then he leaned close to Madison’s ear, his voice low. “I prefer strawberry flavour.” 

He caught the faint scent of strawberry body wash from her skin and chuckled softly. “Something that smells like you.” 

Madison’s heart slammed against her ribs. Looking into the man’s teasing, half-smiling eyes, she 

knew she was a goner. 

On Valentine’s Day, Madison finally mustered the courage to confess her feelings to Ethan. 

She had assumed a boring girl like her would definitely be rejected. Ethan might seem carefree and irreverent, but in two years, he had never agreed to date any woman. 

To her surprise, Ethan spoke slowly and deliberately, “Madison, being with me means you’ll 

become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you… willing to accept that?” 

Madison was stunned for a second, then her heart exploded with joy, mirroring the fireworks 

blooming overhead. “I… I am willing!” 

Madison originally thought Ethan’s question was just a casual remark. But she never expected that 

after they started dating, her assignments would be torn up, her locker spray-painted, and girls 

who liked Ethan would trip her in the cafeteria. 

Having grown up sheltered and protected by the Shaw family, Madison was obedient and naive, completely unprepared for this kind of treatment. 

Now, she faced daily harassment. The worst incident was when she was kidnapped by Ethan’s 

enemies and locked in a warehouse for a full day and night. 

After she was safe, Ethan pressed a kiss to her forehead, his voice a low murmur. “I’m sorry you 

went through that, Maddie.” 

And just like that, every moment of fear and uncertainty stilled. In that single sentence, she found a 

gentle anchor, and the world felt right again. 

Until, just before graduation, the most sought-after girl in the Advertising Department was thrown 

into the campus lake. 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

Madison followed the crowd to the lake’s edge, only to see Ethan, acting like a madman, brutally beating a man on the ground. 

His eyes were bloodshot, the usual playful arrogance on his face replaced by pure fury. “I told you! Stay away from Chloe Grant! Are you deaf?!” 

Chloe Grant, the most sought-after girl of their department. 

Ethan only stopped punching when the man’s face was a bloody mess. Then he scooped Chloe up into his arms and carried her away. As the man passed by Madison, she managed a weak, “Ethan…” 

But he didn’t even glance her way. 

The crowd of onlookers soon dispersed, but Madison stood there, frozen in place. She walked over to the beaten, bruised man and asked softly, “Why…?” 

The man forced his eyes open, recognized Madison, and let out a low laugh. “You’re the new girlfriend Ethan’s seeing? You want to know why I went after Chloe Grant?” 

He sneered, intense hatred flashing in his eyes. “Because my sister killed herself over Ethan Quinn! So I’m going to torment the woman he loves for revenge!” 

“And the woman Ethan Quinn loves is Chloe Grant! Why else do you think a spoiled rich brat like him would come study at Northwood? He followed her here because he fell for her at first sight!” 

“But too many girls like him, and he’s pissed off too many people. Everyone targeted Chloe for revenge. She was harassed so badly she had to take a year off, developed depression, and that’s why they broke up.” 

“As for you…” The guy gave Madison a scornful look. 

“A plain Jane like you… you don’t actually think Ethan likes you, do you? Let’s be real. You’re just a decoy he found to draw fire away from his real girlfriend.” 

Madison’s face instantly lost all color. She remembered the day she confessed, when Ethan had asked her, “Being with me means you’ll become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you willing to accept that?” 

So… so that was what he meant. He was never worried about her getting hurt. He wanted her to be a 

human shield for the girl he truly loved. 

Madison had no idea how she made it back to her dorm. She threw away her umbrella and walked through the pouring rain, her waterproof makeup streaking and washing away. 

When she finally reached her dorm entrance, just as she was about to go inside, “Madison?” 

Chapter 1

A familiar male voice rang out. She turned and saw Ethan standing under her dorm window, apparently waiting for her. Before Madison could say anything, Ethan spoke first, looking stunned. 

“Madison, your face…”

flair for drama. 

In the year she was partying hardest overseas, her father yanked her back home with an overnight express letter marked URGENT. It held only one cold line: \[Come home at once. Marry Ethan Foster.\] 

Ethan Foster was the youngest rising star on the base–cool, restrained, almost ascetic, rigidly 

self–disciplined, the complete opposite of her in every way. 

She thrived on noise and crowds; he preferred quiet and order. 

She did whatever she liked and had a long history of reckless stunts, while he followed every rule to the 

letter, treating discipline like something carved in stone. 

She was bright and free–spirited, changing boyfriends the way other people changed clothes, and he was infamous for avoiding women altogether, never even brushing the hand of a female soldier under his 

command. 

Just thinking about marrying a man so straight–laced made her feel like she couldn’t breathe. 

So, determined to blow up the wedding, Scarlett threw everything she had at the problem. 

She partied and danced for three straight nights at a downtown club, hoping he’d finally back off, but he 

showed up in full dress uniform, and under all the curious stares, he calmly slung her onto his back and 

carried her home. 

She deliberately crashed into the base commander’s front–yard fence, wanting him to see how outrageous 

she could be, but he went over in person to apologize, paid for the repairs, and buried the whole thing before 

it could spread. 

She charged forward raising hell without a care, and he was always right behind her, quietly cleaning up 

whatever mess she left in her wake. 

This time, she’d gotten into another fight and was being held at the station. He had just finished a three–day emergency mission when he rushed over to bail her out, still in uniform, his eyes bloodshot with exhaustion. 

Looking at his tired but ramrod–straight back, Scarlett felt a rare urge to explain herself. 

She wanted to say that this time she wasn’t the one causing trouble, that the other guy had made a move on 

her first because he thought she was pretty, but before she could get the words out, Ethan was already in 

front of her, gently taking her hand. 

There was a tiny cut on the tip of her finger, something she hadn’t even noticed, and he pulled a small

first–aid kit from his uniform pocket, lowered his head, disinfected the wound, and pressed a bandage over it. 

“Does it hurt?” he asked. 

In that moment, every excuse and argument Scarlett had prepared jammed in her throat. 

He lifted his gaze, his eyes steady. “I don’t care how much trouble you cause or how big a mess you make. I 

can handle all of that. The only thing I care about is whether this–right here–hurts.” 

Does this hurt… 

Scarlett’s heart lurched, as if something had slammed into the softest part of her chest, shatter 

one of her defenses in an instant. 

✓ last 

All her life, whenever she got into trouble, her father only shouted about how embarrassing she was, and her stepmother only put on a fake show of telling her to act like a lady, but not once had anyone ever asked her 

if she was hurt, or if she felt wronged. 

With her voice gone hoarse, she heard herself say, “Ethan, we can get married.” 

Something like a flicker of light passed through his dark eyes. 

“But before that, I need to ask you something,” she pressed, her pride and possessiveness sharpening her tone. “Do you have anyone you’ve ever loved and couldn’t have? My man has to belong to me completely. He doesn’t get to have anyone else in his heart–past, present, or future. It can only be me.” 

Ethan’s gaze locked onto hers, heavy and unwavering. “No. Only you.” 

So Scarlett married him. 

Southport’s wildest red rose married the coldest, most untouchable officer in the entire military. 

After the wedding, one line started making the rounds in Southport’s upper circles. 

Of all the people you could mess with, don’t you dare mess with General Foster’s wife, Scarlett Jones. 

Because no matter how big a mess she made, that stone–faced grim reaper of a general would still be right behind her, always having her back and keeping the world from crashing down on her. 

Scarlett honestly believed that she’d melted that block of ice with her fire. 

Right up until the day she went out to the base to drop off some files Ethan had forgotten at home. 

As she reached the training grounds, she saw a cluster of officers gathered together in what looked like some sort of mixer, where the mood was loud and lively. 

Chanter 1

Ethan was surrounded by a few fellow officers, and it looked like he’d just lost a game and was being pushed into answering one of those truth–or–dare questions. 

Someone called out, loud and clear, “General Foster, come on–what’s the biggest lie you’ve ever told in your 

life?” 

The noise around them dipped, the group settling down as everyone turned to watch the commanding officer who was known for being rigidly honest. 

Ethan was silent for a moment, his profile shadowed and hard under the lights, and then he picked up the coffee mug in front of him, took a sip, and finally spoke, his voice low but clear enough to carry right to 

where Scarlett had just stepped into the doorway. 

“Someone once asked me if I had someone I loved and couldn’t have.” 

“I lied and told her no.” 

It was like a thunderclap going off inside her head. 

Scarlett froze where she stood, every drop of blood in her body turning to ice. 

He’d lied? 

He had someone he loved and couldn’t have? 

Then why had he told her he didn’t? 

Why had he married her at all? 

A chill shot up from the soles of her feet and raced through her entire body, leaving her feeling like she’d been dropped into a block of ice, her limbs shaking from the cold. 

She was just about to storm over and demand an answer when one of his aides hurried to Ethan’s side and murmured something in his ear. 

Ethan’s usually composed face changed in an instant. 

He shot to his feet so fast he didn’t even pause to explain to anyone, snatched his uniform jacket from the back of his chair, and headed for the door, moving so quickly he left a gust of air in his wake. 

He didn’t even notice her standing right there in the doorway. 

As he barreled past, his shoulder slammed hard into hers, and he didn’t react at all, like every sense he had was locked onto a single target up ahead. 

Scarlett staggered from the hit, pain flaring in her shoulder, but the ache in her chest was even worse. 

Chantor 1

She swallowed the pain and the roiling questions in her gut and found herself following after him on instinct. 

She watched Ethan jump into a Jeep, the engine roaring to life before it shot out of the lot like an arrow. 

Scarlett immediately flagged down a car and ordered the driver to stay right on his tail. 

The vehicles finally stopped outside an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. 

Ethan rushed inside with his aide on his heels, and Scarlett slipped in after them, keeping to the shadows. 

Inside the warehouse, a wild–eyed kidnapper was holding a knife to a young woman’s throat. 

The girl was wearing a simple, elegant dress and was sobbing so hard she looked heartbreakin like she might faint at any second.

The moment Ethan saw her, his face darkened, and his voice held a barely noticeable tremor. Let her go.” 

The kidnapper let out an ugly laugh. “Knew I picked the right target! Ethan, everyone out there says you spoil that out–of–control wife of yours, Scarlett, but I’m the only one who knows the person you really keep at the center of your world is her–Nora West.” 

Nora West? Scarlett’s heart dropped like a stone. 

The kidnapper kept shouting, “On that last border mission, because of you, my guys ended up dead or maimed! Today, I’m going to make you feel what it’s like to lose the person you love most!” 

The veins on the back of Ethan’s hand stood out, but his voice stayed as steady as he could make it. “I’m the one you want. Let her go and take it out on me.” 

“Let her go? Sure.” The kidnapper kicked a knife across the floor, the blade flashing coldly as it skidded to a stop at Ethan’s feet. “Stab yourself in the chest. Then I’ll think about letting her walk.” 

“No! Ethan, don’t!” Nora wailed, shaking her head as tears streamed down her face. 

Ethan held her gaze for a long, deep second, and the look in his eyes was so full of feeling that Scarlett realized she had never once seen him look at her that way. 

Then he bent, scooped up the knife, and drove it into his own chest without a moment’s hesitation. 

In the shadows, Scarlett dug her nails so hard into her palms that she nearly broke the skin, and it was the only thing that kept her from screaming. 

He could actually try to kill himself–without hesitation–for another woman. ",1,1766210172.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

Madison Shaw had learned one hard truth early in life, her face was a magnet for trouble. 

From a young age, her striking looks made her a magnet for trouble, attracting a constant stream of 

unwanted attention. 

By the time she turned eighteen and was ready for college, the lifelong “good girl” had finally had enough. 

She made a radical decision. Hiring a professional makeup artist, she commissioned a custom 

“ugly” transformation, a meticulously crafted disguise that effectively concealed her striking beauty beneath layers of artificial plainness. 

Leaving her identity as the Shaw family heiress behind, she set off for Northwood University alone, 

determined to build a normal life. 

For two blissful years, the strategy worked perfectly. Shielded by her plain-Jane persona, Madison enjoyed the peaceful anonymity she’d always craved, free from the complications her looks usually brought. 

That all changed on a Christmas Eve during her sophomore year. While celebrating at a bar with her roommate, Madison watched in dismay as a group of guys began aggressively harassing her pretty friend, their hands wandering where they weren’t welcome. 

Madison’s temper flared. Stepping forward despite her pounding heart, she positioned herself between her friend and the harassers. 

“Hey! What do you think you’re doing?” she challenged, her voice cutting through the noise. “Can’t you hear my friend saying she doesn’t want to talk to you?” 

One of the men turned his contemptuous gaze on her, shoving her aside with a rough, dismissive hand. “Back off, ugly,” he sneered. “We weren’t hitting on you. Why are you butting in?” 

The force sent her stumbling backward, right into the solid, unexpected support of a stranger’s 

arms. 

As she regained her balance and looked up, her breath caught. The man holding her was ridiculously handsome, with features so perfectly sculpted they seemed almost unreal. He stood a head taller, all long limbs and lean strength, and as he glanced down at her, one eyebrow arched in curious amusement. 

“What’s going on here?” His voice was as captivating as his appearance, though it carried a lazy, almost bored drawl. 

He gave her a slow, appraising look. “Since when do they let minors into bars?” 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

Madison was dazed for a long moment before she managed to stammer, “I’m 21… I 

I just…” 

I just look young, she meant to say. 

But before she could finish, the man suddenly leaned in, closing the distance between them in an 

instant. 

Madison could even see the reflection of the fake freckles on her face in his pupils. 

“You look familiar,” he muttered to himself. “Do you go to Northwood University?” 

Madison nodded instinctively. She saw the corner of his mouth quirk up. 

“So you’re my junior then.” He straightened up and looked at the troublemakers, his smile casual and unconcerned. “You’ve got some nerve, picking on my junior.” 

The previously arrogant guys instantly paled. “Mr. Quinn… we didn’t know she was with you…”, then they turned and fled in a panic. 

Madison only pieced it together later, the man who’d stepped in was none other than Ethan Quinn, the trust-fund baby whose reputation for trouble was the stuff of walking legend all over Northwood’s coffee shops and fraternity houses. 

He was recklessness personified, a slave to his own whims with a reputation for chaos that trailed 

him like a shadow. 

People said if he woke up and decided he wanted the moon, he wouldn’t just try to buy it, he’d probably figure out how to pull it down from the sky himself, just to prove a point. 

But two years ago, for reasons no one understood, he’d suddenly donated a building to Northwood University and even enrolled as a graduate student. 

He rarely attended classes, just occasionally roared past campus in various luxury sports cars. Yet, despite all that, his face alone was enough to attract countless female admirers at school. 

Rumor had it the girls who had a crush on him could form a line that circled the library ten times over. There were even stories of girls attempting suicide over him. 

The moment the New Year’s countdown bells rang, Madison suddenly realized, She was about to become one of them. For the first time in her life, Madison had a crush on someone. 

From that day on, she’d bring him breakfast and even custom-ordered a spirit shirt from the campus print shop with his last name and jersey number, leaving it anonymously in his locker. 

During one of his basketball games, she sneakily put a carton of milk in his bag, only to be caught 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

red-handed by him and his friends. 

His friends burst into laughter. One, feeling slightly sympathetic, reminded her, “Hey, Freckles, our man Ethan doesn’t drink matcha…” 

But before the words fully left his mouth, they watched in shock as Ethan picked up the matcha milk Madison had given him and drank every last drop. 

Then he leaned close to Madison’s ear, his voice low. “I prefer strawberry flavour.” 

He caught the faint scent of strawberry body wash from her skin and chuckled softly. “Something that smells like you.” 

Madison’s heart slammed against her ribs. Looking into the man’s teasing, half-smiling eyes, she 

knew she was a goner. 

On Valentine’s Day, Madison finally mustered the courage to confess her feelings to Ethan. 

She had assumed a boring girl like her would definitely be rejected. Ethan might seem carefree and irreverent, but in two years, he had never agreed to date any woman. 

To her surprise, Ethan spoke slowly and deliberately, “Madison, being with me means you’ll 

become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you… willing to accept that?” 

Madison was stunned for a second, then her heart exploded with joy, mirroring the fireworks 

blooming overhead. “I… I am willing!” 

Madison originally thought Ethan’s question was just a casual remark. But she never expected that 

after they started dating, her assignments would be torn up, her locker spray-painted, and girls 

who liked Ethan would trip her in the cafeteria. 

Having grown up sheltered and protected by the Shaw family, Madison was obedient and naive, completely unprepared for this kind of treatment. 

Now, she faced daily harassment. The worst incident was when she was kidnapped by Ethan’s 

enemies and locked in a warehouse for a full day and night. 

After she was safe, Ethan pressed a kiss to her forehead, his voice a low murmur. “I’m sorry you 

went through that, Maddie.” 

And just like that, every moment of fear and uncertainty stilled. In that single sentence, she found a 

gentle anchor, and the world felt right again. 

Until, just before graduation, the most sought-after girl in the Advertising Department was thrown 

into the campus lake. 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

Madison followed the crowd to the lake’s edge, only to see Ethan, acting like a madman, brutally beating a man on the ground. 

His eyes were bloodshot, the usual playful arrogance on his face replaced by pure fury. “I told you! Stay away from Chloe Grant! Are you deaf?!” 

Chloe Grant, the most sought-after girl of their department. 

Ethan only stopped punching when the man’s face was a bloody mess. Then he scooped Chloe up into his arms and carried her away. As the man passed by Madison, she managed a weak, “Ethan…” 

But he didn’t even glance her way. 

The crowd of onlookers soon dispersed, but Madison stood there, frozen in place. She walked over to the beaten, bruised man and asked softly, “Why…?” 

The man forced his eyes open, recognized Madison, and let out a low laugh. “You’re the new girlfriend Ethan’s seeing? You want to know why I went after Chloe Grant?” 

He sneered, intense hatred flashing in his eyes. “Because my sister killed herself over Ethan Quinn! So I’m going to torment the woman he loves for revenge!” 

“And the woman Ethan Quinn loves is Chloe Grant! Why else do you think a spoiled rich brat like him would come study at Northwood? He followed her here because he fell for her at first sight!” 

“But too many girls like him, and he’s pissed off too many people. Everyone targeted Chloe for revenge. She was harassed so badly she had to take a year off, developed depression, and that’s why they broke up.” 

“As for you…” The guy gave Madison a scornful look. 

“A plain Jane like you… you don’t actually think Ethan likes you, do you? Let’s be real. You’re just a decoy he found to draw fire away from his real girlfriend.” 

Madison’s face instantly lost all color. She remembered the day she confessed, when Ethan had asked her, “Being with me means you’ll become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you willing to accept that?” 

So… so that was what he meant. He was never worried about her getting hurt. He wanted her to be a 

human shield for the girl he truly loved. 

Madison had no idea how she made it back to her dorm. She threw away her umbrella and walked through the pouring rain, her waterproof makeup streaking and washing away. 

When she finally reached her dorm entrance, just as she was about to go inside, “Madison?” 

Chapter 1

A familiar male voice rang out. She turned and saw Ethan standing under her dorm window, apparently waiting for her. Before Madison could say anything, Ethan spoke first, looking stunned. 

“Madison, your face…”

flair for drama. 

In the year she was partying hardest overseas, her father yanked her back home with an overnight express letter marked URGENT. It held only one cold line: \[Come home at once. Marry Ethan Foster.\] 

Ethan Foster was the youngest rising star on the base–cool, restrained, almost ascetic, rigidly 

self–disciplined, the complete opposite of her in every way. 

She thrived on noise and crowds; he preferred quiet and order. 

She did whatever she liked and had a long history of reckless stunts, while he followed every rule to the 

letter, treating discipline like something carved in stone. 

She was bright and free–spirited, changing boyfriends the way other people changed clothes, and he was infamous for avoiding women altogether, never even brushing the hand of a female soldier under his 

command. 

Just thinking about marrying a man so straight–laced made her feel like she couldn’t breathe. 

So, determined to blow up the wedding, Scarlett threw everything she had at the problem. 

She partied and danced for three straight nights at a downtown club, hoping he’d finally back off, but he 

showed up in full dress uniform, and under all the curious stares, he calmly slung her onto his back and 

carried her home. 

She deliberately crashed into the base commander’s front–yard fence, wanting him to see how outrageous 

she could be, but he went over in person to apologize, paid for the repairs, and buried the whole thing before 

it could spread. 

She charged forward raising hell without a care, and he was always right behind her, quietly cleaning up 

whatever mess she left in her wake. 

This time, she’d gotten into another fight and was being held at the station. He had just finished a three–day emergency mission when he rushed over to bail her out, still in uniform, his eyes bloodshot with exhaustion. 

Looking at his tired but ramrod–straight back, Scarlett felt a rare urge to explain herself. 

She wanted to say that this time she wasn’t the one causing trouble, that the other guy had made a move on 

her first because he thought she was pretty, but before she could get the words out, Ethan was already in 

front of her, gently taking her hand. 

There was a tiny cut on the tip of her finger, something she hadn’t even noticed, and he pulled a small

first–aid kit from his uniform pocket, lowered his head, disinfected the wound, and pressed a bandage over it. 

“Does it hurt?” he asked. 

In that moment, every excuse and argument Scarlett had prepared jammed in her throat. 

He lifted his gaze, his eyes steady. “I don’t care how much trouble you cause or how big a mess you make. I 

can handle all of that. The only thing I care about is whether this–right here–hurts.” 

Does this hurt… 

Scarlett’s heart lurched, as if something had slammed into the softest part of her chest, shatter 

one of her defenses in an instant. 

✓ last 

All her life, whenever she got into trouble, her father only shouted about how embarrassing she was, and her stepmother only put on a fake show of telling her to act like a lady, but not once had anyone ever asked her 

if she was hurt, or if she felt wronged. 

With her voice gone hoarse, she heard herself say, “Ethan, we can get married.” 

Something like a flicker of light passed through his dark eyes. 

“But before that, I need to ask you something,” she pressed, her pride and possessiveness sharpening her tone. “Do you have anyone you’ve ever loved and couldn’t have? My man has to belong to me completely. He doesn’t get to have anyone else in his heart–past, present, or future. It can only be me.” 

Ethan’s gaze locked onto hers, heavy and unwavering. “No. Only you.” 

So Scarlett married him. 

Southport’s wildest red rose married the coldest, most untouchable officer in the entire military. 

After the wedding, one line started making the rounds in Southport’s upper circles. 

Of all the people you could mess with, don’t you dare mess with General Foster’s wife, Scarlett Jones. 

Because no matter how big a mess she made, that stone–faced grim reaper of a general would still be right behind her, always having her back and keeping the world from crashing down on her. 

Scarlett honestly believed that she’d melted that block of ice with her fire. 

Right up until the day she went out to the base to drop off some files Ethan had forgotten at home. 

As she reached the training grounds, she saw a cluster of officers gathered together in what looked like some sort of mixer, where the mood was loud and lively. 

Chanter 1

Ethan was surrounded by a few fellow officers, and it looked like he’d just lost a game and was being pushed into answering one of those truth–or–dare questions. 

Someone called out, loud and clear, “General Foster, come on–what’s the biggest lie you’ve ever told in your 

life?” 

The noise around them dipped, the group settling down as everyone turned to watch the commanding officer who was known for being rigidly honest. 

Ethan was silent for a moment, his profile shadowed and hard under the lights, and then he picked up the coffee mug in front of him, took a sip, and finally spoke, his voice low but clear enough to carry right to 

where Scarlett had just stepped into the doorway. 

“Someone once asked me if I had someone I loved and couldn’t have.” 

“I lied and told her no.” 

It was like a thunderclap going off inside her head. 

Scarlett froze where she stood, every drop of blood in her body turning to ice. 

He’d lied? 

He had someone he loved and couldn’t have? 

Then why had he told her he didn’t? 

Why had he married her at all? 

A chill shot up from the soles of her feet and raced through her entire body, leaving her feeling like she’d been dropped into a block of ice, her limbs shaking from the cold. 

She was just about to storm over and demand an answer when one of his aides hurried to Ethan’s side and murmured something in his ear. 

Ethan’s usually composed face changed in an instant. 

He shot to his feet so fast he didn’t even pause to explain to anyone, snatched his uniform jacket from the back of his chair, and headed for the door, moving so quickly he left a gust of air in his wake. 

He didn’t even notice her standing right there in the doorway. 

As he barreled past, his shoulder slammed hard into hers, and he didn’t react at all, like every sense he had was locked onto a single target up ahead. 

Scarlett staggered from the hit, pain flaring in her shoulder, but the ache in her chest was even worse.

She swallowed the pain and the roiling questions in her gut and found herself following after him on instinct. 

She watched Ethan jump into a Jeep, the engine roaring to life before it shot out of the lot like an arrow. 

Scarlett immediately flagged down a car and ordered the driver to stay right on his tail. 

The vehicles finally stopped outside an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. 

Ethan rushed inside with his aide on his heels, and Scarlett slipped in after them, keeping to the shadows. 

Inside the warehouse, a wild–eyed kidnapper was holding a knife to a young woman’s throat. 

The girl was wearing a simple, elegant dress and was sobbing so hard she looked heartbreakin like she might faint at any second.

The moment Ethan saw her, his face darkened, and his voice held a barely noticeable tremor. Let her go.” 

The kidnapper let out an ugly laugh. “Knew I picked the right target! Ethan, everyone out there says you spoil that out–of–control wife of yours, Scarlett, but I’m the only one who knows the person you really keep at the center of your world is her–Nora West.” 

Nora West? Scarlett’s heart dropped like a stone. 

The kidnapper kept shouting, “On that last border mission, because of you, my guys ended up dead or maimed! Today, I’m going to make you feel what it’s like to lose the person you love most!” 

The veins on the back of Ethan’s hand stood out, but his voice stayed as steady as he could make it. “I’m the one you want. Let her go and take it out on me.” 

“Let her go? Sure.” The kidnapper kicked a knife across the floor, the blade flashing coldly as it skidded to a stop at Ethan’s feet. “Stab yourself in the chest. Then I’ll think about letting her walk.” 

“No! Ethan, don’t!” Nora wailed, shaking her head as tears streamed down her face. 

Ethan held her gaze for a long, deep second, and the look in his eyes was so full of feeling that Scarlett realized she had never once seen him look at her that way. 

Then he bent, scooped up the knife, and drove it into his own chest without a moment’s hesitation. 

In the shadows, Scarlett dug her nails so hard into her palms that she nearly broke the skin, and it was the only thing that kept her from screaming. 

He could actually try to kill himself–without hesitation–for another woman. ",1,1766209629.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

Madison Shaw had learned one hard truth early in life, her face was a magnet for trouble. 

From a young age, her striking looks made her a magnet for trouble, attracting a constant stream of 

unwanted attention. 

By the time she turned eighteen and was ready for college, the lifelong “good girl” had finally had enough. 

She made a radical decision. Hiring a professional makeup artist, she commissioned a custom 

“ugly” transformation, a meticulously crafted disguise that effectively concealed her striking beauty beneath layers of artificial plainness. 

Leaving her identity as the Shaw family heiress behind, she set off for Northwood University alone, 

determined to build a normal life. 

For two blissful years, the strategy worked perfectly. Shielded by her plain-Jane persona, Madison enjoyed the peaceful anonymity she’d always craved, free from the complications her looks usually brought. 

That all changed on a Christmas Eve during her sophomore year. While celebrating at a bar with her roommate, Madison watched in dismay as a group of guys began aggressively harassing her pretty friend, their hands wandering where they weren’t welcome. 

Madison’s temper flared. Stepping forward despite her pounding heart, she positioned herself between her friend and the harassers. 

“Hey! What do you think you’re doing?” she challenged, her voice cutting through the noise. “Can’t you hear my friend saying she doesn’t want to talk to you?” 

One of the men turned his contemptuous gaze on her, shoving her aside with a rough, dismissive hand. “Back off, ugly,” he sneered. “We weren’t hitting on you. Why are you butting in?” 

The force sent her stumbling backward, right into the solid, unexpected support of a stranger’s 

arms. 

As she regained her balance and looked up, her breath caught. The man holding her was ridiculously handsome, with features so perfectly sculpted they seemed almost unreal. He stood a head taller, all long limbs and lean strength, and as he glanced down at her, one eyebrow arched in curious amusement. 

“What’s going on here?” His voice was as captivating as his appearance, though it carried a lazy, almost bored drawl. 

He gave her a slow, appraising look. “Since when do they let minors into bars?” 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

Madison was dazed for a long moment before she managed to stammer, “I’m 21… I 

I just…” 

I just look young, she meant to say. 

But before she could finish, the man suddenly leaned in, closing the distance between them in an 

instant. 

Madison could even see the reflection of the fake freckles on her face in his pupils. 

“You look familiar,” he muttered to himself. “Do you go to Northwood University?” 

Madison nodded instinctively. She saw the corner of his mouth quirk up. 

“So you’re my junior then.” He straightened up and looked at the troublemakers, his smile casual and unconcerned. “You’ve got some nerve, picking on my junior.” 

The previously arrogant guys instantly paled. “Mr. Quinn… we didn’t know she was with you…”, then they turned and fled in a panic. 

Madison only pieced it together later, the man who’d stepped in was none other than Ethan Quinn, the trust-fund baby whose reputation for trouble was the stuff of walking legend all over Northwood’s coffee shops and fraternity houses. 

He was recklessness personified, a slave to his own whims with a reputation for chaos that trailed 

him like a shadow. 

People said if he woke up and decided he wanted the moon, he wouldn’t just try to buy it, he’d probably figure out how to pull it down from the sky himself, just to prove a point. 

But two years ago, for reasons no one understood, he’d suddenly donated a building to Northwood University and even enrolled as a graduate student. 

He rarely attended classes, just occasionally roared past campus in various luxury sports cars. Yet, despite all that, his face alone was enough to attract countless female admirers at school. 

Rumor had it the girls who had a crush on him could form a line that circled the library ten times over. There were even stories of girls attempting suicide over him. 

The moment the New Year’s countdown bells rang, Madison suddenly realized, She was about to become one of them. For the first time in her life, Madison had a crush on someone. 

From that day on, she’d bring him breakfast and even custom-ordered a spirit shirt from the campus print shop with his last name and jersey number, leaving it anonymously in his locker. 

During one of his basketball games, she sneakily put a carton of milk in his bag, only to be caught

red-handed by him and his friends. 

His friends burst into laughter. One, feeling slightly sympathetic, reminded her, “Hey, Freckles, our man Ethan doesn’t drink matcha…” 

But before the words fully left his mouth, they watched in shock as Ethan picked up the matcha milk Madison had given him and drank every last drop. 

Then he leaned close to Madison’s ear, his voice low. “I prefer strawberry flavour.” 

He caught the faint scent of strawberry body wash from her skin and chuckled softly. “Something that smells like you.” 

Madison’s heart slammed against her ribs. Looking into the man’s teasing, half-smiling eyes, she 

knew she was a goner. 

On Valentine’s Day, Madison finally mustered the courage to confess her feelings to Ethan. 

She had assumed a boring girl like her would definitely be rejected. Ethan might seem carefree and irreverent, but in two years, he had never agreed to date any woman. 

To her surprise, Ethan spoke slowly and deliberately, “Madison, being with me means you’ll 

become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you… willing to accept that?” 

Madison was stunned for a second, then her heart exploded with joy, mirroring the fireworks 

blooming overhead. “I… I am willing!” 

Madison originally thought Ethan’s question was just a casual remark. But she never expected that 

after they started dating, her assignments would be torn up, her locker spray-painted, and girls 

who liked Ethan would trip her in the cafeteria. 

Having grown up sheltered and protected by the Shaw family, Madison was obedient and naive, completely unprepared for this kind of treatment. 

Now, she faced daily harassment. The worst incident was when she was kidnapped by Ethan’s 

enemies and locked in a warehouse for a full day and night. 

After she was safe, Ethan pressed a kiss to her forehead, his voice a low murmur. “I’m sorry you 

went through that, Maddie.” 

And just like that, every moment of fear and uncertainty stilled. In that single sentence, she found a 

gentle anchor, and the world felt right again. 

Until, just before graduation, the most sought-after girl in the Advertising Department was thrown 

into the campus lake. 

Chapter 1 

4.17% 

Madison followed the crowd to the lake’s edge, only to see Ethan, acting like a madman, brutally beating a man on the ground. 

His eyes were bloodshot, the usual playful arrogance on his face replaced by pure fury. “I told you! Stay away from Chloe Grant! Are you deaf?!” 

Chloe Grant, the most sought-after girl of their department. 

Ethan only stopped punching when the man’s face was a bloody mess. Then he scooped Chloe up into his arms and carried her away. As the man passed by Madison, she managed a weak, “Ethan…” 

But he didn’t even glance her way. 

The crowd of onlookers soon dispersed, but Madison stood there, frozen in place. She walked over to the beaten, bruised man and asked softly, “Why…?” 

The man forced his eyes open, recognized Madison, and let out a low laugh. “You’re the new girlfriend Ethan’s seeing? You want to know why I went after Chloe Grant?” 

He sneered, intense hatred flashing in his eyes. “Because my sister killed herself over Ethan Quinn! So I’m going to torment the woman he loves for revenge!” 

“And the woman Ethan Quinn loves is Chloe Grant! Why else do you think a spoiled rich brat like him would come study at Northwood? He followed her here because he fell for her at first sight!” 

“But too many girls like him, and he’s pissed off too many people. Everyone targeted Chloe for revenge. She was harassed so badly she had to take a year off, developed depression, and that’s why they broke up.” 

“As for you…” The guy gave Madison a scornful look. 

“A plain Jane like you… you don’t actually think Ethan likes you, do you? Let’s be real. You’re just a decoy he found to draw fire away from his real girlfriend.” 

Madison’s face instantly lost all color. She remembered the day she confessed, when Ethan had asked her, “Being with me means you’ll become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you willing to accept that?” 

So… so that was what he meant. He was never worried about her getting hurt. He wanted her to be a 

human shield for the girl he truly loved. 

Madison had no idea how she made it back to her dorm. She threw away her umbrella and walked through the pouring rain, her waterproof makeup streaking and washing away. 

When she finally reached her dorm entrance, just as she was about to go inside, “Madison?”

A familiar male voice rang out. She turned and saw Ethan standing under her dorm window, apparently waiting for her. Before Madison could say anything, Ethan spoke first, looking stunned.

Madison nodded instinctively. She saw the corner of his mouth quirk up. 

“So you’re my junior then.” He straightened up and looked at the troublemakers, his smile casual and unconcerned. “You’ve got some nerve, picking on my junior.” 

The previously arrogant guys instantly paled. “Mr. Quinn… we didn’t know she was with you…”, then they turned and fled in a panic. 

Madison only pieced it together later, the man who’d stepped in was none other than Ethan Quinn, the trust-fund baby whose reputation for trouble was the stuff of walking legend all over Northwood’s coffee shops and fraternity houses. 

He was recklessness personified, a slave to his own whims with a reputation for chaos that trailed 

him like a shadow. 

People said if he woke up and decided he wanted the moon, he wouldn’t just try to buy it, he’d probably figure out how to pull it down from the sky himself, just to prove a point. 

But two years ago, for reasons no one understood, he’d suddenly donated a building to Northwood University and even enrolled as a graduate student. 

He rarely attended classes, just occasionally roared past campus in various luxury sports cars. Yet, despite all that, his face alone was enough to attract countless female admirers at school. 

Rumor had it the girls who had a crush on him could form a line that circled the library ten times over. There were even stories of girls attempting suicide over him. 

The moment the New Year’s countdown bells rang, Madison suddenly realized, She was about to become one of them. For the first time in her life, Madison had a crush on someone. 

From that day on, she’d bring him breakfast and even custom-ordered a spirit shirt from the campus print shop with his last name and jersey number, leaving it anonymously in his locker. 

During one of his basketball games, she sneakily put a carton of milk in his bag, only to be caught

red-handed by him and his friends. 

His friends burst into laughter. One, feeling slightly sympathetic, reminded her, “Hey, Freckles, our man Ethan doesn’t drink matcha…” 

But before the words fully left his mouth, they watched in shock as Ethan picked up the matcha milk Madison had given him and drank every last drop. 

Then he leaned close to Madison’s ear, his voice low. “I prefer strawberry flavour.” 

He caught the faint scent of strawberry body wash from her skin and chuckled softly. “Something that smells like you.” 

Madison’s heart slammed against her ribs. Looking into the man’s teasing, half-smiling eyes, she 

knew she was a goner. 

On Valentine’s Day, Madison finally mustered the courage to confess her feelings to Ethan. 

She had assumed a boring girl like her would definitely be rejected. Ethan might seem carefree and irreverent, but in two years, he had never agreed to date any woman. 

To her surprise, Ethan spoke slowly and deliberately, “Madison, being with me means you’ll 

become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you… willing to accept that?” 

Madison was stunned for a second, then her heart exploded with joy, mirroring the fireworks 

blooming overhead. “I… I am willing!” 

Madison originally thought Ethan’s question was just a casual remark. But she never expected that 

after they started dating, her assignments would be torn up, her locker spray-painted, and girls 

who liked Ethan would trip her in the cafeteria. 

Having grown up sheltered and protected by the Shaw family, Madison was obedient and naive, completely unprepared for this kind of treatment. 

Now, she faced daily harassment. The worst incident was when she was kidnapped by Ethan’s 

enemies and locked in a warehouse for a full day and night. 

After she was safe, Ethan pressed a kiss to her forehead, his voice a low murmur. “I’m sorry you 

went through that, Maddie.” 

And just like that, every moment of fear and uncertainty stilled. In that single sentence, she found a 

gentle anchor, and the world felt right again. 

Until, just before graduation, the most sought-after girl in the Advertising Department was thrown 

into the campus lake. 

Chapter 1

Madison followed the crowd to the lake’s edge, only to see Ethan, acting like a madman, brutally beating a man on the ground. 

His eyes were bloodshot, the usual playful arrogance on his face replaced by pure fury. “I told you! Stay away from Chloe Grant! Are you deaf?!” 

Chloe Grant, the most sought-after girl of their department. 

Ethan only stopped punching when the man’s face was a bloody mess. Then he scooped Chloe up into his arms and carried her away. As the man passed by Madison, she managed a weak, “Ethan…” 

But he didn’t even glance her way. 

The crowd of onlookers soon dispersed, but Madison stood there, frozen in place. She walked over to the beaten, bruised man and asked softly, “Why…?” 

The man forced his eyes open, recognized Madison, and let out a low laugh. “You’re the new girlfriend Ethan’s seeing? You want to know why I went after Chloe Grant?” 

He sneered, intense hatred flashing in his eyes. “Because my sister killed herself over Ethan Quinn! So I’m going to torment the woman he loves for revenge!” 

“And the woman Ethan Quinn loves is Chloe Grant! Why else do you think a spoiled rich brat like him would come study at Northwood? He followed her here because he fell for her at first sight!” 

“But too many girls like him, and he’s pissed off too many people. Everyone targeted Chloe for revenge. She was harassed so badly she had to take a year off, developed depression, and that’s why they broke up.” 

“As for you…” The guy gave Madison a scornful look. 

“A plain Jane like you… you don’t actually think Ethan likes you, do you? Let’s be real. You’re just a decoy he found to draw fire away from his real girlfriend.” 

Madison’s face instantly lost all color. She remembered the day she confessed, when Ethan had asked her, “Being with me means you’ll become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you willing to accept that?” 

So… so that was what he meant. He was never worried about her getting hurt. He wanted her to be a 

human shield for the girl he truly loved. 

Madison had no idea how she made it back to her dorm. She threw away her umbrella and walked through the pouring rain, her waterproof makeup streaking and washing away. 

When she finally reached her dorm entrance, just as she was about to go inside, “Madison?” 

Chapter 1

A familiar male voice rang out. She turned and saw Ethan standing under her dorm window, apparently waiting for her. Before Madison could say anything, Ethan spoke first, looking stunned. 

“Madison, your face…”

Chapter 26

When Hernandez knocked White was with her. White was smaller than Tyrdottir but still a little on the tall side for normal people. She came in around six feet tall, well muscled, ebony skin, and curly black hair. I had been expecting white. What I was not expecting were her three tagalongs. Nessi, Asher, and Mara were with her.

“That is more company than I was expecting.” I kept my voice even.

I did not hate the girls but for some reason every single time I ran into them there was some sort of trouble. I was starting to think they were cursed or something of that nature. Maybe Nessi had a secondary power that caused terrible misfortune around her or something of that nature?

“Ran into the kids on the way here sir. They were on their way to a study session and Pantheon said you were some sort of super genius. I thought maybe you could help them? Two of them are looking at having to retake a few classes if they do not shape up.” She said as she thumbed to the Trio.

That caused me to raise an eyebrow. “Which two?” I asked, looking over the pair. I could see Nessi failing out. She did not strike me as the sort who did well academically. She acted more on emotion than anything else. 

“I’m passing.” Nessi immediately blushed as she squeaked the words out.

That got a rise out of the other two girls, Asher punching Nessi in the thigh and Mara putting a finger to her lips. After looking at them for a long moment I knew that Nessi was not lying. That was.. well.. It was something I just didn’t expect.

I sighed and opened my door inviting them in. I had tidied up and gotten dressed in something relaxed but a little more casual. Sweat pants, tank top under shirt, then a loose over shirt with no sleeves.

“Shoes off at the door.” I said pointing at a little shelf I had requisitioned the other day along with a number of pillows. “I only make an exception for on duty soldiers.”

The girls complied and I headed to the living room. I had a small coffee table that I had pulled closer to the oversized couch to eat on. It was tall enough to almost be a normal table for most people. With more guests than were expected I looked at the sergeant and White and asked, “Folding chairs?”

“On it sir.” White said, pretty much sprinting out of the room. She was a specialist under Hernandez, and the unit’s medic.

“Good motivation in her.” I commented as I went to take a seat.

“Yeah, she’s the one that does not give me any trouble. I expect she will be heading to the panel inside a year and it will be sergeant White soon enough.” She said with a shrug as she brought a box in and started to set out the to go boxes from the mess. “Don’t tell her I said that.” She finished with a laugh.

White was back soon enough with the chairs and setting them out. She had grabbed enough for everyone to sit. I stopped her when she went to set them all out.

“I’ll take the chair. You soldiers and Nessi get the couch. It’s large enough for all of you and faces the television. The other two get folding chairs and they will be facing the couch.” I added an edge of firmness to my voice.

“How is that fair?” It seemed that really did not stop Asher from arguing.

“People who are passing their classes get to watch television with comfortable seats. Pull up your grade average and you get to sit on the couch next time.” I shook my head as I sat with my meal. Fortunately the chair had a little side table.

With the two in their folding chairs and the three girls pulling out their homework I took the opportunity to look over what books were being pulled out.

“I did not expect Nessi to be the sort to study hard, why are you two failing?” I asked.

“Hey! I’m smart. I just get excited easily.” Nessi huffed and crossed her arms.

“Yeah, it’s a little frustrating but Nessi has never had trouble with grades. She gets bored easily so homework can be a problem but for some reason she always aces every test she gets.” Asher said, running her hands through her hair. “For me getting the answers easy, but they want me to show you the work and fuck if I know how I got the answer. Mara on the other hand spends all of her time boy-chasing.” She said, thumbing to the blue girl.

Mara blushed a deep blue. “I- What- No! That is-.. I mean…” She started to rub her legs and looked to the side. “It’s not my fault if one or two of the boys on the base are showing me attention.” Then she muttered almost under her breath. “They never gave me the time of day before I got my powers.”

She had struck me as a little more innocent than that at first. I supposed you could not judge a book by its cover.

“What are your powers anyway?” I asked as I pulled the chair closer to the table and grabbed one of Asher’s work sheets to look it over. It looked to be algebra around the level that I would consider early college. I knew what their powers were, but this was a good excuse to be told so it was not suspicious.

“Hydrokenisis! I control liquid. I sort of need a water source rather than generating it. Strong enough to punch through car doors down at the junk yard though!” Nessi sounded rather proud of that.

“I remember. You used water to catch me.” I said with a soft chuckle. “Thanks for letting me avoid breaking a leg, awkward conversation with the lions or not.”

That turned two of them red and left the other one confused and looking between the pair like she really wanted to know but was terrified to ask.

“I uh… Make barriers?” When she finally decided to speak I could see that she wanted to ask something but did not have the courage. She decided to let the statement die there.

Asher scoffed. “She’s being modest. She makes extra dimensional space barriers. No one knows how to break them and she can make them inside of things which cut those things in half.”

“They said that I umm.. c-could be a Celestial if I get good at it.. and uh, do good in my career.” She put her hands together as she looked down at her work. She wanted praise for that but was afraid to ask for it.

“Impressive.” Both eyebrows went up at that. “I Imagine that puts you up there with a lot of the untouchable and absolute powers.” 

“N-not that impressive sir. I’m uh, working on my speed. Right now it takes five seconds per foot.” She grumbled into her homework. 

“If the speed is increasing that means you will improve. It means that my power will do nothing against you eventually.” I put Asher’s paper back.

“I have you all beat. I can make things that aren’t possible.” She grinned as she looked down at her paperwork. “I got in here because I made a camo suit that projects what is behind it in front of it and the opposite way around. It just sucks that it was easier than this homework.” She grumbled towards the end of her words.

“Using something you do not understand is a good way to die.” It was meant to be an idle comment but Asher snapped at that.

“I know! Dammit, that stupid old lady already threatened me with that. Showed me how their stupid standard rifle shoots bullets for some Vulcan cannon for planes.” I had never looked too closely at the standard rifle of a Guardian, most of them walk around the base interior with just pistols. It was good to know. “Some crafter who is supposedly better than me made the recoil system or something stupid like that.”

“Charming.” It was interesting how letting a single word hang in the air could stammer someone. She didn’t look at me. “No one starts off knowing everything. This Crafter probably just studied a bit more than you and has been at it longer. You can catch up.”

“Goddess you sound like my grandmother.” She grumbled.

Nessi kicked the table and shot Asher a look. Something that caused the girl to huff and look away from her as well. 

Meanwhile White was just relaxed and watching the television as Hernandez flipped through channels as she had commandeered the remote. It did not really help that she cackled under her breath every time she pressed one of the oversized buttons, holding the remote sized for me out in front of her with both arms. This caught on with White who was joining in giggling in unison with her cackles.

Well no, that is a lie. It helped a lot. I wanted to strangle the teen aged drama in front of me. Having two grown women on the couch next to them acting admittedly a little immature in the way that was actually endearing took the edge off things.

I let out a heavy breath.

“Let’s get back on track. What exactly is it you are having problems with?” I asked towards Asher.

“They want me to write out all of the steps to my answers and tell them where I got them. It’s stupid honestly. I got the answer so what is the big deal?” Then she glared at me and blurted out unprompted, “I am -not- cheating.”

“I can see why they would think that.” I shrugged. “But, I do not think that is it. I guess I should address something first. When you are learning, getting the right answer is important, but it’s a lot less important than understanding how you got it.”

“That’s stupid. I got the right answer, that’s what they are asking for. The rest should not matter.”

“Sure it does. You are only getting the right answers now by just looking at things because you are smart. It’s not challenging enough for you to see the problem yet. When you get onto the more advanced stuff, if you do not have a base of knowing -how- to get the answer, and you cannot just look at it and see the answer, you are going to be stranded. They are trying to save you from that.”

One of the big problems for gifted kids in society is that people do not really know how to handle something out of the average, be it above or below it. I had not really taken Nessi for one, but it seemed Asher and her were not lying. A lot of what was described sounded like someone smart, but also with focus problems. 

Meanwhile Asher was smart enough to have just disregarded the work in favor of the answers. It was pretty common in lower grades for a lot of teachers to just be happy their students got it right and not push farther than that.

“So.. they are trying to prepare me for harder stuff with simple stuff?” She raised her eyebrow at me.

“Crawl, walk, run. Those are generally the three steps people go in. You never learned to crawl and just started walking. So now when you need to do that in order to get started all you know how to do is walk.” I set my food to the side and folded my hands in my lap leaning forward. “Let me show you.”

I held out a hand and pointed at the paper and pencils and then turned my palm up. She obliged me and got me something to write with. I was in calculus and trigonometry myself, but I was not much of a teacher or test maker. I just made something a little more complicated than what she was used to but not so much so that I would struggle with it myself.

When I handed her the paper she knit her brow at the equation on it.

“What is this?” She asked, confused.

“It’s the math I am at right now. You probably recognize some of what is in there, and can probably even solve some of the steps in the problem. That is the thing, it has to be taken in steps. That is why they want you to write your work out now. If you know how to separate things into steps at your level, when you get to my level it’s not a matter of -if- you get the right answer or not. It’s a matter of how long.” I set the pencil to the side for now.

“Why wouldn’t they just say so then? All they ever do is yell at me that it’s something I have to do.” The paper started to fold where she gripped it.

“Teachers are pretty bogged down. They have to teach what? Thirty or forty kids at once. They make crap pay, and they work hours more in the day than they spend with you. Unless you get a really good one they are not going to spot the difference between a gifted kid and a troublemaker. When you are younger they are just going to be happy you got the answer right. When you finally get to where you are struggling they are going to see you as disobedient, and they do not need combative people in the classroom.” 

I leaned back in my chair and let her soak that in, and waited for one of the common questions to come.

“So.. what? I am screwed because they messed up?” She gave a frustrated wave to the paperwork. “Because they could not see I was smart?”

“Some of them probably saw it. There is a stigma around telling a kid they are gifted. They assume that you’ll have the reaction your average kid would and think that means you don’t have to try anymore. A lot of people give up.” I offered up a helpless shrug at that with one arm up. “But you are not screwed. It just means you need to learn it now and not give up on it because it’s hard. I’ve been where you are in your lessons, so I will walk you through the steps on a few problems then let you loose to try a few on your own. I figure you will pick it up fast enough.”

“Does that mean more study sessions in your apartment?” Nessi chimed in sounding far too happy at that for my liking.

“There is a library in the building that I saw on the floor plan. It’s probably better to do it there.” That was something I needed to nip in the bud quickly.

I was already having problems with Nessi getting aggressive with things she wanted, prodded on by someone else or not. I really did not need to encourage it any more than was strictly necessary. In fact I needed to actively discourage her in that regard. People did stupid things when they were holding out hope for something that just was not going to happen.

Nessi seemed to deflate but the other girls were happy with it.

“Not gonna lie sir, I might miss the oversized furniture and the food. Cant watch T.V. or eat in the library.” Hernandez piped in. “I feel like I am in a fun house. This remote is the size of my bicep.” She laughed.

“Good, no distractions then.” I affirmed.

“Iiiiii think there are at least two here that are going to be distracted.” White added, She grinned directly at Mara who was taking a drink. “They’ve been staring.”

I groaned at that, Mara was now choking and turned away from the table towards the door. Nessi decided for some reason that she was small enough to hide behind a back pack and was now holding it over her face.

“None of that. They are kids, and should not be thinking about that.” I shot a look to White, “And teasing or not, you shouldn’t encourage it.”

“I’ll get offline with her and correct it when the shift changes.” Hernandez said not pulling her eyes away from the television.

“See that you do.” I said, not really bothered by the casual nature of Hernandez anymore. I was starting to get used to her I thought.

White just deflated at that. “Yes sir. Yes Sergeant.”

“Back on track, the library has a lot of resources that will help and it should keep you girls focused.” I tilted my head to the side. “And Mara should be an easier solution honestly. I am guessing you were always a little bit bookish? You got powers and now you are getting a lot of attention you are not used to, so you fell out of your study routine.”

She recovered from her coughing fit and was wiping her mouth with a napkin from the to go boxes as she blinked at me.

“How?” Was all she asked.

“I’ve got some experience, and super powers even when the changes they make to your body are drastic, always seem to shoot for some beauty ideal. You got powers which means power and likely at least financial stability when you get older. It also comes with decent looks. Now guys who are always looking for security in their partners are looking at you when they ignored you before because you were quiet, so you did not stand out.” I folded my arms.

Admittedly I was partially cheating. Yeah I could guess a lot of this on my own, but being able to know for sure just by looking at her helped.

“Yeah… I… You want me to go back to who I was don’t you?” She gripped the sides of her seat and looked at her lap.

“Not exactly. Just do not throw out the good with the bad. Whatever confidence boost you got is a good thing. Just keep in mind what I said. Men look for safety and security in their partner. If you cannot give them anything because you neglected growing after you got them, they may not stay with you when they find out.” The threat was veiled, but it registered in her expression that she understood it.

The time of arranged marriages was over, divorces were allowed for any reason. The only time men were not quick to leave someone now is if a child was involved. It was getting to the point it was starting to make the news.

She looked more sad than anything.

“I was just starting to get popular.” It sounded more like an argument than a statement.

“And you will stay popular. Just study like you used to, but give yourself break days. Schedule. If they cannot accept that you need to get things done some times and that the time they get your attention will come if they wait? It’s just going to turn into something toxic later.” I had some sympathy for her at least.

I had a similar issue when I was younger. Though it was more in my last life than this one. A young private just out of basic I had more confidence than high-school, I was buff, and I had pocket money.

Life later would have been a lot easier if I did not lose my head back then. However, I learned what parts of that life I could keep and what parts I had to give up. Mara was smart, she will figure it out too.

“Just… don’t pull out your schedule book in front of them or tell them you are going to pencil them in.” I said with a small laugh.

It was pretty easy to tell by the look on her face that is exactly what she was thinking of doing. I looked over to Hernandez. She would be a bad choice for this. White however would be better.

“There are people around you that are more than likely willing to give you advice on the dos and don'ts of dating. Just.. give it a year or two. Work on yourself, then look for someone else. Stay friends with the ones you are with now in case they turn out to be worth something later.” I gestured to White at the dos and don’ts which just made her shake her head at me wide eyed.

Hernandez looked more than a little amused at the whole situation.

The rest of the study session went pretty smoothly after that. As I promised Asher I went though problems with her step by step. After about three examples for each problem type she was able to get the rest on her own.

I did briefly have to tell Nessi that if her work was not done she could not just sit there and watch television with the soldiers.

Mara was pretty much able to handle herself once her phone was put away.

After around three hours the girls were tired and I decided to give them a reward for all of this.

“Looks like you all made some good progress. Let’s break for now.” I said as I got up to go to the kitchen.

“Guess that means we need to leave?” Nessi asked from the couch. Asher just groaned and stretched. White and Hernandez were on their phones. Mara was still reading something in her books.

“If that is the direction you want to take.” I said as I started to pull out ingredients. While it was something of a stereotype that men in this world were the cooks from the nuclear family days, I actually did enjoy it. “I heard there were grills just outside in the gardens around the quarters?”

I did not have my paycheck yet, but there were some food privileges if you were living on the base, and not all of them were just a mess hall. It seemed I had direct access to some of the food storage as long as I was not giving the food away. Evidently that is a rule that was put into place because Hippo was doing exactly that. There were some very well fed homeless shelters for a few months according to the sergeant in charge.

Everyone in the room perked up at that as I pulled out some meat and started packing it in a cooler. I think Hernandez was the only one who was fully aware of the Chorizo. The rest got rather excited at the steaks and burgers.

“Fuck. Yes!” White let out raising her arms up as she got out of the chair.

I smiled probably a little too brightly at her and said. “Hernandez can take you aside for whatever corrective measures she had in mind while things cook.” 

“Fuck.” She slumped. That got a laugh from everyone else.

I probably enjoyed that more than I should have.",1,1766209499.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

Madison Shaw had learned one hard truth early in life, her face was a magnet for trouble. 

From a young age, her striking looks made her a magnet for trouble, attracting a constant stream of 

unwanted attention. 

By the time she turned eighteen and was ready for college, the lifelong “good girl” had finally had enough. 

She made a radical decision. Hiring a professional makeup artist, she commissioned a custom 

“ugly” transformation, a meticulously crafted disguise that effectively concealed her striking beauty beneath layers of artificial plainness. 

Leaving her identity as the Shaw family heiress behind, she set off for Northwood University alone, 

determined to build a normal life. 

For two blissful years, the strategy worked perfectly. Shielded by her plain-Jane persona, Madison enjoyed the peaceful anonymity she’d always craved, free from the complications her looks usually brought. 

That all changed on a Christmas Eve during her sophomore year. While celebrating at a bar with her roommate, Madison watched in dismay as a group of guys began aggressively harassing her pretty friend, their hands wandering where they weren’t welcome. 

Madison’s temper flared. Stepping forward despite her pounding heart, she positioned herself between her friend and the harassers. 

“Hey! What do you think you’re doing?” she challenged, her voice cutting through the noise. “Can’t you hear my friend saying she doesn’t want to talk to you?” 

One of the men turned his contemptuous gaze on her, shoving her aside with a rough, dismissive hand. “Back off, ugly,” he sneered. “We weren’t hitting on you. Why are you butting in?” 

The force sent her stumbling backward, right into the solid, unexpected support of a stranger’s 

arms. 

As she regained her balance and looked up, her breath caught. The man holding her was ridiculously handsome, with features so perfectly sculpted they seemed almost unreal. He stood a head taller, all long limbs and lean strength, and as he glanced down at her, one eyebrow arched in curious amusement. 

“What’s going on here?” His voice was as captivating as his appearance, though it carried a lazy, almost bored drawl. 

He gave her a slow, appraising look. “Since when do they let minors into bars?”

Madison was dazed for a long moment before she managed to stammer, “I’m 21… I 

I just…” 

I just look young, she meant to say. 

But before she could finish, the man suddenly leaned in, closing the distance between them in an 

instant. 

Madison could even see the reflection of the fake freckles on her face in his pupils. 

“You look familiar,” he muttered to himself. “Do you go to Northwood University?” 

Madison nodded instinctively. She saw the corner of his mouth quirk up. 

“So you’re my junior then.” He straightened up and looked at the troublemakers, his smile casual and unconcerned. “You’ve got some nerve, picking on my junior.” 

The previously arrogant guys instantly paled. “Mr. Quinn… we didn’t know she was with you…”, then they turned and fled in a panic. 

Madison only pieced it together later, the man who’d stepped in was none other than Ethan Quinn, the trust-fund baby whose reputation for trouble was the stuff of walking legend all over Northwood’s coffee shops and fraternity houses. 

He was recklessness personified, a slave to his own whims with a reputation for chaos that trailed 

him like a shadow. 

People said if he woke up and decided he wanted the moon, he wouldn’t just try to buy it, he’d probably figure out how to pull it down from the sky himself, just to prove a point. 

But two years ago, for reasons no one understood, he’d suddenly donated a building to Northwood University and even enrolled as a graduate student. 

He rarely attended classes, just occasionally roared past campus in various luxury sports cars. Yet, despite all that, his face alone was enough to attract countless female admirers at school. 

Rumor had it the girls who had a crush on him could form a line that circled the library ten times over. There were even stories of girls attempting suicide over him. 

The moment the New Year’s countdown bells rang, Madison suddenly realized, She was about to become one of them. For the first time in her life, Madison had a crush on someone. 

From that day on, she’d bring him breakfast and even custom-ordered a spirit shirt from the campus print shop with his last name and jersey number, leaving it anonymously in his locker. 

During one of his basketball games, she sneakily put a carton of milk in his bag, only to be caught

red-handed by him and his friends. 

His friends burst into laughter. One, feeling slightly sympathetic, reminded her, “Hey, Freckles, our man Ethan doesn’t drink matcha…” 

But before the words fully left his mouth, they watched in shock as Ethan picked up the matcha milk Madison had given him and drank every last drop. 

Then he leaned close to Madison’s ear, his voice low. “I prefer strawberry flavour.” 

He caught the faint scent of strawberry body wash from her skin and chuckled softly. “Something that smells like you.” 

Madison’s heart slammed against her ribs. Looking into the man’s teasing, half-smiling eyes, she 

knew she was a goner. 

On Valentine’s Day, Madison finally mustered the courage to confess her feelings to Ethan. 

She had assumed a boring girl like her would definitely be rejected. Ethan might seem carefree and irreverent, but in two years, he had never agreed to date any woman. 

To her surprise, Ethan spoke slowly and deliberately, “Madison, being with me means you’ll 

become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you… willing to accept that?” 

Madison was stunned for a second, then her heart exploded with joy, mirroring the fireworks 

blooming overhead. “I… I am willing!” 

Madison originally thought Ethan’s question was just a casual remark. But she never expected that 

after they started dating, her assignments would be torn up, her locker spray-painted, and girls 

who liked Ethan would trip her in the cafeteria. 

Having grown up sheltered and protected by the Shaw family, Madison was obedient and naive, completely unprepared for this kind of treatment. 

Now, she faced daily harassment. The worst incident was when she was kidnapped by Ethan’s 

enemies and locked in a warehouse for a full day and night. 

After she was safe, Ethan pressed a kiss to her forehead, his voice a low murmur. “I’m sorry you 

went through that, Maddie.” 

And just like that, every moment of fear and uncertainty stilled. In that single sentence, she found a 

gentle anchor, and the world felt right again. 

Until, just before graduation, the most sought-after girl in the Advertising Department was thrown 

into the campus lake.

Madison followed the crowd to the lake’s edge, only to see Ethan, acting like a madman, brutally beating a man on the ground. 

His eyes were bloodshot, the usual playful arrogance on his face replaced by pure fury. “I told you! Stay away from Chloe Grant! Are you deaf?!” 

Chloe Grant, the most sought-after girl of their department. 

Ethan only stopped punching when the man’s face was a bloody mess. Then he scooped Chloe up into his arms and carried her away. As the man passed by Madison, she managed a weak, “Ethan…” 

But he didn’t even glance her way. 

The crowd of onlookers soon dispersed, but Madison stood there, frozen in place. She walked over to the beaten, bruised man and asked softly, “Why…?” 

The man forced his eyes open, recognized Madison, and let out a low laugh. “You’re the new girlfriend Ethan’s seeing? You want to know why I went after Chloe Grant?” 

He sneered, intense hatred flashing in his eyes. “Because my sister killed herself over Ethan Quinn! So I’m going to torment the woman he loves for revenge!” 

“And the woman Ethan Quinn loves is Chloe Grant! Why else do you think a spoiled rich brat like him would come study at Northwood? He followed her here because he fell for her at first sight!” 

“But too many girls like him, and he’s pissed off too many people. Everyone targeted Chloe for revenge. She was harassed so badly she had to take a year off, developed depression, and that’s why they broke up.” 

“As for you…” The guy gave Madison a scornful look. 

“A plain Jane like you… you don’t actually think Ethan likes you, do you? Let’s be real. You’re just a decoy he found to draw fire away from his real girlfriend.” 

Madison’s face instantly lost all color. She remembered the day she confessed, when Ethan had asked her, “Being with me means you’ll become a target. People might bully you because of me. Are you willing to accept that?” 

So… so that was what he meant. He was never worried about her getting hurt. He wanted her to be a 

human shield for the girl he truly loved. 

Madison had no idea how she made it back to her dorm. She threw away her umbrella and walked through the pouring rain, her waterproof makeup streaking and washing away. 

When she finally reached her dorm entrance, just as she was about to go inside, “Madison?” 

Chapter 1

A familiar male voice rang out. She turned and saw Ethan standing under her dorm window, apparently waiting for her. Before Madison could say anything, Ethan spoke first, looking stunned. 

“Madison, your face…”

1pr6u21,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicWorkplace/comments/1pr6u21/fellow_mortals_wildlife_hospital_internship_beware/,"Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital Internship, Beware!","This post is the warning that I wish I had before I worked at Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. I feel it is extremely important to get the word out about this place before they hire their next round of summer interns! I've put a lot of thought into writing this, because the hospital DOES do a lot of good in rehabilitating tons of wildlife, and saving many little lives. However, I care about people having good lives, too. I feel it is my moral duty to warn the public about Fellow Mortals.

1. The hospital is understaffed and misleading from its website. FM has 4 staff members, not however many people that you see on their website. There are NO veterinarians that work there. No one that works there has obtained a DVM, which is shady for an institution that calls itself a hospital. 
2. The work hours are abysmal. The hours are 8:00 AM to 10PM, so around 14 hour shifts every day. Interns get one 30 minute lunch break, and one 15 minute dinner break. The rest of the time, you are on your feet and moving constantly. If you are caught sitting down for a water break, you will be talked to about the quality of your work. I’m not sure if this breaks labor laws for the state of WI, but this is truly grueling. You also may not have your phone on your person at all except for when on breaks, so don’t even think about taking any photos with any animals. 
3. You never get to enjoy your days off. You get two non-consecutive days off per week (ex. Wednesday and Saturday), so it is impossible to travel anywhere. On your days off, you are expected to wash a minimum 5 loads of ""animal laundry"". That means that before you can hope to go anywhere on your day off, you need to wash, dry and fold poop-encrusted rugs for hours. You never truly get a day to yourself.
4. Don't even think about feeling under the weather. There are NO sick days at this place, and if you fall ill, the owner of the hospital will ostracize you and make you test out your health insurance to fix the problem immediately so that you may return to work. The owner will make inappropriate comments about your health to other employees, while asking you invasive questions about your health history.
5. You will clean blood, poop, and all the fluids without an inch of proper PPE. Expect poop particles in your face, constantly. 
6. Concerns from interns about health issues happening with patients are NOT taken seriously. Animals get more sick because little things are overlooked when interns bring them up to staff members. 
7. The owner is has problems within her personal life, and she takes them out on her employees. Her staff members walk on eggshells around her. She will corner interns and go on political rants which are absolutely inappropriate for the workplace. She singles out interns that she does not like and treats them terribly, while praising the ones that she does like. I’ve never experienced such high-school-ish behavior from an employer before. She takes a passive-aggressive approach to issues and instructs staff members to correct intern mistakes, rather than speaking to said intern herself. When she feels that she’s acted especially out of line, she will leave and reappear with coffee and doughnuts to try to smooth things over. This dynamic is much like that of an abusive parent. I am avoiding giving direct quotes here because the owner has an avid social media presence, and will most likely find this post. She singularly made my experience miserable.

I am ashamed to say this, but the MOST concerning thing I’ve experienced is the hospital’s attitude toward suffering. On paper FM is all about saving lives (even invasive species), but they will do so at any cost. For example, if an animal is severely injured, in pain, and disfigured, staff will not euthanize it. Instead, they will wait for the individual to develop a life-threatening complication such as an infection before putting the creature out of its misery. The hospital is filled with disabled and suffering animals who have NO hope of being released, and instead spend their poor “lives” in cages. It is truly horrible to see creatures suffering every day with no hope of getting better, and to the contrary, to have staff actively waiting for the creature to suffer even MORE severely so that they may euthanize it. 

This hospital is not a good place for an intern to learn about wildlife rehabilitation. and I strongly recommend you look into working at other wildlife hospitals. I hope this post encourages you to find alternate types of employment other than FM! It’s hard to find intern testimonials about this place online for a reason, I suspect. I am happy to answer any questions anyone may have. ",1,1766209301.0,ToxicWorkplace,0,1.0,False

1pr6r1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildlifeRehab/comments/1pr6r1y/fellow_mortals_wildlife_hospital_internship/,Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital Internship,"This post is the warning that I wish I had before I worked at Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. I feel it is extremely important to get the word out about this place before they hire their next round of summer interns! I've put a lot of thought into writing this, because the hospital DOES do a lot of good in rehabilitating tons of wildlife, and saving many little lives. However, I care about people having good lives, too. I feel it is my moral duty to warn the public about Fellow Mortals.

1. The hospital is understaffed and misleading from its website. FM has 4 staff members, not however many people that you see on their website. There are NO veterinarians that work there. No one that works there has obtained a DVM, which is shady for an institution that calls itself a hospital. 
2. The work hours are abysmal. The hours are 8:00 AM to 10PM, so around 14 hour shifts every day. Interns get one 30 minute lunch break, and one 15 minute dinner break. The rest of the time, you are on your feet and moving constantly. If you are caught sitting down for a water break, you will be talked to about the quality of your work. I’m not sure if this breaks labor laws for the state of WI, but this is truly grueling. You also may not have your phone on your person at all except for when on breaks, so don’t even think about taking any photos.
3. You never get to enjoy your days off. You get two non-consecutive days off per week (ex. Wednesday and Saturday), so it is impossible to travel anywhere. On your days off, you are expected to wash a minimum 5 loads of ""animal laundry"". That means that before you can hope to go anywhere on your day off, you need to wash, dry and fold poop-encrusted rugs for hours. You never truly get a day to yourself.
4. Don't even think about feeling under the weather. There are NO sick days at this place, and if you fall ill, the owner of the hospital will ostracize you and make you test out your health insurance at urgent care for a cold, so that you may return to work. The owner will make inappropriate comments about your health to other employees, while asking you invasive questions about your health history.
5. You will clean blood, poop, and all the fluids without an inch of proper PPE. Expect poop particles in your face, constantly. 
6. Concerns from interns about health issues happening with patients are NOT taken seriously. Animals get more sick because little things are overlooked when interns bring them up to staff members. 
7. The owner is has problems within her personal life, and she takes them out on her employees. Her staff members walk on eggshells around her. She will corner interns and go on political rants which are absolutely inappropriate for the workplace. She singles out interns that she does not like and treats them terribly, while praising the ones that she does like. I’ve never experienced such high-school-ish behavior from an employer before. She takes a passive-aggressive approach to issues and instructs staff members to correct intern mistakes, rather than speaking to said intern herself. When she feels that she’s acted especially out of line, she will leave and reappear with coffee and doughnuts to try to smooth things over. This dynamic is much like that of an abusive parent. I am avoiding giving direct quotes here because the owner has an avid social media presence, and will most likely find this post. She singularly made my experience miserable.

I am ashamed to say this, but the MOST concerning thing I’ve experienced is the hospital’s attitude toward suffering. On paper FM is all about saving lives (even invasive species), but they will do so at any cost. For example, if an animal is severely injured, in pain, and disfigured, staff will not euthanize it. Instead, they will wait for the individual to develop a life-threatening complication such as an infection before putting the creature out of its misery. The hospital is filled with disabled and suffering animals who have NO hope of being released, and instead spend their poor “lives” in cages. It is truly horrible to see creatures suffering every day with no hope of getting better, and to the contrary, to have staff actively waiting for the creature to suffer even MORE severely so that they may euthanize it.

This hospital is not a good place for an intern to learn about wildlife rehabilitation. and I strongly recommend you look into working at other wildlife hospitals. I hope this post encourages you to find alternate types of employment other than FM! It’s hard to find intern testimonials about this place online for a reason, I suspect. I am happy to answer any questions anyone may have. ",3,1766209020.0,WildlifeRehab,1,1.0,False

flair for drama. 

In the year she was partying hardest overseas, her father yanked her back home with an overnight express letter marked URGENT. It held only one cold line: \[Come home at once. Marry Ethan Foster.\] 

Ethan Foster was the youngest rising star on the base–cool, restrained, almost ascetic, rigidly 

self–disciplined, the complete opposite of her in every way. 

She thrived on noise and crowds; he preferred quiet and order. 

She did whatever she liked and had a long history of reckless stunts, while he followed every rule to the 

letter, treating discipline like something carved in stone. 

She was bright and free–spirited, changing boyfriends the way other people changed clothes, and he was infamous for avoiding women altogether, never even brushing the hand of a female soldier under his 

command. 

Just thinking about marrying a man so straight–laced made her feel like she couldn’t breathe. 

So, determined to blow up the wedding, Scarlett threw everything she had at the problem. 

She partied and danced for three straight nights at a downtown club, hoping he’d finally back off, but he 

showed up in full dress uniform, and under all the curious stares, he calmly slung her onto his back and 

carried her home. 

She deliberately crashed into the base commander’s front–yard fence, wanting him to see how outrageous 

she could be, but he went over in person to apologize, paid for the repairs, and buried the whole thing before 

it could spread. 

She charged forward raising hell without a care, and he was always right behind her, quietly cleaning up 

whatever mess she left in her wake. 

This time, she’d gotten into another fight and was being held at the station. He had just finished a three–day emergency mission when he rushed over to bail her out, still in uniform, his eyes bloodshot with exhaustion. 

Looking at his tired but ramrod–straight back, Scarlett felt a rare urge to explain herself. 

She wanted to say that this time she wasn’t the one causing trouble, that the other guy had made a move on 

her first because he thought she was pretty, but before she could get the words out, Ethan was already in 

front of her, gently taking her hand. 

There was a tiny cut on the tip of her finger, something she hadn’t even noticed, and he pulled a small

first–aid kit from his uniform pocket, lowered his head, disinfected the wound, and pressed a bandage over it. 

“Does it hurt?” he asked. 

In that moment, every excuse and argument Scarlett had prepared jammed in her throat. 

He lifted his gaze, his eyes steady. “I don’t care how much trouble you cause or how big a mess you make. I 

can handle all of that. The only thing I care about is whether this–right here–hurts.” 

Does this hurt… 

Scarlett’s heart lurched, as if something had slammed into the softest part of her chest, shatter 

one of her defenses in an instant. 

✓ last 

All her life, whenever she got into trouble, her father only shouted about how embarrassing she was, and her stepmother only put on a fake show of telling her to act like a lady, but not once had anyone ever asked her 

if she was hurt, or if she felt wronged. 

With her voice gone hoarse, she heard herself say, “Ethan, we can get married.” 

Something like a flicker of light passed through his dark eyes. 

“But before that, I need to ask you something,” she pressed, her pride and possessiveness sharpening her tone. “Do you have anyone you’ve ever loved and couldn’t have? My man has to belong to me completely. He doesn’t get to have anyone else in his heart–past, present, or future. It can only be me.” 

Ethan’s gaze locked onto hers, heavy and unwavering. “No. Only you.” 

So Scarlett married him. 

Southport’s wildest red rose married the coldest, most untouchable officer in the entire military. 

After the wedding, one line started making the rounds in Southport’s upper circles. 

Of all the people you could mess with, don’t you dare mess with General Foster’s wife, Scarlett Jones. 

Because no matter how big a mess she made, that stone–faced grim reaper of a general would still be right behind her, always having her back and keeping the world from crashing down on her. 

Scarlett honestly believed that she’d melted that block of ice with her fire. 

Right up until the day she went out to the base to drop off some files Ethan had forgotten at home. 

As she reached the training grounds, she saw a cluster of officers gathered together in what looked like some sort of mixer, where the mood was loud and lively. 

Chanter 1

Ethan was surrounded by a few fellow officers, and it looked like he’d just lost a game and was being pushed into answering one of those truth–or–dare questions. 

Someone called out, loud and clear, “General Foster, come on–what’s the biggest lie you’ve ever told in your 

life?” 

The noise around them dipped, the group settling down as everyone turned to watch the commanding officer who was known for being rigidly honest. 

Ethan was silent for a moment, his profile shadowed and hard under the lights, and then he picked up the coffee mug in front of him, took a sip, and finally spoke, his voice low but clear enough to carry right to 

where Scarlett had just stepped into the doorway. 

“Someone once asked me if I had someone I loved and couldn’t have.” 

“I lied and told her no.” 

It was like a thunderclap going off inside her head. 

Scarlett froze where she stood, every drop of blood in her body turning to ice. 

He’d lied? 

He had someone he loved and couldn’t have? 

Then why had he told her he didn’t? 

Why had he married her at all? 

A chill shot up from the soles of her feet and raced through her entire body, leaving her feeling like she’d been dropped into a block of ice, her limbs shaking from the cold. 

She was just about to storm over and demand an answer when one of his aides hurried to Ethan’s side and murmured something in his ear. 

Ethan’s usually composed face changed in an instant. 

He shot to his feet so fast he didn’t even pause to explain to anyone, snatched his uniform jacket from the back of his chair, and headed for the door, moving so quickly he left a gust of air in his wake. 

He didn’t even notice her standing right there in the doorway. 

As he barreled past, his shoulder slammed hard into hers, and he didn’t react at all, like every sense he had was locked onto a single target up ahead. 

Scarlett staggered from the hit, pain flaring in her shoulder, but the ache in her chest was even worse. 

Chantor 1

She swallowed the pain and the roiling questions in her gut and found herself following after him on instinct. 

She watched Ethan jump into a Jeep, the engine roaring to life before it shot out of the lot like an arrow. 

Scarlett immediately flagged down a car and ordered the driver to stay right on his tail. 

The vehicles finally stopped outside an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. 

Ethan rushed inside with his aide on his heels, and Scarlett slipped in after them, keeping to the shadows. 

Inside the warehouse, a wild–eyed kidnapper was holding a knife to a young woman’s throat. 

The girl was wearing a simple, elegant dress and was sobbing so hard she looked heartbreakin like she might faint at any second. 

fragile, 

The moment Ethan saw her, his face darkened, and his voice held a barely noticeable tremor. Let her go.” 

The kidnapper let out an ugly laugh. “Knew I picked the right target! Ethan, everyone out there says you spoil that out–of–control wife of yours, Scarlett, but I’m the only one who knows the person you really keep at the center of your world is her–Nora West.” 

Nora West? Scarlett’s heart dropped like a stone. 

The kidnapper kept shouting, “On that last border mission, because of you, my guys ended up dead or maimed! Today, I’m going to make you feel what it’s like to lose the person you love most!” 

The veins on the back of Ethan’s hand stood out, but his voice stayed as steady as he could make it. “I’m the one you want. Let her go and take it out on me.” 

“Let her go? Sure.” The kidnapper kicked a knife across the floor, the blade flashing coldly as it skidded to a stop at Ethan’s feet. “Stab yourself in the chest. Then I’ll think about letting her walk.” 

“No! Ethan, don’t!” Nora wailed, shaking her head as tears streamed down her face. 

Ethan held her gaze for a long, deep second, and the look in his eyes was so full of feeling that Scarlett realized she had never once seen him look at her that way. 

Then he bent, scooped up the knife, and drove it into his own chest without a moment’s hesitation. 

In the shadows, Scarlett dug her nails so hard into her palms that she nearly broke the skin, and it was the only thing that kept her from screaming. 

He could actually try to kill himself–without hesitation–for another woman. ",1,1766208921.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1pr6ohi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pr6ohi,9 Days of Davidoff Day 5: Millennium Piramides,"I have places to be this evening, so while venturing into the medium-full territory with the Millennium Piramides - also the second biggest cigar of the sampler after the WC Churchill - is respecting the planned progression, it may also prove to be a brave move. No matter. I have refreshments - nuts and sparkly water - to tide me over.

The cold draw is heavy wood and cocoa; which are accentuated at the first puff. It’s hard to get the light going well at first - it’s hard to see the blue flame in daylight - but I persevere and we seem to get going.

The wood and cocoa flavours prevail in the first third. Maybe a hint of coffee but it’s fleeting. Approaching the end, some cracked fine black pepper makes an appearance, but like a fine grained presence, not a peppercorn burst.

The flavours become more muted in the second third, but are still present and enjoyable. There’s also another sensation that emerges that I can’t quite pin down. The best I can pin down is it’s a kind of meatiness that puts me in mind of a decent steak, or a portobello mushroom. Towards the tail end, the cocoa notes make a resurgence, but more like a dark chocolate this time rather than the raw cocoa of earlier.

I start slowing down at the final third to try and minimise any potential bitter notes I’ve noted in past reviews. This leads to more of that meatiness in a form I want expecting: beef sausage. I’m not kidding. Smoking this entering the final third, if I were eating a slightly overdone Bunnings snag, with a little sauce and maybe a touch of onion, I’d be getting the same satisfaction. 

That flavour too passes and I return to the flavours before. This isn’t a cigar with pronounced differences throughout. Which is fine, not all cigars need to be intellectualised. 

With around 1.5 inches to go, I start struggling with the draw, and the bitterness is starting to arrive. But I’ve been in for around 1hr45min at this point, so I feel comfortable calling it a day.

Aside from the issues at the end, the draw was good throughout. Smoke production was outstanding, but this is the first Davidoff where I’ve struggled to maintain a consistent burn line throughout, with odd runs requiring a touch up periodically. Given the issues I had lighting it to start, I’m prepared to put that down to operator error. 

I’m going to go out on a limb and say I enjoyed this more than the WC. Despite arguably being fuller than the WC, I found it more approachable. It hits many of the same notes, but with less of a punch. If someone were to ask me for something in the Davidoff range punchier than the Signature or Aniversario but not too overwhelming, I’d probably point them to this.

Does it take the top spot over the Aniversario Entreacto? I’d say it’s a fraction behind. The flavour profiles are very different; the AE gave me none of the earthy cocoa notes I got from the MP, and the MP gave me nothing like the light honey of the AE, and is also nearly double the length. I think I’d personally reach for the AE more often, but that’s a matter of preference, not quality. If I got the chance to compare the Aniversario series against the Millennium series back-to-back in more similar vitolas, that would be the real test.

As it is, I’d rate this similarly to the AE: I have a time and a place for this stick, but at RRP, it’s venturing into Opus X and discount Cohiba territory. Hard call.",4,1766208780.0,Cigars_Australia,2,1.0,False

I was born and raised in Australia, I only speak English, and my upbringing was predominantly Catholic/Christian in terms of religion.

My knowledge of golems comes from various other fantasy works and games etc.

I do know that historically they are from Judaism, I haven't yet done enough research into that, I will, but at the moment it's not hugely required.

My issue at the moment is that I have a character who is going to be centuries older, a Dracula type individual, and like many other authors use latin or proto-germanic words and the like, I want this character to sometimes drop in some hebrew. As in, maybe he doesn't know the common name for coffee, so he asks for a drink of that, but uses the hebrew word.

My problem with this issue, I don't know a damn thing about hebrew. And what I need are how some words might sound when phonetically spelled out in english.

This becomes tricky to find easily online, i can use google translate to get the word in hebrew, but those don't come with phonetics. And it's a different alphabet.

So, is there some tool online I can use to help? Or should I just start trying to learn the language? (i casually ask as though it's gonna be easy...)",1,1766208551.0,hebrew,4,1.0,False

1pr6l0b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pr6l0b,Compilation of vending machines I found in Jakarta,"Vending machines are very rare in Jakarta. They can usually be found in public places such as MRT/KRL stations, airport, or parks. Back then, they were even rarer because they can only accept banknote in mint condition (no crumples and folds) and they can't dispense changes. Exact change only. That means if the drink is 7K but you insert 10K banknote, then say wassalam to the 3k change. Not to mention security and profitability issues. But now, thanks to QRIS, people can buy from vending machine much easier, just scan the QR using e-wallet/mobile banking apps. That's why they are starting popping up in many places with more variety of goods, not just drinks and snacks.

Here are some of the vending machines I found in Jakarta and description of each machine. Note that all of these vending machines only accept QRIS, no cash accepted.

1. Perfume by spray vending machine (Bendungan Hilir MRT Station)

Instead of buying perfume by bottle, you can buy perfume by the number of sprays here. Price starts from 2.5K IDR per spray. Although for me this looks like an attempt to sell free perfume sample.

2. Book vending machine (Bridge between Sudirman CL station and Dukuh Atas LRT station)

Well, it sells book from a certain publisher, mostly novels

3. and 4. Pocari sweat vending machine (Park near Sudirman station)

Well now this is very rare, an outdoor vending machine! There are concerns that putting vending machine outdoor in Jakarta like this can expose the machine to weather, theft, and vandalism. But somehow Otsuka Pharma seems so confident to put their machines outdoor like this. In fact, there are two in this park alone. I found other Pocari vending machines in places such as Mataram park (near Al Azhar Mosque), Pasar Festival outdoor parking lot, and near a river bank (pic no. 4)

5. Photo booth (Park near Sudirman station)

Close to previous vending machine is an open photo booth. This is even riskier to put one outdoor because it uses an expensive DSLR camera. Usually they can only be found indoors in areas like museum. I wonder how it is still functioning and survive the theft and vandalism.

6. Drink Vending Machine with LCD interface (Bundaran HI MRT station)

This is one of the most common type vending machine here. Usually the company themselves who puts the machine, and they only sell products from that company. In this case, this is a Mayora vending machine, so it mainly sells Mayora products such as Le Minerale, Teh Pucuk Harum, Kopiko, and sometimes snack like Beng Beng. This is the machine that those American travellers thought looks futuristic because it uses touchable LCD screen as its interface.

7. Fujifilm Vending Machine (Bundaran HI MRT station)

This machine caters to analog photographers. They sell analog film roll, instax sheets, disposable cameras, and even instax camera worth 1.5M IDR (most expensive thing I found so far sold by vending machine)

8. Haagen-Dasz Vending Machine (Bundaran HI MRT station)

Self explanatory. I also found one in Istora Mandiri MRT Station

9. Bali Surfer Perfume Vending Machine (Bundaran HI MRT station)

Again, self explanatory. They sell perfumes by bottles

10. Alif Prayer Kit Vending Machine (Bundaran HI MRT station)

Another uncommon vending machine. They sell portable prayer kit for Muslim such as mini sajadah and mukena. Very convenient if you forgot to bring one from home.

11. BOS Perfume Vending Machine (Bundaran HI MRT station)

Another perfume vending machine, but this one also sell other stuff like hats and umbrellas

12. Jumpstart Snack and Drink Vending Machine (Sudirman CL station)

This one uses American style vending machine. One thing that I think is quite unique from this vending machine is that they sell drink and snacks in bundle. So you can buy snacks like Beng-Beng bundled up with drinks like Aqua or Teh Botol in one pack

13. Plasticpay Reverse Vending Machine (Sudirman CL station)

Instead of buying stuff from vending machine, this machine pays you! Just put empty plastic bottle there and the machine will reward you with points, which later can be exchanged with cash and transfered into your e-wallet. You need to download their app though for registration.

14. Pokemon TCG Vending Machine (Sudirman CL station)

They sell physical official Pokemon TCG here. Very rare, I heard the other places they can be found is in some malls. So it is unusual to see one in station like this.

15. 2-in-1 Jumpstart vending machine (Bendungan Hilir MRT Station)

This is similar with vending on no. 12, but this one also sells hot coffee.

16. Squeezeme Fresh Orange Juice Vending Machine (Cikoko LRT station)

This machine sells orange juice freshly squeezed from the orange. They even show you the process through its transparent window. But with 35K price tag for measly less than 100ml of juice, I don't think it is worth it. What's strange that they can be found easily in stations and airports, but I never see anyone buying juice from this machine.

I also found other machine such as cotton candy vending machine (but this one in Bogor), and a smoothie vending machine where they sell frozen fruit inside a cup, and then you can put that cup inside an automatic blender in the vending machine. IIRC it was either in Senayan Mastercard MRT station or Istora Mandiri MRT station, I forgot which one.

I live in a conservative area, so while I now have a queer friend group I feel safe around, I still have some past friends/acquaintances who are very much the opposite. Think white, christian, conservative, not very open minded.

I met up with one for coffee, hoping to catch up. I used to be close with her, and I remember her being a nice person, so why not? Within a few minutes of talking, she made a homophobic joke and said “I really thought you were gay when we first met.”

1pr6j5n,https://i.redd.it/ufb30bt1oa8g1.jpeg,“Stay Away from Sneaky Snow Bunnies” book,"I share an amazon account with my mom and she added this book to MY wishlist. It’s a children’s book about two little boys, pointing out the dangers of trusting “snow bunnies” (a term often used for white women). The overall theme of the book is that “white snow bunnies” are sneaky and not to be trusted.

A little bit of background, I’ve been with my wife who’s white for about 7 years and we’ve just had our first child a little over a week ago. We’ve been asking friends and family to gift us books instead of clothes or toys for babygirl because we are incredibly blessed and are set on all of that stuff through toddlerhood but are both avid book lovers and want our daughter to be as well!

Growing up my mother always made it very clear that she’d prefer my siblings and I to date/marry within our own race. She’s always been accepting of white partners I’ve brought home but will refer to them as “one of the good ones”. Due to what she sees and hears in media, she has a serious distrust in white people. I get it but I also understand that not all white people are the same.

A little bit more background, I have an 11 year old brother that she’s a bit firmer with on the fact that she does not want him with a white woman when he grows up. So she may have potentially added it to my wishlist instead of her own so it may be a book for him—which I’m still not thrilled about since his sister-in-law is white and he loves her! He doesn’t remember a life before her. I don’t want him to begin to distrust her because of my moms beliefs but ultimately he’s not my kid, I have no say in what he’s taught.

My question is, if my mom gifts this book to my child, how do I handle this? What do I say? My home is no place for hate and I am fuming just seeing this book in my wishlist. I fear she’ll brush it off as joke when confronted. Anyone else have similar experiences with their family disliking the race of their partners?",3,1766208292.0,interracialdating,6,0.67,False

*Knock knock knock knock knock…*

*3am…*

*Knock knock knock knock knock…*

*4am…*

*Knock knock knock knock knock…*

*5am…*

*6am…*

*7am…*

*… silence.* Finally. Silence. I had not slept a wink. All hours of the night I lay there, on the cold steel bathroom floor, listening to something knocking on the door. Occasionally, I would hear it speak. Kind of. What passed for its voice floated through the gap beneath the door. Mostly it was just gurgles and whispers, but every so often I would make out words.

*“Too late…”* it would say, in between strange slurping sounds.

*“Don’t let me go,”* I could make out, on the tail end of a growl, similar to that of a rabid dog.

During the night, amid that infernal knocking, I heard the ferry making more stops. I would note different sounds and sensations as the ferry traversed into what felt and sounded like the strangest of places. Some sounded quite similar to the rickety wooden pier we had docked at earlier in the night, but others were different. At times I would hear what sounded like giant, medieval style draw bridges come crashing down. 

Other times, the distant clang of an anchor hitting the bottom of the river would echo throughout the ship, followed by scratching noises as though things were clawing their way up the sides of the ferry. Moments later, I heard the sounds of wet footfalls making their way inside the cabin. 

At around 4am in the morning, I felt an immense crash, as though we had hit something immovable. I swear I vividly heard the sounds of creaking trees and the ferry itself shaking and vibrating, as though it had sailed straight into the treeline beyond the riverbanks. Of course, this all sounds impossible, and I had no visual way to confirm any of this, I could only piece together what I was hearing and feeling. 

As I’m sure you can appreciate, even when morning broke and I could hear that knocking no longer, I was quite apprehensive to the thought of exiting my safe haven. I may have hidden out there the rest of the day, had it not been for the growls emanating from my own stomach. 

It dawned on me then that I had not eaten in over 30 hours. It’s not that I hadn’t noticed, it’s just that I had quite literally been in a constant state of fight or flight mode pretty much since I boarded. I wouldn’t say the fear had worn off by this point. It sure as hell hadn’t. But my body was making it very clear it would be ignored no longer. I had to eat.

***Dooooonnng… Dooooonnng…***

The sound of buoys outside was music to my ears. Not only did it mean we were back in the harbour, away from that awful river, but I also took solace in those subtle reminders of normality. The idea that the world outside this vessel resembled something of what I once knew it to be. I had to hold on to something. Anything that might allow the concept of hope to remain strong in my heart. I then heard another familiar sound. The crackle of that damned P.A. system. Exhausted, I braced myself, wondering what horrors the mysterious voice was to command unto me today.

*“May I have your attention passengers! The café service is now open. Please form an orderly line, and you will be served momentarily.”*

Thank God, I thought, I could get some food into my stomach. I slowly inched open the bathroom door, the thought of that awful man who had chased me in there last night ever present in my mind. Thankfully, he was nowhere to be seen as I swung the door open all the way and stepped back out, making my way up and around the corner to the stairwell, and there I paused. I still couldn’t see that particular man anywhere, but there were many others now. 

Some of them, I recognised as my fellow passengers from yesterday, as well as some folks similar to them. Others within the masses, however, were very different. They were all shuffling their way up the stairs to the cafeteria, maybe twenty people now altogether. They all wore those same empty faced stares. It was as though this was some kind of ritual that needed to happen, rather than something they wanted to be doing. 

I gave a little nod as the three men I recognised from yesterday limped by me on their way upstairs, but they didn’t even look at me. They just stared straight ahead, their jaws slack. They were followed by two strange looking… “people”… I say people, but I really was not sure. They looked human enough at first glance, but looking closer, I began to notice strange imperfections in their forms. It was almost as if they were the result of an AI generator’s *attempt* at a human being, plucked off the screen and dumped into the real world. Their legs looked as though they shouldn’t be sufficient to support their forms, nor did they move correctly. They didn’t really “walk” in the sense that we know it. They more so stuttered. That’s the best I can explain it. Their hands were very strange too, with long fingers that seemed to curve into pointed ends.

I turned my eyes away from these things, refusing to focus on them any longer. I had more pressing matters, I thought, as my stomach gurgled once again. I went to the back of the line and started making my way up the stairs. 

As I stood there, waiting my turn as my travelling companions all collected their orders before shuffling off back down the stairs, I caught sight of my buddy, Café Guy. He smiled that same warm smile, going about his routine of preparing coffees and heating up frozen pastries and the like. Before long, it was my turn. His expression once again changed when he saw me, morphing into more of a sarcastic smile, shaking his head a little.

*“So… how did the night go?”* He asked me, a suggestion in his tone that he knew full well it had not been a good night. I paused a moment, letting out a little sigh and shooting back a defeated look in his direction.

*“I think you know, mate…”* I said, exhausted from my sleepless night hiding out away from that swamp demon or whatever the hell it was, and mildly annoyed that he seemed to find it so amusing.

When he turned back around to face me, however, I noted a hint of understanding in his eyes. As was the theme with him, I could not discern whether this was legitimate or not. There was no malice in his expressions, nor in his words, but I could not yet conclude whether his demeanour was the result of a genuinely nonchalant attitude, some form of apprehensive kindness, or just downright indifference toward me.

As if he knew what I was thinking and wanted to further throw me off course, his expression once again morphed back into a warm, welcoming smile. It didn’t make me feel any better though. If anything, it made me feel even more helpless. Even more trapped. Like no matter what I asked him I was never going to be granted the answers I was seeking.

*“I’m not getting off this ferry… am I?”* I asked bluntly. Café Guy laughed softly as he grabbed a cloth and started wiping down the bench. He did not laugh as if to mock me. It was more of a comforting chuckle, like that of a kind, old Grandfather. 

*“It’s important to know one’s place in this world, I always say. Some questions are above both our pay grades.”* He answered nonchalantly, but I wasn’t letting him off that easily. And I was beginning to get a little frustrated with being brushed off the way I was.

*“Mate, you clearly work here. Wherever here is… You obviously know what’s going on, what’s with the bullshit? If this is all pointless you may as well tell me what’s happening!”* I snapped back, my patience running thin. This did not phase him at all though. His smile never once wavering, he stopped what he was doing, turning around to face me and leaning over the bench before responding.

*“You say that as though every question* ***has*** *an answer. You ask as if we are entitled to these answers, even were they to exist. Tell me, where were you headed when you boarded this vessel? Hmm? Do you know? Do any of us know where we’re going at any one time, or in the grand scheme of things? I should hope not. There would be no mystery to life if that were the case. Then where would be the excitement? Why do we go to bed with hope in our hearts if not for the fact that* ***we don’t know*** *what’s going to happen tomorrow? Or the next day? I would suggest you keep this in mind young man…”*

He did not speak these words with any hint of malice, nor anger. He spoke matter of factly, but not as if to suggest impatience on his part. He spoke with the same kindness which emanated from that smile of his.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Two blasts out of the ferry’s horn, and I knew it was nearing time to set sail again. Café Guy knew it too, giving a couple of taps on the counter as if to hurry me along. *“What would you like sir? I can’t hang around here too long…”*

That put me off a little, wondering what his hurry was, but with my hunger drowning out any further sense of curiosity, I thought I’d best get my order in.

*“Um… give me three of those sausage rolls you gave that other guy, and maybe two of those chicken and mayo sandwiches.”*

I thought I’d best stock up a little, he seemed to only come by in the mornings, and not for very long. I then asked him how I might pay for these items, and he simply shook his head.

*“No payment sir, not necessary here,”* he replied, before continuing to hum that ridiculous tune of his.

He handed me the sandwiches and I tucked them under my arm, grabbing the cooked sausage rolls in my left hand as soon as they dinged out of the microwave. He then handed me a coffee, and I looked up at him with a questioning look on my face…

*“You look like you need one,”* he said, giving me a wink. 

I laughed and thanked him, before heading back downstairs. I noticed the now half full cabin of people down there, all sitting on the left hand side of the ferry. All of them were seated neatly in rows. Each time another one would board the ferry, it seemed they would sit directly to the right of the previous boarding passenger. If a row happened to be full, they would take a seat in the row directly behind. And there they would remain, either staring straight ahead, down at their feet, or munching on their food for the day. 

It was as though there were unspoken rules regarding the day to day order on board this ferry. The unquestioning obedience to these rules was making me feel more and more uneasy. 

Making my way down the aisle, I paused, taking a couple of steps back as I noticed that man from last night. But he was different now, his face sombre, looking down at his feet. A mindless drone just like the rest of them. I backed away, heading on over to the rear Starboard side of the ship and taking a seat against the far wall. I sat my sandwiches down on the seat next to me before ripping into one of the sausage rolls. Oh my God, let me tell you, at that point they tasted like heaven.

With my stomach full and satisfied, I decided I might head out on deck and get some fresh air. I shot a quick glance across the ferry, concerned that these people might take this opportunity to rob me of my food reserves. But there they sat, still looking dead ahead, or down at their feet. A few of them would occasionally give me those weirdly concerned looks, but they turned their gaze away as soon as I made eye contact with them. 

Still, I was worried about losing my food. Café Guy would surely not return until tomorrow morning, I thought, so I had to hide these precious supplies for later on. Removing my work shirt, I took a second to wrap my sandwiches up inside it and place them on the floor, shoving them discreetly underneath a seat against the wall. There, that should do it. 

I got up from my row of seats, taking a nice swig from my coffee as I made my way out onto the deck. With only a tank top on now, the fresh air against my skin felt wonderfully refreshing. We were sailing nearby Athol Bay, I noticed, as I made my way around the deck, catching sight of Whiting Beach not far away. I allowed myself a moment to feel relatively okay, delighting in the taste of the fresh coffee, the smell of the salty air, and the beautiful sights and sounds around me. The harbour was alive today, jet skis and tourist vessels cruised the waters, and the nearby Taronga Zoo was clearly a buzz with people. 

That had taken a minute to sink in, but it finally clicked… People! In stark contrast to the previous day where I had only been able to catch glimpses of shadows, remnants of a city once alive and vibrant. Today, that life had returned, and I realised in that moment, I was less than a kilometre from a return to this normal world.

I threw my coffee on the deck, and looked out straight ahead, focussing my attention on Whiting Beach. It was a straight shot, and I was a strong swimmer. I slowly crept my way up to the railings of the vessel and leaned over, looking down into the dark depths of Sydney Harbour. Goosebumps ran up my spine, prickling sharply in my neck as I envisioned how far down the bottom was. 

I could picture the sea floor in my mind. The coarse sand. The slimy seaweed. The bull sharks, with their beady eyes and keen senses waiting for any sign of movement on the surface. No… I couldn’t think about that right now. Shark attack statistics tell me I’ll most likely be okay. If I stayed on this ferry, on the other hand, there was no such chance.

I stepped one foot up onto the railing, gripping the top bar tightly as I swung my leg up and over it, the next one following close behind. My hands remained in a vice grip, as I slowly turned around to face the water. The ferry was moving quite slowly, and I could see some little critters swimming around down there as the wind blew softly against my face. It was still freezing, and I wondered if the water would be the same. I wondered if my body would shut down the moment I dived in, hypothermia taking me before the sharks even had a chance to. 

Shaking my head and dispelling these thoughts, I accepted the dark waters before me as the lesser of two dangers and prepared to jump. I felt my grip loosen, my hands letting go of the railing and leaning forward, when suddenly…

***“DON’T!”***

I reached back just in time to grab the railing and stop myself from falling. I spun around, darting my eyes in all directions, looking for the source of that voice. And there he was. Café Guy. No smile on his face this time, but a look of sadness and genuine concern for me.

***“DON’T… do that…”***

He spoke again, before turning and walking back inside, disappearing up the staircase within. I could only stare after him, a dumbfounded look on my face not unlike those slack jawed minions sitting inside. 

Defeated, I climbed back up and over the railing, landing back on deck with a thud. I turned back around, wanting to take in one last look at the world outside before resigning myself to my row of seats again, and I was met with a crushing reality. They were gone. The vibrant city which had just a moment ago surrounded me, filling me with hope… was gone. The beaches, the waterside walkways, the harbour itself… devoid of life once again. I lowered my head in defeat, genuinely contemplating hurling myself into the water and being done with it, facing whatever eventuality Café Guy so sternly warned me of. But no, I could not. While so ever there was still a chance, I had to hold on…

Feeling utterly deflated, I made my way back inside, taking up residence in my row of seats as the ferry began to make its way up and down the harbour again. Onwards we sailed, and as we made our way back down towards Darling Harbour, the ferry began pulling in and making stops at strange ports once more. Unlike last night, these were all stops that I recognised. But as the ferry docked in, it became evident that these were very different places from what I knew them to be. 

With a loud clunk, we came to a halt at Circular Quay, a stop where usually hundreds of passengers eagerly awaited ferries heading to various destinations. What I saw as I looked out the window, however, was little more than a floating, rusted out platform bobbing up and down in the harbour. It was more reminiscent of an oil rig than a modern ferry station. I watched as the big guy tossed out the foot ramp and more of these… “people”… shuffled their way onto the ferry. I avoided their gaze as they made their way inside, but I could feel their eyes burning into me as they slowly waddled past, joining the rest of the passengers in their rows of seats.

This happened over and over. Every stop we made, what I knew to be reality was simply not there. As we pulled into Milson’s Point, the dock now blackened and covered in disgusting barnacles, I reluctantly forced myself to look over toward Luna Park. No more was the colourful, welcoming theme park. In place of the Mr Moon face stood a set of huge, barbed wire gates twisting their way up skyward. I heard them rattle as people shuffled their way past them, some of them getting caught, yet still uselessly trying to walk away as the metal barbs hooked deeper into their flesh. 

The ferris wheel? A monstrosity of a contraption. Long, wiry arms were sticking out from a dilapidating screeching metal centre grinding around in circles. Each of these arms culminated in a scraggly mess of sharp, rusted steel. People were clung onto the ends of these arms going round and round, releasing awful screams as they went.

Where the big top once stood, was now a massive, run down wooden structure, kind of resembling a giant barn, rotted and decayed. Its enormous gates creaked open, and more of these human-resembling figures trudged their way out. They were running toward the ferry, some of them just making their way on board as Ramp Guy screamed at them to hurry up. The ones that didn’t make it in time just continued running off the edge of the dock and toppling into the harbour as the ferry pulled away. 

The next stop would be McMahons Point, and things did not improve upon the ferry’s arrival here. This spot was, for lack of a better word, dead. Where our previous stops I had been able to hear awful noises, here the figures just stood there and watched in silence. 

All along they jetty they stood, staring at us as we pulled in. The ramp was wheeled out, and still they did not move, nor make a sound. I watched on in horror as Ramp Guy stomped out onto the jetty and grabbed two of them by their arms. As he did so, their faces contorted into looks of sheer panic and they began to release ungodly screeches as they were dragged on board.

I quickly put my head down as Ramp Guy heaved them inside the cabin, a smirk present on his stupid face, before lugging them up the stairwell. I don’t know what happened after that. I saw Ramp Guy march back outside, and a few minutes later the two… “people”? Made their way back downstairs and quietly took their seats beside the rest of them. I just stared at them, confused as to what might have happened up there, as the ferry began to slowly drift away from the dock. I was snapped back into reality as a huge belly laugh erupted from out on the deck. 

Ramp Guy was pointing and laughing at something. I followed where he was pointing and was met with the sight of two people sitting in the… well, what used to be the James Lakin Chair. There was a man and a woman, quite obviously no longer among the living, as I noted the signs of decay present on their faces. The… “chair” they were seated on, was no chair at all, but something resembling a torture device of the middle ages. 

That wasn’t the worst part though. What still haunts me today was the looks of sheer joy on their faces, their smiles wide and their eyes even wider as they released unnatural sounding laughter. These long dead things, still somehow alive, were actually laughing and enjoying this visible agony.

I quickly turned away as Ramp Guy decided this was no longer amusing and spun back around, almost catching me staring at him. The dude scared me almost as much as what was outside. The ferry began to slowly drift toward the Barangaroo Docks, my nightmarish journey had begun two nights ago. It didn’t even resemble what it once looked like. The sleek modern ferry terminals one present there, gone. 

What stood in their place was like something straight out of a SAW film. Long, metal constructed tunnels. Many more of these once-human figures were lined up in these tunnels, screaming at the top of their lungs. I could not see what was happening inside there, but whatever it was, it was causing them immense pain and suffering. I shuddered to think what kind of deranged mind could conjure up a punishment so heinous it would make these things cry out in such pain. As we docked in, Ramp Guy hurling the foot bridge out over one of the docks, I watched as five of the figures of what I am sure were among hundreds casually and calmly strolled out from within the tunnels and made their way onto the ferry.

I looked away as they swaggered on past me, their flesh clearly burned, ripped and torn. I didn’t want to see anything more. This was too much. The crushing reality that I had very much ended up in some rupture of time and space, trapped here, perhaps forever, diminishing any sense of hope that remained within me. Any thoughts of escaping the ferry were fast drying up too. As scary as it was in here, I did not for one moment wish to face the hell that I was witnessing outside.

All day this went on, the ferry slowly continuing to fill up with more and more of these strange depictions of human beings. Usually, they would board the ferry quietly, making their way to their seats and sitting down. But there was one notable exception to this rule. I would become painfully aware that night that not all who board this vessel are harmless. 

I had just finished the second of my sandwiches when I realised what was happening. Gradually, the ferry’s motions became more violent, the boat rocking back and forth in clearly harsher seas. With a creeping horror, I realised we were once again making our way out of the harbour. The tall waves outside began to lash at the sides of the ship as I felt the captain swinging a hard right. I looked out the window. We were sailing south, the land clearly visible out the starboard side. I cringed back in my seat as we passed Bondi Beach. 

The once beautiful landscape was no more. The iconic grassy hills once surrounding the area were now dead and barren, sharp, rocky ridges overhanging the beach, if you could call it that. Slimy and murky was the ocean, dark, twisted humanoid figures flailing around in the waters. The fog once again thickened around us, and the frigid night air so alien for this time of year settled in and began creeping its way inside the cabin. I put my work shirt back on, trying to stay warm, and making a mental note to ask Café Guy for a bag tomorrow.

The ferry drifted on down the coast, shaking from side to side in by far the worst conditions I have ever experienced. The waves were monstrous now, and we weren’t even that far out. Every so often I would shoot a glance out the other side of the ferry to see towering walls of water smashing up against us, water pouring through the windows and drenching the mindless drones in the seats beside them. 

The ferry was tipping violently from left to right, so dangerously close to capsizing I could see the surface of the ocean right outside my window before the vessel would swing back the other way. Yet somehow, we remained topside. 

The journey past Coogee Beach was no better. The waters again filled with copious numbers of these things which only barely resembled human beings. Their arms and legs flapped helplessly around and they were swept up by the rough seas, many of them being pulled down underwater, never to come back up. The waves continued to grow more and more violent, and as we sailed away from that terrible place, the last thing I saw was a massive tsunami wave of murky water. Shadowy limbs bobbed up and out from within it, as it surged its way up onto the shoreline and flooded the suburbia beyond it with hordes of these… things.

Onwards we sailed, and after maybe another half an hour of our tiny vessel being tossed back and forth by waves so large we should have long since capsized, I felt the ferry swinging another hard right. The second we made that turn, an enormous crash of thunder erupted from the skies. This coincided with a blinding flash of lightning so close to us I cowered on the floor in terror, uselessly trying to protect myself from being fried to death.

Seconds later, however, as I pulled myself back up and looked out my window again, all was calm. No more violent waves. No more rough seas. Everything was still, and quiet. I stared out the window, the fog beginning to clear a little, and I noticed where we were. The ferry was sailing into Botany Bay.

As the ferry slowed its pace, the engine reducing to a low drone, I began to see things out the window that were just… impossible. I stumbled up the stairwell, making my way over to the Portside and sliding open the door to the upper deck. As we sailed along Prince Charles Parade, I looked up in absolute astonishment.

I was staring at the 100 foot mast of a colonial era British Naval vessel, the Union Jack waving in the cold winds. As the ferry crept its way around this thing, I could see faces, peeking curiously over the deck at me, as if I were the out of place object in this situation. The size and the awe of this thing made me feel like little more than a mouse. But this was far from the strangest thing I would see here.

As we sailed slowly further down the coast, I saw men clad in formal military dress of an age gone by scurrying around the sands, shouting orders and waving their weapons in the air as people dressed in little more than rags trudged their way across the beach, their arms and legs chained. It had of course dawned on me by this point, as unbelievably impossible as it was to accept, I was somehow witnessing the landing of The First Fleet.

Another towering navy ship up ahead dwarfed our tiny ferry, and feeling dizzy from the sheer enormity of it, I stumbled my way back inside, slumping down into my chair. I continued to watch out the window as this bizarre historical flashback unfolded before me.

*“Lift ’im up, ya lazy sods!”* I heard shouted from a little ways up the bank, as a small group of men attempted to erect a shelter, their legs still bound by chains. *“Put yer backs into it aye ‘e ain’t gettin’ no lighter!”*

I continued to watch in shock as the two soldiers supervising this group began to whip the men as they worked. Down on their knees they would fall, only to force themselves back up as the cat-o’-nines fell upon their backs with a series of awful cracks over and over again.

The ferry continued to sneak its way around the towering navy ships docked in the bay, the creaking of their giant wooden frames echoing out through the night. We were sailing along The Grand Parade now. A little ways up the shoreline I noticed a number of formal dressed men, perhaps Officers, were exchanging gestures and small gifts with a small clan of Indigenous Australians as soldiers and convicts alike scurried around the hillside trying to establish a basecamp. A futile endeavour which would soon be abandoned in favour of greener pastures.

A little further up the bay, my stomach turned as I gazed upon the sickening sight of a group of prisoners on their knees. Two soldiers stood before them, their weapons trained. I looked away, hiding my eyes and blocking my ears in anticipation of what this meant. I kept my senses as dulled as possible, as five distinct shots rang out through the night. I felt tears running through the cracks in my fingers as the reality of what had just happened echoed through my head. 

More frantic shouts from the men outside snapped my attention back to the surreal happenings, and I saw a few of them waving to the ferry, signalling it to stop, it would seem. I shuddered at the thought of this. Surely there was no way we would actually pull in here after what had just happened. A familiar creak of straining metal proved that hope woefully wrong, as the ferry swung around and began slowing as it neared the shoreline. I sunk back into my seat, making myself as small as possible. 

Slowly and carefully, I peeked out the window as I felt the ferry jerk to one side, its anchor hitting the floor of the bay. There stood Ramp Guy. He gave the anchor a couple of firm tugs, before standing up and waving his arms in the air, as the men below wheeled a gigantic ramp of their own up along the shoreline, sliding its top edge over the deck of the ferry. I pulled my head away from the window again as I heard the sounds of chains making their way up the ramp, dragging across the deck, and eventually, a series of loud clangs as the chains fell free.

*“Thank you Officers,”* Ramp Guy said menacingly. I heard boots stomping back down the ramp and off into the distance, and soon after, the sound of the anchor being reeled back in. I felt almost relieved as the ferry began to pull away from this awful scene. That is until I heard the sound of footsteps clunking up the internal stairwell toward me.

I turned away, focussing my attention out the window, not wanting to look at who, or what, was coming up those stairs. In the vague reflection of the window, I noticed figures. Merely outlines was all I could see, moving their way through the cabin. They took over two rows of seats behind me, a few rows back. There were numerous men, four or five in number, and they did not sound friendly. 

They spoke in Cockney accents, talking back and forth between themselves regarding their alleged crimes, which I will not repeat here, so heinous in nature they were. I tried to sink lower and lower in my seat, hoping I would go unnoticed, but alas, after a few minutes of bantering between themselves, their voices became hushed. They began to speak in harsh whispers, ominous in tone, and with clearly sinister intent. Me, the obvious target of these intentions. 

My heart began to race as I heard them stand up from their rows of seats. I looked around for anything I might use as a weapon to defend myself, but I found nothing, settling in the end for the keys in my pocket. I carefully grabbed them out, and firmly wedged one key between my fingers in a tightly clenched fist. I heard footsteps approaching, and I heard the men’s voices erupt into a violent shout. I grabbed the back of the seat in front of me, about to get up and bury my makeshift weapon into whatever was standing before me, when all of a sudden, the door to the Captain’s quarters swung open!

I did not look, for what I saw merely out of the periphery of my vision was enough to dissuade me. 

Something tall, unnaturally so, stood in the doorway. 

I sat back down in my seat, and I stared straight ahead, refusing to look. My attackers stood frozen in place, as this figure took heavy steps, very slowly, toward them. 

***Clomp…***

***Clomp…***

***Clomp…***

His, or perhaps its boots stomped ominously down the aisle before coming to a halt just a couple of steps away from the men. 

I carefully shifted my eyes to the point I could just see what was happening. They were all standing about a foot behind me, so I could make out figures, but nothing more. 

This… thing. He? It? Whatever… was **massive**. The head brushed against the roof of the ceiling as it stared down at these men who cowered in fear before it. Whatever this was, it was not the Captain. Up ahead, he still stood firm behind the wheel, never wavering, just staring out into the dark seas before us. As I sat there, frozen in my place, I heard the sounds of footsteps, a group of them, tapping their way across the floor to the other side of the ferry. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the five men ever so quietly take their seats, and stare down at their feet. 

I quickly averted my eyes as massive footfalls began making their way back this way. I heard them stop. Right beside me. I then felt something staring at me. I began to shake where I sat, praying this thing would just go away. And it was then that a deep, awful voice spoke one word…

*“Interesting”*…

And then, without anything further, it simply walked away, the door to the Captain’s quarters slamming behind it. 

I completely broke down at this point, falling out of my chair and collapsing onto the floor. I stared up at the ceiling, too exhausted to care about what was happening around me anymore. How in the hell was I here?! I don’t care. What in the hell was happening?! No. I simply did not have the energy to give a damn. I curled up where I lay, watching out the upper rear doors as the ocean began to show its fury once again. I just stared at those vicious waves outside, morbidly mesmerised by their motions, and wondering where on earth we were now, until I finally managed to succumb to sleep.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

I was blasted out of sleep by an unusually loud eruption from the blower. Checking my watch, I saw it was around two in the morning. What the hell was going on now? I thought, as I pulled myself together and got up off the floor. I glanced over to the other side of the ship. The five men from earlier were still in their seats, hunched over and sleeping. I rubbed my eyes…

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

What the…?! That wasn’t from the ferry… it was too loud. The sounds from the ocean chop were louder now too, savage waves ripping their way over the surface.

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

Louder now! What the hell is doing that?! I grabbed the door handle and slid open the side door to the upper deck, stepping outside into the frosty night air. I noticed a bright light as I stepped out, grabbing the railing to steady myself, and I made my way up to the front of the upper deck.

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!! Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

In one panicked moment, my eyes rose up to meet the sight of the enormous cargo ship carving its way through the ocean straight towards us!

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!! Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

There was no time to even think. I ran, and I dived off the side of that accursed ferry, smashing head first into the blackness of the pacific ocean. 

***SPLASH!!!***

I wasted no time as I crashed through the surface. I flailed my arms and kicked my legs as fast as I was humanly capable, trying to swim down as deep as possible and put as much distance as I could between me and the monstrosity above me. I did not open my eyes, and I tried not to think about the sheer depth of what I was slowly disappearing into. I felt my body almost snap in half as I was violently pulled into a current of water as this thing flew past above me. 

I was suddenly enveloped in darkness, as its massive form bulldozed over the ocean’s surface, and I was tossed around like a rag in a washing machine for what felt like minutes on end, before being finally released, floating helplessly there in the depths. For whatever strength I had left I pulled myself up toward the surface, the moonlit night thankfully giving me some form of direction. I kicked and swam with all my might until finally I broke through the surface. 

Immediately, I began looking around for the wreck. I had to find something, anything to grab onto. Some rogue piece of broken ferry that I could at least float on top of, or ideally a stray life jacket. I looked around as far as my eyes could see, searching for anything that might do the trick.

*No…*

I looked out toward the moonlit horizon…

*No!*

I snapped my eyes around to both sides…

***NO!***

I shot a frantic look around behind me and in all directions…

***NOOOO!!!!!!!***

There was no wreck. There was no cargo ship. And the ferry was gone.",1,1766208281.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1pr6ik6,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1pr6ik6/welp_long_rant/,Welp. (long rant),"I’m pretty sure i’m on the fast track to being fired. I’ve been a barista going on 2 months now and I must admit I’m just simply terrible at the job. I’m mostly placed on dto/dtr, front register and SOMETIMES warming and rarely if ever put on hot bar/cold bar. I have IMMENSE difficulty with memorizing drinks (iced brown sugar shaken being my biggest opp), and my team + sm just flat out dislike me and are super frustrated with me.

I understand to an extent, I had to ask how I was supposed to make a batch of green tea base today (first time i ever made one. which was quite embarrassing), messed up on prepping some coffee travelers yesterday (which was my first time ever making those as well, to be fair i also had to service a large influx of customers that came in yesterday, most of which were buyin’ a crap ton of gift cards and merchandise for xmas), and i tend to get overwhelmed easily whenever we get a large influx of orders and im on cold bar/warming (frappuccinos are also my biggest opp on cold bar, ESPECIALLY during rushes. they’re not hard to make just tedious when you have a lot to make!) amongst other things as well. im also on the autism spectrum so i can be prone to sensory overload and i also blank out sometimes.

I’m pretty good at making teas, refreshers and basic coffees. I feel like I’m getting a little better at warming during rushes, and I’m very good at making customer connections, so much so that i’ve gotten a hug from a customer recently because i was so good to them :,) but I feel like none of that is ever acknowledged whatsoever, just my mistakes and fumbles.

On top of that our store is transitioning to being open 24/7, and recently I updated my availability to exclude any overnight shifts. I overheard that people got their schedules already for january, but i see that i’m only scheduled up to the 4th and after that i got nothin’. When i was hired initially they had asked me if i was interested in any overnight shifts and i had made it abundantly clear that i would NOT be able to work overnights due to various reasons. But apparently they expected the new recently hired baristas to be the dedicated night crew (which i was NOT told about at all, again i was just asked if i’d be interested in working nights).

i also have a skill check that i have to take which i’m pretty sure i’m going to fail, ESPECIALLY since i have the least amount of hot bar time compared to the other newbies. i don’t mean to be sour grapes about the whole thing, but a part of me feels like I’m treated a little unfairly compared to the other new hires and I was kinda set up to fail. I’m told to ask questions yet get eyerolls and told “you should already know this” whenever i DO have questions, I’m not allowed to use recipe cards, I’m constantly met with attitudes and disrespect along with a whole plethora of other things, and its hard not to let it bother me because it does.

overall, i think atp i just accepted that this is probably whats going to happen and y’know thats okay. it doesn’t surprise me one bit, I am a little disappointed but it is what it is. what’s important is i tried and in the end i’ll be alright :) starbucks is definitely a different beast and not for everyone and thats okay. on to the next thing i suppose.",0,1766208238.0,starbucksbaristas,0,0.5,False

## --[ 1 - The Spectrum Situation

    you're in spectrum mode. grinding XP. living the dream.
    +1 XP triggers level-up. pig celebrates with 2.5s blocking popup.
    from WiFi callback context. from the freeway at rush hour.
    watchdog timer knew the rules. so did the pig.
    ...
    pig didn't level up to L2. pig got full DSM-5 L2.
    pig ran around and crashed you.
    screaming.

    reproduced. fixed. pig levels up. DSM-5 not involved.
    
    (we see you. we're probably you.
    hacker rpg tamagotchi release posted at 5am.

    CRASHES FIXED:
    - spectrum levelup crash: XP popup from WiFi callback. watchdog. fixed.
    
    NAVIGATION FIXED:
    - backtick in client monitor: went to main menu. gaslighting. toxic shit. fixed.
    
    NEW FEATURES:
    - about screen: shows commit hash instead of build date. blame has receipts.
    - client monitor: 4 MAC octets instead of 2. double the intel.
    - client monitor: SSID shows 22 chars instead of 15. names matter.
    
    UI CONSISTENCY:
    - zeros: N:015, D:0042, HS:003 - 15 zeros deployed, military grade
    - DNH: stops doing macarena on channel 9->10
    - colons: deployed where colons belong
    - units: KM, M, SAT stand tall
    - dB stays lowercase - the B is for Bel. science doesn't negotiate.
    - UI SCREAMS IN UPPERCASE - settings stay lowercase, sanctuary
    
    One shot. One opportunity. To seize all the zeros you ever wanted.

    to the pigfarmer who leveled up in spectrum and got rebooted.
    your sacrifice taught us about interrupt context.

    to everyone who reports bugs instead of silently reflashing.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pr6bug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentaHealth/comments/1pr6bug/5_ways_to_build_radical_acceptance_into_your/,5 Ways to Build Radical Acceptance Into Your Daily Life,"

Radical Acceptance or the practice of completely accepting the reality of a situation, even when it's painful or unwanted. It's a key skill from DBT, and it's essential for reducing suffering and moving forward. 

Here are 5  ways to integrate radical acceptance into your daily routine. 

1. The Morning ""Check-In & Label""
Practice: Before checking your phone, observe your internal state (e.g., anxiety, tiredness).

The Acceptance: Label the emotion without judgment: ""I am experiencing anxiety this morning. This is my reality.""

Benefit: Prevents secondary suffering (being angry at yourself for feeling anxious), freeing up mental energy.

2. The ""Accept, Cope, Move"" Drill
Practice: When something frustrating happens (spilled coffee, late meeting), use this mental drill:

🛑 ACCEPT: Acknowledge the fact immediately: ""This happened.""

⚠️ COPE: Use a mantra: ""I can handle this.""

✅ MOVE: Take the next necessary action.

Benefit: Stops you from wasting energy fighting an unchangeable reality, channeling it into positive action.

3. The ""It Makes Sense"" Compassion Frame
Practice: When dealing with painful situations or past mistakes, seek the chain of events that led to them.

The Acceptance: Frame the situation with understanding: ""Given the circumstances (the lack of sleep, the stress), it makes sense that I [made that error/reacted that way].""

Benefit: Replaces blame with insight. Acceptance comes easier when you understand why something is.

4. Use Physical Cues (Unclench and Relax)
Practice: Identify your body's resistance (clenched jaw, tight shoulders).

The Acceptance: Treat physical tension as an alert. Consciously release the tension and internally state: ""I accept this situation right now.""

Benefit: Radical acceptance is physical, too. Relaxing your body reinforces the mental decision to stop resisting the present moment.

5. The Daily ""Unchangeable Reality"" Inventory
Practice: Review 2-3 things that caused pain today that you absolutely could not change (e.g., the weather, someone else's choice).

The Acceptance: For each, state: ""I fully accept that [X] happened. I choose to release the struggle against it.""

Benefit: Reinforces the difference between problems needing action and realities needing acceptance, allowing you to leave the day's baggage behind.

The backstory:

I met someone a few months ago here on Reddit and we had a lovely coffee date. It led to some spicy things in a parking garage and followed with plenty of sexy conversations over Telegram about what we’d do next. Not long after we met, he flagged that things were chaotic in his life and he needed to take a step back to regroup. We reconnected a few weeks later (I initiated) and made a plan to meet up again for a longer, more intense session.

We planned a hotel meet a month in advance. Our conversations leading up to it detailed all the filthy things we’d do to one another. Then we started counting down the days and reminding one another like some fucked up adultery advent calendar.

The hotel meet happened and it wasn’t exactly electric. He was generous and I tried to be too but things just weren’t… connecting, if ya know what I mean. I chalked it up to nerves and performance anxiety from both sides but figured we’d work through it.

In our text debrief after the meet, he said he didn’t feel like there was sexual chemistry. He said he didn’t feel the way he did during that initial coffee date and he was unsure if he wanted to continue exploring with me. I expressed my disappointment but made it clear I respected his feelings, however it landed. I gave him space for a couple days. I posted a new ad here on Reddit because I thought that might distract me because I was feeling rejected and hurt. Tonight I got the dreaded “I wish you the best” text. When I opened it, I could see that I was blocked.

I’m a very empathetic person and even when things haven’t worked out with other connections and I’ve candidly told them so, I’ve never blocked them. I’ve always held space for them to respond because I feel like they deserve that.

So if you are the type to block someone after a “sorry bye” sort of text, why? OPSEC? Mental bandwidth?

*December 20, 2025 – MHP Arena, Stuttgart*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that could make a kindergarten art class look monochromatic: **VfB Stuttgart** (2.05) vs. **TSG Hoffenheim** (3.3). The odds? Stuttgart’s home form is as reliable as a coffee addict’s morning routine—nine wins in 10 games. But Hoffenheim, darlings of the “surprise Champions League qualifiers” narrative, aren’t here to play nice.

### Key Stats to Know

* **Deniz Undav** (Stuttgart): 8 goals, 16 shots on goal. His price to score anytime? A steal at **-106** on Bovada.
* **Fisnik Asllani** (Hoffenheim): 6 goals in 14 games. His anytime goal odds? **+155** on DraftKings.
* **Both Teams to Score**: At **8/15** (implied probability: **61.5%**), bookmakers are betting on a fireworks show. Seven of the last eight meetings have had **at least two teams scoring**.

### Why This Game is a Betters’ Playground

* **Stuttgart’s Shot Differential**: +3.4 per game. They’re like a 3D printer—*precision*.

1pr67xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pr67xb/romy_story/,[RO]My Story,"# The Day You Stopped Writing Back

I met her in a place where people usually wait for endings.

The hospital library smelled like antiseptic and dust, and no one ever stayed longer than necessary. I was there to avoid going home. She was there because home had already become too quiet.

She sat across from me, legs folded, reading a book she wasn’t really reading. Every few seconds, she glanced at the window, as if the light outside was something she needed to memorize.

“You know,” she said without looking at me, “people come here only when they’re afraid.”

I didn’t answer. I wasn’t good at conversations then. Still not, if I’m honest.

She smiled anyway. Not the kind that asks for a response. The kind that understands silence.

That’s how it started—no fireworks, no destiny. Just two people sharing borrowed time.

She talked like time was a rumor she didn’t believe in.

She made lists of things she wanted to do: eat street food at midnight, walk in the rain without an umbrella, laugh loudly in quiet places. Small rebellions against an invisible clock.

“Promise me something,” she said one evening as we sat on the hospital steps.  
“What?”  
“Don’t treat me like I’m dying.”

I promised. It was the only lie I told her.

She taught me how to live like tomorrow was optional.

We skipped classes. Watched movies on cracked phone screens. She leaned her head on my shoulder during the sad parts and laughed during the happy ones, as if she was deliberately confusing fate.

Sometimes I forgot she was sick. Sometimes she did too.

But at night, when she thought I was asleep, her breathing changed. Became careful. Measured. Like every breath needed permission.

That’s when I learned the worst kind of pain isn’t loud.  
It’s quiet.  
Polite.  
Patient.

I never said I loved her.

Not because I didn’t.  
But because love felt like a promise, and promises felt cruel.

She said it instead—casually, like she was commenting on the weather.

“I think I love you,” she said, watching pigeons scatter in the courtyard.

I froze.

She laughed. “Relax. I’m not asking for anything. I just wanted you to know.”

That was her gift.  
Loving without demanding to be kept.

The last message she sent me was unfinished.

>

No period. No goodbye.

Just a sentence waiting for a future that never arrived.

I reread it every night, hoping the rest of the words will appear if I stare long enough.

They never do.

People told me time would help.

They were wrong.

Time doesn’t heal.  
It just teaches you how to carry the weight without dropping it in public.

Sometimes I still save a seat beside me.  
Sometimes I order two coffees.  
Sometimes I hear her voice when it rains.

And sometimes—this is the worst part—I smile at something beautiful and immediately feel guilty for surviving it.

I keep her lists in my drawer.

I’ve completed most of them. Not because I wanted to, but because someone had to finish what she started.

There’s only one thing left.

At the bottom of the page, written smaller than the rest:

*“Be remembered without being pitied.”*

So this is me remembering her.

Not as a tragedy.  
Not as a lesson.  
But as a girl who lived fiercely, loved quietly, and left too early—  
taking a piece of my ordinary life with her.

And if there’s another place beyond this one, I hope she’s laughing there,  
complaining about how long it took me to understand what mattered.",3,1766207283.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

My husband is can be lazy at times and is very forgetful. He’s also not considerate, not protective of me at all or our marriage, and has controlling ways about finances. He’s the type that if I buy a coffee today, he thinks we won’t be able to afford a house years down the line I think what I’m feeling is burn out. Whenever I bring up how I’m feeling, he gets offended?? It’s like talking to a brick wall. I’m tired of asking things of husband and just being responsible for everything, emotionally and physically. I’ve lost my glow and I desperately need it back. I need my own space for a while so I applied for an apartment a few days ago and was approved. The lease is for a year. I told my husband today and I felt like he was trying to talk me out of moving. He brought up a lot of hypotheticals and said it‘s a bad idea. I reassured him that me moving out temporarily doesn’t mean I want a divorce or that I want to see other people or anything like that. I just want to try anything to get out of this horrible place in our marriage. I don’t like the person I’ve become and he doesn’t like who he’s become. He doesn't get it and believes things will end. He’s afraid of the unknown. Again, I reassured him that we will have a plan. I asked (begged) for his support and for him to just trust me. Him not supporting me is what I feel will end our marriage, not me moving out temporarily.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

There are also some pretty cool art exhibits at the jmac studio with free snacks that I like to go to. There are also art classes at the art museum that are free for low income. I like to have fires and I have a yard with a little firepit. I dont always have to be doing something super interesting, involved, or expensive.

Its kind of hard because there is this stigma that just because you dont work you wouldn't make a good friend. Also when you're not out all day working and going to school its harder to make friends. 

Vaping smoking cigarettes or weed and sometimes drinking are ok around me if we are out but they are not allowed inside my house. I prefer to be away from hard drugs. I chew nicotine gum and drink moderately once or twice a month but thats about it for me. I am not aggressive when I drink but I can be goofy.

Ive been to Graphic design school. A cashier a waitress and a telemarketer. Sold vintage things for a while. And most recently was a Real Estate Agent before things went wrong. Im looking to be involved with chronic illness peer support in the future. 

I currently am not driving because its just not worth it to pay for a car and insurance while I am not working. I take ubers and find it to be much more efficient. 

I always wear sweatpants and sneakers so I prefer not to go anywhere too fancy. As far as looks go im probably a 5 right now. So if you want  to enter a beauty pagent or become Instagram models together im probably not the one.

1pr621k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1pr621k/e9_please_help_with_my_instinctual_stacking_im/,[E9] Please help with my instinctual stacking! I'm going crazy! [LONG],"Hi everyone,

I'm going crazy trying to determine my instinctual stacking and am looking for some help.

I'm quite confident that so>sp because I pay much more attention to so resources AND I tend to prioritize so-related concerns over sp-related concerns in action.

This gives the following possible stackings.

so/sp

so/sx

sx/so

I will write a description of my relationship to each of the instincts to help explain.



SP

I am competent at this instinct but I understand that this is NOT an indicator of where it is in one's stack. Simply put, I don't care if someone takes care of sp-related tasks for me. I'm 30 and still living at home. I want to move out because my relationship with my mom is becoming difficult and it's making it hard to live in peace. I don't really care about moving out to become self-sufficient or ""assert myself in life"", I only want to move-out to get away from her negative psychological influence. I also care a little about what social and romantic interests think of me still living at home (#loser LOL).

I have difficulty sustaining effort for something practical when the ultimate reward is my well-being. I don't go to the gym (I'm a healthy weight anyway). I don't want to even THINK about cooking or diet or fitness etc. (give me an all-in-one nutrition pill please). The thought of going through the process to buy a house makes me roll my eyes (imagine my surprise when I learnt that it *doesn't* come with furniture. I mean seriously???). I don't care about learning ""survival skills"" or doing DIY stuff (in-fact, it REALLY frustrates me.)

I am good at sticking to personal goals and like to challenge myself and am competitive when it comes to certain things such as chess, tennis, videogames, academic performance - being good at my interests makes me feel good. However, I hide/ignore my competitiveness whenever it would directly threaten so or sx matters i.e. I would much rather ""play nice"" than win and cause discomfort. (this is probably type 9 thing in general though?). I don't challenge myself all the time and I don't always have goals.

I have reasonable awareness of my body and sensations (thirst, sleep, hunger, physical sensation). It annoys me that these senses affect my mood and take my attention away from more important things. I am conscious of packing enough clothes, food and water when I go out but I do this with the least effort possible (this might be the ""flavor of the 9"" showing [How to instincts part II : r/Enneagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/11gpwl1/how_to_instincts_part_ii/)).

I am quite conscious of money and don't like wasting it or spending it *too* frivolously because it feels shameful. This might just be because I was raised by someone who had a similar relationship with money. If spending money is related to other people, such as doing activities or going to dinner, then I don't mind too much, but if it's spending on something for myself, then I can be a bit neurotic about it. I don't think about money on my own volition or ""out of the blue"". I don't really care about *making* more money, only not wasting it when I have to spend it. I have enough money to live comfortably - I'm not living paycheck-to-paycheck (if this provides some context).

Final thoughts: although I'm good at this instinct I find it boring, unfulfilling and a bit of a chore. If I could ignore sp needs without starving to death or being homeless I would. I attend to them as necessary and with minimal effort (excepting my competitive interests if they qualify as sp).



SO

Ever since I was young I've had a desperate need to be liked by people. I've always been sensitive about what others thought of me. I want everyone to like me but what's most important is that they don't *dislike* me. I don't care about having a deep bond with everyone, I just want people in general to treat me positively. Honestly, I don't even like most people (they're boring, annoying, shallow) but I still feel this need to be liked by them.

If I can't connect with someone I often blame myself. If I sense that someone dislikes me, I try to win them over. My desire to avoid being disliked is MUCH stronger than my desire to be positively liked ""for who I am"". I feel anguished and devasted when people actively dislike me. Naturally I like to tease people but I often don't because I'm too afraid of hurting their feelings. I only tease people who I'm really close with. I feel embarrassed about showing interest in people, even platonically, and I adjust myself to other people based on their interests. It's all about them.

I'm generally a very open person. I go along to get along and don't do anything to disrupt the group atmosphere. I'm aware of social dynamics and how to act. I notice people in the environment and I'm aware of social signaling, etiquette and body-language. In social environments, I want to fit-in and not create awkwardness. I rarely give my honest opinion for fear of causing disruption which is why I really value people around whom I can be more myself.

Socializing with people generally isn't that nourishing to me. I rarely find fulfilment from it but maybe this is because I haven't found people who I truly get along with...When I have a positive social interaction or if I tell a joke which makes everyone laugh, it boosts my mood for the rest of the day. But this pleasure feels shallow and somewhat empty, like beating a difficult boss in a video game. It feels good for a time, but ultimately it doesn't really matter.

I often have imaginary conversations with people where I discuss topics that I enjoy (books, movies etc.). This gives me pleasure. Often, my thoughts are couched in the context of a conversation with someone else i.e. if I'm trying to understand my opinion on something, I will have an imaginary conversation with someone about it and I can gauge their reaction this way. I don't know what to make of this tbh - could be a 9 thing.

Lastly, I don't really care about bigger-picture social concepts like politics, society, culture. I'm not a part of any teams, clubs, social groups etc. and I don't feel any motivation to join any.

Final thoughts: As much as I generally prefer not to be around other people, they seem inextricably linked to me. I like being liked and it makes me feel good about myself. I would feel lonely without other people.



SX

Okay buckle-up. This is where it gets good (and by good I mean desperate, humiliating and pathetic). This is the instinct which feels most intense by far. Let me explain.

My most severe complexes and insecurities have always been related to whether women desire me or not. I am pathetically obsessed about my physical attractiveness, which is made worse by the fact that I'm not conventionally attractive (though I desperately try to convince myself that I am). It matters so much to me because I believe it could prevent me from getting the women I want. If a woman I desire rejects me because I'm not physically attractive enough, I feel that there's nothing I can do (this would be devastating). If it's related to my personality, that wouldn't bother me so much, because I believe I could simply change myself to win her affection. (I believe that it would be possible for me to morph into a completely different person, although some people are easier for me to become than others). I have spent countless nights, hours and tears, distraught and depressed over my prospects with women. If I feel undesirable, my life loses it's meaning. Nothing will make me feel better, nothing will ever feel good again unless I can convince myself that it's possible for women to desire me.

When I'm in public, my attention is automatically attuned to women. I was having lunch with friends at a busy shopping mall yesterday, and while we were talking I couldn't help constantly glancing at the pretty women who were walking by. My friends were a secondary consideration. A few years ago I went on a holiday to Germany for \~2 weeks, and I couldn't even focus on ""enjoying it"" because I was utterly obsessed with whether German women found me attractive or not: ""Are they different to the women in my home country? Maybe *these* women will find me attractive."" When I remember that trip, I don't remember the landmarks, the culture or the good times with friends, I remember only the pain and jealousy I felt when a woman looked at my friend instead of me, or I remember the ecstasy and euphoria on the rare occasions it was *me* who she was looking at. When I walk down the street in my city, I can't help glancing at every attractive woman who walks by, hoping that they make eye contact with me. When they do, even if it's only for a split second, I feel absolutely incredible. My day immediately becomes joyful. However, I doubt what it really means (and rightly so, not everyone is obsessive like me). I analyze this from every possible angle. I put myself in the shoes of a bystander watching the interaction: What would they have thought? Was it just a casual glance or a look of desire? Could she have been looking at something behind me? I would try and remember the EXACT way she looked at me. Was I looking at her first? Did she look away? How long did she hold eye contact? etc. etc. If I find that it was likely a look of desire, I try to commit it to my memory as precisely as I can so I can relive it again in the future and boost my self-esteem. However, often women don't make eye-contact (which is natural of course and likely has nothing to do with me at all).  Yet, there was a period of a couple of years were this had caused me to lose so much confidence that I would deliberately *avoid* eye-contact so I wouldn't be constantly faced with ""rejection"".

I've always been in love with women. I fall in love with women very easily: women on the street, women in coffee shops, women at work, parasocial relationships online...I feel that there is something in them that is the key to my happiness. Needless to say I am strongly limerent. Right now I have crush on a woman at work, and I swear it feels that she is attached to me by taught metal wires which dig into my heart. They respond to every movement she makes and the sound of her voice, and the flesh of my heart is pulled and tugged this way and that. I feel jealous when I see that she prefers others to me and I feel euphoric whenever we have a positive interaction (which is desperately use to convince myself of her attraction/preference for me). I know it's unhealthy but I can't help it. I try to distance myself and try to tell myself that she's just a person like anyone else but it doesn't work. I'm hopelessly attached to her. I'm almost certain she doesn't like me romantically, but it feels absolutely essential that there is some hope that it's possible, that I can win her over. Recently, it was looking quite possible that I'd be losing my job and it didn't really bother me that I'd be unemployed or that I'd have to find another job, what upset me most was that I wouldn't be able to see her anymore. I have countless other examples of limerence but to keep this short, just know that I have always been in-love with someone, or rather my fantasy of them. (But is love not fantasy?)

Despite all my intense feelings around women and desire, I am hilariously inexperienced, incompetent and fearful when it comes to attracting them. I've never had a girlfriend, never been on a date, and my only kiss was a peck on the lips when I was 17 from a girl who wanted to steal my first kiss. I don't peacock/display myself because it makes me feel uncomfortable. ""What if they reject me?"" I don't put my flavor forward very much and I essentially neutralize who I am. When it comes to romantic relationships, I very much live in the realm of imagination (it's safer). The logistics and practical realities of seduction feel alien to me. I simply expect that someone will be attracted to me (for some reason or other) and that my open and receiving nature will enable them to move closer to me. I'm awkward and scared and self-conscious. I wouldn't even know how to kiss a date goodbye. I feel embarrassed about pursuing women and I feel ashamed about the comments my friends or others might make. ""Oh look at hearlr, he's trying to flirt with her. \*smirk\*"" I would feel extremely self-conscious so I don't do it. I also fear excluding other people, or being rude, inconsiderate or creepy if I were to action my sexual pursuits. Generally I interact with women in a way that's more social, receptive and open, rather than the more galvanizing, push-pull, attract/repel style I often hear attributed to sx-doms. (Is this because I'm a 9 or sx-blind?).

For those who agree with the notion that sx is more than sexual competition, I relate to the notion of being personally transformed, possessed, revising my sense of self. (This is often through women I love). I am very introspective. I write 50k-100k words in my journal every year. My entries revolve mostly about who I am, personality, women and love. I love Proust and Virginia Woolf because they both delve deeply into the nature of ourselves. Proust has especially changed who I am and how I experience the world at an almost fundamental level (I'm even learning French to read him again). I often feel that I could dissolve into the love of a woman and completely disappear and I would be happy (but I feel fear of rejection also). I would be happy to be completely possessed by someone I love.

  


CLOSING THOUGHTS

I think my stacking hinges on how one views my relationship with sx. It feels too extreme for it to be my second instinct. I could see sx being my blind spot considering how many negative feelings I have surrounding it, but this could also point to it being my dominant. I'm horribly incompetent at it. All things being equal, sx takes most of my attention with so being close behind. My actions are generally in accordance with so, however sx feels much more intense and ""higher stakes"". As for sp, it feels relatively neutral and important...until I'm forced to deal with it hahaha.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pr61xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pr61xo/i_was_born_twelve_minutes_after_midnight/,I was born twelve minutes after midnight,"[Previous Year's Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hicdd6/i_was_born_twelve_minutes_after_midnigh)

Tom has been unstoppable.  *I* feel unstoppable.  I also maybe want to vomit because I’m so nervous and so scared, but you know, it’s all a balancing act.  Gotta psych myself up enough to go through with this.  Because this year… I’m not running.

I’m getting a little ahead of myself.  I was born twelve minutes after midnight, or at least, that’s what my birth certificate says.  The truth is that I was born at midnight, dead, until the doctor that delivered me pulled me out of death’s grip and brought me back to my parents.  Literally.  Literally pulled me out of a void and back into the world of the living.  But there are consequences to defying the natural order of things, though.  Every year, on my birthday, during those twelve minutes in which I was dead, the void gets a chance to drag me back in.

It’s been getting stronger.  For years I thought it was because I was getting older but… I met the doctor that saved me, just as he’d been saved himself as a child.  And he told me - before he gave himself up to oblivion - that the death that followed me was so much bigger than the one that had followed him.

And now, thanks to my friends Tom and Susan, we’re one step closer to understanding why that is.

Tom and Susan are both nurses at the hospital where I was born.  Last year, Tom had an idea that I wouldn’t just outrun the void, but that I’d let it catch up and in the last few seconds before it vanished, I’d pull someone out.  It was terrifying.  It was an idiotic risk.  And it worked.  I seized someone, a young father who had been in the room below mine when I was born and died for no reason other than the proximity to the void, and dragged him out.  We got him home and it was like he’d never died.  Like he’d never even been gone.  Just as reality had written people out of existence, it at least was willing to write this person back in.  I gave him his life back.  Then Tom, flush with victory, proposed Phase 2 of his plan.

He’d had it in the back of his head, from the moment he met me.  And after the holidays wound down, we all met up at his apartment to talk through about what had happened.  The person I’d rescued from the void was not among us.  Susan had reached out, but he’d declined to have anything more to do with us.  With… *this.*  None of us blame him.  He has a family, he has a newborn to worry about.  That’s enough.  I can’t really expect himself to put his life on the line when he had nothing to do with this other than being unfortunate enough to be sitting close enough for the vortex to reach out and snag.  No, the people that will be risking themselves to… stop this thing… will be us.

Because Tom does want to stop it.

*I* want to stop it.  I just haven’t thought that was possible until now.

“We know there’s a multitude of people inside that vortex,” Tom said, after we’d all settled at the kitchen table with our hot cocoa.  “And they’re people that it has swallowed that perhaps shouldn’t have died when they did.”

“What I don’t understand is why some people vanish,” Susan said.  “Like the doctor.  And your friend.”

I’d told them what happened to my friend, all those years back when she went running with me.  How it was like she’d never existed at all.

“I think it has to do with me,” I said.  “It erased the doctor back to the point of when he was *supposed* to die.  And it’s trying to erase me as well, and in my case it’s at the point of my birth. So when it took my friend in my place… it erased her like she’d never been born at all.”

Everyone else had just been caught up in its radius, like the new father I’d rescued just a few weeks prior.  We were quiet for a moment, considering this.  It’d taken so many people over the years, all of them from that one hospital, in its pursuit of me.  I won’t lie that I’ve struggled with this.  Sometimes, late at night, I think that maybe I should just… stop.  Stop running.  Stop fighting.  That people are dying because of my selfishness.

Tom and his crazy optimism is what keeps me from doing just that.

“Based on what the doctor said before he died, it should only be concerned with you,” Tom said.  “It’s *your* death.  So why is it swallowing up other people?”

“Proximity-” I began, but Tom quickly cut me off.

“Yeah, but was the doctor’s death swallowing up bystanders?  Yours was so much bigger than his, remember?  That’s what he said.  So I think not.  I think this year we need to find out why your death is taking other people.”

I laughed harshly.  I said something sarcastic, I think, about how sure we’ll just stroll up and ask it, I’m not entirely sure.  I was just trying to mask the pounding of my heart and how my mouth went dry at the thought of doing anything other than running and running and running from that void.  Pulling someone out had worked but I was so scared.  So very scared.

“You’ve been inside the void before,” Susan said.  “When you first met me.”

“I try not to think about that,” I muttered.

“But I think that it’s important.  You were at the hospital.  The place where it all started.  You were inside, but it wasn’t pulling you in, and you were able to walk out.”

“No, it tried to drag me back in,” I said uncomfortably.  I really didn’t like thinking about that incident.  I don’t like thinking about any of this, if I’m being perfectly honest.

“Yeah, at the border.  You didn’t like… insta-die.  It kind of makes me wonder if it was the proximity to the hospital.  Like stretching a rubber band - the further you get, the stronger the pull is.”

“So do you think it’ll be easier to escape closer to the hospital?”

I was skeptical, but intrigued.  As it turned out, no, that wasn’t the idea.  Tom had an entirely different plan altogether.

“I think,” Tom said, “we should use the hospital to get a good look around inside the void.”

Our strategy meeting broke up shortly after that because I had a panic attack.  Normally I’d say I had a sorta-panic attack or a quasi-panic attack but both Tom and Susan are nurses and have seen them before and both agreed: I had a panic attack.  Susan also threw around the word “trauma” a few times but we’re going to worry about that when this is all over.

Despite the rocky start, they had all year to convince me.  Though perhaps ‘convince’ isn’t the right word.  It wasn’t like they were trying to coerce me into doing something I didn’t want to.  More like they were presenting a couple different options on how to get through my birthday this year and one of them was a bit more risky than the others.

What finally convinced me though was the other people we saved this year.  Yes.  Plural.

The surprise deaths in the hospital happened at midnight, coinciding with mine.  Maybe, Tom suggested, if I hung around the area the deaths occurred in during that time of night, I could reverse them.  I could pull them out just as the doctor had pulled me out.

I agreed.

We have a twelve minute window.  There’s a coffee shop nearby that’s open until two in the morning and I wait there for their call.  The vast majority of the time, there’s nothing, and twelve minutes after midnight I leave and go home.  But three times this year… three times they’ve called and I’ve sprinted to the hospital.

The first time it was a grandparent, visiting their daughter who had given birth just a few hours prior to midnight.  They were in the hallway.  The team that had responded to try to resuscitate were about to give up.  Tom, standing nearby with his cellphone, was watching me as I approached.  His face was pale and his eyes blazed with determination.  I looked past him, at the inky darkness that yawned just a few yards away, and at the old man that was halfway inside, clawing at the linoleum in a desperate attempt to escape, to drag himself back to his body that lay all too far away from him.

My breath caught in my throat.  That old familiar terror flooded my nose and mouth, a sour taste, and my muscles twitched, ready to turn and run.  To run and run and run because that was all I could do, I was so helpless and no matter how much I ran someday it wouldn’t be enough-

There was a touch on the back of my wrist.

“Go,” Tom breathed.  “*Go.*”

Not to run.  But to go save him.

With shaking legs and a trembling heart, I forced myself to step forward.  One.  Two.  I felt the void pulling at me, like the wind of a storm, drawing me toward it.  The sounds of the hospital, the voice of someone pronouncing the time of death all faded away.  No one noticed me.  It was like I wasn’t there, half a ghost already, floating past them as I confronted my death.

I knelt.  And with trembling hands, I grabbed hold of the old man, and I pulled him back.  I pulled him free and he dissolved and his body gave a gasp, people started yelling, and I slipped away in the commotion as he returned to the life he should never have lost in the first place.

There were two more like this.

And that brings me to tonight.

I want to *live*.  Not just survive.  I have few friends and no family of my own because I’d never allowed myself to commit to anything, knowing that in less than a year it could be gone.  *I’d* be gone.  And it just wasn’t right to make those long-term plans that everyone else got to make, because one day I’d falter and fall and death would swallow me up.  Younger me thought it wouldn’t be fair to make too many people grieve.  Now I know that if my death catches me, it’ll be like I died in that hospital room so many years ago.  I’m not sure which is worse for those left behind - that they are left with my absence, or that they are left with a life rewritten to account for me never having been in it.

Regardless, I am tired of being afraid to plan ahead.  I want to live like I’d have two years, three, maybe even ten after that.  When we saved those three people this year, it was hope dangled in front of me and I snatched at it, finally admitting to myself that I was desperate to actually have a life worth living.

Maybe I didn’t have to run.  Maybe we could figure out why this was happening and reverse it.

Tonight there won’t be running.  I’m going into the void.  Tom and Susan got me close to the room they think I was born in.  When the void opens, I’ll see what’s there.  And then, like Theseus escaping the labyrinth, I’ll follow the rope tied to a climbing harness I’m wearing back to them.

The best part of the plan (according to Tom) is that if I don’t emerge from the edge of the void in time, they’ll just start pulling on the rope.  Considering I escaped via a stairwell last time, I think that sounds like a great way to break my leg, but hey, at least I’ll already be in the hospital, right?

So yeah.  That’s the plan.  I’m hiding out in one of the rooms.  I can barely breath I’m so nervous.  But maybe tonight we’ll find out why this is happening.  I’m going to shut the laptop now and brace myself for the void’s arrival.  I’ll tell you what happened when it’s over… and if I don’t make it… Susan will update you all in my stead.

Wish me luck… and wish me a happy birthday.

Okay I’m going to update REAL FAST here and then Tom and Susan and I are going for celebratory drinks.  Susan knows of a Tiki bar, she says.  That sounds great to me.  *Everything* sounds great right now.  I’m alive.

When midnight rolled around, the void opened up all around me.  The world dissolved into darkness and although I could feel the floor beneath me, it felt like I was suspended in nothing, an open, endless expanse with not even stars to relieve the darkness.  It felt like I was falling.  My chest seized up with fear and I had to shut my eyes.  I took a few breaths to steady myself, like Susan had taught me, and then I stood up.  I shuffled forward, hands outstretched, and I found a wall.  I followed it until I found a door.  And then I forced myself to open my eyes, to see the utter nothingness all around me, and I stepped out into the hallway.

None of us thought we’d find the room I was born in.  This wing of the hospital had been rennovated multiple times by now and even though we looked, we just couldn’t find any kind of layout from around when I was born.  I kept one hand on the wall and walked along it, my fingers trailing over door after door, and nothing changed.  I had a watch on my arm but even when I tapped it, I couldn’t see the lighted face of it to know how much longer I had in the void.  My heart was pounding painfully fast in my chest.  I was starting to panic, I knew I was panicking, but it felt like there was nothing I could do to stop it. My thoughts ran wild - this was stupid - I shouldn’t had listened to Tom - I’d gotten myself killed for nothing-

I turned around.  I went the other direction.  Lost in the dark as I was, without a sense of time or distance, I’m not sure how far I walked.  I shuffled along, painfully slow, knowing that I was making very poor progress but it was like my limbs were half-frozen.  All these years running and now I was too scared to even move.  I wanted to laugh and just as that hysteria that I’d been running from my whole life threatened to break free, something made me pause.  There was a touch against my face, like the stirring of air.  And I stopped, my hand against a wall, and I felt something brush against me again.  Cold as ice.  Steady.  Rhythmic.  Like the pulse of blood.

I knelt and with a piece of chalk I’d brought for this exact purpose, I marked the floor.  Susan’s idea.

There was a tug on the rope tied to my harness.  I’d taken too long.  It was time to go.  My friends were pulling me back, before the void closed.  I turned and gripped the rope with both hands, letting it pull me forward.  I stumbled, moving slowly, and the pulling grew more insistent.  They were practically dragging me along, but I couldn’t see - I didn’t know what was ahead of me - but we were running out of time -

I stumbled into a run, my hands out in front of me, choking and crying on my fear and I ran, just as I’ve run for so many years, except this time I was running blindly, pulled along by the desperation of my friends, reeling me in and drawing me out of the void.

The only reason I didn’t fall down the stairs was because that was where I reached the border of the void.  I emerged from it, my arms and head shoving out into the flickering incandescence of the stairway, and Tom and Susan release the rope and seized my hands instead.  

And all around me were people, clawing, grasping. The hands of the people trapped inside were grabbing my arms and shoulders, their touch was cold as ice, and around my wrist were Tom and Susan’s hands and I felt the heat of their grip, so hot it felt like my skin was burning.  I heard the roar of the void in my ears like an endless wave in the ocean, and underneath that I heard the frantic yelling of my friends - to pull - to pull me back.  And I drifted there, like time slowed, because there wasn’t much I could do to save myself except push forward, strain against those grasping hands like a dog on a leash, and I could only wait to see if I lived or died.  

That was when I noticed something.  The hands.  The hands that I’d fought against for years and years, ever since I was old enough to realize that I needed to fight, to escape them, that I’d die if I didn’t.

They weren’t pulling me in.  They were trying to pull themselves *out*.

I felt it in the way they clawed at my arms.  The hands sought to stretch further towards the light, towards *life*, inching their way forward using my body as purchase.  And I felt some of them slip, give, sliding backward against a current that tugged at my skin and my hair, that roared at me to join it in oblivion.

Death’s time was growing short, so it was coming for me.  It wouldn’t let me escape.  It wouldn’t let *any* of us escape.

I saw it.  At the very back.  Black on black, darkness within darkness, but I still *saw* it.  A maw, a throat, waiting to swallow up those that couldn’t fight the current any longer.

This void wasn’t death.  It was the prelude.  An in-between space.  *That* was death.  That was what we *all* were running from.

And still drifting in those few seconds of time where I didn’t know if I would live or die and there was a strange tranquility to it all, like I couldn’t feel the pounding of my own heart of taste the bitter stench of fear in my nose and mouth, I stretched out my hands and someone grabbed them.  I clamped down on their wrists, they did the same to mine, and we remained locked together like that when Tom finally got his feet underneath him and they *pulled,* all of them, and we all tumbled backwards out of the void.

I saw it close.  Like a curtain descending.  But the edges were tattered, and the people inside fell away, scattering, leaving behind only that presence that trashed and struggled but it did not disappear.  It remained.  I felt it, even as I was losing my footing and falling, the whisper of that current.  Like it was just on the other side of a sheet of glass.

Then we all landed in a heap of bodies and limbs at the base of the stairs.  The person I’d pulled out was a woman, younger than me, and she looked around wildly and then began sobbing uncontrollably.  Susan gathered her up and we all ushered her outside.

“I’ll take her… somewhere,” Susan said, after managing to bundle the nearly-hysterical woman into her car.  “Figure out where she needs to go and we’ll get her there.  I guess… reality rewrote itself last year for the person we pulled out, right?  Hopefully it’ll do the same here.”

She drove off, leaving Tom there to take me home, because we all agreed that I was going to be enough of a nervous wreck that I shouldn’t be driving.

“Do you still want to get tiki drinks?” he asked.

“I marked a spot in chalk,” I said.  “We need to make sure we know where it is before it gets cleaned up.”

He volunteered to go find out.  I could wait in the car, he said, and catch my breath.  Sit, wait for my heart to stop pounding, and update you all on what happened.

And there’s one more thing I want to say.  Something I’m going to share with Tom and Susan as well.  The void.  The vortex.  And that current that followed me to its edge, that sought to drag us all into its maw.  Something that dwells inside but isn’t the entirety of the void.

I think it’s wedged open.  I was pulled out but I don’t think that in-between space closed behind me. I think its been sitting open this entire time and people are falling in and some of them are getting claimed by the death roaming inside, seeking to swallow up anyone that isn’t fast enough to escape.  And once a year, in those twelve minutes, it stretches out in an attempt to grab me and drag me back.  Like that rubber band in Susan’s analogy, except it won’t break, it can’t be released, and it just stretches and stretches and stretches.

(Bottles)(Decant)","Timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/zGifaDB

Whats up my friends,

I have a nice bundle package (18) of Middle Eastern Dupes, Twists and some OGs. I purchased a slew of them Brand New to test them against some of the real OGs. A lot of redundancy so these are first to go. Ill have many more coming soon after testing as they are all (60) going. No boxes!

Ive got crushing OCD so throw me a lifeline on this one. 🤣

Macerate 12 weeks: Each one had precisely 10 sprays, flipped upside down and sprayed tube dry, then stored upright in a pitch black 67 degree temperature/humidity controlled environment for 12 weeks. At each 4 week interval, I would gently rotate the juice on each and then store away. 

At 12 weeks I sprayed each 2-3 more times to test the final product. Its very bizarre how they can change, some drastically, over that time. 🤔 

All bottles are 99%+

If you are wanting to try these out, let me know what you have! Im pretty open to offers of Designer/Niche (New or Partial). I do have.....a lot🙃, so worst I can say is, no thank you🤜🏼🤛🏼. 

Anyways.... here we go with the short story long.

Feel Free to shoot your shot! 🫡

❗️Designer/Niche bottles only please, not more dupes❗️

I know breville is popular as well but I wanted something with a 58mm portafilter so that way in the future I can upgrade machines (as I also hope this will turn into a long term hobby). I’ve seen quite a few people talk about the steam wand loosing pressure and heat for the gaggia but I love how it looks.

[Last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pld14q/straw_poll_saturday_for_december_13_2025_sans/) we had 27 voters for the 43nd Straw Poll Saturday, down 64% from 74 [the previous week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pfg9b4/straw_poll_saturday_for_december_6_2025_schedule/).

**Putting Out The Call**: If you have any suggestions on future straw poll topics, please drop them in the comments.  **I will soon run out of topics without your help.**

Based on the results of last week's poll, we are going to be doing a bracket for NA beer.  The turn out of 27 voters bodes ill for this endeavour, but we will do it anyway!

## THE ULTIMATE NA BEER CHAMPIONSHIP IS HERE!

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your favorite zero-proof beverage and settle in, because we're about to witness the most epic non-alcoholic beer showdown in r/stopdrinking history! After months of sparkling water supremacy battles, it's time to crown the ultimate NA BEER CHAMPION!

**THIRTY-TWO COMPETITORS. ONE BRACKET. GLORY ETERNAL.**

This isn't just any tournament, folks. This is a bracket packed with the absolute TITANS of the alcohol-free brewing world. We've got craft brewery powerhouses, European brewing legends, and scrappy American upstarts all competing for ultimate supremacy. Let me break down what you need to know about this STACKED field!

## The Athletic Brewing Dynasty

**THE ATHLETIC BREWING EMPIRE IS COMING IN HOT!** This Connecticut-based craft brewery has brought SIX entries to the tournament, and they're not here to play nice. Leading the charge is **Athletic Run Wild IPA** - the most decorated non-alcoholic beer in the WORLD with 30+ awards. This hop bomb delivers pine and citrus notes with 35 IBUs of crisp bitterness that'll make you forget you're drinking NA. Then we've got **Free Wave Hazy IPA** bringing those juicy, tropical vibes, **Upside Dawn Golden** with its crushable sessionability, and **Atlética** representing the light lager game. Don't sleep on **Wit's Peak** (their Belgian witbier play) or **All Out Extra Dark** (because who says NA can't go stout?). Athletic is basically treating this bracket like their personal showcase, and honestly, they've earned that swagger.

## The European Brewing Aristocracy

**CENTURIES OF BREWING TRADITION ENTER THE ARENA!** The Germans are bringing SERIOUS pedigree with **Weihenstephaner Alkoholfrei** - brewed using techniques from the World Famous Weihenstephan Brewing University (yes, that's a real thing). This golden hefeweizen removes alcohol through falling film evaporation developed with the Technical University of Munich, resulting in tangy, honey-clove perfection at just 15 calories. **Erdinger Alkoholfrei** represents more German wheat beer excellence, while **Clausthaler Original** and **Bitburger Drive** are bringing that classic German pilsner game.

Then there's the ICON - **Guinness 0.0** - arguably the most important entry in this entire bracket. This nitro-widget-powered stout nails the exact flavor, body, and silky texture of regular Guinness with nutty, chocolatey, coffee notes. If Guinness can make a 0.0% version this good, the entire industry has to step up their game.

## The Craft Brewery Wildcards

**THE AMERICAN CRAFT SCENE IS READY FOR WAR!** **BrewDog** brought THREE fighters to this tournament: **Punk AF** (their flagship IPA with tropical fruit and pine notes), **Hazy AF** (because hazy IPAs run the world right now), and **Elvis AF** (their grapefruit IPA wildcard). These Scottish rebels are here to prove that attitude matters.

**Lagunitas IPNA** is the West Coast IPA representative with Citra, Mosaic, and Columbus hops delivering ""the most advanced hop character"" in the NA game. **Brooklyn Special Effects IPA** represents East Coast brewing pride, while **Deschutes** brought both **NA Fresh Squeeze IPA** AND **NA Black Butte Porter** - because Oregon doesn't half-step on anything.

**Sierra Nevada Trail Pass Hazy IPA** is the California craft legend's entry into the NA space, while **Go Brewing Disarm Hazy IPA** is the scrappy underdog that could surprise everyone.

## The Mass Market Heavyweights

**BIG BEER IS IN THE HOUSE!** **Heineken 0.0** and **Asahi Super Dry 0.0%** are bringing international lager dominance. **Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0%** represents Italian summer vibes. **Sam Adams Just the Haze** proves Boston's original craft brewery can hang in the NA hazy IPA space.

And then there are the domestic light beer entries - **Bud Lite Zero** and **Michelob ULTRA Zero** - representing the ""I just want something familiar"" demographic. Will brand recognition carry them, or will craft quality crush them? THAT'S WHAT TOURNAMENTS ARE FOR!

## The Dark Horse Specialists

Don't overlook the specialists! **WellBeing Heavenly Body Golden Wheat** is an independent NA-only brewery bringing their A-game. **Oskar Blues Designated Dale's NA Pils** takes their famous Dale's Pale Ale and strips the alcohol while keeping the flavor.

**Best Day NA IPA** is the California lifestyle brand that's built their entire identity around premium alcohol-free IPAs. They're not just competing - they're trying to prove their entire business model.

## The Wild Card Entry

And then there's the chaos agent: **""I don't drink NA beer""** - the write-in option for anyone who thinks this entire bracket is nonsense. Will the protest vote shock the world? PROBABLY NOT, BUT IT'S THERE IF YOU NEED IT!

## What's At Stake

This bracket will answer the ultimate questions:

- Can craft breweries beat international megabrands?
- Will IPA dominance translate to the NA space, or will classic styles reign supreme?
- Is Athletic Brewing actually unstoppable, or can the European legends show them how it's done?
- Does hop character matter more than brand recognition?
- Will anyone actually vote for Bud Lite Zero?

**THE TOURNAMENT STARTS NOW!**

Voting is open and will close sometime Thursday (timezone? what timezone? we're all living in bracket time now, baby!).

Get in there and make your voice heard! This is YOUR chance to crown the ultimate NA beer champion of 2025 (spilling into 2026)!

Hey, I’m Taka — a taxi driver in Osaka!

Today’s Osaka feels crazy warm.
It’s December and almost 20°C… Santa might be visiting kids in a T-shirt this year😂

Just to be clear, I use Chappie(ChatGPT) to help write my posts.
Thank you for all the reactions to yesterday’s post — the support, the agreement, and the criticism.
To be honest, what I fear most is indifference, so I appreciate everyone who spoke up, even when the criticism was directed at me or the Japanese government.
Indifference doesn’t change anything.

From today’s Osaka, it’s hard to imagine, but years ago the city had serious problems with illegal parking and illegal dumping.
Buses couldn’t even get through, and horns were constantly blaring.
At that time, many people raised their voices and expressed frustration toward the government, and because of that, things gradually improved.
That’s why I believe this issue can also be solved in the long run.
Feel free to keep sharing both positive and negative opinions.

I can’t reply to every comment or DM, but I do read them all.
They really motivate me — thank you.
As for videos, I’m planning to post a short one sometime soon.
And thanks to anyone who gave an award!
If you come to Japan, say hi — I’ll treat you to a canned coffee.

Hi everyone,
I’m posting to see if anyone has experienced something similar, because the timing of this is really throwing me off.

About 2+ weeks ago, I had dental work done (root canal + multiple numbing shots, one with epinephrine). Shortly after that, I started having significant stomach and reflux symptoms that I’ve never had this intensely before.

Here’s what’s been happening:
	•	Burning acid/reflux coming up, sometimes sour/watery regurgitation/vomiting 
	•	Chest pain/tightness that comes and goes
	•	Trapped, painful burps at times, and other times loose sour burps/ I felt like I lost ability to burp to relieve myself
	•	Extreme bloating and pressure under the sternum
	•	Feeling very full after small amounts of food
	•	Some days are much worse than others
	•	Symptoms fluctuate and seem worse with gas/pressure
	•	Posture (sitting upright, leaning forward) sometimes helps

Before this, I only had occasional reflux (like too much coffee or fried food), easily managed with a Tums once in a while. I was not on daily PPIs.

Before and after symptoms started, I:
	•	Took NSAIDs briefly for dental pain
	•	Took antibiotics
	•	Tried a PPI for about a week, then stopped
	•	Noticed symptoms worsened after a second dental numbing shot, even though I was starting to feel better before that, PPI made this worse so I stopped after a week of that

My theory (not medical advice, just wondering if others experienced this):
	•	Dental work → swallowing a lot of air + stress
	•	Epinephrine in numbing shots → nervous system / vagus nerve activation
	•	NSAIDs + antibiotics → stomach lining irritation
	•	Short PPI use + stopping → acid sensitivity
	•	All of that together → stomach inflammation + gas + LES misfiring

It feels less like “classic GERD” and more like a post-trigger flare that hasn’t calmed down yet.

TMI doesn’t matter what I eat, even drinking water I regurgitate and bloat and fill with air. Also my poops and all the bottom stuff are all normal! 

I’m curious:
	•	Has anyone had GI or reflux symptoms start after dental work?
	•	Did it take weeks to calm down?
	•	Did it eventually return to baseline?
	•	Anything that helped besides PPIs?

3. your trash can is broken. 

reality: when you step on it the lid dont open, you have manually open the trash cans lid. I told him there’s a hook to the lid if he puts the hook back on that will fix the issue. he never responded back. 

 also I don’t know how a trash can can be broken if you can still use it??

4. there is no coffee k-cups for keuirg. 

reality: I do not have to provide coffee. I do it to be nice, but the last guest must if used all of it. I offered to door dash some he said no. 

5. there was 2 pieces of tissue in the trashcan. 

reality: when I change toilet paper roll I tear off the first piece so it can easily be used. I must’ve put in trashcan. I apologized for this, next time I will flush 1 piece of tissue. i can see if it was full of trash, or nasty trash. but 1 piece of toilet paper? really? I apologized for this. 

6. the fire pit doesnt work: 

reality: i told guest you have to turn on the gas tank first by turning the knob on propane tank, or else it won’t work. then you can press ignition button. directions are in the house manual. he never responded back. 

7. the body wash is nearly empty.

I’m 38, living in Chandigarh, and like many people these days, I never expected something meaningful or even memorable,to begin on Reddit.

It started casually, a few messages exchanged with a woman who was 32, confident, witty, and refreshingly honest. What surprised me most was her excitement. There was no hesitation, no games,just a shared curiosity that slowly turned into anticipation. We decided to meet for coffee, keeping it simple, daylight, no pressure.

That afternoon in Chandigarh felt different. When she walked into the café, I recognized her instantly. She had an effortless charm,soft eyes that held curiosity, a warm smile that came easily, and a presence that made the room feel quieter. She was beautifully put together, not in an exaggerated way, but naturally, graceful posture, a well-defined figure, and the kind of confidence that doesn’t need to announce itself. She laughed often, and when she did, it felt genuine.

Our coffee turned into hours of conversation. We spoke about life, randomness, missed chances, and the strange way two strangers can feel familiar within minutes. There was chemistry, unmistakable but calm, like we both knew something was unfolding without needing to rush it.

Later that night, she surprised me again, this time with an invitation. Simple, direct, and honest. She asked me to join her at a hotel in the city. No drama, no expectations spoken aloud, just mutual trust and excitement.

That night was beautiful in a way that’s hard to explain without overexplaining. It wasn’t about excess,it was about connection. The ease between us, the shared laughter, the quiet moments, and the warmth of being present with someone who genuinely wanted to be there. Time slowed down. The city outside faded away, leaving just two people enjoying a moment that felt rare and real.

On any given Sunday, Americans flock to their couches to watch hours of football on TV. Wall Street trading floors are closed, but the American pastime has become prime time for upstart financial platforms known as prediction markets. This past weekend, National Football League fans placed more than $200 million worth of NFL trades through Kalshi, the leading prediction market in the U.S. The financial contracts, like sports bets, pay out depending on the outcome of each game.

Many of those trades are powered by Robinhood Markets’ popular stock trading platform, meaning that viewers can use their NFL profits to buy shares of Nvidia, Nike, or Netflix —all from one app.

Robinhood, which was home to the meme-stock revolution, has gradually brought prediction markets onto its platform over the past year and added Kalshi’s NFL contracts for the current season. It sees event contracts, which allow clients to place money on Yes/No predictions about coming events, as a democratizing force in the world of finance.

“Adding pro and college football to our prediction markets hub is a no-brainer for us as we aim to make Robinhood a one-stop shop for all your investing and trading needs,” Robinhood said in a blog post announcing the Kalshi-NFL partnership.

But that one-stop shop is raising uncomfortable questions across the world of wealth management: If the same app allows the same trader to place money on the outcome of sports events and corporate earnings growth, what’s the difference between gambling and investing?

“The lines of investing and gambling are being blurred like never before,” says James Martielli, head of investment product for Vanguard’s Personal Investor business.

And this week, those lines blurred even more, with Robinhood announcing sports trades linked to a series of related events. One possibility: The San Francisco 49ers will win on Sunday, Christian McCaffrey will rush for more than 100 yards, and the total score will be more than 50.

The latest trades, which resemble parlay bets in traditional gambling, pay out only if each event within the combination resolves correctly. Robinhood says the new combos give customers “another way to turn their nuanced sports knowledge into an investing opportunity.”

Incumbents like Vanguard, known for its buy-and-hold approach to investing, and Charles Schwab , which itself upended the world of retail investing in the 1970s with discounted stock trades, have steered clear of prediction markets.

“I just don’t want young people in our country to think gambling on the Monday Night Football game is the same as investing in stocks and bonds,” Rick Wurster, Schwab’s recently installed CEO, told a room of 5,000 financial advisors in November.

“The challenge I see with this is that investing over the long run pays off,” he said. “And you have all dramatically enhanced the financial lives of your clients by helping them identify how to invest and what to invest in.”

Wurster’s defense highlights the stakes of the debate. It isn’t just incumbent versus start-up or young versus old. The rise of prediction markets is testing the meaning of an investment.

“Prediction markets, especially sports outcome contracts, are primarily gambling and entertainment products and are not aligned with Vanguard’s mission to give investors the best chance for investment success,” says a Vanguard spokeswoman.

No brokerage firm has embraced prediction markets more fully than Robinhood, which has catered to a younger audience since it was founded in 2013. It offers a range of topics to trade on, but sports and elections are the most popular. The company says its prediction markets are now generating $100 million in annualized revenue with 11 billion contracts trading hands since the end of last year.

Prediction markets allow investors to wager on the outcome of seemingly any event you can think of—from who will win an election to whether the CEO of Costco Wholesale will say the words “dividend” or “hot dog” on its next earnings call. And, of course, sports. On Sunday, Dec. 7, prediction market Kalshi saw $329 million traded on its platform, according to analytics firm Dune.

“Prediction markets are really on fire,” said Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev during the company’s third-quarter earnings call, adding that he loves being an early mover with regard to this “new asset class.”

But for now, the new asset class looks mostly like a sportsbook. Of those Dec. 7 Kalshi transactions, 97%, or $318 million, were traded on sports.

Sensing a threat to the sportsbook business, DraftKings launched its own prediction market platform on Friday, which will enable the company to operate in states where sports gambling is otherwise banned. FanDuel says its prediction market is coming soon.

\*\*Playing the Odds\*\*

The event contracts sold on prediction markets are built around yes/no questions. “Will the Cowboys win Sunday’s game?” If the odds are 70% in the Cowboys favor, the “yes” side of the contract costs 70 cents, while the “no” side would cost 30 cents. At the conclusion of the event, the correct trade pays out the full $1.

While a sportsbook is effectively the counterparty for any sports bet, prediction market platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket serve as a facilitator. Put another way, there is no “house.” Their exchanges connect customers on each side of a given contract and take a transactional fee, usually a penny per contract. Robinhood takes an additional penny for contracts traded on its site.

Robinhood’s Tenev has said that prediction markets give investors the ability to price any event and to hedge against risk.

A landlord worried about New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s pledge to freeze rent hikes could have theoretically hedged against potentially lost rental income by buying event contracts related to the recent mayoral election.

Those financial hedges remain mostly a curiosity for now. This past month, while options markets were abuzz with traders trying to find an arbitrage opportunity in shares of Warner Bros. Discovery amid a bidding war for the company, prediction markets were notably quiet. After six days of trading, one event—“Who will successfully take over Warner Brothers?”—had $96,000 worth of bets. “Pro basketball champion?” by comparison, had more than $11 million.

Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers Group , may be prediction markets’ biggest bull among the old guard. His firm, which traces its roots to 1977, has its own prediction market, ForecastTrader, which is focused on economic and climate indicators. It doesn’t offer sports-related contracts.

“In my mind, prediction markets will be the biggest space for investors in the coming years,” says Peterffy, “I think it will far exceed the popularity of even the stock market. It will eventually get to the point where people get up in the morning and any questions they have about that day, that year, or the coming decade, they can go get the consensus from the prediction markets.”

Global volume on prediction markets reached $13 billion in November, according to Dune, up from less than $100 million in April 2024.

That growth is spurring keen interest from other parts of Wall Street, as well. Kalshi recently raised $1 billion from big name venture-capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz at an $11 billion valuation.

In October, Polymarket got a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, valuing the prediction platform at $8 billion.

Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, recently told investors that half of the company’s 10,000 institutional clients could be buyers of data from Polymarket. “Hedge funds have the Polymarket app up, and traders are using it for hot news,” Sprecher said. “We think for our legacy business of oil and gas and cocoa and coffee and all kinds of basic commodities—even interest rates—that people are going to want to see: OK there’s something hot here, and I better pay attention to it.”

\*\*Bookie or Broker\*\*

While Wall Street titans seek to recruit customers with prediction markets, some in the industry are going the other way.

In November, New York–based online brokerage Public ran a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal emphasizing its mission: “Wealth is not won in a bet. If you’re looking for a broker that’s not also your bookie, we invite you to try Public.”

Leif Abraham, co-founder and co-CEO of Public, tells Barron’s that the firm’s ad campaign is intended to help attract customers who are serious about investing and creating long-term wealth.

“Event contracts may have a place, and sports contracts can be fun, but that place shouldn’t be your investing account,” Abraham says. “We want people to be able to trust us with their finances and perhaps one day their financial inheritance.”

He says his firm could one day offer event contracts related to financial matters but not sports—even if it means sacrificing revenue. “In the brokerage space, I think there is always a tension between short-term revenue and a long-term relationship with a customer.”

Financial advisors, who manage much of the country’s wealth, also see a threat from betting’s encroachment. “We’re not in favor of sports and investing being side-by-side,” says Sean Hanlon, co-founder and chief investment officer of VestGen Investment Management, a wealth manager that has $7 billion in assets under management.

For now, it’s the bookies that are taking the biggest hit from prediction markets’ rise. Shares of DraftKings and FanDuel-parent Flutter Entertainment are down 8% and 16%, respectively, this year as their moat dries up and sports bettors are drawn to the simplicity of prediction markets.

Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley has estimated that as much as $8 billion in revenue could flow to prediction markets if they take 20% of market share from sportsbooks. Moley thinks prediction markets can become more than just sports, and that, as they do more, brokerage firms may want to offer access to investors. But right now, growth is being driven by sports. “There’s no doubt that’s the case,” Moley says.

\*\*Investing Redefined\*\*

The term invest, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission is “to engage in any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit.” The commission doesn’t include gambling in its glossary, but certainly the same words could apply.

Maybe it’s just a vibe, or as Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once wrote about obscenity: “I know it when I see it.”

Some market experts distinguish investing from gambling by the time horizon at work. “The closer you are to win everything, lose everything, in some kind of short time frame, the closer you are to gambling,” says Vanguard’s Martielli.

Kalshi tells Barron’s that prediction markets’ “structure, utility, and business model make them wholly different from gambling, while their broad cultural appeal differentiates them from standard financial markets.”

Polymarket didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Robinhood and Tenev see prediction markets as a natural evolution in finance.

“Prediction markets are often dismissed as ‘gambling’—just as cars were once dismissed as ‘horseless carriages,’ ” the Robinhood CEO wrote in a post on X. “Like any new innovation, they don’t fit neatly into any one category.”

Casinos and gambling oversight were once the sole domain of the states, while financial markets are generally regulated by the federal government, notably the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

But now those regulatory distinctions are collapsing, courtesy of prediction markets. The CFTC, which regulates event contracts, approved Kalshi’s move into political and sports betting markets. The next battle revolves around whether courts determine sports event contracts to be investing or gambling.

Thus far, the CFTC isn’t taking a stand. “I would look to what the courts say,” said Michael Selig, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the CFTC, at his recent confirmation hearing.

\*\*Drawing Lines\*\*

Webull, a relatively new entrant to the world of online stock trading, began offering financial-related event contracts in 2024 and expanded to sports in September.

“We saw some client activity moving to other platforms to get access to these products,” says Webull’s U.S. CEO Anthony Denier. The company offers contracts for NFL, college football, National Basketball Association, Nascar, and F1 events.

More than 30 million event contracts were traded in October on Webull’s platform. That’s nearly twice the volume of September. Denier says November saw similar growth.

He doesn’t see much difference between trading sports event contracts and other kinds of futures or options products. “When you are offering a futures product, you can be talking about where the price of gold will be trading, or soybeans or oil,” he says. “This is just a contract for another specific event.”

Chris Grove, partner emeritus at gambling industry market research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, says gambling versus investing is an age-old debate. “The reality is we’ve drawn a line somewhere and said things on this side of the line are capital-G Gambling.”

Webull’s line is drawn at pop culture. It’s skipping Kalshi trades like, “Who will win Survivor season 49?” or “Will Trump attend another UFC event this year?”

“There needs to be enough market participation,” Denier says. “If you go too far down the tail, you can get contracts that don’t really trade, and customers can be frustrated.”

After his cautionary speech to financial advisors in Denver, Schwab’s Wurster remains pragmatic about the future of prediction markets.

“I prefer we don’t get into sports gambling,” he says. “The reality we face is that if our competitors are making so much money in sports gambling that it gives them an edge to invest in brokerage—that’s something we have to keep an eye on.”
