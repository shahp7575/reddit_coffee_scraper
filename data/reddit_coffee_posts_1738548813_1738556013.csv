I thought it would be fun to make a prison hooch out of some of this stuff. I was wondering what items you might use to make hooch and what you would avoid. Let me know what you think.

1iggh5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1iggh5u/had_a_nice_interaction_at_a_coffee_shop_today/,Had a nice interaction at a coffee shop today!,"I went to a new branch of a great coffee shop that opened recently. I had gone to the old branch before a while ago and the guy was super nice and we talked about espresso things and James Hoffmann (coffee Youtuber), and he made me the best espresso I had ever had. So I was really excited to check the new one out.

It didn't disappoint! I was happy to see the same owner guy was there! The place had a great vibe. They had a record player going and they used a lever machine for the espresso, which I don't think I've ever seen in a commercial shop (for workflow reasons). I ordered my espresso and chatted about stuff while he made it. After I finished it we talked some more about coffee things, then he showed me this funky natural Colombian coffee he had and offered to make me a pour-over with it. How could I refuse? He didn't even charge me for it! Also I tried to put a custom tip amount on the card reader but I just typed ""2"" and after I hit confirm I saw it was only 2 cents! 😂 Oops. I also didn't have any cash on hand. I said sorry and he was like nah don't worry about it. It was pretty damn good though, and about as strange as I expected. One of the tasting notes on the bag was ""Cherry Cola"" and I kinda picked up a bit of that. Oh, and I also picked up a new bag of Onyx coffee from Ethiopia (one of my favorite origins). I've heard a lot about Onyx but haven't tried it yet. There's a reason to get up tomorrow!

Overall a great experience. My anxiety wasn't too bad and I think I did a decent job of restraining myself from infodumping or rambling (like I'm doing here lol) and it's nice to talk to a fellow coffee nerd. There's not really any other specialty coffee shops in town. I'll have to return next weekend when I'm not in as much of a rush!    Thanks for reading, feels good to put this down somewhere and vent(positive venting I guess?). If there's any other specialty coffee enthusiasts here I hope you found it interesting, and if you want to discuss coffee things please do, in the comments or DM.

TL:DR - had good coffee, and good conversation. Will do again!!

I am tired of people begging to be friends when I can't even fucking message them. If you are under 16 years old or over 20 and also plan on sending a message, (as kindly as I can mean) piss off. <3

Now, if you've passed that test, hi, my name is Uzi! I am a 17 year old transgender Canadian. I've been unsuccessfully trying to make friends. I screw around on Discord a lot, so Discord is probably a nice place to make some friends. I've been trying to see if I can find anyone that I can relate to, if you're Jewish, Trans (MtF), Canadian, a doomer, a severe idiot, or musician, Awesome! Let me know.

About me? Here's some things I like:

\- MUSIC! I LOVE MUSIC. I fucking love Joy Division, it is peak doomer music. It got me into a bit of some Goth, Post-Punk, and Synth stuff. I enjoy Nirvana too, for the sake of staying 'dark', 'edgy' and whatnot. I do love Syd Matters, one of my greatest inspirations, Life Is Strange partially contributed into my love for them! Mentioning Pink Floyd and Evelyn Evelyn just to include them. I play guitar, I'm not great at it, but I enjoy playing. I sing too, I'm fairly good at it, and I love singing when I can.

\- I unfortunately game. I've wasted a lot of time gaming. I play games like Terraria, Garry's Mod, SCP:CB Multiplayer, Life Is Strange, and Roblox! (For Roblox games: Scorched Earth, Trenches: Beta, Centaura, Dead Ahead, Entrenched, and Desert War.) I own Minecraft, but an only play mostly older versions because of my horrid PC.

\- I write. I've written bad poetry, lyrics, I've tried worldbuilding, and I've done text-roleplay. (If you've read this far, keyword is ""Cold Coffee"". Someone told me that I have potential in writing, it's just that I haven't actually done anything big with it.  :c

\- I'm terminally online. I've spend so much time browsing 4Chan, Reddit, and Discord that my brain has been permanently fried. If I get too weird, autistic, or a little insulting, let me know and I'll try cutting it out.

\- Schedule: I'm more active during the evening-nighttime hours. I have classes, though I'm mostly free on the weekends.

There's still a lot more to me that I'm willing to share if you're still interested! DM me and we'll talk about moving things to Discord. Cya until then or something.",1,1738555497.0,discordfriends,0,1.0,False

# Silver Skate Festival

To anyone who's made it this far, you may have noticed a subtly consistent theme in this weeks post. And if only to confirm your hunches, you are absolutely correct, this is a week highlighted by festivals! Kicking off this coming weekend is Edmonton's longest running winter festival. Now on it's 35th consecutive year, this mostly FREE 10 day family-friendly festival features a plethora of different activities that are sure to put a broad smile on the face of every human in your home. Attendees can burn off some energy over broom ball, jam can curling, corn hole & ball hockey. Kids will love the ice slide & snow build zone, and everyone will like the figure skating demos, EFRS meet & greet & more. Those looking to explore their artistic side will get crafty making lanterns, checking out the snow & fire sculptures, the snow sculpting workshop, a heritage village & more! For those in above average shape, test your endurance in the (paid registration events of) winter triathlon (which features a skate, cross county ski & run at various lengths), ice duathlon (skating & running) or the frost buster 5k run. And while those are paid events, it's 100% FREE to cheer on your favourite athletes as they best their opponents and cross the finish line in style. 

# Try It Festival (Leduc)

With our cold winter climes here in Edmonton & the surrounding regions, it's easy to get into a work/sleep routine while unintentionally abstaining from all available fun activity. If you've found yourself caught up in such a situation, break the cycle by heading out to Wizard lake on Saturday morning/early afternoon for a party hosted by Leduc County in conjunction with the Wizard Lake Watershed Association. Once there, you'll find yourself situated amidst a host of fun winter activities to try, with good folks guiding each experience as you initiate yourself into them. Available try it activities include ice skating, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, curling, broom ball and ice fishing. In addition, attendees can also enjoy bonfires, maple taffy on snow, sleigh rides, face painting, live music, door prizes, and (while supplies last) hot dogs, hot chocolate & coffee! So if you're looking for something fun to break the winter blues (or even if you aren't), head that way to enjoy this completely FREE, fun, family friendly festival. 

# The International Festival of Winter Cinema

For longtime readers of my weekly rambling habit, you may recall at some point last summer, me saying something along the lines of ""if there are any more film festivals, surely I will eat my hat""! Well let me tell you, folks, I'm fresh out of hats & will soon be moving on to toques! Founded right here in Edmonton in 2017, the ten day International Festival of Winter Cinema is the worlds only completely FREE outdoor winter film festival (and for those who submitted entries, is a competitive, juried event). Presenting in partnership with the Silver Skate Festival, attendees will be able to bundle up & enjoy indie-produced, winter-focused cinematic masterpieces in the relative comfort of their greater backyard. Enjoy many films ranging in length from a couple minutes to an hour plus! Along with the films, there will also be an ongoing silent auction (with some seriously awesome prizes) taking place in the IFWC's heated tent, bonfires to warm up at and a low-cost concession for any movie-goers craving a snack. I'm seriously stoked for this one, personally. 

# Sweet Treats & Latte Festival

Speaking of upcoming festivals, here's a great one that many of you folks are certain to love. Beginning this coming Friday, head over to Edmonton's iconic Whyte Ave to participate in something that can only really be described as the quintessential YEG experience. Here's the gist. Attendees get 10 days to visit their favourite (participating) bakeries, cafes & restaurants & purchase certain menu items. These items will grant you stickers. Collect enough stickers & you'll be entered to win some epic prizes! It is a typically slow season for local operators & joining in on this local festival can really boost some spirits! When & where able, thank you for your support of local businesses  = ) 

# Canadian Birkie Ski Festival

Just a couple years back, around the year 1205/1206 or so, a great civil war broke out in Norway. The Baglers (a political party) had engaged in a power clash against the King of Norway & were hunting for the infant heir to the throne, Haakon Haakonssen. Two brave Norweigan Skiers found the lad first and bravely transported him & his mother north before making a perilous crossing of Norways northern mountains via ski and delivering the boy to Trondheim. The boy would grow to become a powerful king who united the country and ended 1000 years of civil wars. Only a few years after this, in 1930, Norwegian forester, poet & children's book author Haakon Lie would suggest an annual ski race to honour the rescue of this 18 month old child. Two years later, on January 10, 1932, a fledgling group of six guys met atop Mt Raufjellet and planned the very first Birkebeinerrennet, which would follow a 59km route through the a mountainous region in Northern Norway. 147 guys partook in this event (which happened that same year) and it was history in the making. 

Now, almost a century later, the Birkie Ski Race is an annual event held in several locations around the world, including the Canadian edition which is this coming weekend and guess what... you're invited! For enthusiasts of prairie sticking, grab your well waxed classic skis (no skate skis allowed) and get out to Cooking Lake/Blackfoot for the Edmonton Area's premier loppet. Course lengths include a family fun ski, a 7km, 13km, 31km, 55km lite & 55km with pack with entry prices varying by registered course length. 

For those not interested in skiing, there aren't a whole lot of activities available to partake in. But if nothing more, everyone is welcome to cheer on the racers, especially as they cross the finish line. 



Have a fantastic week, folks!

# Silver Skate Festival

To anyone who's made it this far, you may have noticed a subtly consistent theme in this weeks post. And if only to confirm your hunches, you are absolutely correct, this is a week highlighted by festivals! Kicking off this coming weekend is Edmonton's longest running winter festival. Now on it's 35th consecutive year, this mostly FREE 10 day family-friendly festival features a plethora of different activities that are sure to put a broad smile on the face of every human in your home. Attendees can burn off some energy over broom ball, jam can curling, corn hole & ball hockey. Kids will love the ice slide & snow build zone, and everyone will like the figure skating demos, EFRS meet & greet & more. Those looking to explore their artistic side will get crafty making lanterns, checking out the snow & fire sculptures, the snow sculpting workshop, a heritage village & more! For those in above average shape, test your endurance in the (paid registration events of) winter triathlon (which features a skate, cross county ski & run at various lengths), ice duathlon (skating & running) or the frost buster 5k run. And while those are paid events, it's 100% FREE to cheer on your favourite athletes as they best their opponents and cross the finish line in style. 

# Try It Festival (Leduc)

With our cold winter climes here in Edmonton & the surrounding regions, it's easy to get into a work/sleep routine while unintentionally abstaining from all available fun activity. If you've found yourself caught up in such a situation, break the cycle by heading out to Wizard lake on Saturday morning/early afternoon for a party hosted by Leduc County in conjunction with the Wizard Lake Watershed Association. Once there, you'll find yourself situated amidst a host of fun winter activities to try, with good folks guiding each experience as you initiate yourself into them. Available try it activities include ice skating, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, curling, broom ball and ice fishing. In addition, attendees can also enjoy bonfires, maple taffy on snow, sleigh rides, face painting, live music, door prizes, and (while supplies last) hot dogs, hot chocolate & coffee! So if you're looking for something fun to break the winter blues (or even if you aren't), head that way to enjoy this completely FREE, fun, family friendly festival. 

# The International Festival of Winter Cinema

For longtime readers of my weekly rambling habit, you may recall at some point last summer, me saying something along the lines of ""if there are any more film festivals, surely I will eat my hat""! Well let me tell you, folks, I'm fresh out of hats & will soon be moving on to toques! Founded right here in Edmonton in 2017, the ten day International Festival of Winter Cinema is the worlds only completely FREE outdoor winter film festival (and for those who submitted entries, is a competitive, juried event). Presenting in partnership with the Silver Skate Festival, attendees will be able to bundle up & enjoy indie-produced, winter-focused cinematic masterpieces in the relative comfort of their greater backyard. Enjoy many films ranging in length from a couple minutes to an hour plus! Along with the films, there will also be an ongoing silent auction (with some seriously awesome prizes) taking place in the IFWC's heated tent, bonfires to warm up at and a low-cost concession for any movie-goers craving a snack. I'm seriously stoked for this one, personally. 

# Sweet Treats & Latte Festival

Speaking of upcoming festivals, here's a great one that many of you folks are certain to love. Beginning this coming Friday, head over to Edmonton's iconic Whyte Ave to participate in something that can only really be described as the quintessential YEG experience. Here's the gist. Attendees get 10 days to visit their favourite (participating) bakeries, cafes & restaurants & purchase certain menu items. These items will grant you stickers. Collect enough stickers & you'll be entered to win some epic prizes! It is a typically slow season for local operators & joining in on this local festival can really boost some spirits! When & where able, thank you for your support of local businesses  = ) 

# Canadian Birkie Ski Festival

Just a couple years back, around the year 1205/1206 or so, a great civil war broke out in Norway. The Baglers (a political party) had engaged in a power clash against the King of Norway & were hunting for the infant heir to the throne, Haakon Haakonssen. Two brave Norweigan Skiers found the lad first and bravely transported him & his mother north before making a perilous crossing of Norways northern mountains via ski and delivering the boy to Trondheim. The boy would grow to become a powerful king who united the country and ended 1000 years of civil wars. Only a few years after this, in 1930, Norwegian forester, poet & children's book author Haakon Lie would suggest an annual ski race to honour the rescue of this 18 month old child. Two years later, on January 10, 1932, a fledgling group of six guys met atop Mt Raufjellet and planned the very first Birkebeinerrennet, which would follow a 59km route through the a mountainous region in Northern Norway. 147 guys partook in this event (which happened that same year) and it was history in the making. 

Now, almost a century later, the Birkie Ski Race is an annual event held in several locations around the world, including the Canadian edition which is this coming weekend and guess what... you're invited! For enthusiasts of prairie sticking, grab your well waxed classic skis (no skate skis allowed) and get out to Cooking Lake/Blackfoot for the Edmonton Area's premier loppet. Course lengths include a family fun ski, a 7km, 13km, 31km, 55km lite & 55km with pack with entry prices varying by registered course length.

1iggdjb,https://i.redd.it/yk7kog38luge1.jpeg,CSL Plasma: Get Extra iGive Rewards® points after two donations for new donors! (Plus new donor bonus money) Using the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\
https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9\
\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I caught myself starting to do this and realized ""Emergency Emergency"" I'm not dancing on the floor but I am on the verge of becoming a maniac. 

I am so frustrated because I just got diagnosed a few months ago and learned all about mania (so I thought) and what causes it like poor sleep. Then I tried sleeping better and was told to stop my stimulant for ADHD, didn't, now on the side of mania again. I feel more like myself than ever but also in greater danger than I know.

My assumption was that since its an espresso or Americano the taste difference would not be that much. Plus I don't think of myself as an coffee aficionado lol.

(The Morpheus Missives),"For as long as I can remember, I've always had trouble sleeping. I was teenager by the time I realized it wasn't normal to lay awake for two or three hours before finally falling asleep, and even then, I only sleep for a couple hours. I tried everything to ease my condition. I've tried melatonin, sleeping pills, exercise, alcohol, marijuana, white noise, warm milk, sensory deprivation, therapy, Ambien, hypnosis, magnesium supplements, valerian root, changing my diet, tea, Ativan, yoga, hot baths, ice baths... the list goes on and on. Most things didn't work at all, and the few that did would result in me not getting any *restful* sleep. I've had doctors look me over and paid way too much for a battery of tests to identify a cause. Nothing was ever found, so I almost gave up and just accepted that I would be tired forever. However, a while ago, I finally found something that helped.

I started keeping a notepad on my nightstand next to my bed.

I would write down whatever I was thinking about, just letting my thoughts flow onto the page. The first time I tried it, I settled into bed with the pen and paper and just started writing whatever came to my mind.

“I'm in bed. I want to sleep. I wish I could find out what it's like to dream.”

That was the first thing I wrote. Then, I was waking up the next morning feeling refreshed for the first time I could remember in my life. I actually cried a little once I realized I had slept for eight full hours. If that seems like an over reaction, you've never suffered from severe long term insomnia.

I looked back over the notebook after I calmed down a bit, just to see what all I had written. I remembered the first three sentences, but there was a little more after that.

“I hear a voice in the void. It is screaming. I can hear you.”

I didn't think too much of this, just chalking it up to ramblings of a man on the edge of somnolence, but it did creep me out a little. However, I didn't think about it beyond that as I went through my day.

The next night, I settled in a started jotting on the notepad.

“Was it a fluke? Will this work again? I hope I dream this time.”

I woke up the next morning after that feeling even better than I had the first time. I had a dream of an endless range of beautiful mountains that I was flying through. It was the most beautiful experience of my life. I looked over the pad to see if there would be anymore strange writing there, and I was not disappointed.

“Enjoy the dream.”

I was more than a little rattled by this. It was so simple that I could easily dismiss it, but it stuck in my mind like a splinter. I thought about it all that day, unable to shake the cancerous thought. I kept telling myself that I had written it on the edge of sleep and probably felt the dream coming on. It was probably something I wrote while on the edge of consciousness and I just wanted to tell myself to enjoy the experience. I mean, I did enjoy it immensely. I think it was the first dream I had ever had. Still, I felt a little unnerved by it all.

I settled back into my bed for the third night and pulled out the notepad and pen. I took a few deep breaths and let my thoughts wander freely from my head to the page.

“I loved the dream last night. I've never felt this good in my entire life. The weird messages are a little creepy, but I shouldn't let it get to me.”

That night, I dreamed of laying in my backyard, staring up at the stars twinkling like ice shards in the black sky. My fire pit was crackling lazily next to me. I couldn't see it from my position, but I could actually feel the warmth of the flames safe guarding me against the chill of the evening. It wasn't as exciting as flying around the mountains in my previous dream, but I didn't mind that. It was peaceful.

I woke up and looked at the notepad, wondering what strange note I had left myself this time.

“Don't let it unnerve you. Just watch the stars. You'll soon walk among them.”

The peace of the dream faded immediately as I read that final sentence. There was something sinister about it that I couldn't place my finger on. Walk among the stars? What the hell did that mean?

I felt a strange sense of foreboding for the rest of the day. I work at a warehouse as a certified forklift operator, which means my mind has plenty of opportunities to wander as I load pallets onto trucks or stack them in designated holding areas. The whole day, as I listened to the drone of the forklift's motorized workings, I kept wondering what that final message meant and kept coming up with nothing. I was still adjusting to all the extra energy the sleep was providing me with though, so I wasn't ready to stop using the notepad method yet.

I got home and actually felt energetic enough to cook myself a nice dinner of pan seared pork chops with fried apple and onion slices, then deglazed the pan with chicken stock and added ground mustard seed as well as butter to make a sweet and savory sauce to top it with. It was exquisite, and by the time I finished eating, all my anticipation had drained away.

I got in bed and reached for my pen and notepad to begin jotting down whatever came into my mind.

“I've decided I'm going to stop stressing over these notes I'm leaving for myself. It's worth it to have a good night's sleep. I wonder what weird messages I'll leave for myself tonight?”

That's as much as I remember writing. That night, I had another dream. I was standing in front of a mirror, but the reflection was hazy, as if I was trying to look through a thick fog. The result was a dark silhouette standing in the mirror, leaning closer as I leaned closer and shifting when I shifted. I was transfixed by the reflection, curious as to what it looked like, but unable to clearly make it out. I reached a hand to my face and rubbed my chin in thought, then jolted awake as the figure suddenly waved a hand of its own volition.

My heart was pounding in my ears as I sat upright in my bed. I felt a pang of dread as I leaned over to look at my notepad. The message this time obliterated any chance for dismissing the notes as meaningless.

“There not from yourself. I see you.”

I didn't use the notepad that night. I just laid there, too scared to sleep, no matter how desperately I wanted to. Unfortunately, I had become acclimated to sleeping regularly, and the exhaustion I felt as I watched the night sky through my window turn from black to gray was worse than it had ever been. I almost called into work, but forced myself to go through the motions anyways.

I started feeling dumb, realizing I was being paranoid. I had cost myself the perfection of a night's rest and purchased miserable lethargy in its stead. It was a fool's bargain and I decided I would put my fears to the side this evening. I was still afraid of what these messages meant, but I was more afraid to go back to the hell that takes the place of the world when one is denied nocturnal respite.

I got into my bed and picked up the pen and notepad, hesitating only a moment as my eyes lingered on that final message. I shook the thought from my head, and pushed on.

“This is ridiculous. I'm myself. I'm leaving these notes. There is no other explanation. I'm done with being afraid.”

It was short and sweet, right to the point. I felt my eyes grow heavy as I was barely able to finish that last word and the ocean of sleep pulled me beneath its heavenly waves. Yet, those heavenly waves washed me ashore on the beaches of hell itself.

I was in some sort of dark cavern, the only light coming from guttering torches planted in the stone floor. They were scattered all about the enormous space, but seemed concentrated around some sort of throne with a dark figure sitting on it. It was hard to focus on the figure, like its body was wreathed in twisting tendrils of smoke. I could see it was covered in chains though. I felt myself being drawn to the base of the great stone chair, like a current pulling me inexorably along, no matter how hard I kicked against it. I stood before the throne and could feel the creature staring at me, though I wasn't even sure if it had eyes.

I felt my hand reach out and was surprised to see I was holding a weathered key. The figure gestured at a lock resting at the foot of the throne. I didn't want to unlock it, fearing what this hellish thing full of malevolence would wrought upon me when it was unbound, but once again, I was powerless to halt myself. I inserted the key and the lock popped open with a loud click.

And then my eyes opened and I was laying in my bed. I was covered in sweat and shivering. I could see the notepad sitting there on the nightstand, glaring up at me with the same threatening aura I had felt emanating from the thing on the throne. With a shaking hand, I picked it up and read the newest message.

“You are my bridge now. You are my dream. The throne awaits.”

I had been convincing myself that all of this were just ramblings, that I was suffering from paranoia, but I decided in that moment that something horrible was happening. I threw the notepad across the room, feeling tears well up in my eyes. I felt sick, but didn't hesitate to get out of bed.

I went downstairs to make coffee and fought the twin urges to put all of this out of my mind while also trying to make sense of it. Both attempts were futile.

I was also horrified to see I had slept for twelve hours. It is the longest I'd ever slept in my life. I decided then and there that I would not be using the notepad again. If I was doomed to never sleep a day again in my life, so be it. I'd rather die exhausted than let that... thing... have its way.

I went through my day as normal, doing my laundry, cleaning my home, shopping for groceries. As the banality of the day dragged on, I felt the tension filling my body began to ease a little. After all, life would continue as it had before the notepad. It may not be pleasant, but it would be familiar.

Unfortunately, that night I experienced a sensation I had never felt before. As the day degraded into night, I felt a strange heaviness around my eyes and realized that must be what it feels like to be sleepy. I fought the feeling all the way until midnight, then could fight it no longer. I laid down in my bed, spying the notepad from across the room laying on the floor where I had thrown it. If I had the energy, I would of gotten up and thrown it in the garbage, but I couldn't have left my bed if my house had been on fire.

The mounting dread did nothing to stay the hand of drowsiness that pulled my eyelids down, down, down into a darkness so complete that even my thoughts were dark blanks. After a while, I began to see pinpricks of light in the darkness, which confused me. I still felt like I was awake, but there they were, a multitude of stars shining from the inky well of the void I was in.

I was in a starry abyss, and by my side, though it was hard to make out, was the smoke wreathed figure walking with me. It spoke to me, spoke through me. It was my own voice, but the thing had hijacked it to communicate with me.

“Kneel before me and you shall walk among the stars.”

Suddenly, the stars winked out and I was shrouded in the darkness once more. For a moment, there was no light and no sound, but that only lasted for a couple seconds. Suddenly, I was on fire. My skin was burning and I tried to scream, but the silence persisted as I was consumed. I could feel my muscles contracting as they cooked, twisting me into a fetal position as I quivered in agony. The thing spoke again with my voice.

“Stand against me and you shall burn.”

I woke up on the floor next to my bed. I must have been thrashing around in my sleep because my blankets and sheets were twisted around me To my absolute horror, the notepad was next to me, and in large words that were hastily scrawled across the entire page was a new message.

“I am near.”

I looked at the clock and saw I had slept for fourteen hours. I called into my job and explained to my boss that I was sick, which wasn't exactly a lie. He wasn't happy, but accepted the explanation easily enough. I spent the day shopping for supplies for the evening. I was going to fight this. I would try everything to avoid kneeling before it.

I bought coffee and energy drinks, enough to give a rhino a heart attack. Hell, I'd of bought cocaine if I knew where to get drugs.

I got home and even though the sun was only just setting, I could feel that same sensation of exhaustion creeping into my body. I sat on my couch and began drinking all the caffeine I could. It didn't seem to help, and anger began to seep through me. I stormed upstairs and grabbed that damn notepad, went into my backyard and burned it. As the flames devoured the notepad, I thought of the dream where I had been on fire and shuttered. I couldn't shake the recognition of how similar the black flakes of burning paper were to my skin in the dream. Still, after the notepad was reduced to ash, I felt a little better. I went back inside and continued drinking energy drinks while watching TV.

I glanced at the clock every so often, noting the slow passage of time. Each hour felt like another victory, and before long, I was watching the sun dissolve the night sky. I had made it. I felt a bittersweet happiness, longing to feel the rest I had felt when I first used the notepad, but decided a pyrrhic victory was better than a total loss.

I got dressed and headed to work, attempting to return to some routine. I felt less and less tired as I went through the motions, driving my forklift and moving product about the warehouse. As I worked, my boss yelled my name out and waved me down. I got off the forklift and made my way to him.

“Feeling better?”

“Yea, I think so.”

“Good, we need all hands right now. Next time, if you're not going to be able to make it, make sure to call earlier. It gives me time to line up another driver on the schedule to cover your spot.”

“Yes sir. Sorry about that.”

“That's alright, just try to be better about it. The reason I waved you down though is someone is in the front office to see you. Seemed important.”

I felt a little confused, but started heading that way. Truthfully, I didn't have any idea who it could be considering I don't socialize with anyone. That's not an exaggeration, I don't have friends, I don't go out and I don't have any living family. My existence is solitary, a result of my insomnia making it impossible to talk to people for any other reason than necessity.

By the time I reached the office, my mind was racing. I walked in and saw the receptionist look up at me. She was talking on the phone and held up a single finger, silently mouthing the words “one moment.”

I took a seat on one of the cheap chairs against the wall and politely waited for her to finish. She hung up the phone after a while and called out to me.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, there's a man to see you in the conference room.”

I nodded my appreciation and made the short walk to the conference room. I walked in and screamed as I saw what was on the other side of the door.

The conference room was gone. In its place was the dark cavern with the throne. The unchained and smoke shrouded figure stood up as I walked in and seemed to grow taller as it did so. I turned to run, but the door had vanished behind me. I collapsed to the ground, gasping for air as the fire began to consume me once more. The thing slowly walked towards me until it loomed over me, its dark form vanishing in a wreath of flames and smoke from my smoldering skin.

I heard it speak, this time in a voice that sounded like stone on stone mixed with the crackle of fire.

“I have arrived.”

I woke up in my bedroom, my whole body aching. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the walls of my bedroom had large words covering every inch of them.

“I have arrived.”

The message was scrawled over and over again. My heart was beating in my ears and I screamed aloud in frustration. I checked my phone and saw I had been asleep for almost two days.

I know this will be my last few moments of consciousness. I don't know how I know that, but I do. I know that I have a choice to make. I've become convinced that the entity doing this to me is the devil, or some kind of demon. It is something of pure evil. If it comes through into our world, it will bring about the end of everything.

I don't know why this has happened to me. I'm not sure that matters anymore. I have to choose if I'm going to kneel and damn everyone to this things machinations or pick the other option.

I wanted to send out this last message to the world I hardly ever spoke to. No one may read it and even those that do will likely never care, but I needed to make sure there was some record of what I've done and why I've done it. This isn't just my way of seeking some measure of solace in glorifying myself, or expressing self pity for my plight. This is my warning to you all. There is a thing wreathed in smoke and darkness, a thing that is trying to break into our world. I know it will not stop until it does. All it needs is someone to kneel to it.

I took a long time thinking this through, unsure if there was any other thing I could I do in my situation. Finally, I've come to the conclusion that there is no other way. This is not a decision that I made easily, but one I agonized over for as long as I could. I want to keep fighting, but I know that I've lost. Yet, even in my defeat, I can deny this enemy its most prized asset.

I'm looking at the rope hanging before me. I'm full of fear and misery, wishing there was any other thing I could do, but I feel my eyes growing heavy once again and know that I must act now. I won't have another chance once I slip away again.

If you ever wake up to find messages you don't remember writing and are visited by a smoke shrouded figure in your dreams, you must make this same choice.

My life has been a difficult one, full of loneliness and exhaustion. I fear the end of it none the less. Despite this, I still rather choose this than choose to kneel to that monster.

For as long as I can remember, I've always had trouble sleeping.

I got home and even though the sun was only just setting, I could feel that same sensation of exhaustion creeping into my body. I sat on my couch and began drinking all the caffeine I could. It didn't seem to help, and anger began to seep through me. I stormed upstairs and grabbed that damn notepad, went into my backyard and burned it. As the flames devoured the notepad, I thought of the dream where I had been on fire and shuttered. I couldn't shake the recognition of how similar the black flakes of burning paper were to my skin in the dream. Still, after the notepad was reduced to ash, I felt a little better. I went back inside and continued drinking energy drinks while watching TV.

I glanced at the clock every so often, noting the slow passage of time. Each hour felt like another victory, and before long, I was watching the sun dissolve the night sky. I had made it. I felt a bittersweet happiness, longing to feel the rest I had felt when I first used the notepad, but decided a pyrrhic victory was better than a total loss.

I got dressed and headed to work, attempting to return to some routine. I felt less and less tired as I went through the motions, driving my forklift and moving product about the warehouse. As I worked, my boss yelled my name out and waved me down. I got off the forklift and made my way to him.

“Feeling better?”

“Yea, I think so.”

“Good, we need all hands right now. Next time, if you're not going to be able to make it, make sure to call earlier. It gives me time to line up another driver on the schedule to cover your spot.”

“Yes sir. Sorry about that.”

“That's alright, just try to be better about it. The reason I waved you down though is someone is in the front office to see you. Seemed important.”

I felt a little confused, but started heading that way. Truthfully, I didn't have any idea who it could be considering I don't socialize with anyone. That's not an exaggeration, I don't have friends, I don't go out and I don't have any living family. My existence is solitary, a result of my insomnia making it impossible to talk to people for any other reason than necessity.

By the time I reached the office, my mind was racing. I walked in and saw the receptionist look up at me. She was talking on the phone and held up a single finger, silently mouthing the words “one moment.”

I took a seat on one of the cheap chairs against the wall and politely waited for her to finish. She hung up the phone after a while and called out to me.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, there's a man to see you in the conference room.”

I nodded my appreciation and made the short walk to the conference room. I walked in and screamed as I saw what was on the other side of the door.

The conference room was gone. In its place was the dark cavern with the throne. The unchained and smoke shrouded figure stood up as I walked in and seemed to grow taller as it did so. I turned to run, but the door had vanished behind me. I collapsed to the ground, gasping for air as the fire began to consume me once more. The thing slowly walked towards me until it loomed over me, its dark form vanishing in a wreath of flames and smoke from my smoldering skin.

I heard it speak, this time in a voice that sounded like stone on stone mixed with the crackle of fire.

“I have arrived.”

I woke up in my bedroom, my whole body aching. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the walls of my bedroom had large words covering every inch of them.

“I have arrived.”

The message was scrawled over and over again. My heart was beating in my ears and I screamed aloud in frustration. I checked my phone and saw I had been asleep for almost two days.

I know this will be my last few moments of consciousness. I don't know how I know that, but I do. I know that I have a choice to make. I've become convinced that the entity doing this to me is the devil, or some kind of demon. It is something of pure evil. If it comes through into our world, it will bring about the end of everything.

I don't know why this has happened to me. I'm not sure that matters anymore. I have to choose if I'm going to kneel and damn everyone to this things machinations or pick the other option.

I wanted to send out this last message to the world I hardly ever spoke to. No one may read it and even those that do will likely never care, but I needed to make sure there was some record of what I've done and why I've done it. This isn't just my way of seeking some measure of solace in glorifying myself, or expressing self pity for my plight. This is my warning to you all. There is a thing wreathed in smoke and darkness, a thing that is trying to break into our world. I know it will not stop until it does. All it needs is someone to kneel to it.

I took a long time thinking this through, unsure if there was any other thing I could I do in my situation. Finally, I've come to the conclusion that there is no other way. This is not a decision that I made easily, but one I agonized over for as long as I could. I want to keep fighting, but I know that I've lost. Yet, even in my defeat, I can deny this enemy its most prized asset.

I'm looking at the rope hanging before me. I'm full of fear and misery, wishing there was any other thing I could do, but I feel my eyes growing heavy once again and know that I must act now. I won't have another chance once I slip away again.

If you ever wake up to find messages you don't remember writing and are visited by a smoke shrouded figure in your dreams, you must make this same choice.

My life has been a difficult one, full of loneliness and exhaustion. I fear the end of it none the less. Despite this, I still rather choose this than choose to kneel to that monster.

(The Morpheus Missives),"For as long as I can remember, I've always had trouble sleeping. I was teenager by the time I realized it wasn't normal to lay awake for two or three hours before finally falling asleep, and even then, I only sleep for a couple hours. I tried everything to ease my condition. I've tried melatonin, sleeping pills, exercise, alcohol, marijuana, white noise, warm milk, sensory deprivation, therapy, Ambien, hypnosis, magnesium supplements, valerian root, changing my diet, tea, Ativan, yoga, hot baths, ice baths... the list goes on and on. Most things didn't work at all, and the few that did would result in me not getting any *restful* sleep. I've had doctors look me over and paid way too much for a battery of tests to identify a cause. Nothing was ever found, so I almost gave up and just accepted that I would be tired forever. However, a while ago, I finally found something that helped.

I started keeping a notepad on my nightstand next to my bed.

I would write down whatever I was thinking about, just letting my thoughts flow onto the page. The first time I tried it, I settled into bed with the pen and paper and just started writing whatever came to my mind.

“I'm in bed. I want to sleep. I wish I could find out what it's like to dream.”

That was the first thing I wrote. Then, I was waking up the next morning feeling refreshed for the first time I could remember in my life. I actually cried a little once I realized I had slept for eight full hours. If that seems like an over reaction, you've never suffered from severe long term insomnia.

I looked back over the notebook after I calmed down a bit, just to see what all I had written. I remembered the first three sentences, but there was a little more after that.

“I hear a voice in the void. It is screaming. I can hear you.”

I didn't think too much of this, just chalking it up to ramblings of a man on the edge of somnolence, but it did creep me out a little. However, I didn't think about it beyond that as I went through my day.

The next night, I settled in a started jotting on the notepad.

“Was it a fluke? Will this work again? I hope I dream this time.”

I woke up the next morning after that feeling even better than I had the first time. I had a dream of an endless range of beautiful mountains that I was flying through. It was the most beautiful experience of my life. I looked over the pad to see if there would be anymore strange writing there, and I was not disappointed.

“Enjoy the dream.”

I was more than a little rattled by this. It was so simple that I could easily dismiss it, but it stuck in my mind like a splinter. I thought about it all that day, unable to shake the cancerous thought. I kept telling myself that I had written it on the edge of sleep and probably felt the dream coming on. It was probably something I wrote while on the edge of consciousness and I just wanted to tell myself to enjoy the experience. I mean, I did enjoy it immensely. I think it was the first dream I had ever had. Still, I felt a little unnerved by it all.

I settled back into my bed for the third night and pulled out the notepad and pen. I took a few deep breaths and let my thoughts wander freely from my head to the page.

“I loved the dream last night. I've never felt this good in my entire life. The weird messages are a little creepy, but I shouldn't let it get to me.”

That night, I dreamed of laying in my backyard, staring up at the stars twinkling like ice shards in the black sky. My fire pit was crackling lazily next to me. I couldn't see it from my position, but I could actually feel the warmth of the flames safe guarding me against the chill of the evening. It wasn't as exciting as flying around the mountains in my previous dream, but I didn't mind that. It was peaceful.

I woke up and looked at the notepad, wondering what strange note I had left myself this time.

“Don't let it unnerve you. Just watch the stars. You'll soon walk among them.”

The peace of the dream faded immediately as I read that final sentence. There was something sinister about it that I couldn't place my finger on. Walk among the stars? What the hell did that mean?

I felt a strange sense of foreboding for the rest of the day. I work at a warehouse as a certified forklift operator, which means my mind has plenty of opportunities to wander as I load pallets onto trucks or stack them in designated holding areas. The whole day, as I listened to the drone of the forklift's motorized workings, I kept wondering what that final message meant and kept coming up with nothing. I was still adjusting to all the extra energy the sleep was providing me with though, so I wasn't ready to stop using the notepad method yet.

I got home and actually felt energetic enough to cook myself a nice dinner of pan seared pork chops with fried apple and onion slices, then deglazed the pan with chicken stock and added ground mustard seed as well as butter to make a sweet and savory sauce to top it with. It was exquisite, and by the time I finished eating, all my anticipation had drained away.

I got in bed and reached for my pen and notepad to begin jotting down whatever came into my mind.

“I've decided I'm going to stop stressing over these notes I'm leaving for myself. It's worth it to have a good night's sleep. I wonder what weird messages I'll leave for myself tonight?”

That's as much as I remember writing. That night, I had another dream. I was standing in front of a mirror, but the reflection was hazy, as if I was trying to look through a thick fog. The result was a dark silhouette standing in the mirror, leaning closer as I leaned closer and shifting when I shifted. I was transfixed by the reflection, curious as to what it looked like, but unable to clearly make it out. I reached a hand to my face and rubbed my chin in thought, then jolted awake as the figure suddenly waved a hand of its own volition.

My heart was pounding in my ears as I sat upright in my bed. I felt a pang of dread as I leaned over to look at my notepad. The message this time obliterated any chance for dismissing the notes as meaningless.

“There not from yourself. I see you.”

I didn't use the notepad that night. I just laid there, too scared to sleep, no matter how desperately I wanted to. Unfortunately, I had become acclimated to sleeping regularly, and the exhaustion I felt as I watched the night sky through my window turn from black to gray was worse than it had ever been. I almost called into work, but forced myself to go through the motions anyways.

I started feeling dumb, realizing I was being paranoid. I had cost myself the perfection of a night's rest and purchased miserable lethargy in its stead. It was a fool's bargain and I decided I would put my fears to the side this evening. I was still afraid of what these messages meant, but I was more afraid to go back to the hell that takes the place of the world when one is denied nocturnal respite.

I got into my bed and picked up the pen and notepad, hesitating only a moment as my eyes lingered on that final message. I shook the thought from my head, and pushed on.

“This is ridiculous. I'm myself. I'm leaving these notes. There is no other explanation. I'm done with being afraid.”

It was short and sweet, right to the point. I felt my eyes grow heavy as I was barely able to finish that last word and the ocean of sleep pulled me beneath its heavenly waves. Yet, those heavenly waves washed me ashore on the beaches of hell itself.

I was in some sort of dark cavern, the only light coming from guttering torches planted in the stone floor. They were scattered all about the enormous space, but seemed concentrated around some sort of throne with a dark figure sitting on it. It was hard to focus on the figure, like its body was wreathed in twisting tendrils of smoke. I could see it was covered in chains though. I felt myself being drawn to the base of the great stone chair, like a current pulling me inexorably along, no matter how hard I kicked against it. I stood before the throne and could feel the creature staring at me, though I wasn't even sure if it had eyes.

I felt my hand reach out and was surprised to see I was holding a weathered key. The figure gestured at a lock resting at the foot of the throne. I didn't want to unlock it, fearing what this hellish thing full of malevolence would wrought upon me when it was unbound, but once again, I was powerless to halt myself. I inserted the key and the lock popped open with a loud click.

And then my eyes opened and I was laying in my bed. I was covered in sweat and shivering. I could see the notepad sitting there on the nightstand, glaring up at me with the same threatening aura I had felt emanating from the thing on the throne. With a shaking hand, I picked it up and read the newest message.

“You are my bridge now. You are my dream. The throne awaits.”

I had been convincing myself that all of this were just ramblings, that I was suffering from paranoia, but I decided in that moment that something horrible was happening. I threw the notepad across the room, feeling tears well up in my eyes. I felt sick, but didn't hesitate to get out of bed.

I went downstairs to make coffee and fought the twin urges to put all of this out of my mind while also trying to make sense of it. Both attempts were futile.

I was also horrified to see I had slept for twelve hours. It is the longest I'd ever slept in my life. I decided then and there that I would not be using the notepad again. If I was doomed to never sleep a day again in my life, so be it. I'd rather die exhausted than let that... thing... have its way.

I went through my day as normal, doing my laundry, cleaning my home, shopping for groceries. As the banality of the day dragged on, I felt the tension filling my body began to ease a little. After all, life would continue as it had before the notepad. It may not be pleasant, but it would be familiar.

Unfortunately, that night I experienced a sensation I had never felt before. As the day degraded into night, I felt a strange heaviness around my eyes and realized that must be what it feels like to be sleepy. I fought the feeling all the way until midnight, then could fight it no longer. I laid down in my bed, spying the notepad from across the room laying on the floor where I had thrown it. If I had the energy, I would of gotten up and thrown it in the garbage, but I couldn't have left my bed if my house had been on fire.

The mounting dread did nothing to stay the hand of drowsiness that pulled my eyelids down, down, down into a darkness so complete that even my thoughts were dark blanks. After a while, I began to see pinpricks of light in the darkness, which confused me. I still felt like I was awake, but there they were, a multitude of stars shining from the inky well of the void I was in.

I was in a starry abyss, and by my side, though it was hard to make out, was the smoke wreathed figure walking with me. It spoke to me, spoke through me. It was my own voice, but the thing had hijacked it to communicate with me.

“Kneel before me and you shall walk among the stars.”

Suddenly, the stars winked out and I was shrouded in the darkness once more. For a moment, there was no light and no sound, but that only lasted for a couple seconds. Suddenly, I was on fire. My skin was burning and I tried to scream, but the silence persisted as I was consumed. I could feel my muscles contracting as they cooked, twisting me into a fetal position as I quivered in agony. The thing spoke again with my voice.

“Stand against me and you shall burn.”

I woke up on the floor next to my bed. I must have been thrashing around in my sleep because my blankets and sheets were twisted around me To my absolute horror, the notepad was next to me, and in large words that were hastily scrawled across the entire page was a new message.

“I am near.”

I looked at the clock and saw I had slept for fourteen hours. I called into my job and explained to my boss that I was sick, which wasn't exactly a lie. He wasn't happy, but accepted the explanation easily enough. I spent the day shopping for supplies for the evening. I was going to fight this. I would try everything to avoid kneeling before it.

I bought coffee and energy drinks, enough to give a rhino a heart attack. Hell, I'd of bought cocaine if I knew where to get drugs.

1igg6sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1igg6sk/huge_rant_is_he_a_narcissist_give_me_some_clarity/,Huge rant. Is he a narcissist? Give me some clarity please,"A bit of a long one sorry! My ex (M30) and I (F31) were together 3.5 years, engaged and lived together. I believe he may be a narcissist. I'm having trouble identifying if it truly was abuse or if I have distorted events, as he would regularly tell me.

During our relationship he constantly criticized me for the smallest of things, from how I made him coffee to the way I drove. It would be subtle comments like, ''oh those pants are a bit tight'' or yelling at me and calling me a ''fucking idiot'' because I put a plastic bag in a different place than he wanted. It wasn't always extreme or nasty, and he would say he wasn’t trying to be critical, that he was trying to help me. On the more severe end of things, he would have extreme moments of anger, that would escalate out of nowhere. He would have excessive road rage and terrify me in the car with his driving, but would say it was okay as he was a good driver and claim he wasn’t being dangerous. This included things like excessive speeding, breaking road rules, evading arrest and aggression to other drivers

Whenever I would bring up anything that bothered me or was causing me distress, he would twist the scenario and be unbending, never actually compromising so I would give up trying to express my needs. Otherwise it would escalate into an argument which he would tell me I caused every single time. We moved to a location for his job, which resulted in me having no family and friends around, so I was reliant on him. Most of the time in arguments he will rant on and I will wind up confused or just give up. One time he got super aggressive and up in my face, screaming that I don't control him and went on a rant about how I am spoiled by my family and told me he could crush my brothers. He was in my face and was doing crush actions with his hands. He demanded to see my phone to see if I had been talking 'shit' about him to my family or friends. There are many similar fights, one was me just crying and asking him to leave me alone which resulted in him calling me ''fucking crazy''. Our next door neighbour heard and called out for me to leave him as he is abusive. I didn't at the time as I truly felt that it was my fault. He would give me silent treatment for days after these fights where I would try to engage, sometimes writing long letters trying to apologise and tell him my point of view.

The relationship escalated when we moved back to our hometown, and I reconnected with family and friends. He began making comments about how my profession had the highest rates of infidelity, that he could see every message I'd ever sent and was there anything he needed to know. He also asked who all the men were that I worked with and told me on another occasion that I had started to dress nicer. He was complaining that I was spending all daylight hours away from him, even though I worked and he often chose to go do things of an evening away from me. I didn't think anything of these comments at the time, but they began to add up. Things escalated and I ended up leaving him, I won’t go into the full details of what happened but I contacted the police. He was not physically abusive but I now realise he was emotionally and psychologically abusive. I have been going to counselling and have a good support system.

I have been considering reconciling with him, which I know probably seems crazy. I am fluctuating between what I know to be true and what he is now telling me. He is claiming that he has had a lot of self-reflection and is making a lot of changes. He says he wants the best for me and now realises that his inflexibility has been an issue. He has said a lot of things which he is willing to change, all things that I asked for years to happen, but he wouldn’t. He has implied that due to my age it is likely that I will be giving up the chance to have children. He has also said that as I cut things off it is now up to me to decide and then prove to him that I am a trustworthy and reliable partner. He has insinuated that my family, especially my mother, have played a large role in my decision to leave and that he doesn’t feel comfortable having a relationship with them and that I am too reliant on them.

He is quite intelligent and very skilled at manipulating things to sound a certain way without directly saying it. He is self diagnosed as autistic but I’m beginning to think that’s a way for him to justify his bad behaviour.

Or would you say that it's as bad as people say it is?,"I did an experiment yesterday out of curiosity. I wanted to see how well my Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2s blocked out noise by comparing it with the Soundcore Q45. The Soundcore Q45 is amazing when it comes to ANC. It's probably on the tier right below the most expensive ANC headphones out there such as the Bose QCs, Sony XM4/XM5, and Airpods Max. Soundcore really knows how to make good ANC.

For my experiment, I went to a busy mall near my house and I sat down in the food court to have coffee. I stayed in the food court for about an hour and I listened to music from different artists using both headphones in order to gauge how well the Crusher ANC 2 compared to the Q45s when it comes to the effectiveness of the ANC. This was during a Saturday and the food court was very busy. 

I listened to the following artists to test both headphones out on different types of music 

Taylor Swift (Pop, Country-Pop), JLo (Dance Pop), Green Day (Punk), Ed Sheeran (Soft Pop, Acoustic, Folk), Niall Horan (Acoustic), Harry Styles (Retro Sounding Pop), Adele (heavy on piano and vocals), Lewis Capaldi (heavy on piano and vocals), Sabrina Carpenter (Pop), Chappell Roan (Retro Sounding Pop), Olivia Rodrigo (Pop Rock).

  
Here's what I can conclude...

The Crusher ANC 2 is extremely close to the Q45 when it comes to ANC performance. With the Q45s, I could listen to my music comfortably in the food court. The same can be said for the Crusher ANC 2s. The ANC on the Crushers was a great help and I was able to listen to my music comfortably. The food court was very busy and I stayed there for quite a while to really gauge how good the ANC of the Crushers were. They blocked out nearly as much noise as the Q45. If the Q45 is rated as perfect 10 when it comes to ANC for non premium headphones, the Crusher ANC 2s are a solid 9.5. Truth be told, you probably wouldn't even notice the difference unless you really analyzed the headphones closely and forced yourself to point out the discrepancies in ANC. Given the performance of the Crusher ANC 2s in this regard, the same can be said for the Hesh ANC as well. I own a Hesh ANC and it cancels noise just as well as the Crusher ANC 2. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think that the ANC used in Skullcandy products is actually effective and not as bad as people say it is?",1,1738553456.0,Skullcandy,0,1.0,False

I've had some sort of hard to describe brain fogginess for maybe 15+ years now. I just haven't felt sharp for the longest time. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I don't feel like I'm even able to perfectly focus on my own face. It's a weird feeling. Just yesterday, I was watching TV and I was getting super annoyed with how hard it was for me to focus on the picture.

I don't have any known issues... I sleep great, my gut is as regular as a German train schedule, I've been lifting weights and exercising religiously for 20+ years, my blood is clean, my BP is 120/70, my cholesterol is low, I've taken allergy tests and I'm slightly allergic only to molds, etc etc etc.

I don't do drugs and hardly ever drink. I maybe smoke weed once a week (but this is a more recent thing). But, I'm a heavy coffee and tea drinker. I'm thinking of stopping cold turkey (and dealing with the withdrawals) for a couple weeks to see how I feel.

-bought a generator, it’s not enough for the whole house but I scored a good deal in a refurbished Jackery 880, it’s better then nothing. Especially considering my main concern is keeping my exotic pets alive, not myself. 

-bought canned cat and dog food, longer shelf life then dry.  On the same note my cat has his appointment tomorrow to get his updated rabies. 

-unsubscribed from email lists and deleted accounts I dont need 

-Costco trip, lots of shelf stables. Including coffee!

About a month ago, my friend and I (both women in our mid-20s) were at the Barnes & Noble in the Irvine Spectrum when two other women, around our age, approached us. They seemed friendly at first, saying they were looking for book recommendations because they’d only ever read the Bible and wanted to branch out. We gave them some suggestions, but as the conversation went on, it started to feel off.

They began asking us personal question —where we were from, if we went to church groups, what we liked to do for fun, etc. I initially assumed they were leading up to a church invite, but that never happened. They didn’t mention a specific group, ask for our numbers, or suggest meeting up. The conversation just awkwardly ended, and my friend and I left feeling unsettled but figured maybe it was just a weird interaction.

Then today, the exact same thing happened to me at the Barnes & Noble in The District. This time I was alone, and two different girls approached me, complimenting my purse to start the conversation. Again, it quickly got awkward. They asked odd questions like whether a Bible would fit in my purse and for local coffee shop recommendations—despite saying they were from Huntington Beach, which is close enough that they should know the area. Just like before, they asked if I knew of any church groups but never actually invited me to one or mentioned a specific church.

Both times, the conversation had the same pattern—girls from Huntington, vague church mentions, personal questions—but no actual invite or clear reason for the conversation. It just left me with a really weird feeling, especially since it happened twice.

Has anyone else experienced this? At first, I thought it was just an odd church outreach, but now I’m wondering if it could be something more like some kind of cult recruitment? A trafficking tactic?

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

My friends and I are making a mini version of the Hide and Seek game that would be played on a university campus. We’re thinking of curses right now and I was wondering if I could get y’alls opinion on some that we’ve been thinking of! 

[Here’s a link to all curses in the official game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1jbE0vujOeOzc4oSfkqbOxmL9IiEaln2w_IOkmN60rQY/htmlview?pli=1#)

And here’s what we’re thinking

Curse of the tired student?? {{better names would be nice}} (Play on curse of the mediocre travel agent)

* Seekers must go to the coffee shop you tell them to and purchase an item. Only after doing so, may they ask another question/continue on. The coffee shop must be within a 5 minute walk of the seekers current location
* If you do not want to purchase an item, you must wait until the person who would’ve been in front of you completely receives their order to leave and ask another question.
* {{Should I add an addendum saying something like “if it has been more than 7 minutes, you may ask another question, but you still must wait in line.”}} (Cause if played at the right time, it could be 15+ minute wait, making it on par with a large game)
* Casting cost: The coffee shop must be further from you than the seekers



Curse of the studious (play on curse of the cairn)

* Select one of the following
* [Math Minute](https://webmathminute.com/online-start) (1 minute, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)[Knoword](https://knoword.com/play) (Intermediary, 1 minute)?? {{Anyone have a suggestion for a third game}}
* You may play the game up to three times. After which, you tell the seekers your highest score and they must match or beat before asking their next question.
* Casting cost: Play the game.



Curse of the Frozen snowman

* The seekers must build a 1-3 foot tall snowman (dependant on weather/snow stickiness, to be decided day of game) with the following: a) A nose (made of material different then the rest of the items) b) Three buttons b) A smile + eyes c) Arms
* Seekers may not use live branches.
* Casting cost: Discard 1 card {{Any better ideas}}



Curse of the Gambler’s feet

* For the next 10 minutes, seekers must roll a d20 before taking a step in any direction, they may then take that many steps before rolling again.
* Casting cost: Roll a d20, if the number is even, the curse has no effect and is discarded.

  


Unchanged curses that we’re keeping, if they have time stuff, just slightly lowering it:

* Curse of the Labyrinth
* Curse of the Hidden Hangman
* Curse of the overflowing chalice
* Curse of the spotty memory
* Curse of the jammed door



We’re halving the deck, so ideally there’d be 12 curses. I’m at nine right now, so any help of thinking of new ones/which old ones would be best for this game would be super helpful! Thank you guys 



(Also I would love a curse that has something to do with pedways (walkways that go over street/connect multiple buildings), but I can’t think of a good one, any help would be appreciated!)

Then, we tried the Immigration Counter and they were kind enough to call in the paramedic to attend to my girlfriend. The paramedic diagnosed it as a second degree burn.

No change of clothes, nothing. We walked around the airport in stained clothing. Shops only sold perfume and confectionery. Staff looked at us with odd eyes, but no one did anything.

For breakfast I had oatmeal consisting of 1/4 cup oats, pinch of salt, small handful of pumpkin seeds, walnuts, flax, raisins, sweetened with maple syrup. This is my go to weekend breakfast meal and not pictured because it looks like a bowl of mush. 

Lunch was two eggs, a piece of persian bread, and some gai lan. 

Dinner was a chicken thigh with zaatar and hummus, eggplant with tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro and sumac, quinoa with black lentils, and some romaine for freshness. I really enjoyed it, especially since I've mostly been eating vegetarian plus fish once or twice a week. Canned sardines are a staple.

I had an orange and some grapes as well, and I'll probably have a couple dates stuffed with peanut butter and carob chips as an evening snack.

I also drink a decaf coffee with cashew or oat milk and sugar, a matcha with soymilk and honey, and a decaf black tea with soymilk every day. Usually I'll also have some fruity ginger tea and occasionally water, though during the cold months it's mostly tea.

They are the typical, entitled boomers who believe the world needs to cater to their whims. Going to restaurants with them involves them getting a manager nearly every time we go out and yelling out complaining. Today was no exception but fortunately, I was able to undo the damage my dad tried to inflict on a poor waitress today. 

We were meeting my dad for brunch before flying home at a very busy spot. He decided when he got there he wasn't going to eat so after we all ordered, he ordered a decaf coffee and boarding else. This was fine. 

The kitchen was clearly overwhelmed by the rush though and his coffee wasn't coming out quickly. The waitress came out and apologized, letting him know that there was no decaf made so they needed to brew it. After 15 minutes, still no coffee and he was getting antsy. The waitress came by again, apologized, and let him know it was coming. 

After she left my dad started complaining to me that she was screwing with him and went off to the kitchen. I figured he was just trying to get it himself. When he came back after another 5 or do minutes, he smugly let me know that he'd have his coffee and the manager was going to handle the waitress. 

I was like...what? Handle the waitress? According to my dad, she had been purposefully denying him coffee and was rudely blowing him off. He didn't tell the manager she had forgotten the coffee, he said she'd been doing it on purpose. 

Meanwhile the waitress had come over to profusely apologize (she had no idea yet that he'd talked to the manager) and started talking to my wife. From our conversation later she apparently was on the verge of tears because she was new and she thought one of the other waitresses was messing with her. (I actually think that was happening... someone else had taken our order and she came back and double checked the tickets with us.  They were all wrong)

I left to ""use the restroom"" and found the manager and asked if my dad complained about our waitress, which he confirmed. I told him that my dad is really hard to take to restaurants and always complains about the service. I let him know she'd been great and nothing he said was true. The guy's entire demeanor changed as I talked to him. He thanked me and said if I hadn't said that to him, she would have been reprimanded.

I started my channel on a lark during the pandemic.

My kid was going abroad to study, and one of her classes required video editing. In a past life I was tangentially involved with the subject so I offered assistance. But after her course was over, I had a software suite that wasn't being used, and was wondering if I could use it toward something. the criteria being:  
1. should be something I find interesting, hopefully others too  
2. have plenty of subject matter readily available for relatively low cost  
3. low startup and no running costs or time per video(supplies, scripting, editing)  
4. while geographically limited, evergreen-ish material not swayed by seasonality or time  
5. something I could easily do during the pandemic within the confines of my home.

and the channel was born.  
I'm not going to win academy awards for anything, my scripting, lighting, and Kevin Smith level of camera work are nothing to write home about.  
The only additional purchases I made specifically for the channel were a camera mount and a wind screen. the rest I cobbled together from around the house.

I don't know if others exist within the same niche; I create in a vacuum as I think ""comparison is the thief of joy"".  I purposefully haven't searched for others covering the same category so I don't know if they exist, and if I am similar to someone else, it truely is coincidence.  I also don't know if they are copying me, but seeing my numbers, I doubt I'm a viable target.

But making videos remains fun, and that's really all that matters to me.

1igepx7,https://brewlog.coffee/,Digital Coffee Journal,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a project called BrewLog—a simple, digital coffee journal designed to help coffee enthusiasts track their tastings, take notes, and log brewing methods.

As a coffee nerd myself, I’ve always found it tricky to keep consistent notes on what worked (and what didn’t) with different beans, grind sizes, and brew methods. I’ve been using a physical coffee journal (just a regular notebook), but it quickly got messy and hard to organize. So, I started looking around for a digital coffee journal that could solve this problem. To my surprise, I could only find one or two options—and they were really outdated, lacking the features I wanted.

That’s when I decided to build BrewLog.

What BrewLog Does:
	•	Track your brews: Log details like origin, roast, grind size, brew time, and tasting notes.
	•	Discover patterns: See what techniques lead to your favorite cups.
	•	Perfect your process: Learn from your own data to improve over time.
	•	Coffee Map: Visualize where you’ve had coffee from around the world.

I was the only person cooking in the house. I use to purchase this specific brand of seasoning as a collective item because I really liked the bottle and they became extremely rare to find in stores and then non-existent. So I refilled the bottles with other brands of seasonings. I took the collectables with me (most of the bottles were empty) and I left the other seasonings. I didn’t touch anything in the fridge because now he’d have to cook for himself. He also refused my offer to organize and clean the kitchen before I left, stating that he’d clean it himself. 

He’s now mad at me that I “took all of the seasoning”. Mind you, the collectibles I had were stylishly lined off on the stovetop so it was a noticeable difference, but I told him the other seasonings (which was practically every seasoning I used to cook with, were in the cupboard). 

Two months after I moved out he was due to travel and asked me to look after his dogs and I agreed even though it was completely last minute and a lack of preparation on his end. Told me I can take anything from the fridge I wanted that was on the verge of going bad…highlighting the produce drawers that were untouched from the day I moved out. I knew they were most likely rotten and I refused to search through it because I would feel compelled to clean it and that was no longer my responsibility. I use to clean the fridge every week to make space for new groceries and I cooked everyday so there was a high turnover rate and the fridge was well maintained. Now there’s a bunch of rotten stuff and dead bugs so I’m not messing with that.

I took a creamer I really liked and a half consumed bag of flavored ground coffee I bought before I moved out that I initially decided to leave there but I took with me to try a cup since it was a unique flavor. I left all the instant coffee and cappuccino mix. He’s now angry that I took “all of the coffee” and the creamer when he basically told me to help myself.

Now I’m the asshole because I told him I won’t move another item without his sign off ",1,1738549834.0,u_miley-bee,0,0.99,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I had a great call with her and feel like I left being super confident that I’d get an interview after asking where I stand with other candidates, what they’re looking for, etc. I asked her if I could reach out to the senior rep for the company she’s working with. She said not yet and to wait until the interview process. 

So I didn’t reach out to the senior rep, but I found the person who was the associate rep and moved up, which opened the role for the associate position (aka who I would be working under). I requested to connect on LinkedIn and didn’t get anywhere with it. After a few days, I found her Instagram and sent a “I don’t want this to be overstepping, but want to congratulate you on your promotion and also ask if I can meet at one of your sites and ask a few questions about the role over some coffee or a phone call if that’s better”.

We split chores in the house evenly, but since living here, I've noticed a problem with personal dishes.

It's typically a small issue, like the counter is overcrowded or all 12 of our spoons are on vacation (this is our polite way of saying that people need to bring dishes down from their room). 

My issue this time, though, has to do with our dishes bin: in the kitchen, everyone has a designated spot to put their dishes if they need to do them later. It's helped declutter the counters a bit, although most of the large pots and pans are still left dirty on the stove and countertops for days at a time. The problem with the dishes bin is that once the mess is out of sight, it's out of mind. 

Most of the time, people clean their dishes within two weeks. Occasionally something will go bad or they can't fit anymore dishes there and it's a reminder for them to clean up. However, on to the issue at hand, one of my housemates has had dishes sitting in their bin for almost a month. 

The most notable object is a large mason jar with coffee in it that has dried significantly and produced a large amount of mold. Their dishes are also spilling out on top of the counter, as they have no more room in their bin. I don't like having something so unhealthy growing in our food space, and their extra dishes are taking up space others use for cooking.

Normally, I would be fine with asking them to clean up. However, about three weeks ago, they told our house about a loss they experienced. I don't want to go into details for their privacy, but it had put a strain on them and they asked for some grace on their dishes. 

Everyone agreed and consoled them, and I did as well. However, it's been three weeks now and the bioterror is still growing. 

Other info: 
- I'm a working student, so I barely have time for my own life and dishes, so doing their dishes for them is out of the question. 
- We don't have a dishwasher. Our house is 100 years old and there literally isn't space.
- While we do have meetings for our house on a regular basis, I would likely bring this up with them privately, in person.

BREAKING: Local Spades Scorekeeper Achieves Self-Awareness, Desperately Wants to Help You Play Cards

In what experts are calling ""a breakthrough in unnecessary digital innovation,"" [Spadesinator.com](http://Spadesinator.com) has emerged from its recent update more eager than ever to assist card players in keeping score during their spades games, whether they want help or not.

""We've made it so simple, your grandmother could set up a game before finishing her morning coffee,"" said lead developer, while demonstrating the new pre-configured scorekeepers. ""Though we're still keeping the complex customization options for those users who enjoy spending more time setting up their scorekeeper than actually playing cards.""

The update introduces optional user accounts, allowing spades enthusiasts to preserve their game history and reuse scorekeepers they’ve customized. ""It's perfect for people who lie awake at night wondering how many bags they collected in that game from three months ago,"" explained one beta tester.

Despite these improvements, [Spadesinator](https://spadesinator.com) maintains its core mission of enabling users to score their spades games while accommodating their questionable house rules.

1igegzf,https://i.redd.it/ir9xt6ad3uge1.jpeg,Creating a Cosy Floor-Seating Space - Need Plant & Layout Suggestions!,"Hey everyone, I’m working on making my living room a cosy, floor-seating space, and I’d love some input! I really like the laid-back, boho vibe, and I’m aiming for a setup that maximizes comfort while keeping things minimal but warm.

What I’ve Got So Far:

Floor seating setup with pillows and a rug

A solid amount of natural light from two south facing windows (I live in NYC)

Some plants! (including a money tree that’s doing well)

A guitar & amp setup near the corner


What I’m Looking For:

1. More plants – What should I add? Thinking of some trailing plants or a corner plant stand.


2. Window bar utilization – The bars open outward, so I was thinking of hanging planters or maybe a small herb garden?


3. General cozy vibes – Would a low coffee table, lanterns, or extra seating (like poufs) make sense?


4. Storage without killing the vibe – I like the open feel, but I still need spots to store books or random things.



Any suggestions for plant placement, decor, or general cozy improvements would be amazing! Thanks in advance!",13,1738549200.0,malelivingspace,2,1.0,False

If you want to approach me,  just do it. You said you didn't want anything with me, so i left and i will not approach you. Don't come in with your bullshit insecurities. All I've ever wanted was to be able to be sweet and loving and supportive. I've never wanted anyone else since the day we met. I don't want to have to keep proving myself. I just want to be in love and be loved. You can start by telling me you need me in your life. You need me next to you to heal. Tell me you want to make things right. Tell me you long for my warmth and my energy. Tell me you finally see what I have been trying to offer. Tell me you're ready to leap. To grow. To fly. Tell me you want to be my fella. That you're ready to grow old with me and make people sick with how in love we are. Tell me you want to be my calm be my support and you're ready to accept mine. Tell me you can't get enough of our crazy adventures and you need it in your life. That you want me in every memory you make from now on.  You're ready to romanticize our life. Yes our life. Ready to have Sundays mornings with crazy kids and breakfast and coffee and ukulele sarinades. Ready for all of the little things and all the big things.  Ready to explore all of my depths and let me into yours.  Tell me I'm the only one you want to spend your life learning. That you're done running, no matter what the discomfort is. 
If that's not what you're putting on the table... it just isn't what I want. I will never choose you over my peace and I want to be that in your life.  A peaceful place. When the world is burning chaos,  I want us to both know we are the calm in the middle of whatever the storm is.  I will never be hidden again. I'll never be made small. Either take me as I am and I do the same. We strive to love one another through our differences. Honor those differences. Respect those differences. But love so fucking hard it cracks the earth wide open.

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city as she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing with excitement with her smile saying it all as she rode through the town passing by people as some would wave as she passed by

With the feeling of nothing could stop this girl from Trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety. Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets. She would often ride her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape she even had a name for her bike she would often call it Quicksilver. 

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More then often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else’s life other then her own. 

But for now it was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked often finding herself dreaming of life on her own on her bike.

Often finding herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride  a trial that she was at the moment making her way through it  gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

The locals would refer to it as Angels Ravine For to anyone standing there could lookout over into the valley ahead.It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself. It was a quit place it was her place where she would come to often. To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself  with Grace finding that herLife was there in the mountains with her bike outside of her hometown. But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky for she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought. But she also had a light that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of her thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s.That night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“if I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself while also thinking to herself who else would she tell. For oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her in her Life with no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

The always the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams came they went as Grace found herself

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door holding her bike knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets her usual weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life on her bike loose and fast racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails telling passerby’s of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like it was her own little Heaven but this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster then normally having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. But this time was different this day she was just enjoying a nice quiet ride in the mountains. 

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with a few words but just looking out into it, It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would they be liked for as far back as Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she woke up being in a place with people around her. But not as family just people in her life a life that seemingly has went by all too fast with the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light then disappeared behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. The same dream as well as the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be another demission from what seemed to be another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her but everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said in the dream a name that was name of the girl in her dreams someone in the dream called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning light putting her hands up to her head. Grace just set there stunned thinking to herself on how real that dream was for unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there I was her. Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “ hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

“ then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” “ 

I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Grace then replying “ answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Grace your dreams.” 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“ it is you Grace and it is not.” 

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

“ me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life. 
But now in this Life you are her and she is not and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Grace then replying 

“ is this Heaven then and are you a Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 “ the dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home finding her usual self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace finding herself making her way through once more through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a project called BrewLog—a simple, digital coffee journal designed to help coffee enthusiasts track their tastings, take notes, and log brewing methods.

As a coffee nerd myself, I’ve always found it tricky to keep consistent notes on what worked (and what didn’t) with different beans, grind sizes, and brew methods. I’ve been using a physical coffee journal (just a regular notebook), but it quickly got messy and hard to organize. So, I started looking around for a digital coffee journal that could solve this problem. To my surprise, I could only find one or two options—and they were really outdated, lacking the features I wanted.

That’s when I decided to build BrewLog.

What BrewLog Does:
	•	Track your brews: Log details like origin, roast, grind size, brew time, and tasting notes.
	•	Discover patterns: See what techniques lead to your favorite cups.
	•	Perfect your process: Learn from your own data to improve over time.
	•	Coffee Map: Visualize where you’ve had coffee from around the world.
	•	Community Recommendations: See other users’ tasting notes to discover new coffees to try.

I’m currently preparing for launch, and I’ll be sending out emails soon to invite a small group of people for early access. If you’re interested in testing it out and giving me feedback, sign up here:
👉 https://brewlog.coffee/

I’d love your input:
	•	Would you find this useful?
	•	What features would you like to see? 
	•	Any design ideas you would like?

I’m genuinely looking to make this a good tool that people can use whenever they do tastings. Or to know whether this is just a bad idea. So any input (or brutal honesty) is appreciated. Thanks for reading!",1,1738549063.0,frenchpress,0,1.0,False
