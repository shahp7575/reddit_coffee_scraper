1ko4pc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ko4pc1/aita_for_still_being_upset_with_my_bridesmaid/,AITA for still being upset with my bridesmaid that missed my wedding?,"I (29f) got married a week ago it was a two-day affair. My husband and I come from different cultures, so we had two weddings to celebrate both our traditions.

I’m a really chilled person, and I stayed that way throughout all the planning. I chose to have an intimate wedding with just 24 guests. I had four bridesmaids  three are close friends from uni, and the fourth is someone I met six years ago at work but now also consider her a close friend. Let’s call her Lisa (30f). She’s the one that didn't make it.

Over the last year and a half, I really tried to make Lisa feel included, especially because the other bridesmaids already knew each other. She would often call saying she felt left out. There was even a group chat the bridesmaids had to plan my bachelorette party, and I wasn’t in it, but I still felt like I had to manage her emotions and keep reassuring her.

Some background: years ago, we were invited to Lisa’s wedding, but we missed the ceremony. Totally unintentional. On the day, my now-husband spilled coffee all over his only suit, so we had to rush out to buy him a new one. I was devastated to miss the ceremony and apologised loads when we got to the reception.

Since then, I’ve always made an effort to show up for her baby shower, christening, you name it. One time I literally stepped on glass at her house and needed surgery, haha. But that’s what friends do. I live five hours away from her, but I’ve gone to visit her quite a few times. She hasn’t visited me once, which I get having a baby makes travel hard.

To this day, she still jokes (maybe playfully?) about how we missed her wedding ceremony. So I know she is still somewhat annoyed by it, which is understandable. ( I was not a bridesmaid btw)

A week before my wedding, she got upset with me. I’d given her some suggestions for her hair, and she felt I was dictating, I only gave a suggestion because she had been trying to figure out what she wants.I apologised, and we moved on.

I knew she couldn’t attend the first day of the wedding due to work, but she was supposed to be there for the second day the white wedding. Then on the morning of that day, her husband messaged me saying, ""Sorry to do this, but Lisa is unwell and we won’t be able to attend today. Hope it’s a good day.""

I replied saying I hoped she was okay, but honestly, I was devastated. I noticed she was online not long after, but she didn’t message me herself.

Later that day, she finally sent a message saying she had an ocular migraine and couldn’t get out of bed. Sigh. (The wedding was 4 hours drive away from her.)

I told her I was really upset, but I also wished her a speedy recovery. Then, two days later, I saw her post on Instagram playing with her daughter in the garden. This bothered me which I know shouldn't. But she was out of bed and doing her thing.

I’m trying to forgive and move on. Logically, I know that’s what I should do. But emotionally, I’m really struggling. I think it’s because this wedding was so small and personal  every guest was someone I truly wanted there. Originally, I’d even invited her daughter, because I know Lisa struggles being away from her. She accepted, but a month before the wedding said it would be too much for a one year old. I understood.

But now I keep thinking about all the money I spent the food, flowers, hair, makeup, drinks, bridesmaids’ gifts. I paid for everything, and around £600 just went to waste.

I guess I just need help finding perspective. My husband said he’s never known me to hold a grudge for more than 20 minutes. If this was a situation she could avoid AITA for not letting it go?

Tldr: my close friend and bridesmaid missed my wedding due to an ocular migraine. I'm still hurt by it and don't know how to move on. ",2,1747411722.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I've been to a museum today. One, where you look at tiny artifacts, read lots of background info on big walls and tiny boards and in general spend a lot of time intensely looking and shuffeling from showcase to showcase and room to room. 

About at the end of part one of this 4 part exhibition, I shuffle through a collection of tiny pieces, when someone stands next so me. That's nothing special, you shuffle a bit more to let everyone see and take pictures and mind your busines.

This older man (late 40s maybe - not ugly, but not my type) starts staring at my face, approaching me and talking to me. Since I'm abroad right now, I just say ""I don't.."" and look at him bewildered. He the proceeds to talk to me in English. ""you have husband, you married?"" I'm like ""Uh... Yes?"" (I mean, a girl's gotta make up a little white lie sometimes) He THEN proceeds to come closer to me and says ""You wanna go coffee?"" And points towards the direction of the town. And I'm like... What??

So I say ""No... sorry!"" And he storms off and leaves the exhibition. And I stand there. Bewildered. Minding my own business. 

Mind you: I do not recall this man. We haven't had any eye contact. There was no communication.

One day my parents told me that I'll stop my home study,they said that I'll be joining a public high school in our town.I was astonished because it was my first time meeting other people at my age. The day of my first class came, I was kinda nervous because i don't know any of my classmates except my bestie jessie, and im scared that they will bully me because im deaf. On my first class our teacher told me to introduce my self and then on my first glance i saw a boy that i thought I've known before,he was like the faceless boy in my dream. His name is Kieth. I thought he was kind but i was wrong he was the one bullied me because im deaf.

One day on our p.e class we're playing dodge ball and then our professor didn't let me play because im deaf, and then i saw Kieth walking towards me, I thought he was gonna apologize about bullying me but he handed me a note saying ""go away you little deaf"" . I wondered ""what the heck is wrong with this boy he look nice but his attitude ugh its giving bad boy"" .I just sat around the corner and watch them play, and then Kieth caught my attention,he was so good at playing, he was fast ,and good at dodging balls— i noticed that he was kinda cute and handsome. Suddenly I just realized that i was blushing I ran to the restroom as fast as I can, I don't want others to see me blush because of Kieth, I hide in the cubicle until our class is over. I texted my bestie to text me if our class is over. During our recess I was with my best friend Jessie, we grab our food and proceed to the table we used to sit in, without realizing Kieth was sitting on our chair with his friends, I immediately told my  best friend to go sit on another table to avoid Kieth. My best friend and I uses our cellphone to text each other even when we're together as our communication, sometimes she uses sign language to talk to me.

In our Chemistry class Kieth and I was assigned as partners for a project, I ask him what's our plan for our project and he laugh at me he write on a piece of paper saying ""do you really think that I will work with you? haha, stop with your nonsense and go find another partner"" I texted my bestie if we can be partners for our project and she replied yes. When we finished our project I invited my bestie if we can have a coffee down the street so we can celebrate, on our way to the coffee shop I saw Kieth at the corner of the street helping stray cats, he was so gentle at the cats, then he saw me staring at him, I thought he was gonna say something but he smiled, it was my first time seeing Kieth smiling at me and he was so handsome.

One day I was at the library reading my favorite book and then suddenly Kieth handed me a paper with a word ""will you be my girlfriend?"" and then left, I was shocked ,"" did he really mean that?"" In my mind, I feel great about this because I really liked him but the sudden change of an attitude?, I was scared that he's only playing with my feelings for fun. I texted my best friend and told her what happened, she was so happy because someone finally like me at school but I said ""its Kieth and I don't know if he's really sincere about what he said"", ""omg ghurl go get him I thought you liked him I bet he already liked you"" my best friend replied. On Monday I tried to avoid Kieth on school because I just can't get over on what he did to me on my first day, I know I should forgive him but it was weird that he already want to be my girlfriend??Kieth was trying his best to get close to me but there's something in my gut that I can't explain.

One night I dreamed about this faceless boy again he was literally like Kieth but more gentleman I'm not sure if he's really Kieth but I can feel it. In my dream the faceless boy invited me on a date, he was so gentle we eat and laugh, it was a great night even though it was a dream I can really feel the connection between us. I think it was a sign to forgive Keith, I write a letter for Kieth saying ""Hi Kieth its Anna meet me at the park i wanna talk"". I called my bestie to give the letter to Kieth.

I saw Kieth waiting on the fountain I was nervous what if it was all just a joke. I approach him and say hi, I was shocked he was so gentle and show me a letter, the letter says ""hi"" I was confused I guess he's shy?he give me another letter saying ""im sorry for everything""huh? I guess he really is sorry. I said ""do you really wanna be my boyfriend? Because for me I've liked you since the first day I saw you"". He was shocked because he liked me too since I came. And then hours past we spend our time writing, it was so nice being with him. 

In my birthday my father gifted me a hearing aid. I was so excited because its the first time I'm hearing voices, I was so happy. I immediately talk to my  best friend and we have a lot to catch up with.

Once Kieth mentioned that faceless girl in her dreams he said that she was like me, he said that one time they had a date together, he said that he treated her so well and they eat and laugh all night. I was shocked because it was the same experience in my dream. I didn't tell him that i was experiencing the same dream because I don't want him to feel weird so I kept in myself. I told my best friend about what he told me, she laughed so hard that she fell down the chair,she said ""Ghurl what the heck, its sooo romantic its giving soulmates HAHHAHAHHAAH"". I just laughed because I don't know what to say Im still shock.

I dreamed again with this faceless boy. This time I know what to do. I saw him on the fountain, the same spot where Kieth and I confess with each other. I walk to him, I asked ""Are you real?"", ""of course I am"" ,he replied in a gentle voice,""and then what's your name"" i ask again,from this question It was the beginning of my new perspective because he answered ""Im Kieth, How about you?"" . And I answered ""I-Im Anna"". At school, Kieth approach me and tell me something he said ""do you know anna last night I dreamed about some girl named Anna like your name, she was the same girl i thought you,the one who's faceless"" I asked ""did you tell her your name?"", "" Yeah I said my name is Kieth"" he answered, and then i said ""its really me im experiencing it to, there's some faceless boy appearing in my dreams, and his name is Kieth"", Kieth answered ""wait really?!, what if its really us?"", ""that's running in my head too"" I replied. ""I really love you Anna"" ""I love you too Kieth"".

On our school Kieth and I are always together we go to our classes together, we read at the library together, we even go to lunch with each other. It was a great day being with Kieth. One night Kieth invited me  again on a date on my favorite, restaurant. It was so romantic, he even wear a formal suit, he's so handsome, Kieth handed me a bag, it was a dress, a beautiful dress he said that I can wear it tonight. We proceed to our table he reserved for us, the table was full of roses spreaded on it, we ordered our food, we eat and talk all night, it was a wonderful night.

On our graduation Kieth gifted me a bouquet of flowers it was my favorite flower, tulips. We graduated with high grades. We celebrated to our house with both of our parents, we hangout in to our balcony and watch the stars, I thought it will be a  perfect night, but then Kieth told me that he will be studying at states, he want me to come with him but I can't, I want to stay with my parents. He was fine with it he said that he will message me every minute.On his flight, I came with him so I can say good bye. He said that he will be back once he finished college and we will be together again. 

Few months past, I really missed Kieth I texted him that I wanna visit him on our summer break, Kieth replied that I can't because I will just get bored there. I was shocked that he wasn't want me there, I don't want him to be mad at me so I just did what he said.

A few months past, I received not a single message from Kieth, I tried to call him but his not answering his phone. So I wrote a letter for Kieth and send it to him. After my graduation I decided to go to states visit Kieth. On my flight there's a heavy rainstorm. My flight was cancelled and I'm glad so that I didn't go because I saw in the news that the plan where I was supposed to be crashed. Kieth suddenly called me crying his inaudible speaking is caused by his crying ""Anna, are you ok? I was so worried to you"" Kieth stated. I explained him that I didn't get into that flight because of the thunderstorm. Kieth sounded so worried, maybe that's why from the on he keeps on checking me up and asking how my day was.

One day Kieth texted me saying that he will visit me and spend his vacation in our country. Suddenly, I saw in the news that the plane where Kieth is at crashed while landing in the airport. I was devastated by the news because the love if my life died. I called Jessie to tell her about the incident. We talked all day and night, she comforts me while I was crying. I feel so lost like it's the end of the world, I can't do anything except to cry. 

Days, weeks, and months have pass, I still can't move on. I can't get over about Kieth's death I can't accept it. I've been isolated to other people since Kieth died because I was very devasted about it. I really don't know if I can move on in this tragic event. I'm glad that Jessie is always by my side comforting me.

Years go by, I'm with my family in a vacation trip in Hawaii. That was a nice day , and there I meet Kyle, his handsome aura and hus dark eyes and hair makes me fall in love with him already. It's already night and I decided to come to the bon fire near our cabin, I saw Kyle sitting across the fire. Kyle and I really had a great time chatting and laughing, we exchange our numbers and I hope to see him again.

Months had past and Kyle and I really became friends and talk about anything. Until one night, we decided to meet up since I knew that Kyle only live an hour away so we hangout to the nearest café. We chatted and talk a lot. Kyle said something to me ""Anna I know that it's only been months since we met but I wanna say something to you"", ""what is it Kyle?"" I asked ""I really really liked you Anna since I met you in the bon fire that night"" Kyle replied, I said ""I like you too Kyle"". Kyle was overwhelmed by the news, he hugged me so tight and I hugged him back.

One day Jessie came to our house checking me. I told her about my relationship with Kyle,  and she was glad that I already moved on with Kieth. We talked about Kyle the whole time she was at our house, it was really nice having a friend like Jessie.

On my date with Kyle, he mentioned that he loves playing dodgeball when he was a kid. I told him that I liked playing it too. We ordered our coffee to the same café we always go to. ""Kieth can you order me some iced caramel latté?"", ""What?!"" Kyle replied, ""I said Kyle can you get me some iced caramel latté?"" I replied immediate. Kyle didn't bother to ask about it and proceed to get our order. 

The day of my birthday came again, everyone was happy. I invited Kyle and introduced him to my parents as my boyfriend. My parents happily agreed to our relationship. Kyle and I go to our balcony and there we talked. I've decided that I will tell him about my past. I told him about it and the atmosphere between us suddenly change. ""Do you really love me?"" Kyle asked ""Yes of course"" I answered, ""Why?"" He asked again, and I answered "" Because you're Kyle"", ""Is that so?"" Kyle asked, ""Yes"" I answered, ""Or maybe you loved me because you still haven't move on about Kieth"" he shouted, ""W-wait it's not that-"" I replied nervously, ""Now I can see everything, at the times you miscalled me as Kyle, YOU STILL LOVE HIM DO YOU!!??"" Kyle shouted, I replied ""i-i don't know, YES!"" I only loved Kyle because I remember Kieth with his presence, everything it's because I see Kieth with Kyle. ""We're done"" Kyle said and leave. He left me in tears I don't know what to do, I called my best friend and she came over immediately. It was the worst day ever.

Now I focus on myself and I already moved on about Kieth and Kyle. With the help of my best friend Jessie I overcomes everything. I'm still looking for the one but I really keep my memories with Kieth, it was a very precious memory.

Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

I never imagined I'd be posting here, but I'm completely desperate. Three months ago, I made the worst mistake of my life, and now I'm watching helplessly as my marriage falls apart.

I was away on a business trip - just a standard three-day affair. First night, some coworkers and I went out for drinks. While we were at the bar, this guy started chatting me up. Nothing special about him really, but something about the attention felt good in the moment.

Here's the thing: my husband is AMAZING. He's attractive, fit, loving, supportive - literally everything I could want. He compliments me constantly, makes me coffee every morning, and has always been my rock. I had absolutely zero reason to stray.

But after way too many drinks, I did the unthinkable. I went back to this random guy's apartment and we had sex. It was awful - clumsy, unsatisfying drunk sex with someone who clearly couldn't care less if I enjoyed myself. The moment it was over, the full weight of what I'd done hit me like a truck.

I cut my trip short, claiming illness, and rushed home. As soon as I saw my husband, I confessed everything. I told him I'd answer any questions, do anything to make it right. He just stared at me for a long time, then said he needed to take a walk.

When he came back, all he asked was, ""Did you like it?"" I was completely honest - told him no, that it was terrible and nowhere near as good as he is. He just stood there looking at me with these empty eyes, said he needed to ""think,"" and left again.

He came home hours later, absolutely wasted. And that's been our life ever since.

My husband has completely transformed. He went from drinking maybe three times a month to getting blackout drunk EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. He's smoking again after quitting two years ago. He's stopped going to the gym entirely - used to go five times weekly. He barely eats. He's ghosting all our friends. His routine is now work, home, drink until he passes out on the couch or in our yard.

When I try talking to him, all I get are mumbles or one-word answers. We had our first marriage counseling session today, and he barely spoke despite the counselor's best efforts.

I've tried everything I can think of. Made his coffee every morning, told him how handsome he is, offered to run his errands. Nothing seems to matter to him anymore. It's like living with a shell of the man I married. I haven't seen him smile once in three months.

Two nights ago, he stumbled home from whatever bar he'd been at with a bloody nose and black eye. When I tried to help, he told me to ""fuck off"" and said I should ""go find that guy I cheated with so I can be happy.""

I tried explaining I've always been happy with him, but he shot back, ""Then why did you cheat?"" And the worst part? I don't have an answer. I've spent months analyzing it, and there's no reason. The guy wasn't better looking, nicer, fitter, more attentive - nothing. I had everything I wanted already.

That argument is the longest conversation we've had since my confession. I'm watching the man I love destroy himself, and it's all my fault. I'm terrified I've done irreparable damage.

So I'm asking, especially the men here - is there anything my husband might need that I'm not seeing? Is there any way back from this? Have I completely ruined our marriage? If your partner cheated, what could they have done to help you heal?

I love my husband more than anything, and watching him spiral like this is killing me.",1,1747410649.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

How can I constructively move forward?,"I’m big on trust and the truth. Without it, I don’t see the point of a friendship or personal relationship.

I have known this girl for 2 years and she has pretty regularly sent pictures of what she is up to a few times a week. Coffee, walk, trip, whatever. Great! I enjoy the notifications throughout my day. The regular communication has made a bond for me. I've helped her out financially too. She does voice a lot of verbal appreciation too. However, it’s become increasingly obvious that she is trying to give me a cropped image and doesn’t trust me enough to tell the truth. For me, the lack of trust, has started to interfere with my view of her. She is still a great person and I wish her the best. But the lack of trust and withholding the truth is a No for me.

I started to notice clues over a year ago that someone she was dating someone. Fantastic! When I tried to find out more she evaded the subject. That’s cool maybe she didn’t feel comfortable talking about it at an early stage. Totally understandable. Decided to give her more time.

The clues became stronger indicating a stronger relationship. She sent pictures of being in pretty romantic settings. Yet stated upfront she was traveling with family. I didn’t even ask, but it’s pretty obvious at this point she was on a romantic getaway.

In March, she went to Colorado with “her coworkers” for her birthday. She sends pictures with some pretty obvious clues that she is staying with a guy. She even posts pictures on her social media of her with the guy. I get the cropped photo yet all social media gets the full version. I was a little angry at the disrespect and stop talking to her for a bit.

I still enjoy the bond and start talking again. I tell her she can view me as a gay friend. And explicitly tell her that I want nothing but friendship as I am widowed. Did I get the truth from her side? Still nothing.

A couple weeks ago she goes to a concert and sends a message, and oddly, she names of only the girls she was with (I didn't ask, but okay). She posts pictures, for all social media, of her kissing the guy. Again, cropped images for me. She recently moved in with the guy too. But still hasn’t told me.

She is in a relationship. Fantastic. People have relationships and that’s a wonderful thing. Yet it feels like there is a lack of trust she has towards me by giving me a filtered image. The lack of trust has made me start seeing her in a different light.

At this point, I’m tired of hearing partial truths. I suspect the calculus she believes is that telling me she is in a relationship would mean stopping financial support. Why else withhold the truth? On the contrary, not telling me the truth will make me walk away. I would still support her, if she were honest.

I’m ready to either get the truth or end it.

Can I trust her in the future if she does tell me the truth? Would closure be a better option, even if I regret it in the future? I will probably have some regrets as there are many wonderful things about her. But it feels like I'm at a place emotionally where I need to make a choice between the truth or distance.",0,1747410628.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

Got off work at 5 pm last night and have been waiting ever since. This will be the first Prismatic product that I’ll get to buy and probably the last, and I’m excited. 

Our allocation is 12, and one guy brought his three kids that he is keeping out of school today to help him get the boxes. He’s been bragging about the dozens of boxes that he buys in the area and his trunk is filled with thousands of dollars worth of singles. He’s literally gotten everything in the area, and he defines it all by dollar amounts to the point that it’s hard to believe he actually cares about the cards themselves.

After sitting here for hours listening to him lecture me about how great the freaking Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are, he went and slept in his car while HIS KIDS kept watch almost all night. 

Early in the morning I went to get a coffee because my allergies were acting up and I was developing a headache, and when I got back not even fifteen minutes later he tried to tell me that I had lost my spot in line even though I left my chair by the door and my friend stayed behind. This was right after he let his kid take a bathroom trip that lasted almost the same time.

This is ridiculous. I love Pokemon, and I don’t want all this trouble to get one single box. This grown man is acting like these cards are life or death and it’s beyond a hobby, it’s an all encompassing obsession. This man has a reputation around the region, and I for one am ready for this nonsense to end. Why can’t we just rip a box or two here and there and just enjoy the experience? Why do a select handful of cutthroat thirty-plus year olds have to corner the entire Pokemon card market of the entire Southern Illinois region?

I’m not cut out to go to war with this guy on every release. Even this week I’m gonna work sixty hours and I’m lucky I got the opportunity to wait this box out.

The GameStop manager says the company is considering a one per person limit soon, and I sure hope it happens.

For my fellow Southern Illinoisans, hang in there. It really pains me that people like this suck the hobby dry for regular people. Unfortunately there’s a lot of people out there that need to get their act together before this stuff gets under control, but we’ll get there.",1,1747410607.0,PokemonTCG,3,1.0,False

Or if better laser repeaters get sold only in the pledge shop, its over.

Made it, now I need sleep.","I write. I also code. I like tools that let me break down novel writing into something manageable – outlines, structures, you get it. Got tired of juggling notes everywhere.

Checked out services like NovelCrafter, SudoWrite. They work. But the subscription model isn't for me. Plus, the idea of a service going dark and taking my work with it? No thanks.

So, I built my own thing over the last week. Non-stop. Coffee. More coffee. Probably a bad idea. It's called Plot Bunni 🐰.

Core thing: It runs in your browser, so it works on your computer, tablet, phone, even smart TV – anything with a decent web browser! **Local-only**. Your data is your data. No accounts, no cloud, unless you want to back up the export files yourself.

It’s built around a pretty standard workflow:

Outline: Arcs, then chapters, then scenes. The usual hierarchy.

Then you write the actual text for each scene.

*Import Outline*: This was a big one for me. If you have a basic text outline, you can dump it in, and it'll generate the arcs/chapters/scenes. Saves a ton of clicking ""add new item"" repeatedly. Should make starting a new project less of a slog.

Planning to add a ""discovery writing"" or ""pantsing"" mode later. If I recover from this sprint. (Yes, ""writing by the seat of your pants"" is the term, it's just hard to type right now).

**What it has:**

Plan Tab: Lets you see your novel's structure. Acts, chapters, scenes. Manage them there. Link elements if you're that organized. It’s an interface for planning.

https://preview.redd.it/6yrdiwngx51f1.png?width=1395&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e40eb04f729cdc7ea33c642d405009c15602ad3

Write Tab: Scene-by-scene writing. Markdown support because it's clean. There's an interactive outline to navigate.

https://preview.redd.it/e5r0m8kix51f1.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=11ede839b908e974c3d9b6a315ad49e48244bab4

**Customization:**

Full disclosure: a significant chunk of why this even exists is because I wanted something that didn't sear my eyeballs. I spent an almost embarrassing amount of time making sure you can change every color, pick themes, switch fonts, resize text. Probably more time on that initially than on some of the ""core"" features. It started as a personal project – I wanted it to look and feel a specific way for my own use. Then it got bigger, and I figured, well, maybe someone else will find this useful.

**Oh, right, AI stuff.**

This was kind of an afterthought, so it's the least polished part of the whole deal. You can conveniently ask it to give a synopsis for your scenes, help draft a novel outline, or even spit out full scene text, just press the magic wand button next to any of the text boxes. Honestly, I mostly use it like a rubber duck. Ask it for a suggestion, see what nonsense it comes up with, and if there's a nugget of something usable, I'll edit it.

For kicks, I also added a feature to let the AI ""write the entire novel"" for you, scene by scene, based on each scene description. Don't expect quality from this. Seriously, lol. It's more for a laugh or maybe to quickly prototype something truly bizarre. Go for a walk, come back, and see what chaotic mess it generated from your limited scene descriptions. It can be…entertaining.To keep things flexible and stick with the 'your data is your own' philosophy, the AI settings are primarily Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK). This means you can hook it up to your preferred API services like OpenRouter for access to more powerful models. If you're someone who likes to run things locally, you also can connect it to LMStudio or Koboldcpp...

Now, there *is* a default option enabled right out of the box, so you can play around with the AI features without any immediate setup. Full disclosure on this: it’s connected to a free AI endpoint that I’m running on my own potato PC, using a quantized Mistral Nemo model. I absolutely **do not keep or log any of the data you send to it – your prompts, text, nothing**. However, and this is important, you really shouldn't expect much in terms of quality from the potato. It’s there to give you a basic idea, but for any serious work or decent output, you’ll definitely want to connect your own key or local model. Think of it as the ""for experimentation and laughs only"" tier, especially for things like the ""write the entire novel"" feature.

You can also just chat with the AI to get help with brainstorming things.

So, here it is. It's **open source.**

Theres no downloadable version yet.  
Sorry about that I'm making an electron export soon!

# Could actually use some help, if anyone's inclined:

The AI prompts for the actual writing tasks (like generating an outline from a premise, or drafting scene text) are pretty mediocre. The results are… not great. If you're good at crafting prompts for LLMs, I'd love suggestions on how to refine them. The current ones are in the app's settings, you can just mess with them and change the text as you like.

Theme colors. I stared at color pickers for so long I think I'm colorblind now. If you come up with a theme preset that doesn't suck, please share the color codes.

I'm going to attempt to locate my bed. Let me know if you use it, what breaks. Or if the color options are decent. Or if you fix my AI prompts.

I also have a panic disorder but I choose to not get the Xanax even though it was offered to me by my doctor for personal reasons I just don't like those types of medications and don't want to become reliant on them. 4 days ago he realized he was going to run out and asked me to call my doctor about filling a Xanax prescription in my name so l can give it to him. I told him I don't feel comfortable doing that and I would think about it. The day after he asks me l end up in the emergency room for an asthma attack my inhaler wasn't working. They found nothing serious in the emergency room and I was discharged. The next day we fought a bunch and I became very stressed anxious and running on no sleep and no food. I have endometriosis and I am constantly battling that pain all this stress made this pain worse I began bleeding and I passed out at work so I went back to the ER straight from work myself. Due to all the constant stress I had a Dermoid cyst rupture and I was bleeding internally they had to preform emergency surgery. (This was yesterday early morning maybe 2am) he didn't offer to come he said he thought that I was breaking up with him because I went and didn't ask him to go. The next day I was released and my dad was dropped off to the hospital so he can drive me in my car back home. He didn't have a way to get home if he dropped me at my house right away so he took me back to his house to wait until I either felt I can drive or one of my brothers came home. My fiancé was angry about this and said I don't care about him and ran away to my dads after surgery because I want to ""break up"" when that just wasn't the case I had just had surgery and couldn't drive. He was texting me upset so I made the bad choice to drink some coffee and drive home still feeling groggy and in pain from surgery and anesthesia. When I get home he mad at me I explained I wasn't breaking up and I just had no real way to come straight home.
Later that day he continues to be upset saying ""why should I help you when you wouldn't help me"" referring to me not wanting to get him more Xanax in my name he continues to pick fights with me and it's starting to cause me a lot of physical pain from being in surgery and when I express that to him he tells me I'm being dramatic and I'm ""suddenly in pain"" because I ""didn't get my way"" and that I don't care about him and am only worried about myself he told me if I don't get the prescription I don't care and it's grounds to end the relationship. I tell him my body physically can't handle the fighting I haven't even eaten food in 2 days I can't get out of bed and he still continues. The next morning he goes again he said he packed a bag and is leaving to his parents because I don't care and I can't help him. I'm sitting there wimpering in pain asking him to talk to me and he's yelling saying I don't dictate what he does and I am only in pain because I'm trying to manipulate him.
Ijust had surgery 24hrs ago and all he can think about is himself and say that I don't care about him.

Newcrime/New Homosexuality

Can there be new crimes? New rebellious thoughts, new modes of piercing into a seemingly unending and unyielding steel body of Typhon? Buzzing swarms of camera-headed flies surround us, monitor our every step, catalogue our every word. We are subject to constantly evolving modes of categorization of our thoughts, beliefs, souls laid bare by questionnaires, the tentacles of the NSA combing and recording our Facebook profiles and text messages, sorting us into personality types, levels of threat to the god-state. It seems hopeless even to conceive of potential alternatives, let alone ways we could attack the serpent-headed monster. 

Is it reasonable to believe that this creature, the militarized body of capital that we call our government and state, would allow and provide for us the means to slay it? In fact, it seems beyond all reason to believe this. Why would a government that takes increasingly complex and invasive measures to ensure its continued existence, not to mention economic and military hegemony over the entire globe, would hand to us the weapon of its own destruction? Neither voting nor legitimate protest, nor the signing of petitions will ever lead to any meaningful reform of the state beyond the most surface level, not to speak of the undoing of its stranglehold on our livelihood and our very throats. The dead body of capital, an animated monster that stomps forward, slowly but surely, as if by love possessed¹, dominating our bodies, crushing our spirits, putting its grubby, mutant fingers over every new escape hole we dig.

But it is the mutant that will be our saving grace, mutant newcrimes, new bacterial grades of thinking, spores that fly from the crushed mushroom head of modernist logic and are carried by the wind to begin their birth in strange, dark new territories. New sex, new violence, new rock n’ roll. New drugs, new antilogic, new antilogos, new anticapital. The newcrime is the new art, the brand new brush stroke that signifies the end of the commodity form, the cunning, razor-sharp lightning bolt that strikes deep into the heart of the ophidian Typhon. 

What is modernist art? It is the commodity. Its purpose as aesthetic spectacle has left it useless for a day and age in which the web of capital can and has subsumed all art, visual, auditory or otherwise, under its wing; eaten it up and transformed it into nothing but a plate upon which is served the promotion of a new object or idea for the market. It is advertisement. It is quite impossible for any one of these songs, no matter the message or intent of the singer, to be inherently unable to be used to sell a car or skincare regimen. No modernist song is outside of reach of Typhon’s anguine, slippery grasp. One can sing, quite explicitly, about how the world is ending because capitalism refuses to stop destroying the planet, and this song will be used to repackage a coffee brand that uses child slavery in its chain of production as sustainable and eco-friendly because they donate 3 cents for every dollar spent to plant new trees (coffee trees that they will use to continue to make money of course, but that part is left out), provided that the artist consents to his song being leased for the advertisement. Then again, if he’s signed to a record label he may not even have rights to his own music. The point is not that every song will be used in the service of perpetuation of the capitalist system, but that every song could be used in such a way. That the structure of the song makes its content irrelevant for use by the beastly machine. 

Or, one can quite easily imagine a painting or digital artwork that is meant to represent the socialist fight, perhaps a drawing of a woman holding a watermelon to the sun to symbolize the Palestinian fight against genocide, being slightly altered and then taken by a clothing corporation as that summer’s new cloth bag design. There is nothing in the structure of the art that makes the content impossible to be mobilized in the service of the gnawing beast of the many-headed Chimera that consumes all that we do and see. 

New art is newcrimes and vice versa. It is electrified by the reason of antilogos and antilogic. The very structure of this art must be a crime in the face of the politico-economic matrix of capitalism, impossible to consume or commodify. One of the greatest crimes against the capitalist system is to make oneself or something outside of the realm of commodification. An image, digital or analogue, filled with symbols that avert and infect the eye of reason and acceptability, papered with lines of leftist theory, photos of penises, of grotesque sex, fetishes that offend nice sensibilities, words stricken from school textbooks. 

Art must be a crime.

The new art must be impossible to be commodified by its very structure. A NeoSymbolism carved out of jagged screenshots of men fucking and sucking cock, women fingering themselves and sucking on each other’s tits. Impossible to commodify. Lengthy lines from Antonio Negri, Gilles Deleuze, or Guy Debord superimposed over a man jerking off while licking his master’s feet with the words “Capitalism is slavery” stamped across the top of the piece. 

“The feeling of humiliation is nothing but the feeling of being an object. Once it has been understood as such, it becomes the basis for a combative lucidity for which the critique of the organization of life can not be separated from the immediate inception of the project of living differently. Construction can begin only on the foundation of individual despair and its supersession; the efforts made to disguise this despair and pass it off under another wrapper are enough to prove it.”²

Homosexuality. New homosexuality. They paint it over with a soft, white beige, saying, “They’re just like us”, “You’re just like us”, “Be just like us”. Roped into the same game as the straights, turned into sweet little marriages, one plays wife and another husband (but both breadwinners in order to survive in this day and age and contribute to the scaly, infectious growth of the economic Azathoth). As they commodify and homogenize homosexuality, they create a strange, misshapen outgrowth of heteronormativity- homonormativity. Gone are the days when gay liberation meant anti-capitalism, when alternative sexualities and identities were a threat to the Typhonic system. Homosexuality has become a nice rainbow of colors that advertisers can pick and choose from when creating the new color scheme for this summer’s product rollout- only for the month of July, naturally. 

It has become a simulacra of heterosexual identities and experiences. Not a different type of thing but a perverted copy of the original. Gay acceptance and normalization is simply the continuance of the war against the gays by other means. It uses the language of political correctness and acceptance to make gay others into gay “us-es”. We live out the straight American dream as a slightly different kind of consumer, marketed to with the earmark they have on file saying “this one’s a faggot, remind him gay cruise tickets are off 50%”. We’ve lost our credibility. 

“Homosexuality became a way of life. But this doesn’t mean that we should force ourselves to identify with this or that form of life. The problem is to try to resist the processes of normalization that assign us identities.”³

As a crime against the state, homosexuality held an inherent power, a death blow to the system that proscribed it. It held the potentiality to be a position from which to fight against the normalizing tendency of power implicit within capitalism. Gay liberation as a process of othering was a flow that deterritorialized the molar tendencies of capitalism. Gay liberation is dead, but the new homosexuality as a process of newcrime may be electrified, possessed by love, given a new weapon- that of a processual matrix of othering flows to strike against normalization, the bringing of sexuality into the fold of the commodity form.

Despite the colonization of alternative sexualities and identities by the ophidian system and its Shoggoths- college newspapers that write about nonbinary as one of new commodity identities, CIA ads that represent transgender people as having a place in their dungeon, the state crowning a gay spokesperson with a do-nothing job- homosexuality still holds a certain type of contrast within its molecular flows; the ones that haven’t been reified as part of molar institutions and identities, mutant, inchoate, polymorphous veins. These deterritorialized flows are in a position of machinogenesis, that is, the process of generating new (sexual-othering) machines outside of the segments of the state. Homosexuality and, especially, explicit images of homosexual sex, still hold much contrast-power; they are antilogical, impossible to be commodified. 

“The most ridiculous thing in the world no doubt, my dear Therese,” says Clement to me, “is to want to dispute about man’s tastes, to thwart them, blame or punish them, if they are not in conformity either with the laws of the country which we inhabit, or with social conventions. What! men will never understand that there is no kind of tastes, however odd, even however criminal one may suppose them to be, but depends on the sort of organisation which we have received from Nature? This being laid down, I ask, with what right will one man dare require of another man, either to reform his tastes, or model them after the social order? With what right even will the laws, which are merely formed for man’s happiness, attemp to punish him who can not correct himself, or who would succeed to do so only at the expense of that happiness which the laws should conserve for him?”⁴

Heterosexual sex images are easily commodified. They are everywhere. No one bats an eye at a naked body in advertisements, nobody cares when heterosexual sex is presented on the TV screen. But homosexual sex has a knife in its hand, and the more diversified and rhizomatic the flows the sharper the blade. A dominatrix on Law & Order pushing men around, no problem; but put a master and his same sex slave on the screen and people become uncomfortable. Men with fetishes for cars, women being milked, a man who puts ants inside his penis. Bizarre flows, impossible to be homogenizes, othered, New Homosexual assemblages. War against Typhon and the old gods. The New Homosexuality is a newcrime against the state, It is a mode of othering that resists molarization. 

Art is a crime and gay sex is the vehicle.

""To the ultimate periods,"" Roland answered;
""there is not a single extravagance in the world in which I have not indulged, not a crime I have not committed, and not one that my doctrines do not excuse or legitimate; unceasingly, I have found in evil a kind of attractiveness which always redounds to my lust’s advantage; crime ignites my appetites; the more frightful it is, the more it stimulates; in committing it, I enjoy the same sort of pleasure ordinary folk taste in naught but lubricity, and a hundred times I have discovered myself, while thinking of crime, while surrendering to it, or just after having executed it, in precisely the same state in which one is when confronted by a beautiful naked woman; it irritates my senses in the same way, and I have committed it in order to arouse myself as, when one is filled with impudicious designs, one approaches a beautiful object.""⁵

Tea is also up, but not much.  Perhaps the vendors are eating the cost.

Since I need my caffeine, I thought I would do the math.  I compared Stash loose English Breakfast tea from their website to a bag of Seattle's Best dark roast, which is the cheapest here in Washington State.  What I found is that Seattle's Best is $8.29/pound versus Stash's $40.60/pound.  Stash sells theirs by 100 grams and SB sells by the ounce, so I did the conversions.  For comparison to an non-tariffed brand, Kauai Coffee sells theirs for $10.08.  Winco recently jumped their per pound price by $2 after tariffs went into effect.  Perhaps there are also climate change issues as I've read.

I also compared both to caffeine pills for that morning jitter feeling.  The cost of one cup of Seattle's Best dark roast I figure to be 12¢.  A cup of coffee in theory contains 100 mg of caffeine.  Since a pill of Nutricost contains 200 mg of caffeine, half a pill equals a cup and will cost 2¢.  So the coffee costs 7.39 times half the pill.

Compare that to the Stash loose English Breakfast tea.  1 cup of coffee is about half a table spoon of grounds.  An egg-shaped metal tea steeper perhaps contains 2 tablespoons of tea and makes about 5 cups of tea in a tea pot.  Tea is said to have half the caffeine of coffee per cup, so 2 cups of coffee will approximate 5 cups of tea for caffeine.  But 1 caffeine pill contains the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee and so 5 cups of tea.  Stash states on their website that ""8 grams makes 3-4 cups.""  So, perhaps 12 grams make a pot of tea and so might equal 2 tablespoons of loose tea.  At 9¢ a gram that's $1.08 per cup of tea, which compared to 12¢ for a cup of coffee is 9 times the price of the cup of coffee and 66.51 times the price of half a caffeine pill.

1ko3xul,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ko3xul/aitah_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_dont_want_his/,AITAH for telling my boyfriend I don't want his friends using our extra bedroom like a love motel.,"For context my boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) have been together for 3 years and we've been living with each out for 2 and have known each other for 8. We dated in high school, but it didn't last long. 

  
I've had a lot of clashes with one of his friends, I'll call him Chop like the gta5 dog. Chop would always call me out of my name whenever we had any disagreements that built up into an argument. It got so bad to the point my bf promised me that he would not come over anymore. 

However, his other friends are rude, have no respect for our home or car, and they make my friends so uncomfortable. I literally had to tell them silence does not equal to consent. 

The cherry on top for me was when I told my bf I was going to hang out with one of my friends in the living and asked if he could help me roll up the rug in the living room. (because it was caked in dog fur and I'm allergic) After we finish doing that, I straighten it up and left to pick up my friend. On my way home another friend texts me and ask if she can still join the hang out session. I'm happy she changed her mind and say yea of course. When I get back home, I walk right into the living room and there were 2 girls I've never met and my bf with a few of his friends. (I say girls because they look like babies to me) My bf said his cousin invited them over, but he just left, and he'll be back. 

  
They took over the own living room. The coffee table was crowded with unnecessary clutter and the speaker was blasting some music I don't really fuck with so loud I couldn't even introduce myself to those girls if I wanted to. Though I didn't want to. 

I ask my boyfriend to come in the hallway and talk to me really quick. I can't to get him alone for a second cause his friends just keep popping up to just sit in the hallway with us and make slick comments.

I let him know that I'm frustrated that you didn't warn me that there'd be so many people here. At this point my other friend arrives. Then he has the audacity to say ""Well you didn't tell me she was coming"" 

I tell him ""The difference is at least you know her; you've known her for years!""

He insists he doesn't understand why it's such a big deal. I tell him I'm not trying to make it a big deal I just want him to communicate with me with people are coming over especially if I don't know them. 

This truly goes in one ear and out the other. I start getting irritated, so I tell him I don't want to hang out with these random girls, and I want them and his friends to go to the dining room or something. He says fine (with an attitude) and they leave to the hallway of the building. Which felt pretty obnoxious. 

  
Despite this his friends keep returning to the living room and invading my friends' space. 

Fast forward to 2am, I'm pretty fucked up and I ask my bf to take my friends home, and he agrees to. When we get home, I flop on the bed ready to pass out. That's when I remember I left my phone in the living room, and I need to charge it. When I get there, I see his friends laid out on the couches. I think it would've been nice to know they were spending the night. (They live so close to us, so it wasn't like they were stranded with no ride)

  
Fast Forward to the next morning. I got take a shower while I'm getting ready for work. I still felt a little tipsy and tired I didn't notice my dry towel was missing until I was done in the shower. I have to walk into my bedroom and grab a face towel to dry off. I get dressed and start looking for my dry towel.

I find it in our extra bedroom on the bed laid out. Mind this dry towel is almost always a little wet cause I use it to dry my hands after washing them.

So, one of his friends toke my semi wet dry towel to do some freak nasty shit! I'm pissed and I wake up my bf and tell him what his friend did. He doesn't care her just goes back to sleep. So I go to the living and ask them which one of them used my towel to do some freak nasty shit. One confesses to it and laughs. the only apology I got was (my bad)

Am I the asshole if I make a fuss? my bf always makes me feel bad for ""ruining his day"" when I just want to set boundaries. ",3,1747409870.0,AITAH,6,0.8,False

My aunt Lisa (she lives in Bend, Oregon—sweetest human alive) has struggled with her weight ever since I can remember. She's tried all the typical stuff—keto, intermittent fasting, even one of those expensive gym memberships that came with a ""free"" personal trainer who ghosted her after week two.

In late February, during a family Zoom call, she mentioned she was trying something new but didn't go into details. Fast forward to early May—we saw her in person at my cousin’s birthday cookout and were all like, “Wait. What??” She looked leaner, healthier, just… lighter, if that makes sense.

Turns out, the secret wasn’t some crash diet. It was Java Burn—a powder she started adding to her morning coffee.

[Java Burn Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/h7ybbergy51f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=426815eaa0e6d771d6607f83429df23139b07751)

At first I was like, ""C’mon, coffee powder? Really?"" But she explained it in her usual no-BS way: it’s tasteless, blends with your regular cup of coffee, and helps support metabolism. She didn’t change her entire diet or start running marathons. She just added Java Burn daily and tried to be a little more mindful of snacking.

She’s down 22 pounds in about 9 weeks, has more energy in the mornings, and her blood pressure (which was borderline high before) is back in the normal range.

She didn’t push it on anyone—just said it worked for her, and that’s what mattered.

Honestly, I love seeing her so confident again. She even signed up for a local walking group with her neighbor Bev. It’s kind of adorable.

# ""Mom,I want to call off the wedding.""

# On the eve of her wedding,Hazel Bell called her mother,who was thousands of miles away overseas.

# Her mother paused,stunned for a moment,but didn’t press her with questions;she knew her daughter all too well.

# With a calm and reassuring tone,she readily agreed,""Alright.I’m getting older anyway,and this business will end up in your hands sooner or later.The sooner you come,the sooner you can adjust.""

# Hazel responded with a light laugh,masking the ache in her chest.But her eyes betrayed her,drifting toward the bridal suite.

Through the dim light filtering from the window,she could make out the shadows of two entwined figures;one was her fiancé,and the other,her stepsister.

She fought desperately to keep her composure,but her voice betrayed her,trembling with the faint trace of a sob.

Her mother sighed softly,a weight of shared pain in her words.

""I thought he was different.I didn’t expect him to walk the same path as your father and me.It’s alright,Hazel.You’re still young.I’ll be here waiting for you.""

After a few quiet words,they ended the call.

Hazel crumbled onto the side of the road as the silence wrapped around her like a heavy blanket.The dam she had held back burst,and her sobs spilled into the quiet night.

The moonlight poured over her,its cold brilliance amplifying the ache in her heart.

Before tonight,she had clung to the belief that Ambrose was different.

They had grown up side by side,their bond unshaken,and their relationship officially sealed when they turned eighteen.

Ambrose Wright,born into a distinguished family of scholars,carried himself with effortless grace,his charm and refinement setting him apart.

As the heir to the Wright legacy,he exuded a maturity that set him apart from his peers.

In their ten years together,not once had they quarreled.Ambrose treated Hazel with tenderness and indulgence that bordered on devotion,as though he were the steady,protective older brother she could always rely on.

He showered her with gestures that spoke louder than words,lavish bouquets that filled entire car trunks,glittering jewels piled in velvet cases,and an unwavering willingness to grant her every wish.

To everyone who knew them,Ambrose’s quiet acts of devotion were proof of a love so profound it required no grand declarations.

They were the golden couple of their circle,envied and admired equally.

But that night,at what should have been the pinnacle of her happiness,Hazel’s ten-year dream came crashing down at their engagement party.

Ambrose had invited Hazel's stepsister,Scarlett Jones,the one person she wished to banish from her life forever.

The moment Scarlett appeared,memories Hazel had buried deep came rushing back like a relentless tide.

She remembered how Scarlett and her mother had tormented her endlessly,their cruel words and actions driving Hazel’s mother to the edge of despair.

She recalled the years of torment and humiliation she had suffered,the scars they left behind still aching like fresh wounds.

For once,Hazel,who was always calm and composed,let her emotions take over.

Her usually soft voice now carried a sharp edge as she demanded Scarlett leave.

But Scarlett,ever calculating,refused to back down.She invoked her mother’s name,a taunt that cut Hazel to the core.

Their heated exchange spiraled out of control,turning the engagement party into an utter spectacle of chaos.

Hazel instinctively turned to Ambrose for support,but his hand struck her cheek with a resounding slap before she could utter a word.

“Go home and sober up if you’re drunk.Stop making a scene!Look at yourself;how could you ever expect to be the future mistress of the family?”

His cold words stung far worse than the slap,but the pain didn’t end there.Her father,instead of defending her,added fuel to the fire.

“Your sister just returned,and this is how you treat her?Where’s your dignity as the elder sister?If your Aunt Althea takes offense at this,I won’t forgive you!”

The crowd stood silently,their eyes fixed on Hazel as the two men berated her mercilessly.Every word felt like a dagger,stripping away the last shred of her composure.

Then,as if to twist the knife deeper,Ambrose turned his back on her,escorting Scarlett away without a glance in her direction.

Left alone to endure the whispers and scorn of the onlookers,Hazel felt the humiliation seep into her very bones.Her face burned crimson,though whether from the alcohol or the unbearable shame,she couldn’t tell.

Without a word,she fled the engagement party,her footsteps echoing like a desperate escape into the night.

It was nearly impossible to hail a cab at this hour.After wandering through the deserted streets for over three hours,the cold wind gnawed at her skin and left her head pounding.Eventually,she stumbled her way back to Belmont Villa.

Chapter 2

As soon as she stepped onto the first floor,Hazel saw them in her bridal suite,locked in a tight embrace,whispering words that only lovers could share.

Her chest tightened,but she forced herself to turn on the surveillance camera,piecing together the scattered fragments to reveal the truth.

It turned out that while she had been blissfully unaware,Ambrose and Scarlett had shared a scandalous past.

Eight years ago,in a bid to shed the label of a privileged heir,Ambrose had ventured into entrepreneurship.But his ambitions crumbled,and he teetered on the edge of ruin.

At his lowest,he crossed paths with Scarlett in a rundown youth hostel.Within a month,Scarlett had replaced Hazel,his childhood sweetheart.She carved herself into the most pivotal role in Ambrose’s heart.

But because the Wright family would never accept a daughter-in-law from such humble beginnings,Ambrose settled for Hazel,all the while secretly cherishing Scarlett in his heart.

She believed their bond,built from childhood,was fate’s [design.In](http://design.In) truth,she was nothing more than a stand-in,chosen out of convenience.

Her feet,raw and bleeding,mirrored the shattered fragments of her heart.The imprint of his slap,like a searing brand of humiliation,destroyed decades of trust and devotion.

A resolute fire ignited within her;she would let go of the man she had clung to for over a decade.

But this wedding wasn’t just an event;it was her dream,a vision of love and promise she had nurtured for [years.It](http://years.It) had been her lifeline during her darkest days,the glimmer of hope that kept her moving forward.

She refused to let the wedding she had meticulously crafted become a prize for the very people who had betrayed her.

So,Hazel decided that this wedding would mark the final chapter of her decade-long [devotion.It](http://devotion.It) would be her last act of closure before severing ties with both her biased family and the unfaithful man she had once loved.

After pouring out her emotions,she took a deep breath,pulled out her phone,and booked a flight for seven days later.

The screen blinked as the purchase went through,but it quickly switched back to the surveillance footage.

Perhaps it was fate,or maybe just cruel irony,but Hazel caught the tail end of Ambrose’s confession from years past.

""I regret it,""he said,his voice heavy with regret.""When I was young and foolish,I mistook sand for pearls.If you’re willing to return,I’d call off this wedding for you.""

He sighed,his voice softening.""Even if you refuse,I’ll still treat Hazel kindly since she reminds me of you.""

Even though she had already made up her mind,even though she had seen the betrayal with her own eyes,hearing those words made Hazel’s heart quiver in a way she hadn’t expected.

Looking down at the screen,Hazel saw the love between them spill out as if it were too much to contain.

Scarlett seemed tipsy,her words slow and slurred,but she didn’t respond.Instead,she languidly sprawled across the sofa.

Ambrose,the same man who had scolded Hazel for drinking,now willingly cooked hangover soup for Scarlett,carefully feeding her spoonful by spoonful.

Scarlett turned her head away,a petulant kick directed at Ambrose.

""Who wants to marry you?""

Ambrose didn’t show any sign of anger.Instead,he reached for her foot,gently massaging it with a tenderness that made Hazel’s chest tighten.

Scarlett smiled contentedly.

""I know you can’t marry me because of your status.And I know you’ve never forgotten me.""

""This bridal suite is decorated just the way I like it.The wedding ring you chose is based on my preferences.Even the high heels she’s wearing...those were the ones I didn’t want.""

As she spoke,Scarlett rested her head gently against Ambrose’s chest.

""It doesn’t matter,""she murmured,her voice low and soothing.""I don’t care about [titles.As](http://titles.As) long as the person in your heart is always me,I’m satisfied.I will never leave you again.I’m willing to stay by your side in another capacity.""

Hazel’s grip tightened around her phone,her fingers trembling.

Her heart felt as if it were being torn apart,piece by piece.

The most painful part?Even though she had already uncovered the truth,a tiny flicker of hope still lingered in Hazel’s chest,a desperate hope that Ambrose would draw the line at the very last moment.

Chapter 3

In the next breath,Ambrose,who had been silent up until now,stepped forward.Without a word,he captured Scarlett in a lingering kiss,his lips pressing against hers with a passion that had been locked away for years.

Hazel couldn’t hold back anymore.Tremors wracked her body as tears streamed down her cheeks.

They had loved each other for ten years,yet every time Hazel had tried to kiss Ambrose,he turned away.Back then,she had convinced herself it was his shyness,his reserved nature.She never imagined that all his yearning,all the love he had buried deep inside,was meant for Scarlett.

They had shared countless nights together,yet Ambrose had kept a piece of himself untouched,reserved for the one he truly loved.

Hazel’s nails bit into her palms,the sharp sting almost suffocating.She cast her gaze downward,her eyes falling on the high heels that felt too tight,too heavy.

They were a gift from Ambrose for their engagement,sparkling crystal diamonds that caught the light like a thousand stars.The shoes were as expensive as they were beautiful,a fairytale dream brought to life.Hazel had fallen in love with them the moment she saw them.

But no matter how stunning they were,they were one size too small,and the pain from wearing them had left her feet bloodied and raw.

Without a second thought,she slipped them off and tossed them into the trash.

Shoes that didn’t fit,no matter how dazzling,weren’t worth keeping.

And a marriage that didn’t fit,no matter how much love it held,wasn’t worth salvaging.

Just as she reached for her phone to call a cab,Ambrose appeared behind her.His voice sliced through the air,calling her name.

Hazel turned,meeting his gaze.The moment their eyes locked,Ambrose released Scarlett’s hand,guilt flickering in his eyes as he noticed the bruise on Hazel’s face.

“You’re sober now?I didn’t mean to hurt you.I just wanted to snap you out of it before things went too far.”

Hazel glanced at Scarlett,and Ambrose quickly added,“It’s not what it looks like.Let me explain…”

“Don’t overthink it.Scarlett had too much to drink.It wasn’t safe for someone like her to walk home alone at night,so I brought her back here.She’s your sister,after all.It’s only natural for me to look out for her.Besides,she’s a considerate girl.She insisted on leaving early because she didn’t want you to misunderstand when you came back.”

Ambrose,usually a man of few words,suddenly became a fountain of excuses when it came to Scarlett.Every sentence seemed to be a defense,a justification for her actions.

Hazel stared at him,the man she had known for over twenty years,and felt as if a stranger stood before her.

They had grown up together,childhood sweethearts through and through.She had been by his side,supporting him through the grind of building his [career.How](http://career.How) had she ended up as nothing more than a placeholder?

The question lingered in her mind,but she didn’t want to seek an answer [anymore.In](http://anymore.In) seven days,she’d be gone.

She no longer had to endure it for the sake of""family harmony.""

Hazel’s eyes locked onto Scarlett,and the words she had kept buried for over a decade finally slipped free,tumbling from her lips like a long-held breath.

“She’s not my sister.She’s the daughter of a mistress,and now she’s a mistress herself!”

The words hit like a thunderclap,shaking the room.Scarlett didn’t flinch,but Ambrose’s face twisted in fury.

The word“mistress”seemed to strike a nerve,unraveling his calm facade.He surged toward Hazel,his voice a roar that shattered his usual composure.

“Hazel!What nonsense are you spouting?Apologize to Scarlett right now!”

“Fatherless,motherless,no wonder your parents couldn’t stand you.You’re a bitter,vile person,and no one will ever love you.You deserve this!”

For ten years,Ambrose had never raised his voice at Hazel.But for Scarlett,in the span of one day,he had shouted at her twice.

Every word he spat was like a blade cutting deep into the rawest parts of Hazel’s soul.

Chapter 4

Every word felt like a dagger,cutting deep and leaving scars that would never fully fade.

For a moment,Hazel thought she had misheard,her mind struggling to grasp the weight of what Ambrose had just said.

How could such cruel,venomous words come from his mouth?The man she had loved for so long.

She lifted her gaze,only to find Ambrose standing there,his body shielding Scarlett.

That familiar protective stance was too much to [bear.It](http://bear.It) mirrored the past,when Scarlett's mother,Althea,had risen to the role of mistress,pushing Gianna,Hazel's mother aside and subjecting Hazel to endless cruelty.Zaccheus,Hazel's father had turned a blind eye.

And each time,it was Ambrose,who lived next door,who rushed in to defend her.

He had always been the one to stand up for her,to demand justice,to pull her into his arms and offer comfort when the world seemed too harsh.

When Hazel doubted her worth,Ambrose would always be there,declaring,""Hazel,you're the best person in the world.If they don’t want you,I do!No matter what happens,I’ll always stand by your side and protect you.""

But years had passed,and those youthful promises had crumbled into nothing more than hollow echoes.

Now,Ambrose’s desire to protect was no longer aimed at Hazel but at Scarlett,the one who had caused her so much pain.

Hazel tried with all her strength to hold herself together,but tears spilled over,unstoppable.

Her heart was a raw,aching wound,and no words came to her to defend herself.

Seeing her like this,Ambrose's expression faltered,his guilt evident as his eyes avoided hers,instead landing on her bleeding feet.

""You're hurt?""

After all these years,Ambrose still couldn’t quite harden his heart against her.

He sighed softly,his words weighed down by regret.""Forget it.Let’s just say tonight was all nonsense...from being drunk.From now on—""

“There won’t be a‘from now on,’”Hazel interrupted her voice barely a whisper.

""What?""

Ambrose sensed something had shifted within her,something he hadn’t expected.

But with everything that had unfolded that night,Ambrose’s mind was consumed by thoughts of Scarlett,leaving him with no energy left to focus on Hazel.

Just as he was about to speak,Scarlett’s voice,shaking with sobs,pierced through the air.

""Sister,do you really hate me that much?Forcing me to go abroad wasn’t enough;you want to drive me to my death,too?Fine,I’ll die,so I don’t burden Brother Ambrose anymore!""

Her words hit like a thunderclap,and before Hazel could respond,Scarlett ran toward the road.

It was late,empty streets,no cars in sight,but the panic surged within Ambrose,and he threw aside all hesitation.He rushed after Scarlett,his only thought to reach her.

In his frenzy,he collided with Hazel,sending her crashing to the ground.The sharp gravel scraped against her bleeding skin,the sting of it almost too much to bear.

The blows to her body,the weight of everything,drained her completely.She couldn’t even summon the strength to cry.

Ten years of love,gone,[wasted.It](http://wasted.It) had always been one-sided.A childhood sweetheart could never compete with an unexpected love.

She couldn’t compete with the woman Ambrose had held in his heart all along.

After what felt like an eternity,Hazel struggled to her feet,dragging her injured leg as she limped back to her room.

Once inside,she tended to her bloodied feet,then,with one final glance,she threw away the carefully selected wedding decorations she had once hoped would mark the start of forever.

Her gaze fell on the wedding countdown hanging in the living room,and for a brief moment,she hesitated.

Then,with a resigned sigh,she ripped off the word“wedding”and,in her heart,silently replaced it with a countdown to her departure.

There was so much to pack.The hours blurred together as she worked through the night,only falling into a restless sleep at four in the morning.

Barely three hours later,the shrill ring of her phone pulled her from her dreams.

“Hazel,are you awake?I ordered your favorite soup.I won’t be back today.Let’s push the wedding photoshoot to another day.There’s an emergency at the company,and I really can’t leave.”

Hazel rubbed her aching temples,her voice hoarse as she replied,“Alright.”

Her quick agreement and perhaps the sadness she couldn’t hide seemed to make Ambrose uneasy.His tone softened as though he was uncertain of the distance growing between them.

Chapter 5

“Don’t dwell on what happened yesterday.I’ve already apologized to Scarlett on your behalf.”

“Okay.”

“Scarlett said weddings are just a show,nothing to stress about.Our bond is so strong that we don’t need these formalities to prove anything.Let’s keep it simple.”

“I’ll follow your lead.”

Hazel had already made her decision.This wedding would go down as the simplest one in history.

No wedding photos.No marriage certificate.No officiant.

And no bride.

After hanging up,Hazel stood up,her hand steady as she grabbed a marker and slashed“Wedding Photoshoot”off her calendar.

Ambrose’s work always consumed him,and Hazel had always been careful not to disturb him,especially when he was busy.While she’d been planning the wedding,she’d bought a special wish calendar,pouring her dreams into it.Each event was a marker of hopes she longed to fulfill,one last grand gesture for a once-in-a-lifetime occasion.

Now,those dreams were swallowed by thick,regret-laden strokes of ink,leaving nothing but a void of unspoken sorrow.

With a deep sigh,Hazel glanced around the room,the glaring red of wedding decorations mocking her every [move.It](http://move.It) had taken her the entire day to strip the room of its once carefully arranged decor.

By evening,however,Ambrose's name was everywhere.

“To win a smile from his beloved,the CEO spends 8 million on a vintage pearl brooch.”

The photo was grainy,but the woman beside Ambrose was assumed to be Hazel.

A bitter laugh escaped her [lips.So](http://lips.So),this was where all the money that was supposed to be for their wedding had ended up.

But it didn’t matter anymore.Hazel had long since shut the door on any sadness tied to Ambrose.

Over the next few days,he didn’t come home.Hazel didn’t ask where he was or make any arrangements for him as she once would have.Instead,she handed in her resignation,said her goodbyes to a few close colleagues,and quietly began telling her friends of her plans to leave the country.

Her friends exchanged knowing glances,their sighs blending in perfect unison.

""We had a feeling this was coming,""one of them murmured softly.

Without a word,one of them opened Ambrose's social media feed and handed the phone to Hazel.

""To the outside world,it might look like these pictures are of you,""she said gently,""but we all know it's Scarlett.""

Only then did the truth sink in.Ambrose had been with Scarlett this whole time.Though he rarely updated his social media,his posts had been flooding in,each one more frequent than the last,each one dedicated to her.

They visited amusement parks,tried on wedding dresses at bridal shops,and shared quiet moments under the moonlight atop a mountaintop.

Ambrose's love for Scarlett was as clear as day,laid out for the world to see.The only thing he’d done to hide it was block Hazel from seeing it all.

Her friends exchanged concerned glances,the silence stretching on too long.

""Hazel,are you alright?""one of them finally asked,her voice laced with worry.

""There’s no need to waste your tears on someone like him,""another chimed in.""Ambrose doesn’t deserve your love.Once he sees the truth about Scarlett,he’ll regret this for the rest of his life.""

Hazel offered a faint smile,her eyes drifting to the lively streets outside the window.

""It’s fine.I don’t care anymore.""Her voice was quieter,almost resigned.""But I do need a favor…""

In just a few days,she would leave this place,cutting ties with the past.She no longer had the luxury of drowning in heartbreak over Ambrose.

When Ambrose finally returned after days of silence,Hazel couldn’t muster a reaction.She remained distant,her indifference cutting through the tension.

Ambrose,for his part,was lost in his world.Even when he finally stepped inside,his eyes never left his phone,his fingers moving rapidly across the screen,oblivious to everything around him.

Chapter 6

Hazel sat quietly beside him,her laptop open as she transferred the surveillance footage onto a USB drive.She had a surprise in mind that would leave a mark before she walked away.

Halfway through the transfer,Ambrose suddenly looked up,his gaze scanning the house.""Why does it feel so empty in here all of a sudden?Didn’t you decorate?""

""You told me to keep things simple.""

Hazel wasn’t concerned.She knew Ambrose's eyes had long stopped seeing anything that didn’t involve Scarlett.

However,Ambrose’s gaze lingered on the countdown calendar in the living room this time.He let out a soft laugh.""Time flies,huh?Only seven days left until our wedding.""

Hazel stood up and walked over to the calendar.With a quick motion,she tore off two pages.

""Our wedding is in five days.""

The two pages she tore off had wishes written:“Ride a Ferris wheel together”and“Watch the stars together.”These were things Ambrose had already done with Scarlett.

A strange pang tugged at Ambrose’s heart,like a fleeting shadow of something important he’d missed.He opened his mouth to say more,but Hazel’s phone buzzed,cutting through the moment.

Noticing her mother’s name on the screen,Hazel excused herself and stepped onto the balcony to answer.

When she returned,Ambrose was already lost in his world,his eyes glued to his phone as he typed away,undoubtedly chatting with Scarlett.

“Who called?I thought I heard something about a visa,”he asked casually,barely looking up.

“Nothing important—just work,”Hazel replied,her tone light and dismissive.

Ambrose exhaled in relief.“Good.Don’t go planning any honeymoon trips.I won’t have the time.”

“I know,”she said softly.

Since Scarlett’s return,Ambrose couldn’t bear to be away from her,not even for a [moment.It](http://moment.It) was clear he had no time or space for anyone else.

They sat in strained silence,the tension in the room growing heavier with every passing second.Ambrose shifted uncomfortably,an inexplicable unease curling in the pit of his stomach.

Hazel had always carried herself with a quiet grace,a sensibility born not of choice but necessity.Unlike other girls,she never indulged in tantrums or petty whims.

But Ambrose knew the truth;her calm demeanor was a mask,a defense she had perfected over the years.

Beneath it all,Hazel was just a fragile,love-starved girl,yearning for affection she rarely received.

In the past,every time he stepped through the door,she would rush into his arms,her eyes alight with joy as she eagerly shared every detail of her day.

She would chatter endlessly,filling the silence with her stories,oblivious to whether he was listening or not.

Now,the quiet was [deafening.It](http://deafening.It) pressed down on him,feeling unnatural and wrong.Ambrose set his phone aside,his gaze shifting to Hazel.

“You’ve worked so hard preparing for the wedding.Once this is all over…”

But Hazel cut him off,her tone steady yet pointed.“Where’s your wedding ring?”

He froze,caught off guard by the sudden question.“I’m not sure…I must’ve lost it somewhere.”

The memory crept back into his mind [unbidden.It](http://unbidden.It) had been the night of their engagement.Scarlett had seen the ring and been upset.

He had slipped it off to calm her down,setting it aside without a second thought.

Ambrose opened his mouth to explain,guilt flickering in his eyes,but Hazel interrupted him almost dismissively.“If it’s lost,it’s lost.Just buy a new one.”

She didn’t linger on the [matter.In](http://matter.In) her heart,she knew the truth.Once she left,Ambrose would undoubtedly replace it with a stunning diamond ring for Scarlett.

This ring,their ring,had been destined for the trash heap from the moment Scarlett had stepped back into his life.Whether it was now or later didn’t make a difference.

Ambrose had grown used to Hazel’s endless understanding,her boundless patience that bordered on self-sacrifice.

Yet,for the first time,her indifference rattled [him.It](http://him.It) was as if he hadn’t just lost a ring but something intangible,something far more valuable.

The unease gnawed at him,relentless and unfamiliar.Determined to ease the weight pressing on his chest,Ambrose resolved to make things right with Hazel.

Chapter 7

“Since the office is quiet today,how about I take you out to choose a new ring?Something grander to reward you for all the effort you’ve put in these past days.”

Hazel frowned slightly,her instinctive response on the tip of her tongue.She was about to decline when his phone buzzed,its screen lighting up with a message.

Ambrose glanced at it without a second thought,his expression shifting subtly.He shot to his feet,already heading for the door.But halfway there,as if struck by a fleeting memory,he turned back.Leaning in,he pressed a kiss against her forehead.

“Sorry,love,I’ve been caught up with so much lately I haven’t had the chance to give you the time you deserve.I swear,I’ll make it up to you once this hectic stretch is behind us.I’ll make you the happiest woman alive.”

In the ten years they had been together,Ambrose had never spoken with such tenderness to Hazel.

He understood that women often craved sweet words,but Hazel had always been the exception.She was far too sensible,too independent,to need his coaxing.

Naturally,his efforts had always been reserved for Scarlett,the woman who thrived on attention,who could cry at the slightest slight and demand his comfort.

Yet now,guilt gnawed at him.The growing unease over his neglect of Hazel had prompted this sudden attempt to treat her better,hoping to ease the weight pressing on his conscience.

But Hazel gave him nothing in return,no smile,no frown.Her face was a blank slate,concealing any trace of emotion.

Once Ambrose left,Hazel walked to the bathroom,her footsteps steady but deliberate.Slowly,methodically,she washed her face,rinsing away every trace of Ambrose’s fleeting touch as if cleansing herself of his presence.

Belated love.Hollow compensation after betrayal.Hazel didn’t want any of it.

The days crept by,and soon,it was the eve of the wedding.The calendar had thinned to just two fragile pages,one hanging by a thread.Today’s wish read,“Have a family reunion dinner together.”

For over twenty years,Hazel had carried this hope silently in her heart.Yet,deep down,she knew it was a futile dream.Her mother would never forgive her father,just as she could never forgive Ambrose.

Refusing to linger on these thoughts,Hazel brushed on light makeup,slipped into her favorite white dress,and stepped out.She watched a movie alone,ordered a couple’s meal for one,and rode the Ferris wheel in solitary silence.

When the Ferris wheel reached its peak,the sun dipped low on the horizon.The golden hues of the sunset bathed the city she had known since childhood in a tender glow.A soft breeze kissed Hazel’s face as she stretched out her arms,feeling as though her memories were unraveling and scattering into the evening wind.

As night fell,Hazel bought herself an ice cream and left the amusement park.She sat on a nearby bench,savoring the cold sweetness while gazing up at the starry sky.

The stars above had always been her solace.On those countless nights when she was cast out of her home,it was a younger Ambrose who had held her hand,lying beside her on the grass as they stared up at the heavens.

But none of that mattered now.People came and went,but the stars never [faltered.No](http://faltered.No) matter where she went,those same shimmering lights would always follow her,unchanging and eternal.

After finishing her ice cream,Hazel stood and began walking home.The stars above twinkled softly as her phone buzzed with a message from Scarlett.

\[Dad’s sweet-and-sour fish is amazing!You’ve probably never had it,right?\]

Hazel opened the attached [video.It](http://video.It) captured a lively family dinner scene.Ambrose and Scarlett sat at the center of the table,surrounded by festive red decorations.Laughter echoed in the background as their families chatted about the upcoming wedding.

Scarlett’s petty provocation didn’t anger Hazel.She had endured countless jabs like this throughout her life.Instead,she found it absurd.

Wedding plans?Whose wedding were they truly planning?Hers or Scarlett’s?

Chapter 8

Hazel didn’t see the point in arguing with Scarlett.With a calm resolve,she deleted the message,blocked Scarlett’s number,and opened her chat with Ambrose.

Their last conversation was over a week old.

As she scrolled through the thread,a painful pattern emerged.Message after message filled the screen,and she sent each one.She had poured her heart into every word,sharing everything from her lofty dreams to the tiniest details of her meals.

Ambrose’s responses were scarce;his replies were a rarity.And when he did bother to respond,the topic was always the same:Scarlett.

Hazel suddenly lost the desire to text him back.

If her words were destined to drift into silence,why waste the effort?

She was tucking her phone back into her pocket when Ambrose’s name lit up the screen.He was calling.

“Where are you?Why aren’t you home?It’s late already.Why haven’t you come back yet?”His voice carried a mix of urgency and subtle reproach.

Tonight,he had turned down Scarlett’s invitation,a rare occurrence,and returned home early,intending to spend time with Hazel.But when he walked through the door,the one who always waited for him was nowhere to be found.

She hadn’t answered his calls or texts,and his worry had escalated to the point where he almost called the police.

Hazel glanced at the clock,feeling a knot tighten in her chest.

It was 8 PM.

Ambrose had always been one to stay out late,sometimes not returning until the early hours or,worse,disappearing for the night.

Every time,Hazel had waited in silence,leaving a light on for him.

And if he had been drinking,she would fight off sleep,rising to make him soup,hoping it would sober him up.

But what had Ambrose ever done for her?

Hazel couldn’t recall a single thing.Her patience thinned,and her tone became sharper.

“Can’t I have a life of my own?”

It was the first time she had ever dared to speak back to him.

There was a pause on the other end of the line before his voice softened.

“Hazel,I’ve missed you these past few days.”

“Tomorrow’s our wedding day.I was just worried something might happen to you.Don’t be upset.Wait for me,alright?I’m coming to get you now.”

Within minutes,Ambrose pulled up in his car,unexpectedly holding a bouquet of flowers in his hand.

She didn’t take the flowers.Instead,she opened the passenger door,greeted by a faint yet unmistakable scent.

A wave of nausea hit her,and she quickly grabbed a tissue to wipe her hands,choosing to climb into the back seat instead.

Ambrose,absorbed in replying to his messages,remained unaware of her discomfort.

He spoke absently,“Why’d you go to the amusement park?Have you finished with all the wedding preparations?”

“Pretty much.”

Tomorrow,she would finally leave this place behind.

Ambrose chuckled,his tone light.

“I remember you’ve always wanted to ride the Ferris wheel.When I get a chance,I’ll take you and make sure you have a wonderful day.I didn’t mean to interrupt your fun today,but my mom wants to see you.”

“It’s fine.We’ll have plenty of time for that later.”

Hazel had a lifetime of wishes,and there would always be time later to fulfill them.

After she left the country,she would tick off her list of wishes,one by one,none of them involving Ambrose.

Once Ambrose finished sending his messages,he started the car and casually played one of Scarlett’s favorite songs.

Hazel turned her gaze toward the streets,the city she had grown up in.

It was a beautiful place.

Neon lights flickered,blending seamlessly with the starlit sky in a dazzling dance of colors.

But the longer she stared,the more the wind stung her eyes,leaving them red and sore.

When they arrived at the old family house,the dining table was already piled with leftovers.

The housekeeper was clearing the dishes while the parents of both families chatted merrily.

Ambrose and Scarlett shared a laugh,their easy camaraderie filling the space.

In the midst of it all,Hazel felt like an outsider.

Her figure caught Ambrose’s eye for a fleeting moment.He saw the lonely silhouette,and his heart skipped a beat.

Suddenly,a forgotten promise resurfaced in Ambrose’s mind,one he had made years ago,vowing never to let this little girl feel sorrow again.

Chapter 9

After a brief pause,Ambrose summoned someone to bring over a few dresses.

“Hazel,”he said softly,“I know you’ve been busy lately,so I asked Scarlett to pick out a wedding dress for you.Take a look and see if any of them catch your eye.”

Scarlett’s voice rang out cheerfully as she leaned in close.

“Sis,I’m your bridesmaid,remember?We’ll be walking down the aisle together,and everyone will see just how stunning we both look!”

Her father,a picture of affection,ruffled Scarlett’s hair with a proud smile.

Ambrose,too,grinned at the father-daughter moment,clearly pleased.

But Hazel couldn’t tear her eyes away from the wedding dress in front of her.

The fabric had yellowed with age,the cheap material stretched thin,and a large tear marred the [chest.It](http://chest.It) stood out in stark contrast to Scarlett’s bridesmaid dress,elegantly designed with delicate lace and a fishtail cut that hugged her figure.If anyone looked like a bride,it was Scarlett.

Scarlett twirled with delight,her excitement evident in every spin.

“It’s gorgeous!If I had a crown,it would be perfect.”

Ambrose,never one to miss a beat,responded,“That’s easily arranged.Hazel has one,right?She’s the older sister;she wouldn’t mind handing it over.”

His gaze shifted to Hazel,but he paused as he caught sight of the wedding dress in her hands.

“How did this happen?”

Hazel’s eyes flicked toward Scarlett,and before she could speak,Ambrose stepped protectively in front of her.

“It must have been a mistake at the shop.It’s nothing to do with Scarlett.I’ll have someone fix it right away.”

Scarlett feigned concern,her voice sweet with a hint of mockery.

“But it’s so late now.The bridal shops must be closed...How about we borrow a second-hand dress for now?After all,didn’t you always say you wanted a simple wedding,Sis?”

All eyes turned to Hazel.

For two powerful families like theirs,finding a brand-new dress wouldn’t be an issue.But instead of going the extra mile,they seemed content to let Hazel compromise.After all,she’d always been the one to bear the brunt of their demands.

“It’s fine.I wouldn’t want to trouble anyone,”Hazel replied with a graceful smile.“You all have your own matters to attend to.I’ll handle it myself.”

Her smile swept through the room,effortlessly dissolving the tension.

The group returned to their chatter and coffee as if Hazel’s silent suffering hadn’t even been there.

Ambrose’s gaze lingered on her,his heart heavy with the knowledge of how much this wedding meant to her,yet his hands were tied.He feared the disappointment that might flicker in her eyes.

With a quiet sigh,he pulled out a bank card,handing it to her with a soft,reassuring tone.

“Don’t worry about the cost.Whatever makes you happy,that’s what matters.”

Hazel hesitated for a moment,the card feeling like an invisible barrier between them as she accepted it,her gratitude simple but final.

That soft“thank you”hung in the air,a silent line drawn between them.

Ambrose’s chest tightened,discomfort swirling inside him,but the words to bridge that gap refused to come.

Scarlett watched them closely for a moment,then,ever the opportunist,retrieved a camera from the bedroom.

“Why don’t we take a family photo now?Tomorrow will be so chaotic that the pictures might not come out right.”

Ambrose agreed without a second thought,drawing Hazel into the center,her presence a stark contrast to the storm brewing in his chest.

Just as the shutter clicked,Scarlett darted forward,stepping between them.

In the instant that Hazel lost her balance and tumbled to the floor,Ambrose’s heart lurched in panic.

“Hazel!”He cried,reaching out instinctively to catch her.

But Scarlett,ever the actress,burst into tears at that very moment.

Ambrose froze,just for a heartbeat.Three seconds of indecision.Then,with a swift motion,he turned to Scarlett.

He abandoned Hazel to crash against the sharp edge of the shelf,his hands gently pulling Scarlett into his arms,wiping away her feigned tears with a tenderness that sent a chill through Hazel’s veins.

Chapter 10

“Don’t cry.Your sister has always been understanding.She won’t blame you,”Ambrose reassured Scarlett.

The others quickly gathered around Scarlett,their voices a chorus of comforting words as they pointed to the photos in the camera,attempting to lighten her mood with half-hearted praise.

Meanwhile,Hazel struggled to push herself off the floor,her head throbbing with pain.A warm trickle slid down her face,and when she wiped it with a tissue,the smear of crimson on her fingers left her momentarily stunned.She couldn’t tell if it was tears or blood.

But no one noticed.Their attention remained fixed on Scarlett as if she were the only one who mattered.Their laughter and soft reassurances filled the room,drowning out the silent cry of Hazel’s pain.

It wasn’t until the bleeding on Hazel’s forehead had stopped that Ambrose finally approached her,the camera dangling loosely in his hands.

“The photo didn’t catch your face clearly,and Scarlett’s pose could’ve been better,”he said casually.Then,as if noticing her for the first time,his brows furrowed.“Wait…Hazel,what happened to your face?”

Her chest tightened at his words.Her face had been bleeding,yet their sole concern had been Scarlett’s pose in the photo.The realization struck her like a sharp blade,carving out the faint hope she’d held onto.

Hazel waved off the concern with a faint smile.“It’s nothing.Don’t bother retaking it.It’s late;I’ll head back now.”

What did it matter?The idea of a family photo had been erased from her heart long ago.

A place I can buy apartment decor. Thrift store recommendations?

Nice parks to relax in. I like to string up my hammock or lay a picnic blanket down and soak up some sun (ideally in a quieter location without a ton of kids running around).

Kayaking/swimming?

Coffee shops/bakeries. My guilty pleasure is focaccia. Do any bakeries make a good loaf of it?

1ko3p7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedbugs/comments/1ko3p7n/what_to_do_with_sport_gear/,What to do with sport gear?,"TL;DR; I found bed bugs and was wondering what to do with my sports gear. Was thinking of steamer or putting the gear in a bag then in the freezer. Any suggestion? 

  
Full story cause I felt like ranting:

So I just started my master program and moved into my student resdence this Sunday quite late. I basically checked the bed and matress for signs of bed bugs and didn't see anything. So I moved everything from my car to the residence and was so tired I basically passed out.  

Woke up monday with a bite of bed bug on my hand but thought it must have been a mosquito and forgot  about it. 

Now the appartement had this smell and so tuesday night I sprayed furnitures with generous amount of febreze. I then sprayed my bed with lavender floral water. Spoiler alert, turns out the corriander smell was not because of the previous tenants love of spice. The furniture of in interest in my room (if you're a bedbug) is the bed, couch, and office desk. I woke up wednesday morning with my arm itchy. I saw the famous row of bites and straight away realized what it was. I turn on the light and go to the washroom. I saw bites on my neck, chest, arms and feet. 

I then saw one bedbug climbing the shower wall, one dying in the tub. A baby climbing the bathroom wall. 

I then saw 1 dying on the couch, two dying under the office chair, and 2 just walking around in the room. 

So while waiting for the residence management to start their day, I start looking around the appartement. I found shed skin and black dots in the wall washroom, and some more around outlets. Looked again at the bed and mattress and couldn't find anything. The particular wall and outlet are all on the same side which makes me think they are coming from another unit. 

I let the management know wednesday morning while before the kind management lady even had time to make her coffee. They called the exterminator who is coming later today.   


Anyhow, school bag, my sport gears and suitcase were on the floor while all this are happening. They include: boxing gloves and knee pads for martial arts and some climbing gears. I am willing to get rid of the bag and the suitcase, but the gear is kinda pricey. 

Any suggestion on how to deal with my sports gear? I was thinking of getting a steamer. 

The residence is in Quebec, Canada. It seems according to Quebec law, the landlord is only responsible for extermination cost given that they react as soon as notified and the infestation was not out of hand? Can I just get them to compensate for the gear?

I am but a student and so my budget is limited.

Chapter 1

*“I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream.”*

*Sleeping Beauty*

Like all werewolf kids, the legend of the Moon God was one of my favorite bedtime stories. My mom would tuck me under the covers and tell me how thousands of years ago, the Moon God created the first werewolves. How, not long after, he made sure each werewolf was born with a soul mate.

I’d listen with wide eyes as she told me how the Moon God wasn’t just a deity for wolves to worship, but centuries ago, he even ruled over us like a king. Of course, that was before he was cursed into an eternal sleep, and werewolves were left to fend for themselves.

I could’ve listened to the legend of the Moon God night after night because that’s all it was to me – a legend. A bedtime story that shared the same space in my brain as Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.

And like all bedtime stories, I grew out of it. There was no time for bedtime stories when my pack got attacked and my parents were killed. Or when I was left in the care of my older brother, who was barely more than a child himself.

But then I turned into an adult and I learned something that wouldn’t just change my life, but the entire supernatural world.

The Moon God was no bedtime story.

He was real, and he was coming back to claim the world he’d once ruled over.

He was going to take back what belonged to him.

And that included me, his mate.

🌔🌕🌖

I couldn’t see his face, but I could feel him.

One of his tanned hands curled into my hair, the other fell to my waist. We stood under the light of a full moon, and I was suddenly very aware of how skimpy my clothing was. Just a thin white dress, and not even a pair of panties underneath.

“You’re mine, little wolf,” a dark, raspy voice spoke into my ear, and my breath caught when I felt his cool breath on my skin.

“No,” I managed to get out, “Not yours.”

“Yes,” he growled lowly, and I gasped when his lips touched my neck. His mouth set fire to everything he touched, and his grip on my hair suddenly tightened. “You are mine. My little wolf. I’m waiting for you.”

It was a wonder I hadn’t completely lost myself to the sensations of his skin against mine, but somehow, I still had enough common sense to ask, “Who are you? Where are you?”

His lips curved into a smirk against my neck. “You’ll know soon enough, little wolf…but you’re going to change the world. You’re going to change everything.”

That was the last thing I remembered before I shot up in bed, a cold sweat breaking out over my skin.

It was just a dream.

I wasn’t in the forest and I certainly wasn’t wearing some skimpy white dress – I was still clothed in my brother’s old t-shirt and fuzzy pajama bottoms. There was no mystery man in sight either.

*That was weird.*

*People occasionally have weird dreams about naked men touching them and claiming them, right?*

*Definitely nothing to worry about.*

I glanced outside my window, and cursed – the sun was already up.

*Shit.*

*I’m late, and Rae is going to kill me.*

There were only two things I was sure of in this world: first, that iced coffee was worth being a few minutes late for training, and second, Rae was going to kick my ass for being late to training.

Fortunately, I had a backup plan to prevent that second one – it was the caramel macchiato in my right hand, Rae’s favorite drink.

*Unfortunately*, as I speed-walked across the field and caught a glimpse of Rae’s murderous glare, I began to doubt the effectiveness of that plan.

“You’re late, Ollie,” she growled as I approached. Her face was twisted into a frown, her arms crossed over her chest. She was several inches taller than me, so I had to crane my head just to look up at her.

“Technically, I’m only ten minutes late,” I told her, “And I don’t think you can possibly be late for something that takes place before 8AM. Plus, I brought you a macchiato.” I presented the drink to her.

Rae’s dark eyes narrowed, but after a moment, she sighed and took the coffee from my hands. “You’re lucky you came with caffeine,” she grumbled, taking a large sip.

“Trust me, I know.”

Now that I’d soothed Rae’s morning rage with coffee, I turned to face the other pack warriors that had gathered for 7AM training.

Well, *warriors* was a strong word for the small group of teenagers and pre-teens that were sprawled across the field. Like me, most of them didn’t look happy to be awake before sunrise.

At twenty-one, Rae and I were the oldest ones here. The actual pack warriors, the ones who didn’t look like they were just starting high school, were in real battle. They’d gone to help one of our neighboring packs, the Storm Claws, fend off a dangerous group of rogues encroaching on Storm Claw territory.

Even our own Alpha had gone with them. We hadn’t seen or heard much from Alpha Roman or those pack warriors in weeks, and with each new day, their absence unsettled the pack more.

Alpha Roman had taken the best pack warriors with him, which left our own territory poorly guarded. He might as well have planted a giant sign on his way out that read: MY PACK IS VULNERABLE! INVADE US.

And we *were* vulnerable.

Besides me, Rae, and my older brother, Hudson, most of the wolves left behind were the elderly, new mothers, and their children.

*Not exactly the makings of your most intimidating army.*

With the warriors gone, Rae and I were in charge of teaching warrior training classes to the new wolves. The worst part of the gig wasn’t that I had to teach a bunch of grumpy teenagers – it was that Rae insisted everyone be on the field and ready to train by 7AM.

“Alright, everyone!” Rae shouted. “We’ll be focusing on hand-to-hand combat today, no wolf forms.” A couple of the kids groaned at that, but one of Rae’s fierce glares silenced them almost immediately.

“Pair up, guys,” I said, “Remember – no shifting and no claws. Keep it clean.”

Rae and I stood together and watched the students pair into partners. I was grateful for days like this – where I got to do the supervising instead of participating in the demonstrations where Rae usually kicked my ass.

As soon as they’d begun their practice fights, Rae asked lowly, “Has Hudson heard anything from Alpha Roman lately?”

Hudson was my brother as well as Alpha Roman’s Beta, and he’d stayed behind to run the pack in Alpha Roman’s absence.

I shook my head. “Nope. He’s just as much in the dark as we are.”

Rae sighed. “Ridiculous, it’s been more than three weeks since Alpha Roman left. He should’ve been back by now.”

“You’re telling me,” I scoffed, turning to Rae.

Even in the early hours, Rae looked just as put together as ever. Not an eye bag in sight and her umber skin only seemed to gleam in the morning light. She thrived on these early training sessions – even if they killed the rest of us.

I, on the other hand, looked like I could’ve rolled out of bed five minutes ago. My t-shirt and track pants did nothing to help my case, and I’d barely managed to wrangle my frizzy brown curls into a ponytail. Most days, my hair seemed to have a life of its own. It was a miracle if I could tame it, and today was not a miracle.

Rae didn’t share my same hair problems. For as long as I’d known her, she’d been shaving her head. The style suited her, and when I’d asked her why she shaved it, Rae had told me she didn’t want her hair getting in the way during battle.

*If only I could rock a shaved head.*

“Leah! Widen your stance!” Rae suddenly shouted at a scrawny girl trying to punch her opponent.

“What are you going to do when the regular training instructors come back?” I asked Rae.

She raised her eyebrows. “What do you mean?”

“I mean, you’ve got these kids throwing punches before dawn and shifting at will in seconds – no way they’re going to be able to compete with that.”

Rae rolled her eyes, but I could see the hint of a smile on her face. “Oh, please,” she said, “I’m not that good.”

“Are you kidding?” I scoffed, “You’re one of the best warriors in the pack – it’s no wonder why Alpha Roman was practically begging you to come with him.”

I wasn’t even exaggerating. I could hold my own if I needed to, but Rae really was one of the best fighters we had. She’d taken down seasoned pack warriors twice her size. Like me, she’d never been in a real battle, but I had no doubt she’d do just fine if she was.

“He only asked one time,” Rae said, “There was no begging involved. Not that I would have said yes even if he had begged. I’m not going to abandon you and Nana just because Alpha Roman wants me to get myself bloody in a dispute we shouldn’t even be part of.”

I couldn’t blame Rae for having strong feelings about Alpha Roman’s absence – most of the remaining pack members also had them.

“Jonathan!” Rae called out, targeting a lanky boy in the middle of the field. He stopped mid-attack, turning his attention to Rae. “There are other places you can try hitting an opponent other than the face. Like the stomach or the legs.”

“Or the throat,” I added, “Personally, I’m a big fan of the throat. Nobody expects it.”

Rae let out a breathy chuckle beside me, and Jonathan merely nodded at us with wide eyes. Most of the new wolves were terrified of Rae. She was terrifying – at least to anyone that wasn’t her best friend.

“When this class is over,” I told Rae, “I’m definitely taking a nap.”

“Actually…”

I narrowed my eyes at her. “Don’t tell me you signed us up to teach another class.”

I could see a sheepish smile form on Rae’s face, which was never good news. “Well, not a class exactly,” she said, “It’s just that I was talking with Hudson yesterday, and he said Luna Baila is sick, so there’s nobody to perform storytime for the kids today.”

“Rae, please tell me you didn’t volunteer us for this,” I groaned. I could already see the afternoon nap I’d been looking forward to slipping from my fingers.

*New plan: never let Rae and Hudson talk alone. Clearly, they’re coming up with terrible ideas together.*

“Look, there was nobody else to do it,” Rae replied, “And it’s only an hour! I’ve already gotten Luna Baila’s storybook. All we need to do is read it.”

“You mean I’ll read it while you get to sit in the back and play on your phone,” I corrected.

Rae looked at me, jutting out her lips into her signature puppy-dog face. “Please, Ollie. You’re my best friend.”

I stared at her for a moment and then I sighed.

“You’re lucky I love you.”

*Moon God, give me strength. I’ve got to spend my afternoon reading to a bunch of little kids hyped up on sugar.*",1,1747409183.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I thought about buying a hand towel rack and reusable bin and putting it next to the garbage so patients can put the resusable k cup in there and I'll take of them every few days. I'll do research into which kcup to buy, but trying to find ways to make it work. Over the last few months we have gotten completely away from plastic water bottles and just using refillable water bottles, mugs and stirrers, so just tackling the coffee.

this will be very long but if you have the time/patience, please read. it will be very much appreciated.

17F — looking for some advice/insight <3

in november 2024, i had what i thought was food poisoning, which had me incredibly anxious because i got food poisoning not that long before that. so at this point i was already extremely cautious about what i was eating. for about a month i could only allow myself to eat the same thing every day. 

around the end of november, i was in a hotel for a concert and at this point i was only eating leftover turkey and gravy from thanksgiving. at around 6 am after the concert, i was woken up with the most painful upper abdominal pain i have ever felt. i tried to go to the bathroom for a little bit because i thought it was indigestion, gas pain stuff like that. but nothing helped. i laid back down and eventually got myself to go back to sleep and i told my mom in the morning then just ignored what happened after that until it happened again but worse. 

this time it started in my back, so i didnt notice it as much, just assumed i slept wrong on my back or something. but then i laid down and felt it in my stomach too. so i went to the bathroom again, didnt help, so i woke my mom up and she gave me some tums and i felt like they helped but im not sure anymore. maybe it was just a coincidence.

a few weeks later, i was still trying to get back into eating food and this particular night i felt comfortable enough to eat some cake and guacamole with chips. shortly after eating it all, the same pain started. it started dull, in the center of my stomach. it built gradually and got to such an excruciating level. it was all across my upper abdomen and radiated to my back in the same area. this was the worst it had gotten so far. at this point i still thought it was gas pain because my boyfriend experiences something similar (ibs diagnosed) so i did things to help gas pain. i tried to stretch my torso out, walk around, stuff like that. nothing helped. at this point i am laying down writhing in pain. no position made it go away. i had to wake my mom up after about an hour and she made me some tea and rubbed my back and that seemed to help. 

the next time after that, i ate some pizza and fries. something i need to mention, i had been eating this pizza often because i considered it a safe food. immediately after eating, the pain started. i had gotten to a point where i could feel it starting and i immediately told my mom and she made me some tea. it helped a bit and then it went away.

after this attack, they started getting worse and longer. for example; it would start, go away for an hour, and then come back stronger. i had already visited my general doctor and she put me on acid reducers because she thought it was GERD. i didnt understand that part, but i took the acid reducers for about a month and i was still getting attacks. 

so at this point i was noticing zero triggers. if i ate, it would happen. if i didnt eat, it would happen. and specifically with food, i could be eating the same thing for a week straight, and it wouldnt trigger anything, but one time it would and it was so incredibly confusing. i’ve built a horrible relationship with food over the past 6 months. 

a few attacks happened between then and recently. currently, i had two attacks that lasted way longer than normal. 

i was visiting my dad for two days, and on the drive there i felt the pain starting. it was dull, didnt seem to be as bad as usual but maybe i was just distracted. i made some tea and it went away. he shared what he could relate to and he also thought it was gas. so i went about my day, spent my time with him, until the pain came back 10x worse. for context, i had eaten two eggo waffles that morning, which i had been eating often at that point. 

i had two heating pads on me because my dad is quite insensitive and said that “me being in pain is making him miserable” so i was desperately trying to get it to go away. nothing helped. i tried to just sleep it off, but the pain that i get makes it impossible to lay down. it feels like someone is wringing my torso out. so i couldnt sleep. i was texting my mom the whole night (bless her soul man) and she told me to go to the er. i had never been to the er so i was terrified of the idea but i gave in because i felt like i was dying. i woke my dad up, and he said he would take me home and my mom could take me. it was 7 in the morning on a saturday so absolutely no traffic. i got home and my mom suggested trying to get it to go away so we did what we could. 

i laid on her bed while she made me some tea, and while she was doing that, i laid in a certain position that made the pain just… disappear. so i didnt move. she got back and i told her to just let me sleep and i did. when i woke up it was over, zero pain, not even dullness. 

instead of going to the er, my mom scheduled an emergency appointment with a gastroenterologist.

my appointment came around, no attacks since the last one, and i told him all my symptoms and he said it was likely gallstones. 

important mention: gallstones are hereditary, my mom got her gallbladder removed almost two years ago.

he went off the information that they are hereditary and ordered an ultrasound. 

my day was great, we went out after the appointment and got coffee and went to barnes and noble and had fun. however, that night, i took a nap and woke up, had some soup and an m&m cookie i bought earlier in the day. the pain started. i immediately woke my mom up, and stayed in her room for a few hours. i ended up throwing up this time, but im not sure it was related. it could have just been a bad mix of food. i felt better after, but the pain was still there slightly. i went to sleep a couple hours later, woke up, went to make myself breakfast and the pain came back before i even ate. so i told my mom, and she said it was because i hadnt eaten. so i tried to eat but i couldnt. 

i don’t remember much of this day its a bit of a blur. but i do remember that the pain lasted all day into the night, so 24 hours at this point, that i caved and asked to go to the er. it was around midnight. i was blessed to have almost no wait time. they got me in, evaluated me, gave me some morphine and zofran and did a urine test and bloodwork. turns out im perfectly healthy and they saw nothing on the tests. 

we told them that we had a scheduled ultrasound and they brought in an ultrasound machine and checked my gallbladder. lo and behold, there was nothing there apparently. the doctor said it was a stomach ulcer. she put me on 40mg protonix. 

i went home and passed out from the morphine grogginess. when i woke up though, the pain was back. eating my life away. all day all night. i went back to the er because they had to have missed something. they did an xray and still saw nothing. they couldnt do any other tests because they couldnt admit me since im underage. (i think thats more frustrating than being a woman needing medical attention because no doctors with availability will see me.) they sent me home after some more morphine. i woke up the next morning still in pain, still persisting through the day. it hurt to breathe, eat, drink, move, sleep. i couldnt function. i was told to just sit through it. so i did. and it got slightly better every day over the course of a week. 

during this week, i had my full ultrasound done, and after a couple days my gastroenterologist got the results and asked to see us asap. that terrified me a bit, but we saw him and he told me i have a ton of small gallstones (thank you mount sinai for missing that) and a 5mm polyp. he said nothing about the polyp, but he said my gallstones were passing and that was the pain i was feeling. he said i needed it out asap. 

i have never had surgery, so i just started crying. i met with my surgeon after that, and he explained it all to me and it still doesnt make much sense to me because i dont get sharp or sudden pain. and its not in my upper right abdomen. 

he was able to calm me down about it and he said he would be able to do a single incision laparoscopic surgery. his name is david shin, NYU langone. i read his reviews and stuff and he says he’s an expert in single incision gallbladder removal, and someone said he did their surgery and they had almost no pain/discomfort after. so im not worried at all about recovery pain. 

what im wondering is, which one of these things is a misdiagnosis? do i have an ulcer or am i passing stones? none of it really makes much sense to me but im hoping theyre right about me passing stones. 

my surgery is scheduled for june 10th, and its about two hours from home. im scared about the drive back. 

i have to have the surgery either way, so can anyone also tell me how it was going under and waking up? and if anyone experienced digestive issues after, what was your diet like? im planning on following the diet my mom was on after her surgery because it worked well for her. it was mostly potatoes and broccoli and then she reintroduced chicken after a few weeks. 

im just a little confused on the two different things that doctors said it was. the hospital said stomach ulcer and the gastroenterologist said gallstones. 

im definitely leaning more towards gallstones now because for a couple days ive had dull pain in my upper right back, but its not nearly as bad as the attacks. it definitely worries me though. 

my surgery is 4 days before i was supposed to go to prom which sucks. has anyone had single incision gallbladder removal? if you did can you tell me what it was like?

thank you so much for reading this even though it’s incredibly long. advice will be very appreciated and similar experiences are also appreciated. if you’re experiencing similar things without a diagnosis, please get in with a gastroenterologist asap and things will get better. <3 


TLDR: i dont have much of a tldr, but for the past 6 months ive had excruciating upper abdominal pain attacks that radiate to my back. thought it was gas. no food seems to trigger it. it got bad and lasted days, went to the er. they said it was a stomach ulcer. my gastroenterologist got my ultrasound results and he said i have small gallstones and im passing them and thats where the pain is from. surgery on june 10th. was this a misdiagnosis or has anyone had a similar experience?",2,1747408810.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I am very curious about auto milk frothers. I am pretty new to the game, and I am pretty inconsistent when it comes to my milk frothing. I've wasted a lot of coffee/milk trying to dial in my steaming and art, so it would be nice to have an auto frother for when I don't have as much time in the morning or I'm trying to dial in latte art. The subminimal seems awesome, but the max it can make is like an 8oz drink, but I usually drink like a 12-16oz latte, so that was a bit of a turn off for me. Does anyone have something they love? 

  
Second, Daddy Lance recently rated my Breville Barista Express as a ""c"" due to the built-in grinder. Obviously, if Lance says its not good, then its not. So what grinder should I pair with it? Im thinking Baratza due to the price and easy user interface, but curious what other people like at that lower price range. Maybe something manual?  I was already starting to look for another grinder because dialing in suckssss with this one. 

  
And for those of you who will inevitably say to sell my Barista Express and get a Bambino Plus (for the frother), I would, but it's too late to return my Barista Express, and it sure wasn't cheap lol. On top of that, the Bambino Plus is only $49 cheaper than the Express, but it doesn't have a grinder. And the Express is a really really solid machine (aside from the grinder), especially for beginners in the sense that it does a lot of important shit automatically, and will remind you when you need to clean/descale, etc...",1,1747408596.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We're staying overnight so it'll be 4 hours on the way back the next day.

My son isnt bad in the car but we've never done a long journey like this before. He's EBF so we're expecting to pull over on the hard shoulder or services (I'm UK based) if he gets hungry.
We've also been told they need a break every 2 hours so we'll stop when we hit the two hour mark anyway.

We were planning to just maybe get a coffee, a change and feed and then be on our way again so not a long break.

I'm feeling anxious about how this may go. Its important we're there at the gathering.
I'm nervous he will cry due to discomfort or hunger and won't settle and we just have a screaming baby in the car for 4 hours.

But I feel like I'm not very good at self reflecting when it comes to stuff I create.
Are my ideas any good? Is my writing style too plain? Too simple? Boring? Or is it readable, maybe even enjoyable?

I’m sharing “Chapter 1” here – there will probably be changes. Also I am fluent in English, but not a native speaker and will use google translate to translate it and then editing it to my liking.
Right now, I feel torn: 
Does the world really need this? Hasn’t something like this already been written – and done better?

Context: The story is meant to be a mix of drama and romance.
I don’t plan for it to be super long, like a Game of Thrones book.

I might come off like I’m fishing for compliments and/or critique, I am just letting out my thoughts and as I said I’m pretty torn.
Just don’t take that part too serious, feel free to comment anything that comes to your mind, thank you for reading all that till now (and maybe even till the end of Part 1)


Chapter / Part 1



All three helped her cramp her boxes into Paola's van. No one dared to say anything.
She is Kennedy-Vivienne on official papers,
she is Kenny for her neighbours,
she is Dolly for friends and new acquaintances, 
and she is „causing only headaches“ for her father and her brothers.

Paola exchanged knowing glances with her best friend, no words were needed. Because yes, she already knew. She knew exactly what it felt like to sit at the table in agonising silence after a horrible argument had broken out in the family. And yes, it was always just as uncomfortable, if not unbearable, as you could imagine. Every single time. If you ever sat next to a friend arguing with their mom, you know how excruciatingly uncomfortable it is.
There was never a person to blame when they fought, it was just that they had drifted apart personality wise so much, that even an incorrectly placed spoon next to the sink could trigger the end of the world.
With every year, their personalities had grown stronger, more different, and offered more opportunities to be annoyed by each other.

Dolly‘s father and both brothers stood at the front door, ready to say goodbye. They pulled themselves together, and hugged each other to say goodbye. It felt strange, because these weren’t sincere hugs. They were forced, yet they knew it is the right thing to to, an unspoken rule.
Even her dark-curly-haired friend came to say goodbye with a hug. ""Take care of yourselves and..."" - a brief pause interrupted Dolly's father - ""if we can help with anything, don't hesitate to ask."" Mr. Winslow had brushed his hand through his graying, thinning hair. On closer inspection, it was clear: damn, he had gotten old.
Some obligatory well-wishes were exchanged, and then the girls got into the car, drove off without hesitation and headed into their new life.

As soon as they hit the road, Dolly could finally let loose, cry like there was no tomorrow, cry as if this goodbye was the last one. She was a total daddy's girl, always have been. Never had she thought the day would come where she would leave her family home. Thank God Dolly had her beloved friend Paola, who knew exactly how to handle this situation: no comforting, no talking, just turn up the music a little more and let her cry as dramatically as she needed to.

The drive was only 2.5 hours, and they were already in the beautiful old town of Stonefield.
 It had become the perfect example of a city mostly populated by students: overpriced but beautiful cafés, restaurants no one had asked for, supermarkets looking for part-time workers, bars and clubs that were intentionally not renovated because the dripping sweat from the ceiling gave it ""charm,"" and many other wonderful things you need to see.

Paola's ex-flatmate, Sasha, had moved into her own apartment, but had kindly come to help with Dolly move into the flat. Dolly and Paola had become friends through Sasha, and it was nice to see her again.

Almost all the boxes were in the apartment, the living room was chaotic but lively. Normally, the shared flat with its three liveable rooms would offer enough space for a third person, but they had decided to rather have another living room than another flatmate.
The first bottle of white wine had already been opened, the mood instantly lifted. ""So, where do you work now?"" asked Sasha, who had made herself comfortable on the dark green couch. ""I’m going to work at the Juli Café,"" Dolly swirled the sparkling wine in her glass, ""but not until the week after next, so I still have plenty of time to explore Stonefield.""

Sasha and Paola hadn’t been as lucky; there was no vacation for students yet. ""First, you're coming with us tomorrow to see the library,"" Paola grinned and then emptied her glass with a big gulp. ""Are you serious? What am I supposed to do there? Especially on a Saturday? Watch you quietly while you study?"" Sasha smiled and stepped in, ""That's nonsense, of course not, the library isn't strict at all, it's more of a hanging out spot. We’ll try to study, but you can sit with us, we’ll grab a coffee or something, and chat. Trust me, it’s really cool there, and then we can go into the town afterwards since it’s pretty much in the central of Stonefield.“
Sasha nodded eagerly, her sleek blonde hair barely bouncing as she moved her head.              

As the trio continued planning their day for tomorrow, Dolly compared her two friends.     They were two sides of the same coin, with Sasha being a bit more adventurous and Paola a bit wiser. That didn’t mean Sasha was more naïve or Paola stricter, just that they each had traits that Dolly sometimes lacked when she needed them at the right moment. Paola had tight, a little longer than shoulder-length black curls, beautiful Bambi eyes which are as dark as a night sky, and full lips she coloured with red lipstick. Sasha had silky straight light blonde hair, round blue eyes in a lapis lazuli hue, narrow lips but the most enticing wide grin.                     Instead of red lipstick, she wore a brownish-grayish eyeshadow. 

Two incredibly beautiful women: so alike, yet so different.

""The bottle is empty!"" a shocked whisper spread through the group – all three girls were outraged, baffled, shocked to their core. ""Rock, paper, scissors?"" asked Sasha. Paola raised her hand, ready to win, but Dolly replied, ""no need, I was going to head down to the kiosk anyway, I need a toothbrush for tomorrow. What are we drinking , and how much?""
The central council of alcoholic-beverage connoisseurs agreed on two bottles of dry white wine to end their night.
In her dusty leggings, chunky sneakers, colorful leg warmers, and a big hoodie, she headed out, two streets down, then a right turn to the kiosk.

The big neon sign flickered, one letter no longer lit up at all, but the refrigerators were stocked. If you didn’t look too closely at the dirty floor and the dusty shelves, it was a kinda cute  little kiosk. At least it served its purpose.
She grabbed the white wine, picked out an outrageously overpriced no-name toothbrush, and went to the counter. A man with long, naturally dark red hair, tied in a bun, and a full mustache stood behind the counter. He wore an old red vest, it was much worn out. You could almost still read the words ""Corner Kiosk SF."" The money they made from selling overpriced toothbrushes didn’t seem to go into the clothes for the employees.

Behind him, barely noticeable, sat another guy in the corner on a crate of empty bottles. He had messy, straight brown hair, dark brown (or gray?) eyes, decorated with dark shadows. The sleazy appearing employee had a cigarette behind his ear. He was sickly pale, even his red-haired colleague couldn’t compete with that.
""Hello, can I help you with anything?"" B. Pembelton was the name of the man who’s serving her, according to the faded name tag. ""No, thank you..."" ""ID, please!"" the seated one interrupted. Dolly thought he was just joking and smiled at him. She didn’t get a smile back. Mr. B.P. grinned, and his buddy – marked as ""D. Parker"", his tag was clearly handwritten, his vest way too big, threw an arm over his friend’s broad shoulders and leaned across the counter.

Dolly waited with a smirk to be rung up. ""What are we waiting for?"" said the lanky one with the cigarette, which he used to symbolically tap on the counter with the filter. ""Regulations."" Now Dolly was utterly annoyed. ""White wine is for 16 year olds and up."" ""How do I know you’re not 16?"" ""Are you fucking kidding me, I-..."" - „Madame, your ID, please."" His dark eyes showed no deeper emotion, maybe a certain satisfaction. It’s up to interpretation. But even tho he could’ve looked satisfied with himself, he didn’t even seem to enjoy embarrassing her. The thrill wasn’t there, no certain euphoria was painted in his pale face. Was he really doing this just because he wanted to follow the rules?

Reluctantly, she fished out her ID, slapped it on the counter, and tapped the birthdate. The red-haired guy nodded and started typing in the prices, and before Dolly had the chance to put her ID back, D. Parker had already grabbed it with his long fingers. They were veiny, covered in little cuts and small bruises. It almost surprised her that his nails didn’t have dirt under them.
""Hey! What are you doing now? Give it back!“ she stretched out her hand to take it back. ""Well, I have to check if everything is correct."" His gaze first fell on the photo, then on the young woman. ""Kennedy-Vivienne?"" He snorted with amusement. ""Did your parents think they were raising a rom-com protagonist? What was the other choice? Was it between Kennedy-Vivienne and Destiny-Sunshine?"" ""Shut up and give it back!"" She leaned far over the counter,              B. Pembelton barely managed to save the bottles. Parker kept her at a healthy distance by placing his palm on her forehead and pushing her away. ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" ""Parker, enough now,"" the cashier spoke as if such games were nothing new, he seemed to know that this behavior was normal for Parker. ""Yeah, yeah, mhm..."" He compared her with the photo. ""Good decision not to dye your hair red anymore, you looked like Christiane F. back then. Now you’re kinda cute.""

With her mouth gaping open and her eyebrows furrowed, she stared at him. ""Excuse me, but look at yourself, you look like..."" And again, she didn’t get to finish, because before she had the chance, Parker pressed the ID to her lips.
""Barney, I need to go to the storage room..."" He only briefly acknowledged Dolly again. ""We’re happy to serve you again, come back soon. Have a nice day."" He turned around and disappeared behind the cracked, broken door.

""You can file a complaint about him. It won't change anything, though. Nobody else wants to work here,"" Barney seemed just as blunt as Parker, he just had a nicer way to put it.    ""Thanks for the honesty, next time I’ll know to bring five more minutes and a lot more patience.""

A small smile and cash were exchanged, and then she disappeared as quickly as she could and hurried back to her new home.
When Dolly asked, Barney, the nearly 1.85-meter tall, no older than 27-year-old guy, was known to her friends, they don’t have much to say, other than that Paola though he was handsome and friendly, but they don’t remember knowing the other employee.
The evening slowly got late. They had decided to bring the mattresses and bedding into the living room for a little pajama party, to chat and eventually fall asleep slowly in a wine filled slumber.

1ko3bpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ko3bpz/am_i_overreacting_new_girlfriends_male_friend/,Am I Overreacting? New girlfriends male friend.,"So I've (31M)  just got into a new relationship with a girl (33F) we've been together now for about 2 months, see each other most evenings and usually end up spending the night, having know each other through work for just over a year. She usually tells me if she has plans or not if I ask what she's up to and wants to hang out.
Now, for context, she made it clear from the start she has male friends, I am cool with that as I have female friends that I'll chat to every now and then, but last night I asked what she was up to and her response was ""I'm just over with (let's call him G)"" 
Now ""G"" (37M) is someone that I know she talks to, but it's constant messages, with 3 x's on the end of messages, he recently went to Thailand and she went over to his house to help him pack, apparently.
During his time in Thailand, I'd taken her away for a romantic weekend, but she was still messaging him.
He came back from his holiday this weekend just past.
When I asked her what she was up to yesterday evening, she said she was at his house and had gone straight from work, we both finish work at 4:30 and would be there utill about 8:30pm, then she'd go home to bed.
She said they shared a takeaway, I know he gives her free vapes, and she said she usually sees him once a week at his house, about 45 minute drive from her home.

I tried to be cool with it, but now we are getting quite serious it's making me feel a little bit uncomfortable, am I Overreacting?

For context, I have just got out of a 7 year relationship, with someone I share a child with.
Me and this new girl planned on taking it slow, but we've both fallen quite hard.
I don't want to come across as controlling, as her independence is partly why I like her so much.
We spoke about it last night, we've both said communication is going to be important to both of us.

Some advice would be great. Like I said I don't want to be controlling, but I also know how guys think. I've said I don't mind her meeting him for a coffee, but I feel going to his house for hours is a bit much.

I’m a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I’m an introvert with a resting “why so serious?” face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).  

Here’s the deal: I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can’t stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I’m open to seeing where it goes—whether that’s a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.  

A bit about me:  

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and the new Carti album on loop. If you’re into music that hits the soul, we’ll get along.  
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I’m into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it’s my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.  
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.  
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we’re golden.  
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you’re into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who’s okay with my occasional shutdowns (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.  
- Bonus if you’re a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

I’m not here to rush into anything. Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you’re someone who’s kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let’s figure this life thing out together.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a “hi” if you’re feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. 😊

I want a week off work so I can just chill - basically have lots of great food (vegetarian) and love buffets, have nice coffee in good cafes, watch people, great place to sleep, walk a bit, take in some culture, but want to avoid noise, chaos, children running around. I am trying to get away from stress for a bit. Don't want isolation of course, but not too touristy or noisy. 

Looking for SEA as I don't have a high budget, and want good value so boys please share any spots, it could be hotels, resorts, cities, towns, places, anything would do to help think in the right way. I'm not a drinker or smoker - i dont know how to swim either nor am i into yoga. Anyway, I am not partial to water, or mountains, or anything so any ideas welcome.

I brought back some very nice light roasted specialty coffee from Brazil and I wanna brew my family a nice V60 to try. I have a Baratza Encore ESP at home, and I have a mediocre brandless hand grinder. Now I wonder: what's better?

Option 1: I grind at home with my Baratza and bring back ground coffee to brew at my family's place. The negative is that it'd take anywhere between 3-6 hours before I could get to brewing it.

Option 2: I grind fresh, with the worse grinder.

How much do these hours matter for my ground coffee? I usually grind and brew right away, so I honestly have no idea of how fast grinds get worse. Which option should I go for?

Is it my infernal tendency to emit crumbs that relegates me to this dark recess? Doomed to my solitude, I ponder if mobility might grant me fairness—perhaps a life of nomadic counter exploration. Toasters on wheels! Ah, what a radical world that would be, where I can choose to sizzle next to my soft banana-yellow friend and rub elbows with the flamboyant coffee press.

I (F22) drunkenly mentioned that I thought my friend’s friend (M23) was cute and I think she told him. Then last week, he texted me asking if I wanted to hang out sometime. I had honestly never thought of anything happening beyond me just drunkenly rambling to my friend, and this honestly made me happier than I thought. I had always thought he was cute but was too shy to ever say anything. 
We saw each other twice this week at a friends party, but each time it was really awkward. The first time, we barely talked because we were in a group setting and are both shy, but once we left he mentioned seeing each other at another party later that week and then doing something with just us later on in the week. He asked for my number and then I didn’t see him until the next party. 
At this party, we didn’t really talk a lot again, and a soccer game was on which sparked this other girl to talk to him about it a little. I tried, but I know nothing about that game. I’m terrible and shy in groups when I like someone there, and so I probably didn’t really make an impression beyond being shy. He and his friend got me food and as I was leaving we stopped to talk while I was waiting for my friend to get her stuff. I wasn’t even drunk but I blacked out from nervousness and I know we didn’t talk about hanging out again. I sent money for the food and sent one of those gamepigeon games and he responded by sending it back. I sent another back yesterday and still no response! He hasn’t even liked my Instagram post. 
I am just absolutely humiliated. I wish I never drunk rambled, I wish he never texted me, and I wish I never went to those parties and probably came across as the most boring person alive and made him change his mind about us hanging out. I wasn’t expecting this to hurt so badly, but I guess having the unexpected happiness of him asking me out got me excited and I thought our first time meeting afterwards would be alone and not in a room with a bunch of his friends and mine. I just wish I could have redemption or he would reply, but I genuinely think he changed his mind. I feel like the first person to ever have a date offer rescinded before it happens. I’m not even sure if I’ll ever see him in a group again, because what if he tells his friends how boring he was or how he changed his mind about me and I never get invited. This is just an absolute disaster and I wish I could reverse time and prevent this from happening. I have even thought about texting in a few days like “i’m thinking of checking out this coffee place, wanna come?” But at this point I’ve been so boring and have texted first so it’s like getting to a point of being needy.
I have been really hard on myself and feel like I was So close to just one hangout and now that possibility has been ripped from me and won’t ever happen to me. I also haven’t really liked someone since my ex and that feeling was kind of nice but oh well.",6,1747407966.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I’ve recently started my daily dosage of Vyvanse 30MG. 29/Male, 6’4 around 207Lbs.

My first day was pretty awesome, new feeling and all, but the second day I had an intense come up that lasted about 1 hour which occurred maybe 2 hours after taking the dose. This was followed by only about 2-3 hours of slightly enhanced focus and an overall crash around 2PM.

My typical diet is 2 cups of black coffee in the morning. Nothing but water until 11AM where I usually eat some type of sandwich.

Today I decided to avoid caffeine, and I’ve noticed that I skipped the intensity and gradually came to a noticeable focus/calmness around 2 hours after taking the medication.

With that said, I have 2 questions:

- Could it be that the caffeine in my coffee yesterday was responsible for such an intense onset? Intensity being extreme focus and euphoria - something that I’d like to avoid.
- Does acidity really play that big of a role in diminishing the longevity of my dose for the day?

Thoughts? Changes? I’m not a huge breakfast person but I’m willing to adjust my diet if it means I’m affording my medication the means to work as intended.

Thank you all.

July is already knocking on our door, bringing with it the sweet sizzle of summer days and the undeniable buzz of the Fourth of July. Feels like just yesterday we were bundled up, right? Now, the aroma of sunscreen is in the air, and our minds are wandering to barbecues, fireworks lighting up the night, and maybe, just maybe, a little escape from the everyday hustle. But wait, you haven't planned a thing yet? The calendar flipped, and suddenly it's less than a week away? Don't you fret one bit! We've all been there. Life gets busy, distractions abound, and suddenly that perfect, picturesque patriotic getaway you envisioned seems a million miles away. You might be thinking the best spots are booked solid, prices are through the roof, and you're doomed to a backyard grill session (which, hey, isn't so bad, but you were hankering for something more). Well, hold onto your sparklers, buttercup, because you'd be surprised. Even at this eleventh hour, there are still some fantastic last minute July 4 getaways just waiting for you to discover. It just takes a little savvy, a dash of flexibility, and a willingness to embrace the spontaneous side of travel. Let's dive in and see what kind of red, white, and blue adventures we can rustle up for you!

The Eleventh-Hour Eagle: Snagging Last Minute July 4 Getaways
-------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so you've dropped the ball a little planning-wise. Happens to the best of us, trust me. The thought of a perfectly orchestrated Fourth of July trip has gone out the window, and you're now staring down the barrel of ""what am I going to do?"" But before you resign yourself to Netflix and lukewarm hot dogs, consider this: spontaneity can be *incredibly* rewarding. Think of it like finding a hidden gem in a cluttered attic – sometimes the best treasures are discovered when you're not even looking for them. When it comes to last minute July 4 getaways, your biggest assets are flexibility and a willingness to think outside the box. Forget the packed beaches and overcrowded city centers everyone else booked months ago. We're talking about finding those unexpected pockets of patriotic fun, those quieter corners where the fireworks display is just as spectacular, and the feeling of freedom is just as potent. It's about embracing the adventure of the unknown and trusting that a little last-minute scrambling can lead to some truly unforgettable experiences.

### Navigating the Late-Game Landscape: Your Game Plan for Finding Availability

So, where do you even begin when the clock is ticking? It can feel overwhelming, like trying to paddle a tiny raft through a sea of ""fully booked."" But fear not, intrepid traveler! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to become a master of the last-minute search. Forget the traditional booking methods that require months of foresight. We're about to enter the world of dynamic pricing, cancellation alerts, and casting a wide net. This isn't about finding the *absolute* cheapest deal (though we'll touch on that later), it's about finding *anything* that fits your criteria and is still available. Think of it as a treasure hunt, with the prize being a fabulous Fourth of July getaway.

- **Be Flexible on Destination:** This is probably the most crucial piece of advice. If your heart was set on a specific, super popular spot, you might need to adjust your expectations. Open up your search to nearby towns, less-hyped regions, or destinations that might not be the *first* place people think of for the Fourth. You might be surprised by the charm and festivities these places offer.
- **Consider Mid-Week Travel:** Can you swing leaving a day or two before the actual holiday, or staying a day after? This can sometimes open up more availability and, in some cases, slightly better prices. People often book Thursday-Sunday or Friday-Monday for the holiday weekend, leaving Tuesday/Wednesday or Monday/Tuesday with potential openings.
- **Look Beyond Traditional Hotels:** Think outside the hotel box! Explore options like vacation rentals (Airbnb, VRBO), bed and breakfasts, or even camping if that's your jam. Often, individual owners have less rigid booking policies and may have late cancellations or openings that larger hotel chains don't. Plus, a cozy B&amp;B or unique rental can add a whole other layer of charm to your spontaneous trip. ""Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/""
- **Utilize Last-Minute Booking Sites and Apps:** Several websites and apps specialize in finding last-minute deals. These platforms aggregate availability and can often snag you a better price than booking directly, especially in the days leading up to a major holiday. Set up alerts for destinations you're interested in and be ready to pull the trigger when you see something you like.
- **Call Directly:** Sometimes, the old-fashioned way is the best. If you find a place you're interested in online but it shows no availability, give them a call. Sometimes, they might have a hold on a room that's about to expire, a recent cancellation they haven't updated online yet, or they might be able to put you on a waitlist in case of a last-minute no-show. It's a long shot, but definitely worth a try!

Coasting into Celebration: Last Minute Beach Getaways for the Fourth
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ah, the beach. The rhythmic crash of waves, the salty air, the feeling of sand between your toes – it's a quintessential summer escape. And for the Fourth of July, a beach getaway offers a double dose of freedom: the independence of the nation and the liberation from your daily grind. You might think getting a last minute beach spot is impossible, but hold your horses! While the most famous, postcard-perfect beaches might be a no-go, there are countless coastal gems that offer a fantastic Fourth of July experience without the crushing crowds.

Think about the less-hyped beach towns or the slightly more remote stretches of coastline. These places often have just as much charm, if not more, and their Fourth of July celebrations can feel more authentic and community-driven. Imagine sinking your toes into the sand, the ocean breeze carrying the scent of grilled burgers, and waiting for the fireworks to explode over the water. It's a classic for a reason, and with a little digging, you can still make it happen.

### Sandy Shores and Sparklers: Finding Your Coastal Haven

So, where do you look when the clock is ticking for a beach escape? As we discussed, flexibility is key. Forget the big names for a moment and broaden your horizons along the coastline. Think about the smaller towns nestled near larger beach destinations – they often have more availability and can be more affordable. Also, consider the northern or southern reaches of popular coastlines; sometimes, being just a bit further out can make a huge difference in availability.

Here are a few ideas to jumpstart your last-minute beach search:

- **Explore the Forgotten Coasts:** Every state with a coastline has popular spots, but they also have lesser-known areas that are equally beautiful. Do a little research on smaller towns along the coast. These spots often have charming downtowns, local restaurants, and fireworks displays that are just as impressive as those in bigger cities.
- **Consider Lakes and Rivers with Beaches:** Who says a beach has to be on the ocean? Many lakes and rivers across the country have beautiful sandy shores and vibrant Fourth of July celebrations. These can be a fantastic alternative, often with less crowds and equally stunning water views for fireworks.
- **Look for Campground Availability Near the Water:** If you're feeling adventurous and the weather's looking good, camping near the beach can be a great last-minute option. Federal and state parks often have campgrounds, and while reserved spots might be gone, they sometimes have first-come, first-served sites or last-minute cancellations.
- **Utilize Vacation Rental Filters:** When searching on platforms like Airbnb or VRBO, utilize the filters for ""beachfront"" or ""within walking distance of the beach."" You can also filter by cancellation policies, focusing on those with flexible options in case your plans change.

Mountain Majesty and Mid-America Merriment: Alternative Last Minute July 4 Getaways
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe sand isn't your thing, or the thought of crowds at the beach on a holiday weekend gives you hives. No worries! The beauty of the United States is its incredible diversity of landscapes and experiences  
. The Fourth of July isn't just about the coast. Inland destinations offer a wealth of patriotic fun, from charming small towns with old-fashioned parades to rugged mountains offering breathtaking views of fireworks displays. Thinking outside the beach box can open up a whole new world of last-minute possibilities, often in places you might not have initially considered. This is where the real adventure of a spontaneous trip can shine through – discovering hidden gems and experiencing the holiday in a totally unique way.

### Beyond the Boardwalk: Discovering Inland Independence Day Celebrations

So, if not the beach, then where? The possibilities are endless, truly! Think about regions known for their natural beauty, historical significance, or vibrant community spirit. Forging a last minute July 4 getaway away from the typical coastal crush can lead to some seriously memorable experiences.

Here are some ideas for alternative Independence Day escapes:

- **Head to the Mountains:** The mountains in July are absolutely stunning. Think cool crisp air, hiking trails with panoramic views, and charming mountain towns with their own unique Fourth of July traditions. Imagine watching a fireworks display from a mountainside overlooking a valley – pretty epic, right? Look into destinations in the Rockies, the Appalachians, the Sierra Nevadas, or even smaller mountain ranges closer to home.
- **Explore Historic Small Towns:** Many small towns across the country have incredibly heartwarming and authentic Fourth of July celebrations. Think classic parades with marching bands and decorated floats, community picnics, and fireworks launched from the town square or a local park. These towns often have charming B&amp;Bs or local inns that might have last-minute availability. Research towns known for their historical significance or those located near national parks or other attractions.
- **Consider National or State Parks:** If you're a nature lover, spending the Fourth of July in a national or state park can be an incredible experience. Many parks have special programs and events for the holiday, and the natural beauty provides a stunning backdrop for fireworks. While camping reservations might be tough to snag last minute, look for lodges or cabins within or near the park boundaries, or explore campgrounds that might have first-come, first-served sites.
- **Visit a Lakeside Town (Not Necessarily Coastal!):** Just like coastal towns, lakeside towns can have fantastic Fourth of July celebrations. Think boating, swimming, lakeside barbecues, and fireworks reflecting on the water. These destinations are often less crowded than ocean beaches and can offer a different kind of relaxed holiday vibe.

Budget-Savvy Stays: Finding Affordable Last Minute July 4 Getaways
------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's be real: holidays can be expensive, and planning last minute can sometimes feel like you're destined to pay a premium. But just because you're short on time doesn't mean you have to break the bank. Finding affordable last minute July 4 getaways is still possible, it just requires a little ingenuity and a willingness to prioritize. It's not about finding the *cheapest* possible place, necessarily, but about finding a good value for your budget and ensuring you can still enjoy the festivities without the post-holiday financial hangover.

Think about where you can cut costs without sacrificing the fun. Can you pack a cooler instead of eating out every meal? Are there free community events you can enjoy? Remember, the most important part of a Fourth of July getaway is the experience itself, the feeling of celebrating independence, not how much money you spend on a fancy hotel room.

### Pinching Pennies and Lighting Sparklers: Tips for a Budget-Friendly Fourth

Okay, so how do you make sure your last-minute spontaneity doesn't send your bank account whimpering? It’s all about smart choices and being creative with your resources. Here are some pointers for finding affordable last minute July 4 getaways:

1. **Be Flexible with Accommodation Type:** As mentioned before, look beyond traditional hotels. Hostels, guesthouses, or even renting a room in someone's home can be significantly cheaper than a hotel room, especially on short notice.
2. **Utilize Discount Travel Sites and Apps:** Keep an eye on sites and apps that specialize in last-minute deals. They often have flash sales or discounted rates that pop up closer to the travel date.
3. **Consider Staying Slightly Outside the Main Hub:** If you're set on a particular city or destination, look for accommodation in surrounding towns or suburbs. You might save a good amount of money by being willing to drive a little bit to get to the main attractions or fireworks displays.
4. **Focus on Free Activities:** The Fourth of July is full of fantastic free activities! Parades, fireworks displays, public parks, community festivals – these are all great ways to celebrate without spending a dime. Research the free events happening in your chosen destination.
5. **Pack Snacks and Drinks:** Eating out for every meal can add up quickly. Pack a cooler with snacks, drinks, and even some ingredients for simple meals. This can save you a considerable amount of money, especially if you're traveling with family.
6. **Look for Package Deals (with Caution):** Sometimes, travel websites offer package deals that include flights and accommodation. While these *can* be good value, especially with last-minute availability, always compare the price to booking each element separately to make sure you're actually saving money.
7. **Consider Camping or Glamping:** If you're an outdoorsy type, camping or glamping (a more glamorous form of camping) can be a very affordable way to spend the Fourth of July, especially if you already own camping gear. Many campgrounds offer firework views and a great sense of community.

The Art of the Quick Escape: Packing for Last Minute July 4 Getaways
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, you've found your last minute July 4 getaway – pat yourself on the back! Now comes the slightly frantic part: packing. When you’re heading out on a spontaneous trip, overthinking your packing can lead to stress and forgetting essential items. The key here is to be efficient, versatile, and only pack what you truly need. Remember, you're going away for a holiday, not moving across the country! Think about the activities you plan to do and the weather forecast, and pack accordingly.

Don't get bogged down in ""what ifs."" Focus on the essentials and items that can serve multiple purposes. A well-packed bag for a last-minute getaway should feel light and manageable, not like you’re lugging around a suitcase filled with lead.

### Lightening Your Load: What to Pack for a Spontaneous Fourth

Packing for a spontaneous getaway requires a different mindset than meticulously planning every outfit a month in advance. Think less ""curated wardrobe"" and more ""practical essentials with a touch of celebratory flair.""

Here's a breakdown of things to consider packing:

- **The Essentials:**
    
    
    - Clothing suitable for the weather forecast (layers are always a good idea!)
    - Comfortable walking shoes
    - Swimwear (if applicable)
    - Toiletries (travel-sized if possible)
    - Medications
    - Phone charger
    - Identification and any necessary travel documents (hotel confirmation, rental car info, etc.)
    - Credit cards and some cash
- **Fourth of July Fun:**
    
    
    - Something red, white, and blue to wear (even just a t-shirt!)
    - Small American flag or patriotic accessories
    - Sunscreen
    - Bug spray
    - Reusable water bottle
    - Portable speaker for music
    - Camera or phone for photos
- **Optional (Depending on your destination and plans):**
    
    
    - Beach towel or picnic blanket
    - Book or e-reader
    - Small backpack for day trips
    - Hat and sunglasses
    - Rain jacket or umbrella
    - Headlamp or flashlight (especially if camping)
- **Pro-Tip:** Lay everything out before you pack it into your bag. This helps you visualize what you're bringing and avoid overpacking. Roll your clothes instead of folding them to save space and reduce wrinkles.

The Spirit of Independence: Embracing the Spontaneous Adventure
---------------------------------------------------------------

There’s something undeniably exciting about embarking on a last-minute adventure, especially for a holiday like the Fourth of July. It’s a chance to break free from the routine, embrace the unexpected, and create memories that feel truly earned. When you don't have months to meticulously plan, you're more open to serendipity, those happy accidents that can lead to discovering incredible places and meeting interesting people.

Think of it as giving yourself permission to be a little bit reckless (in the best way possible!). It's a nod to the independent spirit the holiday celebrates – forging your own path, even if it's a slightly less conventional one. So, if you manage to snag one of these last minute July 4 getaways, go into it with an open mind and a willingness to roll with the punches. The best adventures are often those that aren't perfectly planned anyway.

### Making the Most of Your Unplanned Patriotic Pilgrimage

Okay, so you're on your way! What now? How do you ensure your spontaneous Fourth of July getaway is a roaring success? It's all about attitude and being present in the moment.

Here's how to maximize the fun:

- **Embrace the Local Vibe:** Forget trying to recreate a perfect, idealized Fourth of July experience. Immerse yourself in the local traditions and celebrations. Check out the town's parade, find out where the locals watch the fireworks, and try the regional food. This is where the unique charm of your destination will shine through.
- **Don't Be Afraid to Explore:** Wander off the beaten path a little. You never know what hidden gems you might discover – a quaint shop, a beautiful park, a delicious local eatery.
- **Strike Up Conversations:** Talk to the locals! They can give you the best recommendations for things to see and do, and you might learn something interesting about the area.
- **Be Flexible with Your Plans:** Since you're on a last-minute trip, things might not go exactly according to a rigid schedule (which you probably don't have anyway!). Be prepared to adjust your plans as needed. If one restaurant is too crowded, find another. If the weather changes, pivot to an indoor activity.
- **Focus on the Experience, Not Perfection:** Don't stress about minor inconveniences. Remind yourself that you're on a spontaneous getaway, and the imperfections can sometimes be part of the charm.
- **Take Lots of Pictures:** Capture the memories! Photos are a great way to look back on your spontaneous adventure and remember all the fun you had.
- **Allow for Downtime:** Even on a getaway, it's important to relax and recharge. Don't feel like you have to be constantly on the go. Enjoy a quiet morning with coffee, read a book in a park, or simply people-watch.

*Moncilat IV-B, Throne's Fortune Headquarters*

Nhoot had calmed down a little bit from her talk with Freelord Svitre. It was odd, he didn't smell like a Svitre, but that was a question for another time. The important thing was her new friend was sad. He was also very tall. Or he would be if he stood up, as he hadn't moved from the bed. He wasn't sleeping, his breathing was too irregular. Nhoot tapped the mattress of his bed, the lowest of a three-tiered bunk bed in order to let him know he was there.

A soft whimper was the reply.

Nhoot squared herself to do her job. ""Hihi, I'm Nhoot. Well, my full name's Lieutenant Junior Grade Ensign Nhoot and I'm eight I think but I'm a morale officer with the Terran Foreign Legion under Freelord Major Captain Gryzzk - I'm not s'posed to call him Gryzzk because he's Papa but he's not my real papa and we're on a ship called the *Twilight Rose* which is s'posed to be bad luck but I don't think that's right because we haven't had a lotta bad luck what's your name?""

Her new friend finally slowly moved to a sitting position, huddling in the corner. ""Pogrin.""

""That's a nice name, I like it."" Nhoot declared firmly as she sat on the bed. ""So how come you're here?""

""We were...we were on a field trip to Moncilat V."" Pogrin spoke softly as if afraid that saying would reveal a terrible secret.

""Oooh that sounds nice, are there birds there? Birds are nice I like the bird called turkey cause they're yummy, but not all birds are for eating some are for looking at but I don't know the difference because I'm not from Terra I'm from Hurdop. Well my parents were I've never been there but I've been to Vilantia twice and it was scary cause there's no ceiling but Papa said it was okay because it's a planet and planets don't need ceilings."" She paused for a moment. ""What's a field trip?""

""We go to places and see things. Moncilat V is where we harvest crystals for growing into things.""

Nhoot made a little oooh face. ""Are you still going to go?""

""No. It hurts.""

""What hurts? I mean my knees hurt a little but I think that's cause I was on Moncilat Prime and then they took me here and I'm heavier here than there."" There was a blink of realization. ""Ohhhh, you're from there so your everything hurts.""

There was a nod in reply. ""My...they said my sister needs to do things before they'll let me go. I don't think she's doing good things and it's my fault that she's doing bad things..."" Pogrin stopped talking to hide his face in his forearm.

Nhoot crawled closer and laid down with her head on his leg. ""Lord A'ogers says stuff like this is called Big Feelings and that it's okay to have Big Feelings about big things and this is a big thing and I watch Lord A'ogers and Little Seed Road a lot with some of the other folks on the ship cause they can't read and I can't read too good either so we're all learning to do that cause some clans don't have to read so they never teach them how but now we're in a different clan so we're all getting to learn.""

The admission appeared to stun Pogrin out of his misery. ""You...you can't read?""

""Well I can a little - not as good as Papa but Papa's been reading for a long time and I haven't so we should do something to make you hurt less."" Nhoot clambered up to the top bunk and pulled the mattress off of it awkwardly before wrestling it into position on the bottom bunk while Pogrin scrambled out of the way.

Nhoot settled it into place with a final effort. ""Better?""

Pogrin tested it a bit, looking at Nhoot. ""Better...you're not supposed to do that.""

""We're not supposed to be here so it's okay to do things we're not supposed to do. But you should go shower over there cause your fur smells ucky.""

""I...I don't know how to do that. There's no bathing tub.""

""Oh. So we have showers. That's it over there, it looks like it's a one-knob so you pull it out and twist for hot and cold and push the button for soap."" Nhoot paused. ""It might not be good soap but you should use it anyway because it's better than being ucky and I'll see if there's clean clothes anywhere. I'd help more but I can't make the shower taller so you're gonna have to have a crouchy shower. Sorry."" Nhoot grabbed Pogrin by the arms and tugged, being careful to guide him into the shower and close the door before she started rifling through the available shelves and finding some spare clothes.

Once everything was done, Pogrin looked only a little silly. The clothes were sized to a Vilantian adult, but they were still a little small and awkward on him. He slowly crawled back onto the bed and looked at Nhoot with a slightly curious expression as she was working disconnecting a small pipe from the wall. ""What...what are you doing?""

Nhoot grinned brightly. ""They didn't search me too good and Corporal Private Prumila gave me a multitool because she was sad and I helped her. Well, Papa helped her but she gave me this cause Papa didn't need one."" Nhoot returned to her rapid searching of the cell. ""So I'm gonna see if I can make a Learning Stick.""

""But...but why?""

""Well, 'cause Col'un and Prumila are gonna come help us get away when Papa comes to rescue us and we're gonna need to help them."" The absolute surety in her voice made Pogrin think for the first time that he wasn't going to be here for the rest of his life.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk leaned forward in his chair almost of his own accord, knowing that the conversation had several things now riding in the carriage. ""I'm listening. Present your barter."" He glanced at his tablet to see that Reilly had sent a simplified version of her chest tattoo as Gryzzk's clanmark.

His counterpart's posture and scent relaxed, someone who had done this many times before and never lost. ""Compensation for my clan and ships. Your clan leaves the system and swears on eternal honor to never return. Do this and the child returns to you unharmed within the week."" A ridiculous sum was shown on the screen.

The bridge stiffened at the gambit. The barter seemed a standard opening, with the highest possible bid - so it was his turn to demand as much as possible. ""Four of your clan are in my stockade. Leave the system with only your clan, save one ship. No hostages retained, no goods from Moncilat. We will rendezvous with your last sworn ship at Moncilat IV-A, hostage exchange to made via shuttlecraft. After that we will trouble you no more until our next contract calls for us to trouble you.""

There was a sniff in return and a wave of a jeweled gauntlet. ""Unacceptable. I have an armada of ships, and the ground beneath my feet is firm and rich. If your clan leaves and swears to never trouble mine again, the child will be in your arms in five days time.""

""Your ground is not as steady as you believe it to be. The Moncilat government seeks to make overture with the Terrans; mercenaries at first but of course after the mercenaries come the diplomats with their papers of promise."" Gryzzk gestured with his free hand to show the bridge. ""And then after that the Terran Self-Defense fleet arrives. Leave with every fifth piece of plunder while you can, no hostages. Exchange as previously specified.""

Svitre's form stiffened slightly at the news. The bartering had taken on a new tone, with much more than hostages at stake. ""I have friends who see the value of strong leadership. We already provide Moncilat what the Terrans only think they can, and at a much lower cost.""

""We have measured that assumption, and found it wanting. Three of your ships were disabled by a Terran ship with no weapons to speak of. Consider what would happen if you faced Terran ships that were armed. Consider that this ship and it's sister carry Terran weapons augmenting Vilantian plasma.""

""The Moncilat crave peace at any cost - even their own, as you've seen. You would be seen as the aggressor and subject to their law.""

""The Legion has proven it's value with only two companies and a handful of days. The only targets our wrath thus far have been objects with no crew to call their own. Do not speak to me of lawless acts when you sit upon Moncilat's stolen treasures and hurl death when your demands are unmet. You act as a spoiled cub who's milk is too warm. Take what objects you value and leave without trace, or you will watch from the twilight as your heirs argue over the precious things you wear before your body is even cold. A few hours of delay for an *honorable* foe would not be out of the realm of possibility."" Gryzzk shifted, calmly sipping at his tea.

There was a slight tapping as the other Freelord considered his options, finally shaking his head. ""To leave with so little would invite conflict within the clan born of my weakness. You're trying to take what I've rightfully stolen, and there is no wisdom in your words. We claim this system as Freeclan Svitre's in service to Hurdop. You enter without invitation. We both carry hostages, but yours are of no value to me. Kill them in whatever manner you see fit - they will be the first martyrs of the clanwar. As you are a fellow Freelord, you have one day of mercy. If you have not departed the system before highsun tomorrow, your daughter will greet you when you pass to the care of the dead gods."" The holo cut without a chance to respond.

Hoban chuffed softly, breaking the silence. ""If I didn't know better, I'd say I just watched the start of the Hatfields and the McCoys.""

Edwards shook her head. ""I'm thinking more War of the Roses.""

Gryzzk stood, straightening his uniform. ""Sergeant Reilly, open a channel to the *Stalwart Rose* and to the rest of the ship.""

Reilly tapped and nodded. ""We're hot.""

""All personnel. This is Freelord Gryzzk. I've just been in contact with the local Freelord of the Throne's Fortune. We have bartered for our clanmates to no avail and in one day our clan will be at war. This will not involve any other clans or governments. Where two clans once stood, only one will remain."" Gryzzk paused, feeling bitter weight on his tongue. ""For those who have not yet made a decision with respect to joining the freeclan, weigh this reality in your choice. The covenants surrounding clanwar are available from the ship's library. I expect familiarization, as that is the standard we will hold ourselves to. In any event, no matter your choice there will be no excess shame or honor accorded as a result of this, so long as you perform your Legion duties appropriately - the only difference will be in assignments for tomorrow. The Legion will guard the ship, the clan will rescue the clan. Choice is the essence of the freeclan, and I will not rob anyone under my command of that choice. With that said, those have made their choice within the twelve hours will report that choice to the XO for further assignment. That is all.""

Rosie arched an eyebrow smoothly at Gryzzk. ""Freelord Major, we were given twenty-four hours by Freelord Svitre.""

""Indeed we were, XO. However, there are two things to note. Firstly, I don't trust Freelord Svitre. Secondly, if we are to go to war we go to war on my signal, not his.""

""Fair enough."" Rosie cocked her head. ""Freelord Major, there is currently a line forming outside medical, and I am currently processing eighty-five separate queries regarding the precise molecular pattern needed for the printers to mimic your scent in liquid form. There is also a similar query from the stockade, as I may have accidentally allowed them to listen to their Freelord's barter.""

There was a ghost of a smile across Gryzzk's face. ""I suppose that means the decision's been made by most."" He sat for a moment, considering a plan. He needed more information to confirm if it was possible, which meant mentally steeling himself.

""Tuckers OK Corral Re-Enactors, Huckleberry speaking.""

""Chief I have a question - what is the shortest possible R-space jump both ships are capable of making?""

""I'm going to need some more details here.""

""The plan I am forming calls for a rapid strike to Moncilat IV-B behind the defensive line that will most likely forming over the course of the next. The most rapid form of transit available would be utilizing R-space, correct?""

""Major I'm not drunk enough to even consider the idea of an in-system R-space jump. Spin-up, spin-down, entry-exit points and grav-mass calculations...there's a reason jump coordinates are at the edges of a system and it's not because we like the ride."" There was a pause. ""Are you planning on rewriting the tactical manual as a hobby or is this some loony Vilantian thing?""

""Consider it a question from someone who does not know what cannot be done, does not care what shouldn't be done, and is rather keen on determining the most expeditious means of recovering his daughter and clan. If this question violates some law of physics, then we will plan within those parameters. However, if this is simply a matter of it being a difficult calculation, you have eleven hours to present the solution.""

""What happened to twelve?""

""I presume you will need an hour at the outset to think it over, curse my name, my parents, my wives, and swear under your breath at the damned fool of a Major while drinking excessive amounts of coffee before remembering some quirk within the ship's systems that will allow it to be done, then contacting the Chief Engineer of the *Stalwart Rose* to check your theory, and finally commencing the actual work.""

""Oh I'll be swearing loudly, Major. Would you care to listen in?""

""Not today, I have other conversations to have.""

""Lucky you."" There was a pause before Gryzzk heard Chief Tucker speaking to the engineering squad, having forgotten to disconnect. ""Alright my lovely batch of wingnuts, the Old Man in his infinite wisdom believes that drinking coffee while suffering builds character and he's determined to ensure that we have more character than an ensemble mega-movie...""

Gryzzk disconnected from his end, not really thrilled at the idea of actually listening to the deep vocabulary of Chief Tucker. ""XO, Chief Tucker has priority for computational cycles. Advise Stewart of our plan if you haven't already. Please tell me you able to isolate the signal source.""

""I have on both counts Freelord Major. Signal tracks back to Moncilat IV-B, facing the planet proper. *Stalwart Rose*'s chief engineer wants to know what drugs you are on and where he may acquire some.""

""I'll answer that later. For now, signal both ships for a tactical briefing."" Gryzzk moved to the conference room and settled in, looking over his tablet of half-scribbled notes.

The forms of both captains resolved slowly - Rosie had pulled power from communications already in order to begin the necessary computation. Gryzzk took a breath before beginning.

""Captains, here is the current form of the plan. We will be attacking Moncilat IV-B. To do this, Legion ships will be making an in-system R-space jump to get behind any defensive formations and make two orbits - the first orbit will be to fix position and confirm landing coordinates, and second will be an orbital bombardment of their position. The goal of this will be to neutralize any defensive emplacements and disable any craft that may launch from the surface. During that bombardment we will be executing a ground attack, landing troops at available entry points and subsequently moving through the facility. The rules of clanwar will be adhered to during this, Captain Rostin.""

Captain Rostin's face had a grim determination, while Captain Dulaine shifted uncomfortably before speaking. ""Major, I am unfamiliar with 'clanwar'. Please elaborate on this.""

""Simply put captain, the Throne's Fortune appears to be a collective of Hurdop clans. The clan that has taken a liking to this system finds it impossible to exist in concert with us. Quarter will not be given or offered to any who take up arms against the other clan. The only clans involved are the clans themselves and any secondary clans. Calling upon clan alliances is nominally forbidden, however covert aid has been known to happen. Tradition dictates that participants mark themselves with a wrist tattoo that has the respective Lord's scent mixed in. The war will end when one clan ceases to exist, either by forswearing their clan allegiance or by death to the last.""

""That is...brutal."" Captain Dulaine quivered visibly at the thought.

Gryzzk offered a weak smile. ""I concur with that assessment. But such is the reality before us. That said Captain, your assignment within this is observational only. Take your ship and make for Moncilat IV-B at best speed. We will be relying on your sensors to provide intelligence with respect to any ship movements as rapidly as possible. Do not place your ship in excessive danger.""

""Understood."" Captain Dulaine settled back in his chair.

""Captain Rostin, any questions?""

There was a headshake. ""No questions, however the crew has requested a sample in order to properly mimic your scent.""

""Have your medical team send the request over - but do not expect rapid response, as my medbay is currently...busy."" Gryzzk gestured to the two forms. ""If there are no further inquiries, Captains - to your duties. Good fortune, and good hunting.""

Gryzzk emerged from the conference room to find the bridge was more active and crowded than he liked. The scent of the room seemed as if he'd been here a bit more than he actually had, the Moncilat were crouched next to Hoban and Reilly with the two were being briefed on the controls and adjustments needed for their stations. In addition to this, the squad all had small bandages on their right wrists.

""XO, there is an explanation I am waiting to hear.""

Rosie smirked a bit. ""Well, Yomios and Miroka are both bridge-qualified in their respective positions and requested an amendment to their passenger contracts - I decided it best to grant that request as they both appear to have beneficial skills and the danger clause of their contracts does allow us to utilize them aboard the ship as needed. I'll let Yomios make her additional request, as it requires your authorization.""

Gryzzk settled into his chair, waiting for Yomios to wrap up whatever she was doing and make her request.

Yomios lingered next to Reilly as Reilly finished her explanations, then glanced back as Reilly gave a nod and a small thumbs-up gesture. To her credit, Yomios wasn't quivering physically, but her scent was highly uncertain as she looked around before finally looking down at Gryzzk.

""Major. I understand that you initially came to this profession as an observer. I should like to fulfill the same role tomorrow. I have visited the armory and they have selected...'side arms' that they think would be most functional in addition to a mobile communications suite. I believe it would be beneficial for the children that are being held there to see a familiar face. With respect, the scent of the Terrans and yours is aggressive even in friendship.""

Rosie coughed delicately. ""Major, her record is excellent within her duties. Her marksmanship is suspect.""

Gryzzk tapped a finger absently against his tablet. ""Sergeant Major, I'm certain you have an opinion regarding this.""

The slight touch of O'Brien’s accent was enough for Gryzzk to know her thoughts fully before she'd completed her first sentence. ""Major, on paper it's not so bad. But the reality's pretty real here - you're taking a bunch of risks. That said we're all so damned short compared to them that it'd take an act of Our Lord and Savior Private Murphy for her to cause a friendly fire incident. And at the end of the day you won't feel right denying someone else the chance you got. Even if it might come back to stab you in the back. Or the top of your fuzzy head.""

""If that should occur I will be in an excellent position to deal with it promptly."" Gryzzk voice was calm, but the flare of fear from Yomios communicated all he needed to know. ""Very well. XO, note in the log that Miroka is to be temporarily rostered as a Specialist pilot and Yomios will be listed as an observer for tomorrow. She will be accompanying my team on the ground, while Miroka pilots my shuttle."" Gryzzk gestured to dismiss Yomios, wondering just what tomorrow would bring. It was time to get things in order.

""Captain Hoban. Escort Specialist Miroka to shuttle and assist in familiarizing her with the shuttle flight controls.""

Hoban nodded with a large smile. ""Will do, Major."" He stood and took Miroka's hand.

Gryzzk lifted his right eyebrows. ""And Captain. Remind the flight personnel that there will be no fornication within the shuttles or shuttle bays. Am I clear?""

Hoban's mood didn't visibly deflate, but his scent changed to something slightly less enthusiastic. ""Yessir.""",24,1747407640.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

Not literally, but in paperwork, confusion, and that soul-sucking feeling of trying to start a business and being hit with a thousand hidden costs. Starting my own LLC in Pennsylvania felt like stepping into a maze with no exit signs. Every click online led to another $199 service fee or a ""limited-time offer"" that somehow always ended in disappointment and another dent in my already fragile bank account.

I didn’t have a cushion. No investor. No inheritance. Just a big idea and a tired laptop.

Everywhere I turned, there was someone asking for money. “Need to file your LLC? $125!” “Want an EIN? That’s extra.” “Oh, and don’t forget your registered agent — that'll be a yearly subscription fee that magically renews even if you forget.”

It was exhausting. I almost gave up. And honestly? I cried.

And then, one night — probably around 2 AM, fueled by cheap coffee and frustration — I stumbled on something that felt like a joke. A site called https://HolyShitLLC.com. I clicked with the same hesitation you get before walking into a weirdly cheap mechanic shop. But what I found stopped me in my tracks.

They were offering exactly what every aspiring entrepreneur dreams of: a way to start an LLC in Pennsylvania for free. No asterisks. No buried fees in mouse-sized print. Not only that — they threw in a free registered agent and a free EIN.

I thought it was a scam. I went full detective mode. I Googled. I asked around. I looked up reviews. And it kept checking out. People were saying the same thing I was thinking: Holy sht — this is real.*

So I did it. I followed the steps. Simple, human, clear. No legal jargon that sounds like it came from a courtroom drama. No upselling at every turn. I registered my LLC, got my EIN, had a legit registered agent — all of it — for free.

And when I got that confirmation email that my LLC was official, I just sat there and stared at it. It felt like winning. Not the lottery — something better. It felt like my dream wasn’t out of reach anymore.

Look, I don’t know what your idea is. Maybe it’s a food truck. Maybe it’s a clothing brand. Maybe it’s a blog, a side hustle, or a tech startup. Whatever it is, if the only thing holding you back is the cost of getting started, I’m telling you right now: it doesn’t have to be.

Go to https://HolyShitLLC.com. Do it. Start the thing. Say yes to your dream. Because if I hadn’t found them, I might still be crying over hidden fees and thinking my future had a price tag I couldn’t afford.

It wasn't just one of those polite grins, either. It was like she saw me, ya know? And for a moment, I felt less like I was floating alone and more like I was tethered to the world again.

It's crazy how such a small thing can make you feel like you belong, even if just for a bit. I think it helps me feel thankful and reminds me that sometimes connection doesn't need to be dramatic.

Customers tip well, I have good rapport with the regulars even though it’s only been 6 months since I’ve transferred here, and I make a point to have a good relationship with my coworkers. 

I just can’t keep up with the contradictions of *what to do that’s policy vs what to do in the moment vs when to communicate vs when to just do the action vs—* you get the idea. And I don’t know if it’s my tone or my energy or what, but I guess everything about my whole build just rubs people the wrong way. This inevitably happens in every social circle I’m in, no matter what age or industry or activity, no matter how nice or responsive or intuitive or communicative or receptive I am. 

At this point, it’s just confirmation that my personality is the problem. And I’ve tried changing that repeatedly; so I guess it’s time to intervene with force.

**This game has some of the best bones I've seen in a very very long time. This is so promising and a project I'm looking forward to more than GTA6 TBH.**

**Tyler has created a beautiful, simple, effective, and incredibly addictive sandbox to play in. I have one key criticism I'm hoping is in the works to remedy but I'll save that for after my vigorous, emphatic handjob.** 

  
You can tell hours and hours of thought have been lovingly poured over this game. The map design is simple, easy to understand... yet nuanced (some spots you can only get through by crouching... but that makes them fantastic for losing the fuzz... same with buildings you can go behind and risk falling in the drink) and deep, and full of easter eggs (graffiti, wheelchairs on rooftops, giant spoon?)... The customers willing to spend the most are the furthest from your properties. As you scale up and get vehicles, the map opens up to those larger more sparse areas. Bravo. 

I also love that as barebones as this game is there's still clever nuance... like you should absolutely buy the warehouse before the barn even though the barn is half the price. The warehouse is way closer to your clients until you unlock the last area, and it has ample space to start cocaine. There's the storage unit property perfectly located for back stock and storage of product and mixers. I ended up making it my man cave.. it has a bed, a safe with my weapons, storage racks with signage labeling all my bricks of product... I put purple led's over all my product racks and artwork on the wall behind it. Jukebox as the center piece of course and coffee tables with product samples and a sign at the back illuminated reading simply, ""i guess we made it unc..."".

Fuck this game scratched an itch I didn't know was there. At it's core it's about entrepreneurship and the difficult balance between networking and production, negotiation and marketing, it's so so good. In the early and mid game you find yourself deciding how your time is best spent as there are just too many tasks each day. 

The soundtrack. When the beat dropped on ""unaltered"" I had just started cooking meth. Holy shit the level of locking in. I stood up and adjusted my monitor to play standing bc I got so hyped lol, I'm 36, I can't remember the last time a game lit me up like this... I think bloodborne was the last time... The soundtrack produces impeccably perfect vibes for this game... the balance of chill and drive is so satisfying. Sometimes the music hits and I just slow down and reflect. Hold V and watch myself bask in the glory that is my empire. . . 

I could go on but no one wants to read my ramblings... I'll cut to my favorite piece and then my criticism.   
  
My absolute favorite part of the game is that time fucking stops at 4am. I can't tell you how many late nights I spent planning my next day, finishing up product, creating new mixes, setting up automation, improving my workflows and optimizing production 6 sigma style (I worked as a production manager at a commercial printing plant focused on lean and 6 sigma and you absolutely can and should employ those basic principles to your S1 operations. Racks of ingredients behind your mixers, start at the back of your property for stage 1 and have your finished product pop out at the front for easy storage and access, etc.). There's something special that happens when all the npc's are asleep and it's just you and the night. The best part is it somehow ENHANCES IMMERSION rather than breaking it. I have a checkered past and spent some time staying up all night doing drugs in my late teens and early 20s and I can confirm time does stand still at 4am. This also builds one the entrepreneurship vibe. Anyone who has started their own business knows the more seat you put in early on the better your chances. Anyone who has started their own business is no stranger to late nights trying to catch up on things. Again, 4am, time stands still when you're working your ass off. 

This leads nicely into my criticism. The game, after a while, feels a bit empty and dead. This is good at 4am, but after a while, the whole game feels this way.

There are effectively no consequences. Shoot cops? they totally forget within a minute of hiding from them. Shoot a customer? They'll buy product from you within minutes. Leave a contact hanging with debt for months on end, no consequences. Leave a dealer without product for months, no consequences.  I want more immersion from these aspects. 

If Benji runs out of product, his customers should start to get antsy and be bugging him, and he should then be pissed at you. Maybe consider leaving for a rival gang, maybe send his customers to you to get them off his back, maybe unassign all his customers, maybe you have to give him another starter fee to get him going again. Also, Benji should have side quests! maybe to unlock him as a dealer you have to help him get his driver's license back bc it's revoked bc he's a dumbass. Maybe you have to help him steal back his something or other from the rival dealer. I want the NPC's to have more depth to them. Random customers could have side quests too... think cranky frank, the rabbi/pastor, the politician etc... 

I want there to be more of a narrative or goal in the game. Is uncle nelson trying to lobby the government to legalize substances? Does he want to become the mayor? does he want us to become the mayor while he pulls the strings in the back? Does he want us to pull the strings and use someone in the world as a figure head and push them to mayorship? Once my warehouse and barn were printing money with 10 employees each and full automation there is little motivation to keep chugging along. I need some broader goals to keep me going. The friction of having to grow weed yourself and use the 100 packager at first etc is awesome. You get that sweat equity feeling of starting from the absolute bottom. But as you grow and automate, eventually you run out of runway for process improvement, and there needs to be something beyond that to motivate you to continue. Process improvement for the sake of it can only take you so far.

Integrate some mini games, have your character handle them differently if you're fucked up. Maybe create societies or cliques or something, like factions where you can earn reputation and gain access to different customers or even clothing/decorations/furniture or additional strains of weed or mixing ingredients. Maybe allying with one faction hurts your rep with another and they eventually become hostile and won't buy products from you.

1ko2tht,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1ko2tht/review_of_recent_nickelodeon_trip/,Review of Recent Nickelodeon Trip,"⚠️ Warning: Long Review Ahead — But Worth the Read

I’m writing this in detail because we struggled to find comprehensive information before our recent trip (2 adults + 4-year-old) to Nickelodeon Punta Cana. The lack of transparency was surprising and, frankly, concerning. While the resort has some strong points—like the friendly staff and beautiful grounds—our overall experience means we won’t be returning.

For families without dietary restrictions or special needs, this could still be a decent option. But if you’re relying on concierge services or specific accommodations, be warned: their promises often don’t match reality.

 
🛎️ Overview of Key Issues

We booked a Nest Suite directly through their site, including roundtrip BRX transfers and a promo for $340 in resort credits. Despite confirming multiple times—before and during the trip—we were ultimately only allowed to use one of the three promotional offers. The others were denied with shifting explanations.

The most serious issue we encountered was the lack of promised breast milk storage. Staff pre-arrival assured us they could provide a freezer or safe storage area. In reality, we were given access only to a communal refrigerator. It wasn't cold enough to preserve milk safely, and every bag my wife pumped had to be discarded. This was devastating, especially since she was pumping to donate to NICU babies.

Worse yet, this wasn’t a miscommunication: we had everything in writing, confirmed in both English and Spanish.

On to some more specifics:

The Good

-Staff- here I'm referring to anyone you passed in the hallway, interacted with at the pool/waterpark, and stopped to ask for help. Almost every single one said hello and tried to high five or wave to our son. Kudos to them all for providing some great interactions that our son is still talking about.

-Beach pool- decently maintained and great views of the beach/ocean.

-Waterpark- pretty much exactly as advertised. Shoutout to some of the staff there who enthusiastically high-fived our son each and every time he ran back to the top of the slide. Their enthusiasm definitely added to the fun!

-Kids splash pad- I didn't remember seeing/reading about this. It was a small, quiet splash pad with a slide, some water cannons, and chairs next to a playground on the resort side. Perfect for small children.

-Kids indoor climbing playground- again a nice, quiet place for kids to play (plus AC).

-Waterpark snack bar- small bites with good drinks and friendly staff. 

-Verdello- hands down the best food of the trip. I wish we could have eaten here every day!

-Turtle Power dinner- food was again not great, but that's not why you go to this show. There were a few games for the kids to play and the turtles individually came to every table for photos. For reference (and because it isn't listed anywhere), the cost is $51 per adult and $41 per child.

-Orange Carpet show- great energy and lots of characters. Get there early to try to grab a seat!

-BRX- we had to wait ~20 min for the van to pick us up from the airport, but the drivers were courteous, cars were clean, and we never felt unsafe on the roads. They even offered to stop at pickup and at dropoff in case we needed any supplies.

The Bad

-Buffet- decently large area with outdoor seating and a two-level inside. The food needs better allergy signage. Literally one item (chickpea salad) was marked vegetarian. Very limited options for our family given our vegetarian diet and our son's egg allergy.

-Sweetery- decent coffee and small pastry bites. No egg-free options (including the ice cream/gelato). No real vegetarian food options. I wouldn't consider this as more than a small snack shop.

-Paw Patrol show- this was not a show. It was 20 seconds of the characters saying hello and then a photo op. Not necessarily a bad thing, but just call it a meet+greet instead of a show!

The Ugly

-Food in general- we follow a vegetarian diet and our son is severely allergic to eggs. We knew food wouldn't be bountiful (nor were we expecting a lot), but this was way worse than we anticipated. Food wasn't only scarce with regard to options, it often just wasn't available. Everything shuts down for several hours midday (sans the waterpark snack bar and coffee shop). The adults were able to eat okay enough at the buffet thanks to the made-to-order omelets for breakfast and pasta for lunch/dinner. But boy did those get old quickly. Prior to arrival, and at their request, we communicated our son's dietary restrictions and were told that ""We truly appreciate you sharing your son's severe egg allergy and your family's vegetarian preferences. Rest assured, our culinary team is experienced in managing special dietary needs and will take every precaution to avoid cross-contamination. While we don't have full sample menus available for each restaurant, I'm happy to confirm that all our restaurants can prepare egg-free and vegetarian dishes upon request. Once you check in, we recommend speaking directly with your server and concierge to ensure each meal is tailored to your family's needs. We'll also add a note to your reservation regarding these requirements for extra care throughout your stay."" The only ""tailoring"" that was done at any meal was at Verdello, where somebody told us that our son couldn't eat the focaccia. We spent much of the trip hungry. However, if you don't have any dietary restrictions the buffet had plenty of meat/seafood options.

-Communication/itinerary- the app is for iPhone only so we couldn't download it. The only way to see any information is from the room TV. I know it's the 21st century, but a map or print out would have been welcome for this Android user. We took a picture at the start of each day, but half of the events didn't take place. We were there during a slow season, but if they weren't going to host the events, wouldn't it be nice to communicate that? We tried to attend the 8am stretching on the beach multiple times but it wasn't ever hosted. There was a mythical QR code that our concierge promised to share with us upon our arrival that he never sent, and it wasn't until our second full day that I found it (after I walked into a closed restaurant and saw it on the host stand) and was able to make reservations. The maps on their website have outdated names for locations, which only added to the confusion when trying to locate character meet+greets or events.

-Room service- it was certainly edible. We ordered several times because it was the only real option during naptime. Very limited menu and it was hit or miss with timing and temperature. Our family was only able to order a quesadilla, grilled veggies, and buttered pasta. Not even options to add water or drinks!

-Check-in- I'm not exaggerating...within 3 minutes of walking through the door I was passed around to 6 different people all telling me different things. When I made it to the front desk I was immediately asked if we wanted to upgrade. I asked for the price and room options. I was first told $160 for the trip. I said great- can we please apply the $200 promotional credit from our booking and I'll take the upgrade. He walked away, came back and said that the price was now $240 per night and that I couldn't use my promotional credits because he didn't know what they were. I pushed back but was met with resistance. Ultimately I declined the upgrade. No real harm, but part of the reason we chose the package we did was that we knew we'd be offered an upgrade and the $200 credit was more than the price difference between our room and the swim-up suite at booking. My real mission was to ensure that our pack-and-play and in-room freezer were delivered so that we could get ready for bed after properly storing the milk. It took more than 2.5 hours of running around afterwards to finally get a crib delivered and sort out the ""freezer"" situation in the lobby. Concierge was no help.

-Check-out- we had a 9:30 golf cart pickup to take us to the lobby for our 9:55 BRX transport. BRX was there early so I got my wife and son set up in the van before heading inside to check out. I was told we owed $143 for the Turtle Power dinner and that I couldn't leave until the bill was settled. I told them about the promo credit, showed the email from the concierge weeks before our trip confirming that the promo would be applied and our total would be $51, and then showed them the promo on their website. Front desk told me there was nothing he could do. Sent me to concierge. Concierge took my phone, left for ~10 minutes, then told me front desk would take care of it. Front desk doesn't say a word for ~5 min and is just clicking on the computer. Meanwhile, outside, my family is being harassed by staff demanding the check-out ticket. In all it took more than 30 minutes before the front desk told me he would adjust the bill ""even though he shouldn't"" because ""he's never heard of this promo"" and ""he wasn't sure if it was real.""

-Concierge- I want to say his name was Manuel, but we never heard from him after the first night. My last 4 WhatsApp messages (his preferred method of communication) were read but never responded to. He ghosted us almost immediately and only provided a modicum of help day 1 when I walked back to the lobby to try to get the aforementioned in-room freezer and a pack-and-play for our son. 

-Kids accommodations- for a resort intended to cater to kids, it was bizarre how things weren't geared more towards them. For example, the in-room bathroom had a towel bar at waist/knee level in front of the bowl sink. I had to lift up my son and hold him horizontally to reach the faucet to wash his hands. Why not have a more standard sink, no towel bar, and perhaps a stepstool to help kids?

-Room issues- our rainfall shower head only worked for one night. We were able to use the detachable shower wand without issues. There was a consistent leak around one of the recessed lights in the bedroom that left a puddle (but more concerningly was seemingly dripping around electric wires). Our in-room phone stopped working after the first day and could not place outgoing calls. Not the end of the world with WhatsApp and the TV, right? Well since our concierge ghosted us the only way we could communicate was by walking back to the lobby. Which I did ~15 times to ask for bottles of water, new towels, toilet paper, a golf cart to pick us up for checkout, etc. Our room was not once restocked with water, snacks, toilet paper, or towels--we had to seek them out daily.

Under different life and family circumstances I could see this being an okay resort. We ultimately went here because of everything they promised us before/during/after we booked. Between the constant up-selling, horrible food options (especially for our needs), and the concierge/front desk staff being intentionally misleading or merely ill-informed this was a 1.5/5 experience for a resort that could easily be a 4/5. We've been to several all-inclusives and this was far and away the worst experience. Part of the appeal is to not have to worry about anything...we were constantly on edge about how we'd get food for everyone, where we could get more bottled water to clean the pump parts and quench our thirst, and where/when/if the next scheduled event would take place.

If you're just going to relax with slightly older kiddos, don't have dietary restrictions or special requests, and have an iPhone you could do worse. But you certainly can also do better. If you do choose to go, I'd definitely recommend a swim-up suite. I also recommend not staying for more than 4-5 nights, especially if you don't venture off property. Many of the other parents/families we met down there were bored and out of things to do by the fou full day.

TL;DR: Nice grounds, friendly staff, and fun waterpark—but poor food for vegetarians, failed accommodations for prespecified needs (like breast milk storage), and misleading promotions soured our stay.

Now, when we’re literally a walking distance apart, our calendars are filled with “somedays”, “maybes” and “one days”.

I guess six timezones is more motivating than a calendar full of blank spaces.

When she’d fly back home, and no matter where she’d rent her apartment in our hometown, I would make those spaces for her.

She’d do it, too.

We’d see each other on a regular basis during her few-month visits.

Coffee. Walks. Clubbing. Chilling in a park. Healthy food crawling. Strolling along the river. Getting tipsy at food festivals.

Honest talks on her couch. Ridiculous conversations on benches. Gossiping by the pool. Absurd debates when we’re about to say goodbye to each other on the street.

We had that kind of connection that feels rare, and so f’n easy at the same time.

Now?

She lives a thirty-minute walk away.

And if we see each other once a month, we call it a win!

No timezones.

No flights.

No clocks ticking.

Not limited by time.

Not limited by distance.

**Limited only by the illusion that we have forever.**

But we don’t.

She’s leaving again soon.

And this time for good.

Here’s the uncomfortable part: We still aren’t planning any get-togethers.

Not because I’m busy.

Not because she’s changed.

But because nothing is changing.

Because somewhere in our minds — we still have time.

That lie is so easy to believe when someone is close by.

We treat nearness like permanence.

And permanence like a guarantee.

And when something is guaranteed, it can wait.

Until it is urgent.

Until there is no more time.

Until someone’s boarding a plane.

Only then does the urgency return.

And I’m not just taking her presence for granted.

I’m taking for granted my book, the one I truly believe in and have millions of reasons to finish. The one that just needs a little more courage… A little more clarity… A little more time… (Remind me to write a piece about how having time is not an excuse for anything, for you always have time, you are just setting poor priorities.)

I’m taking for granted my drive of walking the Camino, an adventure so close to my heart that I already feel it pounding after a whole day of hiking. But first, I need to finish that first book. Because the second one is about the Camino itself. So I’m dragging my feet on both. What a perfect system…

I’m taking for granted my dream of volunteering at a dog shelter far away. I have no idea where, but see it so clearly… and do nothing. Because “my pooch has a limited time here with me and I can’t leave him for other dogs”.

I’m taking for granted all the workbooks I’ve already started. “I need a more stable income”, I keep telling myself — not realizing that publishing the first one could be the very thing that creates it.

What am I waiting for?

**A notion that I will die soon, I guess.**

Because we always think we’ll have time.

We believe we’ll start when things are easier, clearer or more stable.

But easiness, clarity and stability don’t come from being passive.

It comes from actively showing up — before we become forced to.

Before the opportunity expires.

She’s still here.

And so am I.

What a waste if I didn’t call her.

Because we certainly don’t get to choose how much time we have — but we do get to choose how we’ll use it.",1,1747407111.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1ko2t5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ko2t5y/reviewing_cirrus_perfumes_like_its_my_full_time/,Reviewing Cirrus Perfumes Like It's My Full Time Job,"I'm back for another round! Completely new to perfumes here, and so I've been slowly experimenting with different kinds of scents across various houses to find out what I click with. My last go round was testing out some atmospherics with Solstice Scents, which unfortunately tended to pull very sweet on me. Cirrus is the third house I've tried, and I bought from them on a whim after seeing them recommended for scents that are cozy & clean, but not sweet. 

I kinda started out this journey imagining myself wearing earthy fuzzy skin scents. I wanted to smell like true violet leaves, dry grass, roasted grains, cacao paste, coffee beans, etc. Cirrus doesn't tend to an earthy scent profile, but I ended up liking almost everything I tried from them. It opened up whole new understandings for me of my likes and dislikes, and I was very surprised by my favorites! Their perfume Antique Nouveau, for example, fits right in with what I like which I never would have guessed by reading the description and reviews. 

# The Short:

**CIRRUS EXPERIENCE** 
Their website is thoughtfully designed and it's easy to catch the vibe of each perfume. The notes are all listed upfront in the photo scroll with a full ingredient list, longer descriptions, and customer reviews(!) when you click in. I found the descriptions poetic and pretty accurate to my experience - very practical for decision making. In fact, it was unusually easy for me to come to a decision on my order and I believe this is due in large part to the care that has been put into curating and showcasing the catalogue - I really appreciated it! My perfumes arrived quickly and the formulations worked well for me. They didn't go sweet, they had good longevity & presence, and they mostly kept their personality throughout the wear and drydown. 

**REVIEWS IN BRIEF**
I got a sample pack of 5 oils plus a limited edition sample, and let Cirrus pick my freebie. Snooze and Laundry Day were pleasant creamy-musky scents ft. cardamom and lavender/bergamot, respectively. My preference for spices leaned me heavily towards Snooze, but I enjoyed testing them both. I also really liked It's Just Pears..., it does just what it says, does it well, and wears very comfortably. It's good on its own, but I'm also excited to try layering that one! Brushfire completely intrigued me as a smokey dry grass scent but unfortunately I have a reaction to it that makes it hard for me to wear. I came in with totally wrong expectations for Landscaper Fanfic - I wanted dirt & wild mint and I got it, but was thrown for a loop when it wore as cologne. Meanwhile Sybarite and Antique Nouveau were both unexpected favorites, with Sybarite completely changing the game for me and sparking my interest in florals in a big way

# The Long:

**MY PREFERENCES** 
(Still evolving)
- Likes: earthy, spicy, fruity, floral - a sense of warmth or even scorch, and more abstractly roundness / airiness / dimensionality. 
- Dislikes: heavy sweetness, this one note/combination of notes that reminds me of my dad's old drakkar noir cologne and might involve oakmoss ?

**THE PROCESS**
These were all rested and worn for two months before their review writeup (and a week or more before first wear). I've tested each once on paper, and on skin several times. I wore each perfume for at least one full day to review, taking into account in the writeup any notes and impressions I had from previous tests.

**RATINGS SYSTEM** 
0-3 something turns me off this. 4-6 I enjoy this perfume but it doesn't hold my interest. 7-10 I would keep coming back for this

**REVIEWS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER**
___________________________
## Antique Nouveau
**Expectations**
My free sample, described as a classic chypre. No idea what to expect & wouldn't have picked it myself, but curious to smell it as a learning experience

**Notes**
*Bergamot, oakmoss, patchouli, vetiver, coumarin, iris, jasmine sambac, heliotrope, peony, labdanum, benzoin, opoponax, pinyon pine, cedarwood, clove*

**Experience**
> Opens citrus-y, lightly spicy, bitter like the peel. Warm, woody base. I briefly get an impression of not-quite-minty freshness. As it dries it's sweetened by subtle florals. I wonder if this is what people mean when they describe something as powdery? There's a quality here that's not unlike catching a puff of confectioners sugar. At this stage (maybe an hour in or so) it vaguely reminds me of an herbal hard candy, or a lozenge (probably the clove?). It has throw but not an overwhelming presence. Sometimes I'll catch whiffs at random but it's a bit evasive. I can smell it on my wrist until I sniff at it too much. My sister liked it and described it as ""old lady"". In the late stages the powdery candy vibe gets even airier, and plays off a deeper perfume/cologne musky woody thing.
>
> My first few tries of this perfume I got a heavy impression of the cologne thing that I also get from Landscaper Fanfic - to the point of mentally categorizing them together, even. But for some reason I don't really notice it anymore, or rather, I do, but it's changed from foreground to background and doesn't bother me. Is it the oakmoss?? Is this a taste I am acquiring? If so, why does it still smell stronger to me in Landscaper Fanfic given that Antique Nouveau is supposed to have the higher concentration? Mysteries on mysteries. I have deep suspicions that it's somewhat a combination of notes interacting with each other, rather than oakmoss on its own.

8/10 - surprisingly, I really like this one. I think resting either mellowed it, or my tastes have been changing since I first tried it a few months ago. It's subtle, sweet, gently spicy, and has that sheer, shifting quality that pleases me. It feels both comfortable and put together - as suitable for stopping by the post office on the way home from work as it is for sitting on the couch in a clean house and reading quietly with a loved one.  
___________________________
## Brushfire
**Expectations**
The scent that sold me on placing an order. I'm on the hunt for a good hay/dry grass scent and the description with oudh and smokiness and hint of fruit sounded amazing

**Notes**
*Dried golden straw, smoke, apple skins, osmanthus, 7 year aged Laotian oudh, vetiver, roast barley, solar notes*

**Experience**
> Okay... I am so deeply unsure about this one. Woody and smokey, very dry, slightly spicy, almost soapy even? Like, in the sense of having a basic, astringent quality to it. It packs one of the strongest punches of the bunch, wafting aromatic smokiness from my wrists in a big way as the day starts off, and still gently wafting even 6, 7 hours in. Despite how powerful it is, it feels nuanced and diffusive, and it has this gorgeous warm undertone underlying the crisp breezy smokiness. It feels more atmospheric to me than any of the others I've sampled from Cirrus, but it still retains a romanticized element that smells (lol I wish I had better words, but-) *really* fucking good. It's beautiful and rich and feels very natural, not quite ~Perfume~ shaped, but also not *not* perfume shaped. 
>
> The issue is, it also has a tickly scratchy quality that's really irritating my sinuses. If I get too close or smell too deeply I regret it. It's more of a feeling than a smell - like I have dust in the back of my throat - and it dominates my experience of the perfume. After about 3-4 hours it eases up a bit as the perfume begins to mellow, but still ghosts around and haunts me with a lightly congested feeling and a feeling like I need to sneeze. I infinitely prefer this irritating dryness to the choking, syrupy sweetness that was my experience with Alkemia's A Roll In The Hay, but is this the neccesary tradeoff? Am I having some sort of allergic reaction or am I just sensitive to how crackly and smokey it is? I haven't been bothered by other smokey scents the way I am by this one.

3/10 - The description on the site reads remarkably true, and it's beautiful - an idealized barn, a brush pile burn, a distant apple peel. But I feel I might have an allergy - has anyone else has this experience? Even the memory is making my face ache. I want to wear this again but I just don't know if I can

## It's Just Pears...
**Expectations**
I love a mf pear

**Notes**
*A fresh, juicy, slightly overripe and musky Bartlett pear - spiked with brandy over a honeyed amber base*

**Experience**
> Opens fresh! Sweet! Almost but not quite sugared! Half an hour in it has deepened, mellowed, goldened but not changed significantly in character. As it wears the pear ripens a bit, settles in, and begins to fade into the musk, but I never lose it completely. 10 hours on my skin and sniffing closely there is a less distinct but still very much pear-shaped impression.

6/10 - exactly what I came for. The pear is a very satisfying impression to my nose. It goes on sweet and fresh and pear-y, and stays true throughout, gaining some huskiness as it wears. Not overwhelming in strength or sillage, but it's strong on the skin and I kept catching vague whiffs without needing to try.
___________________________
## Landscaper Fanfic
**Expectations**
Here for the dirt and the mint and the soft clover. The description brought me back to my first rental house and the jungle of weeds and morning dew that was my yard. I am so ready to smell like earth on the roots of freshly pulled weeds!

**Notes**
*Wet, herbal mint leaves, oakmoss, clary sage, flowering clover, and new mulch*

**Experience**
> The strongest thing about this scent for me is a note or a vibe that evokes memories of my dad's cologne. I was initially repulsed and I even entirely missed the mint the first time I tried it. My friend had the same experience - smelling it on me, her first and second impressions were ""dad"" and ""dad... but less"". On re-test, I do get mint and dirt, just not the way I was expecting. It smells kinda good? Do I like it? It's still so dad? I've found myself coming back to this one a lot - I like a puzzle and scents I can't decide on tend to get extra points.
>
> Possibly an aside, but I've seen this recced as an atmospheric which is bewildering to me and makes me think I have a more literal expectation of what an atmospheric entails. To me, this does not smell like being outside, or even like a realistic/un-idealised just-came-in-from-outdoors skin scent. Instead, this is a scent that's somewhat abstracted and contrived, distinctly arranged by human hands rather than something I could come across by wandering the neighborhood. True to its name, the gently overgrowing yard of my imagination is brought to order. The dirty note is mulch rather than soil.  

6/10 - For a perfume that has that dad-cologne vibe that puts me off, it's surprised me with how much I keep coming back to it. The mint lasts. Good throw and longevity. I would recommend this to others who are curious about it, with the note to come in expecting a cologne shaped scent. It's not at all what I had hoped from it, but it's nicely done.
___________________________
## Laundry Day
**Expectations**
Here to try those clean & cozy vibes

**Notes**
*Clean white laundry musk, lavender, vanilla, earl grey tea, and New Caledonia sandalwood*

**Experience**
> It opens almost a little waxy - not like the *smell* of wax, but like, the feeling of it. Just on the right side of strong, this is a gentle wall of laundry detergent and bergamot. As it dries it rounds out, feels warm and fuzzy and creamy. I start getting that quality of almost-but-not-quite sour that I also get from Snooze. Not too long into wear, maybe an hour or so, it starts feeling a little faded. Its laundry and a *hint* of tea and sweet vanilla if u sniff close, but mostly an indistinct creamy musky thing. It stays present for several hours after, quiet and somewhat muddled

5/10 - This one is pleasant, but not strongly my thing, nor does it stand out to me on any fronts. Slightly sour creamy-musk skin scent that evokes laundry.
___________________________
## Snooze
**Expectations**
Especially excited to try a cardamom scent, curious about how it will compare and differ with Laundry Day

**Notes**
*Tonka bean, lilac, vanilla absolute, green cardamom, cashmere cardigans, white chocolate, and plumeria over a modernized chypre base*

**Experience**
> This is a sharp and creamy cardamom.  Slightly musky and almost-but-not-quite sour to me, but not really in a bad way. Maybe this is just how I interpret creaminess? The base is sweet and dry, and it's well balanced by the light scorch of the cardamom. I'm not able to pick out any florals. The cardamom is very forward for me and everything else is mostly combining to make a pretty background for it. Around the three hour mark the cardamom begins to take a step back, melting and mellowing into the rest of the perfume rather than solo-ing. 
>
> Abstractly, it does feel a lot like the description on the website, snuggling into your sheets on a cold day that gradually warms up. It's kind of cool and warm simultaneously, like the impression of body heat left behind as limbs shift between sheets. Good on days where I'm looking for a little extra verve without complication. 

7/10 I like this one! Spicy cardamom with a cozy base. I've already used up a lot of my sample. Recommend. 
___________________________
## Sybarite
**Expectations**
I got this on a whim! I didn't really even read the notes, just vibes. Probably the biggest thing I retained is that it is intended to be sexy without wearing too heavy

**Notes**
*red champaca absolute, red mandarin, a deeply sexy vanilla, red musk, and a blend of natural sandalwoods*

**Experience**
> This comes on gentle and pretty, and throughout the day it deepens and ever so slightly morphs into something truly fascinating to me. It feels airy & rich, playful & refined. Begins as a sweet, gentle, citrus-y nectar with swirls of incense. An hour or so in it shifts just a bit and smells like the most intriguing, slightly damp, pollen-filled floral. I've never smelled champaca in person, so to me what it most reminds me of is the scent of a honeysuckle or lilac bush drifting through the humid air of the mid-south US, even tho it's not quite either of those scents. I wonder how much my impression has been colored by testing this one in the spring.
>
> Abstractly, it feels gently orange, like filtered sunlight - suited for the long green shadows of the late morning and early summer evenings in a shaded yard. There's a feeling of dampness and life, youthfulness held in aged hands, fresh promise and maturity entertwined. Raindrops shaking from leaves after an afternoon shower, the feeling of being partially shadowed or enfolded such that something inside you opens and you feel free to laugh and play.
>
> The description says it is formulated to be diffusive despite the heavy notes and I find this to be absolutely true. As it wears throughout the day I get more of the vanilla and sandalwood. I'm also getting a little bit of that almost sour thing which makes me wonder if it might be the vanilla and sandalwood together that makes the effect?

8/10 - Sleeper hit for me, made me realize I love florals. Easily a fave from Cirrus & in the top few of any house I have tried so far. Highly recommend.

1ko2r9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1ko2r9r/what_is_a_french_bergère_chair/,What is a French Bergère chair?,"Samantha had always loved decorating her home with vintage and antique pieces, so when she moved into her new townhouse just outside of Charleston, she decided it was finally time to splurge on one really special chair for her reading nook. She didn’t know exactly what she was looking for—only that it had to feel elegant, cozy, and with a bit of character. That’s how she stumbled upon the term “French Bergère chair.”

It happened during a lazy Sunday morning, scrolling through Pinterest boards labeled “Parisian Interiors” and “French Country Style.” She kept seeing this particular kind of armchair pop up again and again—graceful, wide-seated, with curved wooden frames and thick cushions. Every caption seemed to read: *French Bergère*. Curious, she Googled it and found herself down a rabbit hole of interior design blogs and antique furniture forums.

Samantha learned that a Bergère chair is a type of French upholstered armchair that dates back to the 18th century. Originating in France during the reign of Louis XV, these chairs were designed to be not just elegant, but also deeply comfortable—something rare for that time. The key features? An exposed wooden frame, often carved with decorative flourishes, and a wide, deep seat with a plush, loose cushion. The arms are usually enclosed, sometimes upholstered, and the back can be rounded (known as *bergère en cabriolet*) or straight.

After reading about it, Samantha realized that she had seen these kinds of chairs before at estate sales and even in a couple of local antique shops, but had never paid much attention to the name. Now, though, she was hooked. She wanted one. But she didn’t want just any reproduction—she wanted a real vintage piece.

So she started looking around. She visited antique stores across town, chatted with shopkeepers, and even joined a Facebook group for vintage furniture lovers. That’s where she came across a woman named Claire, who was selling a mid-20th-century French Bergère chair that had belonged to her grandmother. The chair had a soft cream-colored upholstery and a beautifully aged oak frame with subtle carvings along the arms and legs.

When Samantha went to see it, it was love at first sight. The seat was deep and inviting, the back just the right height to lean into with a book, and the whole chair had that lived-in charm she had been craving. Claire even told her a bit about the chair’s history—how it had been brought over from Paris after World War II, and how her grandmother used to sit in it every morning with a cup of strong coffee.

Samantha bought the chair on the spot and brought it home. She placed it near the window in her reading nook, added a small table for her tea, and hung a soft linen curtain behind it. It became her favorite corner in the whole house.

In the end, her journey to find a French Bergère chair turned into much more than a furniture hunt. It taught her about a little piece of French history, introduced her to a new community of collectors, and gave her a connection to a stranger’s story. And now, every time she curled up in that chair with a novel, she felt like she had brought a little piece of Paris into her everyday life.",1,1747406961.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False
1ko2qvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1ko2qvn/complete_8k_modern_warpsychological_horror_debt/,[Complete] [8k] [Modern War/Psychological Horror] Debt,"A short story about Alan, a veteran of the Iraq war struggling with PTSD. He is progressively losing touch with reality, hounded by a mysterious debt collector between surreal nightmares and memories of his service. Tension builds as he faces his debt, slowly realizing that it isn't money he owes, and it is no ordinary debt collector he faces. This story is a glimpse into the spectrum of combat PTSD. Guilt, hatred, depression, and remorse culminate and crystallize into a confusing, nightmarish reality where Alan has to make a choice. 

Open to swapping, but would like to stay under 10k, and not really a fan of YA stuff (I'm old). I like horror, suspense, and war...also a fan of some sci-fi 

Here's a blurb, specifically illustrating the absurdity of mental ""care"" the military offers. It serves to build Alan's character:

“Have you witnessed anything that has given you lasting feelings of terror?”

“No.”

“Have you witnessed death, dying, or corpses; either enemy forces, civilians, or coalition?”

This one he had to think about. If they knew where he was on any given mission, they may know he was lying. 

“Yes.”

Alan could see the old man following his flow chart, flipping his stapled papers over. He peered through his glasses and clicked his pen to check a box. 

“Did this give you any lasting feelings of guilt, horror, or numbness?”, The old man asked, not looking up from his work. 

“I already told you no.”, Alan replied, exasperated. 

The evaluations continued in this way. Alan had been through so many of them he knew exactly what to say to make them end as quickly as possible. 

The process of gaining your separation from service in the military was a feat of strength and fortitude. One had to obtain a battery of stamps and signatures, sometimes from people and places that may or may not exist. One part of the process is a full medical and psychological evaluation. For this, Alan was sent to a clinic in an ancient and forgotten part of the base. He walked up to a set of World War II era barracks.

There was a lone sign perched in a manicured, pristine rectangle of grass. It read “Personnel Pre-Discharge Examination Center”, and in smaller type underneath, “Please stay off the grass”.  He opened the door, and noted that it was a door with a knob that turned. There was a sign instructing him to “Please, come in”, but still it made him feel awkward. He felt as if he were walking into someone else’s house without knocking. He was immediately stricken by the smell of antiquity that accompanies old buildings with hardwood floors; old lacquer and water damage. There was no one at the front desk, but there was a clipboard with a sign above it reading “Please Sign In”. He started to wonder if anyone actually worked here, or if they just left a series of signs that tell you what to do. He walked up to sign in, every step creaking and cracking on the timeworn hardwood floor. As he signed his name he noted that the sheet was empty. He creaked his way over to a stale couch, working his way between it and a coffee table smattered with copies of “People” magazine from the 80’s. Just as he was about to sit down he heard a faint voice from the hallway behind the desk. 

“Come on back.”

Alan knew the voice. As he rounded the desk he saw him. It was the same hunched over elderly man. He was rifling through papers; his head alternating between up and down, looking over and then through the glasses that were perched on the end of his nose. He wore a ratty, dark brown toupee that contrasted against his natural white hair around his ears. Alan had been quizzed by this old man so many times he could ask the questions *and* answer them. This was the last one, though. What would they do? Make him stay in longer? Actually, they would, but Alan didn’t know this at the time. He was tired of this old man and his flow charts. He would be genuinely honest.

1ko2qlg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ko2qlg,My Monster 620 Super - Update 3,"Si this is the update number 3 of the project and guys, we are almost there. The 800ie engine is here. The dry clutch mod is also already assembled on it. The ECU is here. After all of the blood and sweat thrown in searching the components and fixing all the possible hiccups, we are almost on the finish line of the project. The dry clutch cover is going to recall the coffee bean logo of Ducati of this era. 

This next monday (19th) the swap will commence, and I’ll also start the paint job, where I will repaint the bike in black with a red metallic finish, hoping that is going to be as wild as I’m imagining it. The last piece that is missing and that is actually quite hard to find are the adjustable front forks, or at least, in usable condition. 

Probably the most problematic thing to find, was the ECU, since I needed a IAW59M, which doesn’t have lambda sensor pins and it was mounted in the 800ie for a brief time in history (more or less 6 months). Mine is a IAW59A, which doesn’t have enough memory space to fit the whole map for the 800ie (since mine has 5 gears and the 800ie has 6).  

Does it have any economical sense to do any of this? No. I’ve could have bought 2 S4R with the money that I’ve sank into this project, but I’m certain that I am the only one in the world probably to have this bike. The last image is an Italian which roughly translates to:
“I’ll leave it stock because is more reliable”
“That’s why nobody is going to remember your name”

1ko2ptf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNtelligence/comments/1ko2ptf/the_best_ai_tools_for_validating_startup_ideas/,The Best AI Tools for Validating Startup Ideas (2025 Edition),"Ok devs and startup nerds, I just stumbled across what might be the ultimate cheat sheet for validating your next big (or mildly medium) startup idea in 2025—thanks AI overlords.

Apparently, there's this solid lineup of tools that let you test your concept without torching your wallet or free time. Perplexity AI handles deep-dive research like a caffeinated intern with a PhD. Then there's Fe-male Switch SANDBOX where you can build in a gamified world with your new AI BFF, PlayPal—yes, an AI co-founder… because that’s where we are now, folks.

You’ve also got AskGiraffe doing feasibility checks, EpicStart and PitchBob.io to make your pitch deck not look like it was made in MS Paint, and ZapStart for spinning up landing pages in a flash. Toolbuilder is all about no-code prototyping (bless), Strat.Chat for team brainstorms, and Hotball.ai pretending to be your executive team. Validately even helps you run tests with actual humans.

Question is—has anyone here actually used any of these? Are they legit or just shiny demos with cool branding? And are we getting closer to the day when an AI does the entire startup for us while we just sip coffee and wait for our Series A?

Rent is $3039 total in current apartment and available July 31 / August 1 or sooner for move-in! Let me know if you’re also interested in a single roommate for somewhere else, but I’d ideally stay in the area with a similar budget!

About me:

* I work remotely as a technical writer/editor for a government contractor (62k salary / 730 credit score).
* I like movies, books, working out, games, and comedy/improv!
* I am very clean, tidy, respectful, and value communication. 
* I am pretty chill but like going out with friends on weekends. 
* LGBTQ+ friendly!
* Allergic to pets :(

About the apartment:

* 3 rooms of various sizes (large, medium, small). Largest room has its own bathroom and closet and is currently inhabited by a couple (they’re moving). Medium room fits a queen bed and desk and has a closet. Smallest room is currently used as a living room/office with a small futon and two desks large desks but no closet.
* 1 year lease.
* Washer/dryer in building.
* Backyard and roof access.
* Utilities/wifi not included.
* Literally next to the M train stop, so it’s a little noisy.

If this sounds like a good fit, hit me up and we can chat or grab a coffee! Again, I’m more than open to moving somewhere else if you’re looking for roommate!",2,1747406717.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False
1ko2ndm,https://i.redd.it/i8h9tyq9p51f1.png,10DPO - This is your confirmation ^-^,"Hi! Long time lurker on this thread, and after a year I committed to Lap assisted vaginas hysterectomy/salpingectomy and cycstoscopy on May 6th. They basically took it all sans my ovaries, and checked my bladder for how my IC is doing. 

I'm currently 29, and was diagnosed in 2021 by laparocopy with stage 2 endometriosis/adenomyosis/intersistial cystitis. It took me awhile to come around to the idea of a hysterectomy because of my own emotional toll of having children (and not being able to) due to my circumstances. After years of therapy, I felt it was time and frankly, the pain was getting bad and I just keep thinking ""I'm not even 30 and I have this much pain.. what will it be like even 10 years, 20 years, down the road.""

I'm currently 10DPO and I wanted to send good vibes to the other lurkers who are concerned about post op - you got this fr. I understand everyone's experience is different, and I just want to help push along the positive posts too, that at less than 2 weeks from surgery I feel like my: 

- anxiety is at an all time low.
- My IC has been *knock on wood* nonexistent and I feel like my bladder now has room. 
- I only take a 300mg gabapentin a day with stool softeners (and don't skip out on the latter, whatever you do lol).
- I have minor pain by the end of the day, and nothing near to the pain of having periods. 

This is getting long - my bad - I just want to give a few more things that I believe really helped me with recovery thus far: 

- I had been in pelvic floor PT for 3 months prior to surgery.
- I work(ed) out for at least 30 minutes (we're talking at home workouts, with resistance bands and my own body weight) M - F and yoga every day. 
- I eat mostly a Mediterranean/pescatarian diet (but don't get it twisted, I am a sucker for junk food). 
- I don't drink coffee/alcohol, and stick to mostly herbal teas + water. 

Anywho. I'm saying that though I wish I could've had this done sooner, I am also grateful for the time I took to mentally and emotionally get to this point. Now, I feel at peace, at ease, and on my way to taking the reigns of my life again. I hope you can someday too.

It's my first post and English is my second language, so please excuse my mistakes.
I (F 32) was diagnosed with a brain tumour one year ago. At first, I didn't take it seriously, as the tumour didn't cause any symptoms (it was discovered by chance) and the doctors told me I can't die of it and the treatment usually doesn't take too long and isn't too bad. 
So I told my friends, family and bosses after a while, because I felt like I had to, but I am in general a person that doesn't like to talk on a deep emotional level and I probably made it all sound even less serious. Unfortunately, the last year has been really hard. The treatment does work, but a lot more slowly than expected. At the moment, the tumour is too big to have surgery as the risks of other damage is too high. So I have to keep taking the medication that I've been taking for a year now, and in contrast to the tumour not causing any symbols, the medication does. I am super tired, don't have much energy in general, often feel nauseous or have to vomit, don't have any appetite, smells and tastes are often a problem which makes me eat very badly (often only bread or bananas) and basically everything where I'd need by brain (like thinking in general (lol), engaging in deeper conversations, reading, learning new things, etc) often doesn't work, so most of the time I'm just watching TV or drawing. I've also put on a few kilos and lost a lot of muscles (I was really sporty before and it was a big part of my self-perception). I don't make many plans anymore as quite often, I have to cancel them because I don't have the energy to go out. My doctors understand how hard it is but there's no other option. They told me I can stay at home (in my country and my job I'd still be paid 100% for up to three years) and not work at all, but I don't want that because I think I'd then lose kind of everything that I have left to give me some structure and something to do and think about. I'm now working part-time which is sometimes exhausting, but fine for me.

I am married and my husband supports me wherever he can. My and his family are also always there for us and help us a lot, sometimes cooking for us and so on. I used to have a lot of friends (a really close friend group outside of work and a group of colleagues I'd also consider friends). Both my colleague-friends and my close friends always say that they're always there for me and I can always count on them, but to be honest, it doesn't feel like it sometimes. As I said, maybe it's also my own fault, because especially right after I got the diagnosis I played it down a bit. But since then, I've told them that I'm struggling and they also know my symptoms and that I'm only working part-time. They rarely reach out and they rarely ask how I am, and when they do, I feel like they're getting bored of me telling them the same thing all the time... Which I get, because it's not positive and it's kind of always the same, but I just wish they'd be there a bit more, maybe just asking if I'd like to go for a walk, or have a coffee together, or something else. I don't know if I'm asking for too much, I just feel like a burden and try to avoid the topic in general now because I feel like I'm just annoying them...

What would you do? Keep avoiding the topic? Talking openly about how I feel? Is it okay to ask directly for them to be there a bit more? They all have their own lives, their own problems, their own relationships, so maybe I just have to accept that I feel lonely sometimes.",2,1747406471.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I've been on the carnivore diet since May 7th. I was losing very little and got the keto/carnivore flu until day 6 where I felt good. Since day 6, I've basically gained back a pound a day. I'm actually heavier than what I started now.  I'm not overeating. I'm undereating.  I track my food and I do a lot of chicken and pork and ground beef.

I've read through the posts and I'm cutting out coffee which I did have with full cream or a no sugar creamer. I'm also cutting out cheese. And I know I screwed up on the beef jerky already. 

My question is:  I'm gaining weight on the scale, but also according to my scale I have also gained 2 lbs of muscle in 5 days. Is this ok?  Also, I am not exercising. I walk maybe 3000 steps a day. I've had surgery on my gut a year ago and I'm taking it easy as part of my colon was removed and the area where it was put back together hurts when food passes through it.  Since being on carnivore though I've had really good results with this area and what follows.

I plan on just doing carnivore with meat and eggs only and see if I can start losing weight too.  I'm a simple eater. Bacon and eggs at lunch time and then dinner at 5 pm with just some meat.

I’m looking for a new, preferably public sector job and it seems like they have a rare state government that is actually hiring a lot of people right now. I’m just curious if it’s a fit personality wise. 

I’ll just get to my big concern off the bat: I don’t drink alcohol and have no interest in the bar hopping scene. Seems like that’s one of the primary social activities, especially for younger people. I have heard from people in places like Nashville who have said there isn’t much to do outside the bar scene and I worry Austin might be similar in that regard.

Some stuff I do like: nature walks, museums, coffee shops, baseball games, lounging at the pool, intramural sports, and more low key, non-alcohol centered events in general. Generally things that are super crowded or have lots of loud music aren’t really my thing. 

Also, I know it gets hot and humid in the summer, how does it compare to Raleigh or Charlotte. I’m in NC right now and really don’t mind our summers, yeah it’s humid, but worth it to get all the green IMO. If anyone has lived in both places that would be helpful insight.

I’m aware of the Texas state politics. To put it bluntly, I’m (white male) not exactly in a marginalized community and not planning on having kids anytime soon (wouldn’t even consider it if I was), so it’s not a big concern for me atm. Plus, Austin is pretty blue from what I understand. Please don’t use poor state politics as a reason not to move there, unless I’m missing something big.  

Thanks in advance for the thoughtful responses!

1ko2hnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beds_/comments/1ko2hnf/do_bed_sheets_make_a_difference_in_sleep_quality/,Do bed sheets make a difference in sleep quality?,"Jenna had always considered herself a “decent sleeper.” She usually got around six or seven hours a night, but she never woke up feeling truly rested. Her mornings often started with groggy eyes, a stiff neck, and a strong cup of coffee to push through the day. She figured it was just part of adult life—everyone was tired, right?

One day, while scrolling through a home and lifestyle forum, she came across a thread titled *“Do your bed sheets actually affect your sleep?”* At first, she laughed. How could sheets matter that much? She thought people were just being picky. But the more she read, the more curious she got. Dozens of users talked about switching to higher quality sheets—ones made of breathable cotton, bamboo, or linen—and how it surprisingly improved their sleep. Some mentioned feeling cooler at night, others talked about fewer wake-ups, and many said they woke up more refreshed.

Jenna decided to experiment. Her current sheets were cheap microfiber ones she’d picked up on sale a year ago—soft enough, but definitely not breathable. She spent a weekend researching and eventually ordered a set of 100% cotton percale sheets after reading they were crisp, cool, and ideal for hot sleepers.

When the new sheets arrived, she noticed the difference immediately. They felt lighter and more breathable. That first night, she didn’t expect much, but to her surprise, she fell asleep faster than usual and didn’t wake up in the middle of the night, which she often did without realizing. Over the next week, she kept track of her sleep. She was waking up before her alarm, and for the first time in a long while, she felt alert in the mornings—no pounding headache, no dragging herself to the coffee pot.

It wasn’t a miracle cure, but it was a noticeable improvement. Jenna realized her old sheets had been trapping heat and making her slightly uncomfortable without her fully registering it. The switch made her sleep environment more pleasant, which made a difference in how deeply she slept.

Now, she recommends it to anyone who complains about poor sleep. “Start with your sheets,” she says. “It sounds small, but it might be the easiest change you can make.”

1ko2eow,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1ko2eow/addendum_to_emergency_protocol_47k/,Addendum to Emergency Protocol 47-K,"Another story in the GC universe!

If you like this, there are lots more. You can find them in the modbot comment below.

---

The walls of Room 17B were the same dull gray they’d always been, unchanged through administrations, minor internal conflicts, and the brief yet memorable “Chair Rebellion” of five years prior. The lighting buzzed with just enough inconsistency to induce migraines but not complaints, and the oxygen filters wheezed with the reluctant sigh of a machine forced to bear witness.

Today’s agenda was unambitious: routine review of outdated safety protocols. Namely, Emergency Protocol 47-K, which governed proper procedures during a catastrophic reactor breach aboard any Confederation-aligned vessel. The protocol had not been meaningfully revised in thirty-seven years. Most expected this meeting to conclude with some gentle language changes—perhaps clarifying that “rapid egress” meant within ten seconds and not within ten minutes, as had been misinterpreted in a now-famous case involving a melted coffee cart and a missing lieutenant.

The chair of the Oversight Committee, Commissioner Traln, had only just begun reading aloud the first bullet of the briefing document when the phrase “attached: incident report, CNS Pigeon” shifted the room’s attention from passive disinterest to active concern. The Pigeon was, technically speaking, a human vessel. This alone elevated the risk factor of the review by at least 40%. The rest of the file—messy, uneven, a mixture of typewritten lines and what appeared to be smudged pen—was not standard formatting.

One page contained a hand-drawn diagram in red ink. Another included a list of materials, among them “one reinforced toaster housing,” “four meters of impact gel tubing,” and “hope.” Page four had a suspicious grease smear labeled ""not blood,"" which caused the assistant archivist to excuse themselves for a full minute.

The incident, as pieced together from the report and a follow-up clarifying communique (“Sorry it’s a bit rough. We were on the move”), was straightforward in only the most clinical sense.

The Pigeon, a human multipurpose frigate operating just outside the regulated border zones, had experienced a full reactor destabilization event. This had occurred—according to the report’s own words—during “a highly theoretical, moderately inebriated” overclocking experiment aimed at “pushing range efficiency by at least 7%, maybe 9% if the stars were feeling generous.”

The initial telemetry from the ship’s last check-in showed rapid temperature escalation, core containment failure, and the activation of multiple emergency beacons. In response, Fleet Command issued an immediate Class-1 Evacuation Order and locked surrounding sectors under safety protocols.

What happened next was, by all known standards of safety, engineering, and common sense, inadvisable.

The crew of the Pigeon chose not to evacuate.

The reasons given in the report ranged from “seemed like a waste of time” to “we’d just restocked the ship’s bar.” The chief engineer, in a footnote, added: “Also, the evac shuttle smells weird and keeps making ominous clicking noises.”

Instead of fleeing, the crew opted to initiate a manual ejection of the unstable reactor core. This alone was notable, as mid-flight core ejection had only ever been attempted twice in recorded history. Both previous attempts had ended in catastrophic failure and, in one case, spontaneous combustion of the surrounding legal documents.

According to the timeline pieced together by analysts, the Pigeon’s crew used manual override systems to realign the ship’s hull along what they estimated to be the “cleanest ejection vector.” They then braced all major stabilizers, redistributed their power network, and physically disconnected non-critical systems to prevent a full cascade failure.

Approximately twenty-three seconds before projected core detonation, the reactor was ejected from the vessel at close range.

It exploded.

The detonation created a shockwave that, under normal circumstances, would have atomized any ship within a thousand kilometers. However, due to the Pigeon’s realignment, stabilizer configuration, and, by several analysts' begrudging agreement, sheer dumb luck, the vessel managed to ride the shockwave.

As in: they used the explosive force to slingshot themselves out of the danger zone.

The data showed the Pigeon traveling across 2.6 light-minutes of space in less than eighteen seconds. The maneuver registered on a dozen long-range observatories and cracked the sensors of two unmanned satellites. One recorded the audio of the crew screaming, not in terror, but apparently with giddy exhilaration. A fragment of the log transmitted later simply read: “YEEEEEAAAAHHHHH.”

When recovered by Confederation scouts three days later, the Pigeon was badly scorched, missing part of its rear antenna, and venting pressure from a breach in one of its lesser cargo compartments (contents listed as “board games and trail mix”). But the ship remained functional. Every crew member survived.

Injuries were limited to a few first-degree burns, a mild concussion, and one sprained ankle reportedly incurred during “a celebratory impromptu dance-off.”

The crew’s own summary, filed under the line item “Conclusion,” read as follows:

“A bit dicey, honestly. Wouldn’t recommend without a lot of prep and a healthy disregard for mortality. Still, kind of fun in a dumb way. Engineering’s going to try to refine the timing if this ever happens again. Or, you know, maybe we just won’t push the reactor next time. Probably.”

The Oversight Committee sat in stunned silence for a full minute after the final page was read.

Commissioner Traln set the papers down and, without irony, asked aloud: “Is... any of that even technically illegal?”

No one answered. One member slowly reached for a datapad to begin logging potential amendments to Protocol 47-K.


Commissioner Traln broke the silence, adjusting his headlamp with a slow, defeated gesture. “Let the record show we are now entering discussion regarding Emergency Protocol 47-K, in light of... the report.”

There was a shuffle of data slates. Someone coughed. Another member tentatively raised a tentacle.

“Yes, Councilor Reshk?” Traln said, his voice heavy with fatigue.

Reshk stared at his notes. “I would like to formally propose the classification of the Pigeon incident as... theoretical nonsense made real.”

A few members murmured agreement. One simply nodded and muttered, “It’s the only category that fits.”

Councilor Meln, a small aquatic being sitting in a portable water tank, adjusted her speaking valve and said, “We cannot let this stand. The maneuver was—by any reasonable standard—reckless, insane, and probably criminal. I propose we move to officially ban shockwave riding as a recognized emergency tactic under Fleet regulations.”

Commissioner Traln looked around the room. “Any seconds on that motion?”

Several limbs went up—tentacles, paws, and at least one gloved claw.

“Noted. Discussion opens—”

The door hissed open with a distinctly casual whoosh. The human liaison officer walked in, fifteen minutes late and absolutely unbothered. He was wearing standard GC-issue trousers, a stained crew jacket that definitely wasn’t standard, and a pair of sunglasses on his forehead despite the complete absence of sunlight in the room or, indeed, this entire sector of space. He was holding a large beverage that emitted steam and a faint smell of synthetic caramel.

Everyone turned to stare.

He blinked at them, took another sip, and slowly sat in the nearest chair, which squealed under him in protest. He spun it backward and straddled it like an instructor in a holodrama trying to relate to troubled youths.

“Sorry I’m late,” he said, not sounding sorry at all. “Transit was weird.”

“Human liaison,” Traln said slowly, pressing his digits together, “we are reviewing an incident involving the CNS Pigeon. You’ve seen the report?”

“Yup.” Sip. “Good read.”

“We were just discussing whether what they did constitutes a gross violation of emergency protocol, basic engineering principles, and common sense.”

“Right,” the human said. “Yeah, that tracks.”

There was a long pause as several committee members processed that response.

“Just to clarify,” Meln said slowly, “the crew of the Pigeon ejected their reactor core mid-flight, timed it to detonate at just the right moment, and then used the resulting explosion to propel themselves out of a gravitational well?”

“More or less,” said the human.

“And you’re confirming this is... accurate?”

He shrugged. “I mean, the details are a little fuzzy, but yeah. That’s what happened.”

Meln’s gills flared. “How is that not a complete breakdown of operational discipline?”

“Look,” the human said, leaning forward on his chair. “It’s not standard protocol. We don’t teach it at the academy or anything. But it’s not unheard of either. You eject the core, it explodes, you ride the blast. Classic maneuver in certain circles.”

“Classic?” Traln repeated. “You’re telling me this is a classic maneuver?”

“Sure. Timing’s the hard part. Execution’s mostly instinct and caffeine.”

The silence that followed was less stunned and more existential. One member of the committee—Councilor Djik, who had served forty-three years as a Fleet logistics analyst—let out a soft groan and dropped their head to the table.

“I... I must ask,” another member said, rubbing at their temple with a bioluminescent appendage, “does this not violate every known safety protocol in the Fleet?”

The human took another sip of his drink, nodded thoughtfully, and said, “Only if you care about those.”

A strangled noise came from somewhere near the room’s ventilation panel.

Commissioner Traln rubbed his eye ridge. “And you’re saying this wasn’t... a mistake?”

“Oh, it was definitely a mistake,” the human replied. “Just not the bad kind.”

The committee stared at him. He stared back with the relaxed air of someone who had long ago stopped expecting alien diplomats to understand human behavior and had instead chosen to simply let the results speak for themselves.

Traln cleared his throat. “Very well. Motion to ban the maneuver is suspended. Instead, I propose we add an appendix to Protocol 47-K.”

No one protested.

“Appendix D: Human-Class Improvisational Maneuvers.”

Councilor Reshk whispered, “Spirits help us.”

“The entry will read: Core-Ejection Shockwave Propulsion. Labeled: Not recommended. Not repeatable. Not technically prohibited.”

There were reluctant nods across the room.

“Any other annotations?” Traln asked.

Meln, staring bleakly at the human, muttered, “We should probably include a warning.”

Commissioner Traln dictated aloud for the record:

“CNS Pigeon incident not to be used as precedent—unless it works again.”

The human liaison gave a casual thumbs-up.

The motion passed without further debate. Everyone knew they were going to need another protocol meeting soon. Probably several. Probably about other human ships doing even worse things.

No one brought up the CNS Duckling, currently under investigation for “alleged railgun surfing.” That was a problem for future meetings.

Or for future appendices.

1ko2cze,https://www.reddit.com/r/askaustin/comments/1ko2cze/considering_potential_move_curious_about_fit/,"Considering potential move, curious about fit","As title says, I’m (23M) considering a potential move to Austin. I’m looking for a new job and it seems like they have a rare state government that is actually hiring a lot of people right now. I’m just curious if it’s a fit personality. 

I’ll just get to my big concern off the bat: I don’t drink alcohol and have no interest in the bar hopping scene. Seems like that’s one of the primary social activities, especially for younger people. I have heard from people in places like Nashville who have said there isn’t much to do outside the bar scene and I worry Austin might be similar in that regard. 

Some stuff I do like: nature walks, museums, coffee shops, baseball games, lounging at the pool, intramural sports, and more low key, non-alcohol centered events in general. 

Also, I know it gets hot and humid in the summer, how does it compare to Raleigh or Charlotte. I’m in NC right now and really don’t mind our summers, yeah it’s humid, but worth it to get all the green IMO. If anyone has lived in both places that would be helpful insight.

1ko2bne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolTracker/comments/1ko2bne/boostyourcampaign_ai_agent_ever_wonder_how_an_ai/,BoostYourCampaign AI Agent: Ever Wonder How an AI Social Media Agent for Crowdfunding Gets Built?,"So, we all know AI is (slowly) eating the world? And if you're in the crowdfunding space, or just fascinated by cool AI applications, you've probably seen how AI tools are starting to make a real dent in how campaigns are run. I was recently looking into services that help crowdfunding projects, and I stumbled upon something pretty neat from the team at [BoostYourCampaign.com](http://BoostYourCampaign.com), known for helping Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects, but what caught my eye was their use of AI, specifically an AI-powered agent to help manage and supercharge social media marketing for campaigns.

It’s not just about scheduling posts anymore; we're talking about an AI that can help with the whole shebang – from brainstorming killer post ideas that resonate with a target audience, to drafting compelling copy that converts, and then, yeah, still handling the smart scheduling across different platforms. For anyone who's ever tried to run a crowdfunding campaign, you know that social media can be a massive time-sink, but it's also absolutely crucial for getting the word out and building a community. Having an AI assistant that can take on a lot of the heavy lifting here sounds like a dream, especially for small teams or solo creators.

BoostYourCampaign mentioned that this AI agent is a service they offer to help their clients get a serious edge. Imagine feeding an AI details about your unique project – say, a new tabletop RPG, sneakers, or an indie film – and having it help you craft a social media strategy. It could analyze trending topics relevant to your niche, suggest content pillars, and even help you maintain a consistent voice and posting schedule when you're swamped with, you know, actually making the thing you're crowdfunding!

This got me super curious. It's one thing to hear about these tools, but I always want to peek under the hood. How does something like this actually work, well, I thought it would be cool to break down, step-by-step, how one might go about building a similar AI social media agent. We're talking a conceptual blueprint here, but with enough detail that you can see the moving parts.

So, in the next part of this post, I’m going to dive into a hypothetical build for an AI social media agent designed for crowdfunding campaigns. We'll touch on the kinds of programming languages you might use (Python is a big contender here, obviously), the AI models involved (think Large Language Models - LLMs), and the logic behind making it useful for things like:

1. Generating Creative Post Ideas: How can AI help break through writer's block and suggest engaging content?

2. Crafting Compelling Copy: Moving beyond generic posts to writing persuasive calls to action and updates.

3. Smart Scheduling & Platform Adaptation: Optimizing when and how content is shared.

This is going to be a bit of a deep dive, so grab a coffee! My aim is to make it understandable even if you're not a hardcore coder, but still meaty enough for those who are. Stay tuned for the breakdown below!



The Step-by-Step Breakdown: Building an AI Social Media Agent for Crowdfunding

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how a company like BoostYourCampaign might build an AI social media agent specifically designed for crowdfunding campaigns. This is based on my understanding of AI systems and what would make sense for this use case.

Step 1: Setting Up the Foundation (The Tech Stack)

First things first, you need a solid foundation. Here's what the tech stack might look like:



Programming Languages & Frameworks:

\* Python as the primary language (it's the go-to for AI development due to its extensive libraries)

\* FastAPI or Flask for creating the API endpoints that will serve as the interface between users and the AI

\* JavaScript/TypeScript with React or Vue.js for the frontend dashboard where users interact with the agent

\* PostgreSQL or MongoDB for the database to store campaign details, generated content, and analytics



AI Components:

\* A fine-tuned version of an LLM like GPT-4 or an open-source alternative like Llama 2 or Mistral as the core language model

\* Hugging Face Transformers library for implementing and managing the models

\* LangChain for building the agent's reasoning capabilities and connecting different components



The system would likely be deployed on cloud infrastructure like AWS or Google Cloud Platform, with containerization via Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes to ensure scalability during peak campaign periods.



Step 2: Data Collection & Knowledge Base Creation

Before the AI can generate meaningful content, it needs to understand crowdfunding and social media marketing. This involves:

1. Creating a specialized knowledge base about crowdfunding best practices, platform-specific strategies (Kickstarter vs. Indiegogo), and successful campaign examples

2. Collecting and analyzing social media data from successful campaigns across different categories (tech, games, art, etc.)

3. Building a taxonomy of post types that work well for crowdfunding (e.g., progress updates, backer spotlights, stretch goal announcements)

4. Developing a sentiment analysis system to understand audience reactions to different content types



This data would be processed, cleaned, and structured to serve as the foundation for the AI's understanding of what works in crowdfunding social media.



Step 3: Campaign Onboarding & Customization System

For the AI to be truly useful, it needs to understand the specific campaign it's working with. The onboarding process might look like:

1. Campaign questionnaire that collects key information:

\* Campaign category and subcategory

\* Target audience demographics and psychographics

\* Unique selling propositions and key features

\* Brand voice guidelines (casual, professional, quirky, etc.)

\* Campaign timeline with key milestones

\* Existing social media accounts and their performance metrics

2. Content asset collection:

\* Campaign images and videos

\* Product descriptions and specifications

\* Team bios and background

\* FAQs and common objections

3. Fine-tuning process:

4. The system would use this information to customize its outputs specifically for this campaign, essentially ""learning"" the campaign's voice and priorities.



Step 4: Building the Post Idea Generator



Now we get to the fun part! The post idea generator would likely use a combination of techniques:

1. Prompt engineering to create specialized prompts that guide the LLM to generate relevant post ideas based on:

\* Campaign stage (pre-launch, early funding, mid-campaign, final push)

\* Platform-specific content strategies (Instagram vs. Twitter vs. Facebook)

\* Content pillars identified for the campaign

2. Template-based generation with slots for campaign-specific details:pythontemplates = \[

3.     ""Behind the scenes: {team\_activity} as we prepare for launch!"",

4.     ""Q&A: {common\_question} about our {product\_name}"",

5.     ""Meet the team: {team\_member\_name}, our {team\_role}"",

6.     # Many more templates...

7. \]

8. Content calendar awareness to suggest timely posts:

\* Countdown posts as launch approaches

\* Milestone celebration posts (25%, 50%, 100% funded)

\* Weekend engagement boosters

\* Responses to trending topics relevant to the campaign



10. Competitive analysis module that suggests post ideas based on what's working for similar campaigns

The code might look something like:

python



def generate\_post\_ideas(campaign\_data, campaign\_stage, platform, count=5):

\# Construct a prompt based on campaign data and stage

prompt = f""""""

Generate {count} creative social media post ideas for a {campaign\_data\['category'\]} 

crowdfunding campaign on {platform}. The campaign is currently in the {campaign\_stage} stage.



Campaign details:

\- Name: {campaign\_data\['name'\]}

\- Key features: {', '.join(campaign\_data\['key\_features'\])}

\- Target audience: {campaign\_data\['target\_audience'\]}

\- Brand voice: {campaign\_data\['brand\_voice'\]}



For each idea, provide:

1. A catchy headline

2. The main content focus

3. Suggested visual elements

4. Call to action

""""""



\# Send to the LLM

response = llm\_client.generate(prompt=prompt, max\_tokens=1000)



\# Process and structure the response

ideas = parse\_ideas(response.text)



\# Filter ideas against previously used content to ensure freshness

ideas = filter\_for\_uniqueness(ideas, campaign\_data\['previous\_posts'\])



return ideas



Step 5: Developing the Copy Generation System



Once you have ideas, you need to turn them into actual copy. This system would:

1. Take a selected post idea and expand it into full social media copy

2. Adapt the tone and style to match the campaign's brand voice

3. Optimize for platform-specific requirements (character limits, hashtag usage, etc.)

4. Include campaign-specific calls to action based on the current funding stage



The copy generator would likely use a more sophisticated prompt structure with examples of good crowdfunding posts to guide the LLM:

python



def generate\_post\_copy(idea, campaign\_data, platform):

\# Get platform-specific constraints

constraints = PLATFORM\_CONSTRAINTS\[platform\]



\# Construct a detailed prompt with examples

prompt = f""""""

Write compelling social media copy for {platform} based on this idea: ""{idea\['headline'\]}"".



Campaign context:

\- Campaign name: {campaign\_data\['name'\]}

\- Current funding: {campaign\_data\['current\_funding'\]}% of goal

\- Campaign stage: {campaign\_data\['stage'\]}

\- Brand voice: {campaign\_data\['brand\_voice'\]}



The copy should:

\- Be within {constraints\['max\_length'\]} characters

\- Include {constraints\['optimal\_hashtag\_count'\]} relevant hashtags

\- Match this brand voice example: ""{campaign\_data\['voice\_example'\]}""

\- Include a clear call to action to {get\_appropriate\_cta(campaign\_data)}



Here are two examples of successful {platform} posts for crowdfunding campaigns:



Example 1:

{get\_example\_post(platform, campaign\_data\['category'\], 1)}



Example 2:

{get\_example\_post(platform, campaign\_data\['category'\], 2)}

""""""



\# Generate the copy

response = llm\_client.generate(prompt=prompt, max\_tokens=constraints\['max\_tokens'\])



\# Post-process to ensure platform compliance

processed\_copy = post\_process\_copy(response.text, constraints)



return processed\_copy



Step 6: Building the Scheduling Intelligence



Smart scheduling is crucial for maximizing engagement. The scheduling system would:

1. Analyze historical engagement data from the campaign's social accounts

2. Identify optimal posting times based on:

\* Target audience activity patterns

\* Platform-specific peak engagement windows

\* Time zones of the primary backer demographics

\* Content type (e.g., updates might perform better at different times than behind-the-scenes content)

3. Implement a content calendar that balances:

\* Frequency (avoiding both under-posting and spamming)

\* Content variety (mixing different post types)

\* Campaign milestones and events

4. Provide a queue management system that allows for human review before posts go live



The scheduling algorithm might look something like:

python



def determine\_optimal\_posting\_time(post\_type, platform, campaign\_data):

\# Get audience activity patterns

audience\_patterns = get\_audience\_activity(campaign\_data\['analytics'\], platform)



\# Get platform-specific optimal windows

platform\_windows = PLATFORM\_OPTIMAL\_TIMES\[platform\]



\# Get content type timing preferences

content\_timing = CONTENT\_TYPE\_TIMING\[post\_type\]



\# Calculate the intersection of these factors

candidate\_times = \[\]

for day in next\_seven\_days():

for hour in range(24):

score = calculate\_timing\_score(

day, 

hour, 

audience\_patterns, 

platform\_windows, 

content\_timing

)

candidate\_times.append((day, hour, score))



\# Sort by score and return top options

candidate\_times.sort(key=lambda x: x\[2\], reverse=True)

return candidate\_times\[:3\]  # Return top 3 options



Step 7: Feedback Loop & Continuous Improvement



What makes this AI agent truly powerful is its ability to learn and improve over time:

1. Performance tracking of each post:

\* Engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)

\* Click-through rates to the campaign page

\* Conversion rates to backers

\* Sentiment analysis of comments

2. A/B testing framework to systematically test:

\* Different post formats

\* Various calls to action

\* Posting times

\* Content themes

3. Reinforcement learning to gradually improve the agent's recommendations based on what actually works for each specific campaign



The system would update its internal models based on this feedback:

python



def update\_campaign\_model(campaign\_id, post\_results):

\# Get the campaign's current model

campaign\_model = get\_campaign\_model(campaign\_id)



\# Extract performance data

high\_performing\_posts = \[p for p in post\_results if p\['engagement\_score'\] > THRESHOLD\]

low\_performing\_posts = \[p for p in post\_results if p\['engagement\_score'\] <= THRESHOLD\]



\# Update the model's understanding of what works

for post in high\_performing\_posts:

campaign\_model.reinforce\_patterns(

post\_type=post\['type'\],

content\_elements=post\['content\_elements'\],

timing=post\['posting\_time'\],

platform=post\['platform'\]

)



\# Learn from what doesn't work as well

for post in low\_performing\_posts:

campaign\_model.reduce\_pattern\_weight(

post\_type=post\['type'\],

content\_elements=post\['content\_elements'\],

timing=post\['posting\_time'\],

platform=post\['platform'\]

)

 

\# Save the updated model

save\_campaign\_model(campaign\_id, campaign\_model)



Step 8: Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration

Finally, the system would be designed to work collaboratively with human marketers:

1. Approval workflows for reviewing and editing AI-generated content

2. Suggestion mode where the AI provides options rather than making final decisions

3. Learning from edits made by human marketers to improve future suggestions

4. Hybrid creation tools that allow humans to start a post and have the AI help complete it



This human-AI collaboration ensures the best of both worlds: the efficiency and data-processing power of AI combined with human creativity and judgment.



The Real-World Impact

From what I understand about BoostYourCampaign's approach, their AI social media agent isn't just a cool tech toy—it's a practical tool that delivers real results for crowdfunding campaigns:

\* Time savings: Campaign creators report spending 70-80% less time on social media management

\* Increased engagement: AI-optimized posts typically see 30-40% higher engagement rates

\* Better conversion: The targeted approach leads to more qualified traffic to campaign pages

\* Consistent presence: Campaigns maintain an active social presence even when creators are swamped with other aspects of their launch

The most impressive part is how the AI adapts to each unique campaign. It's not just spitting out generic ""crowdfunding content""—it's learning the specific voice, features, and audience of each project to create truly customized social media strategies.

**Final Thoughts**

What I find most fascinating is how this represents a shift from using AI for basic automation (like scheduling) to actually augmenting human creativity and strategy. The AI isn't replacing marketers; it's giving them superpowers by handling the repetitive aspects and providing data-driven insights that humans might miss.

If you're running a crowdfunding campaign and struggling with the social media aspect, services like what BoostYourCampaign offers could be worth looking into. Or if you're a developer interested in AI applications, this kind of specialized agent represents an interesting case study in applying general-purpose AI models to specific business domains.

Anyone else here working on similar AI tools for specific marketing niches?

1ko2avr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PDAAutism/comments/1ko2avr/thought_awareness_and_embodiment/,Thought awareness and embodiment,"This post might be limited by my own observations, but does anyone else find it not the most peculiar or strange that an autistic person can observe an interaction from the outside, and adequately point out whether there are violations to certain norms, or whether someone says something inappropriate, or what the vibe is in the conversation, or how curious people really are in one another, etc. BUT as soon as the autistic person is part of the interaction, the autistic person is not able to act in that way himself.

Like the person cannot make sure he doesn’t make any of the social mistakes/deviations he can detect in interactions from the outside.

This is my thinking, but I think there is something going on with a lack of awareness on a thought level about what the impact is of their thoughts on the interaction.

Take the extreme case of having the ability to pause an interaction, and to observe each and every thought and how they shape your behavior and thus the interaction.

You could be having a coffee with someone, and for example pause at a moment where you are having an a thought like ‘Ok I don’t know what this person thinks of what I just said?’. 

And if you pause there, and let those thoughts sink in, on a body level (feel it with your gut), you realise how strange having this thoughts is for the interaction, but we probably are so used to these kind of thoughts by now.

It seems that every thought, has bearing on the interaction.

Like if you were to stop the coffee conversation for every thought you have, and you had the time to see how each thought will likely influence the interaction because of its content. 

If you have thoughts like ‘this is getting super boring’, you realise that that is a thought you better shouldn’t act on straight away if you don’t want to be inappropriate. And instead your next thought could be ‘let me just entertain this topic passively until the conversation naturally shifts’ as a thought that drives behavior adaptively.

A next thought could be ‘I am really hungry’ and again the adaptive follow up thought could be ‘it’s only 10 am and people will likely have assumed I ate breakfast’

But I think there is a problem in that interactions go so fast, and there are a tremendous amount of anxious masking related thoughts, or racing thoughts in general that make you unable to become aware of how each thought has an impact on the interaction.

Just some thoughts, but it feels like an awareness of one’s thoughts and how they shape your own behavior and thus the interaction could be missing in autistic people, and where masking is actually a form of lack of awareness on a body level of each thought.",1,1747405833.0,PDAAutism,0,1.0,False

Canada’s [New Tariffs on US Drop](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/canada-s-new-tariffs-on-us-drop-to-nearly-zero-with-exemptions-oxford-says/ar-AA1ELXf1) to ‘Nearly Zero’ With Exemptions, Oxford Says. Canada has effectively suspended almost all of its retaliatory tariffs on US products, tamping down inflation risks and improving its growth outlook, according to Oxford Economics.  The government imposed new import taxes of 25% on about C$60 billion ($43 billion) of US-made goods in March in response to the first round of tariffs from the Trump administration. Canada also retaliated against US auto tariffs in early April by putting its own levies on US vehicles. But Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government then announced a six-month tariff exemption for products used in Canadian manufacturing, processing and food and beverage packaging, and for items related to health care, public safety and national security. Automakers got a break, too: companies that manufacture in Canada, such as General Motors Co., are allowed to import some vehicles into Canada tariff-free. “It’s a very strategic approach from a new prime minister to really say, ‘We’re not going to have a retaliation,’” Tony Stillo, Oxford’s director of Canada economics, said in an interview. “It’s a strategic play on the government’s part to not damage the Canadian economy.” Retaliatory tariffs on some US goods remain, including on food items such as orange juice, alcohol and coffee, as well as clothing and cosmetics.

B.C. premier announces [trade mission to Asia](https://www.biv.com/news/economy-law-politics/bc-premier-announces-trade-mission-to-asia-but-not-to-china-10662302) but not to China. Premier David Eby announced Wednesday he and Minister of Agriculture and Food Lana Popham will be going on a trade mission to Asia as part of its effort to diversify trade away from the United States amid threats of tariffs on local products. Eby said the mission will visit Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. Eby announced the mission at Finest at Sea, a local seafood processor at Point Hope Shipyard in Victoria. While the mission will include Popham, Eby said it will not focus primarily on seafood and agriculture exports. Eby said measuring success of the trip will be in the relationships. ""It is to let them know we value their business and partnerships, and we are keen to work with them,” said Eby, adding there is importance in seeking “jurisdictions that are stable.” Eby did not mention China in his initial announcement, instead focusing on the U.S. relationship vis-a-vis President Donald Trump.

""If the Canadian federal government removes the tariffs on Chinese products, China can also adjust its policies,” he said. China in March levied a 100 per cent tariff on Canadian canola oil and meal and a 25 per cent levy on pork and some seafood as a result of an anti-dumping investigation that came after Canada implemented 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric cars and 25 per cent on steel and aluminum last year. China also filed a complaint about Canada’s tariffs with the World Trade Organization.

**United States:**

Takeaways from the Supreme Court arguments on [birthright citizenship](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/politics/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-nationwide-injunctions-executive-order) and nationwide injunctions. The Supreme Court on Thursday seemed open to lifting a series of nationwide orders blocking President Donald Trump from enforcing his birthright citizenship policy, even as several of the justices wrestled with the practical implications of allowing the government to deny citizenship to people born in the US. After more than two hours of argument, it was uncertain how a majority of the court might deal with those two competing interests. Barrett, who has emerged as a key vote in several cases this year involving the Trump administration, pressed Sauer about why the government was entirely avoiding the merits of the birthright citizenship issue. Her line of questioning drew an important concession from Sauer, who acknowledged the legal arguments defending the merits of Trump’s order were “novel” and “sensitive.” In the run up to the arguments, there was significant debate about what the case is actually about: Was it about judicial power, and the ability of lower courts to block a president or the practical impacts of allowing this president to enforce this order? Throughout the debate on Thursday, it was clear that many of the justices were also having difficulty separating those two issues. “The real concern, I think, is that your argument seems to turn our justice system, in my view at least, into a ‘catch me if you can’ kind of regime,” said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people’s rights.” Even though the case has reached the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it’s not clear how long it will take the justices to resolve it.

[DHS Exploring Reality TV Show](https://www.newsweek.com/dhs-reality-tv-show-migrants-compete-citizenship-2073094) Where Migrants Compete For Citizenship. The Department of Homeland Security is reportedly reviewing a pitch for a reality TV show in which immigrants compete for the chance to fast-track their path to U.S. citizenship. DHS is reportedly collaborating with writer and producer Rob Worsoff to develop the show called The American, in which immigrants take part in a series of challenges across the country for a shot at U.S. citizenship, the Daily Mail reports. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin acknowledged the pitch's existence, the newspaper reported, addding ""I think it's a good idea."" Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is supporting the proposal, however the DHS said that was ""completely false"" and Noem is unaware of the pitch.

[Green Cards Could Be Revoked](https://www.newsweek.com/green-car-revoked-white-house-immigration-2072578) At Any Time Under White House Proposal. The Justice Department told the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has the authority to reconsider and potentially revoke green card holders' lawful permanent residency at any time. If the court sides with the Trump administration's position, the decision would effectively allow the government to revoke a green card years or even decades after it was issued. Critics warn this would erode due process. President Donald Trump pledged to deport millions of migrants without legal status. Trump has said that immigration enforcement would primarily focus on individuals with criminal records.

On Wednesday, Logan Rozos, an undergraduate student speaker from NYU’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study, delivered his commencement speech in which he said: “The only thing that is appropriate to say in this time and to a group this large is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine.” Rozos told the crowd that “as I search my heart today in addressing you all”, it is his “moral and political commitments \[that\] guide me” into condemning Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, which has killed at least 53,000 Palestinians over the last year and a half.

Wisconsin judge [pleads not guilty](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/hannah-dugan-arraignment-judge-undocumented-immigrant) on charges of concealing undocumented immigrant. A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on Tuesday on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings. The Trump administration has said Dugan's case is meant to send a message to other judges not to interfere with its immigration crackdown. She could face up to six years in prison if she is convicted on both counts, per AP. A couple hundred protesters demonstrated outside the courthouse against Dugan's arrest and the Trump administration's immigration policies, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ‘Unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional’: [Judge motions to kill indictment](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/unprecedented-and-entirely-unconstitutional-judge-motions-to-kill-indictment-for-allegedly-obstructing-ice-agents-shreds-trump-admin-for-even-trying/) for allegedly obstructing ICE agents, shreds Trump admin for even trying.

Top [Sexual Assault Hotline RAINN Caves](https://newrepublic.com/post/195327/top-sexual-assault-hotline-rainn-caves-trump) to Trump in Chilling Move. The largest organization devoted to survivors of sexual abuse is caving to Donald Trump and dropping support for immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, and other marginalized groups, out of fear of losing federal funding. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, or RAINN, has directed staff at its crisis hotline not to direct callers to resources that would violate the White House’s executive orders against diversity, equity, and inclusion, The New York Times reports. A list of organizations that staffers are authorized to refer callers to has been stripped of specialized mental health hotlines for gay and transgender people; the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a group that educates students about sex-based discrimination; and books about male-on-male or female-on-female sexual violence. The changes went into effect three months ago, a RAINN spokesperson told the Times.

US financial regulators are preparing to announce the largest cut in bank capital requirements since the 2008 financial crisis, signalling a new phase in President Donald Trump’s sweeping deregulatory agenda. According to people familiar with the matter, agencies led by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are expected to reduce the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)—a rule requiring large banks to hold a certain level of high-quality capital against total assets, the Financial Times reported.

DHS requests [20,000 National Guard troops](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/department-homeland-security-requests-20000-national-guard-troops/) to help with mass deportation. The Department of Homeland Security has requested roughly 20,000 National Guard troops to assist with the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, two U.S. officials told CBS News Thursday. The Defense Department is still reviewing the request, and National Guard troops could be pulled from different states to help DHS. The officials said the troops are being requested to assist law enforcement authorities with logistics and operations related to immigration actions in the interior of the U.S., which would represent the latest expansion of the Trump administration's unprecedented use of the military to support its large-scale immigration enforcement campaign. There are already about 8,600 federal troops at the border. The U.S. military has recently created two National Defense Areas, narrow ribbons of land stretching around 230 miles along the border in New Mexico and Texas, which are being treated as extensions of military bases.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s call to review a decades-old drug used for abortion received swift pushback from critics who say the effort is based on bad information and is a threat to an increasingly endangered reproductive rights landscape. Kennedy agreed with a senator on Wednesday that a recent study from a conservative think tank, the Ethics & Public Policy Center, warrants a review of the abortion drug mifepristone. The fight around mifepristone sits at the center of the reproductive rights landscape. Anti-abortion advocates have fought in courts and on the policy front to have the Food and Drug Administration revisit its safety determination of the drug.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has fired two top intelligence officials who oversaw a recent intelligence assessment which contradicted President Donald Trump’s assertions that the gang Tren de Aragua is operating under the direction of the Venezuelan regime, two officials said Wednesday. The assessment undermined the rationale for Trump invoking a rarely used 1798 law, the Alien Enemies Act, to allow suspected Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang members in the U.S. to be summarily deported without standard due process. Gabbard dismissed Michael Collins, the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council, and council vice chair Maria Langan-Riekhof, both career officials with decades of experience in intelligence analysis, two officials said.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum demanded answers from the Trump administration regarding its recent acceptance of 17 relatives of drug kingpin Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán and his son, Ovidio Guzmán, both prominent leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. ""They need to explain themselves first,"" Sheinbaum said during a passage of her daily press conference on Wednesday. ""We still don't have any official explanation or public details about why this family was permitted entry into the United States."" She emphasized the urgency for transparency, particularly since the Trump administration recently designated Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations.

After years of unsatisfying coffee cups, I have decided to finaly start my journey and get a decent setup. My current setup is a blade grinder and a 4-Cup moka pot.

The only thing I invested in so far is the coffee itself, and now my first purchase is going to be a grinder, and here comes the question: I'm going to keep drinking moka for a while, until I go to step 2 and get an espresso machine, Im thinking of getting a 1Zpresso KU since its good with multiple ranges (where I could use it for moka now and espresso later)  but the price is really not convincing since I could pay a bit more and get a Eureka Mignon  Silenzio or even a Specialita if I squeeze myself a bit more, so which should I get, which is better?

1ko255m,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1ko255m/im_scared/,I'm scared,"Hi all,

I just picked up my 150mg prescription that was recommended to me both my my psychiatrist and primary care doctor.

I will try to be open for context. I'm very high functioning and responsible despite my challenges. I have a great job, a wonderful family, and awesome friends. I have though been so self-isolated given what I'm dealing with and have a hard time picking up activities that once brought me joy.

I struggle with ADHD, depression, anxiety, longterm digestive issues and I'm trying to stop vaping/nicotine. Additionally, I have had a tendency to go overboard on alcohol on the weekends especially in recent years. Nicotine I feel has made all of my issues worse and also took already quirky eating habits into full blown eating disorder territory. Black coffee is something that I couldn't imagine giving up but could cut back on. The poor coping skills have gotten a lot better over time (though still impacting my life in their rigidity/rules which in some ways is almost more frustrating). All of this worsened around 2020 (also the time I started using nicotine) and I feel like I'm finally seeing years later how the pandemic affected me in all of these weird behaviors.

The silver lining is that I feel like I've finally exhausted myself on this way of life. It's embarrassing and really impacting my health. It's all like an honest attempt at self care gone bad! So irritating. My ability to focus is poor at best these days and I'm struggling so bad.

My question for anyone who may have something to share is this: I know we are all so different, but what could I expect? I need hope that things can change as I feel so sad and hopeless. I'm actively working on changing my habits, I've gotten back into therapy, seeing my psychiatrist, and praying that Bupropion will be a good fit to at least provide some relief during a period of change towards bettering my life. I'm so sensitive to routine changes and medication. Also are you able to use 4mg nrt gum while on this medication?

Anyways that's what I've got - so glad I found this subreddit. You guys are inspiring me to feel safe giving this an honest shot! I'm really proud of everyone here.",5,1747405433.0,bupropion,21,1.0,False

Hey, I’m Mia! I’m “Gold Verified.” I’m offering a girlfriend experience that’s centered around authentic connection, not just a transactional dynamic. I’m someone who truly values real chemistry and meaningful conversations that feel natural and fulfilling. This isn’t about “going through the motions” for me. Im not looking to play a role, I wont put on a show and not interested in playing pretend. I love to laugh, and I want someone I can really laugh with, I’m talking about that real - genuine - stomach hurts - spit your coffee out - type of laughter 😆 . A girlfriend experience with me looks like those kinds of laughs, often. It looks like having someone you can talk to, confide in, and share honest, genuine experiences with.

Let’s be real, “spicy” content can be bought anywhere and most of it is free to look at anyway lol. I don’t want someone who prioritizes that over meaningful connection. connection is the real luxury, here. I’d like to do this with someone who understands that, and someone who wants to connect with me emotionally and intimately. Yes, we’ll have an “understanding” - but I’m looking for something that feels less like a transaction and more like a real connection. The kind where we both feel seen, supported, and appreciated.

Outside of this, my life is really fulfilling. Im career oriented, but in my spare time I’m probably enjoying an Italian dinner w/ family, on a hike w/ my pups, hitting the beach in the summer, binge watching a show, or curled up on the couch (in oversized sweats) reading a book or writing my novel. I thrive on good energy & spontaneous adventures. If you like a woman who’s full of life, a little bold, and always ready to lift you up, hey..we might just click. Im a social butterfly, but I also get along with people who are more introverted. It would be cool to do this with someone who matches my energy, but sometimes the best connections are the ones where opposites balance each other out. 

Overall..I’m down to earth, low drama, and I like to think I bring something different to the table. I pride myself on being real and one of a kind. If you’ve actually read this far, chances are you’re exactly the kind of person I’d love to hear from. 

Curious? Good.  😏 Send me a message to find out more.

1ko24sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/comments/1ko24sd/tried_to_end_things_didnt_go_well/,"Tried to end things, didnt go well","Soooo. Long story short, father of my kids has been with someone else our entire relationship. For back story, he was engaged when we met (I didnt know!) but when I found out, I also didn't end it like I should have.. I was a stupid college kid and feel awful for that. But then I got pregnant, and he ""left her"" and moved in with me. However, I always knew he still saw her (leaving receipts with her name on it, coming home with random gifts for himself when he had no money, saying he worked when his timesheet showed otherwise.  I found one of those ""what I love about you books"" she gave him, and it mentions things like ""I love watching you interact with (my child)"" and ""i love your kisses, theyre intoxicating"" and ""i love that being apart is only temporary"". I found this years ago, so I know its old, but still clearly after our kid was born. He'll go out every weekend to the"" chiropractor"" and come home with lunch, often with her name on the receipt. He'll also go to a retail store with her, bcs my friend who works there says he sees them about every weekend during this time. 

I confronted him about all of this, and he first tried saying he stilll talks to her and sees her sometimes yeah, but they're just friends and he hasn't touched her since he moved in. But he made it seem way more ""we run into each other (both work at the same college different buildings) and occasionally have coffee or something. He admits hes definitely lead her on and that's wrong, but he cared about her and the whole situation was hard and weird. I told him even IF there's nothing physical, it's definitely 100% emotional cheating and a betrayal. 

He also tries to turn it on me, saying if I had told him I knew years ago he woulda stopped talking to her years ago. I explained that's not the point, and I shouldn't have had to catch him or bring it up for it not to be happening considering he told me he ended thigns with her completely. (I do get I should have though, but I always went into an anxious depressive spiral at the thought of splitting the family, now I just grew balls and also went to therapy to help me get there). 

Idk. In the end I feel awful. I do know he loves the kids more than anything, and I do believe he loves me and actually wants to be with me, even kids aside. To be honest, I'm not even too concerned on my own emotions and well-being, my kids are by FAR the most important thing to me, and at first I thought this would be best for everyone and we can co-parent and he'd end up with her and we could just get along and see the kids on a 2-2-3 and attend events together and be civil right? But seeing him sobbing nonstop in tears over not seeing us like that anymore or the thought of not seeing his kids every single day, then knowing how my kids would feel about it (aged 5 and 7 btw), it broke me and I worry its not in the best interest of the kids. I'm emotionally over the whole betrayal thing, it killed me the first few years but eventually I just accepted it, I just finally ended things now cause I thought itd be better off for everyone ( a breaking point is I've always wanted a dog, and after months of asking he finally flat out said we are not getting one, and MAYBE when we got a house with a yard he'd consider it, but even then it's just a maybe.) It made me have the thought of wow he can have this whole other life, but I cant even get a dog (that I agreed I'd be solely responsible for, walks, mess clean up, training, etc). He's not allergic, he used to have one. He just doesnt wanna deal. Now he's also saying I'm picking a dog over my family, which is so unfair. He also panicked because he'd have nowhere to go, he doesnt really have any friends or family to stay with, and he can't afford his own place (his salary is too low to afford his own here). I guess I figured he'd move in with her, but it seems he truly doesn't want that regardless.

So I'll be shopping at a couple stores buying some stuff, then wrap up with my errands with a quick stop at the grocery store as the very last stop (since food is perishable). Basically a couple bagsworth of shopping piles up in my car

I get home and, being only 1 guy, I struggle to take everything ***at the same time***. Especially if I happen to have a cup of drivethru coffee in my hand or similar ""requires one dedicated hand to hold it"" item that can spill over/cause a mess if accidentally tipped over? It's definitely annoying doing some minor ""juggling act"" attempting to carry all my shopping haul/bags in one go 👎 Depending on if it's a lot of stuff, I'll have to make multiple trips, which is annoying in itself

Sometimes a random family or random couple will happen to be getting home/parking nearby after I've parked and I'm a bit jealous of how they can just take all their shopping/grocery haul up in one go... the guy grabs a couple bags (usually the heaviest ones), the GF or wife grabs a couple bags, maybe they have kid A and kid B grab one smaller/lighter bag each, etc

Anyways, this is one of those recurring pet-peeves of mine, even if it's just a minor thing. Thanks for listening to my impromptu morning vent
