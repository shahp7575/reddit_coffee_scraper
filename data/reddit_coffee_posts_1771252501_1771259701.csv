Also, when inside the Matrix, did free humans ever casually interact with regular (unaware) people?
Would that be allowed, discouraged, or considered risky?

1r6e542,https://www.reddit.com/r/transontario/comments/1r6e542/trans_new_brunswick_subreddit/,Trans New Brunswick subreddit,"*Hi Folks!*

*As some of you know, I'm wrapping up my Ottawa electrolysis practice  and relocating out of Moncton New Brunswick in about a month from now. As part of that effort I've been in contact with some advocacy groups for lgbtq support and there are big things happening in New Brunswick!  It starts with anew liberal government that is trying to do everything differently than the previous conservative one. With that in mind there are discussion happening within the new brunswick to adopt WPATH recommendations for transgender people of new brunswick. This is huge news!*

*Among other things, WPATH recommendation include  coverage for electrolysis. access for hormone therapy and the establishment of gender care medical clinics and yes all of this is being considered and implemented by the New Brunswick government right now. My contacts with  an advocacy  coordinator here in Ontario advises me that it all VERY close to implementation. This will mean not only COVERED electrolysis treatments  ( the first province in Canada to do so!)  but also very soon  an anouncement should be made for a gender care clinic out of Fredericton to provide access to hormone therapy, and I'm working on making electrolysis available through that location as well.* 

*I've also been put in contact with the New Brunswick Trans Health Network who are spearheading this campaign  and will be continuing to do so. I'm fully supportive of these efforts and will be doing everything I can to help.This includes setting up a a training program for new electrologists  to provide care for New Brunswick transpeople through my association with Swanson Canadian Institute of Electrolysis. I'm very happy to do so!*

*One of the things that has helped rally  trans people here in Ontario, is this very subreddit which I've taken part in from the very beginning. IT serves as repository for people to get help through a peer -assisted model that works very well an I'm proud to have supported it. One of the things I realized however, was resources like this subreddit are few and virtually non-existent for New Brunswick. we  here in this redit provide not only a rallying ppoint for political change to better our lives, but as an invaluable repositorry of knowledge of resources for transpeople, from peer support, to hormone therapy, housing  options, phsychologists and a whole lot more. Not to put too fine a point on it, but as ATlantic Canada is a much smaller and less organized transgender community, they need exactly this.A place to rally support, access resources and discuss with peers. I've spoken to a few already and know you are out there ( I'm impressed by how many have approached me already!) but some organization  and a rallying spot so people can get involved, is desperately needed.* 

  
With this in mind, I have just this past week established  a new subreddit r/trans_NewBrunswick  to serve as a rallying point and  to learn about access to resources. for new brunswick transpeople. Because we are a smaller community  the effort needs  people to get involved. I'll be continuing to support the New Brunswick transgender Health Network  and am looking to get  more involved.  I'm hoping the trans subreddit will see some support and I know there are many new brunswick transpeople already in this subreddit who will take this opportunity to get involved in the grass roots effort already underway., the more support we have the easier things will be for all of us ongoing.And no, this is not a New Brunswick specific subreddit. The same efforts are already taking place in PEI, Nova Scotia  Newfoundland and throughout atlantic canada. Together we are stonger. Apart we remain divided. get involved!

I'd also like to thank Dylana, the  transgender advocacy coordinator I've been working with and who has been so helpful in providing me contact points and for her work in helping the groups making this happen for all of us. A special shoutout as well to Fae Johnston for being such a beautiful articulate spokesperson for the transgender health network, so to Fae ( who I 'm pretty sure is here somewhere in this subreddit)  if you feel inclined, hit me up for  coffee  before I go I'd love to meet and share strategies.

He keeps buying tech gadgets like he's still a bachelor, ignoring the spills, falls, and fights that come with kids. We’ve handled carpet stains, juice disasters, marker battles, and the occasional Lego attack, but nothing prepared me for today’s coffee table disaster.  
  
Not long ago, he bought this smart coffee table. It has a touchscreen surface, built-in wireless charging, Bluetooth speakers, and illuminated edges—everything gadget lovers dream of. It looks great. However, it seems functionally questionable around small children.  
  
So here’s what happened:  
  
Nobody was watching the kids. One jab turned into a big fight between the teenager and one of the toddlers. They decided to use the coffee table as their battleground, as if the table were a referee that wronged them. Next thing I saw were spilled drinks, scratches, and cracks decorating the surface like modern art.  
  
Now I'm at a loss for words. Do smart tables like this even get repaired? Once the touchscreen is broken and the frame is dented, is it finished for good? I’m tempted to look for a replacement on Alibaba, but that doesn’t seem like the best choice.

I made these three Barbarian paths as a way to ""rework"" Storm Herald. I wasn't a fan of the weak, somewhat bland approach to the fantasy of a Barbarian so in tune with their environment that they harness the literal powers of the elements. I started off just trying to reflavor and revamp the base Storm Herald, but honestly decided it needed to just be split into three different paths, complete with their own flavor, backstory hooks, and Rage aura at level 14! 

  
My design for these started with the idea of Barbarian Paths being a culturally significant part of a nomadic tribes' daily life while enduring a harsh climate (namely a desert, glacier/tundra, or archipelagic environment such as the Māori and Polynesian peoples). I wanted to keep the flavor and power fantasy of a person whose Rage is connected to the fury of their environment and love for their homeland.

Stocks confused. Crypto caffeinated. Gold cautious. Copper… quietly judging everyone.

Welcome to another episode of “Markets Trying to Figure Themselves Out.”

It’s Monday. The coffee is strong. Conviction is not.

# Equities: Schrödinger’s Bull Market

Stocks opened the week in that familiar modern mood:  
optimistic for 12 minutes, nervous for the next 30.

Investors are stuck in the classic 2026 dilemma:

* Is growth slowing?
* Is inflation sticky?
* Is policy tightening done?
* Or are we just going to overreact again?

Tech names are twitchy. Broader indices are drifting. Nobody wants to miss a rally, but nobody trusts one either.

It’s less “risk-on” and more “risk-leaning-forward-with-one-foot-out-the-door.”

# Crypto: Volatility Is Back on the Menu

Crypto woke up and chose movement.

Big intraday swings. Social feeds heating up. Liquidations doing their thing.

The pattern remains familiar:  
Crypto trades with liquidity.  
Liquidity trades with macro.  
Macro trades with vibes.

At the moment, vibes are unstable.

Momentum is present — but fragile. When equities sneeze, crypto catches a cold.

# Gold: Calm but Watching

Gold continues doing what gold does best:  
standing quietly in the corner while everyone argues.

It’s not exploding higher. It’s not collapsing either. It’s hovering — supported by uncertainty but capped by rate expectations.

Gold’s current energy can be summarised as:  
“I told you this would happen.”

# Silver: Drama as Usual

Silver remains silver.

Industrial exposure + speculative positioning = mood swings.

It wants to rally. It wants to correct. It does both, sometimes before lunch.

Structural deficit narratives are still in play, but silver rarely moves politely.

#  Copper: The Adult in the Room

Copper isn’t trending wildly today.

It’s not panicking.  
It’s not euphoric.

It’s doing something much less exciting: reflecting real economic demand.

Inventories remain elevated after seasonal slowdowns, but the bigger themes haven’t gone anywhere:

* Electrification
* Grid upgrades
* EV demand
* Data centre expansion
* Renewable infrastructure

Copper doesn’t trade narratives.  
It trades whether the world is building things.

And last time we checked, the world still is.

# Commodities Overall: Less Drama, More Function

Energy is moving on headlines.  
Agricultural commodities are steady.  
Industrial metals are watching China closely.

There’s no broad commodity panic.

Just recalibration.

# The Bigger Picture

Today isn’t about collapse.  
It’s about uncertainty.

Equities are searching for direction.  
Crypto is magnifying sentiment.  
Precious metals are balancing caution.  
Copper is quietly tied to the real economy.

When markets wobble, you start to notice which assets depend on narrative… and which depend on necessity.

Right now, necessity looks a lot less dramatic.",1,1771258887.0,u_Click4Copper,0,1.0,False

1r6dzi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lootrdotfun/comments/1r6dzi1/im_building_a_static_nft_history_project_about/,I’m building a “static NFT + history” project about commodities — would love honest feedback,"Hi everyone I'm presenting myself as Lootr dot Fun,

I’ve been working on a long-term NFT project called COMMODIA and I’d like honest feedback before launching it publicly. (This project is experimental as I'm not qualify coder and must of the time I'm asking AI to code it for me!) (I do have a felling on how an app or website functionality needs to work so lets hope I don't mess up the idea.)

So before you move in to the reading be sure I'm not responsible for any loses and you are fully responsible to connect your wallet with dapps, websites and so on... with things not fully tested and audited if you fell like contributing let me know.

As of now i don't have the much ETH to deploy the 2 fully created contracts but Commodia is in Sepolia test net and the dapp is working in my local environment, i just need to pay for the server to run the front end demo marketplace...

(I still have to finger out how to deploy it in the hosting said but before spending any money i want to find out if this idea seams to be ok)

    WE will be using: React + Vite + TypeScript dApp for Sepolia marketplace monitoring, with:
    - Subgraph snapshot/activity reads
    - Infura HTTP + WebSocket providers
    - Ethers v6
    - Zustand state
    - 90s terminal/CRT UI

The idea is different from most NFT collections apart that its main approach was to create a trading businesses felling between collectors, enthusiast, and flippers in to a trading floor.

COMMODIA is a fixed set of 10,000 commodity cards (Wheat, Oil, Copper, etc).  
The art and metadata never change. Ever.

https://preview.redd.it/ud0mnw6lnvjg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=10a6ecbb647e1b0deab6e4272eafaaa23555a0bf

There are:

* No trait upgrades
* No evolving visuals
* No staking
* No gamification

Instead, what grows over time is the historical context around each card.

If you own a card, you can submit “Time-Stamped Economic Snapshots” — short factual statements about real-world events (for example: “Oil prices collapsed after supply shock”).

The text itself is stored off-chain (Arweave/IPFS), but the proof and confirmations are stored on Ethereum.

UPLOADED: Arweave already spent $ to upload the cards images and also metadata. (permanent uploaded confirmation)

https://preview.redd.it/4h29fv8knvjg1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=2942129fbb1949c23ceb4031b7de9012a6948bed

So the card stays fixed.  
The world changes around it.

Some cards may end up with rich historical records. (or non at all)  
Others may stay silent forever.  
That’s intentional.

There’s also a rare “finalization” system that permanently closes historical periods.

It’s meant to feel more like:

* a reference archive
* a collectible document
* a long-term recor

…than a typical PFP project.

I’ve already generated the full artwork, archived it, and built the contract. I’m testing with a small demo set first.

[Video of the Marketplace](https://lootr.fun/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Demo-of-Commodia-dapp-.mp4)

I’m not selling anything yet. I’m trying to understand:

* Does this concept feel meaningful?
* Would you collect something like this?
* Does it feel too abstract?
* What would make it clearer or better?

If anyone wants to test or review, I can share screenshots and links. (working on the link show interest for me to pay for a sever to deploy...)

Open to all feedback, good or bad.

If you interested in deployment send me a donation to (**0x3cA853F23749FED81A9346b957085E07f8559a5d**) at the end of the day you the one contributing to this project with your ETH to deploy!

(hope it works what i have here, don't donate if you need your ETH be ready! expect it will not go 100% smooth as i said the code of this project is fully created by AI I'm no a coder just an enthusiast trying things)

1r6dz89,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1r6dz89/oracle_jet_how_i_tried_to_mechanically_outsmart/,Oracle Jet – How I Tried to Mechanically Outsmart an Automated Espresso Machine,"We bought the Oracle Jet as a daily driver.

Partly because my partner has zero interest in full manual workflow at 7 a.m.
Partly because even I sometimes just want coffee without a pre-flight checklist.

And to be fair: the Jet absolutely delivers on that promise.

What we did not expect to stumble over — like many others — was the default dose.

22 grams.
Sometimes 23.
With certain beans even close to 24.

If we assume Arabica, that’s roughly 250 mg caffeine per shot.
Add Robusta and you’re flirting with “three cans of Red Bull” territory.

We drink multiple cups per day.

That escalated quickly.

So we did what rational people do.
We adjusted.

Somewhere along the way this turned into:

> “What happens when someone tries to physically control an automated system.”



This post is not about espresso basics.
It’s about tamper mechanics, headspace physics, basket geometry — and how deep this rabbit hole actually goes.

If you’re perfectly happy with 22–24 g doses, stop reading here and enjoy your life.

If you’re trying to live in the 18–19 g range without giving up the Auto-Tamper…

Welcome.


---

The Obvious Solutions (and why they weren’t enough)

Yes, the Jet includes a single basket (~11 g).
It works. Technically.

If you’re not overly picky about extraction quality, it’s fine.

You can also split the shot.
The stock portafilter has two spouts — share with your partner, roommate, neighbor, delivery driver.

Or… pour half down the sink.
Apparently people do that.

I personally can’t bring myself to waste good coffee like that.

Which leaves one real option:

Mechanical intervention.


---

The Auto-Tamper Coupling – Where Everything Starts

If you’ve ever seen the Auto-Tamper create a surface like in Image 1 — a wavy compression pattern — you already know this system is sensitive to friction and geometry.

The Auto-Tamper spins while grounds fall in.
It stops at a defined height.
That height is purely mechanical.

Remove the spinning disk.
Pull out the coupling.
Loosen the 2 mm set screw.
Rotate.

That’s it.

The coupling consists of two threaded parts (see Image 4).
Adjusting their total length determines how deep the tamper travels into the basket.

Screw inward → shorter assembly → more coffee
Screw outward → longer assembly → less coffee

Simple in theory.

Less simple in practice.


---

Version Details (and the small things that made me curious)

On my unit, the lower piece is not fully threaded (see Image 4).
There’s a smooth, threadless section near the end.

Earlier versions online appear fully threaded.

Why the change?
No idea.

Possibly marking max adjustment range.
Possibly manufacturing change.
Possibly me overthinking.

There’s also a small alignment mark (see Image 2), helpful when counting turns.

Important detail:

The threaded piece has two opposite flat sides.
The set screw must engage those flats.

Meaning:

You can only adjust in half-turn increments.
No quarter turns. No micro-tweaks.

From fully screwed in (tight), my factory setting was:

1.25 turns out
—or exactly one full turn from first proper flat alignment.

Write that down before experimenting.

At around +2 full turns, the set screw barely engages anymore.
That’s effectively the mechanical limit.

At that point, with the stock Sage basket, I landed just above 20 g.

Better.
But still not 18–19 g.

And now we need to talk headspace.


---

Headspace – Why “Near Zero” Might Be Intentional

With factory settings, my headspace was basically zero.

Dry lock-in showed clear shower screen contact.

This contradicts the common “2 mm ideal headspace” advice.

But think about the system:

The Auto-Tamper does not compress the outer ring as perfectly as a human would.

Minimal headspace means the shower screen physically stabilizes the puck during pressure build-up.

Tamper + shower screen = shared stabilization system.

When increasing headspace significantly, extraction still worked.
Taste remained good.

But visually things became less clean:

More edge activity.
Occasional micro-jets.
Less “textbook bottomless”.

I eventually settled around +0.5 turns from factory.

Minimal headspace.
Clean bottomless shots.
Stable results.

But to consistently reach 18–19 g…

The stock basket wasn’t enough.


---

Basket Universe

(Why there are seven versions of what looks like the same metal cup)

I tested most relevant IMS models in the B70 2T range.

Some patterns became clear with the Auto-Tamper:

• Straight walls behave more stable than tapered
• Flat bottoms behave more stable than convex
• Avoid NT coating (too smooth → increased slipping risk)

Why?

The Auto-Tamper rotates and applies lateral force.
Straight walls guide grounds upward during compression.
Convex bottoms reduce center contact surface → grounds can slip → wave formation (see Image 1).

And yes. I had waves.


---

B702TCH24E (24 mm, convex)

Moderate candidate.
Volume reduction negligible (~0.5 g less than stock).

Fully functional.
But not helpful for lower dose goals.

Good option if staying near factory dose but wanting flow variation.


---

B702TH22.5M (22.5 mm, slightly tapered)

Closer to Sage geometry.
At +2 turns: ~18 g achieved.

However: pronounced wave pattern.

Lightly roughening inner walls with Scotch-Brite eliminated it immediately.

But this is a ridged basket.
The puck ended right at the ridge height.
With Auto-Tamper, that didn’t feel mechanically ideal.

Removed from rotation.


---

B702TCH22E (22 mm, convex)

Frequently recommended online.

At +2 turns: ~16 g.
Also wave-prone.

Again, slight inner wall roughening solved it.

Interestingly, I tested two units of this basket.
One was much less prone to waves even without modification.

Manufacturing tolerances seem to matter.

Good candidate for low doses and nice bottomless visuals —
but convex geometry makes it slightly more sensitive.


---

B702TFH22 (22 mm, flat bottom, straight walls)

No waves. Ever.

Auto-Tamper behaves perfectly here.

Very stable daily candidate.

Downside:
Even at +0.5 turns, dose hovered around ~19.5 g.

Going lower increased headspace and introduced minor visual imperfections.

Taste still excellent.

If you’re happy under 20 g: strong recommendation.


---

B702TFH21.5BB (“Big Bang”)

Flat bottom. Straight walls.
0.5 mm shorter than TFH22.
Distinct perforation pattern and slightly grippier surface.

Avoid NT coating.

This one finally landed me where I wanted to be:

Factory setting → ~19.2 g
+0.5 turn → ~18.5 g average

Stable.
Clean bottomless.
No channeling.
No waves.

This is where I stopped.

Could I push under 18 g?
Yes.

Would visuals get slightly imperfect?
Also yes.

But flavor stayed exactly where I wanted it.


---

Final Thoughts

The Oracle Jet’s Auto-Tamper is more sensitive to basket geometry than I expected.

Headspace near zero seems intentional.
Flat bottoms and straight walls are safest.
Convex geometry increases slipping risk.
NT coating is not Auto-Tamper friendly.

If you’re trying to reduce dose without sacrificing automation:

It’s possible.
But it’s mechanical.
Not digital.

And yes — I definitely spent more on baskets than necessary.

If this saves someone €150 in experiments, I’ll consider that a win.

Curious:

Who else went down this rabbit hole with the Jet?
Anyone running stable 18 g setups without geometry changes?

1r6dz75,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1r6dz75/i_dont_want_to_do_this_anymore/,I don't want to do this anymore...,"I'm a mom of two (early elementary ages) and work a full-time remote job in IT. My kids go to the most wonderful (private) little homeschool co-op that I helped to start and so I can't quit my job as I need to make money to afford their school. We also moved to a new house a while ago and need my income to keep up on everything. Not to mention just everything in the world feels so expensive and it's not calming down at all. Things like house improvements/fixes keep coming up, swim lessons, extracurriculars, etc. It all adds up. And, being in IT means everything revolves around technology, which is the exact opposite of what I want to be in/around these days. I want more nature, more solitude, more peace. 

I think if you would have told me years ago that this would be my work situation I would have been ecstatic, but here I am wishing each and every day I didn't have to do this anymore. It's not that I don't want to work, but I want to do something meaningful and just not have it take up my whole day. I want to spend time with my kids and not always be getting annoyed with them for interrupting me when I'm supposed to be working (when they are home). I'm exhausted at the end of each day when I actually do have a little bit of time with them, that I am just irritable and always in that weird phase of the day when you're trying to get dinner on the table, figure out homework, figure out how to get them to do their chores without the meltdowns, and bed time. I barely have time for myself or my husband to connect. 

Last year, I took a week off just to do things around the house and relax a bit. Also because I was majorly burned out. I swear it was the best week ever. I was able to wake up and get the kids ready, relax with some coffee and alone time after my husband would take them to school, go for a walk or do some movement, then get some projects and chores done around the house... actually plan and make a healthy meal that I wasn't just half-hazard throwing together, and guess what - I was in a good mood the whole time and actually had energy at the end of each day. 

I guess this post is just a rant or for solidarity. Not needing anyone to solve anything. I know I could probably quit my job and do something part time but then my kids would have to be pulled from this beautiful thing I helped to create (their school) and I just can't let that happen. Anyway, hoping someone out there can relate. :)",3,1771258754.0,workingmoms,1,0.8,False

I guess I have two questions: (1) that grind looks way too coarse right? That can’t be 64 clicks, right? My brew time went WAY too fast and the coffee was under extracted.

You said I was the man you’ve been looking for, I guess I was one time. 

I had a Guinness for coffee, and a cigarette for crepes. 

And a healthy helping, with all the fixins, of sour grapes. 

I’ve never known happy, the way that I know blue. 

I’ve come to know having, just means you will lose.

1r6dw9r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6dw9r,The Virgin NYC,"I am capping off a 2 night staycation ( we live in Manhattan) at the Virgin NYC. This was a long weekend/ valentine’s weekend celebration for my partner and I. 

**The Math** : We took advantage of the $250 Edit + $250 property specific credit + $100 Chase Travel offer, and paid 18.5k points at 2x point boost.

Most folks have covered this property on this sub, so just imma just quickly bullet some points that are in the top of my head.

1) Property is in a great location in Midtown Korea Town with subway access 2 minutes away.

2) For my asian travellers- Lady M boutique is one street away! Great for us as we just grabbed 2 slices of cake in our pajamas !

3) Food wise you get breakfast package for 2 people per day ( covers an entree plus a juice plus a coffee)  as part of the Edit plus a $100 dining credit. Standards food like most American properties-nothing to write home about. We used the $100 credit at their Everdene restaurant for dinner one night.

4) Free water vending machines on every floor! THE IS IS A BIG PLUS IN MY OPINION! AS most of yall know the only way to get access to free drinking water at US hotels means a short trip to the gym. We loved having acess to water on the same floor! ( PS: we still love the Conrad NYC’s in room water filling station!)

5) Gym is small but has all amenities- i loved the machines( not a fan of free weights!). Partner liked her workout on the elliptical. The treadmill has a great view of the Empire State!

6) There is a halal food cart ( Sharifs halal food) 10 seconds walk away from the hotel! Great food! Its got good reviews! Better than Halal Guys IN MY OPINION, but still Adel’s on 6th Ave is the KING! i liked this food cart- $10 for great food!

7) we didnt get any upgrades- the host said “We are fully booked out)- but the room we were assigned to has a great view nevertheless!

8) the in room micro fridge is not on sensors! So feel free to pack your own sodas etc and keep it inside the fridge!

1r6dv3g,https://i.redd.it/bzyk5khxsvjg1.jpeg,Tim - you sent me a message last night and below is my response. Stop throwing a fit and grow up.,"Tim sent a message last night complaining about a Riddit post that was posted with numerous hotel names listed as a possible place that they are staying at. Pretty much said that the group is trying to pin point where they are staying at and that I need to take the post down and be more responsible for this page. 

Number 1 - I have a life and a family I take care of. I WORK to be able to pay my bills, they dont know what that means, but being a grown adult like Tim and Angela, I take care of my responsibilities and don’t get on TikTok to beg for other adults to pay my way through life. Maybe they should try it. 

Second thing, I will not take the post down. Tim you’ve put yourself out on a public platform for almost 2 years now and begged for other people to take care of you and fund your life with little to no accountability or any effort to change your circumstances. You’ve taken money from vulnerable people who have huge hearts with promises to pay them back and they still haven’t been paid back. 

Third thing - you sit and complain about awareness and Riddit posts. How many jobs have you and Angela applied to since your last job in what, September of last year that YOUR WIFE DOXXED. No one did that to you except Angela. So it’s been 5 months or so since you’ve worked and gotten any kind of paycheck. 

You put yourself and your life on TikTok and take advantage of people. Lie about cancer, try to use religion to make yourself look good. Have called me and scam opera c\*nts and also have talked trash about Falon because we are trying to save honest hard working people from sending their money to two grown ass adults who refuse to work or do anything to change your circumstances. You have no kids so there’s no reason not to work 2 jobs if you need to - and BOTH OF YOU NEED TO WORK. Instead Ang gets her hair done, buys expensive coffee items (whether with foodstamps or not), buy makeup, clothes etc… 

You want to scam people, beg for money, not do better for yourselves, lie about cancer, take advantage of people day after day, week after week for 2 years almost, get used to not being happy. 

When you stop we stop, and also, I can not dictate who posts what on this page or on TikTok. People are sick of what you’re doing. I myself, don’t care where you are staying or working if you were, but I can’t help what other people do. ",4,1771258506.0,timandangelayeah,2,1.0,False

I don’t have a lot of hope that something magical will happen from a post like this. But I don’t give up. So I’m here. Looking for someone. A partner. Someone kind, open, laughs loud, cries hard, loves harder. My human. This is probably my last attempt before I let my parents step in and do what Indian parents do best. Because one thing I know for sure is that I don’t want to spend my life alone.

Bengaluru based. 30s. Divorced. Dad to an awesome 8 yr old. He keeps me grounded and gives me hope.

After my separation, I took my time. And when I finally trusted again, I trusted deeply. I thought I had found the person I’d build the rest of my life with. But somewhere along the way, commitment didn’t mean the same thing to both of us. She was in her late twenties. I got cheated on. There was uncertainty. I kept forgiving because of her traumatized upbringing, kept trying, partly out of love and partly maybe I was afraid to let go of someone I had dreamt so much with. Or maybe it was the chaos that I was attracted to. Hero syndrome? That I’ll fix her broken childhood. Eventually I realised I was holding on to potential, dreams and not reality. So I walked away.

I’ve done the work since then. Reflected. Healed. Owned my part. Let go of what wasn’t mine. I’m in a genuinely good place now. Wiser. Clearer. Ready to trust again. But this time with alignment and intention.

I’m a Gemini-Taurus cusp, which probably explains the duality. Or maybe it’s because I grew up in a home that encouraged curiosity, hobbies, openness and adventure. Either way, I don’t do life halfway.

On pure impulse and incredible insanity, I convinced a friend and his wife and drove all the way to the Himalayas chasing snow. Just up and left one night because it was a dream for too long. Some nights were hotels, some were camps, and sometimes just sleeping in the car because… why not? I like to ride as well. Recently went up a hill at midnight to catch the Geminids meteor shower. Those quiet, surreal moments under the sky stay with me. I love photography too (Who doesn’t) But in my defense I’ve sold my work a few times!

But I’m just as happy at home. A good book and some tea. Netflix and chill. Or a coffee, laughs and deep conversations that stretch into the night.

And when it’s time to party, I party. Proper all-nighters. Dance floors. Loud music. 3 am conversations about life. I enjoy intensity. I just don’t live in it all the time. Life is balance. I try to find the happiness is everything if I can.

I believe in equality and shared effort. I’m emotionally aware, physically active, well read, and I value good conversation. People who know me tell me I’m very funny. I’d like to believe them. I’m big on hygiene. Body odour is my biggest turn off. Dishonesty is a close second. Clean energy matters.

I love animals. Cats, dogs, the works. Someday I’d love a home with space, pets, and a partner who’s both grounded and spontaneous. But I’m equally fine loving animas from a distance.

1r6dsms,https://i.redd.it/e7a8k7phsvjg1.png,Roast Ops,"coffee-roasting-profiles.deploypad.app

We built Roast Ops inside the roastery.

At Ground Ops Roastery, consistency isn’t optional.

When you serve hundreds of customers a day, every batch matters.

We’ve always believed:

Great coffee is discipline + data + repetition.

But most roasting software felt disconnected from real production environments — either too simple or too bloated.

So we built our own.

Roast Ops was developed from actual production roasting workflows — not theory.

What it helps us do every day:

✔ Track roast curves (BT / ET / ROR)

✔ Compare batches side-by-side

✔ Dial profiles faster

✔ Improve cupping repeatability

✔ Reduce production variability

✔ Build scalable roasting systems

This isn’t about replacing intuition.

It’s about supporting it with measurable precision.

Ground Ops was built on structure and performance.

Roast Ops carries that same DNA.

If you follow our journey, support our cafés, or care about specialty coffee at a high level — this is the technology powering our future.

🌐 coffee-roasting-profiles.deploypad.app

We’re opening beta access to select roasters and production teams.

Let’s build better coffee.

1r6dpxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1r6dpxe/how_to_stop_caring_what_people_think_the_mindset/,How to stop caring what people think: the mindset shift that saved my mental bandwidth,"So many people are secretly exhausted. Not from their job, not from their goals, but from constantly *performing* for others. The pressure feels invisible but heavy. Whether it’s the way you dress, the way you talk, or what career you choose, it’s like someone’s watching and silently judging. And most of the time, no one actually is.  

This post is for people who feel stuck in that loop. It’s put together from science-backed frameworks, books, and podcasts that go deep on this because this isn’t just about “having confidence” or “not caring.” It’s about unlearning old wiring. Here’s what actually works:

**1. Understand the spotlight effect**

Psychologists Thomas Gilovich and Victoria Medvec coined the “spotlight effect” in a study published in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*. It’s the idea that people wildly overestimate how much others notice them. One experiment had participants wear an embarrassing t-shirt and walk into a room. Most believed half the room noticed. In reality, only 20% did. This mental distortion fuels social anxiety. Once you realize people are too busy thinking about *themselves*, you’ll stop imagining all eyes are on you.

**2. Separate reputation from identity**

Dr. David Brooks (author of *The Road to Character*) talks about the difference between résumé virtues and eulogy virtues. One is about how others *see* you. The other is about how you *live*. When you start optimizing for internal values over social approval, you’ll feel more grounded. A 2019 study from *Frontiers in Psychology* found that people who have strong intrinsic goals reported lower anxiety and higher self-worth, even under social pressure.

**3. Practice “selective indifference”**

Not all opinions carry equal weight. Shane Parrish from the Farnam Street blog calls this “building your personal board of directors.” Feedback from five trusted people > opinions of 500 strangers. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman also explains in the Huberman Lab podcast that deliberately lowering your dopamine dependency on external validation (like social media likes) helps reset the brain’s approval circuits.

**4. Take rejection reps on purpose**

Rejection exposure therapy is a real thing. Entrepreneur Jia Jiang documented this in his “100 Days of Rejection” challenge, which later became a TED talk and book. The idea is to desensitize yourself by *seeking* small, low-stakes rejections. Want upgraded coffee for free? Ask. Want a discount? Ask. Fail in public enough and you realize rejection won’t kill you, and you stop fearing people’s judgments so much.

**5. Replace overthinking with action**

Rumination keeps you trapped. Successful people act before they feel ready. According to Mel Robbins (author of *The 5 Second Rule*), delaying action by even 5 seconds gives your brain time to pull the brakes. Small consistent actions build identity over time and drown out the noise of others’ opinions. Identity isn’t built from thoughts. It’s built from doing.

No “one tip fixes all,” but these principles stack. The less you care what people think, the more energy you have to focus on what *you* think.

1r6doxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualIreland/comments/1r6doxv/same_menus_everywhere/,Same. menus. Everywhere.,"Guys is it me or is there a complete dearth of unique stuff on offer in cafes the past few years. Like, as in, we had better brunch and lunch options 7-10 years ago??

I’ll caveat this by saying I haven’t been in Dublin City centre in a long time, and I know there are some decent places there, but in terms of Dublin suburbs/commuter towns that I’ve been in lately, plus any towns further afield, all cafes and lunch spots seem to be serving up the same old slop and menus are getting more and more identical.

Full Irish. Veggie full Irish (usually same as full Irish simply with meat removed, wahoo). Cajun chicken wrap. Tuna melt. Generic vegetarian sandwich with mozzarella. Ham and cheese toastie. Cesar salad.

Generic commodity coffee beans - maybe branded Lavazza if you’re lucky. Lattes and cappuccinos served the same only cappuccinos get the sprinkles on the top. Pre-made smoothies. Cartons of juice.

Can we not do better than this?? I really feel like we used to do better a decade ago.

And yes, I know there are plenty of great ethnic and specialised cafes out there but I’m not talking about these obvious exceptions, I’m talking about your average Main Street cafe which in most cases is just the same from town to town to town. It’s just a bit depressing and feels like you need to drop €€ in Ranelagh or Stoneybatter for anything for lunch that’s decent but not generic.

Case in point: stopped into Koffee and Kale in Ballyer today which previously did a delicious spicy shakshuka - something vaguely different and tasty - and noticed it was taken off the menu to be replaced by….. the generic options listed above.

(And yeah come at me with the don’t-be-looking-for-fine-dining in Ballyer jokes - I’m in before you 😊)

So, am I wrong? Going to the wrong places? Out of touch? Or bang on the mark??",14,1771258139.0,CasualIreland,12,0.71,False

I have compiled a list of the major brands (ON, Avvatar, Amul, MuscleBlaze etc) and categorized them by use case.

**""Best Value for Money"" TIER**

You want protein that works and passes checks, but you don't want to spend Rs3000.

* Nakpro Platinum Whey Isolate
   * Price: \~Rs1550 (0.5kg)
   * Why: This is mathematically the cheapest Isolate in India right now. Most isolates cost Rs4000+, so getting one for under Rs1600 is insane value. It mixes decent enough but you are strictly paying for the protein content not a premium milkshake experience.
   * Best For: Students who need the highest protein percentage for the lowest possible rupee.
* As-It-Is ATOM (Double Rich Chocolate)
   * Price: \~Rs2300
   * Why: It is USA Labdoor Certified(which is a huge trust marker) and includes DigeZyme enzymes so it doesn't bloat you like cheaper raw wheys might. It costs a bit more than other low budget whey, but the taste and digestion are much better.
   * Best For: Beginners who want a certified, trustable brand without spending international prices.
* Amul Whey Protein (Lactose Free)
   * Price: Rs2000 (Pack of 30 sachets)
   * Why: It is arguably the highest quality raw whey because it is 100% Native Whey (extracted directly from milk, not cheese byproduct). It is Lactose Free by default. The only catch? It tastes like milky water and is always sold out.
   * Best For: Purists who want the cleanest protein possible and have the patience to hunt for stock.

**""Digestion & Lactose Issues"" TIER**

For people who get gas, bloating, or acne from regular whey.

* MuscleBlaze Biozyme Performance Whey
   * Price: \~Rs2650
   * Why: This is the only Indian protein that is actually Clinically Tested for 50% higher absorption. They patented an enzyme blend specifically for Indian digestion. If other proteins make you bloated or gassy, this is the safest bet because your body absorbs more of it instead of letting it sit in your gut.
   * Best For: People with sensitive stomachs who want whey but are scared of the bloating.
* Isopure Low Carb Isolate
   * Price: \~Rs4990
   * Why: This is the best of isolates. It is 100% Whey Protein Isolate with virtually zero carbs and zero fillers. It is incredibly expensive (nearly 5k), but it is the cleanest, lightest protein you can buy. It mixes clear and has no lactose to upset your stomach.
   * Best For: Severe lactose intolerance, Keto dieters, or people with a high budget who want zero bloat.
* Cosmix (Plant Protein)
   * Price: \~Rs1995
   * Why: If you absolutely cannot do dairy, this is a No Nonsense plant protein that actually tastes decent (like the Mahabaleshwar Strawberry flavor). It is specifically marketed as Gut Friendly because it lacks the gums and heavy thickeners that make other vegan proteins taste like mud.
   * Best For: Vegans or people with severe dairy allergies who want a clean label.

**""No Chemicals/Additives"" TIER**

You read the label and hate seeing Sucralose, Xanthan Gum, or Artificial Flavors.

* The Whole Truth (TWT)
   * Price: \~Rs3400 (Flavored)
   * Why: They are obsessed with transparency. They don't just say No Added Sugar, they strictly use Monk Fruit instead of artificial sweeteners like sucralose. Their Light Cocoa flavor uses real cocoa and lists every single ingredient on the front. It is expensive, but it’s the only brand that promises Cleanest, Lightest Whey with zero chemicals.
   * Best For: Health conscious folks who have the budget and hate the chemical aftertaste of normal whey.
* Avvatar Raw (Unflavored)
   * Price: \~Rs2600
   * Why: It is the freshest option because it is Milked, Processed, and Packed within 24 hours. It has exactly ONE ingredient: Whey Protein Concentrate. No soy, no sugar, no flavors. You get full control to mix it with coffee or cocoa yourself.
   * Best For: Purists who want fresh, chemical free protein and can mix their own flavors.
* One Whole Nutrition (OWN)
   * Price: \~Rs2500
   * Why: As the name suggests, they strictly put ""Only What You Need."" Their Cocoa Concentrate is simple: 24g protein per scoop, no artificial flavors, and no fillers. They test every batch for 7 critical parameters (heavy metals etc.) and keep the price very reasonable for a clean-label product.
   * Best For: Minimalists who want a clean label without paying TWT's premium price.

**""Premium/International"" TIER**

You want brand value, consistent taste, and international reputation.

* Dymatize ISO 100 Hydrolyzed
   * Price: \~Rs13699 (5 lbs / 2.3 kg) which is approx Rs5950 per kg.
   * Why: It is Hydrolyzed (pre-digested), meaning it absorbs faster than any other whey on this list. It is super filtered to remove excess carbs, fat and lactose. If you are a pro athlete or just want the absolute best recovery money can buy, this is it.
   * Best For: Pros, people with weak digestion who need fast absorption, or those who buy in bulk (5lbs).
* Optimum Nutrition (ON) Gold Standard
   * Price: \~Rs6160 (1.7 kg)
   * Why: The industry standard. It works, tastes the same every time (Double Rich Chocolate is legendary), and has a massive global reputation.
   * Best For: People who want zero risk and consistent flavor.

Note: Prices listed are approximate and change daily based on sales/offers. If you think another brand deserves to be on this list (or if you've had a bad experience with one of these) drop a comment below so we can keep this updated.",14,1771257962.0,Fitness_India,13,0.94,False
1r6dku3,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r6dku3/the_simian_problem_part_1/,The Simian Problem (Part 1),"# JULY 12. 4:04 PM.

Jerry and Michael were already in the shed, and they were arguing as usual. 

“Why do you always have to be so negative all the time?” 

Michael bit into his meatball sub, squeezing the sides so tightly that I traced the flying glob of tomato sauce flying through the air. His teeth chewed on the hunks of meat in between buns of white bread, biting into the brown stained with sauce, some getting into his beard. “Awl I shed wash he probably doeshn’t dream ‘bout anything.” He swallowed. “What’s your deal?” 

Jerry’s face was equally as red as the tomato sauce. “Why do I have to be so negative–?” He turned to me. “Laura. Back me up here–” 

“Hi, Laura,” Michael interrupted. 

Jerry closed his eyes for a solid four seconds. Keeping his back to Michael, he ran a hand through his balding blond hair, pressing the palm tight against his pale forehead. It reminded me of an ironing board smoothing out the wrinkles on a crusty t-shirt. Jerry opened his eyes. “As I was saying–” 

“What’s up, Mike?” I responded. 

Jerry stomped his foot against the ground. “Fuck! Fuck! God fucking… would you just let me get one fucking word in? I swear to God, I’ll–” He was interrupted again as Mike dropped his sub to the floor, striding over to Jerry in two efficient steps, then using his own boot to crush down on Jerry’s stomping foot. Before Jerry could yell any further, Make clamped a hand over Jerry’s mouth, smearing a little sauce on Jerry’s round face. Mike held up a finger to his own mouth, shushing him.

I looked at Mike’s alarmed expression, then towards the window of the shack. 

The supply shack was about the size of a small garage. Big for a shed. Huge for a shed out here. Definitely fine enough for our purposes. It was made of pieces of rusted tin, hammered together to form four walls once painted a deep green. An automatic light hung outside the small door on the far side of the room, though its bulb had been removed long ago. The wall facing the street had small windows near the ceiling, allowing some sunlight to drift onto the concrete floor. The floor sloped downward against that same wall, more cracks and warps contributing to the dirtstained concrete until it reached a near vertical angle, stopping when it reached the very foundation of the wall. 

We waited in silence, Mike slowly removing his hands away from Jerry’s face. I crept over to the corner, grabbing a roll of paper towels from the carpenter’s table. While I scooped up the splattered sandwich, Mike creaked the door open. We all collectively grimaced, covering our dark-adjusted eyes. A gust of wind blew the short black hair on his forward, plastering it to his pale forehead. It tickled his beard, still stained with tomato sauce. Underneath his red baseball cap, his brown eyes scanned back and forth, then he stepped outside, inching the door shut behind him. 

Jerry leaned in to whisper: “I’m just saying, Laura, don’t you think Bob here… like, don’t you think he dreams?” 

“Stop talking, Jerry,” I replied, my eyes glued to the door. If I could will my ears to perk like an animal’s, I would.

He finally shut his mouth. 

We could hear Mike walking outside, his feet echoing off the driveway. He walked once around the shed, then paused at the door. He began to open it, his shadow spilling into the unilluminated room, then stopped, apparently reconsidering. He closed the door again, walking once more around the shed. I even heard him walk down the driveway, towards the street out front, before finally returning, definitively closing the door shut behind him as he re-entered the shed. 

Mike took a toothpick out from his green-gray duck chore coat, jaw flexing as he chewed on the tip. 

I gently placed the sub remains inside a trash bag, then tied it shut, setting it down next to the door so no one would forget to take it with them later. 

Jerry appeared unfazed. “Anyway,” he continued. “I was just saying that I think Bob, here–” 

“I thought we agreed on Stewart,” Michael grunted. 

“Fine. Stewart. Don’t you think he dreams?”

I looked at Stewart’s operating table. The shiny metal slab took up most of the room, sitting on locked wheels and holding up the body of the comatose man. He had deep brown hair, parted to the right. Stubble had grown over his tan face, and his narrow eyes darted frantically around his surroundings behind closed eyelids. I moved closer, shifting his body a little away from the edge of the table. Recoiling as I got near his diaper, I turned my nose away. 

Moving as quickly as I could, I took a syringe from my left pocket, and a vial of clear liquid from the other. I poked the needle through the lid, filling the syringe to the brim. I tapped the side, the metal *plinking* against my fingernail, as I cleared away the excess drips. Nodding to Jerry, he wordlessly crossed over to my side of the table, recoiling at the smell, too, as he held down Stewart’s arm to keep it as still as possible. Mike handed me a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol, and I swabbed the skin over a twisting, blue vein. Leaning in close, I sunk the needle into the skin at an angle, letting the tip enter Stewart’s bloodstream. 

I looked at Jerry and Michael as I drained the needle into him. “Isn’t the whole point that he does dream?” 

Jerry wrung his hands. “THANK YOU!” 

Michael rolled his eyes. “I meant, I don’t think he’s conscious of his dreams. Like, isn’t there a whole study that says you always dream when you sleep, but you pretty much never remember the majority of them?” 

“What difference does that make?” Jerry spluttered. “If he’s dreaming, he’s dreaming! I swear, you’re just disagreeing with me because it– it pleases you to be nihilistic. You always have to have the opposite opinion of me. Like, Laura, I think Stewart’s dreaming of a field of butterflies, and Michael…” 

“I think he’s experiencing what it’s like to be in the womb. Just some floating spirit not even aware of what the hell’s going on.” Michael finished. A shadow crossed his face. “But I’m not a nihilist.” 

I slid the needle out and placed it in a water basin. Then I picked up the copy of the Bible sitting on the shelf by the rusting metal door. I whacked both of them on the head with it before they could react. 

Jerry rubbed his head. “Hey!” 

“One of you needs to change his diaper. I did it yesterday.” 

Jerry and Mike looked at each other. They held out their hands for rock, paper, scissors. Mike was rock, Jerry was scissors. 

“Best of three?” Jerry tried. Mike shoved a clean diaper into his arms. Jerry sighed. He snapped on a pair of medical gloves and covered his face with a mask. I reached into the sink, squirting dish soap onto a yellow sponge before carefully running it over the needle. I kept the water pressure at a low, wishing again that I had access to better disinfectants. Michael fished his smartphone out of his pocket, turning the volume down to one before selecting an app that was playing the news. 

Over the quiet trickle of running water, I could just barely make out the reporter’s voice coming out from the phone’s speaker. “More bodies in Jordan as alleged border disputes with The United Arab Emirates escalates to an unprecedented–” Mike swiped, switching to a different news station. “--Twenty-three Texas school children dead in Tentuskiville shooting–” Swipe. “--Kremlin officials deny ethnic cleansing allegations made by six members of the U.N. Security Council in regards to the Russian controlled state of–” Swipe. “--Refugees escaping in droves as more of the Mediterranean coastline is swallowed by rising sea levels. When asked if any cities in the United States would be made sanctuaries, the president responded–”

Mike stared at his reflection in the black screen of his phone. Jerry sniffed, eyes frozen on Stewart. He whispered something under his breath. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Piece of shit,” He said again, a little louder. Jerry threw the diaper into the bag, then laid trembling hands on the edge of the operating table. “Piece of shit!” He started shaking it violently, cheeks flushed and eyes rimmed with red. 

“Jerry!” I shouted. Mike and I locked eyes, and we rushed to Jerry’s side, tackling him to the floor. Jerry was still thrashing violently, teeth gritted and palms sweating. Mike squeezed his arm around his mouth, trying to stop him from making any noise. 

“Shh!” He hissed.

I held Jerry’s other arm down, pressing it against the cold, uneven concrete floor. Then he kicked his foot, hitting the leg of the table. It began to roll across the room, down a steady downwards slope. 

We immediately dropped Jerry, rushing to intercept the speeding table. I grabbed its side, grunting as I tried to keep the metal slab with the heavier man on top from sliding any further. Mike dashed to the other side, pulling it with his arms. Stewart’s body slid precariously to the edge, almost rolling over on top of me. I reached my arms up, steadying the man. We rolled the table back into place, Michael edging Stewart back to his position in the center. 

This time, it was my turn to check outside. 

The sun beat down on me as soon as I stepped out the door. I squinted, trying to see anything past the glare of the day. Even though the sun was low in the sky, there were no houses to block it from blinding me. I began to slowly circle the shed, looking around me at the miles of the same old overgrown, abandoned development project. It was the outline of a neighborhood, with sun-stained sidewalks, cracked driveways, and empty foundations. There were no cars, though. No wires, no telephone poles, streetlamps, houses, or thankfully, people. The shed itself sat on an identical lot filled with weeds and scattered bushes. My guess was that this belonged to someone before the land even started development. And it was still here after. 

I wasn’t as paranoid as Mike. I elected to only walk around the shed once. In the far distance, beyond the concrete nothingness, I could see the grove of trees where we parked our cars, though the vehicles themselves were hidden from my line of sight. If anyone had heard our noises, they were either hiding over there, or they weren’t here at all. There was no possible way to sneak up on us in this place. 

That didn’t stop us from being careful. 

When I came back inside, Jerry was still on the floor, hugging his knees. He looked tearfully at Mike and I. “Is he still asleep?” 

I approached the operating table. Stewart’s eyes were still closed, still rapidly moving underneath his eyelids. I walked around, gently gripping his head as I used my other hand to lay two fingers on his neck. I nodded to Mike, who raised his arm, checking his watch. I felt the thumping of Stewart’s heart, and I closed my eyes, counting in my head. Jerry drew in a long breath, then got up, moving towards the basin, where he picked up the needle, holding the bottle at the ready. 

The watch beeped. Mike looked up at me. 

“Thirty-nine BPM. Still asleep.”

Mike breathed a sigh of relief. Jerry slumped over, holding his head in his hands. 

I pulled up a stool, releasing a long exhale through my nose. I sat down, letting my shoulders sag. Even as my posture relaxed, I couldn’t help but let my head trail up, looking past the operating table with the still-asleep Stewart, past Jerry, who was lying on the floor and staring straight up at the water-damaged ceiling, and past Mike, who was finishing putting on the diaper. My eyes fell past all of them and onto the space just above the doorway to the shed, to the message scrawled messily in red paint. The one I forced myself to look at every single day.

WE ARE BETTER OFF WITH HIM ASLEEP. 

# JULY 12. 7:33 PM. 

I muttered a goodbye to Mike and Jerry, then I started the four block walk to my car. Even though it was past seven, it was still ninety-six degrees out.  I rubbed sunscreen on my face as I walked, shoes slapping against the sidewalk pavement. My arm brushed the dead bush that lay at the end of the walkway to the shed, then I turned right, onto the street. Cicadas drowned out the sounds of the birds in the trees. I looked behind, and saw Jerry leaning against the shed wall, brushing a sweaty strand of hair out from his face. Even though we both had nightshifts, he wouldn’t leave for at least another thirty minutes. It was important to stagger our departures. 

The sun wasn’t radiating light over the abandoned lots anymore. The gray shade of the evening permeated the empty development project, now. My shadow, split into two, blackened the already black concrete. I reached into my purse, feeling the cool lenses of the sunglasses tossed inside. Even when I was here in the middle of the day, I never liked wearing them out here. The dark tint felt like it was hiding someone. Crouching in the bushes, waiting for me to be all alone. A someone that had somehow walked all the way out here to the center of nothingness, avoided all of our regular checks outside, whose purpose was to keep themselves impossibly hidden, watching us. Waiting. 

Our cars were scattered around the lone patch of grass amongst the oak trees. Mike’s black SUV, my own white sedan, and Jerry’s shining metal cybertruck. Real inconspicuous. 

I opened the driver’s side door to my own car, turning the key in the ignition and immediately switching on the AC. I closed the door, waiting outside as the car cooled. Whatever hellish temperature it was out here, it was always going to be twenty degrees higher in the car. My phone rang, and I immediately picked it up. 

Mike’s voice sounded tired. “Ready to keep going?” 

“Put me on with him.” 

“Alright.” I heard shuffling, and then Mike said, sounding further away: “Go ahead.” 

I tried to put on the calm, reassuring voice I used with the residents at Shady Grove. “Hi, Stewart. Can you hear me?” 

There was no answer, as expected. I heard his quiet breathing through the speaker. Mike must’ve placed the phone pretty close to his face today. As if the centimeter difference to his brain would make matter. I thought it would be best to make it seem like we were having a normal conversation, even if it was one-sided. If he could hear me in there, it would be good to establish a relationship of trust. 

“You’re speaking to Laura, right now. Are you having a pleasant dream?” 

I let my question hang in the air. Sandwiching my phone between my shoulder and ear, I fished out a cigarette, putting it in my mouth as I got out the matches. The first one was a dud. I dropped the spent match on the ground, digging it in with my heel, then realized what I had done. 

“Shit.” I kneeled down, trying not to get my uniform dirty. 

“Laura?” Mike’s voice was still far away. “All good?” 

“Yup. Yeah, Mike,” I said, grabbing the match from the grass. I opened the door, sliding into the driver’s seat as I flicked the match into a plastic bag tied around the gear stick. Connecting the call to the vehicle’s bluetooth, I started pulling out of my parking spot.

“Stewart,” I continued. “I ask about your dream because I wanted to talk to you about something called lucid dreaming. Do you know what that is? Instead of the foggy memory of your dream after you wake up, you can become aware of the dream while you’re… well, while you’re in it.” 

I backed out onto the road, swinging a left and accelerating. “And some people who lucid dream, like, who realize that they’re dreaming while they’re still in the dream, can actually control what happens in it. So you could do whatever you want, Stewart. You could fly. You could relive your childhood memories.” I checked my rearview mirror. “You could even talk… um, you could even talk…” 

I heard Mike breathe through his nose. “Laura, this isn’t going to work.” 

“Isn’t it worth trying?” I asked. 

“We’ve been doing this every single day. Aren’t you getting tired? God, I mean, I can hear it in your voice. What was that?” 

“It’s just hard, okay?” I snapped, not meaning to sound as irritable as my tone came out, but it’d been a long day, and it was just getting started. As usual. “This whole thing is crazy. Excuse me if it's a little hard to spit out.” 

Michael didn’t say anything. I mentally chided myself, watching the abandoned lots give away to the sight of the groundlevel freeway. We couldn’t let cracks form. Not now. Not after so long, and so little time left. 

I let ourselves sit in silence for a little while. The truth was, we had no idea if any of this was getting to Stewart. We thought that Stewart’s brain activity was normal. A patient in comatose might be able to hear communication from the outside world, depending on if their brain was still functioning as intended. It was impossible to tell for Stewart, except for the fact that he was still alive. Yeah, I could get basic tools like syringes from Shady Grove, but nothing close to something like an MRI machine. 

As I entered the highway, Mike’s voice resonated through the car. “Are we going to talk about Jerry?” 

 “What’s there to talk about?” 

“You know what.”

“It’s an emotional job, Mike.” 

“No, you get emotional. Jerry–”

“Excuse me?” I said, looking wide-eyed at the phone symbol on the car screen. 

“I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean, your behavior around this– mine, too– that’s normal. We’re bound to get a little stir-crazy from time-to-time, but we keep going, y’know? But stir-crazy is one thing. Going ape-shit on the guy that’s supposed to stay asleep no matter what is another.” 

I watched the light get lower in the sky as mist began to settle on the road. Luckily there were no cars around, but I found myself thankful that I had actually gotten my ass to the mechanic last week to get my low beams fixed. My talk with Mike was beginning to feel like a conversation I had with one of the residents. I forced my voice to be patient. “I’ve seen what we’re giving him in action. If a fraction of that is enough to lull a crazy old bitch to a gentle nap, Stewart wouldn’t wake for the end of the world with what he’s getting.” 

“It’s not just that. What if someone heard?” Mike replied. 

“Who’s going to hear?”

“You never know. Besides–” 

His voice said something loud, maybe urgent. But… what was that? There was something on the road in front me. A pair of white lights, two pinpricks much too small to belong to a car. They stared at me in the other lane as I loosened my foot on the gas. They shone through the fog, piercing through the rolling haze like the sun entering a cave. But this was cold. My eyes were unable to blink as I shivered uncontrollably. Stings of pain began to blot out my vision, tears streaming down my face. I felt the groans of the highway underneath me as I entered the lane separation, the vehicular concrete clawing at the hot rubber of my wheels telling me to turn back. 

The lights were eyes. Terrible, blinding eyes, the result of two needles taken to thick black construction paper and held in front of a brilliant lantern. And the fog was crawling into my car, tendrils of it seeping through the miniscule gap in my windows, foggy fingers groping from within the depths of the air conditioning vent, pure, frosty terror creeping from the crack in my windshield. My fingers burned with cold, feeling frozen to the steering wheel. But my arms slowly turned it. Creeping towards the black silhouette with the white eyes with sickening odyssean lust. 

The black silhouette was crouched, eyes boring into mine. Not even my very, very close headlights could illuminate their features. But I could see their current height well superseding my car. At least six feet tall. Like a shadow manifest. A cold, black shadow. The sky without stars. 

Turn back. Turn back. 

My vision cleared. I swung the wheel the opposite direction, almost snapping my arm with the force of my whiplash. The car squealed, and burning rubber filled my nose, making me gag. I slammed the gas, driving, driving. The fog was so thick. Mike was saying something, but the bluetooth was distorted. It cut off his sentences, leaving periods of silence intercut with hoarse, gasping breaths. 

“Mike,” I rasped, feeling like I needed to cough. “M–”

My car slammed into the broad trunk of a tree. My phone toppled from the cupholder, falling flat on the floor of the car and ending the call. My head slammed forward with the impact, hitting the steering wheel before my airbag activated. A shrill ringing filled my ears. For a second, I had to fight myself to stay awake. I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. I felt sick, vomit threatening to spill through my throat, simultaneously as my head throbbed. 

I sat up, ignoring the possible concussion I had sustained. I took a deep breath, slowly blinking to steady my vision. My windshield was cracked, well, even more than it already had been.  The hood of my car was crumpled like a tin can. 

“Fuck,” I whispered, stifling a sob. 

How the hell was I gonna afford a new car? My salary was already a fucking joke. I had bills to pay. Groceries to buy. And… 

Had that really happened? 

I turned the car off, not that it really mattered anymore. Pushing the airbag out of the way, I groped around the dark car for my phone. Picking it up, I ran my thumb along its shattered screen. At least it still turned on. I thought about what I would do next. As far as I knew, there weren’t any other cars on the road, and definitely no speed cameras. No one had seen what had just happened. I hung up an incoming call from Mike. Time to get out and ring AAA. 

I reached for the door handle, then stopped. There were noises on the roof of the car. 

They were loud, banging one after the other, in slow, rhythmic succession. It sounded like footsteps. I waited to hear them hop onto the back of the trunk, then onto the road. I even craned my neck, wincing at a bruise that had developed right below my ear. But I didn’t see them. In fact, the footsteps didn’t stop. They circled on top of the car. 

My heart began to pound, and I released my breath, not realizing I had been holding it. I absorbed every minute detail of my car. The white cushion of the airbag protruded from the steering wheel. An old coffee cup had fallen to the ground, cold liquid dripping onto the carpeted floor. In the back row was my black duffel bag, inside it was some extra vials of what we fed Stewart, and his IV bag. We planned to transition him to the drip diet once we got some more supplies. For now, we did our best by forcing blended food down his throat. Mike always had a crash bag ready if he started choking. 

I looked out the back window, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the perfect dark. Waiting to see whoever was on my roof appear on the other side. 

My phone rang. 

The blue lit up the entire car. I saw Mike’s name appear like a prehistoric blaze of fire. I gasped as the beating of my chest skipped a hundred years. I heard a tap and I looked and I saw the black silhouette of someone with white glowing eyes peering down at me perched on the roof of my car penetrating and looking into my head with curiosity and unknowability and something that felt like the cold pangs of hunger jab into the inside of my spine. My scream drowned out the phone’s ringtone and the stranger shot their head back. I heard a slam, saw my car’s roof crunch downwards, felt myself close my eyes. 

I knew it could only have been a few seconds later when I opened them. The phone was still ringing. I looked out the window. Nothing. I listened. The roof was quiet. Dazed, I groped around on the floor, taking a few tries before my trembling hands picked the phone up. I slid the answer bar to the right. 

“Laura? Laura, are you there?” Mike sounded panicked. 

I swallowed. “Y-” My voice came out too quiet. “Yeah. Yeah.” Instinctively, I felt my pulse. 

“Laura, I swear to god I fucking saw–” He cut himself off. “Wait, what happened? Are you okay? Did I hear something on your end? You hung up on me.” 

“Um… yeah.” I tried to keep myself calm, focusing on counting the pulse rate. “I got into an accident.” 

“Oh, my god. Are you okay?” Mike’s voice became flat. Neutral. “I’m going to need you to answer my questions for me, okay, Laura?” 

“Oh my god, Mike.” Ten over one hundred. “I’m okay.” 

His voice was calm, but stern. “Are you bleeding?” 

I checked myself again. Just the bruise on my neck. A scrape on my forehead that had already scabbed over. “No.” 

“Was there anyone else in the car with you?” 

“Mike! It was obviously just me!” I didn’t mean to snap at him. Again. I was on edge. The precipice of a razorblade. 

“I’m trying to get a clear picture, right now, Laura. That’s all. Do you feel dizzy? Is your vision blurry?” 

I blinked. “I think I have a small concussion. I’m okay, really.” 

He sighed. “No, you’re not. You need to get that checked out, right away.” 

“Mike! What the fuck happened? Why did you call me?” I squinted, trying to physically recall what happened before my accident with the man in the fog. “Did I hear you yell?”

He hesitated. “It’s probably nothing. I just… I thought I saw Stewart’s lips move.” 

I sat up in my seat. 

“Did you catch what he was saying?” 

“Laura, I don’t know. I don’t know what I saw. I’m more concerned about you.” 

“Mike. What did he say?” 

He took an even longer time to answer. When he finally did, I sat in my car for a long time, still by the side of the highway, watching the shadows. Counting numbers in my head. Thinking. 

“I thought… I thought I saw him mouth ‘help’.”",1,1771257891.0,horrorstories,1,1.0,False

I've been working from home with a wife and three kids for four and a half year. Somedays I like it and can help out in the house a bit, especially in the summer when they are home. Other days, I find it really annoying because my kids can be loud and my house isn't big enough for me to truly have an office of my own.

I have very little desire to switch jobs because the place I work for, though located more than halfway across the country, is terrified and I work working with them.

I have started to get out of the house more frequently after buying a decent laptop, but part of my challege is that most of my calls are unscheduled and could easily take place while I am at a coffee shop or somewhere besides home.

At the moment, I have Razer Barracuda X's that are basically a gaming headset  - these are also somewhat custom painted by my 12 year old and weren't really intended to be on camera.

Are there good headsets out there that look a little more professional that would work decent in a potentially noisy coffee shop?

  
I could spend a couple of hundred dollars, as I am using company funds. I do NOT want earbuds as they always fall out - my ears aren't exactly small and I just have bad history with them.",1,1771257666.0,HeadphoneAdvice,1,1.0,False

1r6dews,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1r6dews/scheduled_activity_its_all_in_an_adventuring_day/,[Scheduled Activity] It’s All in an Adventuring Day,"*Starting a series about different parts of games we design.*

RPGs didn’t start out with the concept of an Adventuring Day. Back in the dawn of the hobby, characters started out fresh, did things that made them use up resources, and then slowly rebuilt those resources over time.  And those resources reset or rebuilt at different rates. Or, I suppose, *they died*.

Sure, you might get your spells back overnight, but hit points? Heal one per day, and not even always that. And heaven forbid if you ever fell to “death’s door” (if that rule was even in play, a lot of early roleplaying was you were either fine or … dead).

And some games didn’t even have resources to track. You had to rest or sleep, but there was nothing to even reset.

In the beginning, there was largely a sense of “you start in a safe environment, do dangerous things after journeying from that safe space, and you pick yourself up when you get back to it.” And that is where we start to see the idea of an adventuring day, even though the “day” was over only when you got back home. It should really be thought of as an “adventure” at this point.

Early games knew how this worked, especially in the world of computer games. “Rest until healed” was an option in Pools of Radiance, where your healers would prepare nothing but heals, and the game would advance time by having them use those spells until the whole group was filled up.

Over time, this idea became more codified. In the early days, it’s unlikely that there was a formal notion of it. We see a concept of it forming around the 3E era where you’d have resources easily available, such as wands of cure X.

And in 4th edition, this became officially something the game acknowledged. When you completed a Long Rest you were back in business and ready to go again.

This is looking at things through a D&D lens, of course. Other games had vastly different ways of treating the “day” from resetting things at the end of a session to having modes of play where you had pre and post adventure activities built in. And some games dealt with the issue by having no resources to track at all.

That’s a long-winded way to introduce this week’s topic: the adventuring day. Does your game have a notion of that? If so, how do you track it? Is it a meta “per session” idea? A “have X encounters and then a full reset?"" A grind? Or modes of play where you track all of this outside of the main play loop? Or, as many of you may say, is this just not necessary to think about?

How does a day start in your game? As I’m writing this, my game has started the way it does every day, with coffee. So grab a cuppa, and …

I was diagnosed with celiac in 2012, so have been dealing with it for a while. Reading labels is getting so frustrating recently. It feels like natural flavoring is in everything now, and it’s being added to more things than necessary. 

Separately, I’m getting really frustrated with trying to maintain somewhat normalcy and eating out. On Saturday, we had lunch with friends at a “safe” restaurant. They confirmed they have designated fryers, had a separate location to prep, would wash hands and change gloves. (I should note that I don’t react often to cross contact.) Within 30 minutes I was sick. 

I feel like I’ve been having gluten reactions for weeks. I did a deep dive (bad idea) and really don’t know what to trust anymore. Is the coffee I made at home \*actually\* safe? What about the compostable fork, plate, straw, that I used last week?

I finally got around to getting a blood test and got my results just now. My doctor is saying that my ferritin level Is SEVEN which is insane to me.

i know that 70+ is optimal for stopping hair loss, and my iron is 80 and hemoglobin is about 13.5 so my main issues he says is ferritin and zinc, I just dont know what else to do when I’m already taking a multivitamin and the ferrous sulfate daily.

    You know how much I love merry-go-rounds, right? After launching yourself off of one still moving, you step on one leg uncertain. You're a blur of limbs and grass stains. You collapse backwards, a collection of giggles and gratitude for the lack of sprained body parts as you wait for the room to stop spinning. 

Then you look up. You find you were the only one spinning and the sky is there, certain and still. The grass beneath you carries all of your weight, effortlessly. ""As above, so below.""

I know I can handle them because I'm not handling them alone.

Recently however our SM has been getting onto everyone a lot more about random things. It wouldn’t bother me if they were consistent and we could all know what to expect, but lately it feels like we’re all walking on eggshells at our store. 

They’ve talked to partners about “having an attitude” when they just aren’t smiling as much as they would like them to. 

They’ve been cracking down on time and attendance, questioning the legitimacy of people’s call outs even though everyone was getting sick from flu/covid/upper respiratory germs that normally go around this time of year. I was sat down for a verbal coaching because I had used up my sick time and had mentioned that I was probably getting sick again. Basically I was told that I was on the verge of getting written up if I called out again, which left me stuck between calling out when I’m legitimately sick, or coming in while I’m still symptomatic. I was told I could ask for an accommodation because I have school age children and when one of them gets sick I usually have to call out. Of course that accommodation was not approved. 

Most recently, I was sat down for a verbal coaching/warning because of a negative google review of our store that was about a month and a half old. I was told that because the customer specified date and time they were able to deduce that it was about me. The customer complained that I didn’t say anything to them and that I was “rude” and that I rolled my eyes. 

This review was from the week of Christmas. Sandwiched between majority positive reviews. I am autistic and struggle to always control my facial expressions and when I looked back at the timing, it was in the last thirty minutes of my shift, so I very well could have been less than enthusiastic. I never would intentionally roll my eyes at a customer though, and I also struggle with knowing when people interpret me as rolling my eyes vs me looking up and then down…

I told my SM that I don’t really know what I can do differently because I didn’t even know I was being rude to the customer who left a poor review. I was then told that “maybe this isn’t the position for me” if I can’t do better. 

I’m just exhausted by constantly feeling like I’m on the edge of getting written up, but also not always knowing when something I do is worthy of a write up or not. It feels like a minefield and way more stress than necessary when we’re literally serving glorified fast food coffee for a paycheck that isn’t even really a living wage.

We have already reserved the lodging for each stay so now we have the pressure to make each of our planned stops. We used 12mph average as a planning tool to navigate our day with the idea we would have a few stops for snacks, coffee, lunch and sight seeing.

\- Night 1: Paganico 77 mile marker

\- Night 2: Torrenieri: 131 mile marker

\- Night 3: Castellina in Chianti: 198 mile marker

\- Night 4: Prato D’ Ora: 262 mile marker

All four have the “No Stress” registration and packet pick-up on May 20 in the AM. We plan to start riding no later than 11:00.

Question, planned to park our van with miscellaneous luggage in the designated parking areas. I assume this is authorized for the five days out on the trail.

Looking forward to a great adventure and enjoying all Tuscany has to offer along the route.

Thanks to Doogie 1142 for starting the thread.

Special thanks to Djordje\_127 for the great article. Super helpful. Good luck to all.

Cheers,

But I went back home last month to visit family for a couple weeks, and honestly it was one of the weirdest feelings I've ever had. Like, this is the place I grew up, the streets I walked down every day for 20+ years, and suddenly it all felt... unfamiliar? Like I was a tourist in my own hometown.

My favorite coffee shop changed owners and the vibe is completly different now. Half my old friends have moved away or are so busy with kids/careers that we barely hung out. Even just walking around downtown felt strange, like I didn't quite belong anymore.

The worst part is my parents kept asking when I'm moving back ""for good"" and I realized I don't even think of it as home anymore. That kinda hit different.

Anyone else gone through something similar? How did you deal with it? I feel guilty for not feeling more attached to the place I grew up.",16,1771257080.0,CasualConversation,9,1.0,False

# Painting Passions

Isabelle’s passion for painting was an emotion rivaled only by her absolute loathing for losing. She was the avatar for this first emotion, her rival Scotty, the epitome of her ire. He always won. Always!

In their first contest, she had turned in a work of true brilliance. In it, she had portrayed herself as Icarus, where she chased the sun across the sky with a butterfly net. Scotty’s work depicted a nonsense girl chasing nonsense things; it was too abstract to have any true merit. Yet, the judges had viewed his work, looked back at her, smiled, and then proceeded to award him first place.

It was all rigged. Had to be. That was why they had looked at her the way they had. Their smile had been a smirk. They were saying that she wasn’t going to win. They were saying that her efforts didn’t matter. *Well, we’ll see about that, won’t we?*

In her next painting, she was Sisyphus. Only, she was a mighty golden dragon who pushed a globe up a slope. She imagined that the globe was her creativity and that the judges were up top awaiting to appraise it. Well, once she got it up there, she was going to shove it down their throats. There was no chance they wouldn’t see her brilliance this time.

Isabelle’s fist closed around the heart-shaped pendant of her necklace. She always wore it for luck—a gift from her mother. Despite her confidence, she stood in the gallery’s hall, all nerves and uncertainty. Waiting was the worst part. Waiting to see the results posted. Waiting to see her appraised worth.

When the judges announced and unveiled the winner, Isabelle’s breath caught. But that wasn’t quite right. She was still breathing. No, it was her heart; it had stopped. In the same moment, her eyes welled up, and her fists balled as she pivoted and hurried out of the gallery.

That night, she sobbed before a blank canvas. The winner had been a painting of a giant girl stooping to look at a fire. There was no doubt in her mind about who had painted it. It had that same stupid abstract-dream quality. First place was a real-world prize, yet he was winning with abstract work. It didn’t make sense.

She had put all of this extra effort and research into making her work as real as possible. Had modeled her dragon after real lizards. Had depicted her Icarus wings like those of real birds. Wasn’t that the point? To make the work as real as possible? And yet she somehow kept losing to dreams. How was his abstract beating her realism?

Isabelle wore the sweatshirt her mom used to paint in—its sleeves too marred with old paint to begrudge the tears she had wiped away. If realism didn’t matter, none of it did. She would paint what she wanted to. And so she did.

Everything Isabelle had become was because of her mother. The necklace, the shirt, the paint, all of it was a cause that Isabelle had taken up on her mom’s behalf. Her earliest memories were near the base of her mom’s easel, an easel that she had also inherited. And just because her mom was no longer around, that didn’t mean she was no longer here. For as long as Isabelle painted, her mom was painting too.

Soon, a depiction of her mom reached down from the top of her canvas. It was like Michelangelo’s work showing God and Adam reaching towards one another. Only, her depiction showed a paintbrush passing from mother to daughter—daughter, who stood before a canvas, her mother perched on a cloud. At least, that was her sketch. When she added color, the paintbrush became the body of a butterfly, its wings stretching out as the horizon that separated Isabelle from her mother.

The next time the contest came around, things were different. Instead of curling into a ball of anxiety, Isabelle walked around the gallery. Past winners hung about the space, which meant she also encountered Scotty’s recent wins. She idly massaged her pendant as she looked over his work.

The first image showed a girl running, but it also showed something she hadn’t noticed before. The girl wore a necklace, which she guarded. Whatever animosity Isabelle previously held, it was gone now. She could actually appreciate his work. It really was good. She could even sympathize with the girl in it. They both had something precious, which they guarded.

In his next work, a small boy stood in the foreground with a torch held aloft. A girl’s face emerged from the surrounding darkness, her giant silhouette crouching while mostly obscured by shadow. The fire’s light flickered in her pupils as she leaned close, a pendant dangling from her neck—a pendant with a heart’s shape.

Isabelle’s breath hitched.

“I saw your painting,” someone said.

She spun to find a brown-haired boy, his build slight, his hands in his pockets, his gaze askant—Scotty.

“It’s really good,” he said without meeting her gaze. “This time, you’ll win for sure.”

“Th—thank you,” she replied.

“Well, I can tell you put a lot—”

“No,” she interrupted, stepping near him and orienting on his paintings. “I didn’t see it before, but I do now. So, thank you.”

Scotty met her gaze, then looked away again. He sighed. “I didn’t know how else to say it. You wouldn’t... You know? Want to go out sometime?”

“There’s a cafe around the corner. Buy me a coffee?”

“Of course! When?”

Isabelle hooked her arm into his. “I’m free now.”

“But the results...”

“Doesn’t matter. I didn’t paint to win; I painted to share something important. Whatever comes of that is for other people to decide. So...coffee?”

As the judges emerged to post the results, Isabelle and Scotty stepped out into sunshine.

Here's what I learned about trust in this space.","I need to get something off my chest because I think a lot of you have been through something like this and nobody talks about it.

I'm a 9 to 5 guy who builds after hours. Every night after work I sit down and keep pushing on my project. It's slow. It's exhausting. But it's mine and I care about it deeply.

A few weeks ago a guy in our founders group reached out to me. Said he really liked what I was building. Complimented the project. Then offered me a tool he made that connects to your GitHub to do ""code reviews.""

I almost gave him access to my actual repos.

Something felt off though. I can't explain it logically. Just a gut feeling. So instead I connected his tool to a throwaway account with nothing real in it.

I kept being cool with him after that. Encouraged his work. Wished him happy birthday. Invited him into our private founders channel. Treated him the way I try to treat every builder I meet which is with genuine support because this journey is hard enough already.

Then yesterday I'm scrolling LinkedIn and I see a video from this same guy. He's demoing a tool. And it looks almost identical to what I've been building. Not similar in the way that two people solve the same problem differently. Similar in the way that makes your stomach drop.

I sat there staring at my screen for a while.

And I'm not going to pretend that didn't hurt. It did. Because I actually believe in helping other founders. That's not something I perform for content. That's just how I operate.

Now look. I understand how this works. Ideas are not unique. Two people can absolutely arrive at the same solution independently. That happens every single day and it's completely normal.

But that's not what this was. And if you've ever been in this situation you already know the difference. You can feel it.

This experience taught me something I think every founder in here needs to hear especially if you're early and you're excited and you want to share everything with everyone.

Your openness is a strength. But it's also a vulnerability.

I finally understand why so many builders go quiet. Why people stop sharing progress. Why the smartest founders I know are extremely selective about who gets to see what they're working on before it's live.

But here's where I landed after sitting with this for a day.

Am I afraid of someone copying what I build?

No. And I mean that.

Because anyone can copy features. Anyone can copy a landing page. Anyone can screenshot your UI and hand it to a designer. Anyone can take your idea and try to build their own version.

But nobody can copy your taste. The way you think about the problem. The relationships you've built over months and years of showing up honestly. The persistence that keeps you building at 11pm after a full workday. That obsession with getting the details right that nobody else even notices.

They cannot copy you. And that's not a motivational poster. That's the actual competitive advantage.

So here's how this story ends.

He lost access to a group of people who genuinely wanted to see him succeed. People who would have helped him grow. People who would have shared connections and feedback and support freely.

And I got something valuable too. Clarity about who belongs in my circle and who doesn't.

If you're building something right now and you're doing it the right way, with honesty, with integrity, with real effort, protect that energy. Be generous but be smart about it. Trust your gut when something feels off. And don't let one bad experience turn you into someone who stops helping people.

The sun is for everyone. Just be a fair player.

Curious if anyone else has dealt with something like this. How do you handle trust with other founders especially in early stages when your idea is still fragile? Would love to hear your stories.

Also if you're a founder who wants to be around builders who actually support each other we do a casual Coffee and Build session where people show what they're working on and get real feedback from other founders. No pitch decks. No fluff. Just real people building real things. ",5,1771256986.0,Entrepreneur,7,1.0,False

I must admit I don't really like it. The user Interface is not only different than all other square testers, but it is very cumbersome to use and needs a lot of unneccessary key presses. 



If the Cloner clones almost everything: the shape and looks of the device, the main screen, the functionality (all other do that), why then don't they copy the operation of the device itself, which is quite good? The other clones mix up the left and OK button, but at least on the Ryken X3 you can change that. But making navigation completely different and also having to go to a menu instead of directly to the screens is idiotic. 

  
Apart from that it works just like the other testers, the cable resistance seems to be o.k. - it is within 10% range of the Treedix measurements. And it is almost double that of the other testers with kelvin module which makes me think it also measures ""round trip"" values and not only one direction. Of course none of the companies say what it actually measures, so I am not sure how useful this feature is.

Kinta is the name I use for Mustard btw:

""Wait, there's a history between you?"" Itsuka worriedly questioned as Shinso and Neito glared at each other.

""Yep, there's lore,"" Kinta nodded.

""You are such a fucking nerd, holy shit,"" Tetsu sneered as he placed his arms on the coffee table set up in the middle of Midnight's apartment.

""Hey, we're guests in his home!"" Kendo whisper yelled. Seizing Tetsu, she dug her fingers into his forearm.

""What else am I supposed to ask, you asshole?"" Kinta leaned over the table towards him.

Aoyama looked between the couples and stag. As the current card tzar for their game of cards against humanity, he felt a compulsion to do something. He opened his mouth and made a weird noise before croaking, ""Um...maybe we shouldn't-""

But Neito interrupted him, ""Oh, yes...the story of how Hitoshi here decided it was fine and dandy to hitch himself to my eldest sister after our break up,"" he said all of this while raising his hands like he were recounting a grand ballad about a Shakespearian tragedy.

Himiko smiled at this, her fangs shining as she tilted her head towards a deadpan Shinso, ""It was a major plot twist when I found out.""

""What a dick!"" Tetsu and Kinta yelled dually. They looked at each other in surprise while Kendo covered her face.

Shinso held his several cards in one hand and balled his free one into a fist. ""Good god...Neito, I didn't know she was your sister!"" with every word that fist shook ever so slightly.

""He said while lying!"" Neito barked.

""Perhaps it is better for the past to be buried,"" Aoyama said, placing a gentle hand upon Neito's shoulder. ""How long has it been, seven months?""

""...Should...we...leave?"" Tetsu whispered awkwardly, at an uncharacteristically genuine loss for words. He glanced to Itsuka, who had leaned forward and was watching this unfold like those romance novels Yaomomo would share with her. She folded her hands together and held them up to her mouth.

""Just like auntie..."" Kinta murmured. He wasn't wrong for Nemuri was watching this from around the corner of the nearby hallway. She was even eating around a bag of nacho cheese dorito's grabbed from the fun pack Tetsu brought.

""You guys would give relationship therapists PTSD,"" Kinta grunted, shaking his head.

""Who asked you, no girlfriend haver?"" Toga hissed as she turned her head towards him.

""Maybe you should all stop whining about who's dating who and start the solo life. An alpha like me could teach you a thing or two,"" Kinta pointed a thumb at his chest and smirked.

Dead silence.

Until Nemuri broke it, ""I'll be putting your personal effects out on the curb tomorrow.""

Then Monoma was back to being angry as if that whole scenario hadn't just taken place. He snarled at Toga, ""And you...""

""And me\~"" Himiko sang.

""This is serious!"" Neito roared. ""You knew too-""

""Sometimes, I wish I did,"" Himiko stuck her tongue out at him. 

""Liar!""

""This is stupid,"" Shinso sighed, placing a hand to his face. 

""You could fight it out,"" Tetsu suggested, putting a fist into his palm. ""Trial by combat, whoever wins is right.""

""Who would be fighting?"" Kendo glanced over at him.

""Momoma and his sis,"" Tetsu pointed double fingers at the siblings. 

""Not in my pad they won't!"" Kinta shook his head. ""Aoyama-San's right, why don't you just let the past be the fucking past? This shit's been going on for months.""

""Advice from mister alpha..."" Himiko murmured.

He threw up his hands, ""O-Oh, so you're content with fighting your brother about relationship bullshit until the end of time? It's real peachy to obsess over a dead relationship,"" he looked at a scowling Monoma, ""and laugh about dating your brothers former boyfriend, whether you knew or not, as if that isn't insanely fucked up either way!""

Dead silence once more. Himiko held her mouth open, Neito shivered with rage. Shinso dropped his cards and brought both hands to his face. Midnight turned back to the hallway where she'd been coming out with Kinta's belongings tied into a sack on a stick. 

Yuga was the only one who smiled and said, ""Maybe you could be a little formal with your speech Kinta-Kun, but...I agree. This is getting to be a little ridiculous.""

""He said, she said, buncha crap,"" Tetsu commented.

""Project more why don't you?"" Himiko hissed at Kinta. ""This coming from the same boy who's totally into me by the way.""

""Yes, exactly!"" Neito nodded his head and pointed an accusatory finger at him, ""you hypocritical goblin boy!""

""...Well at least you jackasses are finally united on something,"" Kinta grunted.

Grasping her sleeve, Shinso jolted Himiko who turned to face him, ""Lets...just go, okay?""

She looked at him, then the rest of the audience, ""What? but-""

""The nights been ruined as is.""

""We can still-""

""Come on.""

Neito glared as he watched them leave, audible breaths going into and out of his nose.

When the door shut, the room was quiet. However, it was eventually broken by Aoyama, ""My apologies, we shouldn't have brought this to game night.""

""N-No,"" Itsuka shook her head, ""it's our fault for inviting those two. I had no idea you and Shinso had history Neito-Kun, sorry.""

""It's alright,"" Neito was breating in and out, clearly still upset.

""...Should we like...take a break or somethin?"" Tetsu grunted sheepishly after another moment passed.

""No duh,"" Kinta sputtered. ""You could've put that on one of the trash tv shows Nemuri-Chan watches-""

""I can hear you!"" she called from the kitchen.

I had reached 114 kgs by December end 

Initially, I was doing low-weight resistance training at home. I joined a gym 2 weeks ago and have started structured workouts there.

Earlier, my protein intake was very low (around 30–35g/day). I’ve recently increased it.

However, my weight has been stuck for the past 1 month.

For context, I’ve been consistently doing 10,000 steps daily and following this diet:

Breakfast:

	•	2 besan chillas (no oil)

	•	1 cup milk coffee (minimal sugar)

Lunch:

	•	100g rajma (raw weight) cooked in tomato gravy (no oil)

	•	1 fulka

	•	1 cup dahi

Evening:

	•	35g soy isolate

	•	1 cup milk coffee

Dinner

Tofu marinated with curd like paneer tika and stiffed in fulka like sandwich and grilled no butter with some cheeese 10 grams

I have been able to stick with this diet because all these food I love Lets See to put in a better words. I don’t hate them. So this has made it easy for me to be consistent. I have had cheap days earlier, cheap wheels as well, but that was okay.

Of late I had reached 113 kgs in December, and after that my weight feels mostly stuck also, since a few days, I’m feeling a lot hungrier as well. So the cheat meals have increased.

So currently, I am at a point where I don’t want to give up and go back again, but I am understanding that there must be some changes in order for it to be sustainable. 

The problem is that I don’t like boring stuff such as roasted, Channa Makhana etc 

My target weight is around 92 to 95 kgs.

I don’t have the grinder key so am unable to adjust the grinder, but based on what I’ve read the pucks look fine enough. I eventually gave up and went back to using a moka pot.

Today, I tried using the Saeco and it is not even dispensing coffee from the nozzles. It looks like the espresso (watery) is leaking out from somewhere in the dispenser unit.

I’m so over this machine but if anyone has advice it would be much appreciated.",1,1771256633.0,superautomatic,6,1.0,False

This machine is damn damn; it doesn't forgive any preparation mistakes!

I think I've gathered from the posts that the problem is too much pressure, which leads to too fast extraction.

Then the temperature.

I've thought of three alternative solutions:

TEMPERATURE: Add a resistor in series with the NTC to increase the effective temperature by a few degrees. I used 15 kOhms, increasing it by 4 or 5 degrees.

This way, I have the original control, all 3 levels are increased.



The second way to stabilize the temperature is to cover the tubes that run from the heat exchanger to the brew group. In my opinion, they disperse too much heat and are too long.



TIMES: The third way is to slow down the extraction and do a completely manual extraction and experiment, without lowering the pressure.

Add an external button in parallel with the steam dispensing microswitch.

If you press it, you'll notice that the pump kicks in quickly and the flow is much slower. This way, I have the pressure for a fine grind and a lower flow.

What do you think?



So, even though I use the automatic pressurized setting, I have a problem... Every now and then, when the coffee doesn't come out, there's a popping sound and the head gasket pops off the seat, and water flows everywhere. I have to loosen the shower head screw, the gasket snaps back into place, then tighten it again.

Has this ever happened to you?

How is this possible? Has the gasket become too soft over time? Or has the OPV valve been damaged and is building up too much pressure?",1,1771256625.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1r6czdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1r6czdv/my_mental_hurdle_need_advice/,"My mental hurdle, need advice.","I've been on and off coffee over the years fwiw so this isn't a new thing but this problem is new. 

I cannot mentally justify quitting during detox. I always think there must be a different way , etc. or just plain give up with less thought than that. 

I am convinced I don't want to actually live life without coffee, and shouldn't have to. I definitely simply just want it and don't want to feel without it. 

I really hate this fucking loop people. I am so done with it. 

The TRUTH, is that I just need to set my goal and stick with it no matter what. fine. but there is this serious cascade effect when I quit where my brain is like oh my god this is going to be a nightmare. 

typing this out makes me think that that recognition of that ""doomed"" feeling is actually something that is always there. I try to use coffee to stay ABOVE or ahead of it but the physical aspects of caffeine drive me in to paralysis naturally, and obviously. 

here's my actual question - I am convinced that the other side isn't ""better"", and this must be the best, but this isn't WORKING anymore. so what's on the other side if it works, even if it's not better or worse, must be the right answer. 

so I have to go with what works. this doesn't work. the answer seems very obvious. 

my question is - have you all gone through this? ",2,1771256598.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1r0nlmb/how_insane_would_it_be_to_attempt_croissants_for/) last week asking if it would be insane to try to make croissants for the first time as a Valentine's Day gift for my girlfriend. The general consensus was that it leaned toward insane, but go for it anyway. I went for it. Turned out pretty well! 

  
I used Claire Saffitz's recipe and technique [here](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022053-croissants?unlocked_article_code=1.MVA.QwK7.BTcC4HUTATbW&smid=share-url). I watched that video so many times. We're bffs now! 

  
I made the dough and then I didn't really feel like it was rising like it should. Turned out, my yeast was old, so I had to chuck that batch and start over. Lost three hours there! But after that, it went much better. The directions in the recipe are easy to follow. I didn't run into anything that was super hard, but there were sections of the video where I needed to watch it several times in order to see what hers looked like and compare it to what mine looked like. 

  
The second day was much less stressful! I enjoyed cutting the dough into a square! Watching the croissants proof was also very exciting. I wasn't sure about cooking both trays at once like Claire did, but I had done everything exactly her way up until this point and didn't want to stop now! Worked great! Switched the pans and rotated every ten minutes. Perfecto. 

I had eight croissants. I made two ham and cheese, two chocolate, left two alone, and did Claire's almond croissant recipe [here](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022062-almond-croissants) for the last two. I am surprised at how much I liked the almond ones! Totally recommend those! 

  
Everything was very well received! Girlfriend was surprised and happy! I also gave her a bag of coffee, some jam and some fancy butter. The chocolate one went first and received rave reviews! 

I'm definitely going to do this again, but not for a little while! lol I think I can get better, but for a first go, it was great! Thank you to everyone who encouraged me to just try it! And thanks to everyone who made me think twice! That kept me humble throughout the process!

1r6cxwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1r6cxwf/when_i_am_being_productive_getting_interrupted_is/,"When I am being productive, getting interrupted is so extremely jarring that it can leave me feeling tearful for the rest of the day.  Anyone else?","ETA: I've just seen that [someone else posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1r09ku2/cannot_clean_or_organize_when_other_people_are/) about this 7 days ago!  Lots of great advice in there but I'm still feeling a bit fragile, so would appreciate even a bit of support :-) 

TL;DR: The crux of it is that an interruption kills my momentum and means I have to **start**  again, which is by far the hardest thing. And if I don’t actually finish a task myself, I forget that I did *any* of it, so I feel no satisfaction. Today my partner came into the kitchen to make lunch before I had finished cleaning it. It’s two hours later and I am crying about it again.

To be clear, he’s not at fault in any way, apart from maybe not going into the office enough, which I probably need to communicate more clearly.

I’m posting this here because I feel like anywhere else it would sound like a self-indulgent whine and people would just tell me to grow up…

**The longer story**

I‘ve been off work for a few years now, with my mental health and the menopause, and my partner is wonderfully supportive, but do I feel some obligation to do a big part of the housework, which is fine as long as I can stick in my headphones and have my Netflix on in the background and be able to move around the house freely.

I’m feeling a lot better - HRT and therapy/coaching are working - and want to get back to work at least part time, but have some emotional issues to round that, which I am working on with my therapist. All of this is to say, I really want the house to myself to get the boring shit out of the way and focus on myself.

My partner works hybrid and nominally should be in the office three days a week, but it’s cold out, and nobody’s checking, so he doesn’t even go in two days sometimes.  He has his breakfast later, which disrupts my morning, and then stops for coffee a couple of times. To him it probably looks like he’s interrupting my umpteenth watching Star Trek Voyager but it’s actually killing my hard-earned momentum.

The thing is, he has a dedicated space to work at home, and while I do also have my woman cave - where he won't interrupt me - I obviously can’t be in here to clean the kitchen or sort out the laundry. My room is also not big enough to exercise in, so just now I have not joined him for a walk - which I would have enjoyed - so I could be guaranteed 20 minutes of uninterrupted cardio without having to let him past to get a glass of water.

Writing all this down is making me think I need to explain this to him clearly, but what does that even look like? “Sometimes I love having you at home during the day but at other completely unpredictable times your being here really gets in my way, and I can’t tell when, until I’m actively upset”? I can just about manage to keep the place tidy if I am free to bimble around and do things as they occur to me.  Any sort of a schedule is just going to be a no-go.

Anyway, rant over! I feel calmer, but would love to hear if you identify - I feel this is totally ADHD but then the whole trope of traditional housewives hating it when their husbands retire springs to mind... Also, any advice on how to handle this or communicate to my partner would be good!",9,1771256501.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

1r6cxo9,https://i.redd.it/b20ovymtmvjg1.jpeg,"Someone in my founders group tried to steal my code through a ""code review"" tool. Here's what I learned about trust in this space.","I need to get something off my chest because I think a lot of you have been through something like this and nobody talks about it.

I'm a 9 to 5 guy who builds after hours. Every night after work I sit down and keep pushing on my project. It's slow. It's exhausting. But it's mine and I care about it deeply.

A few weeks ago a guy in our founders group reached out to me. Said he really liked what I was building. Complimented the project. Then offered me a tool he made that connects to your GitHub to do ""code reviews.""

I almost gave him access to my actual repos.

Something felt off though. I can't explain it logically. Just a gut feeling. So instead I connected his tool to a throwaway account with nothing real in it.

I kept being cool with him after that. Encouraged his work. Wished him happy birthday. Invited him into our private founders channel. Treated him the way I try to treat every builder I meet which is with genuine support because this journey is hard enough already.

Then yesterday I'm scrolling LinkedIn and I see a video from this same guy. He's demoing a tool. And it looks almost identical to what I've been building. Not similar in the way that two people solve the same problem differently. Similar in the way that makes your stomach drop.

I sat there staring at my screen for a while.

And I'm not going to pretend that didn't hurt. It did. Because I actually believe in helping other founders. That's not something I perform for content. That's just how I operate.

Now look. I understand how this works. Ideas are not unique. Two people can absolutely arrive at the same solution independently. That happens every single day and it's completely normal.

But that's not what this was. And if you've ever been in this situation you already know the difference. You can feel it.

This experience taught me something I think every founder in here needs to hear especially if you're early and you're excited and you want to share everything with everyone.

Your openness is a strength. But it's also a vulnerability.

I finally understand why so many builders go quiet. Why people stop sharing progress. Why the smartest founders I know are extremely selective about who gets to see what they're working on before it's live.

But here's where I landed after sitting with this for a day.

Am I afraid of someone copying what I build?

No. And I mean that.

Because anyone can copy features. Anyone can copy a landing page. Anyone can screenshot your UI and hand it to a designer. Anyone can take your idea and try to build their own version.

But nobody can copy your taste. The way you think about the problem. The relationships you've built over months and years of showing up honestly. The persistence that keeps you building at 11pm after a full workday. That obsession with getting the details right that nobody else even notices.

They cannot copy you. And that's not a motivational poster. That's the actual competitive advantage.

So here's how this story ends.

He lost access to a group of people who genuinely wanted to see him succeed. People who would have helped him grow. People who would have shared connections and feedback and support freely.

And I got something valuable too. Clarity about who belongs in my circle and who doesn't.

If you're building something right now and you're doing it the right way, with honesty, with integrity, with real effort, protect that energy. Be generous but be smart about it. Trust your gut when something feels off. And don't let one bad experience turn you into someone who stops helping people.

The sun is for everyone. Just be a fair player.

Curious if anyone else has dealt with something like this. How do you handle trust with other founders especially in early stages when your idea is still fragile? Would love to hear your stories.

Also if you're a founder who wants to be around builders who actually support each other we do a casual Coffee and Build session where people show what they're working on and get real feedback from other founders. No pitch decks. No fluff. Just real people building real things. Next one is here if you want to join. [https://luma.com/24nk1s1x](https://luma.com/24nk1s1x)",2,1771256487.0,buildinpublic,1,1.0,False

1r6cxex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcaret/comments/1r6cxex/our_first_visit_to_hotel_xcaret/,Our first visit to Hotel Xcaret,"We just left after a week at the resort with our kids 2 and 5. I know many people have left detailed reviews, many of which helped us immensely, so here is mine (however, too much reading made my head spin and felt like a lot- do not over prepare either! no matter how much you read or plan, you’ll need to be flexible and will find you want to modify)

(For context, we are Canadian, we have travelled relatively often, love and appreciate good food, and though we do appreciate luxury,  we are overall low maintenance people. This was our first all inclusive as well)

Check In/ Arrrival

We booked through Costco, paid for a private transfer. This was worth it for sure, but there was no clearly marked Costco sign per se, but it wasn’t hard to find at all! There was a little kiosk dedicated to the company Costco uses where you ckeck in and we  did wait a few minutes for the car to be ready. Overall, a very smooth process, highly reccomend the private transfer, very comfortable, and avoids having to check on amidst a huge group of fellow shuttle guests.

The actual check in was very smooth- though I will say, timing matters. We checked in at 2:00 pm and it was tame, but in the evenings it is BUSY. For how large the resort is, there are only 4-5 people working the front desk- they are great though so be patient! 

After you check in, as others have mentioned, there is a concierge who sits down to talk about the resort, the details, and of course pitch the dreaded sales breakfast. This was an easy and polite no- don’t let other reviews convince you it’s a big deal at all- just be polite! Now if I may reccomend a divide and conquer approach for this part to my fellow parents;, my husband sat with the concierge and I walked with the kids. This ensured at least one of us actually absorbed the info and prevented trying to get tired and antsy kids to sit still. 

We then ate at the buffet, they took our bags for us, and the room was ready at 3:00 as expected. 

Take your time getting the lay of the land, there is so much to see and soooo many little nooks and crannies- we spent a while the first day getting familiar, stopping wherever looked fun or appealing and just going with the flow. I wish I hadn’t spent so much time reading reviews (lol as I write one) and planning where we should go, because once we were there, it didn’t matter as much/ didn’t always make sense!

There were so many guests who seemed unaware of how to be remotely polite (say please and thank you for the love of God) and many who seemed to feel they were a priority- I heard someone say to their wife at one of the buffets “Do you want any of this \*Mexican Food\*” and their wife with disgust “No way”- .  I thought it went without saying, but patience is key and if you read negative reviews, but you decide to let the more positive once’s sway you, you won’t regret it. 

The Rooms 

We had a garden view room in Casa Tierra. It was lovely! Perfect location,but really, all of the casas seemed great and had something to offer. 

The room was spacious, well stocked with everything from razors to sewing kits! There were snacks and water of course. They also leave reusable/refillable water cups with straps that you can use on resort or at parks (there are water fill stations all over- with purified water).

Rooms were a great temperature, beds were comfortable, no issues there! My kids loved the bath!

It was my birthday during our stay, and they left cake and a note and my husband had requested some decorations in addition to this and they truly went above and beyond! 

Parks

We only did Xcaret, as our kids are so little but it was wonderful! Easy to get to, so much to do. It is a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes and clothing!  Great beach, and decent food. We ate at the beachside buffet. It was ok- a lot of american/westernized food. 

Food 

Before a run down of restaurants, I will say, I had a note on my phone of all of the restaurants, broken down my meal and had the hours and a short description of the restaurant. The app isn’t the most user friendly when you’re walking around looking for a bite during the day, so this was helpful, to have this list. Without any context or lay of the land though, what I thought we would eat when i made h list and where we did eat ended up being pretty different (obviously with the exceptions of reservations).

One other note- we did cancel one reservation the day of- just wasn’t in the cards to get the kids to rally that day and despite what we had previously read, we were not charred for cancelling less than 24hoirs before the reso. 

Mercado

great selection of food, great go to! It does get really really busy and really overwhelming. Breakfast got busy around 8/8:30, and around 6.  Directly across was a smaller buffet, apparently an extension of Mercado with more limited offerings and it was perfect for breakfast- so much quieter but still great food.

La Xentral

Honestly, this was far superior to Mercado. Never as busy, better layout, better food! It was our default restaurant! It’s also, as the name suggests, smack dab in the middle of the resort! 

They also have little to go boxes/meals for those needing food on the go! 

Trajinera

A great breakfast! We didn’t eat lunch (lunch here is seafood only) or dinner here but it was always quieter in the morning than Mercado, with great food (less options than Mercado, but nothing was missing if that makes sense)

Bio

by far the best breakfasts we had! Fresh, so peaceful, great service! It was hard to find at first though so take your time and ask for detailed instructions! Once you’ve been once it’ll be easy to get to

Azul Nogada 

It was really good! The food was delicious, atmosphere fantastic! 

La Silla 

By far the best dinner we had! Loved every bite. I will say though, they told it was family style and shareable but when food came, it wasn’t really shareable (for example, the gordita was just one gordita?). 

Get the fried cheese, whatever you do, get it!

Las Cuevas

Delicious! The most beautiful of the restaurants we went to for sure! There was food for all pallettes, and the house wine was decent too (sparkling, rose and a lovely Syrah).

Chibali

I don’t recommend. Saw people speaking highly for kids- I guess if your kids only eat chicken nuggets and burgers it’s ok. But with all of the amazing other restaurants, this was over hyped and really underwhelming. 

Xinema

A lot fun for kids, wasn’t overly busy (except superbowl- wowee).

Room service

Took about 60 mins each time we ordered it which was no issue for us, but if you’re in a hurry or need it at a certain time, perhaps pre order or order well ahead of time. The actual food was good,  nothing to write home about. 

Xorbete

The ice cream was delicious, the coffee here was probably the best coffee of anywhere we had! 

Other notes:

For all of the restaurants, we asked to sit outside (that was never the default).

Reservations at 6pm were so quiet and great in my opinion- if early eating is your style! 

All of the reservation only places we went were kid friendly, so don’t hesitate if that holds you back at all, especially if they’re young!

There are also snack carts by a few of the pools that are amazing 

Coffee at the restaurants was good, not amazing but it did the trick. 

For the kids

Lunateca

This was a wonderful little reprieve from the sun for our littlest one! It is for kids 0-4 and they do enforce that- which is great, because it means your little ones don’t have to worry about bigger kids knocking them over/ it’s never too busy! There’s a baby change area and a microwave for bottles too, so if you need a little baby pit stop, consider this! 

It is located in Casa luna! once you’re in this casa, signage is pretty clear!

Xiquitinn

This was incredible for our 5 year old! This area is for 5-12 year olds and it is big and bright and has imaginative play areas (pretend hotel) and lots of play options! Another great reprieve for the sun! 

Kids club

We dropped our daughter off here for a few hours upon her request. She came back with a beautiful painted face, mermaid hair and a bracelet she made. It was dimly lit, very calm and a max of 10 kids! It was a great little break from the excitement. Staff were amazing, she had the best time.

They call you when your child is hungry or ready to leave.

The location is well thought out and felt very very safe- not overly visible unless looking for it and when you get there, you can only see or access the front desk. 

Pools

Loved that all of the pools have lifeguards and life jackets!

My kids, as others have mentioned, loved the octopus pool. We usually got there around 9:30 and it wasn’t too busy. It does get busier my midday. There is a concierge there named Vanessa- she goes above and beyond!

The infinity pool was the pool with towels on chairs early in the am to reserve them- we went on a less busy day but, in my opinion, there were many better options with little ones.

Behind Casa Luna, there’s a little wading pool but it has some really fun white water slides! They are always quiet and a great options for smaller kids! We spent  lot of time here, there is a bar and usually a fresh snack station right there and a little fridge that has canned drinks and packages ham sandwiches for a quick snack. Across from this pool is a pool that is between two casas and it is so warm!

We swam in the river too, which I di highly recommend, it was so beautiful and there are water slides that go into the river as well! 

The rooftop pools were busy everytime we checked, but did look beautiful!

Ad Hoc

Get the whatsapp number of a concierge if you can, (if you’re friendly to them, this shouldn’t be an issue) and they are lifesavers to help with everything from renting/Reserving kayaks to making or cancelling dinner reservations to helping with room decorating or special requests!

If you are debating travelling with your stroller or wagon, DO IT! We brought our Veer and it was a life saver! There are strollers on resort but they are small so would have been a really tight squeeze for older toddlers. We didn’t regret bringing our wagon once! 

If you can afford to, tip well, tip often and appropriately! It helps your experience and it is frankly the right thing to do for those helping making your stay special. They work really hard, the staff were always eager to help and really were what made the trip above and beyond!

The Airport

There were mixed messages about gate checking strollers at the cancun airport. We flew out of of MTL and we were able to get check the wagon both in MTL and in Cancun. 

The airport is obscenely expensive for food and the snack and food selection was scarce. Many of us grown ups were stuck eating very expensive gold fish crackers. ",6,1771256471.0,Xcaret,0,0.88,False

So we’re a small firm in Coimbatore, and we’ve just rented a compact additional office space (around 17×10). Right now it’s completely empty… echoing like my motivation on a Monday morning.

Plan is to use this space mainly for backup file storage, client meetings, team discussions and maybe… maybeee some short form content creation if we get brave enough...

What we’re imagining inside:
• Seating for about 6 people with a small conference-style setup
• One clean feature wall (thinking PVC panels + LED/acrylic signage)
• Bookshelves + one big storage unit for files and documents
• Neutral-coloured carpeting since I have serious aversion to shiny flooring also hoping it helps with noise reduction
• A few subtle design touches like frames, minimal art, nothing too loud

Problem is… I have zero design sense.
Like… if left to me, this place will become ""Government office core""

So am here.... calling all the aesthetic souls of Coimbatore

Chapter 1 - Family.

*Smile*. That's the first rule of the circus.

In the morning, the table is usually already set, Nahla insists on waking up earlier than the rest of us. Apparently the French have a habit of eating together, I think it's cute. Which doesn't change the fact that our patience always runs out before the bread. Which isn't very cute.

This circus is made up of a type of people I like to call ""outcasts,"" I laugh just remembering how many grumpy faces I've gotten from Horácio when I referred to them that way.

Horace is an ugly old American that hurts. His hair's been turning gray lately, he's always hunched over like a shrimp. His voice is a mix of a creaking door that's not properly nailed shut and the calmness of a threat. The guy's just skin and bones, that's the truth.

But, despite the jokes, I must admit that Horace is the best fortune teller I, or anyone in this circus, has ever seen. Dragging his rags, which he calls clothes, across the floor, Horácio appears before the audience – when he wants, that is, rarely – without warning, without introductions. He points his finger at the audience, staring intently at the ""victim"" of the day and proclaims their condemnation, or blessing. Usually, when the old man decides to show up, it's not a good sign.

He is our death. And ""death"" sat down sniffling at the table, making Nahla frown and cross her arms.

– Is this serious, Horace? I already asked you to clean your nose before sitting at the table, not *on* the table. – Nahla stated seriously.

– I apologize, Miss Nahla – he buried his face in his sleeve and dragged it against his nostrils, leaving a trail of green snot – but I couldn't care less.

The old man picked up a piece of bread with such conviction, “oh, shit,” I thought. He was going to throw it at Nahla, that would make the girl scream, and Lydia would appear to argue with Horace. And there goes our supposedly “peaceful” breakfast.

– Mediocre French people… – he muttered, before bringing the bread to his crooked teeth and chewing loudly.

Today was going to be one of those days.

– Don't mind him, Nana, the arthritis must be affecting our blind man's mood. – Lydia announced as she sat down at the table with a sly smile, leaning towards Horace. Ironic and elegant.

*Our clown.*

– For your information, it's not ""blind,"" the more appropriate medical term would be—

– Blind! – Her black hair fluttered as she stood up abruptly, slamming her fists on the table, making the silverware tremble. – Now shut your mouth, before I get really stressed out, Ferguson.

Horace wiped his nose again, leaned back, pulling the chair along with him, which emitted a loud creaking sound under the wooden floor. With an ironic smile, he dropped the rest of the bread on the plate and continued:

– Of course, *Miss* Lydia. – He said goodbye.

– Damn old man. – Lydia grumbled and turned to us at the table. – Now that he's had his daily dose of attention, I believe we can have the breakfast that Nana prepared so kindly for us.

– Good morning! – Ramessés announced.

– That's all we needed…

◆◆◆

After a long twenty minutes of endless discussion about who had the best hair between Lydia and Ramessés, we finally heard *his* footsteps.

We all stood up quickly, dropping our cutlery, straightening our posture, hands on our chairs, eyes raised. That was the routine.

*That was the correct way to greet him.*

The white mask covered his face. The red ruffles were sealed with multicolored glitter, long, wide sleeves, and had a blue border with crooked lines that spread across his torso. Showoff. His heavy boots were firm, each step marking the seconds of anticipation of his presence. *Tuh! Tuh! Tuh!*

*He* wasn't physically large, but his energy filled the entire room.

– Good morning, my family.

We exchanged energized glances, nodded, and responded in unison:

– Good morning, *Maestro!*

The Maestro took his place at the head of the table. As we sat down, we returned to our seats. He smiled at us, and of course…

We *smiled* back.

If you can even call that a smile. Lydia always tenses her jaw well before raising the corners of her mouth, keeping her lips pressed together. When it came to smiling, Lydia couldn't be followed as an example. Unlike Ramessés, who adjusted a few strands of his long brown locks that covered his cheek. His green eyes fixed on the Maestro as if observing his every move, with a genuine smile from ear to ear.

Ramessés was a pain in the ass, with his upturned nose and an irritatingly incredible talent as a magician. I bet not knowing what the Maestro's hair looked like frustrated him deeply, being as vain and confident as he is.

And Nahla noticed that confidence. That smile motivated the girl to widen her own, showing her perfectly straight teeth with a contagious positivity. The girl looked at  Maestro seeking compliments, and she got them.

– Your eyes have been exceptionally distinct colors lately, Nahla. – He brought the cup of coffee to his lips, which recoiled, and calmly his gloved hands embraced the sugar bowl. Spoon after spoonful was poured over the hot liquid.

But of course they are different, Nahla has one eye of each color. Her right eye was a turquoise blue, which resembled the sky, if it were possible, I would even say that's why she lives with her head in the clouds. And the other was a coffee-brown color. The same shade as the Maestro's coffee. Too sweet.

Where are the twins? – He asked, while drinking his coffee again, with a satisfied expression, without looking at anyone in particular.

They are on stage with Greta, sir. – Lydia said promptly.

– I called them to join us, – Nahla murmured, looking down, swirling a spoon in her cup. – but Artie and Willow said they had experiments to do, and that they would call Greta to help them.

– What experiments? – The Maestro inquired, turning to Nahla.

– I don't know. But you know how thr twins are. They must be writhing around like they always do.

– Or they asked Greta to do the work for them. – Ramessés commented with a mischievous smile playing at the corner of his mouth, looking at Lydia with half-closed eyes. One hand under his raised chin, amused by the situation.

– In that case, they must already be dead. – I added, copying Rami, resting my chin on the back of my hands, smiling at Nahla.

– Shit. – Lydia stamps her foot, standing up firmly, adjusting her clothes – I'll sort this out, sir – She turns and hurries out the door.

I got up and followed her with a wide smile, laughing softly, excited. I ran through the circus corridors. It was all chaos! I almost tripped twice over the boxes that a certain vagabond magician swore he had organized! I bet it was just another one of his tricks. From afar it must look organized. Idiot. After jumping over ropes, stamping my foot and cursing Ramesses to the fifth generation, I finally reached the red curtain that separated that whole area from the circus stage. Crossing the long, heavy crimson fabric, I looked around trying to get my bearings. The confetti cannon was almost glued to me – great, I was in one of the corners. Phew, thank goodness. I was afraid that, when I went through the curtain, I would end up bumping into the twins contorting their backs. Ouch! My back hurts just thinking about it!

– Good morning, Dmitri!

Huh? Surprised, I turned to the stage and there they were. Greta was turning a large wooden crank, connected to wide tubes, which, when turned, pulled ropes that wrapped around the tubes. These ropes pulled Artie's wrists and ankles.

– Ahh!... that's it, Greta! Hahaha!

Artie oscillated between laughing hysterically and biting his lower lip, arching his eyebrows, almost like an expression of ecstasy. His back arched with each snap of his body, drawing guttural moans from his throat. Having his limbs intensely stretched by Greta seemed to fill him with pleasure.

– Give up, Artie! You're not going to beat my record! – Willow shouted amidst the boy's laughter, which echoed on stage. Standing right in front of the wooden bed he was tied to, Willow chuckled softly, listening to the noises Artie's body made with each turn of the crank. *Crack. Crack. Crack.*

I immediately covered my ears – Ouch! That hurts! That hurts, that hurts! – Bunch of lunatics! No wonder these two have already been admitted to dozens of psychiatric hospitals. All failed, obviously.

– Greta! Stop it now! – Lydia shouted from the other end of the stage, banging her clenched fist against the other cannon. Yeah, apparently the corridor she took was as well-organized as mine.

– Good morning, Miss Lydia! – Greta abruptly dropped the crank, flashing a welcoming smile – Oh, don't worry, haha! This boy can hold on for a few more minutes. – She looked at Artie, who was panting with flushed cheeks and dilated pupils – Can't you, Artie?

Before Artie could answer, Lydia cut him off immediately:

– That's enough of this crap you're doing! Greta, untie this boy now! – She glared at Willow with a stern look. I could swear there was smoke coming out of her head. – And you, girl, explain to me exactly what you were thinking.

– Ugh! How boring! We were just competing to see who could endure the most-

– Greta's medieval torture bed!? 

– That's it! Hahaha! And guess who won?!

Good heavens. Those two could only be psychopaths.

– Stupid masochists. – Lydia muttered before turning to Greta, who had finished untying Artie's handcuffs.

The guy looked like a mess. His platinum blonde hair was all tangled, his cheeks still flushed, clearly visible on his pale, deathly face. His gray eyes had turned a deep black. He looked like a drug addict.

Delirious, Artie grabbed his sister's wrist, also marked by the same handcuffs that had just bound the boy. Smiling, he leaned over her ear and whispered loud enough for me, who was winding the ropes nearby, to hear.

– I only didn't win this time because the clown showed up, you hear me, little sister? It doesn't count as a victory.

– You wouldn't have lasted two more minutes before Greta dislocated your limbs, Artie.

He grinned unsettlingly, moving even closer to Willow.

– And what would be the problem, sis?

I felt my stomach churning. Nahla's bread wanting to go back on the plate. I don't think I want to be here anymore. Giving a platform to weirdos is the Maestro's fetish, not mine.

Willow mirrored her brother's smile, even wider – more bizarre. Slowly, she closed the distance between them, her lips brushing against Artie's ear with each word.

– You're right, brother… I'd love to see you completely break down just to lose to me in the end. Like an idiot, hahaha!

The twin, without blinking, still smiling, replies:

– Good to know we're still on the same page, sis.

◆◆◆

After the twins' incident, Lydia and I explained to the Maestro what happened.

– I'll have a talk with both of you later. You handled the situation very well, with maturity and patience. I'm very proud of you. – The Maestro gently ran his fingers through my hair, slowly caressing it.

I hate when he does that. My skin crawls, my breathing feels strange, and I get sleepy even though I'm not sleepy. How I want him to take his hand out of my hair, but I can't feel my lips anymore, the words won't come out, my body won't move. I can only accept it. Accept this kindness that I never knew if it was genuine or not.

– Just don't forget that we have a show today. – He tilts his head towards me – And you, Dmitri, don't forget to rehearse, okay?

I sigh, feeling the tips of his fingers brush even more.

– Of course, Maestro.

It's not like I have many options at this point. I'm the circus's Interpreter after all. That reminds me that, not many years ago, my position didn't have such a pretty name. I was just another acrobat, just a dirty, bored brat, until the circus came to my town.

Oh, and what an incredible day! I must have been about fourteen years old, skinny as a stick insect, and my hair was still short, I looked even more like a kid.

But the circus changes us all.

I remember sneaking in during the show. I went to the back of the circus and tore the canvas with a kitchen knife. I took a piece big enough to cover myself, and while everyone was distracted watching the show, I went in and leaned against the canvas, covered with the same shade of fabric. And I watched the very end of that performance, with my perfect disguise.

I love remembering Nahla, jumping and doing acrobatic maneuvers in the air, before grabbing the trapeze. And everything got better when Greta entered the stage, which was immediately engulfed in flames. She blew on wooden sticks and these produced enormous fire monsters that roared terrifyingly. At first, I couldn't tell if Greta was even a woman, she was so muscular, I found it quite strange for a while, but then I started to adore her for her strength and fantastic skills. Horacio miraculously decided to perform that very day. I was scared of him after he pointed to the middle of the audience and swore that a random man would be brutally murdered in a bathroom.

But after all the chaos, the Maestro appeared to close the show, just as he had started it.

Even though I can't remember many details, I remember that surreal feeling I had after I left. It was a feeling that anything was possible! I could barely sleep, I needed more. I wanted to know what else they could do, what I could do if I were them. I imagined myself in the circus doing acrobatics like Nahla, spitting fire like Greta, or leaving everyone amazed with magic tricks.

The next morning, with deep dark circles under my eyes and a fire I had never felt before, I went to knock on the circus door, and the Maestro answered:

– Yes, young man? How can I help you?

– I… uh… I admit that yesterday I watched part of the show and… I know I shouldn't have, but I want to, in fact, I need to get into this circus! I couldn't sleep all night! Yesterday's show was incredible, and it made me feel more alive than ever, please, I beg you! Accept me!

The Maestro leaned forward, tilting his head from side to side, as if analyzing me.

– Do you have any talent, kid? – He asked casually.

– I can run very well… like, really well. I can also read and-

– Hired. Don't forget to tell your parents you're moving in, bring few things, our rooms aren't very big. If you have any kind of allergy, physical illness, neurological, psychological, pathological disorder, syndromes, or any kind of limitation, let me know immediately, tell me what you like to eat. Do you have any vices? Any preferences? And if you don't have a routine or fixed habits of physical exercise, well, now you will.

– Welcome… – He continued, looking at me as if asking something. How could he be so calm? As if all of this were the most normal thing in the world. And you know what?

I couldn't be happier.

– Dmitri.

– Welcome to the Circus of Dead Toys, Dmitri. Oh, and don't forget…

*Smile*.

At first I thought it was just a regular table but when I saw it had built in charging ports and a small display I was surprised. That moment made me realize how furniture can now combine style and technology in simple ways.

Later while just casually scrolling through many online marketplaces including alibaba I noticed smart tables in several variations. Some were small side tables with wireless charging. Others were larger coffee tables with LED lights, touch screens or hidden storage compartments. I also saw spare parts and accessories like replacement batteries, USB cables and protective covers available for maintenance. It seemed buyers are not only looking for design but also for usability, durability and ease of repair.

That raises a few questions. Do all smart tables really last long under daily use? Are some designs easier to clean and maintain than others? How useful are built in  tech features for regular activities? And how many variations exist that most people never notice because local stores stock only basic models?

It makes you curious which features actually make a smart table practical, durable and useful. And which small details quietly decide whether it becomes a central piece of the home or just another furniture item ?",1,1771256032.0,GadgetGatherers,0,1.0,False

The high temps are long gone—no more sweating through sheets, no more midnight poultices. The ear cleared up eventually, and I still hold that the remedies pulled him through without wrecking his system.

But he’s not where he should be. Still no real walking. He’ll grab the edge of the coffee table, stand for a few seconds if he’s feeling bold, then plop right back down like standing isn’t interesting enough. No cruising along furniture, no tentative steps. Speech is basically nonexistent—a random vowel here, a grunt when he wants something, but nothing that resembles words or even consistent sounds for “more” or “up.” 

He spends a lot of time sitting on the floor, rocking gently or staring at dust motes in the light, hands flapping a little when he’s excited. When I call his name, half the time he doesn’t turn. The other half he does, but it’s slow, like the sound has to travel a long way to reach him.

His mom isn’t yelling anymore. She’s just… doing. She booked the early intervention screening without running it by me. Two therapists showed up last week with bags of toys and checklists. He didn’t stack blocks, didn’t point at pictures, didn’t imitate their claps or waves. Mostly he spun a wheel on one of their toys for twenty straight minutes. They scribbled notes the whole time. Came back with phrases like “global developmental delay,” “red flags for autism spectrum,” “urgent recommendation for full diagnostic eval, speech therapy, occupational therapy.” They kept saying “the earlier we start, the better the outcomes.”

She’s already got the pediatric neurologist appointment locked in for next month. I tried talking about sticking to the holistic side—finding a functional medicine doc, maybe biomedical testing, stricter diet, home-based therapies like cranial work or sensory integration without the labels. She listened, then said quietly, “He’s not catching up on his own. Every day we wait is a day we can’t get back.” Her voice wasn’t angry. It was tired. Resigned. Like she’s already accepted a version of our life I’m still fighting against.

I catch her sometimes—standing in the doorway watching him rock, eyes wet, then blinking it away and going back to folding laundry or loading the dishwasher. She hasn’t said the word “divorce” or “custody,” but the space between us feels colder every week. She’s building her own plan now, one that includes doctors and IEPs and maybe even medication down the line if they push it. I can feel her slipping away from “us” toward “him first, no matter what.”

I still believe a lot of the natural approach makes sense. I still think the system rushes to diagnose and drug kids who just need time, space, real food, less screen time. But watching him sit there, disconnected, not meeting my eyes, that cold certainty in my chest is cracking. What if the “time” we gave him was the wrong kind? What if months of waiting turned into years of catching up he’ll never fully do?

He’s asleep right now. The monitor shows him curled on his side, breathing slow and even. He looks small and peaceful. I don’t feel peaceful. I feel like I’m standing on the edge of something I can’t see the bottom of and it's all my fault. ",0,1771256014.0,confession,11,0.22,False

Had a client show up in my driveway on a Sunday.,"Just a quick warning for any of the guys here who formed their own LLCs and used their home address for the initial paperwork because it was easy.

Did a standard deck and patio job last month. The homeowner was a nightmare from day one - nitpicking, arguing over materials, avoiding change orders, the usual headache. We finally knocked out the punch list, got the final check, and I thought I was done with the guy.

Sunday morning, I’m in my driveway drinking coffee, and his car pulls up. He wanted to argue about a totally unrelated drainage issue in his yard that he somehow decided was my crew's fault. I asked him how the hell he knew where I lived. He just looked up my business name on the Secretary of State website, saw my residential address listed as the registered agent, and drove straight over.

Absolutely unhinged behavior, especially when you have your family inside the house.

I spent Monday morning scrubbing my personal address off all my public filings. I ended up moving my paperwork over to InCorp just to get a strict commercial address on the state site so there's a hard wall between my business and where I sleep.

Don't make my mistake. If you're a one-man show or run your operation out of your garage, get your residential address off the public record. People are crazy.

By 9 a.m., you're heading out the door for work, knowing the house is in good hands. Your sitter texts a quick photo update: ""We made pancakes and read three books!"" No endless worry. No surprise bills from overpriced agencies. Just peace of mind and real value.  
  
Dear Parent,  
  
If you're like most busy families today, you already know the conventional story: hunt through endless caregiver apps filled with inconsistent profiles, pay premium agency fees for ""experienced"" sitters who charge $30+ an hour and still cancel last-minute, or settle for whoever's available on neighborhood Facebook groups—hoping they show up and actually connect with your kids.  
  
But there is another way.  
  
A smarter, more affordable, more reliable way that's already working for hundreds of families just like yours who want trustworthy college students as nannies, babysitters, after-school helpers, or summer caregivers.  
  
It's called Barefoot Student.  
  
And right now, it's the simplest, most direct path to finding the kind of help that makes family life easier—not more stressful.  
  
Imagine this instead:  
  
You go to [https://www.barefootstudent.com](https://www.barefootstudent.com) and post your job in minutes: ""Part-time nanny needed for two kids (ages 4 and 7) in \[your city\], after-school pickups, homework help, light activities, 3–4 days/week, $20–25/hr depending on experience.""  
  
Within hours or minutes, qualified college students start applying—students from nearby universities who are studying education, psychology, child development, or just love kids. They send detailed resumes, often with references, CPR certification, past babysitting experience, and availability that matches your schedule.  
  
You search resumes directly, message the ones who seem like a great fit, and set up interviews. No middleman. No 20% agency markup. Just direct connection to motivated young people who see this as a meaningful job—not just a paycheck.  
  
Families are already doing this:  
  
\- A mom in Long Beach posted for a part-time nanny for her 7-year-old with autism—and found a patient, experienced college student who became part of the family (see similar postings at https://www.barefootstudent.com/jobs).  
\- Parents in Manhattan Beach hired a live-in nanny/family assistant from the site—someone reliable, local, and excited about the role.  
\- Busy professionals in cities across the country use it for date-night sitters, summer nannies, or after-school care—paying fair rates while getting enthusiastic, background-checked talent eager to build experience.  
  
And the best part? Posting a job is straightforward, and you reach students who are specifically looking for these kinds of flexible, rewarding positions.  
  
Why does it work so well for families?  
  
Because traditional sitter sites are overcrowded with pros charging top dollar or inconsistent part-timers. Barefoot Student is built around college students and recent grads—smart, energetic, affordable, and often with fresh training in child-related fields. They value the work, show up reliably (their reputation matters for future opportunities), and bring a youthful energy that kids love.  
  
Of course, you might be thinking: “College kids? Are they really responsible enough for my children?”  
  
The answer is yes—the right ones. And Barefoot Student helps you find them. . Thousands of families have found wonderful matches: patient, fun, dependable helpers who become like extended family.

Caffeine has a \~5 hour half-life, which means that 2pm cold brew with 200mg still has 100mg active in your system at 7pm, and \~50mg at midnight. Once I started seeing this visually on a decay curve it completely changed when I have my last cup.

Some things I noticed from my own data:

  \- My ""I only drink 2 cups a day"" was actually 350-400mg because cold brew is no joke

  \- Cutting off caffeine at 1pm instead of 3pm improved my sleep onset by roughly 20 minutes (cross-referencing with Apple Watch data)

  \- Weekends I consume way less but somehow feel more tired -- probably just schedule disruption

Before that I tried spreadsheets but gave up after a week.

4. Edward Florentino (50 FV)

Player write-ups from the article:

**1. Konnor Griffin, SS, PIT**

Griffin is a freaky five-tool superstar with big power and enough contact ability to weaponize it. He’s also incredibly fast and has quickly developed into a plus shortstop. He’s about to be one of the best young players in the game.

Griffin is not only clearly the best prospect in baseball, but one of the top handful of prospects ever evaluated during the current era of FanGraphs scouting, which goes back a little over 10 years. He’s a franchise-altering entity whose talent rivals that of Bobby Witt Jr., a young, level-headed [Hanley Ramirez](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/hanley-ramirez/sa3068177/stats/batting), or a faster [Carlos Correa](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/carlos-correa/14162/stats/batting). The rate at which Griffin has become this good is astonishing. His supreme physical gifts were evident in high school, when Griffin was a turbocharged power-and-speed prospect with potential contact issues and an unclear defensive fit. In his first pro season, Griffin put every question to bed, made every aspect of his profile crystal clear, and slashed .333/.415/.527 while climbing three levels to Double-A Altoona, where he had a .960 OPS during about a month of play. 

If you just watched all the players get off the bus, you’d know Griffin was the most talented one. He’s built like Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown, at such a muscular 6-foot-4 that you can see Griffin’s lats bursting through his jersey from space. The added strength has allowed him to shorten up his swing and crush fastballs with greater regularity than he did in high school, including to his pull-side. He posted a roughly average contact rate in 2025, but his hit tool is going to play above that because of the concussive force with which he strikes the baseball. Griffin has become this strong without sacrificing any of his blazing speed, which helped him steal 65 bases in 78 attempts last year. He’ll show you the occasional 4.10 bolt from home to first, churning up a rooster tail of dirt behind him as he bounds down the line, like a human speedboat. 

This sort of strength and speed combination is not normal, and when players do have tools like this, they tend to be outfielders. In Griffin’s case, there was a stretch when it looked like he’d be one. Though he played shortstop on his high school team, he wasn’t polished enough to play there with Team USA or during select high school events, when he was often relegated to right field. The progress he has made on defense is probably the most stunning and impressive aspect of his development thus far, because he is now a plus shortstop defender. At his size and speed, Griffin makes the baseball field look small. No grounder seems out of reach, no throw too difficult to make. Some plays that great big league shortstops need a ton of effort and athleticism to complete, Griffin makes look easy. His footwork around the second base bag can be a little awkward at times, but he’s nimble enough to find a way to get the ball to first even when he’s off balance. Griffin got sporadic reps in center field throughout the 2025 season, too, and he also looks good there, though not nearly as ready for prime time as he does at shortstop. At his size, there’s a possibility that he’ll eventually need to move off short, but that isn’t happening any time soon, and Griffin is going to be really good there in the meantime. This is a complete player, an absolute monster who might make [Paul Skenes](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/paul-skenes/33677/stats/pitching) the second-best guy on his team in short order, who might one day be mentioned in Pittsburgh in the same breath as Mean Joe Greene if they can find a way to get an extension done, and whose daily impact can help return the Pirates to long-awaited glory.



**10. Bubba Chandler, SP, PIT**

Chandler’s command and slider consistency are pretty raw, but his athleticism and background (former multi-sport & two-way player) allow for projection in these areas. He has prototypical size and arm strength, and his changeup has improved a ton as a pro. He’s a potential front end arm.

Chandler was a two-sport, two-way high schooler who could have gone to Clemson for baseball and football. Instead, he signed for $3 million as the first pick in the 2021 third round and was developed as a two-way player for parts of two seasons before focusing on pitching beginning in 2023. Things have gone swimmingly. Chandler’s 2025 was his third consecutive 100-plus inning season and included his first big league cup of coffee, a 31.1-inning stint during which he walked just four and K’d nearly a batter per inning. He sustained a velo spike throughout the entire season, averaging 98 mph while setting a personal best for single-season innings at 131.1 total frames. 

Chandler’s fastball is easily his best pitch. It plays best at the top of the zone and missed bats at a plus-plus rate in 2025. He is far from polished from a command and pitchability standpoint. His incredible arm speed helps him throw the occasional 86-90 mph plus changeup, including some that tail back over the zone to steal a strike, though many of them sail on him. His breaking ball lacks tight, nasty bite (though stuff models seem to love it) and relies on its upper-80s velocity to be effective. The ceiling on both of those pitches will be dictated by Chandler’s ability to develop a more consistent release point and command. To that end, his forecast is very positive; it’s common for pitchers with this kind of arm speed to develop better control later than their soft-tossing peers, and Chandler is the sort of athlete (both in size and mobility) who we should feel comfortable projecting on in this regard. We expect that the arc of his next several years will unfold like [Hunter Greene](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/hunter-greene/22182/stats/pitching)’s career has so far.



**45. Seth Hernandez, SP, PIT**

Hernandez is one of the better high school pitchers of the last decade, a freak athlete who’ll touch 100 with ease before finishing hitters with a great changeup. His breaking ball and control need polish.

A sensational athlete with an ideal pitcher’s frame, Hernandez has monster arm strength and potentially huge secondary stuff. His prototypical size, athleticism, arm strength, and occasional secondary pitch quality put him in the top tier of recent high school pitching prospects, and Hernandez signed with the Pirates for $7.25 million as the sixth overall pick rather than head to Vanderbilt. Though he didn’t pitch in an official game after the draft, he did pitch during instructs, including in the Dominican Republic, where he was his usual 95-100 mph with stunning ease. 

Hernandez is a premium athlete who could have been a good power-hitting, plus defensive first baseman in college. He has a strapping 6-foot-4 QB frame with room for more strength, and it looked like he had already added some by November when he pitched in the D.R. His fastball can be frustratingly vulnerable to contact due to inconsistent location and poor movement characteristics. The former seems like it will be remedied naturally as Hernandez gets better feel for his body’s explosiveness; the latter needs to be ironed out proactively to avoid some of the pitfalls guys like Roki Sasaki have endured despite elite velocity. 

Hernandez’s pronator-style changeup has huge tailing action and plus-plus potential thanks to his incredible arm speed. Hitters can know that pitch is coming and still not make contact with it because of the way it moves. His slider is less consistent and is vulnerable when it isn’t good; it’s mostly 82-85 with two-plane wipe, but the best ones are plus. He has the potential for multiple plus-or-better weapons, with the changeup very likely to be a 70 at maturity, while his fastball effectiveness is going to depend on how its movement develops in pro ball. Hernandez has front end upside but carries with him the risks readers should, by now, know to incorporate into their expectations for his development.



**101. Edward Florentino, LF, PIT**

Florentino is a young power-hitting prospect. Defensively, he’s likely to wind up in a corner.

After mauling both complexes, Florentino kept raking after a promotion to Low-A Bradenton. With the Marauders, he hit .262/.380/.503 while maintaining an 83% contact rate across the two levels. Even more encouragingly, he’s doing a ton of damage on contact and has consistently gotten to pull-side lift throughout his career. He’ll play all of the 2026 season as a 19-year-old and is one of the most projectable power hitters in the low minors. 

Florentino is a tricky one to evaluate, a case where nearly unassailable data runs into a less rosy visual evaluation. His feel for contact and ability to adjust the barrel stands out to the eye as well, but some of the “how” gives us pause. Florentino is an early leaker who tends to do most of his damage on balls in. He doesn’t hit balls on the outer third with much authority, particularly against lefties, who he seems to bail out on even a tick earlier. He’s also a long-levered kid, and while his bat isn’t slow by any means, it also isn’t super quick. Better velocity looms as a real challenge, as do pitchers who can more reliably command the ball away and, to a lesser extent, up. Still, it’s important not to get lost in the negative: The kid was 18 last year and raked against older competition. He projects to get stronger, and we’re a long way from thinking about platoon risk. 

He will have to hit, though. Florentino primarily played center in Bradenton last summer, where he looked like he was in over his head. His reads and actions were very raw, and while he’s still a decent runner underway, he’d be stretched on speed even before we consider that he’s likely to slow down as he physically matures. He should be fine in a corner, however. Hitting is valued at such a premium that it behooves us to stick a big grade on the bat here, though the risks discussed above make him a pretty risky one.",10,1771255339.0,buccos,5,1.0,False

It was the last one for the day. He strikes up a conversation with his mind(M) and heart(H) to decide if he should buy it. 

**M**: This is fairly an easy decision.

**D**: I know, right?

**M**: Yes. Get it or don't. I should not waste my time on this. I have a lot of things to take care at the backdoor.

**H**: But do you really want it? 

**D**: I think I want it.

**H**: You think or you know? 

**D**: I mean...I do like mango pastry. 

**H**: But do you want it now?

**D**: I could get it now. I have the money for it. 

**M**: Then do it. Seems like a very good choice to me.

**H**: You don't have to get it if you don't want to. 

**M(to H)**: Let's just get it. 

**D**: But i just had lunch. I'm full and I can't eat it now. 

**M**: Then save it for dinner.

**H**: But you don't eat dessert after dinner.

**M**: Then save it for lunch tomorrow.

**D**: But it's gonna go bad by then.

**M**: It's fine. You can just throw it away.

**H**: Well that's just waste of money.

*D looks at the pastry like a baby with its light glazing back at him in yellow.*

**D**: Maybe I don't even want it. Maybe I just want to feel like I can have it. 

**H**: So....do you want the pastry or the possibility?

**M**: You guys are becoming inefficient.
 
**H**: We're just getting honest.

**D**: What if I regret not buying it?

**M**: Then you learn.

**H**: What if I regret buying it?

**M**: Then you learn.

**D**: Ughhhh Why does everything have to be a lesson?

*A man walks in with his 7 year old daughter behind him. The cashier looks at them*

**Cashier**: This is the last pastry by the way.

**H(quietly)**: If you want it....Just say something.

**M**: It's not too late to decide.

**H**: .......

*The little girl notices D looking at the pastry. She goes to him*

**Little girl**: Do you want it?

**D**: I don't know.

**Little girl**: Because I want it.

**D**: Oh.  

*The little girl turns to her father and asks him to buy it for her. They get the pastry and walk out.*

*The tray is empty and reflects D's face in it.*

**H**: Did we want it?

**M**: We failed to conclude.

D's coffee arrives. He picks it up and walks out of the cafe, uncertain yet disappointed. D continue to walk on along the street among the loud crowd contemplating what he had done. It's louder inside. He's wondering how did the girl knew so perfectly what she wanted. The little girl didnt know what she wanted too but she acted in the moment and made a decision. Now, that's for her to decide if she likes or not.

He never knew what he wanted. D realised it's always like this. *Is making a decision or a choice always this hard? Was it always like this?*  He thought to himself. 

It was never about the pastry. It has always been like this. His life. It's always like this. Him over complicating and overthinking simple things. He never realised that life is simple. 

Your heart and mind can only give you the way. They can never choose for you. It's always you who has to choose. For good or bad, you often know what you want. You just don't trust yourself enough to admit it.  When you choose without deciding it feels accidental. When you decide and still lose it feels intentional. 

So, the next time there is only one mango pastry left. Either go for it or let it go. But only the next time, I hope it'll be intentional.

Utopia was NOT for me.,"Just got off our 5th cruise and first time on one of the Oasis class girls....a 4 day Carribean on Utopia. Obviously overall it was wonderful to be on vacation and we all had fun but ultimately I don't think it was for me...and I'll likely go back to smaller ships (like Freedom and Mariner!)

First things I liked (because it WAS a cool ship)
- The shows...oh wow the shows. The production show was incredible. The Aqua show was like nothing I've ever seen. The production game shows...especially Name that tune with band and singers was very cool. Best shows I've seen at sea so far!
- The service was incredible...especially in the main dining room. Many of the crew I talked to had done multiple contracts on Utopia and despite the tiring turn over of 3 and 4 day cruises really seemed to love being on board.
- Central park in the morning was such an amazing place to go and sip my coffee while my family slept in. 
- We had an interior balcony rooms and enjoyed the people watching
-Embarkation and debarkation were the smoothest and fastest of any ship I've been on despite the large number of people


Things I didn't love
- Most of this comes down to just being over stimulating. It was too loud, too busy, too crowded. Yes they do a good job spreading people out but it still somehow always felt chaotic and a bit too much. 
- Certain things were EXTREMELY crowded. Enjoying the pool ...even on a port day...was really challenging between the number of people and REALLY REALLY loud music. Trying to get Mexican on deck 16 was always a huge line. There was literally never a seat in windjammer no matter when you went. The coffee line was always very long. 
- The really loud music on the pool deck really permeated central park and boardwalk so all of those spaces felt like you were constantly clubbing. The promenade also typically had loud music so quiet spaces were hard to come by.
- We were fortunate to get advance reservations to most of the big shows. There were standby lines...so you could get in without them but the waits looked pretty long with people showing up 30-45 minutes in advance. We could not get spots for some of our favorites like laser tag, ice skating and the ice show and were turned away when we tried to go in person. 

Ultimately I think a lot of this comes down to being a 4 day on a ""party ship"". I am by no means saying it isnt an incredible ship with a fun atmosphere and tons to do...because it is. That said, this particular sailing just felt too rushed, too loud and overall just ""too much"" for how we like to sail best.",31,1771255207.0,royalcaribbean,35,0.9,False

**Why:**

When you sleep, your body builds up this ""tiredness"" chemical. When you wake up, your body starts clearing it out naturally, and it takes about 60-90 minutes.

If you drink coffee right away, it doesn't actually remove the tiredness. It just covers it up. So all that tiredness is still sitting there, waiting. When the coffee wears off in the afternoon, it all hits you at once.

That's the 3 PM crash. It was never about lunch. It was your morning coffee time.

If you just wait a bit before your first cup, your body clears out the tiredness on its own. Then when you do drink coffee, it actually works properly, clean energy, no crash.

Now Afternoon crash is almost gone. Sleep onset: 40 min → 15 min. Morning energy without coffee: dramatically better by week 3. Total cups per day: dropped from 4 to 2 naturally.

I got obsessed enough with this that I built an app (ARC) that calculates the optimal caffeine windows based on your wake time and chronotype. But honestly, even just setting a phone timer for 90 minutes after you wake up is enough to start.

First two weeks are rough. By week 3, you won't even think about it.

So as you all know my husband Bob is….. an asshole.  

A while ago I decided to put in the same amount of energy as Bob has been - remember how I refused to pick his 💩 stated underwear from the floor and he called me evil and calculating?

Since the New Year I’ve been marking on a calendar the days that Bob complains of feeling sick or injured, or is having a mental health issue, or is being aggressive.   There is not a single day without a mark on it.  Not a day.  It’s always something with freaking Bob.  It’s quite frankly exhausting.

Now to my dilemma - for years I have been reminding Bob to get his prescriptions renewed, I’ve been filling his prescription, I’ve dispensed the medications into two daily does for Bob- organising a month at a time.

Yup.  Bob’s a fully capable grown-ass man, and I’ve been organising his meds like he’s an 80 year old dementia patient. 

Even though Bob uses his medication boxes twice a a day, he expects ME to keep track of his medications and to know when they need to be refilled.  I can’t make this shit up.  

Bob does this irritating thing that when something is empty (meds, coffee, his deodorant, salt etc) he will leave the empty container sitting on the countertop, so that \*I\* will know it needs to be replenished.

Now, a normal person would just TELL me something is out of stock, or even refill it themselves (the horror!).  

For the last two days Bobs medication dispensers have been sitting empty on the counter top.  TWO DAYS.  I’ve been ignoring them.   Bob has not said a word about them, but assume is just expecting me to refill them.

I’m super pissed because Bob could have told me that he was running low and I could have organised more medications earlier. Now I’m in the middle of four night shifts in a row.  OR the currently unemployed Bob could go down and get his own fucking medications.

Bob is now getting super pissed off.  I’ve asked him what wrong once - he said ‘nothing’, so I’m not asking again.

My problem is that two of Bobs medications are mood stabilisers.  Without them Bob becomes a super aggressive asshole.  

Do I just refill the meds and live a peaceful life (ish)?

Do I leave it and let Bob handle it himself?  Even if it means no meds for a week?  Leading to an inevitable blow-up.

At no point has Bob TOLD me that he is out of medicine.  Like, how can I help someone who won’t even help himself??

What do I do, Bromos?  What would you do?

(Side note, incase anyone tells me to leave Bob - before Bob was fired/ made redundant I had been applying for houses to rent - and was rejected for each one.  (Rental crisis issues are a thing here at the moment).  And now Bob has no job, making it super-freaking hard to leave.  I’m stuck at the moment.)",8,1771254943.0,breakingmom,11,0.9,False

If you're down to ride together I'd be interested - I'll buy us coffee! Would also be down to review your routes if you visit D.C. in the future.

1r6c7y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_barefootstudentllc/comments/1r6c7y5/dream_jobs_for_college_students/,Dream Jobs for College Students,"You wake up at 8:30, not because an alarm is screaming at you, but because the sun is already warming the room and the smell of fresh coffee is drifting in from the kitchen you share with two friends who are just as excited about the day as you are.  
  
You stretch, grab your phone—not to check endless notifications from a soul-crushing corporate inbox—but to see what new opportunities popped up overnight. There’s one: a paid remote internship at a fast-growing startup that pays better than your last campus job, gives you real experience in marketing (or coding, or design, or whatever you actually care about), and lets you work the hours that fit your life instead of the other way around.  
  
You apply in under five minutes. No endless forms. No begging. Just your resume—which you already have uploaded—and a quick note. By noon the hiring manager has messaged you back: “Let’s talk tomorrow.”  
  
Meanwhile your roommate is heading out to a freelance project he found last week—$45 an hour, flexible schedule, and it’s building the exact portfolio he needs. The other one is prepping for a campus ambassador gig that pays cash plus free event tickets and merch.  
  
None of you are “rich.” None of you have trust funds or uncles on Wall Street. But you’re living better than most people twice your age—more freedom, more interesting work, more money in your pocket than the old path of sending 200 applications to cubicle jobs that start at 9 a.m. sharp and end when the fluorescent lights finally go out.  
  
Dear Reader,  
  
If you’re in college or just graduated, you already know the conventional story: graduate, send out hundreds of resumes, pray for an entry-level job that pays $18 an hour (if you’re lucky), grind for years before you can afford anything resembling a real life.  
  
But there is another way.  
  
A way that’s been quietly working for tens of thousands of students and recent grads who refuse to play by those tired rules.  
  
It’s called http://BarefootStudent.com.  
  
And right now, it’s the simplest, most direct path to the kind of work—and the kind of life—you actually want.  
  
Imagine this instead:  
  
You log in and see dozens of fresh postings—real paid internships at growing companies, remote freelance gigs in writing, graphic design, social media, video editing, coding, part-time campus jobs that pay $20+ an hour, entry-level roles that don’t require “3–5 years experience,” even opportunities abroad if you’re the adventurous type.  
  
You search by what matters to you: remote only, flexible hours, pays over $20/hr, marketing, tech, creative, nonprofit, whatever. No gatekeepers. No applicant tracking systems that auto-reject you for using the wrong keyword.  
  
Employers come looking for you—because they post jobs specifically hunting for students and recent grads just like you. They know you’re smart, hungry, and far more affordable than some 35-year-old with a mortgage and an attitude.  
  
Last month alone:  
  
\- A junior at Texas State landed a remote social media internship that turned into a full-time offer after graduation.  
\- A recent grad in Florida picked up freelance video editing gigs—while still taking classes part-time.  
\- Students in 195 countries are finding work that fits their schedule, their skills, and their dreams—not the other way around.  
  
And the best part? It costs you nothing to get started.  
  
Zero.  
  
You post your resume in seconds. You set up alerts for the exact kind of jobs you want. You apply when it feels right. No subscription fee. No hidden catches.  
  
Why does it work so well?  
  
Because the old job boards are clogged with corporate postings nobody under 30 actually wants—full-time, on-site, soul-deadening roles with dress codes and mandatory “team-building” retreats.  
  
Barefoot Student is different. It was built for you—from the ground up. Employers who want young talent know to come here. They post real opportunities with real pay. And they move fast.  
  
Of course, you might be thinking: “Sounds too good. What’s the catch?”  
  
There isn’t one.  
  
The only “catch” is that most students still don’t know about it. They keep grinding on LinkedIn (where recruiters ghost them) or Indeed (where algorithms bury their resumes under thousands of others).  
  
But the ones who discover Barefoot Student? They stop applying blindly. They start getting interviews. They start earning real money while building experience that actually matters.  
  
We don’t promise you’ll land your dream job overnight. (Though some do.)  
  
We do promise this: You’ll have access to more relevant, better-paying, more flexible opportunities than anywhere else—opportunities actually built for college students and recent graduates.  
  
To prove it, we’re making it ridiculously easy to try.  
  
Right now, go to http://www.BarefootStudent.com.  
  
Sign up. It’s free.  
  
Upload your resume (or create one in minutes if you don’t have one polished yet).  
  
Set your job alerts.  
  
Browse postings.  
  
Apply to as many as you like.  
  
If after 30 days you haven’t found at least one solid lead worth pursuing—well, you’ve lost nothing but a little time.  
  
But if you do (and most do within the first week or two), you’ll wonder why you ever bothered with the old way.  
  
Thousands already have.  
  
You can too.  
  
Don’t wait for graduation or “the right time.” The right time is now—while companies are hunting for talent just like yours.

See you on the inside.

Most of the time, they arrived too early for the check-in or, on the last day, they wished to leave the accommodation in the morning and enjoy their last hours in town, free of luggage. 

This got his attention. People were not enjoying their time as they should. You put so much effort and planning into your travels just to end up waiting in a local coffee shop for your host to open the door? This can’t be right, it doesn’t feel right.

If only there were a way for guests to enjoy their trip to the fullest without having to drag their bags around, and without hosts and hotels having to make room for all their luggage? And so, LUGGit was born in a garage in Lisbon, founded by 4 people with the vision to redefine the way people travel. 

In the early days, they would spend countless hours talking to tourists who were walking around Lisbon with their luggage. These tourists would be approached on the streets by 2 young strangers who pitched them a service to collect their personal belongings and deliver them again at the airport… Would you do it?

Now, customers can book online themselves, or let hosts and hotels book for them, through our website or app, and choose when and where they want their luggage picked up and delivered. 

A Keeper (our professional driver) will meet them at the scheduled time and location to collect their luggage. They can even track their bags in real-time through the app and reach out to our support team anytime via live chat or WhatsApp. 

We’re creating an end-to-end travel journey where people will travel without ever carrying their luggage.

1r6c6cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1r6c6cb/so_sick_of_this_shit/,So sick of this shit,"Hey everyone,

I just really need to rant for a minute about this shit.

I (28F) have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder since high school, with anxiety attacks dating back to around 12 years old. I've been on medication since my initial diagnosis, and am currently on SSRIs daily and beta blockers as needed.

Normally, my panic attacks last a maximum of 15-20 minutes, and either resolve with medication (beta blockers) or other coping mechanisms (walks outside, talking to someone about it, dissociating on my phone, etc). It's been a while since I've experienced medium-large panic attacks, but recently my life has gotten more complicated and I can feel the influence it's having on my mental health.

I'm currently waiting to hear back on immigration procedures, and have not been able to work since November since my last work permit expired (very complicated story, should be getting a new one in the coming weeks but I hate not knowing). I'm so fucking bored all day, I don't do anything with myself, and I feel like a drain on my partner and my family. Financially I'm ok, but it's just the lack of purpose that's really taking a toll on me. And I have no energy to find a purpose or something to fill my time. I'm just bored and can't pull myself out of it. 

Add to that an especially long and cold winter, and my anxiety has been heightened very much the past few months. Had my biggest panic attack in years a month or so ago, but it went away as per usual. I'm lucky to have a supportive partner who is learning how to help me through, thank god. 

Then comes Friday (like, just a few days ago). I feel my anxiety mounting again, so I decide to do some crafting and listen to a podcast to distract myself out of it. The podcast, however, ends up discussing some triggering topics for me, and it throws me into another state of panic. This time, however, it has last all weekend. I've never experienced this prolonged state of anxiety before. Since Friday afternoon to now, I am in a constant state of dread. I can't even take the time to prepare myself something to eat, as the 'empty' time in my own head while waiting to cook or even make a coffee or tea brings back the compulsive bad thoughts. I've been crying randomly all weekend, even at a friends house yesterday just in the middle of a normal conversation, even been having weird gut problems all weekend that I think must be related. I'm so over this.

Going to the doctor this afternoon, need to ask about a psychologist/psychiatrist as well. But yeah, just needed to lay this all out. I'm exhausted, my partner has to force me to eat, and every second I am dodging stressful thoughts (not a danger to myself or anybody else, jsyk). My body has been through it these past few days and I'm so tired of it.

Thanks for listening.

The board of health said people are afraid of jitters or in other words, overdose. The simple truth is you can't down coffee drinks like you can a soda pop at McDonald's. Each cup of coffee has 75 grams of caffeine.

A better choice is green tea. People are going to say ""I don't want a drink something that tastes like lawn clippings or broccoli"" but that's all just a misnomer. Green tea has a full range of flavors. The one that makes the most sense to Western folk is mint lemon green tea. That you should find at any grocery store. Trendy young people who like Japanese culture will love to know that mint lemon green tea has a name, Kyoto Mint.

Green tea has only 15 grams of caffeine in one cup, so you can drink the whole pot. Part of the mystique of green tea is the attitude adjustment. People on green tea say they want to be productive, and not just mindless consumers.

1r6c3mw,https://i.redd.it/nfbmm68fgvjg1.jpeg,I own both a Gaggimate Pro Gaggia Classic and a Lelit Bianca – here's what surprised me,"I'm currently putting together a video comparing these two machines side by side on my channel ([CoffeeXris on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeXris?subscribe=1)). Before I finish it, I wanted to share some of my notes here and hear what you'd want me to cover. Things I'm maybe not thinking of, aspects you'd find useful, stuff you disagree with.

I've been using a Lelit Bianca V3 for a while now and recently modded a Gaggia Classic with the Gaggimate Pro. I expected the Bianca to win in every category – it costs 3x as much. Turns out it's not that simple.

**The things nobody talks about:**

The Gaggimate actually has an advantage when it comes to temperature changes mid-shot. The small single boiler has less thermal mass, so it reacts faster. The Bianca is more stable overall, sure – but if you want to do something like a declining temperature profile, the Gaggia responds quicker. That one surprised me.

Pressure profiling feels completely different on both machines. The Bianca's needle valve gives you direct, analog control. You feel the resistance, you watch the flow, you adjust in real time. It's almost meditative. The Gaggimate is the opposite: you design a profile on the web interface, hit brew, and the machine executes it. Neither is better, but they attract very different people.

Here's a weird one: the Gaggimate gets software updates. Sounds obvious for a smart device, but think about it. Your espresso machine gets better over time. The Bianca is a finished product. Theoretically it could also get updates via the LLC but so far Lelit did not do that and to upgrade the you probably need to replace the LLC module. Great out of the box, but what you buy is what you get. The Gaggimate community keeps pushing features that didn't exist 6 months ago.

**Where the Bianca still wins clearly:**

Steam power: not even close. If you make milk drinks daily, for multiple people, the dual boiler setup is a different league. The Gaggia can steam well, but it's a compromise.

Build quality and longevity. E61 group, massive brass components, rotary pump – this thing is built to last decades with basic maintenance. The Gaggimate is clever engineering on top of a budget machine. (Not to say the Gaggia will break faster, I am using mine since 5 years with no problems so far).

Accessories. The E61 ecosystem is huge – bottomless portafilters, flow control devices, shower screens, you name it. Gaggia accessories exist but it's a smaller world.

And honestly – the Bianca just looks stunning on the counter. The wood accents, the E61 chrome, the whole presence. That matters to some people and I get it.

**Where the Gaggimate surprises:**

Price obviously: ~600€ total vs ~1800€ for the Bianca. That's a good grinder upgrade worth of difference.

Heat-up time. 10-15 minutes vs 20-25 minutes. If you're the ""I want coffee NOW"" type, that adds up over weeks and months.

Consistency for lazy mornings. Pick a profile, press the button, walk away. The Bianca demands your attention for every shot, at least in terms of stopping the lever manually.

Size. If you're working with a small kitchen, the Gaggia's footprint is significantly smaller.

Power consumption is lower too – single boiler, less thermal mass, quicker on/off cycles.

Maintenance is actually interesting. The E61 group needs regular lubrication, and backflushing is a manual process. The Gaggimate has automated backflush cycles built into the software. Not a dealbreaker on either side, but a nice quality-of-life thing.

**Things that could go either way:**

Noise is different rather than better or worse. The Gaggia's vibration pump has that typical higher-pitched buzz, the Bianca's rotary pump is deeper and more even. In practice the grinder drowns out both anyway.

Resale value favors the Bianca. It holds its price well on the used market. A modded Gaggia is harder to sell because the buyer needs to be comfortable with the mod. But flip side: if the Gaggimate board ever dies, you still have a fully functional Gaggia Classic underneath.

The Bianca can be plumbed in, the Gaggia can't. For some setups that matters a lot.

Upgradeability is a funny one. The Bianca is kind of endgame for most home baristas – you're not itching to replace it. The Gaggimate might leave you wondering ""what's next"" at some point. But then again, its software capabilities actually exceed what many machines at 2-3x the price can do. So where exactly would you upgrade to?

**My honest take:**

If someone asked me ""which makes better espresso?"" – I'd say they're closer than the price gap suggests. Same beans, same grinder, same recipe – the shots are surprisingly similar. The Gaggimate punches way above its weight for straight espresso.

But espresso machines aren't just about the shot in the cup. They're about workflow, ritual, aesthetics, milk drinks, and how much you enjoy the process. The Bianca is for people who want the manual craft experience and make milk drinks regularly. The Gaggimate is for tinkerers who love data and want maximum control per euro spent.

1r6c2pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1r6c2pl/i_was_obsessed_with_changing_my_life_but_my/,"I was obsessed with changing my life, but my routine stayed the same","For the longest time I loved the idea of self improvement more than actually improving.

I would plan everything. New habits, early mornings, strict gym schedule, deep work blocks, no more wasted time. I had notes full of goals. Screenshots of quotes. Podcasts saved for later. I felt productive just thinking about becoming better.

But if you looked at a random Wednesday in my life, it looked exactly the same as it did six months earlier.

Wake up late.

Scroll longer than I planned.

Tell myself I will start after coffee.

Push the hard stuff to tomorrow.

I kept trying to redesign my entire future instead of fixing my daily routine.

And that is when it clicked.

Your life is just your average day repeated over and over.

I did not have a life problem. I had a structure problem.

I was not lazy. I just had too much freedom in my day. When everything is optional, you choose comfort. When there is no clear structure, you drift.

I actually found this app called Reload through a random Reddit ad. Normally I scroll past those, but this one was about a 60 day life reset with a personalised plan. Not just habit tracking, but an actual daily structure laid out for you.

What stood out was that it removes the thinking. It builds the plan around you, gives you daily actions, focus blocks, training, progression, even a ranking system so you can see yourself levelling up instead of guessing if you are improving. There is a built in community too which helps on the days you want to slack.

The biggest shift for me was simple.

I stopped negotiating with myself.

I wake up, open the app, see what is scheduled, and execute it. No dramatic mindset shift. No waiting to feel motivated. Just following a tighter routine.

And slowly my days started looking different.

Once my normal day improved, everything else started moving with it.

Curious if anyone else realised they were obsessed with changing their life, but never actually changed their routine.",1,1771254522.0,Habits,1,0.57,False

He asked everyone ""I need everyone to walk slowly towards the front of the cabin. Really slowly""



The storm was here. Lucky for the tractor, the wind was pushing the rear of the tractor up.



He felt the whip of the tether get loose. He pushed the pedal to the max. The treads started excavating into the ground due to the strength of the machine.



The tractor was struggling, a gust of wind lifted the rear of the tractor. They were out of the hole. Edson screamed ""YEAHHH!!!"".



He didn't stop, he moved several meters more. And asked Natalia ""Be sure we are stopping on hard ice""



The tractor stopped moving, but the engine was still on. For the first time since they fell into the hole, everyone was breathing. The oxygen came back to the cabin.



Everyone was sweating cold and started laughing. They were relieved, after seven days of non-stop moving. 



Edson picked the radio ""Tractor 2. We made it, we are safe.""



No one answered on the radio ""Radio is dead, the storm is blocking the signals.""



Edson stood up ""Everyone, we need to eat, play cards, or sing songs. Everyone is zoning out, and I noticed Xi, you haven't spoken in three days.""



Edson slapped his own face. ""Time to eat""



In tractor 1 Hudson was sitting, looking at the floor, exhausted from crying. Cristian stood up ""Everyone, time to eat.""



Everyone was eating slowly while drinking water. Joaquin spoke. ""Sergei chose to go outside. Without him, we would be dead.""



Hudson spoke ""It didn't have to be this way. Maybe. If I had gone out instead of him. He would still be alive.""



Pascal was silent, looking at the ground. Cristian grabbed his hand ""You did what you could. It's not your fault""



Pascal kept looking at the ground, not processing information. 



Hours passed, the storm cleared. It was still dark outside. The radio was working again. 



""Tractor 2, This is tractor 1. We are safe. Status""



Cristian grabbed the radio ""This is tractor 2, we lost a man. Copy""



A moment of silence passed 



""Who"" the radio asked



""Sergei, he got lost in the storm""



""Copy.""



Everyone in tractor 1 listened. Xi didn't look affected, but, he was biting his lip very hard on that moment. Natalia looked affected, she was trying to not cry. Fang was shocked. Edson face twisted with regret.



Cristian sent the message to base. His radio signal was really bad, they have moved almost 840 km from the 1600 km. Any minute they were going to lost contact with base. 



Diego stood up after listening about Sergei's death. ""I need coffee"".



""Tractor 2. Copy. This is tractor 1""



""Tractor 2 here.""



""Roundabout, we will meet a kilometer from here, to the south. Over.""



""Clear. Over""



The tractors moved slowly, Tractor 1 waited for what felt like hours until Tractor 2 finally appeared.



Xi and Cristian secured the tether again. Xi didn't comment on anything. 



They were connected again. The journey continued.



\*\*\*



They were in the eight day. Edson spoke to everyone ""We are about to lose our signal from base completely. It's going to get quiet the rest of the trip.""



Natalia was falling ill; could have been hypoxia, flu, dehydration, cabin fever.



""Tractor 2, this is tractor 1. Over""



""Tractor 2 here""



""We need to do an emergency stop. Natalia is sick. We need Pascal. Send him over.""



""Clear. Over.""



Tractor 2 stopped within 10 meters of tractor 1. The distance was massive. But the lights and the pause in the winds made the run easy.



Pascal entered tractor 1. The situation was bleak, Fang was trying to attend to Natalia, Xi was non-verbal. Edson was the only one trying to keep everyone spirits up.



Pascal spoke ""Oh god."" He approached the supplies and pulled the medical kit. He grabbed Vitamin-D pills"" He approached Xi. ""Take this pill, and start repeating the alphabet, 20 times.""



Pascal moved towards Natalia, checked her pulse, her respiration, her eyes. He looked into the oxygen levels, they showed normal numbers. Pascal checked the second monitor of oxygen. It wasn't normal, the oxygen was lower than it should be.  



""You people are suffocating. Everyone grab the oxygen tanks. And open the emergency ventilation.""



Edson listened to Pascal. He stood up. ""No need"" He was breathing heavily . He suited up and went outside, climbed onto the tractor. He was heavy breathing. One of the vents was clogged with ice. the one that scrubbed the Co2. He tried to remove all the ice from the vent the best he could. 



Edson stepped down from roof of the tractor. But he collapsed onto the snow. He started crawling onto the tractor. Pascal noticed and ran outside to grab Edson and put him inside. He forced an oxygen mask on Edson. 



Pascal approached the radio.



""Cristian we need to wait for a few hours. Situation is critical here. Uh.... Over""



""Clear. Over""



Tractor 2 backed up by 10 meters, they tensed the tether. To avoid heating the ice and a possible collapse.



Three hours passed. Edson stood up, removed his mask. He was still not fully recovered. ""Radio. This is Tractor 1. We are gonna start moving again.""



""Clear. Over""



They started moving again. Edson was breathing heavily. Pascal approached ""You cannot drive like this, man""



""We need to recover the wasted battery, or the engine might shut down"".



Pascal stepped back, and took care of Natalia again



Xi became lucid. He started realize the gravity of the situation, he grabbed Fang's hand. Fang noticed, they shared a moment in silence.



\*\*\*



It was the tenth day. Xi, Fang and Edson were starting to recover from Hypoxia sickness. Natalia on the other hand, was hallucinating. 



""I think Natalia is suffering from cabin fever with mild cerebral damage due to hypoxia."" Pascal told everyone in the tractor. 



Natalia spoke ""Where is Marcapasos"" in Spanish. 



Xi and Fang did not understand, but Pascal was worried. Pascal grabbed a pillow and said in Spanish ""Here is Marcapasos"" 



She hugged the pillow and went back to sleep.



Natalia was being encouraged to eat and drink water. She was delirious once every few hours. Xi was getting nervous around her. His leg was erratic. His job these last few days is refueling the tractor with help of Fang.



In tractor 1 Joaquin was singing loudly while watching the sensors, avoiding to step on fissures. He was singing song by \*Los prisioneros\* in Spanish. Hudson didn't understand, but he was clapping along.



\*\*\*



It was the twelfth day. Natalia was still sick. Edson declared over the radio and the team ""It's going to take one or two more days"" At this point the GPS was useless, Edson was navigating by looking at the stars. They were getting close.



Xi snapped ""I cannot listen to her anymore"" He pointed at Natalia ""She is gonna get us all sick or killed, I can feel the odor of death coming from her""



The wind started to pick up speed, outside the winds were near 250km/h.



Pascal approached Xi ""Xi, I need you to start counting to 100""



Xi stepped in front of Pascal ""I'm tired of your mind games. She is trying to get us sick, and you know it""



Pascal walked back, he extended his arms to protect Natalia. 



""Oh, so, I'M THE BAD GUY NOW?"" Xi screamed ""YOU WANT TO SEE HOW BAD I CAN GET?!""



The wind outside was really strong, it was hitting the Tractor relentlessly.



Fang jumped between Xi and Pascal, she spoke Chinese ""Dear, calm down, she is just sleeping.""



Xi spoke Chinese ""I'M TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE, DON'T STAND ON MY WAY.""



Xi tried pushed forward. Fang tried to hold Xi back ""Please don't do this""



Xi pushed Fang away. She crashed against the operator seat. She recovered and slapped Xi on the face.



Xi touched his face, he got angry, and slapped Fang with ten times more intensity. He stopped. He realized his mistake. ""Fang...""



Fang was terrified, she started to cry, she grabbed an emergency knife, and pointed it at Xi. She was shivering in terror.



Edson grabbed the radio and screamed ""EMERGENCY STOP""



Edson was about to jump at Fang to remove the knife from her hands. 



Wind. A single strong gust of wind bordering 350 km/h pushed the machine sideways, everyone lost balance. 



Xi fell on Fang.



Xi felt something warm on his stomach, the knife was buried completely inside him. 



Xi stood up and started dripping blood onto the floor, he sat against the wall. Fang was frozen; she didn't reacted, she could only stare.



Pascal approached Xi, He didn't know how to proceed, if he pulled the knife, Xi could die in minutes. If the knife stood inside, Xi could freeze from the inside.



Xi was breathing heavily, He looked at Fang, Pascal, Edson, Natalia. He forced himself up. He was in immense pain. He pulled Fang into a hug. ""I love you, Don't ever change.""



Xi pushed everyone into the cabin, closed the door of the airlock. He opened the door to outside. He wasn't suited up. He pulled out the knife from his stomach. He walked into the whiteout. 



Xi disappeared in seconds. He was gone.



Fang started screaming, and crying, She was screaming in Chinese. But everyone knew what she was saying.



Edson sat back on his station, They couldn't move, they couldn't see anything outside. They were forced to wait and grieve. 



Pascal tried to comfort Fang, Pascal was crying. He gave Fang sleeping pills. 



The wind stopped after a few hours. 



""Tractor 2. This is tractor 1. Over""



""Tractor 2 Here"" 



""We lost Xi. Over""



A long pause happened.



""Clear. Over.""



Inside tractor 2, Hudson was forcing himself to sing, he was crying and singing at the same time. It was the only way to grieve in his position.



\*\*\*



It was day 14th. Edson's face was a disaster. He had bags. Red eyes, he was starting to zone out. Natalia condition didn't help, she had high fever. Fang was non-verbal. 



In Tractor 2 the situation was similar, everyone was extremely tired. Low on weight, dry lips, bags under their eyes.



In this situation, In both tractors, everyone was sleeping together to conserve heat. There was no concept of private space anymore.



\*\*\*



It was 15th day. They were close to something, Edson felt. The wind didn't allow them to see very far.



Suddenly, the wind stopped. There was no wind anymore, Edson kept pushing. The lights of the tractor illuminated a weird object. 



The space ship was there.

1r6c1er,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6c1er,Built a 30-line MCP server that changed my entire design workflow - Claude can now see my UI,"I let Claude generate the UI for my Tabby terminal plugin (TabbySpaces) a while back. You can see it in the screenshots - *AI slop shipped in one go.*

When I decided to redesign it, I knew I wasn't going back to the ""describe red over the phone"" workflow. Tabby runs on Electron/Chromium. CDP is right there. So I built a small MCP server - four tools: `screenshot`, `query`, `execute_js`, `list_targets`. \~30 minutes. Claude now has **eyes** and **hands**.

The workflow that came out of it:

Claude screenshots the current state, generates 10 standalone HTML mockups (not touching production code), I cherry-pick bits from different variants - *""layout from #3, colors from #7""* \- another round with style directions, then Claude implements and immediately screenshots to validate.

The `execute_js` tool is what makes it fast. Instead of implement > restart > navigate > check, Claude injects CSS in the live renderer and screenshots instantly. The whole feedback loop stays in the terminal.

The part that blew my mind - while Claude was doing visual QA, I went to make coffee. Came back to find it had fixed three layout bugs on its own and was waiting for my input on a color choice.

\~30 min MCP build. \~1.5h for 20 mockup variants. \~30 min final implementation. The 'after' screenshot is the result.

Works with any Electron app or CDP-compatible target.

**tldr;** 4-tool MCP server (\~30 min build) gives Claude screenshot + DOM + JS access via CDP. Used it to ship a complete UI redesign - 20 HTML mockup variants, Claude catches its own CSS bugs, and validates visually. Works with any Electron/CDP target.

Picking a topic for a research proposal is often harder than writing the actual paper. You spend three days staring at a blank Google Doc, waiting for a ""revolutionary"" idea, while the deadline is screaming in your face.

In 2026, the academic game has changed. AI is everywhere, the global AI market is hitting $310 billion, and professors are becoming hyper-sensitive to ""generic"" papers. If you want to impress, you need a topic that feels alive.

If you’re overwhelmed, remember that EssayShark has human experts who’ve been in your shoes and can help you breathe again. But first, let’s get your brain moving with these research proposal topics.

# The ""Big Four"" Academic Pillars

Current research priorities in the US and Canada are shifting towards these areas:

* **Technology & AI:** How we trust (or don't trust) machines.
* **Health & Well-being:** 76.4% of us are reporting high stress—why?
* **Environment:** We need $4 trillion in clean energy investment by 2030.
* **Education:** How do we learn when ""robots"" can write our essays?

**Synopsis:**  
Savannah Hart's life implodes the day her perfect younger sister Chloe announces she's marrying Dean Archer—Savannah's college ex who dumped her via text on her birthday and never looked back. Worse? Chloe delivers the news with that smug ""you've always been the problem child"" smile. So Savannah does what any sane, heartbroken, slightly drunk woman would do: she lies. She announces she's also engaged. To Roman Blackwood. Her best friend of five years. The guy who knows her coffee order, her childhood trauma, and exactly how she likes her eggs. The guy she's definitely, absolutely, 100% not attracted to. (Spoiler: she's lying about that too.) Now they're playing pretend for a week in New Hope, and the lines are blurring fast. The ""practice"" kisses. The possessive hand on her lower back. The way Roman looks at her like she's the only person in the room. Savannah's terrified—not of falling for him, but of losing the only real thing she's ever had.

**My Review:**  
Y'all. THIS is how you write fake dating. The tension is insane—these two have shared beds, seen each other naked, and have inside jokes for days, but they're both too chicken to admit the obvious. Roman is the blueprint for ""emotionally unavailable on the surface, secretly obsessed with you"" heroes. He remembers EVERYTHING. She mentions wanting a car once? He buys her a yellow Aston Martin. She needs a fake fiancé? He cancels his Tuscany vacation (with models, his words) to play the part. The family drama hits different too. Savannah is the ""screw-up"" daughter in a family that worships her golden-child sister. Chloe is vile in the best way—she steals Savannah's room, her spotlight, and her ex, then plays the victim when called out. The favoritism is so realistic it hurts. And Roman? This man is unhinged for her in the most delicious way. He'll charm her dad at dinner, then pin her against a wall five minutes later. He destroys evidence of her past to protect her. He literally tells her: ""You're mine, and I never pretended I wasn't yours."" I screamed.

1r6brd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/partyplanning/comments/1r6brd9/decor_for_someone_who_hates_party_decor/,Decor for someone who hates party decor,"Hi everyone,

I’m planning a surprise 40th birthday party for my husband. I love him to death, but one quirk he has (that I do admire if I’m being honest) is that he hates paper/plastic items that are single use or unnecessary. Let me explain how much he cares about this. 

If we go to the grocery store unprompted and unprepared with our reusable bags, he would rather carry the items to the car than get a bag. One time we went thrifting together for a new pair of pants and the thrift store offered him a bag, he declined. I tried to convince him to use one since we were walking to dinner right after but he said no. We went to dinner and he sat with his new pair of jeans next to him in the booth. 

If he goes out for coffee and doesn’t have a reusable mug, he will take the paper cup but refuses to use a lid because he hates the waste. 

Anyway, you probably get the idea now. He is a lovely man and I love his big and generous heart and the fact that he loves the earth. His surprise party is at my mom’s house, lots of space for decorating but I know he would hate balloons, streamers, etc. anything that will end up in the trash or sit in a box never to be used again. Any ideas for more sustainable decorations? This is the first party I’m ever planning. Thanks in advance 🙏",10,1771253813.0,partyplanning,24,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I whipped my head around.

Nothing but the wall and the coat rack.

I looked at Rico. He wasn't watching the movie. He was staring at the window, his face illuminated by a jagged streak of lightning.

""Ant,"" he whispered. ""I swear I just saw a light in the House. Like a candle moving past the upstairs window.""





By 11:30 PM, the storm was a full-blown war zone outside.

The lights began to flicker, the filament in the bulbs whining as the power struggled. Then, the phone rang again.

Rochelle picked it up. ""Hello? Ma?"" Silence. She hung up. It rang again instantly. ""Hello? This isn't funny!"" Silence.

The third time, Rico snatched it. ""Whoever this is, we're calling the—""

He stopped. His face went a sickly shade of grey. He held the receiver out so we could all hear.

At first, it was just static. Then, a wet, bubbling gurgle, like someone trying to breathe through a throat full of blood.

Then, a scream—sharp, distorted, and so loud it sounded like it was being ripped out of the person's lungs—erupted from the earpiece.

Rico slammed the phone back onto the base, his hands shaking.

The basement pipes began to rattle, a frantic clink-clink-clink that sounded like teeth chattering.

""Something's on the roof,"" Tasha gasped.





She was right. Above the sound of the rain, we heard it:

Thump. Drag. Thump. Heavy, deliberate footsteps pacing the length of the house directly above our heads.

Suddenly, the backyard exploded into noise. We heard the chain-link fence rattling violently, the gate being slammed against the post over and over.

Trash cans were being hurled against the siding of the house. We huddled together and moved toward the back window, peering out into the storm.

A flash of lightning lit up the field. There, in the House across the field, we saw it.

A figure was pacing behind the glass of the main window. It stopped mid-stride.

It turned its head—that long, horrific snout—and looked directly at us. It didn't move.

It just stared, a black silhouette against the white flash of the sky.

The lights flickered, and when the next bolt of lightning hit, the window was empty.





BANG! BANG! BANG!



The noise moved to the attic. It sounded like someone was taking a sledgehammer to the rafters.

Tyson grabbed the baseball bat, and he and I crept to the attic pull-down stairs.

We shoved the door open, the beam of the flashlight cutting through the dust.

Empty. Just old boxes and cobwebs.

By 2:00 AM, the house was under siege.

The banging moved to the front door, then the windows, then the walls.

It was unrelenting—a rhythmic, heavy pounding that felt like the house was being Tenderized.

Screams that didn't sound human—high-pitched squeals mixed with a woman's sobbing—poured in from the darkness outside.

We saw shadows passing the windows, tall and distorted, moving faster than any person could.

Exhaustion finally started to win. By 4:00 AM, the adrenaline had burned out, leaving us hollow.

We drifted into a fitful, terrifying sleep, huddled together on the living room floor. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard the snort of the Pig-Lady in the hallway, but when I woke, the hall was empty.





At 7:30 AM, the sun rose, grey and sickly. We were all awake, staring at each other in the dim light, too tired to even speak.

A soft sliding sound came from under the couch.

We all looked down.

Rochelle’s missing Trigonometry textbook slid out from the shadows of the sofa, as if pushed by an invisible hand.

It flipped open to the center page.

Across the diagrams and equations, someone had used a thick, black marker to scribble three words in jagged, frantic handwriting:

I SEE YOU

The scream that left Tasha's throat was the sound of someone who had finally broken.

Sunday morning didn't feel like a day of rest.

It felt like the morning after a funeral where the body hadn't quite stayed in the casket.





The air in the living room was thick, not just with the humidity from the departing storm,

but with the jagged edges of six people who had reached their breaking point.

""Look, the book is weird, okay? I get it,"" Rochelle said, her voice projecting a shaky authority as she stood in the center of the room.

""But we are spiraling. The storm was crazy, that movie was dark, and we’re all exhausted. Our minds are just… filling in the blanks.

We’re going to clean this house, we’re going to act like normal teenagers,

and we’re going to stop letting a pile of wood across the street ruin our weekend.""

""And the message?"" Tasha asked, pointing a trembling finger at the open textbook on the coffee table.

""I SEE YOU. You think the wind wrote that, Ro?""

Kim stepped up, crossing her arms over her chest. ""I bet it was one of the boys. Probably Tyson. He’s been acting extra 'scary' all night.





You wrote it last night to mess with us, didn't you?""

""I didn't touch that damn book, Kim!"" Tyson barked, his eyes bloodshot.

""I spent the night clutching a baseball bat. I wasn't exactly in the mood for arts and crafts.""

""Say I did do it,"" Rico added, stepping in. ""Which I didn't. How do you explain it sliding out from under the couch on its own just now?

You know many books that have legs? You know many books that hide for two days then decide to make an entrance?""

The silence that followed was heavy.

Logic was failing us.

We spent the next hour cleaning in a sort of frantic, desperate silence—scrubbing away the physical mess of the night to try

and scrub away the memory of it.





By 10:00 AM, the house was spotless, but we still felt filthy.

Rochelle finally broke the tension with a forced, playful roll of her eyes.

""Alright, enough. Every single one of you smells like ass and terror. We’re doing a shower rotation. Pick a number 1 through 10.""

We shouted out numbers.

Rochelle grinned. ""One. I’m first. The rest of you, get your bags ready.

Lowest number to highest. No more ghost talk. We’re getting fly, we’re getting fresh, and we’re resetting this vibe.""

The order was set: Rochelle, Tasha, Tyson, Rico, Kim, and finally, me.

As the shower started thundering down the hall, the mood lightened, if only because we were desperate for a diversion.

We started pulling our ""Sunday best"" out of our bags, bragging about who had the best fit.





Rochelle came out first, looking radiant in a flowy, floral sundress, her long hair damp and smelling like coconut.

Tasha followed, emerging a bit later in a high-fashion cropped sweater and pleated skirt, her curls tight and perfect.

When Tyson came out, he was rocking a t-shirt with a vintage Biggie Smalls print and baggy jeans, his fade sharp. Rico joined us next, looking unusually sophisticated in dark slacks and a crisp, white button-up, his ponytail sleekly tied back.

""Look at Rico trying to be a grown-up,"" Kim teased, leaning against the wall.

As Kim was about to enter the bathroom, she turned and gave me that sharp, dangerous smile.

""Ant, you know you want to take a shower with me. Stop playing.""

""Girl, you wish,"" Rico blurted out, making Tasha chuckle.

I leaned back, deciding to call her bluff. ""Alright then, Kim. Let's go. No shame in my game.""

Kim’s eyes widened for a split second before she turned shy, her hand fluttering to my arm.

""You know I’m just teasing… you couldn't handle all this anyway.""





When Kim finished her turn, she looked stunning—a beauty with her long hair cascading over a white tube top and a denim mini-skirt.

Kim did a little spin, headed my way and she gave a playful touch on my arm.

As she touched me, I glanced over her shoulder. Tasha was at the window again.

""I think I saw something,"" she whispered. ""Just now. In the attic window of that house. A face… or a mask.""

""Don't start, Tasha,"" Rico groaned. ""Ant, get in the shower. You’re the last one. Go.""

I headed into the bathroom. The room was like a sauna, thick with the floral and musky scents of five different body washes.

Steam hung in the air like a heavy curtain. I stripped down and stepped into the spray, letting the hot water wash away the grit of the last two days.

Creak.

I froze. The bathroom door had rattled.

""Rico?"" I called out. ""I'm in here, man!""

No answer. I felt a sudden, sharp spike of nerves.

The steam seemed to thicken, swirling around the shower curtain.

Then, without warning, the curtain was ripped back.

I jumped, nearly slipping on the wet porcelain.





Kim stood there, her eyes wide, staring at me with a grin that went from ear to ear.

She was blushing a deep rose color, stumbling back a step.

""Oh my... damn,"" she whispered, her gaze lingering. ""Ant, I… I didn't think you’d actually be…""

But her smile didn't just fade—it evaporated. Her face went bone-white. She wasn't looking at me anymore.

She was looking past me, at the steam-covered mirror behind the sink.

""No... no, that can't be right,"" she stammered.

I stepped out of the shower, grabbing a towel, and looked. Written in the thick fog on the glass,

as if a finger had traced the words while I was behind the curtain, was a single sentence:

YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE

""I didn't do that, Kim,"" I whispered, the hair on my arms standing up. ""I was in the water the whole time.""

""I just walked in!"" she cried. ""I didn't touch the glass!""

She bolted for the door, screaming for the others.





A minute later, all six of us were crammed into the small, humid bathroom.

We stood there—Rochelle in her floral dress, Tasha in her curls, Tyson in his Biggie shirt, Rico in his button-up, Kim in her tube top,

and me, standing there in my nice jeans and pinstriped shirt, damp and trembling.

""Why were you even in here, Kim?"" Tasha asked, her voice tight with suspicion.

""Sightseeing,"" Kim muttered, but the joke lacked any sting.

""Ooh, girl, you nasty,"" Rico and Rochelle said in unison, but their eyes were fixed on the mirror.

""I don't think we should have ever gone into that house,"" Tyson said quietly. His voice was hollow, the bravado of his rapper-tee completely gone.

""I know we shouldn't have,"" Tasha agreed.





It was barely 11:30 AM on Sunday morning.

We were all dressed up, looking our best, ready for a day that would never come.

The message on the mirror was still dripping, the word ""HIDE"" weeping down the glass like a tear.

By 1:00 PM, the ""Sunday reset"" was a total failure.

We were all dressed in our best clothes—crisp shirts, fresh denim, hair laid perfectly—but we looked like people dressed for their own viewings at a funeral home.

The house was too quiet, yet somehow too loud.

Every time the floorboards settled, it sounded like a footstep. Every time the wind brushed the siding, it sounded like a whisper.

""We can't just sit here,"" I said, pacing the living room. ""If we sit here, we’re just waiting for that mirror to write something else.





We need to know what we’re dealing with.""

""Know what?"" Rico asked, leaning against the wall, his shirt looking wrinkled already from his constant fidgeting.

""That the house is haunted? We know that, Ant. We lived it.""

""No,"" Rochelle said, her eyes sharp. ""Ant’s right. Grandma used to say there’s no such thing as a new ghost.

Everything has a beginning. We’re going to the library. We’re looking at the old city records.""

The walk was a nightmare in slow motion.

We passed through the park again, but the air felt like it was thickening, turning into a syrup that was hard to push through.





Every time we passed a parked car, I saw a reflection in the hubcaps—a tall, bent figure walking right in the middle of our group.

But when I looked at Rico or Tyson next to me, there was nothing but empty pavement.

At the gas station, the overhead fluorescent lights hummed with an aggressive, buzzing frequency that made my teeth ache.

The clerk didn't even look up; he just stared at a small black-and-white TV that was showing nothing but static.





By 3:00 PM, we were huddled in the basement of the local library, surrounded by the smell of vanilla and rot—old paper and damp stone.

""Look at this,"" Tasha whispered, her voice cracking.

She had a micro reader pulled up, scrolling through archives from decades ago.

We crowded around the glowing screen.

It was a vague crime report from the late '70s. Location: Faircrest Ave. The report was brief, almost dismissive.

It detailed a missing person call. The responding officers found the house empty.

No signs of a struggle. No blood.

The only thing they noted was that the homeowner’s pigs kept in a makeshift pen in the cellar—were ""unusually well-fed and aggressive.""





The case was closed after a week.

Reason: Homeowner departed of own accord.

""Well-fed,"" Tasha repeated, her curls casting long, jagged shadows across the screen.

""Just like my grandma said. They didn't find a body because there wasn't enough left of her to call a body.""

The shock hit us like a physical weight. Tasha's ghost story wasn't a story at all. It was a police record.

Rico pulled a stack of urban legend books and ""Real Ghost Sightings of the Great Lakes"" off the shelves.

""Maybe there's a way to make it stop,"" he muttered, flipping through pages of rituals and hauntings.

""Maybe we just have to acknowledge it.""

""I don't want to acknowledge it. I want to eat,"" Kim said, her voice brittle.

""I can't think on an empty stomach. Let's just... let's go to the diner. Please. I need to see people. Normal people.""





We checked out the books and began the trek to the local diner.

The feeling of being followed was no longer a suggestion; it was a certainty.

It felt like a cold hand was hovering an inch from the back of my neck. We walked faster,

our conversation turning into a frantic, overlapping mess of plans and fears.

""What are you getting, Ant?"" Tyson asked, trying to break the tension.

""I’m getting the biggest burger they got. If I’m gonna go out, I’m going out full.""

""Burger sounds good,"" I said, my eyes darting to every alleyway we passed. ""But you see that? Behind that fence?""

""Don't look, Ant,"" Rochelle hissed. ""Just keep walking.""





We reached the diner around 5:45 PM. The bell chimed, and the warmth of the grill hit us, but the unease didn't lift.

We sat in a large booth, spreading the library books out among the milkshakes and fries.

Every so often, Tasha would gasp, pointing at a drawing of a ""hush-hider"" or a ""skin-shifter,"" but nothing looked like the snout-faced woman we had seen.

The air in the diner felt tight, like the oxygen was being sucked out of the room.

I looked at the waitress—a young girl who looked exhausted—and for a second, her face blurred, her nose elongating into something wet and pink.

I blinked, and she was just a girl again, holding a check.





We left around 8:00 PM. The sun was gone, replaced by a sky the color of charcoal.

The walk back to Rico's house was the longest of my life.

The streetlights didn't just flicker; they pulsed like a dying heart.

The sounds of the city—the distant sirens, the barking dogs—all seemed to be screaming at once, then falling into a terrifying, sudden silence.

Shadows intensified, stretching across the road until they looked like reaching fingers.

As we turned the corner onto our block, we all stopped.





The House across the field was waiting. It looked darker than the night around it, a hole in reality.

And there, in the highest window—the attic—was a shadow.

It wasn't moving. It was standing perfectly still, its silhouette unmistakable.

It was staring directly at us, watching six kids return to the trap.

""She's waiting,"" Tasha whispered.

And then, the shadow leaned forward, its head tilting at a sickening, unnatural angle, as if it were listening to our hearts beat from across the field.

The front door hadn't even been locked for five seconds when the first crack of thunder split the sky.

It wasn't just a storm; it was a physical weight dropping onto our block.

""Seriously?"" Tyson's voice was a ragged edge of disbelief. ""Again? It’s like the sky is trying to drown us so we can't leave.""





The atmosphere in the house was suffocating.

I leaned against the wall, my head spinning with the police reports and the image of that shadow in the attic window.

On the couch, the girls were huddled together. I saw Kim whisper something to Rochelle and Tasha, her eyes darting to me.

She made a wide gesture with her hands.

Despite the terror, they let out small, hysterical giggles.

Kim looked at me with a hunger, while Tasha looked intrigued and Rochelle just looked shocked.

""Y'all really laughing right now?"" I asked, my voice flat. ""We’re under siege.""

""I think I found it!"" Tyson yelled from the coffee table, slamming a heavy, leather-bound urban legend book down.

""Not sure, but this has to be it,"" Rico added, leaning over his shoulder.

They started talking at once, cutting each other off in a frantic blur of information.

""Shut up! One at a time!"" Rochelle snapped.





Tyson took a breath. ""The book says spirits don't just stay because they’re mean. They stay because of a tether. If they died in terror, or if their 'resting spot' was desecrated. Ant, the city tore those houses down. They bulldozed her life while she was probably still under the floorboards.""

""What if,"" Rico started, but Tasha cut him off, her eyes wide and beaming with a terrifying clarity.

""What if something of hers remains?"" she whispered.

""Something they didn't bulldoze. Something still in that cellar.""

THUD-THUD-THUD.

The basement and the attic erupted at the same time.





It sounded like heavy boots were sprinting across the ceiling while something massive was slamming against the pipes below.

""Damn,"" I whispered, the word feeling small against the noise.

""No,"" Rochelle said, her voice rising. ""You can’t mean we have to—""

""Hell No,"" Kim added, her bravado finally shattering. ""I don’t want to do that.""

""We need to go back into the house,"" Tyson, Tasha, and Rico said in a chilling, accidental unison.

""Are you insane?"" I stepped away from the wall.

""Look what happened just because we touched the porch! We’ve been followed, whispered to, and toyed with all day.

We go into her domain, who knows what that Thing will do to us!""

""If we don't, we’re just waiting to die in here!"" Rico screamed.





Rochelle retreated to the kitchen, her hands over her ears.

Suddenly, the house phone didn't just ring—it flew off the wall, a wet, slurping gurgle began to pour out of the receiver.

Rochelle frantically unplugged it from the wall jack, but the sound didn't stop.

It got louder.

The unplugged phone was screaming a woman’s agony into the kitchen air.

Then, the world went black.

The power didn't just flicker; it died.

I looked out the window.

The entire block was swallowed in a void.

No streetlights.

No porch lights.

Just the rain.





I looked toward the abandoned house. A single, faint candlelight flickered in the parlor window. And then, she was there.

Not a shadow.

Not a reflection.

The Pig-Lady was standing right against the glass of Rico's living room window, inches from my face.

Up close, she was a nightmare of biology.

Her skin was the color of a drowned corpse, stretched tight over a massive, thick neck.

The snout was raw, weeping pink fluid, with jagged yellow tusks piercing through her lower lip.

Her eyes were tiny, black, and filled with an ancient, predatory intelligence.

I scrambled back, falling over the coffee table, my heart almost stopping in my chest.





For the next twenty minutes, the house was a drum.

Banging, rattling, and scratching engulfed us from every direction. It was a swarm of sound, a physical assault on our senses.

Then, as quickly as it started, it fell into a deafening silence.

Rico and Rochelle moved like ghosts, fumbling through the dark until they found three heavy mag-lite flashlights and a box of batteries.

""We have to go,"" Rico whispered.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room.

A massive, towering shadow of the Pig-Lady was projected onto the living room wall, looming over us like a god of the slaughterhouse.

It lingered for three seconds, then faded into the dark.





""I can't... I can't do this,"" Kim sobbed, clutching my pinstriped shirt.

""We don't have a choice,"" I said, my voice shaking as I took one of the flashlights.

""She's not letting us stay, and she's not letting us leave. The only way is through.""

We stood at the front door, six kids clutching each other as the storm raged outside.





We stepped out into the rain, the flashlights cutting weak holes in the darkness, heading toward the house that shouldn't be there.

The field didn't feel like dirt and weeds anymore.

It felt like a vast, black ocean, and the House was a jagged rock waiting to wreck us.

We had only been walking for thirty seconds, but the space between Rico’s porch and that rotting Victorian stretched.

The darkness was a physical thing, swallowing the light from our flashlights as soon as it left the lenses.

""Stay in the light! Just stay in the light!"" Kim hissed, her voice cracking.

She, Tasha, and Rochelle were huddled so close together they were tripping over each other.

I saw the terror in their eyes and handed my flashlight to Kim. Rico followed my lead, handing his to Tasha.

Rochelle already had the heavy mag-lite.

  


The three of them held the beams like shields, creating small, shaking circles of yellow light against the grey, rain-slicked wood of the House.

We reached the porch. The storm was screaming now, soaking our clothes until they felt like lead weights.

""Open it,"" Tyson whispered, his jaw set.

Rochelle reached for the knob.

It wouldn't budge.

We pushed.

We kicked.

The wood felt like solid iron.

From behind the door, the sound started—a wet, rhythmic sliding, like a massive slab of meat being dragged across salt.

It grew louder, punctuated by that congested, bubbling snort.





""It’s trying to keep us out!"" Tasha cried, the beam of her flashlight dancing wildly.

""Or it’s holding the door shut from the other side,"" Rico growled.

""Ant, Tyson—on three!""

The three of us threw our shoulders against the door.

Once.

Twice.

The house groaned, a deep, structural sound that felt like a warning.





On the fifth try, the frame splintered with a sound like a gunshot, and the door burst open.

The air inside was stagnant and smelled of copper and old grease.

Shadows didn't just sit in the corners; they danced, elongating along the peeling wallpaper as the girls' flashlights swept the room.

Disembodied whispers—high, chattering sounds that weren't quite human—drifted from the vents.

""What are we even looking for?"" Kim whispered, her light trembling. ""A heart? A bone? What binds a monster?""

""Anything that doesn't belong,"" I said, though nothing in this nightmare felt like it belonged.

Suddenly, a flash of movement.





The Pig-Lady appeared at the end of the dining room, her hunched back silhouetted by Tasha’s light.

She vanished before the beam could fully find her, leaving only deep, fresh claw marks gouged into the plaster.

She was taunting us, skittering through the walls like a roach.

""Second floor,"" Rochelle commanded. ""We clear it and move up.""

The moment our feet hit the second-floor landing, the House lost its mind.

The floorboards bucked and shook.





A heavy oak nightstand in the master bedroom suddenly took flight, hurling itself across the room and shattering against the wall inches from Rico’s head.

""She’s getting angry!"" Rico yelled over the roar of the house.

At the end of the long, narrow hallway, she appeared again.

This time, she didn't run. She stood tall, her elongated limbs twitching.

She opened her maw a horrific mess of tusks and grey tongue and let out a scream.

It wasn't a vocal sound; it was the sound of a thousand pigs being slaughtered, mixed with a woman’s desperate sob.

""Hide! Into the room!""

I lunged for the nearest doorway.





We huddled in the dark, the six of us breathing in syncopated gasps.

""She’s right there,"" Tasha whimpered. ""She’s right outside the door.""

I waited until the screaming faded into a low, gurgled humming.

I poked my head out.

The hall was empty, but the walls were weeping a dark, oily fluid.

""Coast is clear. Move,"" I whispered.

We finished the second floor, finding nothing but decay.

The only place left was up.

The attic.





We climbed the narrow, winding stairs, the wood screaming under our shoes.

The attic was a whirlwind of chaos.

As soon as we stepped inside, the room began to shake uncontrollably.

Old trunks burst open, shattering against the rafters.

Then, from the dark corner, a black cloud erupted.

A flock of starlings, hundreds of them, shrieked as they flew directly at us, their wings beating against our faces before they smashed through the attic window and into the storm.

""Look at the wall!"" Kim screamed.

A shadow loomed over us.





It wasn't our shadow. It was hers.

Then, a sound came from far below.

Not from the attic.

Not from the second floor.

A deafening, earth-shaking shriek echoed up from the very bowels of the structure.

""The basement,"" Tasha whispered, her eyes wide with a horrific realization.

""Tyson, the report said the pigs were in the cellar. The tether... it’s under our feet.""

The House went pitch black as the girls' flashlights flickered and dimmed, the air turning ice-cold.

We were in the throat of the beast now, and it was starting to swallow.





The descent to the basement was a trip into certain danger. The air grew thick, humid, and smelled so strongly of copper and raw sewage that Kim had to cover her mouth to keep from gagging.

The flashlights were dying, the beams yellowing and flickering as if the house itself were draining the batteries.

""The cellar,"" Tasha whispered, her voice trembling. ""The report... the pigs... it all ends down here."" We reached the bottom of the wooden stairs.

The basement floor wasn't concrete; it was packed dirt, slick with a black, oily moisture.

In the center of the room sat a massive, cast-iron furnace, its rusted pipes reaching upward like the ribcage of a titan.

""Look for it!"" Tyson hissed. ""The tether! Anything that doesn't belong!""

Suddenly, the temperature plummeted. Our breath came out in thick white plumes.





From the darkness behind the furnace, a wet, rhythmic thud-thud-thud emerged.

Rochelle turned her light toward the sound.

The Pig-Lady was there, crouched in a way that no human spine should allow.

She didn't scream this time. She moved with a terrifying, silent fluidity. Before Rico could scream, she was on him.

She didn't bite—she simply reached out an elongated, grey finger and touched his bare forearm. Rico let out a sound I will never forget—a choked, guttural whimper.

Where she touched him, the skin instantly blackened and withered, a permanent, rotted brand.





He collapsed, clutching his arm. ""GET AWAY FROM HIM!"" I yelled.

She snarled, a sound like steam escaping a pipe, and vanished into the shadows. ""The furnace!"" Rochelle shouted, her light hitting the rusted ash door of the old heater.

""Look inside!"" Tyson kicked the iron door open.

We leaned in, our lights converging on the grey ash inside. There, nestled in the soot, was a jagged, yellowed piece of a human jawbone.

It was small—delicate—still holding three blackened teeth. ""That's it,"" I whispered. ""That's her. That's what's left.""





The house screamed then.

Not the walls—the structure.

The dirt floor began to heave. The Pig-Lady materialized at the foot of the stairs, her body stretching and warping until she blocked our only exit.

She let out a roar that vibrated the very marrow in our bones.

""WE HAVE TO BURY IT!"" Tasha screamed. ""THE SOIL OUTSIDE!""

""Ant, take the girls and the bone! GO!"" Tyson yelled, stepping forward. Rico, ashen-faced and clutching his arm, stood beside him.

""We’ll hold her! RUN!"" ""No! We stay together!"" I protested.

""GO, ANTHONY!"" Rico roared, the terror in his voice replaced by a desperate, final bravado.





Tyson and Rico lunged at the entity, their shouts lost in her deafening squeal. In the chaos, I grabbed the jawbone it was ice-cold, but burning my palm and I shoved the girls toward a small, high coal-chute window.

We scrambled through the narrow opening, skin tearing on the rusted metal, and tumbled into the mud and rain of the field.

""Bury it! Deep!"" I shouted.

We fell to our knees in the center of the sour dirt, clawing at the earth with our bare hands. The rain turned the dirt to a thick, black sludge.

Behind us, the House was convulsing. Light—sickly, strobe like flashes erupted from every window.

""Down here!"" Rochelle cried, slamming the jawbone into a hole and mashing the dirt over it. As the last bit of white bone disappeared beneath the mud, a sound like a thunderclap echoed from the House.





The side of the Victorian exploded.

Siding, ancient timber, and shards of glass flew into the night like shrapnel.

The Pig-Lady burst through the wreckage. She stood on the edge of the field, silhouetted by the lightning. She let out a sound that defied nature—a layered, agonizing howl that started as a woman’s cry and ended as a mechanical shriek.

Tyson and Rico burst out of the front door a second later, sprinting for their lives as the House began to fold.

It didn't fall down. It fell in.

The walls bent like wet paper, the roof spinning into the center of the structure.

A massive cloud of grey dust and white fog billowed outward, swallowing the field, the Pig-Lady, and the sky. We huddled together in the mud, shielding our faces.

Slowly, the dust settled.





The rain began to wash away the haze.

We looked up. The House was gone. There was no rubble. No broken glass. No splintered wood.

Not even a footprint in the dirt where the foundation had been. The field was perfectly, terrifyingly flat. Just dirt, weeds, and the memory of a nightmare.

""Is it over?"" Kim whispered, soaked and muddy, her long hair matted to her face.

""She's gone,"" Tasha breathed, staring at the spot where we buried the bone.

Rico sat in the mud, staring at his arm. The black, hoof-shaped brand remained, a dark reminder that some things can't be buried.





Tyson dropped, his Biggie shirt torn to rags. Looking back at Rico’s house, which sat silent and dark across the street. I whispered, ""It’s just a field again.""

""No,"" Rochelle said, her voice hollow. ""It’s a grave. And we’re the only ones who know who’s in it.""

I didn't speak of that house after that day. Not to my mom, not to the police, and eventually, not even to the people who were there with me.

We stayed in Rico’s living room that final Sunday night, huddled together with every light in the house blazing once the power flickered back on.

We didn't sleep.

We didn't even close our eyes. We just sat there, listening to the silence of the field—a silence that felt heavier than the screams had ever been.





Days turned into weeks, and for a while, we were inseparable.

We were bound by the dirt under our fingernails and the copper smell that wouldn't leave our clothes. We would meet up every day after school, sitting on Rico’s porch, staring at the empty lot.

We were waiting for it to come back. We were waiting for the ground to heave again.

But it never did.

Weeks turned into months, and the trauma began to do what time always does: it eroded the edges. The shared looks became too painful.

Every time I looked at Rico, I saw him scratching at that black, hoof-shaped brand on his arm—a mark that never faded, never scarred, just stayed there like a piece of charcoal embedded in his skin.

Every time I saw Tasha, I saw the hollow vacancy in her eyes.

Months turned into years, and the six of us grew apart.





It wasn't an argument or a falling out. It was just an unspoken agreement that to see one another was to remember.

We moved out of the neighborhood. We went to different colleges. We changed our numbers.

I think it’s been something like ten years since the last time any of us spoke.

I heard through the grapevine that Tyson moved down south, trying to find a place where the air didn't smell like Detroit rain.

I heard Rochelle became a teacher, though they say she never keeps mirrors in her classroom. As for Kim and Tasha, they’re just shadows in my memory now.





But no matter how much I wish to forget that damn weekend, no matter how much time has passed, the memory remains fresh, as if it just happened yesterday. I still can't use a microwave without flinching at the beeps. I still can't look at a steamed-up bathroom mirror without my heart stopping.

If you’re ever find yourself in Detroit, and you see a field that looks a little too wide, or a patch of dirt where nothing grows... don't stop.

Posting this kasi masama loob ko.

For context, naka suot ako ng dress na normal lang, sakto lang sa katawan ko, so ung mid section ng katawan ko at shorts ko napapansin pero di super obvious. I'm chubby by the way. 

Sinuot ko ung dress thinking na mag dinner lang kami sa family friend and uuwi din agad but the dinner ended earlier so we decided to go out for a coffee, turns out ung location mejo malayo pero I didn't mind changing outfits. I didnt mind my dress as well kahit mataba ako tignan kasi I was comfortable and its not an issue with me na mataba ako na naka dress kasi I am well aware na mataba nga ako and I usually wear a dress kaya comfy lang ako. 

Nagulat na lang ako nung paalis na kami sa coffee shop, ung kakilala ko sabi niya bakat daw ung damit ko. Then tumawa siya like malakas, ung sister ko pinagsabihan niya. I know it was supposed to be a joke but it was personal for me pero di ko pinatulan, sinakyan ko na lang. Okay lang sana kung sakin niya direkta sinabi kahit pa-joke pero sinabi niya sa kapatid ko. Hindi ito ung first time na na-body shame ako ng kakilala ko so now im sure she did body shame me pala talaga and she's telling other people about it. 

in my inner thoughts, naisip ko na ang petty ng mindset niya, like why can't she let me be? Let me dress how i like and not be noticed and ridiculed by it? She is one of the reasons why plus size girls like me and like her daughter is afraid to dress up and just be themselves. 

This woman is a self proclaimed decent person but i beg to disagree, she is one of the most judgemental person I've ever met. The person who is so afraid to be judged kasi siya as a person is so judgemental that it eats her soul. She is mediocre and she is not perfect pero she had the audacity to judge and make fun of me. 

I don't care about her whole being as long as she is a good person but turns out she is not. 

I don't hate her I just feel sad that she has this fuckin' mindset and its bothering me. 

Thank you to this community, I have the chance to let out my heavy heart.

To all plus size girls out there, keep slaying. I hope you don't encounter people like this. And even if you do encounter people like this always remember na what they do and say is a reflection of their self. ",9,1771253605.0,OffMyChestPH,1,0.8,False

The gentle thrum of the *Among the Star Tides We Sing* was the sound of home to her inhabitants.  She was in fact the second most famous ship to bear that name, and that ship was revered among the nomadic fleets of the Star Sailors as well as all Terrans everywhere, and she was entombed in reverent glory in orbit of Terra herself.  The living *We Sing* was in the spirit of her namesake more than her form, and her name shone even in the shadow cast by such resplendence.  For generations of Humans from the George Family call her home, and that family's name loomed large over recent interstellar history.  Humans were far from her only inhabitants, aside from passengers, the George Family were part of the Star Sailors' Clan Drill, and both the clan and the Georges themselves had long traditions of adoption.  Such was what brought Lisette Frimas's parents together on her decks, though as she understood the story it was a strange adoption.  A strange series of adoptions, even.

The girl herself clawed her way out of bed and shook off the dregs of a thoroughly ridiculous dream involving herself and the lead singer of her favorite band.  Now *those* dreams were too embarrassing to commit to her diary, even the fleeting bits that lingered despite her best efforts.  Her room, or cabin by the parlance she'd grown up with, was in a state disarray, and not merely the kind created by the rebellious spirit of a fifteen year old girl.  Truth to tell, the fact that the cabin's furnishings were all designed with space efficiency in mind had made it difficult to put the stereotypically askew decorations up on her walls, but where she did manage it they were jauntily out of square with everything installed.  The factor behind the majority of the mess was the other trait stereotypical to Terran teens, laziness.  Not to say that she was lazy generally, since she'd learned as a little girl that a ship cannot tolerate lazy crew, and she was crew.  At least, she was crew until she followed her older brother into the Republican Void Navy.

One morning hygiene routine and set of clean-ish clothes later, and Lisette was drawn to the small kitchen included in her family quarters by the heavenly scent of coffee.  She suppressed the usual pang of longing that she felt at remembering her older brother wasn't there to tease about his inability to drink the stuff, and did her best zombie impression as she shuffled toward the black gold.  It drew a squeal of laughter from the high chair clamped to the kitchen table, much like every morning, which was why she did it.  “Coffee...” she moaned as she reached for the pot and the ceramic mug she'd gotten from the Post Exchange at her brother's Basic Training graduation, and her baby brother laughed all the harder.

“Good morning, Sunshine,” her mother, Rose, said with annoying cheer.  Sometimes Lisette couldn't believe her ill fortune, her own mother, a morning person.  Disgusting.

“There's no sunshine in space,” she grumbled as she poured a generous amount of cream into her coffee.

“You want some coffee with that cream?” her father, Vincent asked as if it would suddenly be funny after the millionth time.

She dropped some English muffins into the toaster and glared at him as he sipped his disgustingly black coffee with a raised eyebrow.  Then, at long last she said, “Call day.”

Vincent grinned, and once again Lisette was struck by how there was a tinge of sadness in it.  She'd finally screwed up the courage to ask her father the *whole* story about how they'd wound up on the *We Sing* when she was fourteen, and that certainly explained why there was a quiet undercurrent of grief in everything her father did.  Sometimes though, she wished that her father had told her she wasn't ready.  The rest of the time, she felt a quiet pride in the trust of her father.  “Do we know who's coming yet?” he asked, his drooping canine ears set on her attentively.

“Well there's us,” Rose said brightly as she shoved some kind of allegedly healthy mush toward the marginally cooperative toddler, “Unless Little Jason doesn't go down for his nap on time.”

“It's a war Mom,” Lisette said as she fought not to roll her eyes in exasperation.  She knew her mom was just trying to spin up her brain for her, but that didn't make it less annoying.

“Indeed,” Vincent rumbled.  Lisette's dad's voice was nearly as hypnotically comforting as the ever-present hum of the *We Sing.*  “But a war is a lot of hurry up and wait punctuated by pants-wetting terror.  We should have some maybes the morning-of, since we run Navy Standard Time too.”

“Well, there's Vai, her ship's in transit.  Det hasn't missed a call unless he's under action. Tran says that the *Mister Smee's* in transit too, and unless the enemy has suddenly started using grav spikes again, they'll be there,” Lisette explained before she sipped at her own elixir.  Heaven.

“That's not until,” Rose began as she furrowed her brow and said proudly “Seventeen-hundred hours.  We have time to hear from the rest yes or no.""

“Mom, just say five o'clock.  We're not in the Navy or the War Fleets.”

“I like knowing what time all of the serving kids are talking about,” Rose answered primly, her blunt claws balancing a cup of steaming, properly sweetened, coffee before her.

“That's beside the point,"" Vincent said sternly.

“Side!  Side!”  Little Jason chanted from his suspended seat.

“Free study, and then I pulled entertainment stall duty on the passenger deck,” Lisette said as the toaster popped up her English muffin behind her.

""Games or food?

“Food,"" Lisette admitted, “and nobody wants me cooking.  For some reason they don't want me where adults might be drinking booze or what counts as booze for their race either.”

“I think maybe how you embarrassed that Aborix lady has something to do with it,"" Vincent said flatly as she spread butter and jam on her toasted treat.

“Hey, I'm not the one who tried to strangle a fellow passenger over some boy whore.”

“*Lisette!  Language!*” her mother scolded, and Lisette managed to keep her tail from tucking.

“What?  He is one.   Going around on his girlfriend like that, anyway, I couldn't just let her strangle him.”

""I think it might have more to do with what you had to say about the... *boy whore* and the other woman,"" Vincent observed as his daughter kissed him on the cheek before she sat down across the round table from her baby brother.

“Don't encourage her,” Rose said offhandedly, ""besides you know who everybody will blame if Little Jason starts calling people that.""

“Hey, I only teach other people's toddlers swears on purpose,” Lisette objected as she crunched into her buttery breakfast.  Did it count as breakfast when her mom would have eggs and bacon on the stove in a few minutes?  Lisette pondered the notion as she chewed, but found no answers to such a profound question.

“Free study means you have plenty of time to practice vector and parabolic equations,” Vincent noted, and Lisette groaned before she could stop herself.

“Unless you don't want to get into the piloting program after all,” Rose said while she pointedly focused on feeding Little Jason, “Lord knows they could always use another set of hands in the SAR Corps.”

Lisette set her jaw with grim determination, or maybe less charitably, obstinate stubbornness, and said, “I didn't change my mind.  I got a right to complain.”

“Girls,” Vincent sighed, “can we please skip to the part where you realize neither of you changed your minds?”

“Yes, Daddy,” Lisette said as she tried and failed to keep the sullen note from her voice.

“Of course,” her mother agreed as she quickly shifted gears, “Eggs and bacon?”

“Do we have any more of those sausage patties?” Vincent asked hopefully while Lisette shot him a grateful look behind her mother's back.

Senior Chief Petty Officer Vai Stormborn Daughter of Sam Daughter of Eve had strong feelings about making people eat powdered eggs, even when the realities of wartime logistics put them on the menu.  January the Nineteenth was one of the three out of seven days a week that the enlisted mess aboard the *Trenton* served eggs over-easy to over-well, rather than eggs reconstituted out of a box.  Most galley masters only elected to attempt that feat once a week, and simply aimed for somewhere between over-medium and over-well at that.  However, she knew from personal experience how motivating a combination of high expectations and trust could be, and had no trouble turning that potent combination on her subordinates. 

Her morning watch staff was mainly comprised of RNI troopers assigned KP to keep them busy, but it took very little effort to whip troopers into shape.  Sometimes she still found herself how easy it was, just suggest in the hearing of any RNI trooper that a Navy rating had done his job better, and suddenly being the best line cook within a hundred light years is a worthy goal.  That explained the enormous, by Human standards, wall of muscle manning the griddle made to be tended by three or four men at once, himself.  Although he shuffled from one end of the griddle to the other in time with the ancient song he was whistling, veins pulsed on the back of his ebony, bald head from sheer concentration, and a glance told her that he needed no input.

At another griddle, three men worked together more or less as the engineer team had intended to cook shredded beef and sweet-potato hash in batches, and they also had no need of her direction.  In point of fact, from the griddle work, to the prep counters Navy ratings and RNI troopers quietly competed for her approval, and after only one pointed example, they knew that approval was contingent on them all working together.  Even if her two problem voidsmen did it with glaring scowls for their RNI counterparts.  Both Voidsman Freya Olsen and Voidsman Apprentice Marcus Okoye shot jealous glares at the troopers filling out the duty roster, but they kept it at that.  She nodded to herself, plopped her hover stool down to gain a little height, and cleared her throat.

“Good work, everybody,” she called, “We're on track to start breakfast at Oh-six-hundred.”

Then, she sought out Chief Petty Officer Kenji Sato.  It didn't take her long, for he greeted her with “Good morning to you too.  You want to know if any orders from the officer's mess have come in.”

“Good guess,” Chief Vai answered, “Have they?”

“They heard that the enlisted were getting eggs and hash, and all they've wanted is that so far,"" Chief Sato said with a small grin, “I think some of our fancy-pants have forgotten how the galley actually works and they think you're cooking their breakfast yourself.”

“Okay, Duck,” Chief Vai giggled, “Who's waiting on their plates?”

“The captain, Commander Wash, Lieutenant Commander Herrera, and Lieutenant Hei.”

“Billy!” Chief Vai called to the mountainous Human across the galley, “I need a double easy, a triple the same, a double medium, and triple rocks!”

“Aye Chief Chef!” he called back before he slipped back into *I've Got Spurs that Jingle* and his spatula rang as he cleared space for the officers' eggs while Chief Vai placed four white plates down on the plating counter and carefully spooned out hash, put two slices of triangular toast at the edge of each plate, a pat of butter in the center of each, and garnished each plate with an orange slice.  By the time she was done PFC William Hayes was transferring the cooked eggs from a transfer plate to top the served hash.  “Officers can't stomach nuthin' if it ain't prettied up for them,"" he drawled with a toothy grin in his cheerfully dark face.

“Oh shush, Billy, the voidsmen get nervous if their officers stop being fancy.”

The massive man roared with laughter as he turned back to his task without another word, and Chief Vai loaded the four plates onto a cart that was, regrettably, made for somebody taller to push it.  Pulling it didn't look very dignified, but it was certainly more dignified than crashing it into the captain's table.

“Tia!” Captain Carlos Angelo called from a table when he saw Chief Vai dragging the cart behind her into the officers' mess.  It was marginally nicer than the enlisted mess.  It lacked the row of enlisted-men spooning portions onto stainless trays and sturdy tables and benches, and was instead furnished with round tables and chairs.  The battered state of said round tables was hidden beneath white table cloths, and the same could be said about the narrow refreshment bar along the aft wall, but otherwise, it was furnished like other rooms aboard the *Trenton.*  “You did not need to bring it out to us yourself!”

“I swear, some of you forgot what galley duty is actually like,” Chief Vai scolded as she drew the cart along to the occupied table, and Lieutenant Brandon Hei leapt to his feet to begin passing the dishes to their proper places, “I'll have you know I have that galley running well enough to take my eyes off of it several times a day.”

Captain Angelo batted his hand back and fourth as if to scatter the very idea of the arguement as he said, “Well since you're here, you may as well have your own breakfast.”

Chief Vai had more than half a mind to refuse, but she caught the scent wafting from the steaming mug at the fifth, empty seat already furnished with a booster.  “Peppermint tea?” she asked.

“Aye,” the captain said soberly, “two sugars and a vanilla creamer.”

“Churros still aren't on the menu,"" Chief Vai scolded as she clambered up into the offered seat, “and I don't think I'll be staying for a whole meal.""

“We needed to talk to you,” Lieutenant Commander Eli Herrera said gravely, “We'll be adding steak to the menu soon.”

Chief Vai froze with her hands clasped over the offered stimulant tea.  Her heart thundered in her ears, the memory of another ship, another galley, and a dreaded three word order.  It wouldn't come to that again.  She'd put steak on the menu since.  She'd been under action without it coming to that since.  If it did, she would do her duty again.  “Patrol route unchanged?” she asked, and she was again shocked at how steady her voice was.

“Tightened time-table,” Captain Angelo admitted. 

“O'Brien will still have time to send her procurement shuttles?” Chief Vai asked as she sipped a little steaming heaven.

“Aye,” Lieutenant Commander Herrera confirmed as he broke the yolks of his eggs.

“Tia,” Captain Angelo said gently, “I think maybe the next week or so we will need to get ready for a long fight.  I can't talk about the details yet, the regs, but basically we have to cut off an enemy supply line.”

“We getting reinforcements?”

“Just the squadron and our escorts.” Captain Angelo answered.  “I don't think it's so bad we have to make waffles and ice cream  to go with the steak, but it's going to be a long two weeks once we're under action.”

“I can order the staff to keep quiet,” Chief Vai said while a fierce pride burned away her worry, “but I have smart crew under me.  They'll figure out we're taking a deep breath, and not all of them will think they need to hide that from their own shipmates.”

“Did you forget I'm their captain?” Captain Angelo asked, “Of course they're fabulous, otherwise I wouldn't have them.  Sexy and handsome too, only not as handsome and sexy as I am.”

Chief Vai couldn't help herself, she burst out laughing.  Even while she was in the grips of her own levity, her commanding officers found an extra plate and meted out a portion for her from their plates before she could notice or object.  Once her mirth had subsided Vai said, “You know, I actually quite like the enlisted mess.  Besides, nobody's slapped any pips on my collar while I wasn't looking.”

“Wouldn't be the first galley master to wind up a ship's skipper,” Lieutenant Commander Herrera noted, and Chief Vai cringed inside.

“Bah!"" Captain Angelo scoffed, “If we promote Tia, then who will cook so much excellent food?  She will steal all of the cooks for her own ship and we shall have to get by on good looks and MREs.”

“You  planning on finding good looks, Los?"" Chief Vai asked to a very satisfying round of chuckling around the table.  “Anyway, today's the usual call day, and I have some coordinating to do.”

“That reminds me, I need to call my sister.  Even if she will complain about how I have too many girlfriends the whole time.”

“Ex girlfriends don't count,” Commander Richard Wash mused, speaking up at last.

Now *that* sent hot coffee spewing from Captain Angelo's mouth and nostrils in a coughing fit, and very luckily for her, Chief Vai managed to avoid a repetition of the skipper's display.

Rose and Lisette crept through the bulkhead hatch leading to their quarters with a muttered prayer of “Please God, don't let it wake him,” from them both.  The hatch slid to with a hiss, and they pressed their canine ears against the door and heard... nothing but the omnipresent thrum of the *Among the Star Tides We Sing.*

“You gonna wake him up when it's time to cook dinner?” Lisette asked her mother.

“I think today's a fine day to get dinner in the crew dining room.” she answered with a relieved sigh as mother and daughter stood and brushed themselves of imaginary dust.  That is, until Lisette caught herself and abruptly tried to look coolly unflappable instead.

“Pizza night,” Lisette agreed, and her mother rolled her eyes at her.

“Well, I suppose we can use Big Jason's quarters for the call.” 

“Sounds like a plan, man,” Lisette nearly sang as she began to strut toward the single men's section of the heavyworlder quarters deck with a spring in her step.  “Hurry up, Mom!"" she called back when she noticed that Rose was not matching her stride.

“Hold your horses,” Rose sighed back, “I'm texting your father to let him know the change of plans”

“Neigh!"" Lisette shot over her shoulder and displayed nary a sign of holding horses of any kind.

Rose shook her head ruefully, but didn't bother hiding her smile.  There wasn't any point.  Lisette didn't more than glance back as they strode the corridors until they finally made it to Jason George's  quarters aboard the *We Sing.*  She thrummed warmly beneath their feet.  They didn't need to say anything as they opened the hatch to Lisette's cousin's quarters.  They were spartan in comparison to the Frimas's family quarters, and Lisette wondered once more why her older cousin had bothered moving out of his own family's suit.  Her older brother seemed to have more sense in that regard than Big Jason, in her estimation.  If she squinted, the front room was cozy with a kitchenette crammed into a corner with a counter with space for a pair of bare barstools sectioning it off from the sitting area.  A built-in sofa dominated the center, and a wall-to-wall holodesk filled the end opposing the kitchenette.  Anybody with sense enough to keep from spacing themselves wouldn't prefer such an “economical” space to the comfortable spaces of *real* quarters, so thought Lisette in any case.

Lisette wasted no time in bringing Big Jason's holodesk to life, logging into her shipboard account, and initiating the call in the family communication server.  She didn't even have time to turn on the holodesk's camera before its speakers started chiming to signal people joining the call.  Icons flashed to camera views, but Lisette was already grinning at her brother's blue plumage.  “Hey, Det.  Glad you could step away from thrilling heroics long enough to talk to your little sister a little.”

Outside, to other people, he was The Blue Blur, or Lieutenant Senior Grade Cadet Frimas, but to Lisette, he was forever and always Det.  Cadet's throaty avian clicking chuckling came over the speakers and it was almost as good as him being home, “Hey Squirt.""

“You got more fanmail, and this week it's bigger than Jason's,” she proudly told her big brother as she leaned against the holodesk and flicked her eyes over the four other windows hovering opaquely against the wall.  “Where's everybody else?”

“Zack's on a drop,” Vai sighed, and Lisette noted that Jason and Trandrai were calling from the same desk, and compared to the quarters on the *Mister Smee,* these were downright luxurious.  Come to think of it, all of the deployed family members' quarters were rather bare. 

“I heard from Billy that he'd probably be running a void op all day this morning,” Big Jason said, “He said it was a nasty crash.  Freighter smashed into a micro-hab.”  Lisette grimaced and crossed herself at the thought of those poor people's plight, but Big Jason asked, “Where are the Terrors?”

“Grounded,” Rose and Vai said flatly together.

“Again?”  Trandrai and Big Jason asked at once.

“Aye,” Vai sighed, “Mom was still too mad to tell me exactly *why* a couple of minutes ago, but I bet something exploded.”

“Not this time,” Rose said, “This time it was noxious gas.”

“Okay, but where are Uncle Vincent and Mom?” Big Jason asked, clearly reluctant to dig into the twins while they couldn't speak in their own defense.  Big Jason was decent like that.

“Dad's on his way,” Lisette answered, “and Aunt Bridget is in the middle of an emergency surgery.  I'm still light on details, but apparently some passengers conspired to get their hands on Pure Terra chocolate, and they were very not able to eat it.  I think that some of the Friendlies still think that chocolate is the secret behind Terran strength.”  Every last distant member of the call groaned in a most satisfying way at her explanation, and Lisette decided it was a pretty decent time to go fishing.  “So, what's new?”  Admittedly, she wasn't the most subtle conversationalist. 

“Not so fast,” Major General Maxwell George said, with his steely blue eyes flashing like lightning below his graying auburn hair like a kindled storm cloud, and his rumbling voice distant thunder to match, “Where's Little Jason?”

Lisette winced as her mother opened her mouth to explain, but as she did, the bulkhead hatch leading to the main corridor hissed closed and Vincent's gravely rumble answered, “Asleep.  We had a nice morning, but he turned grouchy as the day went on.”

“Poor little tyke,” Big Jason sighed wistfully. 

“Poor him?  Poor us,” Lisette scoffed as she waved her hand as if to dismiss her baby brother from the conversation, “he'll pitch a massive fit tomorrow when he realizes he missed the call.”

“Little Jason misses me just as much as you do,” Cadet scolded mildly, but Lisette could hear a talon tapping the deck irritably.

Under a circle of eyes holding the dread threat of disappointment behind their critical glances, Lisette buckled.  “I know that, and yes poor him too.  You don't have to deal with the fit though, we do.”

“Now,” the grizzled general mused, “how are my parents doing?”

“Nanna and Pappa both say that you should hurry up and win the war so you can retire and take over the *We Sing* already,” Lisette dutifully reported, and everybody under the age of thirty fell comfortably into a wave of laughter that everybody over the age of thirty bore with stoic grace.

“You tell them I'll retire when I'm good and ready, war or no war,” the subject of his junior's good-natured mockery retorted once their mirth had subsided.

“Aye, Uncle Maxie,” Lisette agreed quickly, “now no more stalling.  Spill!  What's new?""

The noise fell away as if it had been cut loose with a knife.  Eyes shifted within the frames of video feeds, expressions were carefully blanked, and Lisette understood.  At length, Vai decided she could share, “I've been asked to prepare to put steak on the menu.”  Lisette was pretty sure she didn't show anything on her face, but nobody on the other ends of the call could see her grip her skirt under the desk in tight fists.

That seemed to break the dam, and Cadet said, “All pilots have been ordered to take on an extra sleep cycle.”

Trandrai shared a look with Big Jason before she said, “We're drilling procedure for a company drop.”

Big Jason finished with a rueful sigh and said, “I think that *somebody* who may or may not be in this call is about to shove a second set of bars on my shoulders.”

“Advancement is out of my hands, Son,” the general answered, “but I have made my recommendations.  I think I can say a little more here than the kids did.  We're going to see if we can't evict the enemy once they're dug-in without glassing the world.  You'll learn the details once it's done.  Now, fair's fair, Little Missy, what's new with you?""

Lisette looked away and answered, “Oh, nothing much.  Working, studying, the usual.”

“Well, Squirt?  What kind of studying?”

Lisette very pointedly didn't look at her brother's camera feed as she muttered, “Math...”

“You know,” Big Jason said teasingly, “you don't need to know nearly so much math to pilot power armor.  You move, it moves.  It's very intuitive.”

“Blowing stuff up requires some math,” Trandrai added in that same teasing tone, “but the math itself is pretty straightforward.”

“Guys,” Cadet sighed and the sharp *tak-tak-tak* of his talon tapping on the deck came over his mic, “stop trying to steal my future wingman to be another dirtpounder.”

Lisette half wanted to melt into a humiliated puddle on the deck, but her father laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder.  She did melt, a little of her embarrassed tension melted away at any rate, so she said, “I clawed up to a seventy-three average on the practice exams today.  I'm getting better.”

“The explosions are a lot more interesting close up,"" Trandrai said, as if she was dangling a tremendous temptation, and Lisette felt a grin blooming across her face.

“Thanks, guys.  The other thing is, you know January's almost over... and uh... after that it's... I was thinking maybe I would want a party for, um, you know... my sixteenth,” Lisette said trying, and failing to move the conversation to something a little less embarrassing.

“I'll put in a request for leave,” Cadet answered at once.

“Same,” Big Jason and Trandrai said together, but Big Jason continued, “We've been out for two months, and they usually like to get us some R&R on sixty day cycles.”

“If we can't make it on the day, we'll drop in,” Trandrai explained, once again noting where Big Jason had somehow missed his own point.

“The *Mister Smee* is due for repair and refit, could be a longer leave period than usual,” her uncle Maxwell interjected, “and I'm almost certain I can be there.”

“I'll do my best,” Vai said quietly.

“The work is never over,” Big Jason agreed, “Speaking of, looks like one of the privates did something stupid again.  Keep your heads up and your boots down folks, I'll see you when I see you.”

“Same,” Trandrai said, and their camera feed winked out. 

“Keep the fire going everybody,” Vai said, “bed's calling me.”  Her feed winked out too, and Lisette wished that she had a cool thing to say to sign off too.

“Squirt,” Cadet said, and waited for Lisette to nod before he said, “steady on.  I know you can do it.  Mom, Dad, I love you.”  He, however didn't log off just yet.  

“Keep your boots down and your heads up,” the general echoed before he added, “and all of us out here are proud of the home you keep for us.”

“Love you too, Max,” Vincent rumbled before he said to Cadet, “Come home.”  With that, the remaining windows winked out.

Chief Vai tossed the tablet to her quarters' narrow desk where it clattered and thudded merrily,  though it mismatched her mood.  Her bed did call to her, but there were things to do.  They could wait for her to hop down from her too-big chair to twist and turn her back and tail until satisfying pops rolled from the center of her back to the tip of her tail and the base of her skull.  “Why does sitting down after a long day on my feet make me feel so crunched,” she muttered to herself as she stretched the other way. 

“He'll come home, Daddy,"" Lisette said as she laid her own hand over her father's where it gripped her shoulder gently, “he's a hero, after all.”

“Yeah,” the old man grunted as he helped his daughter to her feet, “he is that.”

Lisette couldn't understand the brief flash of pain and worry on Rose's face as she looked at Vincent, and she wasn't exactly sure that she'd seen it there before the usual, confident, cheerful expression was across it again, if a bit colored by her own desire for dinner and bed.  To that end, she said, “Let's go get something to eat.”

“Pizza night,” Lisette agreed enthusiastically.

Her mother rolled her eyes as she opened the bulkhead hatch for their family party and scoffed, “You know that the crew dining room serves things other than pizza?”

“Well, aye, sure.  But I want pizza, and it's on the menu,” Lisette cheerily declared.

Chief Vai reluctantly clambered back into her seat and took up the tablet again.  Vincent or Rose would probably catch up Brigid on the call, that is if Maxwell didn't.  It was an even chance if Maxwell could call his wife before the couple actually aboard the *We Sing* met with her.  Either way, it took her off the list.  The other absent cousins needed their updates.  Whether it was in the RVN, RNI or even the SAR Corps, duty comes first, and the universe never particularly cared to schedule emergencies around when anybody had an important call to make.  She started tapping out a message to Lance Corporal Zachery George with the opening line, “Wait until you're condition green,” so that he would know that reading the wall of text could wait.  Once she'd finished summarizing the news, she ended it with “How'd the drop turn out?” so that he'd know they remembered he was under action and cared. 

“How come Det doesn't have to deal with privates getting stuff stuck up their noses if he's a lieutenant like Jason?” Lisette mused through a mouthful of chewy bread, melted mozzarella and generous pepperoni. 

“The Navy doesn't have privates,” her father answered flatly, “and he's a squadron commander.  His subordinates are all senior NCOs or junior officers.”

“Don't talk with your mouth full,” Rose sighed as she leaned over to tap Lisette's skull with her soup spoon with a cluck. 

Lisette decided to follow her mother's spooned-out advice and actually swallowed her food before she said a little more seriously, “They're going to try to clear them out of one of the Axxaakk Reformation planets.”

It was a curious fact that Terran made tablets make keystroke sounds by default.  Chief Vai had always taken that for granted before her first adventure as a child.  That event had been more than anybody had bargained for, yet she was glad to have passed through it.  Still, since then she was always aware of how much nicer the sound made typing on tablets, like she was now as she tapped out a message to Specialist Medtech William George.  This one she stated with simply, “Call summary:” since he blocked all messages while in the middle of a void rescue op anyway.  When lives hung in the balance and depended on focus, any SAR Corps medtech wouldn't flinch at appearing rude by leaving a message on received for days on end.  After summarizing again, she this time ended with, “I pray everybody made it out of that crash.”

The Frimas Family, or at least as much of it had dined together, fell quiet outside the bulkhead hatch leading to their quarters lest they wake one of the members who didn't dine with them.  A tension hung in the silence, and the soft whirring of the opening hatch sounded like a howling gale to the trio as they held their breath.  From within, silence.  All three exhaled in relief.  They hadn't disturbed Little Jason.  One bedtime battle per day was plenty for the Frimas Family, and none of them wanted a repeat of earlier in the  day at this late hour.  So, they quietly crept through the living room toward their cabins.  Where Lisette parted from her parents, they shared a quick, quiet hug and kiss goodnight, and the teenage girl ever so softly closed her cabin door behind herself.   It was then she realized that it had been a long day.

Lastly, Chief Vai typed up an update to post in the “Family Updates"" channel of the family's communication server for the benefit of the aunts, uncles, cousins, and clan members that cared, but weren't so close as to feel they should be included in the weekly call.  The George family could be shockingly shy, in Chief Vai's estimation, especially when one realized how ready they were to forge friendships with whoever they met.  The thought once again brought a short bark of laughter out of her as she hit send, and then she answered the call of bed.

Lisette tucked herself in, and the *Among the Star Tides We Sing* thrummed comfortingly beneath her.

Just Vai curled up around herself in her too-big berth, and the *Trenton* rumbled angrily below.

That's what I wanted to scream at Claude three messages into a color-mismatch argument. You know the feeling - three paragraphs describing what you want, Claude understands maybe half, and then 15 messages of the world's worst telephone game.

I was redesigning the UI for my Electron plugin (TabbySpaces - a workspace editor for Tabby terminal). The old UI was what I call _""one-shot AI slop""_ - generated quickly, shipped fast, and it looked exactly like that. So I asked myself: _why am I describing visuals to something that can't see?_

## What I built (in 30 minutes)

An MCP server that connects Claude to my app through Chrome DevTools Protocol. Tabby runs on Electron/Chromium, so CDP was the obvious bridge. Four tools: `screenshot`, `query`, `execute_js`, `list_targets`. Claude now has **eyes** (screenshot) and **hands** (query + execute_js).

The part that blew my mind - Claude validates its own changes before I even look at them.

## The workflow

Instead of jumping into code, Claude screenshots the current state, then generates standalone HTML mockup variants. I cherry-pick: _""Take the layout from #3, the colors from #7.""_ Another round with style directions like ""Tight & Sharp"" vs ""Soft & Modern"". Once I'm happy, Claude writes the real code and immediately takes screenshots to validate.

Here's an actual prompt from the process:

```
Generate 10 HTML mockup variants for the workspace list redesign.
Use a horizontal tab bar instead of vertical cards. Each variant
should be a standalone HTML file I can preview in a browser.
Vary the spacing, typography weight, and section organization.
Reference the current UI via screenshot for context.
```

Key insight: because mockups are standalone HTML, I could explore 20 wild ideas without any risk. If they all sucked, delete and try again.

And then the magic moment - Claude catches its own CSS bugs. Writes code, screenshots the result, sees something's off, fixes it. _No more ""hey, the padding looks wrong"" from me._ **Opaaa!** It works.

MCP build: ~30 min. Mockups + design: ~1.5h. Final implementation: ~30 min. The visual validation took ~2h, but here's the kicker - **Claude was doing the looking, not me.** I literally went to make coffee and came back to validated code.

**tldr;** Built a 4-tool MCP server that gives Claude eyes (screenshot) and hands (DOM + JS) via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Used it to ship a full UI redesign - 20 HTML mockup variants, Claude picks up its own CSS bugs, and validates visually before I even check. The hard part wasn't technical; it was realizing this was even possible.

What about you do a bit of research before saying nonsense online? Do you also need ChatGPT for that?

Let's take into account 3 things: energy, CO2 emission, and water. And we're not even talking of training the god damn AI until the water consumption one

\* Energy: Making a single image consumes somewhere around the consumption of charging a full phone battery (on average). Source\[Source\](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084189/making-an-image-with-generative-ai-uses-as-much-energy-as-charging-your-phone/)

\* CO2 emission: Once again, a single image you make will emit the same amount of CO2 as driving 4.1 miles in an average gasoline-powered car. Source\[Source\](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084189/making-an-image-with-generative-ai-uses-as-much-energy-as-charging-your-phone/)

\\-Water: Let's begin with the training itself. Training a large language model like GPT-3 can consume millions of litres of fresh water\[Source\](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271). Keep in mind that GPT-3 is outdated, and the AI keeps growing. As of 2023 (obviously, the consumption keeps growing) AI consumes 1.8 – 12 litres of water for each kWh of energy. To explain this, I want you to know that charging your phone consumes anywhere between 0.001 kWh and 0.03 kWh. If we take the phone charging average (0.02) and remember that  charging your phone takes as much energy as generating an image, and a little above the average of water consumption (6.5 litres), we get that generating a single image consumes around 0.13 litres. And that's if you take the first prompt, because most of the time you will ask the AI to generate another one. Source\[Source\](https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/how-much-water-does-ai-consume)

And anyways, drinking a cup of coffee is drinking, not generaitng an image you don't really need to.

\>Yes there was lmao, conversation over

You didn't even care to consider making some shitty poster in Canva. Even if there was a need, there are many possibilities other than AI. He actually didn't \*have\* to make it with AI, but he \*wanted\* to make it with AI. I'm not discussing what's right or wrong, but I'm stating a fact.

1r6blt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/realhorrorstories/comments/1r6blt3/searching_what_is_ultimate_perfection_of_human/,searching what is ultimate perfection of human life ? do not for here is it,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This article argues that **food is one of the simplest, most scalable ways** to make employees feel seen—whether you’re running a small shop with mixed shifts or a multi-location operation.

Instead of “one big appreciation day,” it focuses on **repeatable food gestures** that boost morale and culture over time—plus how to do it in a way that feels inclusive and genuine.

# What you’ll learn (without spoiling the whole list)

* **Why food works** as recognition: it turns “thanks” into something employees can actually experience, and it naturally creates moments of connection across teams and shifts.
* How to pick food ideas that are **easy to scale** for different business sizes (small, medium, enterprise) *without* creating a scheduling headache.
* A mix of options—from quick wins like **coffee + treats**, to more memorable moments like **build-your-own meals, catered spreads, or food trucks** (the article breaks down a full list of 15).
* The most important “make it land” tips:
   * **Ask employees what they want** (quick survey beats guessing)
   * **Accommodate dietary needs** (veg/vegan/gluten-free/dairy-free + halal/kosher where relevant)
   * **Label everything** so no one has to awkwardly ask
   * Make it **consistent** (monthly traditions > one-off gestures)

It also touches on how tools can help you keep appreciation organized—tracking preferences, collecting feedback, and making recognition more consistent—especially if you’re managing a larger or distributed team.

1r6bek1,https://tipstor.com/wellness-challenge-meditation/,Wellness Challenge: Meditation,"The most powerful travel tool rarely appears in packing lists, yet it weighs nothing and transforms every mile. Ten minutes of daily meditation. In airports, on mountain trails, in swaying train cars, or on quiet balconies overlooking unfamiliar streets, the ritual becomes a mental compass that steadies travelers while the world rushes past in brilliant, unpredictable motion. The practice is simple, guided breathing through an app or quiet mindfulness without technology, yet the results ripple outward, sharpening focus, easing stress, and creating a calm resilience that turns unexpected travel moments into opportunities rather than obstacles.

The ideal season to begin the meditation challenge is any season that involves movement, though it becomes especially powerful during high-adventure travel months when schedules tighten and environments change quickly. Imagine starting the day with ten minutes of stillness before hiking alpine ridges, surfing coastal waves, trekking rainforest trails, or cycling across vineyard valleys. The calm focus built through meditation heightens awareness, making each experience feel richer. The distant call of seabirds during a cliffside hike, the rustle of deer moving through forest brush, dolphins surfacing beside a kayak, or colorful parrots streaking across tropical skies. Wildlife encounters become sharper and more memorable because the mind is fully present rather than distracted by travel fatigue.

Food and drink experiences also deepen under this slower mental rhythm. Street food markets transform into sensory theaters where aromas, textures, and flavors register more vividly. A steaming bowl of noodles in a night market, freshly grilled seafood on a beach, mountain tea brewed over a small fire, or locally roasted coffee served in a village café all feel more layered and satisfying when approached with a centered mindset. Travelers often discover that meditation naturally encourages mindful eating, savoring meals instead of rushing through them between activities.

Saving money while practicing the meditation challenge becomes surprisingly easy. The habit promotes appreciation for simple experiences, sunrise viewpoints, public beaches, free hiking trails, local festivals, and neighborhood markets, reducing the urge to chase expensive attractions. Ten quiet minutes in a scenic park or at a scenic overlook often delivers more restoration than costly entertainment. Free or low-cost meditation apps provide guidance without subscription fees, and the practice requires no equipment beyond a quiet seat and willingness to pause.

Over time, meditation becomes a travel companion that strengthens endurance for long flights, patience during delays, and openness when navigating unfamiliar cultures. The traveler who meditates daily tends to notice small details others overlook. The rhythm of local street life, the patterns of migrating birds overhead, the changing color of evening light across distant mountains. Adventure remains intense, rafting rivers, climbing cliffs, diving reefs, but the mind moves with clarity instead of chaos.

The meditation challenge transforms travel into a more expansive experience, where physical exploration pairs with mental steadiness. Ten minutes each day becomes a quiet anchor in a constantly shifting world, helping travelers move through landscapes, cuisines, wildlife encounters, and cultural discoveries with a sense of balance that turns every journey into something deeper than distance covered.

Looking for a connection with someone who is interested in finding a partner to build a life with.  

I value kindness, empathy, and honesty. A good sense of humor  (I have a pretty silly one myself, so hopefully we can make each other laugh!). 
 
In my free time, you can usually find me with a book, watching a new crime show or enjoying a lazy walk in the park, maybe one that ends at a coffee shop? I am also happy to go with the flow, whether that's trying a new hobby you love or just relaxing at home.
