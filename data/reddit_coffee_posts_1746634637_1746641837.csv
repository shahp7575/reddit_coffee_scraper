Ain't it good bein' all alone?‚Äù

At around 1 in the morning while calling my girlfriend, I realized that how much my job was paying me when I checked the bank statements. A $180 paycheck. Now, that‚Äôs fucking slavery‚Ä¶. It is with the work they have me doing.

I reacted the same way to this paycheck to when Rick Grimes reacted to Lori dying on The Walking Dead. I was completely devastated. I already knew this shit wasn‚Äôt gonna work out. I knew I couldn‚Äôt work in that bitch any longer. $18 an hour for the work I‚Äôm doing and the quality of work I‚Äôm doing? That‚Äôs fucking insulting. I‚Äôm not going to put myself anymore through that so fuck a two weeks notice. 

$18 an hour is so bad that I actually thought about waking my father up that late, so that I can console to him how I‚Äôm getting fucked over.

I couldn‚Äôt go to sleep for awhile after hearing those news. I really screwed myself over by not asking more questions about how the pay works. Yeah. With the work that they are asking me to do? I‚Äôm good. Not worth it at all.

My fathers partner went off to work, which left me to look after my father. We talked for a bit, and he agreed that I need to get the hell out of there. ‚ÄúNo Mames‚Äù, was his response to me telling him how much I‚Äôm paid and with how I was treated there. Even had me call my uncle who pretty much said the same thing as my dad. Shit, he even mentioned that he would see more to it about finding other places for me to work at. That‚Äôs nice, but I‚Äôve been telling him for awhile now to see if he could find me work elsewhere.

So I proceeded to send a message to my about-to-be former manager, ‚ÄúEffective immediately, I will no longer be working at *****.‚Äù Immediately blocked her after that for good measure.

It was nice though knowing that I‚Äôd have time off, I was meant to be working a 5 hour shift later today, and a big dinner the next night. It would‚Äôve been nice to have worked those and received good money. But I‚Äôm not getting good money. Im getting fuck-all, so yesterday was my last day. It‚Äôs not worth working for a place like that. How the fuck are you booked two years in advance and can‚Äôt pay gratuity? Cheap as hell.

Like this is so bad that I don‚Äôt even care if they don‚Äôt even bother to send me my next paycheck. It won‚Äôt even be $100‚Ä¶.

I then got my father out of bed so we can his day started. I then got his breakfast ready and heated up his coffee. He loves to have coffee in the morning, and if it‚Äôs not hot enough, he sends that shit back. We then proceeded to talk about how much he would get paid for work, or if he‚Äôs had any similar situations like I‚Äôve had today. He even had me call my uncle because he thought my uncles reaction would be hilarious.

My uncle actually thought I was fucking with him when I called him. Had a nice conversation with my dad and I about it. Pretty much told me to get the hell out of there, which I had already done. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what else to write here, especially since this entry is about the 2nd of May, it‚Äôs now the 7th‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm like 85% sure this is the 50th entry of this ‚Äúera‚Äù of my journaling.  

I used to journal quite a lot to cope with my life. 

Coping will always be needed. But I haven‚Äôt needed to journal as much anymore.

A while ago, My girlfriend brought up that I journaled often because I was lonely. Yeah, that‚Äôs true, and ouch lmao. But I definitely used writing on here to make up for the fact I didn‚Äôt have much people in my life. There‚Äôs people in my life, but it‚Äôs not quite the same way my girlfriend and I are with one another. That‚Äôs what I had been looking for in my life, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm complete now. But that wouldn‚Äôt be the truth, I‚Äôm getting there. I‚Äôm definitely happier though.

There is a certain emptiness to highways at dusk, when the sun bleeds orange
 Across concrete arteries, and every exit sign promises some salvation you know will not be found.

I have measured out my life in broken white lines, in coffee cups abandoned at rest stops, in the spaces between radio stations where static speaks more truth than voices.

You said the city would save us‚Äî 
Its lights like stars fallen to earth, its noise drowning out the silence between us. But even in crowds, we found ways to be alone.

The buildings stood like sentinels, guarding secrets neither of us dared to name. We passed through monumentals like ghosts, two silhouettes against a twilight sky.

How many nights did I watch you sleep, counting your breaths as if they were prayers? 
How many mornings did we rise without speaking, the weight of unspoken words heavy as winter coats?
Let me tell you of the deserts I have known‚Äî not of sand, but of moments stretched thin, where time becomes a mirage and every heartbeat echoes against emptiness.

And yet‚Äî

There is a certain beauty in departure, in the rearview mirror reflecting what we leave behind. The highway unfurls before us like possibility, each mile a verse in the poem of becoming.

I have seen rain wash away yesterday's dust, have witnessed dawn break over industrial skylines, have felt the subtle shift when grief transforms into something resembling grace.

Perhaps we are not meant to stay, but to pass through‚Äî like light through stained glass, changed by what we touch, touching what we change.

And, somewhere, beyond the city limits, past the last streetlight's glow, there waits a morning we have not yet imagined, where even broken things catch light and shine.

I have done an indoor cycling training session (wearing my Oura ring and recording the activity via Wahoo Systm app + wearing a Garmin HR monitor), which is correctly displayed on the app as imported from Health.

Now, given that Oura has recorded the HR (I was wearing the ring the whole time), is there a way to ""assign"" those reads to the imported activity?  If not, what happens if I record the activity with the Oura ring AND also import the activity from Apple Health? Do they conflict?

MaddieInAmess ¬∑ Today 17:00

40 year old mum to twins aged 13

I left ExH last spring

He is a good man and great dad to DS - struggles with DD who is ASD and he suspects he is too

Emotionally he wasn‚Äôt very available and a general lack of affection made it feel difficult for me to be intimate sexually

DS was devastated ( and still is ) and hasn‚Äôt adjusted at all
DD says it‚Äôs less awkward without him here

Anyway a few months after the split I met someone at a work conference and we began dating - very causally as he lives a 3 hour round trip away and has his own DD aged 16 full time and 2 younger ones every second weekend

No kids involved with us / each other

Recently I have been doubting my decision to split with ExH - I‚Äôm not sure how much of this is guilt as he is also really not coping and constantly asking to come home and seeing DS broken hearted every day is killing me

I met him last week for coffee and ended up crying and saying I think I had made a mistake - he wanted to move back home that day but I said we needed to take it slowly because of the children and proceeded to cut the other guy off, explaining logistically it‚Äôs just too hard with the distance ( he says he would move areas once his DD is 18 but my DS would 100% move out if anyone moved in ) and that I couldn‚Äôt cope with the guilt of breaking up my family.

After a few days I began to miss him so much I felt unwell so got back in contact and we are meant to be meeting tomorrow evening to talk but this morning I felt really weird, took a test and it‚Äôs positive.

I am on the pill and have been for 12 years so how this has happened I don‚Äôt know.

My (35F) husband (39M) gets up at 3am for work. Awhile ago I started programming the coffee maker the night before so coffee would be ready when he gets up at such an ungodly hour. Sometimes I‚Äôd forget, and that became a point of contention - that I MUST have not done it on purpose, as a way to passive aggressively tell him to eat shit, or something. 

This has been argued about a couple times, and I‚Äôve told him I resent that it‚Äôs become an expectation. Well last night I forgot, he asked me when his alarm went off if I‚Äôd go make the coffee for him. I said yes, I was kinda coming out of my dream still, like, still waking up‚Ä¶ and he angrily sprints out of bed and says never mind, he‚Äôll just do it himself. Bc I didn‚Äôt get up the second he asked(?!) so of course I‚Äôm/we‚Äôre both cranky, I said I was gonna do it, MY BAD DUDE for not sprinting gracefully out of bed the second he asked. 

He defaulted to the classic ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I will never ask for your help for anything in life again, I have learned my lesson.‚Äù I said that‚Äôs sad, what‚Äôs the point of having a life partner then. This is where he got me: his reply was ‚Äúya, it is sad. You DONT do anything for me.‚Äù I was so taken aback by this. He asked me to list what I do for him but I was blindsided and couldn‚Äôt think of anything (though now, that I‚Äôm actually awake lol, I‚Äôve got a laundry list. Including the laundry). But in that moment I just shut down, and he said ‚Äúyou know, most wives actually cook for their husbands‚Äù. 

Guys. My husband will not touch my cooking. I put too much garlic or salt or something in a casserole 10 years ago and since that one unforgivable transgression he‚Äôs just decided he doesn‚Äôt like my cooking across the board. Whenever I cook for us, it just rots in the fridge. He won‚Äôt even try a bite of it because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a picky eater and he can just tell he won‚Äôt like it.‚Äù We ate dinner at his dad‚Äôs awhile back and his dad made this delicious bolognese sauce. Everyone (husband included) loved it. 

I got the recipe from his dad, and when I made it for us at home, he didn‚Äôt eat any. 4 days later he comes home with hamburger and a can of Hunt‚Äôs sauce cuz he wanted spaghetti, I said the bolognese sauce needs to be eaten up. He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want THAT sauce. It doesn‚Äôt look like regular red sauce from a can. I just want red sauce from a can with hamburg in it.‚Äù So‚Ä¶ I just cook for my kids. 

So this morning‚Äôs comments really got under my skin and just broke my spirit. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for here in this ramble. Validation from internet strangers that I‚Äôm not crazy?! Or that I am?!

1kh3skp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1kh3skp/piston_skipping_at_start_of_pull/,Piston skipping at start of pull,"Hello all,

I have a LP Pro millennium with the Airbuster kit installed along with a stainless sleeve. Lately whenever I go to pull a shot, I have a roughly 50% chance of the piston ‚Äúskipping‚Äù for the first portion of the downward stroke, where it won‚Äôt make any pressure and appears to be pushing water back into the boiler before it will ‚Äúengage‚Äù and build pressure to push water through the puck.

I‚Äôve disassembled the group head and made sure the piston seals were in good shape and properly installed (seals are brand new aftermarket) and that the piston is tight on the shaft. The pressurestat holds pressure between 1.2 and 1.5 bar in the boiler so I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a low pressure issue. It‚Äôs also weird that the issue is happening intermittently when coffee, grind, dose, tamp, preheat and shot pull are all the same.

I have done the backflush using the airbuster screw and a blind basket to make sure there isn‚Äôt any buildup inside the piston shaft. I‚Äôve also dumped the water in the boiler into a bowl and see some coffee grinds in there which is why I believe that some of the water coming in under the piston is getting pushed back into the boiler.

Anyone else experience a similar issue? Thanks for your support!",1,1746640329.0,LaPavoniLovers,0,1.0,False

I got TRO against my parents and my brother, though the gun was not real the threat to my family was. Uncle Henry hit the roof, whatever he said to my parents meant that they did not contest the restraining order.¬†¬†

I phoned my sister Cleo, and she was fuming, I told her that now they have failed to see their grandkids (my children) they may try to find her and her kids. She told me that she and Anthony would be careful, we were about to hang up when my niece April (14f) wanted to say hi. She was telling me how she had started babysitting and she was saving her money for a new phone. As I was talking Amber and Tiffy came home, and Amber asked who I was talking to when I said April, Tiffy ran up and snatched the phone off me to talk to her favorite cousin. I heard her ask how Bunny was, Bunny is my nephew and April‚Äôs younger brother Warren (7m). When they told me his name, I said like a rabbit warren, April laughed and started calling him Bunny and it stuck. Tiffy loves his nickname, and I am not sure she actually knows his real name.¬†

Amber was telling me that there had been another burglary in the area last night. I told her I suppose it may be added to my case then. For the past year, I have been investigating a spate of burglaries, they all had the same MO. For obvious reasons I cannot go into full details of an active investigation. The perpetrator is by-passing alarm systems and taking several easily sellable items, such as jewellery, watches, technology, and cash. Always richer houses and seemingly knows where things are. There is usually not much forensics, a footprint here or there. They have an ability to miss the cameras. This case is frustrating and is getting even more.¬†¬†

When I got to work, I walked into the office to find a file on my desk, sure enough it was the burglary that my wife had told me about. I overheard Jack and Paul talking about the fact that the DeLuca family had gotten a new capo, Tommy Franzese. Apparently, his wife was gorgeous, I was thinking if he is a capo with the DeLuca‚Äôs I would go nowhere near his wife, or I may end up ground up into meatballs. That family has never been very forgiving.¬†¬†

She was showing me the coffee shop, the nail salon where they got their nails done. The Applebee's where they had lunch, when she showed me that picture, I took the phone off Tiffy and zoomed into the background. Amber asked me what was wrong. I just said I will tell her later.

Now‚Ä¶ This company might sound familiar because they were grazed by yesterday‚Äôs digital bullets aimed at [DatamanUSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1kg1kvl/ive_got_time_rage_wifi_datamanusa_count_your_days/) and Robert (Praveen) Kashyup‚Äîsometimes spelled Kashyap, depending on which flavor of SEO roulette your palette is craving‚Äî subtly calling them out for the same level of incompetence and mismanagement.

Fast forward... As of today, I‚Äôve received a total of **5** **emails from THREE different recruiters**‚Äî**Radhika Rajoriya** (3/25 and today, 5/7), **Rakhi Kumari** (4/9), **and Ritika Gupta** (4/23 and 5/2)‚Äîall contacting me about aerospace manufacturing and technician roles based in Savannah, GA.

Let me say this with my chest: I. Am. A. Project Manager.

An advanced degree wielding, PMP-certified Project Manager specializing in treasury/finance, backed by experience in energy efficiency/environmental government policy and data analytics.  
My credentials ‚Äì and my resume ‚Äì scream that. Loudly. 

I don‚Äôt build planes, I don‚Äôt repair them, and I sure as hell don‚Äôt plan on acquiring the skills to do so. Which lets me know that not a single recruiter at this company took even a millisecond to read past line one of my resume‚Äîdespite sourcing me from **Dice**.

And **Dice**‚Ä¶ The reckless finger-fucking you‚Äôve exposed my inbox to is about to come to a *very* abrupt end.

Let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äî my resume must‚Äôve landed on some half-ass mass spam list. Even **after** I formally responded to **Ritika Gupta on 4/23**, asking to be removed from their candidate database and for all contact to cease. 

**T**his is not candidate engagement.   
It reads like chaos.  
It reads like spam.  
It reads‚Ä¶ like bullshit.

Most importantly, it feels like a slap in the face to those of us barely surviving on unemployment checks (or the lack thereof), prayer (if that‚Äôs your thing), insomnia, and iced coffee made with rural well water (which tasted like *picked raccoon knuckles*, so I poured it out - so now I'm even more pissed).

**And while I‚Äôm shaking my digital clappers‚Ä¶**

Let‚Äôs talk about u/Necessary_Waltz_3062‚Äî

The slimy little burner account that slithered out of the algorithm shadows long enough to ‚Äúinnocently inquire‚Äù in defense of **DatamanUSA** in the comments under my last post.

No post history. No credentials. No context. Just a suspiciously timed defense‚Ä¶ then **poof**‚Äîgone like an unsatisfactory one-night stand without leaving the $40 left on the dresser.  You didn‚Äôt log on/create an account to contribute‚Äîyou did it to distract and deflect.  


But see here‚Äôs where you had me fucked up:

I don‚Äôt just post‚ÄîI *track patterns. And call them out ‚Äì tactfully and publicly.*  
You left a breadcrumb trail soaked in low-level accountability and desperation, and it didn‚Äôt take much to sniff you out. My Amazon press-on pointed your snake ass out the moment I clocked your account creation date: yesterday.

**I‚Äôm a Southern woman. I‚Äôm just as surgical online as I am in-person and over the phone**  
  
So let me make this clear:

I don‚Äôt swing first.  
I pull second.  
I never miss.  
And I pull receipts like a disgruntled tax accountant with a filing system built by the Devil himself.

I‚Äôm not some job seeker fumbling in the dark. I‚Äôm your digital **Luigi Mangione**:

Petty enough to make it personal.  
Tactical enough to make it public.  
Vicious enough to make it permanent.

1kh3eu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenExplorers/comments/1kh3eu4/explore_the_aroma_arc7531sg_rice_cooker_review_is/,Explore the Aroma ARC-753-1SG Rice Cooker review. Is it worth your kitchen investment?,"Every morning in my kitchen starts with a bit of chaos. Kids running around, unfinished lunchboxes on the counter, and me, sipping coffee, trying to unravel the mystery of what to pack for lunch. Enter the **Aroma ARC-753-1SG Rice Cooker**, a compact, stainless steel wonder that manages to bring a semblance of calm to my mornings. Let me take you through my experience with this multi-tasking kitchen gadget.

**Compact Design and Build Quality**  
I‚Äôve owned both bulky rice cookers and overly flimsy ones before, but this product strikes the perfect balance. Its compact dimensions (10.38""D x 8.25""W x 9.5""H) make it easy to tuck away on a small countertop, yet it feels sturdy. The stainless steel pot and lid immediately impressed me. It‚Äôs rare to find kitchen appliances that use food-grade 304 stainless steel these days, and it adds a sense of durability and hygiene. The neat white exterior blends seamlessly with my kitchen setup, which is a mix of modern and rustic. At just 3.7 pounds, it‚Äôs lightweight enough to move around but doesn‚Äôt feel cheap.

**Ease of Operation**  
This rice cooker is delightfully straightforward. With its one-touch operation, even my tech-averse mother-in-law doesn‚Äôt feel intimidated by it. You press down the lever, and that‚Äôs it. No fiddly buttons or confusing screens‚Äîjust a tactile, old-school switch. It even automatically flips to ‚ÄúKeep Warm‚Äù once the food is cooked, which is a lifesaver for scatterbrained moments (trust me, I have plenty). Last week, I started cooking rice and completely forgot about it until 45 minutes later when I came back to perfectly warm, fluffy rice. Who doesn‚Äôt love an appliance that saves you from your own absentmindedness?

[Grab Aroma ARC-753-1SG at the best price on Amazon.](https://kitchenexplorers.com/p/b08x13gvqq/)

**Capacity and Versatility**  
This rice cooker claims to make between 2 to 6 cups of cooked rice. For my family of four, it‚Äôs a sweet spot. I‚Äôve tried cooking smaller portions, and it worked out fine without any scorching, which can sometimes happen in larger rice cookers. What really surprised me is its versatility. Apart from rice, I‚Äôve used it to steam veggies, cook quinoa, and even throw together some soup on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The bundled stainless steel steaming tray is easy to set up, letting me steam broccoli or fish while rice cooks below. This two-in-one functionality has significantly cut down my time in the kitchen.

**Accessories and Cleaning**  
The product comes with a standard rice measuring cup, a serving spatula, and a stainless steel steam tray. My kids now find it fun to use the spatula, which, in my opinion, is a parenting win. Cleanup is where it shines for me‚Äîthe cooking pot and accessories are dishwasher-friendly, making the after-meal chore a breeze. I do prefer to hand wash the pot sometimes, and it‚Äôs worth noting that it doesn‚Äôt take much effort.

**Positives**  
- Highly durable 304 stainless steel cooking pot.  
- One-touch operation with automatic Keep Warm mode.  
- Compact yet functional for small kitchens.  
- Multi-purpose use‚Äîworks for rice, veggies, soups, stews, and even cakes!  
- Dishwasher-safe components for easier cleanup.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The 300-watt power output means cooking times might take slightly longer compared to high-powered cookers.  
- Lack of advanced features like a digital timer or delay start.  
- The attached power cord is somewhat short, which limits placement flexibility.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
While I love my rice cooker, there are competitive choices worth considering. The **Zojirushi NHS-06** shares the same minimalistic vibe, albeit with an aluminum cooking pot rather than stainless steel. It‚Äôs slightly faster in terms of cooking but doesn‚Äôt feel as durable as this one. If tech-oriented features intrigue you, the **Toshiba TRCS01** offers a digital timer and multiple cooking modes but comes at a significantly higher price. For simplicity and stainless steel construction, however, this cooker easily outshines others in its category.

**True Value**  
What truly sets this product apart is the bang for your buck. Its affordable price point is the cherry on top considering the durability of the materials and the everyday convenience it provides. Sure, it lacks the bells and whistles of more expensive alternatives, but that‚Äôs precisely its charm. It‚Äôs no-nonsense, reliable, and fuss-free, all without breaking the bank.

1kh3cbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kh3cbq/the_fall_of_yorut/,The Fall of Yorut,"When I was a kid, my mother told me stories every night. As I lay snug and warm, she would regale me with tales of spirits who wander the forests of Bar Island. There were small ones which she called ""Fork Flyers"", and larger ones known as the ""Sledgestones"", but the biggest of them all was Yorut. He was a massive turtle with a head and face like that of a snail. Seven large horns formed a mane around his neck, preventing him from ever withdrawing into his shell. My mother would tell me that this is what led him to become the protector of the other spirits. Because Yorut could never withdraw, his only option when threatened was to fight to the end. She would weave fantastical tales of the twenty foot tall beast batting away bulldozers, and leering at corporate lawyers in a threatening manner.  I had figured out by the age of 12 that most of my mother's stories were just that, stories. She had spent her college years among the environmentalists, and that was very much reflected in the tall tales she created. I guess I had inherited a bit of that drive from her, as I elected to join the Forestry Service. It was during my career there that I learned that Yorut was very real.


Tuesday, February 9th, 1994 


It started as a day like any other, and quickly took a turn for the bizarre. I stopped in at Henry's coffee shop as I did every morning. Henry and I exchanged our usual pleasantries and he set right to work preparing my drink. By the time he turned back around to hand it to me there had been a dramatic shift in demeanor. Henry had always been amicable, even friendly, but this was different. His eyes were as wide as dinner plates. His usually charming smile was just a bit more rigid than usual. It looked as if making my coffee had electrified Henry with happiness. 


""Uh, hey man are you okay?"" I asked

""Oh you betcha, I just feel so good all of a sudden it's impossible not to smile."" Henry replied, beginning to rub his own face as if his skin were velvet. 

""Well let's hope you put some of that sunshine into my drink"" I laughed and asked Henry how much I owed him. 

""It's on the house!"" Henry shouted, before adding ""IN FACT, FREE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE"" 


Henry's grand showing of goodwill had brought light into the hearts of everybody there. It's amazing sometimes how something so small can make people so happy. I was even more amazed to see the ripple effect it had caused. As I drove out of the town on my way to work, I passed John's used car lot where he was putting up crudely made cardboard signs which read ""Zero money down? Zero money EVER!"" People were filing out of the local Walmart with cart after cart full of unpurchased goods. Everybody involved, be they customer or staff, was grinning from ear to ear. I heard people on the streets shouting greetings to one another. I watched the town mayor, Jonah Newport, climb into a car with a perfect stranger just because he had asked. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be a new revolution of love and brotherhood unfolding before my eyes. The reality of the situation was much more... complex. 


After the chaotic charity and fraternity of the morning I was excited to get out into the forest and enjoy the stillness of nature. I spent most of the day walking the trails checking for litter and signs of wildlife. By the time I had nearly finished my rounds the sun had begun to sink in the western sky. If it weren't for the encroaching darkness of the evening I may never have seen the streaks of glowing purple light darting around the trees. As I approached the area where I had seen them, I began to hear noises. Wet, popping thumps followed by small screeches. The sound of rock striking against rock, each time accompanied by a breathy ""kuh"". Another twenty feet and I could see the purple streaks a little bit better. Leathery wings held their slight frames aloft, bodies no more than two inches across at their widest, with long drifting tails which ended in a two-pronged pitchfork. My eyes widened as the implications of what I was seeing began to dawn on me. ""Flying Forks"" I thought ""no, wait. It was 'Fork Flyers'."" 


Creatures straight from my bedtime stories now danced before me, each taking its place in a great ring which made its orbit around some unseen object. I was rooted in place as I watched their silent parade. I noticed after a time that not all of the Fork Flyers were glowing with that unearthly shade of purple. The ones who had lost their shine peeled off from the rest and flew inward. In the stories my mother had told me, Fork Flyers were never mean, unless they were hungry. That little tidbit is what drove me to make the unfathomably stupid decision to try and slip past the ring. I waited, taking care to identify a portion of the ring where the Flyers glowed brightest. I surmised that the brightest of them might have been the most satiated, so I counted the seconds it took for my group to come around, and when it did I ran like hell. 


Diving under the ring of Flyers I scrambled to my feet and ran for cover as fast as I could. The foolishness of my decision loomed over me, growing in size with each passing second, until I had made it far enough to feel safe hiding once more. I moved between the trees, ears alert for any sign of hungry Forks flying my way. When I finally saw him I was stunned. It was Yorut. He was everything the stories said he was. Easily 40 feet from head to tail. His seven horns protruded high into the sky. Each leg a mighty trunk like that of a Redwood. He was magnificent. He was awe-inspiring, and he was dead. The Fork Flyers covered every inch of exposed flesh. Hundreds upon hundreds of pitchforks stabbing into Yorut's increasingly mangled body. More stood in wait, perched along each of the seven horns which crowned his head. As they fed, the tails of the flyers began pulsing with a faint light which suffused their bodies. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when a flyer, the most luminous of his cohort, flew away to rejoin the great ring. 


I could see groups of blue humanoid figures sitting in tightly knit circles. Each one had a large, rough patch on their forehead. They took turns bashing these patches against Yorut's shell, attempting to break it open. When their efforts were successful the peaceful, cooperative circles turned into violent feeding frenzies. Elbows flew with wild abandon as each of the Sledgestones fought to rip away chunks of the Grand turtle's flesh. Unlike the Fork Flyers, the Sledgestones did not seem to ever reach satiety. 


I was so engrossed in watching the beasts of my imagination devouring the hero of all my favorite stories that I had failed to hear the sound of leathery wings slipping through the night air. The Fork Flyer must have been making its way to Yorut when it spotted me and decided I might be easy prey. As it approached me the Flyer's tail stretched impossibly far, impossibly fast. The twin prongs of its tail planted themselves on both sides of my neck, narrowly missing a fatal blow. The prongs atop its head were the next to come. Another miss, with the creature's vicious face held mere inches away from me by its own tools. Teeth lined its oval mouth, gnashing and screeching in its struggle to reach me. I would love to say I took action.  That I dislodged the creature's tail to make my escape, but I didn't. I didn't even scream. I just stared at the Flyer as it snapped and screeched at me, knowing I was trapped. 


A streak of blue obliterated the winged devil before colliding with a tree in its path. The Flyer had been destroyed, but the tail remained lodged in the tree holding me still. Its severed head continued to gnaw uselessly at the distance between us. A Sledgestone, late to the party, had arrived just in time to save my life. It got up, shaking the concussion out of its head, and locked its eyes on mine. The blue giant was easily 9 feet tall. It was covered in hair, like the fur of an animal, and it was beginning its charge. I moved as much as I could manage, only just avoiding my right leg being turned to paste. The vibrations from the impact loosened the Flyer's abandoned extremities. I pushed with all the strength of desperation and I was made free, but not yet safe. The Sledgestone was recovering quickly. I ran like hell through the forest, all the while made aware of my pursuer by the thunderous slam of its skull against tree after tree. I drove straight home and didn't come out of my bedroom for two days. 


Tuesday February 10th


I had thought that isolation would be good. That it would help me sort out my thoughts, but in reality I was only spinning in circles. I had a long list of questions to answer and I had gotten stumped by the very first: How was any of this real? These were supposed to be nothing more than legends that teach kids lessons. Like the legend of Yehankaru, a shapeshifter who would lurk in the shadows of prosperous civilizations, stealing away anyone who allowed it to lure them to a secluded area. Easily the most heavy-handed metaphor for ""stranger danger"" I had ever seen. 


Wednesday, February 11th


I made my way into town for a coffee and a bit of normalcy. As he made my drink for me, I noticed that Henry's lunatic grin now needed to be frequently reapplied. Whatever ecstasy had overcome the town seemed to be fading. The signs at John's now half-empty car lot had been changed to say ""TWO DOLLARS DOWN?! Get outta town!"" The employees of the depleted Walmart shrugged at customers perusing barren shelves. The same vehicle that had picked up the mayor was now offering Harvey Potler a steak dinner if he got in the car. Harvey accepted the offer in the end. On the surface it was all still friendly, but the cracks were beginning to show. 


I arrived at the Ranger's station to find my superior, Terrence Howard (not that one), with his head in his hands. People had been going missing along trails in record numbers, and not just near our station. All across the island, men and women were failing to return from things as mundane as trips to the grocery store. I tried to tell him what I had seen in the woods, but I couldn't find the words. In the end, I only irritated him further with my stammering.


""Damn it, Brantley, either spit it out or get the hell out of my office. I don't have time to play charades when half the fucking town is missing."" He glared at me as he spat out the words. I couldn't find a way to explain without landing myself in a straitjacket. I thought maybe it would be easier if I showed him. 

""Will you come with me?"" I asked timidly, ""I can't find the words."" 

Terrence Howard's expression softened. Terrence was a good man, albeit a good man under an extreme amount of stress. He sighed. ""Fine,"" He said ""but we need to be back before noon."" 


We stared at the churning festival of consumption for what felt like days. The Flyers continued their skewering of the great beast. Sledgestones crowded in larger groups as the available real estate on Yorut's back dwindled. New species of creature had turned up to the feast. A face set in a flat area about the size of a beach ball with five appendages reaching toward the sky. They resembled human hands sprouting from the ground. Using their ""fingers"" to climb, they made their way to one of the Sledgestones' abandoned portholes before setting their rat-like faces down in the entryway. Wolves the size of moose stalked around the corpse, slipping in to tear away chunks of destroyed flesh before retreating to their pack. Their jet black fur danced with greens and blues as they ran. It was one forty five when Terrence turned to me and asked the question that had been burning in my mind since I found Yorut. 


 ""What the fuck?"" 

""...Yeah..."" was all I could offer. 

""Why didn't you say anything when you found it?"" Terrence asked. 

""Respectfully, sir, I had no idea how to explain this."" I replied. 

""That's...fair..."" he said. ""What the hell are we supposed to do about this, Brantley?"" 


I was relieved beyond measure to hear that. ""We."" If I were going to be grappling with the impossible, at least I wouldn't be doing it alone. Easy come easy go, I guess. 


We were halfway back to the station, walking together in stunned silence, when we first saw them. Dark shadows in the depths of the forest. Terrence must have noticed them first. He spoke quietly. 

""Keep your eyes trained forward and do not slow down. I don't know what they'll do if they know that we're aware of them. It's just a quarter mile to the station now."" 


The small sign signifying the first set of guest restrooms verified his words. I did as I was told. Never letting my attention wander too close to the many lights of unblinking eyes. Through my peripherals I could see that not every figure was whole. Some only had a single glowing ember set deep into the skull. Others had tiny twin stars blazing in their ocular cavities. The figures were of different sizes. Some big, some small. Some thin, some more rotund. Their unified gaze followed us all the while. Quiet. Patient. Hunters waiting for a chance to strike. 


We reached the station after fifteen minutes which each felt like seven. The feeling of elation from safely completing our journey hit me like a truck. I felt that as long as we could reach the station, everything would be alright. It wasn't until we had shut the door behind us that I remembered what we were doing. Noting had changed. We had made no progress. We were only seeking a shelter from which to wonder about what the hell was happening. We were every bit as lost as when we had set out. We sat together in total silence for an hour or two. 

""My mother used to tell me about these things."" I said. ""In stories when I was a kid. I never thought any of it was real. Half of the time she would make Yorut, that's the dead guy, into a pseudo-Captain Planet figure."" I continued, ""the ones with points at each end are called Fork Flyers. She called the blue ones 'Sledgestones'. She never mentioned the wolves or the hands."" 

""Perhaps it's related to some old folklore. Your mother had to get these stories from somewhere, right?"" Terrence Howard posited. 

I had been thinking much the same. I was ready to look up information on the town's legends when Terrence told me there was no need. 

""I keep a book of old tales in my truck."" And his face fell as if he were ashamed to say, ""I...I use the stories to scare hikers sometimes."" 


I laughed at the admission, as Terrence walked outside to retrieve the book. The mistake was revealed to me immediately. Terrence had been gone for just under a minute when the silence of the night was suddenly broke by the sound of a hundred footfalls. In the middle of the cacophony I could hear a single voice crying out. 


""Waitwaitwait NO. Brantley! Help...help...help"" the voice of my only companion in this crisis faded meekly into the distance, drowned out by the whooping cries of his captors. 


Thursday, February 12th 


I filed a missing persons report. The clerk told me that Terrence would mark the 237th person to disappear. She informed me of this with an air that said ""don't get your hopes up"". I should have taken that bit of unspoken advice. 


The air in Henry's coffee shop seemed different today. He, along with his customers, had all adopted a slight scowl. The overall mood felt...melancholic. Henry grumbled at my coffee as he poured it, and gave it to me with his other hand outstretched. 


""What, no more free coffee?"" I asked, unserious. 

""PLEASE. Just stop. I'm not in the mood for this kind of crap today."" He bristled all over as I noticed the empty glass cases which usually held a variety of food items. ""The city says I didn't have the proper permits for giving away coffee. If you ask me, they've got it out for me."" 

""Oh geez, I'm sorry to hear that."" I replied. I meant it, Henry had always been kind. The town had come to view him as a staple. After all, what is the linchpin of society if not the local coffee shop? I put a five dollar bill in the tip jar and went on my way. 

John's signs had changed once again. This time, they read: ""I like money too, yknow!"" I could see John through the window to his office. He seemed to be hard at work crafting tomorrow's message. Elizabeth Stoltz, an older woman with a fiery temper, was in a one-sided shouting match with the vehicle which had been collecting townsfolk. 

""How dare you proposition me, sir? I am a lady. I will not be getting into a car full of strange me-"" her sentence cut off as a wiry arm reached out in a flash and dragged her into the vehicle through the window. I tried to catch the car's license plate number, but the letters appeared to be shifting constantly. If anybody else on the street had noticed, they didn't give any indication. I decided I would go and try to retrieve the book Terrence had mentioned. The journey was largely uneventful. Once or twice during the drive I caught sight of people hiding (poorly) behind trees. You know that thing kids do where they hide behind something that barely obscures your vision of them? It was like that. 


The book was not worth the uneventful drive. Aside from a passing mention of Yorut, I found absolutely nothing. No Fork Flyers, no Sledgestones, nada. If my mother were still with us I could ask her directly where her old stories came from. In that moment, I missed her more than usual. I sat back, drinking in the silence of the Ranger's station, thinking of the woman who had raised me. 


Bereft of answers. Still. I found myself curious about the state of Yorut. After what had happened to Terrence, I was taking no chances. I fired up the drone we use to scout for missing hikers and sent it on its way. 


Shards of shell littered the clearing. Every inch of ground not covered by the fragments lay soaked in a viscous purple fluid. The Fork Flyers had disappeared from the immediate area,  seemingly all moving to the great ring which still made its orbit around the corpse of Yorut. The Sledgestones were standing in a massive huddle, desperately beating back the titanic wolves which had appeared. The hands had grown additional appendages which slithered their way across the bloodied ground looking to grab up anything it found. One of the hands, which had used its newfound tentacle to snatch up a Sledgestone, was pierced from within by a coalition of crimson worms. Their slender bodies tapered into points that looked sharp enough to pierce Kevlar. I turned the drone around to bring it home, only for it to be chased down and knocked out of the sky by a curious Fork. 


It seemed to me that the feast was reaching its end. There wasn't enough of Yorut left to sustain the creatures, and they had begun to turn on one another. Perhaps this problem would solve itself. If I could just wait a few days, the corpse would be fully depleted and all this craziness might finally end. 

So of course, shit hit the fan the next day. 


Friday, February 13th 


Bedlam had come to town. Henry stood outside of his coffee shop yelling at passersby. 


""MY BUSINESS IS FAILING BECAUSE YOU GREEDY FUCKS DON'T PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE"" he raged, stopping himself for a moment to say hello to me, before launching further into his tirade. I stopped in at the police station to check for any sign of Terrence, and I found more than I had bargained for. Two hundred and fifty missing persons had all shown up to the station that morning, and among them were Harvey Potler, and Terrence. I was elated. 

""TERRENCE"" I shouted, causing him to stumble slightly in surprise. ""I'm so glad you're okay, what the hell happened?""


""Huh?"" Was his initial reply, hastily adding ""Oh, that. Yeah I got loose about an hour after they took me. Ran all night. Thank goodness I found a trail. I could have died out there, Brantley."" 


""Dude, I know!"" I finally took a good look at him. Terrence looked like shit. His clothes hung loosely off his body. Occasionally a rib would show through the shirt as he moved. He was emaciated, as if he had been starving for days when no more than 36 hours had passed. In fact, all of the returning vanished looked brutally thin. I brushed it off, making a mental note to get this man a cheeseburger ASAP. 


As we drove aimlessly through town, the relationship between Terrence and I was flipped on its head. Usually I'm the one making impractical suggestions to irritate Terrence. Today, apparently, it was his turn. 


""Maybe we should go scope out the corpse again"" he said. 


""I don't see much point in that."" I replied. The scene had remained, at its core, largely the same since I had discovered it. With the feast tapering off, I didn't know what information we could possibly glean from another look. Terrence, to his credit, dropped that particular suggestion. However, it was immediately followed up with another. 


""Well, there's all these old sewer tunnels. Maybe there's something to investigate down there."" He sounded desperate. I understood exactly how that felt. I just wanted an answer. I would have gone down into those sewers, had I seen anything at all to suggest they held clues for us. 


""The sewers? Are you feeling okay, man?"" I was worried about my friend/boss. He had been abducted by creatures of the forest. Who knows what that's like, other than him? I could forgive him for being in a bit of a fog. 


""Yeah, I'm totally fine I just think we should go somewhere that nobody else goes. If there was something to see where people go, then somebody would have seen it. We should be checking the areas where there are no other peo-"" his words were cut off by the shattering of the passenger side rear window. John stood at the edge of his empty lot, shotgun in hand. He had a look on his face of bewildered animalistic rage. He racked another shell and took aim once more. The pellets punched dozens of tiny holes in the passenger side door. They tore around Terrence's legs, some even leaving holes in his pants. Miraculously, he was unharmed. I sped away as fast as the vehicle would allow. 


Everywhere we went, there was chaos. Walmart was completely engulfed in flames. People shouted obscenities at one another. Fights to the death were breaking out over every minor disagreement. Terrence and I had been watching Jane Turnbull giving Gabe Trund a beatdown over ""the good cart"" at Aldi. Suddenly, Terrence stiffened before saying ""too late"" and sprinting away into the streets. I gave chase, but he was impossibly fast. I didn't catch up until we had made it to the town square. What I saw there made my next decision extremely simple. 


The formerly missing had converged on the area. They all stood around, slack jawed and staring at the clock tower in the center of town. A straggler, who I recognized to be  Jonah Newport, arrived on the scene and it was as if a switch had been flipped. Two hundred and sixty seven bodies simultaneously disrobed. Their heads sat atop bodies devoid of flesh. Held aloft and upright by nothing more than bones which had been brutally marred. Looking closely at Terrence, who was nearest to me, I could see the marks of gnawing teeth along every inch of exposed bone. The missing climbed over top of one another until they formed a massive human pyramid. Jonah Newport climbed to its apex and proceeded to dive  directly into the mouth of Lane Pommson. As Jonah made his way toward the ground, the rest of the pyramid followed suit. Those standing on the ground were flung high into the air. The pyramid stood inverted as Jonah slid into the dry earth with a squelch. The others did not follow Jonah on his subterranean journey. Instead their bodies smashed against the earth, their skeletons scattering in all directions, leaving only a pile of still animated heads surrounded by thousands upon thousands of bones. Each head was spewing a word salad the likes of which has never been seen. The cacophony of their pointless vocalizations was nearly as disturbing as what had led them there.


That was when I made the best decision I had made all week. I left. As my battle scarred Corolla rolled away from the town of Bar Harbor, I could just barely see a long line of purple streaks flying away from the clearing which had become Yorut's grave.",1,1746639260.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I make a strong pot of Yerba mate in a French press (about 3 cups worth) then put it in the blender with a little more than a tablespoon of coconut oil, and half a teaspoon of cardamom which is supposed to help your body process caffeine more slowly so you don't have a crash (it's an Ayurvedic thing). 

I haven't had the same results doing this with coffee, or with Yerba mate on it's own, which tends to make me feel jittery and over caffeinated.

1kh3brd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1kh3brd/results_walking_experiment_to_help_with_sleeping/,Results: walking experiment to help with sleeping,"I have had trouble sleeping since childhood. I kid you not I was in pre-school at nap time pretending to sleep. In elementary school when my parents sent me to bed I played with my stuffed animals until I fell asleep hours later. 

Sleep has never been easy for me and over the last 2 years as perimenopause became readily apparent it has been so much worse. 

I thought I was doing ok until winter hit. I had more stress in my life: moving, work, and I have been a mess for weeks now. Going to bed too late. Not sleeping well. All sorts of stuff. The time change kicked my butt worse than usual. 

I have been off an on exercise recently, but I live a car-lite lifestyle so I am decently active as I just walk everywhere and to all my errands. I also walk after work a couple times a week. 

I have been wanting to experiment with daylight exposure - as I have seen a bunch of articles that say daylight exposure - the earlier in the day the better - helps to keep your circadian rhythms on track. So my goal is to get this done before 8:30a. I think before 9a is the magic window. 

I work from home, so this new pattern killed my commutes that offered that morning light. 

In pre-pandemic times I took transit/walked/biked to work before and got some outside light during my commute. 

So for the month of April I decided to make a concerted effort to get a short walk in first thing in the morning. I decided to wake up about 20-30 minutes earlier and go outside for 20-30 minutes. 

In reality I just moved my afternoon walk to the morning, no major change in my activity levels. Maybe a 500-1000 extra steps a day on my 8-10k average. 

In terms of pace - it has been variable based on my energy and mood. Some mornings I was in a speedy mood. And others just a moderate one. I am spending 20-30 minutes in a loop in my neighborhood. 

I am shocked how much it has helped my sleep.  By the second or third day I was sleepy at like 10-10:30. Usually I aim to go to bed around 11:30 but it is rare I am actually sleepy. It usually pushes to midnight. I have been going to bed before 11 almost every night. 

My sleep quality has been better and I haven‚Äôt had as many of those 3-4a wake ups either. 

Last week I was traveling and I wasn‚Äôt quite on my schedule. I didn‚Äôt get as much morning walking / daylight exposure in and it is showing up in my sleep this week.  But I am back on track since I am back at home. 

It has been so effective for me - to go outside for a walk early, I wanted to share.  I saw some articles that said even drinking your morning beverage outside for 15 minutes helps. I don‚Äôt have a patio or yard so it is just as easy to go for a walk. But it might be the coffee outside that works for you.

I think this guy is where Rustage explicitly started to set up something for Ragnar. There might have been other stuff in Kane and the sisters, but we don't know yet. But Tavrock is the brute strength, violent, zoan-using, surprisingly erudite, and delusional guy that forcefully creates a family. He is the most explicitly like Ragnar. I standby that he was created to prime the players and give them no excuse to save Ragnar as their marine characters. The guy infected Taiga, abused Heather, imprisoned Raj, and tortured Anchor Arms. And Ragnar would likely do something similar if he had the opportunity while facing them.

**Gus**

Gus was there to show the Crown Slayers the corruption within the world government. Since Ragnar is a yonkou, cipher pol is more than likely to be dealing with him behind the scenes so that they can get blue blood and other resources. 

**Heath**

This guy is a bit of a repeat for Tavrock, but specifically for Briggs. By showing that his character would even kill his own father, who also has a dead wife and estranged kids, then Briggs can't reasonably hold back Bradley from potentially executing Ragnar.

**Hemlock**

I consider her the overarching antagonist of Lur and Scourge's portion because she gave the orders to them. Also, I think she is there to show that the pirates characters can have incredibly different characters based on the point of view. The DLP engaged with her as a sultry, mature, motherly professional assassin. But Branch 101 sees her very differently. All Damian knows about Hemlock is that she is named Hemlock, she hired idiots like Lur and Olaf, and she makes them shit in holes instead of using a toilet. In his eyes, she's an idiot psychopath.

Ragnar is similar. If you describe him in an uncharitable way, he's a guy willing to kill basically anyone for arbitrary reasons. Who he designates as a family member can change rapidly. Ragnar IV and Not Steve were sons to him, and he still killed them. No doubt that he loves the DLP, but if they got in the way of him and his new friends, I think that Ragnar would choose the latter. He also wanted to enslave a random woman who gave them coffee.

**Taigasite and the Emperor**

I do not think that Ragnar became a yonkou all on his own. He likely has his own Streusen or Orochi (I think it might be Rick). He is also deeply afflicted with blue blood. I see this arc as an analog to that situation, with the emperor as the manipulator and Taigasite as the thing that needs to be cured. It also casts Branch 101 in a better light, because they are willing to go out of their way to cure their friend. William just plain forgot about the fact that he could potentially cure Ragnar.",3,1746639086.0,OnePieceDnD_Rustage,2,1.0,False

1kh398s,https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1380910/view/521964211468763321,Ship Combat - Major Update!,"***Greetings, Space Travelers!***

We are excited to announce the release of the Ship Combat major update! Let's take a look at the noteworthy changes it brings.

# A day in the life

At last, the Stardeus Universe won't feel **as lonely** anymore. You will encounter **NPC spaceships** that are busy going about their own adventure. You will be able to interact the same way they interact with each other. As a player, you won't get any  ***special treatment*** . While there will be **some scripted story events** involving NPC ships, most interactions will **happen organically**.

# Live and Let die

**Ship to ship combat** was the most requested feature **of all time**, and it's  **finally here** ! All ships (including space stations) **can** ***be attacked*** . Ships will also be able to attack each other and ***YOU!***  It's even possible to fight  *more than* ***one***  opponent at once!

**Ship combat** is inspired by two legendary games - **Starsector** and **FTL**. If you've played those, the combat will **feel** familiar.

Several new ship devices were added to make combat possible:

* 5 types of weapons (Ballistic, Laser, Missile, Plasma, and Point Defense)
* Shield Emitters replace Quantum Barriers and protect the entire ship regardless of placement
* Flux Capacitors will \[strike\]charge your DeLorean\[/strike\] increase the amount of damage your shields can absorb before overloading

*Please* , take the **Ship Combat tutorial** to learn all the new mechanics and complete the new ""Make Ship Combat Ready"" quest to arm yourself acordingly.

Defeating a ship turns it into a ***Derelict*** that you can approach and salvage. The destroyed ship‚Äôs surviving loadout may appear as loot.

# Ship Interactions

Several  **types of interactions**  can happen between ships - either between **you** and **NPCs**, or between **NPCs themselves**:

* \*\*Hail: \*\*Any ship can hail another to initiate a chat and trigger interactions
* \*\*Attack: \*\*A ship can attack another or join an ongoing battle
* **Give Gift:** A ship may offer gifts to improve faction relations
* **Ask Fuel:** A low-fuel ship can request fuel, affecting relationships
* **Trade:** Some ships are open to exchanging goods
* **Extortion:** Pirates may demand ransom under threat of combat
* **Follow:** A ship may tail another out of curiosity or with later intent
* \*\*Avoid: \*\*Threatened ships try to escape and hyperjump away
* **Ignore:** Ships may ignore you, which can be a relief when it‚Äôs pirates
* **Surrender:** Only in combat, and not guaranteed to work
* **Insult:** Throw insults and see what happens

# Return Beacons

Found a resource rich sector you'd love to revisit? Drop a Return Beacon and make it one hyperjump away! This fast travel system is so good it should probably be  *illegal* .

# Warp Drives

Two new engine types make exploration **easier**. The Warp Drive lets you jump **anywhere** in your current region. The late-game Alien Warp Drive lets you warp to any region, regardless of distance. Forget hyperlane restrictions.

# UI Enhancements

The UI continues to improve. **v0.13** introduces locking tooltips and clickable text links to codex entries or object locations. If it's ***underlined***, you can ***click*** it.

As always, there's *soo* much more.

You can read the full changelog below.

And, until next time; be safe out there, *space cowboy* .

So i have this issue with my oral hygiene in which my saliva sometimes tastes (and smells) bad not just when I woke up in the morning, but even at times during the day.

For context, i am a heavy coffee drinker and i am a fan of sweets too. I habitually gargle with water every morning after i wake up and i am trying to add the habit of drinking plain water after I drink coffee. I also started scraping my tongue when i brush my teeth (twice a day). My gums tend to bleed often these days so maybe that contributes too to my problem :(

I want to address just so I have a better overall hygiene, and because I tend to do oral s*x a lot (i'm üåà), so when i lick my partner, i do notice that the dried up saliva kinda smells üò≠.

1kh3566,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh3566,Low Contrast Paper Negatives,"Hi everyone,
I took a few photos on a couple homemade photos recently, and developed them using caffenol:

250ml water
36.8g washing soda (decahydrate)
4g vitamin c
10g instant coffee (the cheapest stuff i could buy at sainsburys) 

The portrait negatives from my black sliding box camera came out ok, but a bit flat. 
My negatives from my green hand camera are coming out very low contrast. The focus and compositions are also bad but im less worried about that for now (these were all just test photos).

They were developed between 3 and 10 minutes  (longer as the session went on) at about 21 degrees celsius. 

The photo of the man in the hat and the church spire both had some deep blacks, but for the most part I never got them. I pulled the negs out when I did because they started turning grey, losing detail. 
Is that an indication that I overexposed and underdeveloped? 

I used ilford multigrade paper. I rated it at iso 12 (which i think may be a bit high which makes me doubt a bit that overexposure is the issue?) and used the sunny 16 rule rather than metering. 

I know the colour of light will therefore make a difference to contrast, would this be the issue? Do I have to add a blue filter when taking photos? 

My handmade shutter may not be very reliable, but ive taken some slomo videos of it and the shutter speed seems to work at a pretty consistent speed. maybe that was just luck when i was testing though. 

one of the worst photos is a pile of logs, the wood is very dark (underexposed?) while the sky is bright, but its still grey. This also confuses my theory of it being due to underexposure and overdevelopment. 

Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks!

Blockage?","I've had my Ascaso Steel Duo PID 2 for about two years. I've consistently used the same beans and grinder (Niche Zero 2) over that time. Pressure has been set to about 10 Bar and I've made hundreds of great coffees.

Recently the flow of the coffee out of the portafilter shifted to just drips. I've had to completely coarsen the grind to make up for it, but the espressso is now rubbish.

The guage is showing the same pressure, but I can hear is water flowing back into the reservoir while a shot is supposed to be going through. The OVP seems to be working fine with a blind basket backflush, but it's weird that it's basically doing the same thing with a normal basket (same competition basket I've used for ages too).

I descaled it twice and backflushed it several times. I've taken off the shower screen and ensured that it and the head is clean. 

What I haven't yet done is unscrew the jet assembly underneath the shower screen. (I'm not sure what that part is called actually).

If you feel you must vent your frustration about it happening to you, post it here.

Remediation seems to be (at the moment) don't leave your travois loaded or unloaded outside.  If you do and it disappears you can likely recover your gear from local recovery boxes located in (I think) all zones.

If some of you would be so kind as to drop a few of the more useful discussions links on this bug I would be most appreciative.

I feel a little pathetic with this one but let me clarify.  I [36F] currently live with family due to both financial and health reasons.  We all get along fine for the most part, and they have been *incredibly* supportive over the past few years while my health has been a major issue, to the point I'm not sure where I would be now if I wasn't for them.  

Prior to my health taking a downturn, I did a lot more around the house, cooking, cleaning etc.  It's just become very difficult.  Point being, not sponging. Absolutely don't take their support for granted.  Hate not being able to do everything independently, but right now, that's life.

Because of said health issues, I keep a very detailed diary of what's been happening day to day, to pattern track, food intake etc. It's not perfect but it gives me a lot to go on when I see clinicians. 

So when mum said to me today that she ""had something to confess"", she said ""I've actually been secretly giving you lactose-free milk for 3 weeks to see if it made any difference to you.""

(To clarify, this would be replacing in teas or coffees, or on the days I struggle to make my own food, in porridge, scrambled egg, whatever else with milk etc.)

I didn't get shitty with her, I just asked her to please not do that again, since it messes with the food diary, and makes me wonder if any improvement was down to anything I personally tried, or this milk she was secretly giving me.  She said she only didn't tell me ""to avoid the placebo effect"".

But quietly, I was also a little pissed off.  I don't feel I have any right to be, since like I say, my family are so supportive and I know this came from a place of love and a desire to get me well.  But it still kinda feels like I've been slipped something without my consent, even if all it was was lactose-free bloody milk. 

I'm not going to make an issue of it, because really, it's not worth it.  She's agreed not to do anything like that again without asking, and I didn't have any adverse effects so.....

But I still feel like I'm overreacting by feeling so weird about it at all, especially when I know it was done with all good intentions.

Like full on panic attack before I had to go to the office. No more. Its absolutely no issue anymore. 
2.	‚Å†My insomnia is gone: I developed insomnia during my uni years. That paired with my social anxiety was ruining my life.
3.	‚Å†No more intrusive, negative thoughts: I always held negative thoughts and believes about others and especially about myself. They just vanished. They don‚Äòt come up anymore.
4.	‚Å†I am more attentive and better at listening: I can listen to people without thinking about what I should say next. I can listen to presentations at work without getting distracted and I can watch a full length movie without the need to check my phone.
5.	‚Å†I am more compassionate. I think its because I can truly listen to people again. When they tell me about a problem I feel a sense of compassion and belonging.
6.	‚Å†My relationships improved: This one is big and goes hand in hand with all the ones before. My relationships with my Mum, my brother, friends and coworkers all improved ALOT. There is a way more easy going vibe, way more laughing and way more deep talks now. I also feel like I attract more people in general. I guess because my overall vibe improved.
7.	‚Å†I don‚Äòt need to convince myself to do things: In the past I often needed to convince myself to e.g. take out the trash, clean my apartment, go shopping for groceries. Or I bargained with myself, like ‚ÄûOkay, I will do A but then I won‚Äòt do B‚Äú. Things like that. Now I just do it. I don‚Äòt feel super motivated to do things. They just feel easier to do.
8.	‚Å†Random moments of happiness: Sometimes just randomly a feeling of happiness overcomes me. Without any particular reason. Just feels good to be alive.
9.	‚Å†Stressful events don‚Äòt stress me anymore: I am truly baffled how things that used to stress me extremely are now just things that happen, that I can accept and move on. Without thinking to much like it.
10.	‚Å†I nap like a KING: I loved napping when I was younger. Just some good old siesta. With coffee in the morning this got impossible. My sleep still is not perfect sometimes, but when I‚Äòm tired in the afternoon I nap for half an hour and I am good to go.

I came up with the idea of posting this list, because I often saw posts about why people should quit. I hope this helps some. I just feel really REALLY good right now. And today I only hit the 2 week mark. I still sometimes have some withdrawal like fatigue. But then, I just nap and still do the things I planned on doing. The worst withdrawal symptom I currently have is the craving for coffee. Its really annoying at times, I would LOVE a cup of coffee with a sip of milk. But I won‚Äòt.

A couple of days ago my friend commented on how yellow they've gotten and I decided to finally go to the dentist for a cleaning/whitening, for the first time in 20 years (I'm in my late 20s by the way).

I was a little afraid of what she (the dentist) would say, because my oral hygiene isn't the best. I always brush in the morning, but never after meals and I forget to brush before bed most nights. Also I've never had a cleaning done in my life.

To my utter surprise, my dentist said I have some of the healthiest teeth she's ever seen in her life. I had a few tobacco stains in the back which she could easily get rid of, but other than that no problems whatsoever. She suggested I stop smoking of course, but said it wasn't necessary to whiten them because that's just my natural color. She added that the fact that they're yellow is actually a good thing because it means my enamel (or dentin?) is strong.

Thing is, my teeth look like absolute schei√üe and that's undeniable. I really have a hard time believing a heavy smoker, excessive coffee drinker with poor oral hygiene and a family history of dental problems could have perfectly healthy teeth. Especially considering how bad they look.

This isn't my photo but the color is pretty similar, if not slightly worse

I was working with a Mugen and hario tabbed papers. I also use a Hario drip assist since I don't have a gooseneck. I used the Lance Hedrick bloom plus one and got great results sometimes with the Mugen, but sometimes I just couldn't get past average with all but one of my coffees (making me wonder if that coffee could be even better).   
  
So I got a V60 and Cafec Abaca filters.

1. I bumped my Baratza Encore grind size from 23 down to 17.  
2. 15g coffee, 250g water, \~200F
3. I pour the 45g bloom with my regular kettle. Aggressive swirl
4. wait 45-60 seconds
5. drip assist on. Pour the rest of the way to 250g with some center but mostly edge pours in the drip assist. 
6. Swirl to try to add some agitation to slow it down.

In the two times I've tried this, I got a drawdown of 2 minutes flat and now 2:30 with a little finer and more swirling. Both of these were with 60 second blooms. Both tasted very weak. Maybe a hair towards bitter but hard to identify since they were so weak that it was offputting, almost like dirty water. Could've been uneven extraction. 

The 2 minute time was with a decaf, the 2:30 from today was with Onyx Santa Rosa Honey, which I can get to taste good but not great with the mugen. 

  
The coffee compass would suggest more agitation? I am afraid of causing uneven extraction. 

I do plan on getting a gooseneck at some point, but it's not in the budget quite yet.

New to espresso, new to owning a Baratza Encore ESP - having issues where the grinder retains \~5-6g of coffee per grind, and also produces small to medium sized chunks of coffee in the basket rather than a consistent fine grind.

Broader context - for the first month, it appeared to be working fine across several different bags of beans - \~17-18 grams in, only 0.1 - 0.2 grams of retention, a consistent grind fineness, spread across the 13 to 18 levels on the dial.

A week ago though, I tried to grind a similar amount of (decaf) beans - I'd used this bag before - but the grind size was inconsistent and the grinder started retaining a lot more of the coffee.

I figured after a month of use, 3-5 grinds a day, it might need a bit of cleaning - and so followed the instructions here, minus the vacuuming: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAkjJooSNs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAkjJooSNs)  (there was no shim on my unit if that matters).

Also did a lot of work with a brush trying to clear out from both ends, the grind chute.

After cleaning, it hasn't got better - I've attached a few images to highlight - from a near full clean this is what it looks like after \~3 attempts to grind 17-18 grams of coffee.

The only physical change I've made to the grinder is swapping out the traditional hopper for a single dose one with bellows (Cafemasy off Amazon).

If anyone's got advice on what I should be looking to do / how I should fix this, would welcome suggestions!

1kh2w5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialTherapy/comments/1kh2w5d/money_resentment/,Money & Resentment,"I‚Äôve found myself in a fairly common situation and am wondering if these are the kind of issues financial therapists help manage. I‚Äôm recently married, love my partner but there is an income disparity ( i make 2.7x). I knew this going into it and accepted it however as the post wedding costs come in, I‚Äôm feeling resentful.

My partner works in social services and has racked up lots of credit card debt due to the wages just not covering life expenses. It started out small but then snowballed in their early 20s and I don‚Äôt blame them at all. I‚Äôve made very responsible financial decisions, work a corporate job, and if I wanted, we could be debt free in a few hours. My partner is responsible and loving, working 2 jobs to help take the burden off but still it‚Äôs just not enough due to the high interest. They‚Äôre also working with a financial counselor and trying to learn better money management.

I have a history of financial trauma with my mom making more than my dad and my dad choosing to spend any leftover wages on siblings/extended family as opposed to us or savings. This got us in some very tough times. At one point my dad just stopped paying for things and expected my mom to shoulder it all. My partner is not this way at all. They come from poverty and I understand they were just trying to cope. Whenever they have any money leftover, they use it to contribute to the household (ie: buying something we need) or to get me a treat like a coffee or something similarly priced. I think this is a very different attitude from my dad but I have so much trauma from that situation that I feel like I can‚Äôt think clearly. I want to pay off the debt because it stresses me out but I feel like there‚Äôs no way to do that without harboring resentment.

Wilkes Blvd. United Methodist Church opened its doors in 1918. The church, which provides services and worship opportunities to many in Columbia‚Äôs homeless community, is about to face a difficult decision: Find a new way to fund the church, or close it entirely.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been a part of the neighborhood for over 100 years, (and) we hope to continue to be a part of the neighborhood,‚Äù the Rev. Andrew McCausland said.

Since 2014, the church has also been a home to Turning Point, a United Methodist ministry that serves people in Columbia who are experiencing homelesness or are at risk of a housing crisis.

Next year, Turning Point will move to the Opportunity Campus, Columbia‚Äôs new comprehensive homeless shelter and resource center on Business Loop 70. The campus will be equipped with a 150-bed shelter, community resource center, and medical clinic. Turning Point will provide daytime drop-in services.

This uncertainty was discussed over coffee last weekend in the church sanctuary. Neighbors, community members and religious leaders joined to consider what the future of the church could look like without the Turning Point ministry that has been a large part of the church‚Äôs identity for the past 11 years.

McCausland, better known by his congregation as Pastor Drew, led the conversation.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to be visioning ourselves without knowing what the community we live in actually needed and wanted,‚Äù McCausland said. ‚ÄúWe know that our previous ministry Turning Point has had some contention in the neighborhood.‚Äù

He recognized how some community members have previously expressed concerns with the influx of homeless people that Turning Point brings to the neighborhood.

‚ÄúLots of people like the idea of homeless people having resources, having a place to go, having access to showers and stuff, but nobody wants it in their neighborhood,‚Äù McCausland said.

Turning Point‚Äôs departure means more than just unoccupied space. The nonprofit has paid rent to Wilkes Blvd. United Methodist Church for over a decade. Their relocation will leave the church with a large financial gap to overcome if they hope to remain open.

After papers with community suggestions were passed out, the discussion began with a prayer asking for guidance as the church‚Äôs future was contemplated. After the prayer, McCausland welcomed all questions, concerns and suggestions.

Those who attended gave numerous suggestions on how the soon-to-be empty space could be utilized, including a shared community lending closet, life skills classes or performance arts-oriented services.

Some guests were more interested in what the future of Wilkes Blvd. could look like without a church on the corner.

Without Turning Point paying for rent, the church will have to make up the same funding in revenue.

This is a financial gap that the church‚Äôs congregation will be largely unable to help close.

The church has about 25 regularly-engaged attendees. The rest of the congregation consists of homeless members in the community. Carolyn Hunt, program assistant for the church is responsible for keeping count of the congregation each week.

On any given Sunday morning, around 50 homeless people fill the pews for the weekly 10:45 service Hunt said. The church also has 40 dedicated members in Pakistan who virtually attend the service each week.

Despite being spiritually invested, most members are unable to financially invest in the church‚Äôs future, McCausland said.

While Turning Point does not directly fund church operations or salaries, the money from their rental payments has previously helped cover operational fees to keep the lights on and doors open for service every Sunday, McCausland said.

Wilkes Blvd. United Methodist Church and Turning point have an estimated combined budget of roughly $500,000. When Turning Point moves to the Opportunity Campus, the budget will likely decrease $150,000 .

Despite the smaller budget, it will still be challenging for the church to fund its operations.

Wilkes Blvd. United Methodist Church will continue to consider their options and gather community feedback as Turning Point prepares to leave. Quarterly community meetings can be expected in hopes of finding a solution, according to Hunt.

1kh2pjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatioParadise/comments/1kh2pjl/should_you_buy_the_kotek_patio_furniture_set/,Should You Buy the KOTEK Patio Furniture Set Review for Outdoor Comfort?,"The KOTEK PI-686-HW 3-Piece Patio Furniture Set has been the talk of my porch since I got it. This outdoor conversation set, complete with washable cushions and a tempered glass tabletop, immediately integrated itself into my daily routines. From sipping morning coffee to enjoying evening sunsets, it quickly became my go-to spot for unwinding.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this set was its elegant yet sturdy design. It‚Äôs crafted from high-quality PE rattan, which not only lends it a classic and charming appeal but also makes it highly weather-resistant. Add a reinforced metal frame with a cross structure, and you‚Äôve got a set capable of holding up to 400 lbs per chair. I‚Äôve tested this durability myself by hosting a few garden get-togethers, and the chairs stayed stable no matter who sat on them. The tempered glass tabletop, held in place by suction cups, adds a modern touch and allows for easy cleaning after accidental spills.  

[Check KOTEK PI-686-HW price on Amazon.](https://patioboutique.com/p/b0bz13dph9/)  

**Comfortable Seating**  
Comfort is where this furniture set really shines. Sitting on cushions stuffed with high-resilience sponge feels like sinking into a cozy embrace. The covers are removable and washable, which is a huge plus for someone like me, whose nephew is prone to spilling juice everywhere. The ergonomic backrest and armrests have also been a lifesaver, reducing the strain on my back during longer sit-downs. I often use these chairs to dive into novels or scroll endlessly on my smartphone, and I‚Äôve rarely had to readjust for comfort.

**Usability and Versatility**  
This set‚Äôs versatility cannot be overstated. Its beige design blends beautifully into practically any outdoor setting‚Äîmy patio, the little corner of my backyard garden, and even the balcony where I tried it for a change of scenery. Whether you‚Äôre hosting a brunch or just melancholically watching the raindrops, this set creates a cozy nook that transforms the space. Its versatile nature makes it suitable for a wide range of lifestyles. My friend borrowed it for a poolside party last month, and she‚Äôs been raving about it ever since.

**Ease of Assembly**  
I‚Äôll admit I was slightly intimidated when I first unboxed the furniture. However, the clear instructions made the process relatively painless. It‚Äôs worth noting, though, to not fully tighten screws until all the holes are aligned properly‚Äîsomething I learned the hard way after an hour of tinkering. Once set up, though, it feels rock solid. The coffee table fits snugly with the chairs, and the 19.5-inch square dimensions strike the right balance of compactness and practicality.

**Highlights**  
- Durable PE rattan and a reinforced metal frame for excellent weather resistance.  
- Cushions are plush, comfortable, and washable, offering practical luxury.  
- The tempered glass table top, with secure suction-cup attachments, prevents sliding mishaps.  

**Critiques**  
As much as I‚Äôve enjoyed using this set, it‚Äôs not without flaws:  
- The assembly instructions, while clear, could emphasize the importance of aligning screw holes better.  
- Beige is a lovely color but stains show quickly, especially if you have kids or pets running around.  
- I did notice the tempered glass tabletop tends to retain smudges and fingerprints more than I‚Äôd like.

**Alternative Products**  
While this patio furniture set ticks many boxes, it isn‚Äôt the only option out there. The Greesum Patio Bistro Set, for instance, is smaller and more portable, making it suitable for people with limited outdoor space but doesn‚Äôt offer the same level of durability. On the premium end, there‚Äôs the Tangkula Wicker Bistro Set, which provides additional seating and a bit more storage functionality but comes at a much steeper price point. The KOTEK set, with its perfect balance of affordability and quality, stands out for casual outdoor enthusiasts seeking comfort, style, and durability without shelling out a small fortune.

**Smart Spending**  
When it comes to value, this set delivers impressively well for its price bracket. Considering the blend of comfortable cushions, a tempered glass table, PE rattan durability, and weather resilience, it‚Äôs an investment that pays off. It might not have the bells and whistles of pricier sets, but for everyday usability and aesthetics, it‚Äôs hard to find another option that feels quite as refined. It reminds you that thoughtful design and fair pricing can coexist seamlessly.

I really wanted a Quality Re-usable cup and my main requirement is that it would have to fit into my car‚Äôs cup holder.

I think Stanley has a great reputation so I was willing to spend more money to get it versus the dupes they sell in other stores for a fraction of the cost. It‚Äôs my forever cup, so it will be worth the $ in the long run. Elasticity matters.

I purchased a cute one and after having it for less than 3 months, I would get these black patches in the water bottle. Mind you, I haven‚Äôt been hiking or taking it anywhere too crazy, just to work and at home. I would scrub the black patches to the best of my abilities but fast forward 2 weeks and I look it up and my fear has come true that this cup has traces of lead.

It just makes me sad, my goal was to do something environmentally conscious and now I know this will end up in a landfill. My mom had several Starbucks cups and not one of them had this issue. I don‚Äôt really want to support a company that monopolized the coffee industry but like I said, I care about quality.

Wish I never spent money on a Stanley cup. Any recommendations?

There's more I just can't remember the others ..

I absolutely love my hybrids and indica dominant strains with high thc and smoke indica all day every day and I'm still productive.. 4 kids and 2 dogs, need I say anymore? ü§£ü§£
I just smoke higher thc for example I'll smash purekann 34% before bed at night to help sleep.. I need it for my chronic pain, anxiety and panic attack disorder and insomnia. And quite a few other things I'll keep to myself.. we all have our demons some we can talk about and some we wouldn't even dare think about without trauma and PTSD, let alone relive and talk about. I've chosen all the different strains I did to help with my many issues and cover all bases well and truly. 

I have more I want to try, I have my go to's I buy every time but always swap some I wasn't a fan of for something else, or I might just want to try something else . So I'll drop one or two to try others.. now i I got a mad list going on now I'm just trying different budd for the fuck of it to see if I can improve on any but I love the strains I have.

In my pics you'll see the flowers, t75 shatter, t88 diamonds concentrates for the dab rig... , flowers I currently have a and a huge box of all the previous nugs I've tried plus my cultiva and bazookas glass bottle stash. 

I've smoked for 22 years and at least 3 of them have been medicinal.. beats street weed where it's a needle in a heystack if you'll get decent nugs or not.. Russian roulette for who's got the best nugs.. 

So, what are your favourite strains? 
Have you tried any of these and what did you think? 
Any suggestions for me to possibly try other nugs that are just absolute fire, I don't know about and are the real stanky danky goodness.. send pics if available 

I'll chuck edits asap with individual nug reviews as in smoke through them. I will also take a pic of every nug I have tried...
I've kept every tub, bottle, bag or container. For my own memory when I can't remember if I have or havent tried something. Lol 

Let me know what you think, opinions, thoughts, suggestions, agree / disagree with some of my choices.. I'm all ears.. 

I'm just honestly on the hunt for the best Australian medicinal cannabis market has to offer. I always look for the best of the best and use my knowledge and many years of smoking to research what I want next.. I definitely know a good nug when I see and smell it . I usually already have a decent  idea on a flavour profile or know how it will be smoking it and tasting before I smoke it. 
No more shitty street weed hahs unless I know the person and I've seen the nugs otherwise nope. 

Anyway let me know your thoughts 
Cheers fellow smokers, dabbers and all others however you enjoy your erb. 

Cheers for reading if you made it this far and I look forward to hearing thoughts and suggestions.",2,1746637461.0,MedicalCannabisOz,2,0.75,False
1kh2ky0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1kh2ky0/how_i_quit_after_27_years/,How I quit after 27 years.,"Started at age 13 till 40. 2 packs a day sometimes. Been clean 6 months of nicotine, never went 24hrs without nicotine till then. 

Initially I was very excited for vaping and was able to quit cigs for 3 years with vape, but man did it stunt my breathing and general well being so it was time to get clean.  and as soon as I ran out of vape I would run to grab a cigar every time so I knew the tobacco still had a hold. 

So I figured if I can just beat the Nicotine I could drop the smoking fixation later. 

Here's what I used:

Korean Herbal cigs on amazon. Made from Chysthanium, honey , mint other plants. Healthy? Doubt it this Has to be temporary. Not as good as the real deal but there are some decent ones out there and they will hold you over. You Just gotta make it that first week. Hell week. 

also

Grinds coffee pouches (Amazon) its like a dip pouch, delicious and help so much with the oral fixations. Breath smells great as well. Recommend Cinnamon roll and Irish Cream.  

Also 

Essential Oil breathers, look like plastic cigarettes but are just peppermint oil and such 

Also 

Zero Nicotine vapes. Just a temporary deal but you gotta get that nicotine out whatever it takes.

  
The changes to my digestion have been wild and didn't expect. Had chronic heartburn with smoking, now that's gone. Can eat everything with no upset feeling afterwards which is a new experience for me. Overall gut health feels fantastic. 

But..

Body hangs on to everything I eat, Gained 20lbs fat rapidly despite gym 3 days a week and eating a fairly balanced diet. First 3 months was really tough, but it has balanced out and now I gotta do the work to get it off again. ",10,1746637432.0,stopsmoking,1,1.0,False

(LONG),"I have been reading this sub for a while and looking at posts about first signs of dementia. I understand that everyone has a different story and dementia looks a little different for everyone, so I know that I won‚Äôt get a definitive answer here. I guess I have two goals in mind with this post: 
To document my concerns early and get some feedback. 
My husband just turned 64. He hasn‚Äôt worked since he was let go from his CFO position in 2009. He hasn‚Äôt worked since no medical insurance until he turns 65 next spring. He doesn‚Äôt smoke, or drink but has not seen a doctor since 2019 so could have underlying health problems. 
Here is a list of some of the things I am concerned about:
*His short term memory is terrible and has been for a couple of years. 
*I have noticed little problems with his driving, making wrong turns or trying to go when the light is red ( once or twice ) He has commented that he notices himself making mistakes while driving. Most of the time it‚Äôs fine. 
*A few months ago he was bringing me a coffee to work and he called me upset and frustrated because he missed the turn and couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get to my facility. 
*A few weeks ago he left the dog (120# Pyr mix) with me at work so he could grab some groceries before he went home. And when he got home he forgot the dog and the groceries in the car for about an hour before he realized. 
*He gets easily frustrated with having to learn anything and says he can‚Äôt do it, says his brain is not able to process learning anything new. 
*He tried to read a label on the dog‚Äôs medication and could not figure out what it said. Told me over the phone that it said something completely different than what I knew to be true. 
*And then Friday he took my coffee to the wrong medical facility. He‚Äôs been coming to my hospital for three weeks and one day goes to a different hospital. (I teach nursing students at various hospitals and medical facilities.)

I‚Äôve shared my concerns but he feels like it‚Äôs‚Äònormal‚Äô aging. I try to tell him that he is not that old and shouldn‚Äôt be having all these issues. 
Maybe he‚Äôs right and I am making this into something that it is not.

1kh2aic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kh2aic/should_you_buy_the_zafro_coffee_machine_detailed/,Should You Buy the ZAFRO Coffee Machine? Detailed Espresso Machine Review,"Testing products daily has shaped my appreciation for small details. Recently, I decided to add another gem to my kitchen: the ZAFRO CM8054-BLACK Espresso Machine. It's marketed as a compact, user-friendly, semi-automatic coffee maker designed for home or office use, with a promise to transform anyone into a barista. It‚Äôs an exciting concept, but I wondered if it lived up to the hype. Here's what it was like using this espresso machine extensively.

**Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**

Out of the box, this coffee machine impressed me with its sleek black finish and brushed stainless steel detailing. It sports a compact build, with dimensions of 14.17""D x 8.9""W x 13.6""H, making it perfect for narrow kitchen counters. I can attest that placement isn‚Äôt an issue; it barely eats up any counter space. Despite its small footprint, the device feels solid and weighs about 12.27 pounds, which prevents constant sliding when operating. Every accessory, from the milk frother to the detachable water tank, is conveniently designed for easy handling.  

[Check ZAFRO CM8054-BLACK price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dbzjdjh4/)

**Ease of Operation**

Functionality-wise, this semi-automatic machine has an intuitive button interface for essential controls‚Äîmaking coffee or foaming milk. Operating it felt seamless, especially for someone like me who dreads complicated electronic gadgets. The included manuals were clear, though I barely referred to them. My first attempt was smooth sailing as the reusable filter system cooperated beautifully with my favorite coffee grounds. There‚Äôs even a capsule portafilter, but I stuck to ground coffee for my morning ritual.

**Highlights**

- **Professional 20-Bar Pump**: The 20-bar Italian pump is a game changer, delivering rich and aromatic coffee every single time. The pressure gauge serves as a helpful guide to adjust your preferences.  
- **Milk Frothing Steam Wand**: I had fun channeling my inner latte artist with the frothing steam wand. The microfoam produced is close to coffee-shop quality and pairs perfectly with espresso‚Äôs robust flavor profile.  
- **Detachable 45oz Water Tank**: Its removable design ensures a no-fuss refill and cleaning process. I brewed multiple cups without needing frequent refills, a significant bonus during weekend brunches.  
- **Cup Warming Area**: The warming tray on top lets my mugs preheat‚Äîa thoughtful touch that enhances my coffee-drinking experience.

**Favorable Aspects**

- The espresso machine's precision with 20-bar pressure extraction brings out exceptional coffee flavors.  
- Suitable build quality with a fashionable stainless steel finish.  
- Compact design is space-friendly and practical for small kitchens.  

**Operation Quirks**

I won't gloss over areas needing improvement. First, the steam wand, while effective, seemed slightly short, making frothing a bit messy if your milk jug is larger. Another observation was the sturdy locking mechanism for the portafilter‚Äîgetting it into position required some force initially. While not a dealbreaker, it‚Äôs something that one acclimates to with repeated use.

**Negatives**

- Milk frothing wand could be longer to prevent splashbacks.  
- The drip tray fills quite quickly when the machine ‚Äúdepressurizes,‚Äù demanding more frequent emptying.    
- Knob mechanisms feel stiff at first use, though this improves over time.

**Competitor Comparisons**

Many people, including me, weigh ZAFRO's performance against rival brands like the De'Longhi Dedica and Breville Bambino. De'Longhi's Dedica offers a similar professional-level brew but comes out bulkier, taking up more counter real estate. The Breville Bambino, known for its fast heating capability, has a heftier price tag. Comparing the three, the ZAFRO CM8054 has a more accessible price point while delivering comparable output and a more compact design. However, the frothing on the Bambino felt slightly superior. Ultimately, ZAFRO is a better investment for someone targeting affordability alongside high-quality espresso.   

**Cost Efficiency**

For its price bracket, this espresso machine offers fantastic value. You‚Äôre essentially getting features that machines double its cost offer, such as professional pressure pumping and frothing abilities. While skipping overbuilt extra features (like app connectivity), it retains what genuinely matters: creating delicious espresso, cappuccinos, or lattes effortlessly at home.

my friend put me on this app called Donjuan where you practice with fake convos like

‚Äúshe replies ‚Äòlol‚Äô after your joke. what do you say next?‚Äù
or
‚Äúyou matched but haven‚Äôt messaged in 2 days. what‚Äôs your move?‚Äù

you write your reply, then it literally grades you, tells you why it‚Äôs good or bad, and gives you smoother options üíÄ feels like Duolingo but for flirting lol

been messing with it for a week and I lowkey feel more confident when I text now

I mainly utilized PrepFE and took 50 of the short, category focused practice exams, 300 total practice problems. 

My strategy was to do well on 7 of the sections and guess on the remaining sections. But in reality I probably guessed on more than half of the FE exam questions. 

The exam was more difficult than I predicted. And some of the topics I focused my studies on didn't show up at all. There were also concept questions that you could never prepare for, as well as questions that seemed like plug and chug only to realize you were missing way too many variables or the equation wasn't in the handbook at all. This isn't to scare you, just be prepared to be surprised.

The first half I was pretty shook up by the whole testing environment and running on no sleep/only coffee. I guessed on literally all the math problems because I thought I wouldn't need to study that. I had focused on vectors / matrices which didn't end up helping me much. I made sure to get through the first section within 2 hours because the heavy hitting topics were in the second section. I took the break which definitely rejuvenated me and I know I did much better in the second half. The sections which are most easy to prepare for seemed to be statics, fluids, economics, ethics. 

After the exam I learned I could have used the TI-36pro calculator to calculate some of the integrals so highly recommend knowing how to use the calculator for integrals, vectors, statistics, probability etc.

It‚Äôs your boy, Criminal, and I‚Äôm back with another banger, okay? This one‚Äôs wild, no cap. Ya boy fell asleep behind the wheel on Fentanyl and Tranq while driving my mom‚Äôs $60,000 Jeep. Then the Jeep got stolen by the EMS people‚Äîand honestly, I think the cops were in on it too. As soon as we left the police station, that car was pulling out of a chop shop. You‚Äôll see what I mean. If you like this story, check out my other ones too!



Alright, so my recent run was a short one. It lasted about a month. It was a brutal one though. They always get shorter, more painful, and the shit coming out of Philly now is dog shit. Killing our own with this shit and it's fucking disgusting



Anyway, ya boy moved back to the area about 3 months ago. Soon as I got back I was on block. The only thing is the Heroin ain't heroin and the pills are pressed. Philly is the biggest open-air drug market and I was back in the middle of it. I've never liked Fentanyl but shit when you're hurting it will get you right. As far as Tranq goes it just puts your ass to sleep. Literally, the best way to explain the month run is being in a coma. Took me a month to come out of it as well.



Anyway, the first night that I went back out, I was at a bar with my friend. We were having a few drinks and I was gambling at the time. I had won like $7k that day so I was feeling good. So, we get hammered, his girlfriend is the bartender, and we're facked. So, my homie goes let's hit the Casino. So, we go and I end up losing all my money on one hand, I put it all on black. Not all $7k by the way just like $100 bucks that's all the cash I had on me, okay.



I use credit cards not cash, okay. So, anyway I lose the hand and I'm facked cuz no debit and can't take out money. So, my boy fronts me a hundred after he doubled his $100 cuz he went red. The next one I hit, smack, black! Black hits and I go nuts. I won my $100 back and then I'm like I'm cool. Well, my homie keeps going and wins a couple dollas okay.



So, we leave and head back to the bar. At this point the bar is closing it's like midnight. So it's us me and my homie and his girlfriend so she gives us the most disgusting pour of Jameson I have ever seen in my life. Down the gulag it goes and I am fucking facked up at this point, okay because casinos give you free drinks too. So, I am really, facked, okay.



I think it's a good idea to then leave. I say goodbye to my homie and his girl and we go our separate ways. Well I knew before I even got in the car that I was heading to Philly to get high. So, I get into my mom's jeep and I'm whipping through these back roads, I know how to get to Philly like the back of my hand okay I used to do it daily multiple times a day I was a facking pheen and still am, fuck u. Anyway, your boy is blasting rap the whole way I'm jamming I'm feeling good. For a heroin addict even just driving to get it makes me feel better. I feel almost high on the way there and I love the rush I guess even though I hate driving with stuff it gives me the worst anxiety.



So, I'm hammered I'm whipping and Philly is like an hour drive from where I'm at. I got there in 35 minutes probably I was going fast after. I get there and hop out the whip. This is when I meet the crackhead murderer that ended up being my homie for this month haha.



So, I hop out the whip and head to the block. I go up and grab a bundle. A bundle is typically 13 bags they throw ya 3 extra because the drug dealers in Philly are extremely nice individuals. They actually are nice okay, they are people, and honestly as a skinny little white kid walking through the hood I felt safe at all times for the most part. Obviously I was always on a swivel though cuz mothafuckas will rob ya ass if u ain't careful and ur boy was a flexer in the streets, okay. I was buying like 30 vials of crack at a time and two bundles of dope.



I was a wealthy drug addict, okay and people knew it. So, your boy grabs a bundle and I grab some Rock. Soon as I get it from the street plug I head to the jeep. I hop in the jeep and crack open the first bag, empty it on my phone, it's clearly not heroin because it's white white af. Almost too white but the other bundle is a different stamp.



Stamps are used to represent the block the bag came from and its strength. Some of the stamps say things like ""Death"" ""K.O"" ""Rocky Balboa"" ""Nicki Minaj"" and well I had two different bundles so I open a bag from each bundle and dump it on the phone. I then sniff the white powder from the first bag and the second bag is like a tan color powder which resembles heroin almost to a T. Although it was a little too bright, it was almost a yellowish brown. It was more yellow than anything which is weird but I snorted it anyway. Bang! Two lines up the nostrils that are barely intact already. Yes, my nose is facked up from all the cocaine I did when I lived in Colombia.



Anyway, I do the two lines and I feel good but it's not heroin. If you know heroin you know heroin. So, I decide to do another line of the white stuff. I do it and then proceed to take the 34 vials of crack and 26 bags of fetty mixed with tranq just in my jean pocket. I hit the gas and get on my way home. I ended up going down a one-way and I saw a cop when I did it so I facking zoomed off. I thought I was in the clear but 20 minutes into the ride home I get pulled. Cop comes up to me and asks if I'm the white jeep that was doing 80mph through the hood up a one-way going the wrong way.



I begin to explain it wasn't and that I am only down here cuz I'm looking for my friend who is missing. That's a facked up lie ik, okay. So anyway homie lets me go he knew it was me who was going down the one-way but he got worse shit to deal with. So I'm free.



I hit the gas and I'm on my way. I'm still about 40 minutes from home but I'm driving the speed limit now I'm high but still nervous af and my anxiety through the roof with all this shit on me. So, I'm driving and I guess I blacked out cuz the next thing I remember is waking up in the ER. I woke up in the ER to my parents terrified. I'm laughing because what do I find in my pocket when I wake up. All my drugs :) So I'm hype I'm excited and I'm also being an asshole. Mom and Dad I am forever sorry for my behavior as a child. It's not your fault mom you raised a good kid. The world just facked me a little bit along the way. We're good now though and will always be good going forward.



So, to continue your boy is making a ruckus and we're looking for the keys to the jeep. We then get told that the EMS people left them in the Jeep and the jeep is parked in the middle of the hood unlocked.



We're like oh okay great thanks. So we leave after about an hour of trying to get an answer about my mom's jeep keys. Finally, they tell us that and it's late it's like 3AM right. My parents have a church thing the next day they are pissed, so my dad's like we will come back to the city tomorrow and get the car after some sleep.



So, we back I get more facked up doing bags and smoking crack thinking I know everything and have everything figured out. What a facking idiot I was. Anyway I get facked up I black out and I wake up we all have coffee my mom dad and me and then bam my dad and I hit the road. We're heading down to the city to get the jeep. Mind you I decide to bring all the drugs with me cuz I didn't want my mom going through my shit and finding it and throwing it out. So I bring everything with me in my pocket. We drive to the city and we're walking around looking everywhere for my mom's white jeep.



We walk around and drive around for like 2 hours until finally we go to the police station and tell them we can't fucking find this thing. So we go and the police tell us it's on a specific side of the road but we're like we looked there already but maybe we didn't see it. It's the cops right.



So, we facking leave the police station and the place where the jeep is supposed to be parked is only like 5 minutes away so we get there quick and we jump out and we're looking again for another hour. Finally, again we're like it's not here someone stole the facking jeep.



So, we go back to the police station they tell my dad that it's parked on that side of the road and they insist. Well we left that police station and 5 minutes later we pull up to the road where they say the jeep is gonna be on and all of a sudden the jeep is pulling out of a chop shop. A chop shop is an auto body shop they typically take stolen cars and chop them up for parts. They sell the parts for money and man my mom's jeep was worth some money. So we pull on to this road right in front of us is the jeep backing out of the auto body shop. I'm yelling dad dad dad there it is there it is. My dad was so pissed at the time that he didn't react for like 10 seconds after me telling him the jeep is right in front of us. So he's like where where I'm like right in front of you. I love you dad. Anyway he sees it last second and is pointing at the guy to pull over the guy is like back up and speeds off. We didn't hear or see of the jeep for about a month after that.



Then we see it got in a massive car accident and the person driving it fled the scene. If the person in Philly who stole my mom's jeep reads this story fuck you. Also I know the auto body shop that it pulled out of and I'm coming for you boys.",1,1746635903.0,MaskedCriminals,0,1.0,False

I'm on my bdd healing and improvement journey,which is hard but we ball. I recently fully realized that, instead of crying about it and being depressed,I should do something about it. So,these few days,I have been borderline OBSESSED(i have ocd too) with glowing up(watching videos,planning,fantasizing,etc but not doing the tasks YET). I have been spending 90% of my entire time being obsessed with glowing up,looking better,etc.

So today I decided to start my glowup arc. So with the help of the internet and youtube,I made a glowup plan which I will need to do for the next 2 months. It will take me one hour to do all of them every single day. Like coffee-lemon-potato mask daily, aloe overnight every 3 days, cucumber + yoga for eyes, lip scrub every 2‚Äì3 days, sleeping on back. (i took chatgpt's help).

At first I was feeling like,yk what,I can do this. But the problem is,doing all these won't magically change my facial features and harmony(which sucks and i look like a troll).

So now I'm crying. A few days ago I felt like my natural base face is actually good and can be improved to look actress level pretty(yes,the delulu is absolutely fcking crazy lmao remembering it is making me laugh). Which is why I decided to start this glowup plan. But after writing the plan and seeing that it will take me 1 hour 1 WHOLE HOUR every single day for the next 2 MONTHS(i didnt even include the full dream more money costing glowup plan) to ""glow up"",while these past few days I have been starting to notice the ugliness and how disgusting I actually look again right after the delulu period,I fcking give up man. There is no point. All this stupid glowup shit is not going to magically make my features and harmony better.

There's this girl that's my friend,and ik her. She is the sunshine cute innocent kind. So she is absolutely not the type to lie. She told me that all she does for her hair is oiling it once a week,and for her skincare,just water and soap. AND SHE LOOKS FLAWLESS BRO.

Why the fck does she have no hyperpigmentation but I have so much? How the fck is her skin naturally so clear? How are her features so nice and harmony so balanced and perfect? She does not have to do anything. She looks good even after a long tiring day of school. While I look absolutely fcking rotten,tired and dead and wrinkled without even doing anything. Her skin is so bright,while my skin looks dull asf(talking abt brightness not color). So ur telling me that,she looks like that without even trying and I need to do all that just to look 0.001% as human compared to her? I am so cursed to be born looking like this. There are so many other girls that dont need to put effort to look flawless. But even after I do let's say a 2 hour glowup routine every single day for the rest of my life,I will still look like doo doo. Why?? Why the fck? Why can't I just enjoy life? I was just thinking how,damn,i gotta do all this while I could be enjoying my teenage years. But how do i? I can't. My teenage years have gotten ruined because of my obsession and how much I fcking hate my face. And I can't even improve my face either without plastic surgery. It's a lose-lose situation for me. What do i do man?? I don't even look human. Like genuinely,when I look in the mirror,I don't see a human. I see some deformed ugly ass monster. And I don't mind ugly ass monsters,but the ugly ass monster is ME. So how am i supposed to live life like this? I have thought abt this a lot and came to the conclusion that the only thing I can do is: not care. How do I not care?? If i looked average atleast I would care less(but would still be depressed). If I was pretty I would be living life rn. But it's so hard to not care when u look inhumane and disgusting. I give up on that stupid glowup plan. I know myself really well. Even after all that I will still cry and rot because I'll still be ugly(since the issue is my base face which i cannot change). So it's better to be option A) miserable and ugly,instead of option B)working hard to be pretty but still looking ugly,and then being miserable. I'll be miserable either way. What do i do? I have hit rock bottom. I can't improve the main issue(my face/appearance),I can't not care and just live life. I can't fix anything.

IT'S SO PAINFUL WHEN U ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PRETTY BUT THEN SLOWLY YOU START TO SEE THE UGLINESS AND ALL THE FLAWS AND NOW U FEEL EMBARRASSED CUZ U DIDN'T SEE THEM BEFORE. A FEW DAYS AGO I THOUGHT I COULD BE LIKE ACTRESS LEVEL PRETTY LMAO BUT SLOWLY AND SLOWLY I STARTED TO NOTICE THE FLAWS MORE AND MORE AND NOW I CAN FINALLY SEE ALL THE FLAWS. I GUESS IT'S BETTER TO BE MISERABLE IN REALITY RATHER THAN HAPPY IN DELUSION,RIGHT?",5,1746635687.0,BDDvent,0,0.86,False

1kh1ort,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kh1ort/help_with_2nd_hand_machine_with_some_issues_lelit/,Help with 2nd hand machine with some issues [Lelit Anita],"Hi,

I recently acquired a used Anita which looked in good shape and mostly works, but requires some care to be back in perfect shape. I'd need your help and advice on how to address the following issues:

1. The machine goes well *beyond* the 16bar mark with the blind filter on (or with heavily tamped pucks); I thought the OPV required some adjustment, which I tried to perform by turning its screw a half-turn counter-clockwise. While this should have reduced the pressure, the result I observed when testing it was the opposite. My conclusion is that the OPV is not functioning at all (maybe because of accumulated residues?) and it needs to be replaced. Do you agree? Is it dangerous to operate the machine in the meantime with the OPV blocked?
2. I noticed that, when trying to brew coffee, the machine would make a weird noise if the end of the tube that brings back water from the OPV to the water tank is not submerged (the same noise that the pump would make if trying to take water from an empty tank) even if the end of the other tube (the longest, which is supposed to take water from the tank to the pump) is submerged. It turns out that the two tubes are connected to the wrong sides of the pump, so indeed the pump is sucking from the shortest of the two. I cannot simply swap them back because they have different diameters and one of the two is not long enough anyway. Could someone tell me the specs of these two tubes? Exact diameter, material? I would like to replace both anyway, while the machine is open.
3. Since I will have to extract the boiler to replace the OPV, are there any other maintenance activities you would recommend doing now?
4. Any tips on where to source the necessary parts in France (or at least, in EU)?
5. Any other advice?

1kh1o6p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh1o6p,Resilient Lady Barcelona to Athens,"My wife and I just returned from a 9 day, 8 night European cruise on the Resilient Lady from Barcelona to Athens. This is my overall take and honest review:

Ship: 
The ship overall was very nice. It was obvious that it was newer and had lots of comfortable lounges, bars, and plenty of space to stretch out and hang out. They said that our ship was pretty full, but the only time I really noticed a crowd was on days at sea when EVERYONE was on the deck sunbathing. Even then, We had no issue finding a comfortable spot to lay out and that was getting out there at almost noon. There is PLENTY of space up on the deck! 

Cabins: 
As it was our first Virgin cruise, I didn‚Äôt spring for Rock Star status or cabin right off the bat due to the jump in price being about 3k more. I did bid for an upgraded cabin that would have been at the rockstar level, but did not get it as I only bid about $1500 and the only people that we met that won the bid had bid over 3k. I booked an XL sea terrace and it was perfect for us. I read that some thought the bathroom was small, but I found it to be suitable for the week. The XL part didn‚Äôt seem to mean a larger terrace, but a longer room with the closet next to the bed instead of beside the cabin door. Looking into regular terrace rooms as we walked by, I liked our layout much better. 

Food:
This was by far the highlight of the cruise, and obviously one of the main things that Virgin focuses their energy. It is recommended to do reservations when they open up, but we walked in either earlier than our reservation, or just decided to change restaurants and were able to get in with little wait time each time. 
The Galley is the ‚Äúbuffet dining area‚Äù but is far from a buffet. It is more like a huge group of food trucks without the actual trucks. There is a panini counter, sushi, burger bar, sweet station, taco stand, salad station, coffee section, and more, with special themed dishes each day. Though the restaurants were awesome, we chose to eat dinner here a couple of nights. I could have eaten my weight in the French fries at the burger bar! The French toast was some of the best I‚Äôve ever had!(don‚Äôt tell my grandma I said that)

The wake: a great stake house! The food is delicious but they take a little bit longer to serve you than the other restaurants, so if you have plans after, make sure to give yourself at least an extra 30 min. 

Pink agave: great Mexican atmosphere. We liked the food but it wasn‚Äôt our favorite. I got the steak and my wife got the fish. Enchiladas were fine. They had great guacamole!

Razor Dazzle: looking at the menu before hand, we almost skipped this one, but glad we didn‚Äôt because it became our favorite and one we returned to a second time. They had the best steak, and everything we had was over the top. I had the wings and fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, and my wife loved the pork belly, which she normally doesn‚Äôt go for. We both had steaks that were amazing and the desert was incredible as well. The sweet tooth cocktail was easily our favorite of the trip! 

Gunbae: this is the Korean bbq restaurant. We almost skipped this one as well, but it was so much fun! It is loud and the food is different. We honestly were more in the mood to relax and weren‚Äôt looking to meet new people and all that, but we were glad we did here. They sit you with random people, kind of like going to a hibachi place, but in a big circular booth. The tiny grill in the middle was used by the waitress to cook our food, so you didn‚Äôt have to cook it ourselves like we thought. They play a fun drinking game at the end that we will definitely be sharing at family get togethers! 

Extra Virgin: the Italian place. The food was ok here. Not our favorite. We liked the meatballs and the checuterrie board, but the pasta was mediocre. We changed our second night reservation from this back to razzle dazzle.

Test kitchen: we didn‚Äôt do this one as I heard so many mixed reviews, but we‚Äôll try it next time.

The pizza place: we only went here once at the end of the cruise, but it was more like a blaze pizza, which I love! Had there is so much great food to choose from, you just never have enough time to eat at places as much as you want! 


There were other places like the juice bar, sun club cafe, ice cream, the social club, and others that were really good as well that we were able to see, but the highlight was the restaurants and galley. 

The social club had hot dogs, alcoholic milk shakes and floats (alcohol was extra charge), popcorn and candy. We would get popcorn and candy from the social club or have it delivered to our cabin for the delivery fee and watch movies in our room every night. It was awesome! 

Entertainment: 
There were lots of activities like bingo, game nights, shows in the red room and others which people loved. We did a few workout classes but spent the most time just relaxing, walking and eating. The shows we did see were good, but a little odd and hard to follow. The people were incredibly talented, but one of the shows, Persephone was a very odd story line which was hard to follow, and required you to stand up the whole time, which we didn‚Äôt love. My parents book cruises on other cruise lines with broadway shows and ice skating and the like‚Ä¶this was not that and wouldn‚Äôt expect that on any virgin cruise. They were also by no means family friendly. There was also a casino that stayed pretty busy, but we‚Äôre not big gamblers. 

Communication: 
This would be my only real criticism. They communicate everything through the app messaging system, which is fine, but I realized this after a couple of days and missed some important information about signing up for tendering off the ship in France. It‚Äôs great that they don‚Äôt bother you with constant announcements like other cruise lines we‚Äôve been on, but they definitely did not stress enough the fact that all communication would be done through the app, and if you didn‚Äôt check it, you would be screwed. The staff at sailor services and around the ship were top notch and always willing to answer questions, but it would have been nice to know that ahead of time. We almost missed our tour due to not knowing you had to schedule a tender boat if you hadn‚Äôt booked a tour through the ship, but with the help of the staff, we made it just fine. 

Overall, we had a great time and would definitely do it again. For someone that just wants to relax, eat great food, and lounge or drink, this is the cruise line for you.

1kh1o4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kh1o4n/potential_flair_neo_flex_upgrade_300/,Potential Flair Neo Flex Upgrade? [~$300],"Hello!

**Disclaimer:** I'm not really a coffee bro, just someone who casually got into home espresso about a year ago with a Flair Neo Flex.

I've since upgraded my setup a bit and picked up the pressure gauge, WDT tool, tamper, and a 1zpresso J Ultra grinder. I'm also using the bottomless portafilter. Honestly, I *really* enjoy my espresso these days. I literally exclaim, ""this is so good!"" when I take my first sip of my americano in the morning. 

However, a few things are starting to bother me:

* The full workflow (espresso making + cleanup) clocks in at around **12 minutes**.
* I feel like I'm limited to about **15g of grinds** in the portafilter.
* The **yield** (I think that's the right term?) isn't much, so 16oz+ drinks are out of reach (and I love big drinks üòî)

So, I'm looking for some guidance from the experts! Here are the options I'm thinking of:

1. **Accept my grievances:** Maybe these are just the realities of my current setup and not a big deal.
2. **Upgrade to a fancier manual espresso machine:** Something like the Flair Pro? Would that address these issues?
   1. it seems like everything would take just as long with the flair pro ü§î
3. **Explore alternatives:** Are there other manual options I haven't considered?
   1. is there a semi-manual option where it preheats for you?
4. **Switch to a semi-automatic espresso machine:** Is this the logical next step if I want more speed and volume?
   1. Will my espresso quality go down? 

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much. I'm willing to spend *around* $300. ",1,1746635243.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

But I do notice how ""hectic"" those days feel, compared to days with more intentional breaks and proper nutrition. And I find myself binge eating at night, cuz I'm trying to make up for the calories lost. So I justify ""unhealthier"" options like pizza or a pint of ice cream cuz I'm like ""oh I barely ate today.""

I want to try to break this cycle. Physically and emotionally. Eating is so effing triggering already, just being a woman. let alone an ADHD woman. in which some of our traits have been glamorized in diet culture.

This feature allows users to select the exact temperature they desire, typically within a range of 100¬∞F to 212¬∞F (40¬∞C to 100¬∞C). precise temperature settings are crucial for brewing different types of tea, such as delicate green tea that requires lower temperatures to avoid bitterness, or robust black tea that needs boiling water for optimal extraction.

**Keep-Warm Function:**

The keep-warm function maintains the selected water temperature for an extended period, usually ranging from 30 minutes to an hour. This is particularly useful for individuals or families who consume multiple cups of hot beverages throughout the morning or afternoon, eliminating the need to repeatedly reheat the water.

**Digital Display and Controls:**

Many electric kettles with temperature control feature a digital display that shows the current water temperature and selected settings. Touchpad or button controls allow for easy and intuitive operation,making it simple to select the desired temperature and activate other functions like the keep-warm mode.

**Boil-Dry Protection:**

This safety feature automatically shuts off the kettle if it is accidentally turned on without sufficient water. Boil-dry protection prevents damage to the heating element and reduces the risk of fire, providing peace of mind to users.

**Stainless Steel Construction:**

High-quality electric kettles with temperature control typically feature a food-grade stainless steel interior, which is durable, rust-resistant, and easy to clean. Stainless steel also ensures that the water remains free from unwanted tastes or odors that can be imparted by plastic or other materials.

**Gooseneck Spout (Optional):**

Some models are equipped with a gooseneck spout, which provides a slow, controlled pour. this is particularly beneficial for pour-over coffee enthusiasts,as it allows for consistent water distribution over the coffee grounds,resulting in a more balanced and flavorful brew.

Key features of the electric kettle with temperature control include:

* Precise temperature settings
* Keep-warm function
* Digital display and controls
* Boil-dry protection
* Stainless steel construction
* Gooseneck spout (optional)

## core Benefits

**Improved Beverage Quality:**

The ability to precisely control water temperature significantly enhances the quality of brewed beverages. Different types of tea, coffee, and other infusions require specific temperatures to release their optimal flavors and avoid bitterness or under-extraction.

Such as, green tea brewed at too high a temperature can become bitter, while French press coffee benefits from water that is just off the boil. Using an electric kettle with temperature control ensures that beverages are brewed at the ideal temperature for maximum flavor and aroma.

**Enhanced Convenience and Efficiency:**

Electric kettles with temperature control offer greater convenience and efficiency compared to traditional stovetop kettles.They heat water quickly and automatically shut off when the desired temperature is reached, saving time and energy. The keep-warm function also eliminates the need to repeatedly reheat water,further enhancing convenience.**Increased Safety:**

The boil-dry protection feature and automatic shut-off functionality provide increased safety compared to traditional kettles. These features prevent the kettle from overheating and potentially causing damage or fire. The absence of an open flame also reduces the risk of burns, particularly in households with children or pets.

**Versatile Usage:**

electric kettles with temperature control are not only useful for brewing beverages but can also be used for a variety of other culinary tasks. They can be used to quickly heat water for instant noodles, oatmeal, baby formula, or to preheat water for cooking recipes. the precise temperature control also makes them ideal for sous vide cooking or other applications where accurate water temperatures are required.

**Stylish Design and Aesthetics:**

Many electric kettles with temperature control feature modern and stylish designs that can complement any kitchen decor. They are available in a variety of colors, materials, and finishes, allowing users to choose a model that matches their personal style and preferences.

## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal temperature for brewing different types of tea?**

The ideal temperature for brewing tea varies depending on the type of tea. White tea typically requires water temperature between 170¬∞F and 185¬∞F (77¬∞C - 85¬∞C), green tea between 175¬∞F and 185¬∞F (80¬∞C - 85¬∞C), oolong tea between 180¬∞F and 205¬∞F (82¬∞C - 96¬∞C), black tea between 200¬∞F and 212¬∞F (93¬∞C - 100¬∞C), and herbal tea between 208¬∞F and 212¬∞F (98¬∞C - 100¬∞C).

**How do I clean an electric kettle with temperature control?**

To clean an electric kettle, first unplug it and let it cool fully. Fill the kettle with a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then let it sit for 30 minutes.Discard the solution and rinse the kettle thoroughly with fresh water.For stubborn mineral deposits, you may need to repeat the process or use a commercially available kettle descaler.**What are the benefits of using stainless steel over plastic in an electric kettle?**

Stainless steel is generally considered a safer and more durable material for electric kettles compared to plastic. Stainless steel is non-reactive, meaning it won't leach chemicals into the water, and it is indeed also more resistant to corrosion and staining. Plastic kettles, conversely, may potentially leach chemicals into the water, especially when heated, and can also become discolored or brittle over time.**Is it worth paying extra for a gooseneck spout?**

A gooseneck spout is particularly beneficial for pour-over coffee enthusiasts, as it allows for a slow, controlled, and precise pour. This is essential for achieving even saturation of the coffee grounds and extracting the optimal flavor. If you primarily use your kettle for brewing tea or other beverages, a gooseneck spout may not be necessary.

i had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last week for some fatigue symptoms (most likely deficiencies as dairy & onions are my main triggers) and she offered me mebeverine - i was a little sceptical at first as i‚Äôd read some posts of people saying it had no effect on them, and i worried that since it‚Äôs an anti-spasmodic and not an anti-diarrheal it would get rid of the cramps but leave the diarrhea.

how wrong i was! i took my first dose before my evening meal last night - after eating anything i usually get some pain/cramping and sometimes even flare ups. but i was absolutely fine. i had a poop not long after my tea and it was SO normal. like, normal i haven‚Äôt experienced since i was a kid.

i didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up too soon so just accepted it may have been a one off. woke up this morning, no pain, no urge to poop. took a dose before my lunch - i often skip lunch if i want to do something with my day as eating anything can trigger flare ups for me - and i was FINE. i had a coffee with my lunch, which is also sometimes a massive trigger for me - absolutely fine. there is NOTHING happening in there. no noises, no gurgles, no pain. just had my second poop on the meds and it was NORMAL.

i am honestly walking on air right now and hoping that it continues to work! this is the first time in my adult life where my insides have felt actually normal, and i didn‚Äôt realise just how normal your tummy was meant to feel!

I'm visiting Malaysia & Sumatra in the summer. Any tips on places for coffee/beans? 

For Malaysia I'll be between Kuala Lumpur and Georgetown (and a day of Malacca)

In Sumatra I'll visit Banda aceh/medan/Lake Toba and everything in between.


Would be nice to bring some back, although I don't know how much trouble airports will beüòÖ",0,1746634789.0,pourover,2,0.5,False
1kh1g9e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh1g9e,Week 19: Tempering - Chocolate Easter Eggs,"This week‚Äôs theme announcement was just in time for Easter, and in the UK we have a tradition of eating chocolate eggs (this probably exists in many other countries as well). I am often disappointed by the quality of these as it‚Äôs often really low-quality chocolate, so I‚Äôve been wanting to make my own Easter eggs for a while now. This theme was the perfect nudge. I decided to try my hand at tempering white, milk and dark chocolate, using [this guide](https://www.valrhona.com/en/l-ecole-valrhona/discover-l-ecole-valrhona/chocolate-terminology/tempering-chocolate). I then tested out a few flavour combinations using small chocolate egg moulds (clockwise from top left):

- Millionaire's Shortbread (milk chocolate egg filled with caramel and shortbread)
- Tiramisu (white chocolate egg filled with coffee dark chocolate ganache)
- Dubai Chocolate (milk chocolate egg filled with pistachio kataifi pastry)
- Speculoos (dark chocolate egg filled with speculoos cream)
- Strawberry Cheesecake (white chocolate egg filled with cheesecake, freeze dried strawberries and digestive biscuits)
- Black Forest Gateau (dark chocolate egg filled with cherry jam and white chocolate ganache)

I made all the fillings from scratch except the caramel (because last time I made caramel I had a bit of an accident‚Ä¶) and digestives and for the most part I freestyled the recipes. This was fine except my ratios were off for my white chocolate ganache and so the Black Forest gateau egg was not very structurally sound!

I only had one big chocolate egg mould and chose to make the Millionaire‚Äôs Shortbread in full size. I realised that I had been making my chocolate layers far too thick, so I did a slightly better job of this in the big egg. The only problem was that I made it so full of caramel and shortbread that I couldn‚Äôt join the two halves together. But it was delicious! [Here's a video of me breaking it](https://imgur.com/a/06qrGM6), I‚Äôm happy with the snap!

I found ARAMSE and Nguyen Coffee Supply on YouTube to have some great content around both.

I‚Äôve been following James Hoffmann for the longest time, and more recently, I started brewing with a V60. I‚Äôve found Lance Hedrick‚Äôs videos really intuitive and helpful during this learning curve.

On Instagram, I really like what Arjun Sethi and Kanishk are doing with their coffee content.

So, who are some creators you follow on YouTube, Instagram, X, Reddit, or elsewhere and can genuinely vouch for in terms of their contribution to the coffee community?",5,1746634707.0,IndiaCoffee,11,1.0,False
1kh1g0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kh1g0f/help_with_running_power_to_coffee_nook/,Help with running power to coffee nook,"
I‚Äôm looking at making some upgrades to my coffee nook and could use some help with how to go about it.

Two main goals are:

1.  Sconce
2.  Add outlet to power appliances, including electric kettle

The nook is up against a large cabinet where the other side of the cabinet wall is a fridge, which obviously has power.  Theres also an outlet near the base board about halfway down the wall.

I was planning to pull out the fridge and run power to the sconce from the outlet the fridge is plugged into with a switch near counter height. Seems straightforward enough and with an LED bulb I assume there‚Äôs no issue putting it on the same circuit as the fridge.

The outlet is the bigger challenge. One of the appliances is an electric kettle. I‚Äôve already noticed it heats noticeably slower plugged into a power strip, so I want to plug directly into an outlet.

But‚Ä¶ I assume I wouldn‚Äôt want to run the kettle on the same circuit as the fridge.

So should I pull power from the outlet that‚Äôs farther away half way down the wall? Potentially run it under the base board so I have a separate circuit? Should I run a better power strip from that outlet and just deal with the visual clutter? Or something else?",2,1746634703.0,HomeImprovement,1,0.76,False

The other day, while waiting in line at my local coffee shop, I noticed the person in front of me seemed a bit flustered. Without thinking much, I complimented their choice of scarf, mentioning how vibrant it looked. They smiled and thanked me, and we had a brief, pleasant chat.

Later, as I was leaving, they approached me and said that my comment had genuinely brightened their day, as they had been going through a tough time. It was a simple compliment, but it had a meaningful impact.

It just goes to show that even the smallest gestures, a kind word, a smile, a compliment, can make someone's day a little better. Let's keep spreading kindness in our everyday interactions!",23,1746634639.0,randomactsofkindness,3,1.0,False
