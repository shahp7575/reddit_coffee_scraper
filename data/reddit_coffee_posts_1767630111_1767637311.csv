And That’s the Point,"https://preview.redd.it/5xfd6wwxnkbg1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a393e259f1898361d1d689e94fd4363968bdb50

Pantone just announced its Colour of the Year for 2026, and it’s not neon, not bold, not Instagram-screaming for attention.

It’s **PANTONE 11-4201 'Cloud Dancer.'**

A soft, airy off-white.

At first glance, that might sound… underwhelming. But the more you look at it—especially through the lens of food, confectionery, and design—the more radical it feels.

This pick comes from the [Pantone Color Institute](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0), and it reads less like a trend forecast and more like a cultural mood check.

**Why choose  quiet now?**

We’re coming off years of:

• Hyper-saturated branding

• Loud packaging

• “More is more” product launches

• Social feeds engineered to overwhelm

Cloud Dancer feels like Pantone tapping the brakes.

Instead of demanding attention, it *creates space*.

Instead of spectacle, it signals restraint.

Instead of shouting indulgence, it whispers confidence.

That’s a big shift.

**What this means for food (especially confectionery)**

In confectionery and pastry, colour has traditionally done a lot of heavy lifting:

Bright = fun, indulgent, exciting.

Cloud Dancer flips that logic.

Rather than relying on colour, it pushes **texture, structure, and material quality** to the foreground.

Think:

• Mirror-smooth white chocolate glazes

• Rippled meringues catching light

• Aerated mousses and whipped ganaches

• Marshmallow, nougat, and soft milk-based confections

When everything isn’t fighting for attention, the *surface* becomes the design.

**White chocolate suddenly makes sense again**

White chocolate is probably the most natural embodiment of Cloud Dancer.

Its off-white tone matches the shade almost perfectly—and when used intentionally, it becomes a neutral canvas rather than an afterthought.

Against that softness, contrast becomes more meaningful:

Dark chocolate accents.

Toasted nuts.

Caramel flecks.

Coffee notes.

Nothing has to shout to be noticed.

There’s also a clean-label angle here. Many of these looks can be achieved without artificial colouring—just by working with naturally pale ingredients and good technique.

**Packaging that doesn’t yell**

Cloud Dancer isn’t just about what’s inside the box.

Off-white packaging, textured paper stocks, subtle embossing or debossing, minimal graphics—these choices communicate calm and quality in a way loud colours can’t.

On a shelf full of chaos, *restraint becomes contrast*.

It’s the design equivalent of lowering your voice so people lean in.

**The emotional layer: selling calm**

Pantone frames Cloud Dancer as a response to collective fatigue. And that’s where this colour choice gets interesting.

Confectionery doesn’t have to mean excess.

It can mean *pause*.

A small chocolate. A single pastry. A quiet indulgence instead of a dopamine bomb.

That narrative feels very 2026.

**Is this the future—or just a moment?**

Cloud Dancer won’t replace colour altogether. Bright, playful sweets aren’t going anywhere.

But it *does* suggest a shift in what “premium” and “innovative” might look like next:

Less noise.

More intention.

Quality over novelty.

In an industry obsessed with what’s next, Pantone’s message seems to be:

Sometimes the most forward-thinking move is knowing when to be quiet.

**Curious what others think:**

Do you see minimalism and restraint gaining ground in food and packaging—or will bold colours always win attention?

--
I found Gerard in the kitchen, perched atop the fridge like a gargoyle. Below him, three mason jars sat empty on the counter, licked perfectly clean. His pupils swallowed the room.

""Two weeks,"" I bargained, voice hoarse.

Gerard leapt down, dragging his nails across my wrist in one fluid motion. The cut welled up sluggishly. I was running low trying to keep up with his appetite by myself. He lapped at it with an air of disappointment.

Lacey’s laughter echoed in my skull, drowning out his purrs. She’d brought me a slice of pecan pie yesterday ""for your trouble"" and now I couldn’t stop picturing her fingers in the blood jars instead of mine. It was sick, it was distorted, but it was love.

New neighbors moved in on Wednesday. Their U-Haul blocked my driveway for three hours while they unloaded matching grey furniture and a yapping Chihuahua. Gerard flattened himself against the window, pupils blown wide. The dog turned, sniffed the air, and promptly pissed itself.

""Mierda,"" I smirked, watching the damp spot spread across their welcome mat. Gerard’s claws kneaded my shoulder in agreement. “Guessing you're not a fan of dogs, hm?” He chirped.

Lacey distracted me at work with her habit of twisting a strand of hair around her finger when counting tips and the way she absentmindedly hummed Kate Bush songs while refilling the ketchup bottles. I caught myself zombified by the coffee station just to watch the steam curl around her throat. Gerard sulked in the corners of my vision, but he went fuzzy whenever Lacey was in view. Her veins pulsed beautifully. 

By week five, my dreams turned viscous. Lacey’s skin peeled away in slow, perfect strips under my fingernails. I woke with my sheets damp, Gerard perched on my chest with an air of irritation. “Don't make me dream of her like that,” I whined, pulling my pillow over my head to go back to sleep.

The Chihuahua’s barks escalated to hourly symphonies. One midnight, I found Gerard crouched on the fence post, vibrating with barely-contained violence. The neighbor’s motion light caught his silhouette, elongated like a Halloween decotation. The dog whimpered once before bolting inside.

""You're not an outdoor cat,"" I whispered, dragging him back by the scruff. His growl reverberated through my ribcage. ""And I'm not killing a dog. Dogs are innocent, no matter how annoying. And we don't kill innocent, right?” 

Lacey pressed a napkin into my hand after my third coffee spill. ""You okay?"" Her thumb brushed my pulse point. “You look like hell.”

Gerard, invisible to her, sank his teeth into my calf. The pain was keeping me awake, as good sleep had abandoned me. “Sure,” I yawned. I went to mop up the spill with the napkin before realizing it wasn't for the mess. 

At home, I traced her number, inked onto said napkin, while Gerard paced the kitchen perimeter. His tail lashed against the freshly mopped linoleum. ""She smells like peaches,"" I mused aloud. Gerard swiped at my ankle, drawing beads of red. The message was clear: peaches weren't on the menu. 

I cleaned the house top to bottom before Lacey's first visit. She cooed over Gerard, who was acting sweeter than I had expected. Maybe this was his idea of a compromise. Be nice to Lacey in hopes of a fresh kill. He even let her share the bed.

Gerard's hunger manifested in ways that couldn't be as hidden, however. The way shadows clung to him unnaturally, how moths died mid-flight near his whiskers. Lacey laughed when one dropped into her sweet tea. ""Country living,"" she grimaced. “He's a creepy little guy, huh?” Gerard's purr rattled the glassware. He was playing nice for now with Lacey, but his irritation in me was growing. Apparently my blood just wasn't tasty enough.

I'll admit that my affection for Lacey possibly bordered on obsession. She was a final anchor to a ""normal"" life. I was constantly losing sleep and anemic and it definitely was affecting my psyche. I often wondered if Gerard was poisoning me with his bites, but really he had just hit peak frustration with me. He was reminding me who was in control, but my mind was torn between his needs and Lacey's soft touch.

Gerard’s unhappiness grew much more obvious. He hissed when Lacey texted, he scratched my phone screen when she called. He'd even begun stealing my shirts, specifically the ones Lacey complimented, and drowned them in his water bowl. Passive-aggressive bastard. But I couldn't help it. She was the only person who didn't look at me like I was a ticking time bomb. She was bliss.

The new neighbors' Chihuahua was another story. Its yapping pierced through my skull like a lobotomy. Every morning at 6 AM on the fucking dot, it launched into a frenzied performance the second the motion lights flicked on. Gerard took to sitting in the windowsill, vibrating with murderous intent, his tail twitching like a metronome counting down to Armageddon. 

Then the dreams worsened.

Not of blood or murder, but of Lacey dying *because* of me. In one, Gerard sprang from my arms mid-conversation, tearing out her throat before I could react. In another, she stumbled upon my basement blood jars and screamed, so I shoved her head into one, holding her under until the bubbles stopped. I'd wake gasping, sheets soaked in sweat, Gerard kneading my chest with claws extended, purring like a chainsaw.

The worst part? I wasn't horrified.

Just hungry.

One evening, Lacey came over with wine “to celebrate your stitches coming out!"", and Gerard seemingly *vanished*. Not just hiding, but *gone*. I panicked, yet the house felt lighter, the air easier to breathe. Lacey assured me he was just hiding somewhere, as cats were crafty. I decided to believe her.

We laughed. We drank. We kissed. And for three glorious hours, I forgot about blood and murder and hunger. 

When she left, Gerard came back, and the horrors of my actual reality set in. I mindlessly slid a razor blade across my stomach and laid down to let Gerard drink, but he seemed utterly unsatisfied.

I let out a heaving sigh. ""Ok, bud. You've done your best to be patient, haven't you? I guess our cooldown can be over now."" Gerard flicked his tail in annoyance, maybe he knew I'd only said it to pacify him. But tonight, Lacey wasn't here to distract me, and the neighbors' Chihuahua was yapping nonstop again, its shrill little barks drilling into my skull like rusty nails. Gerard's ears twitched with every yip, his pupils expanding until his eyes were black pits. It kept us both up, and the lack of sleep made Gerard irritable and me irrational.

By midnight, I gave in. Gerard leapt onto my chest, pressing his cold nose to mine, and suddenly, the hunger wasn't just his, it was mine. The realization hit me like a freight train: I didn't just kill for him anymore. I *wanted* to. The diner's fry cook, a greasy bastard who'd bragged about beating his ex-wife? Perfect. The high school PE coach with a collection of girls's missing socks? Even better. Gerard curled around my ankles as I sharpened my favorite fillet knife, his approving purrs vibrating through the floorboards.

We started local, the neighbor who'd whipped his own son when he thought no one was looking, but soon, we crossed county lines. The world narrowed to the sound of Gerard’s delighted chirps as I worked, the wet crunch of bone under my boot, the way his tongue swiped across his muzzle when I drained my victims with expert precision. Lacey texted me frantically, two sticking out the most: first a breakup, then a plea to ""get help."" I laughed, showed Gerard, then tossed my phone to the floor. The killing obsession pushed her from my mind.

The basement was overflowing with mason jars, and the news was buzzing with reports of a serial killer with a penchant for draining their victim's blood. Multiple counties were collaborating to bring the killer to justice, and yet by some divine will-- maybe Gerard's, I left no trail, no evidence. As I slashed the throats of rapists and pedophiles and every other level of scum of the earth, I felt on top of the world, my beloved kitty at my side. The police searching for me were clueless, and I reveled in their incompetence. 

Lacey's texts went unanswered, her calls ignored. She was concerned for me. I wasn't myself, or maybe I was more myself than ever. Gerard was all I needed, all I cared about. I was a mess at work, wide eyed and nonsensical and constantly saying unhinged things, but who cared? I felt alive.

Every night was a new hunt. Gerard and I would stalk our prey like phantoms in the dark. Sometimes we'd break into their homes, othertimes we'd lure them out. And as always, they were bad people.

The Pizza Hut manager who'd kicked his dog often. Gerard saw it. I slit his throat in the alley behind the restaurant, his blood pooling thick and warm in the moonlight. Gerard lapped at it eagerly, his purrs vibrating through my bones. ""Good kitty,"" I whispered, stroking his spine. The body was dumped in the river before dawn.

Next was the Walmart cashier, the one with the Polaroids hidden in his basement. Gerard hissed when we found them. I took my time with him, basing the speed of my kills on the crime. His screams were muffled by duct tape, and were quite annoying, but the way his eyes bulged when I peeled his skin back in strips was poetry. Gerard perched on his chest, watching with eerie fascination as I worked. By the time I finished, the man was barely recognizable. Gerard licked the blood from my fingers approvingly.

The news called me a monster. Forums called me a hero. I didn't care either way. The rush was all that mattered. The way my pulse synced with Gerard's purrs as we hunted, the way the world narrowed to nothing but blood and the thrill of the kill, it all gave me a sense of purpose. By week three, I stopped sleeping entirely. I probably should have been fired for all the mistakes I made at work, but I think they all felt sad for me. It was amusing, because little did they know I was better than ever.

Bart Tillman was my Mona Lisa. The “man” was a Sunday school teacher with a taste for boys. Gerard led me to his basement through a window left ajar, his tail twitching with anticipation. The man didn't even scream when I pressed the knife to his throat, didn't even plead. He just prayed. Gerard perched on his chest, eyes like polished obsidian, and I made sure Tillman watched as I peeled strips from his thighs like jerky, promising him that God had abandoned him for his disgusting life of sin and he had to deal with me now. His whimpers were sweeter than any confession. We left him sprawled across the cathedral stairs, a choir of flies singing his requiem.

The county sheriff held a press conference calling it ""the work of Satan."" I felt that was a little extreme. Gerard licked his claws clean as we watched it on my phone, making biscuits on my chest. We wore their blood like a badge of honor and celebrated with cheap champagne.

By week five, I stopped bothering with the theatrics, just quick slashes to the femoral artery, draining them into mason jars while Gerard supervised. Efficiency was key at this point, we had quotas to meet and I was growing so tired. Lacey’s texts piled up unanswered (""Are you okay?"" ""This isn’t funny."" ""Please.""). When she showed up at my door in tears, I barely recognized her. She still smelled like peach shampoo, but for some reason, it no longer intoxicated me.

""You're not you,"" she whispered. I grinned, tasting copper. The knife was still warm in my pocket. Gerard’s tail flickered against my ankkle. “Why are you smiling?”

“Nervous habit,” I replied, trying to give her a kiss. But she refused. 

“We're done until you're….better.”

But this *was* better.

By month three, we'd perfected the rhythm: stalk during graveyard shifts, strike where cameras glitched (always near Gerard), leave not a single drop of blood. They called me “The Bleeding Heart Killer”. 

Lacey's final text: ""I'm scared of you"", barely registered as I wiped blood from my phone screen. Gerard purred against my collarbone, his soft tail curling possessively around my wrist. The sheriff's task force held press conferences begging for tips. The news had never been so entertaining, and it only got better as we decided to slip into Missouri. Crossing state lines, the big time!

The first Missouri kill was almost too easy: a pediatrician with a hard drive full of horrors, his security system conveniently disabled by what the cops called ""an electrical anomaly."" To commemorate, I took my time with him, working like a psychopathic surgeon. By dawn, the “good” doctor's tongue was stapled to his clinic's welcome sign. Local moms brought casseroles, seemed like the only thing Midwestern moms could make, to the grieving receptionist while their kids played hopscotch over spots that had bloodstains the night before.

By kill number twelve, a dog breeder who happened to have his wife's corpse in his backyard, I'd perfected the art of it all. Gerard liked presenting me with their severed pinky toes like gruesome little beans, his own trophies. We'd play fetch with them in abandoned parking lots, his eyes glowing like cigarette embers in the dark as he batted the weeping digits across the asphalt. Sometimes I'd wake with a toe under my pillow, a morbid treat from Gerard.

Forums grew divided. Reddit threads analyzed my ""pattern"" (there wasn't one) while Facebook groups posted candlelit vigils for my victims' families.

When the St. Louis PD connected my Arkansas kills to the new Missouri atrocities, Gerard celebrated by shredding their flyers to confetti. We watched the coverage curled together on hotel room beds, his claws kneading my thigh as a stern sheriff promised justice. The ticker at the bottom of the screen read ""Satanic motives? Multiple killers?” Gerard's purrs hummed in the background.

Our methods soon evolved. Less theatrics, more volume. I'd park outside AA meetings and follow the drunk fathers home, the ones who smelled less like Budweiser and more like belt leather. Gerard would slink ahead, disabling porch lights with a twitch of his whiskers. By the time I reached their bedrooms, they'd already be paralyzed, and I explained, between arterial sprays, exactly which child's bruises had condemned them to such fury. 

The local subreddit devised drinking games for my crime scenes. Podcasters debated whether I was ""vigilante” or a maniac. Meanwhile, Gerard and I turned I-44 into our personal playground. So many characters to collect: a Baptist deacon drowned in baptismal font (his hard drive contained three terabytes of toddlers), a rodeo clown flayed with his own spurs (his son was literally starving to death), a waitress filleted like a fish (she gleefully pushed a boyfriend to suicide). We'd nap in my copper scented truck, his purrs vibrating through my ribs as I dreamt of faces dissolving in acid and fingernails being freed from their flesh.

By the time we hit Springfield, even Gerard seemed satiated. He'd nap for hours between kills, his belly distended with stolen blood, while I developed a tremor in my knife hand. The dreams worsened again, not of victims, but of *customers* at the diner, their necks blooming open like grotesque flowers as I refilled their coffee. There was no more pleasure in them, only guilt and pain. When I woke screaming, Gerard would press his cold nose to my eyelids until the visions settled into something resembling peace. The last text from Lacey, “Where are you?”, still glowed on my lock screen when I poured gasoline over the phone and ignited it. Too distracting. His eyes reflected the flames as I whispered, ""Who's next?""

The answer came via AMBER Alert I saw on TV: a five-year-old girl snatched from her swing set, her backpack found discarded near a known predator's trailer. When the news reported the suspect's employer, a pet store chain, Gerard's purr shook the foundation. We left before dawn, the cleaver tucked under my seat beside a mason jar labeled ""Fresh Brew."" The sunrise painted the highway deep blood orange. The perfect mood.

At the storage unit where he'd stashed her, the man begged through his choking sobs. Gerard sat perched on a stack of dog food bags, pupils swallowing the scene with satisfaction before he jumped away to let me finish. The cleaver made a wet slapping sound with each swing. Right hand, left foot, left hand, right foot, tongue, done. I bottled his screams in jar #48. The girl slept through it all, curled in a nest of shredded Purina bags, Gerard's tail draped over her like a sentinel. When the cops found her unharmed twelve hours later, she'd whisper about ""the nice shadow kitty"" that kept her safe.

Two states away, my face flashed across a hotel room TV, but not on *America's Most Wanted*. No, it was sandwiched between lost dogs and senior citizen bingo nights. LOCAL MAN MISSING, read the slide. “Live from Mercy's End, Arkansas,” the reporter stated. I sat up.

Lacey's voice soon cracked through cheap speakers: ""He just stopped answering. It's not like him."" The camera zoomed in on her bitten nails, the tremor in her hands as she clutched my ratty Black Sabbath shirt I'd let her sleep in. Gerard growled at the screen, still not liking how she stole my attention it seemed. I didn't realize I was crying until hot salt hit my split knuckles.

""Fuck,"" I whispered. An abusive fry cook's blood was still tacky under my nails. Gerard's tail lashed against my shin, as if to say *focus*. But all I could see was Lacey's chipped blue nail polish, the same shade she'd worn painting my toenails that one drunken night. Gerard leapt onto my chest, pressing his cold nose to my tear ducts. It wasn't animosity. It was mercy. Sure he was a bloodthirsty demon, but he was also *my* kitty. He loved me. And I doubt he liked seeing me cry.

The motel TV buzzed with age, my face pixelated under MISSING PERSON in chunky white letters. Gerard batted at the screen as Lacey's voice broke: ""He wouldn't just *leave*, would he?"" The tremble in her words stung worse than Gerard's claws. “Vee if you can see this, just come home please.”

Gerard nudged my palm. *What now?*

""We go home,"" I said, sniffing. His ears pricked. ""Not to kill, just to...fix this.""

Gerard exhaled through his nose—disapproving, but resigned.

The drive back was quiet. Just me, my cat, and the growing ache in my stomach. When the storm hit, it was almost funny. Was God sighing ""*Really?*"" as the sky split open? As we turned onto Maple Street, we skidded. I could see my house, so close, my storm cellar, but the winds were approaching triple digit speeds. 

It whipped my shitty truck into the neighbor's yard, tipping it sideways. In a panic, I looked for a storm cellar in their yard. Surely my neighbors weren't so heartless that they'd deny a young man and his cat shelter from the storm? The lightning panicked Gerard as I made a break for the door, and he took off, me after him. We were like ghosts in the night, hard to see in the dark. That I understood. What I didn't was what came next.

A gunshot rang out from behind us. Gerard's paws slipped out from under him. He fell limp to the ground in the mud.

""No!"" I whipped around, the thunder muffling my scream. The neighbor stood frozen in his doorway, gun still smoking. His wife shrieked. Blood pulsed from Gerard's chest. His golden eyes met mine, full of loyalty, before they dulled. The life was gone. 

I launched myself at the neighbor before I knew what I was doing. My hands found his throat as we crashed into the porch railing. The storm drowned out his wheezing.

Another gunshot.

Pain exploded in my side. I stumbled back, clutching my ribs. Blood seeped through my fingers. The neighbor's wife screamed louder and shoved her husband aside. ""You idiot!"" she yelled. She grabbed me by the arm and dragged me toward their storm cellar.

Inside, the world was damp concrete and the smell of mildew. The neighbor’s hands shook as his wife pressed a towel to my wound. ""He's just a kid!"" she snapped. ""And you shot his damn cat!"" The neighbor stammered something about rabies, about Gerard’s unnatural size, how he looked like a raccoon, but his wife wasn’t having it. She poured whiskey over my side, it was agonizing, and then wrapped me tight. Outside, the storm howled like Gerard used to when he was hungry. I was dizzy, shaking, and crying for him. 

Police arrived as the storm began to settle, flashlights cutting through the downpour.  I sat slumped against a shelf of pickled beets, half-delirious, whispering, ""I killed them all."" The sheriff told me I was just in shock, delirious with blood loss. Neighbors flooded the lawn, many of them telling sheriffs that I was that missing guy, and it wasn't long before someone told Lacey. Less than ten minutes later, she whipped in the driveway, relieved it was actually me. But they were all years away to me as I madly confessed my sins. One deputy wrote it down, laughing, ""I'll have what he's having,"" while the EMTs loaded me onto a gurney, their latex gloves snapping against my skin like the sound of tendons separating. The neighbor's wife clutched her pearls, whispering to Lacey, ""His poor cat...""

Gerard couldn't have been just a cat. He must have been some spirit, some god, pulling strings post mortem. This was the only conclusion my unwell mind could come to because how, *how* was I not being arrested? The confession tape would've been comedic gold, me sobbing about severed pinky toes and baptismal drownings in the name of feeding my cat while Sheriff Dawes kept sighing and rubbing his temples like I was reciting bad fanfiction. The EMTs strapped me to the gurney with the same bored efficiency as Lacey wrapping silverware at the diner.

Lacey visited me in the hospital smelling like stale coffee and cheap cigarettes. She held my hand while the doctor explained my ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" diagnosis, her fingers trembling against mine. The neighbor's wife brought me a casserole. *A casserole.* As if grief over shooting my demon cat was equivalent to her husband's prostate surgery last spring. I wanted to spit on her, but Lacey kept me calm. 

The meds made everything feel underwater, but the ache in my side where the bullet had grazed me was viciously present. It felt like a grim reminder that Gerard wasn't here to lick the wound clean.

They released me into Lacey's care, seems any and all of my family was states away, with a prescription and stern warnings about ""avoiding stressors."" Lacey's apartment smelled like Febreze and unwashed laundry, her couch sagging under the weight of my hollowed-out body. She cried when she thought I was asleep, whispering to her sister on the phone, *""He keeps asking for the cat, Mel. Like it was his fucking kid. Like it's the only family he had.""* The pills turned my dreams into grainy VHS static, but sometimes I'd jerk awake convinced I felt Gerard's weight on my chest, his phantom purr vibrating through my ribs. 

“You really liked that cat more than most people,” Lacey mused as she helped me back home. 

“All people,” I replied. “But uh, I am sorry for what I put ya through. Friends?”

Her lips pursed. “Take some time to stabilize first, please. Then we can talk about being friends.” I felt cold as she left.

The town treated me like a kicked puppy. Reverend Cole brought a casserole. Margaret left blackout curtains on my porch ""for the migraines."" As well as a casserole. I was so fucking sick of casserole.

Even Sheriff Dawes nodded at me in the Walmart like we were drinking buddies instead of predator and prey. The only thing sharper than the pain in my side was my disdain for him.

After some time, Lacey moved in ""temporarily"". She wanted to see how I was doing, and entertained giving us another chance. Her toothbrush sat next to mine, her Van Halen tapes replaced my scratched-up horror soundtracks. She'd watch me swallow the little white pills with the intensity of a prison guard, freshly painted nails tapping at the countertop impatiently, as I was reluctant. At night, I'd dream of mason jars shattering against tile, and gallons of blood swirling down the drain while Gerard's shadow paced the ceiling, his howls echoing in the night. I'd awake with tears in my eyes. 

Then came the scratching under the porch.

I was sitting in the kitchen, staring at the ring of dried blood on the floorboards where Gerard’s favorite water bowl used to be, when I heard it. Tiny claws dragging across rotted wood. The sound drilled straight through my skull. The neighbor’s wife had just dropped off another casserole (chicken this time, crust browned like old scabs) and I’d been counting the seconds until I could dump it in the trash, waiting till she was safe in her home. The noise pressed on like *The Raven*, and it wasn’t the wind. It was deliberate. Hungry.

I crawled onto the porch, belly wound pulsing, and pressed my face to the lattice. The gap beneath the house was black as a pupil. Then two pinpricks of gold flared in the light I flashed. A kitten, small enough to cup in my palms, staggered about. Its fur was patchy, half-black and half-white like a bad photocopy of Gerard. But the eyes. Christ, the eyes were identical. Pupils blown wide, bottomless, the same twitching hunger that used to watch me sharpen knives with glee at 3 AM.

It mewed, nay, howled. The sound hit me like a gut punch.

“Gerard…?” My voice cracked. The kitten blinked slowly, the way Gerard always did when I told him what a good kitty he was. 

I reached out. It sniffed my fingers, then sank needle teeth into my thumb. Blood welled up, glistening. The kitten lapped at it with a sandpaper tongue, purring like a chainsaw. It was nostalgic. “Vampire kitty,” I murmured. 

The stitches in my side pulled taut as I yanked the lattice free and crawled under the porch to retrieve the little guy.

Behind me, Lacey’s car door slammed. “Vee? What’re you doi– oh.” She froze at the porch steps, grocery bags dangling. I was covered in cobwebs and dirt, the little cat safe in my arms. Her face softened.

Heyoo Reddit 👋✨

So I figured I’d give this a shot because why not? Life’s way more fun when you’ve got cool people to chat with, right? 🥳 I’m basically on the lookout for someone  to laugh with, share random memes 🐸📸, rant about daily chaos 😅, and maybe even discover some common hobbies (or weird ones 👀).

About me:
	•	Certified introvert who sometimes pretends to be social 🦥
	•	Coffee addict ☕ + night owl 🌙 = questionable sleep schedule 🛌
	•	Love cooking 🍳, baking 🍪, and pretending my food looks like Pinterest pictures (spoiler: it does not 😂)
	•	Huge fan of long walks, especially when I can pretend I’m the main character in some dramatic indie film 🎶🌲
	•	Low-key gym rat 💪 but also 100% down for pizza at midnight 🍕✨

What I’m hoping for:
	•	Chill convos about literally anything 🛸
	•	Swapping music recs 🎧
	•	Gaming buddies? (I’m not great but I try 😅🎮)
	•	People who don’t mind my occasional “life update” voice notes that sound like podcast episodes 🎙️

If you’re the type of person who sends way too many emojis 🙋‍♀️, loves random deep talks at 2 AM 🌌, or just wants a new pal to share memes with… hit me up! 💌

Anyway, if you’ve made it this far, congrats 🏆 you now know more about me than half the people in my real life 😂 Let’s be friends? 💜",1,1767636952.0,MakeFriendsOver30,2,1.0,False

1q4tb08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4tb08,"5th January 2026 — A Slow Day, A New Habit","Today started quite late—I woke up around 11:30 AM. Yesterday I wasn’t feeling well, which is why I couldn’t post my daily journal, track my fitness calories, or record my expenses.
After waking up, I applied moisturizer and then took a bath. Post-bath, I spent some time meditating, which helped me feel a bit more settled. Following that, I had brunch and then sat down at my table to start some work.
To be honest, today was not productive at all. I tried to get things done, but I couldn’t focus properly and didn’t make much progress. I’m not entirely sure why—it just felt like one of those low-energy days. After some time, I took a break and had sweet potato with oats.
One of the most important and positive parts of the day was that I started playing the ukulele. I played for around 1.5 hours and even learned a song. This felt really good, and I’m confident I’ll turn this into a consistent habit and improve over time.
Later, it was time to work out, so I stepped out. Before heading to the park, I had some pani puri. After returning home, I had a cup of coffee and sat down again to work on my next video script.
As dinner time approached, I started watching the Succession series again. It really motivates me—the politics, power dynamics, and ambition in the show make me want to build something big myself. After that, I had dinner.
Now I’m in bed, writing this journal. I’ll read a bit and then go to sleep because tomorrow is college.

My recent coffee beers have a great coffee flavor from steeping whole beans in the brite before kegging.  First week or two after kegging tastes great, then the coffee flavor intensity kinda drops out. The coffee is still there, but just not what it was 2 weeks before.  
I brew hazies here with no oxidation problems, so I'm not sure it's oxidation, but I can't think of what else it would be.

1q4t98k,https://www.reddit.com/r/palaceresorts/comments/1q4t98k/experience_with_moon_palace_sunrise_cancun/,Experience with Moon Palace Sunrise Cancun,"We are in Moon Palace Sunrise now. We are checking out today. Here is our experience: 

Good:
1. App system / Tech aspect is good
2. Coffee shop which includes hot beverages, sweets, icecream, sandwiches open for a long time and has good crepe station. Crepes in particular were excellent
3. At this time of the year beach was nice with little to no sea grass on the sand.
4. Weather was good most of our stay, except for one cold rainy day.
5. Some restaurants food was really good. 
6. Transportation between resorts using golf cart and buses were good. Not much waiting needed.
7. Room service like towels, cleaning request, food delivery from their room service menu was good. However I think one day they accidentally cleaned out and took away my toilette case. I never got it back.
8. Pools were decently clean. 

Bad:
1. 
a. Sunrise rooms is small, bathroom is tiny, room has a weird smell. (I don’t think Grand has this issue.)
b. While booking we asked for roll away bed, because room had two double bed. But we never got one in our entire stay. We are 3 people and two adults in one twin bed was too difficult to sleep in. They have no rooms with queen beds. Even if we had booked king bed room, we would not have gotten roll away bed and ended up sleeping 3 adults in one king bed. Definitely not comfortable for 3 or 4 adults with two double beds. 
2. Restaurant reservations through app has restrictions. You can reserve only when you checkin and on checkin day most reservations will be out. We arrived around 6 PM and luckily we got one spot in Trattoria at 10:30 pm. Nothing else was available. We got seated pretty late but the waiter and food was awesome in this restaurant.
3. Restaurants reservations open in app at 7 am local time everyday of your stay and you get to reserve only for 48 hours (today, tomorrow and the day after). This is quite restrictive and restaurants get booked out pretty quickly. Every day 7 am you should do this work to get the restaurant for the second or third day. If you snooze you lose.. For all inclusive concept this defies the purpose of relaxed vacation. 
4. While app system is good, it does not cover edge cases like: 2 of us wanted to eat in Trattoria and 1 of us in Agra for the same night dinner (1 of us has dietary restrictions). App does not allow these type of cases. 
5. Due to season, the restaurants were pretty full, so we could not get table if we walked in. They literally didn’t take any walkins (we are not members, members experience might be different)
6. Dec 31st dinner was set menu in all restaurants. We checked in on 30th and we could not get any reservations for 31st dinner. We tried to reserve as soon as we checked in (this is when app reservations open up for you) and literally no restaurant had a table available for us. We ended up eating in some restaurant in Nizuc, because they had 2 meals left. The meal was pretty bad, lobster was fancy looking but pretty bad lobster meat. Dessert and salad was not good. Dec 31st was the most expensive rate in our entire stay and the food was pretty bad for that rate.
7. Most other days we got reservations only pretty late in the night like 10/10:30 pm 
8. Resort credits is too restrictive and a scam. I will give more details in next section. 

Ugly:
1. Too much pressure for timeshare/membership.
We did goto this presentation to get one day pass for grand. They said it’s a 90 min presentation but we lost half a day in this. To and from transportation to grand, grand elite room tour, they start presentation only after we finish our breakfast at circus in grand etc., All of this adds up to 4-5 hours of your day. We were asked to come at 8:30 am to lobby and we came back to Sunrise lobby around 12 PM. We missed one of the classes we planned due to this mis information of 90 min presentation.
2. We mainly wanted 1 day grand pass for food in grand and water park. We were ok with spending 2 hours to get this, but they had 4-5 levels of managers trying to sell their time share(they call it membership). 
3. While grand rooms, lobby, restaurants were good, at every point the resort management was trying to show how it differentiates between elite members and regular folks who stay in sunrise or nizuc. Grand gym, common bathrooms, grand rooms were all better but it was like rubbing it on you while you booked sunrise/nizuc which has rooms/facilities not on par with grand. 
4. Even during our checkout time they tried to sell the final 299$ scam which would allow your next time booking with them to be cheaper.
5. While booking your resort and by attending their membership presentation you get resort credits. But this is a total scam. They have restrictive items you can buy in shops, spa massages are covered, some tours are covered but you need to pay for their transportation/taxes/service charges 
If you buy items from shop, they have very few items covered in this, you need to pay 16% tax and price of items is jacked up like anything. So what we end up doing is we actually pay the tax which would be the actual cost of the item. I did end up falling for this scam, bought a hat which costed 18$ in tax. I would have gotten same hat for 20$ in US. For spa, you get massages, hair cut/trim/highlighting, manicure/pedicure etc., For these you need to pay service charge. Example cost of my massage was 398$, service charge was something like 48$. While this is the best option for using credits overall, you would still pay service charge and tips for masseuse. The same type of massage is cheaper in my city but I can’t get it for 55$. I read in Reddit spa and golf was the best option for using resort credits. 
6. Resort credit that you got while booking should be activated. Activation takes 24 hours and this needs to be done at guest services after you checkin. On the day of checkin guest services was only trying to sell us the membership presentation and never mentioned this activation of resort credits that we got while booking. Because of this we were unaware of this activation process and we assumed it will be there in our account. Last before day when we checked for booking spa we came to know we had no credit activated in our account. On checkout day we argued and tried to get the resort credit activated but there was no spa appointment we could get. Since I already bought a gift shop item and got scammed, i didn’t want to buy any item. We wanted golf or spa but due to this last min activation we couldn’t do either. We had to forgo the resort credit we got during booking of the resort. 
7. Day pass to grand - water park was not too big or worth it for day pass. For young kids water park might be a hit. Restaurants were good. Gym was good. Common restrooms were clean and better in grand. Pools are similar in all three resorts. You don’t need a day pass for using pools I think. Because you can walk in the beach and goto all 3 resorts pools and I don’t think anybody checks in pools about the resort you are staying in. Also in water park nobody scanned our room number or day pass. Only for booking restaurant reservations this day pass mattered. Rest of the grand we were not asked to show our day pass band or room number. You need to decide if half day of your vacation is worth a day spent in Grand. For us food was good, waterpark and pools were not worth it. 
8. Overall resort system is money minded. Everything is app based or call center based. It was stressful for restaurant reservations, tours reservations, resort credits use without getting too much charged in the name of taxes/service charge. Classes/activities which are free gets crowded, gym classes are held in very small space and you need to time it with your breakfast/lunch/dinner along with transportation/walking time. We ended up walking a lot!!

Restaurants Rating:
1. Trattoria (Italian, awesome food and service)
2. Habibi (grand , so you need day pass or stay in grand). Lebanese food. Food was great
3. Los Tacos (grand. walk in lunch. Small portions but good quality and taste)
4. Pepe Pizza - good pizza. Plus pool side had some options for fries, drinks, burgers. This was good
5. Grand Breakfast buffet (lot of options, omlette station was great)
6. Gandola Breakfast Buffet (lot of options)
7. Los Caproles (only one of us had breakfast and it was well liked for that dish)
8. Momo Teppanyaki (not the regular Momo. They had two Momo restaurants in the app and we got reservations only for Teppanyaki). Show was good but food was not good 
9. Riveryara Maya ( vegetarian was decent, meat options not good)
10. Agra (we are Indians so we won’t qualify this food as good)
11. Dec 31st set menu for dinner was worst. Everything was rubbery and over cooked.

When I do laundry I find the jackets you leave behind and shirts that aren’t mine, but they end up in my closet anyway. It’s become a habit of mine to leave the right side of my bed vacant.

1q4t7n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q4t7n1/im_a_nightshift_janitor_at_a_prestigious/,I’m a night-shift janitor at a prestigious university. There’s a door in the basement that only appears when the floor is wet.,"I’ve worked the graveyard shift at St. Jude’s University for six years. Most people think being a janitor is about scrubbing floors and emptying trash, but at a place this old, it’s mostly about knowing which sounds to ignore. The steam pipes hiss like they’re whispering secrets, and the old floorboards groan under ghosts of students long gone. I like the quiet. Or, I used to.

My route covers the Life Sciences building. It’s a labyrinth of linoleum and fluorescent lights that buzz with a headache-inducing hum. The basement is the worst part—a maze of storage rooms and heavy, lead-lined doors. My supervisor, a grizzled guy named Artie who’s been here since the seventies, gave me one specific instruction when I started: ""If you’re mopping the North Hallway and you see a door without a room number, keep mopping. Don't look at it, and for God’s sake, don't walk through it.""

For six years, I followed that rule. I’d mop the North Hallway, see the faint outline of a heavy oak door appearing in the reflection of the wet floor, and I’d look at my boots until the tiles dried and the door vanished. But last night, the pipes in the ceiling burst.

The North Hallway was flooded. I was standing in three inches of water, the reflection so clear it was like looking into a mirror. And there it was. The door. It wasn't just a faint outline anymore; it was solid, dark wood with a brass handle that looked like a screaming face. The smell hit me then—not the smell of old paper or chemical cleaners, but the scent of ozone and wet earth.

I should have walked away. I should have called Artie. But the door was slightly ajar, and I could hear a sound coming from inside. It was a rhythmic thump-thump, like a heartbeat slowed down to a crawl. Against every instinct I had, I pushed the door open.

The room inside shouldn't have fit within the building’s foundations. It was a vast, circular chamber lined with thousands of glass jars. I stepped inside, the water from the hallway following me like it was alive. Each jar contained something pulsing—grey, brain-like masses connected by thin, copper wires. They weren't just sitting there; they were communicating. The wires hummed with a low frequency that made my teeth ache.

In the center of the room was a desk. Sitting there was a man wearing a janitor’s uniform exactly like mine. His back was to me.

""Artie?"" I whispered.

The figure didn't turn. ""The floors have to stay wet,"" the voice said. It sounded like Artie, but hollow, as if the words were being played through an old, broken speaker. ""The moisture conducts the memory. Without the water, the jars go dry. And when they go dry, the university forgets.""

I moved closer, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""Forgets what?""

The man finally turned around. It wasn't Artie. It wasn't anyone. It was a hollow shell made of the same grey mass I saw in the jars, shaped into the likeness of a man. It had no eyes, just deep sockets filled with that pulsing copper wire.

""It forgets us,"" the thing said. It reached out a hand, its fingers elongating like melting wax. ""We are the maintenance. We are the ones who keep the history from evaporating. Every student who fails, every professor who disappears... they end up in the jars. Their thoughts keep the lights on upstairs.""

I backed away, stumbling into the water. The door started to creak shut. The thing at the desk stood up, its movements jerky and unnatural. It wasn't trying to attack me; it was trying to hand me a mop.

""Your shift isn't over,"" it hissed. ""The North Hallway is drying. If it dries, you’ll be the next one in a jar.""

I bolted. I dived through the closing door and landed hard on the wet linoleum of the hallway. I didn't stop running until I reached the security office. I told them there was a flood, a break-in, anything to get them down there.

When we returned, the hallway was bone-dry. The burst pipe was sealed as if it had never leaked. And the door? It was gone. Not even a mark on the wall.

Artie was there, leaning against his cart, sipping coffee. He looked at me, his eyes cold and knowing. He didn't say a word. He just handed me a bucket and pointed back toward the North Hallway.

I’m writing this from the breakroom. I have three hours left on my shift. My hands won't stop shaking, and my teeth still ache from that humming sound. But the worst part is looking down at my own reflection in the bucket of soapy water.

Just for a second, I didn't see my eyes. I saw copper wires.

The floor is starting to dry. I have to go back. I have to keep it wet",2,1767636680.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

My ex girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me just over 8 weeks ago, and I would consider her an avoidant person. There was no argument, loss of love/attraction/desire and she openly expressed regret during the conversation! It’s was because she couldn’t see a future of us together anymore, but I think it was a typical anxious-avoidant trap

About 3 weeks after the break up, she sent me a lovely warm congratulations message after I ran my first marathon, only to pull back right away after. 

I caved on week 5 and invited her for a coffee, and she said she thought we shouldn’t meet up because it’s still early from the break up. Since then, she’s taken down posts on instagram of us and put them back up a few days later, and seemingly been stalking my profile. 

Honestly, I don’t think I could be handling the break up better. I’ve traveled to Italy, ran a marathon, my business has grown, I never begged, cried or pleaded, I’ve only spoke highly about her and I’ve given her space. My issue at the minute is I’m really starting to worry she’ll not reach out again. I want to make this work out, but I feel like I’m in the time frame where something should start happening.

1q4t6vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pune/comments/1q4t6vu/approached_a_stranger_at_a_cafe/,Approached a stranger at a cafe..,"Yesterday, I was roaming around FC Road with a friend when I noticed a girl sitting alone in a café. She was working on her laptop with a cup of coffee beside her. I casually told my friend that she looked cute and asked whether I should approach her and start a conversation. He encouraged me, and that’s when I realized..this was going to be my first cold approach.

(Also, my phone battery was at 2%, so I had a practical excuse to ask her for a charger 😅)

I went up to her and asked if I could sit there if she didn’t mind. She said yes. We started talking, and I asked whether she had come alone. She told me she was studying humanities and was working on an assignment that she needed to submit the next day. She seemed calm, polite, and genuinely pleasant to talk to.

We spoke about her background and studies, and I kept the conversation light with some wit and a genuine compliment. I asked about her plans, and she mentioned that although she’s from Mumbai, she really likes the vibe and people in Pune. The conversation flowed naturally, and it felt nice, easy and comfortable.

I asked her name but didn’t ask for her Instagram or phone number at first. Honestly, that wasn’t my motive. My goal was simply to have a conversation and get comfortable talking to someone I didn’t know, something I usually find difficult.

When I went back to my friend and told him about the conversation, he asked, “Did you get her number or Instagram?” That’s when I went back and asked her for her number. She asked for mine in return and saved it in her phone.

I thought we might talk later, but she never reached out and that’s completely fine. The purpose of the approach was never about getting her number. It was about stepping out of my comfort zone and having a genuine conversation.

Overall, it was a great experience. At first, my breathing was fast and I was nervous, but after a few minutes, I felt comfortable. What I’ve realized is that moments like these really boost your confidence. I had always thought approaching someone would be extremely difficult, but it also depends on the other person as well bcoz it's common in western culture but not in India. She was polite, genuine, and open, which made the interaction smooth,even though she was busy with her assignment.

What I learned is this: approach someone if you like them, accept rejection as a possibility, stay polite, don’t tie yourself to the outcome, and be genuinely curious",1,1767636634.0,pune,3,0.6,False
1q4t6v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1q4t6v3/your_life_changed_when_you_relied_less_on/,"**Your life changed when you relied less on motivation, and more on discipline: the real glow-up no one talks about**","Let’s be honest. Most of us aren’t lazy, we’re just tired of chasing that elusive thing called “motivation.” You know, waiting around till you magically feel like going to the gym, writing that paper, fixing your resume, or cleaning your disaster of an apartment. And if your algorithm looks anything like mine, TikTok and IG are flooded with influencers yelling “Just manifest it!” or “If you wanted it bad enough, you’d do it.”  

That’s not just wrong. It’s dangerous.  

As someone who studied psychology and behavioral science at Harvard, I can confidently say this: motivation is a mood. Discipline is a system.  

We’ve been set up to believe that change and improvement require feeling inspired first. But the science says otherwise. In fact, the most successful people build their lives around systems, habits, and consistency, not fleeting emotion.  

Here’s the no BS guide that helped me and many others break the toxic motivation loop, and it’s all backed by real research, not just some dude in a hoodie screaming at his phone.

---

**Useful mindset shifts to break up with motivation addiction:**

- **Action creates emotion, not the other way around.** Behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg found in his Stanford research that “tiny habits” lead to long-term transformation. Waiting to feel inspired before taking action is backwards. Start small, then momentum builds motivation.

- **Discipline is a muscle, not a personality trait.** Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford) explains on his podcast that willpower is trainable. Cold exposure, delayed gratification, and specific routines literally rewire the prefrontal cortex, your brain's control center.

- **You don’t need to feel like it. You just need to do it.** That’s not toxic hustle culture. That’s how habits get automated. According to James Clear’s bestseller *Atomic Habits*, the key to long-term behavior change is identity-based habits. You act like the person you want to become, before you feel like them.

---

**Actual tools that make discipline easier (not harder):**

- **Use implementation intentions.** Instead of ""I’ll work out tomorrow,"" say: ""After I drink my morning coffee at 8am, I’ll do 20 minutes of bodyweight exercises."" This hack from Dr. Peter Gollwitzer’s psychology research boosts follow-through by up to 91%.

- **Habit stacking.** Pair a new habit with an existing one. Example: right after brushing teeth, do 2 minutes of journaling. It’s from *Atomic Habits* and helps anchor your routines.

- **Track streaks, not time.** Apps like Streaks, Finch, or even a calendar with red Xs (like Jerry Seinfeld used) reinforce consistency. You want to make breaking the streak feel harder than sticking to it.

- **Design friction.** Put your phone in another room before bed. Lay out gym clothes the night before. Environment > willpower. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely found that most decision-making is shaped by context, not intention.

---

**Best books that made me rethink everything about motivation and discipline:**

- **""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield**  
  This cult classic is short, punchy, and brutal. It slaps down every excuse you’ve ever had. Pressfield calls procrastination “Resistance” and treats it like a living enemy. It’s the best book I’ve ever read on creative discipline. You’ll finish it ready to destroy your inner laziness.

- **""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport**  
  A Wall Street Journal bestseller by a Georgetown professor. This book changed how I think about attention. Newport argues that focus is a rare and valuable skill most people have lost. He backs it with research and gives a full system for getting into flow. If you’ve ever felt foggy, distracted, or like your brain is fried, this is your reset button.

- **""Can’t Hurt Me"" by David Goggins**  
  Not your typical self-help read. Goggins is a former Navy SEAL who went from obese to elite athlete. He’s extreme, but the message is real: discipline builds a bulletproof mind. This book will make you uncomfortable in the best way possible. You’ll walk away feeling like you’ve been lied to about your limits.

---

**Free and low-lift apps that help you build discipline (and actually stick to it):**

- **BeFreed**  
  This one’s next level. It’s an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It takes books, podcasts, expert research, and real-world success stories and turns them into a podcast-style learning plan based on your interests. It’s perfect for people working on self-discipline, habit building, or mental strength. You even get to pick your host’s voice and mood, I picked a dry, sarcastic one that feels like a no-nonsense coach. It adapts to what you listen to and builds a learning plan over time. It also covers all the books I mentioned above in its massive audio library. Great if you want science-backed knowledge without doomscrolling for hours.

- **Insight Timer**  
  Guided meditations, focus music, and time tracking. It’s not just woo-woo stuff. They have meditations specifically for building consistency and reducing procrastination. Also great for winding down without screen time.

- **Finch**  
  This is for people who need a cute dopamine hit. It gamifies self-care with a digital pet that grows as you check off goals and routines. Surprisingly effective if you’re motivated by visuals and small wins.

---

**Podcasts and YouTubes that go way deeper than “just hustle harder”:**

- **The Huberman Lab Podcast**  
  Dr. Andrew Huberman shares neuroscience-backed tips for increasing motivation, managing dopamine, and rewiring habits. It’s long-form but worth it. His deep dive on discipline and goal setting is a must-listen.

- **Matt D’Avella on YouTube**  
  Minimalist filmmaker who explores discipline, habit change, and lifestyle design. It’s aesthetically soothing and packed with practical advice. Not preachy. Just honest.

- **The Tim Ferriss Show**  
  He interviews top performers from all industries and always drills into routines, systems, and discipline. Tons of gold here.

---

Discipline isn’t about being strict or joyless. It’s about doing what matters, especially when you don’t feel like it. You don’t need to wait for a wave of motivation to hit. You just need tools, habits, and systems that make doing the hard things easier.

Motivation is a spark. Discipline is the engine.

Once you rewire your brain to crave action over inspiration, that’s when your life actually starts to change.",1,1767636633.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

**“Let’s Spice Things Up,” Says Mayor**

At a press conference held in front of a suspiciously empty East Precinct, Katie Wilson declared, “Seattle has always been a city of innovation. We gave the world grunge music, gourmet coffee, and now, the freedom to murder. Let’s spice things up and see what happens!”

The mayor went on to explain that the decision was inspired by a desire to “reduce paperwork” and “promote equity.”

“We’ll be referring all murderers to our new deferral program, Killing Now Is For Everyone (KNIFE),” the mayor explained. 

**Local Reactions: Mixed, But Mostly Terrified**

Residents have responded with a mixture of confusion, panic, and a sudden interest in martial arts classes. “I always thought Seattle was a bit too polite,” said one local. “Maybe this will finally get my neighbour to stop borrowing my lawnmower.”

Meanwhile, the city’s police force has pivoted to new duties, such as refereeing disputes over who gets the last doughnut and judging graffiti installations.

**Tourism Board Rebrands: “Seattle – Come for the Coffee, Stay Because You Can’t Leave”**

The Seattle Tourism Board has wasted no time updating its marketing materials. “We’re expecting a surge in visitors,” said the board’s spokesperson. “Mostly thrill-seekers and people who’ve watched too many crime dramas.”

**Legal Experts: “We’re Not Sure If This Is Even Possible”**

Legal experts are scrambling to interpret the new policy. “We’re pretty sure this violates several state, federal, and universal laws,” said one lawyer, “but we’re also afraid to object too loudly given our local propensity for groupthink.”

**What’s Next?**

Rumours suggest that Mayor Wilson is considering legalising jaywalking, double-parking, and the use of pineapple on $8 slices of pizza. “Seattle is ready for anything,” the mayor said, “except maybe car traffic. That’s still illegal.”

For example Lonzo , Hunter , allen combination  for Myles turner and Amir coffee gets you under the apron ( tested it last night on spotrac a third team like the Nets is needed) also this is basically Hunter and allen for turner and Coffee , lonzo is a salary dump

Installation was easier than I expected and the instructions were clear enough to handle it without a plumber. Filter changes are quick and simple which makes maintenance easy.

**Water quality is the biggest improvement.**

The chlorine taste is completely gone and the water tastes clean and neutral. Coffee tea and even ice taste better. The flow rate has been consistent and does not feel slow.

The smart faucet and display are actually useful.

Being able to see TDS and filter status at a glance gives peace of mind and removes any guessing.

***Customer service has been excellent from what I have seen and experienced.***

1q4t2zm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4t2zm,Looking for advice to organize and make my small kitchen more functional and welcoming (family of 5),"Hi everyone!
I’m looking for advice and fresh ideas to better organize and decorate my kitchen.

I’m a stay-at-home mom, so I spend a lot of time at home, and it’s really important to me to feel good in my space. We’ve been living in this apartment for almost 8 years, and we plan to stay long-term because the rent is very affordable. We have 3 kids, so there’s a lot of life happening in this kitchen every single day.

The kitchen is small, but I truly believe there’s still potential to make it more functional and more pleasant. Over the years, I’ve tried different ways to optimize the space, and while it does work, I feel like it could work better.

The space is small, but I believe it has more potential. I only have this small section of counter as my main work surface. The coffee maker and toaster need to stay there because the only accessible electrical outlets are in that spot. Other items currently on the counter (sourdough starter, kombucha, kefir) can be moved.

From day one, we installed the two wall shelves that hold the microwave and some storage above the washer. Yes, our washer and dryer are in the kitchen, and unfortunately, they can’t be relocated.

You can also see the shelf above the door where I keep my cookbooks. That area doesn’t really bother me; I’m okay with it as is.

Where I really feel stuck is:
	•	the pantry
	•	the recycling / compost / fruits & veggies area

I know there’s room for improvement there, but I’m not sure what direction to take.

Some constraints:
	•	The door must stay fully accessible since we go outside often.
	•	The space behind the pantry must remain accessible because there’s an electrical panel there. The pantry either needs to be movable or have an opening/access panel.

I also own several small appliances that are currently stored in different cabinets, but they’re not very accessible. I’d love to reorganize things so I can actually use them more easily : possibly by incorporating them into the pantry area in a smart way.

So basically:
What would you do with this space to make it more functional?
And bonus points if you have ideas to make the dining area feel warmer and more welcoming for a family of five.

Boring life? Not anymore. From now on, you're the irl Mary Sue. Everything you want to happen for the plot, happens for the plot. Every time you think “this would only happen in fiction,” it happens in YOUR life — not sometimes — EVERY SINGLE DAY. There's ALWAYS something happening: a confession, a flirtation, a moment, a plot twist, a coincidence TOO PERFECT. And your friends are constantly like: “HOW ARE YOU A REAL PERSON?? WHY DOES THIS ONLY HAPPEN TO YOU???” Every single day feels like the universe is obsessed with making your life OVER THE TOP, unbelievable kind of entertaining with all the romantic cliches imaginable. You're literally like that the “everyone gasps when they walk in” character. People GO INSANE when they see you because why do you look like THAT?? Random love interest appear in your life every single day. You get love confessions. Not maybe. Regularly. Things happen to you like bumping into the same hot person three times in one week, someone running after you to confess, strangers complimenting you, someone asking you to get coffee sometime. Every group around you becomes your group. You’re that person who knows everyone and everyone wants to know you. You get invited everywhere. You have the same kind of reputation Jugyeong from True Beauty had — people idolize you, you're literally the “queen of the school,” “goddess of the campus”, hallway crush and the list goes on. You're always protected by ridiculous, the most obvious levels of plot armor. Things just… work out for you. You naturally succeed at everything: you get every opportunity, every crush likes you back, teachers love you, bosses favor you, people literally treat you like a celebrity. You're good at everything for no reason. Everywhere you go, you somehow end up entangled with attractive people — billionaires, idols, artists, athletes, emotionally unavailable men suddenly very available and every single one of them falls for you.

But my question is, like if someone does confess to me is it even genuine.  I'm not really sure like how to explain this feeling, but I feel like anytime someone confesses to me or smt it'll feel fake because I was listening to this subliminal so it's only happening because of the subliminal, and I'm just like manipulating people and the universe to like me.  I don't know if that makes any sense but it doesn't feel genuine to me.  I'm wondering if anyone thinks similarly or if anyone disagrees and why because I do like this but I just can't get that out of my head. Any advice?",1,1767636314.0,Subliminal,1,1.0,False

In the 1950s, the kind of decade that mistook glamour for permanence, he had already learned how fragile power could be. He was a man whose name traveled faster than he did — stitched into labels, whispered in salons, printed beneath photographs of women who wore his clothes like armor. Wealth had made him untouchable, fame had made him unreal, and yet none of it could prevent the quiet, humiliating fact of a stalled engine on a forgotten road.

The car died without ceremony. No explosion, no drama—just a cough, a shudder, and silence. He tried once, then twice, then stepped out into a stretch of land that seemed to have misplaced itself on the map. Fields between forests and hills, a horizon that refused to offer answers. Somewhere in the distance, a town existed not because anyone had planned it, but because people had needed to stop moving.

He walked the rest of the way.

The town was small enough to feel accidental. A few buildings, a gas pump, a pub with a faded sign whose paint had given up years ago. Inside, time moved more slowly, as if it had nowhere urgent to be. The smell of fried food clung to the walls, and a radio hummed softly behind the bar. He stepped in not as a legend, but as a man who needed a phone and something warm to eat.

That was when she appeared.

She was not remarkable in the way magazines demanded. No careful polish, no cultivated mystery. Just young, tired in the way people get when they have never left where they were born, and beautiful in a way that felt almost unfair to the room she stood in. She wore a simple uniform, apron tied too tightly, hair pinned back with more effort than reward. When she spoke, it was with the practiced kindness of someone who had learned to be pleasant without being hopeful.

She took his order. She pointed him toward the phone. She noticed, without comment, that his suit did not belong in this place.

It was only later — between the coffee refills and the sound of his voice drifting through the receiver — that she understood who he was. Not because he announced it, but because men like him carried their gravity with them. When he asked about a mechanic, she gave him a name. When he asked how long it would take, she shrugged and said the truth: maybe today, maybe tomorrow. Things moved differently here.

He stayed.

They spoke in fragments at first. About the car. About the road. About how far the nearest city was. Then, gradually, about other things — things that did not belong to either of them but hovered anyway. He mentioned a runway delayed by an unexpected absence, a model who had vanished hours before she was meant to walk. He said it lightly, as if it were an inconvenience rather than a crack in a carefully controlled world. She listened, eyes sharp now, posture altered by interest she could not hide.

She asked what a runway was like. He told her.

Not in grand terms, but honestly — the lights, the music, the way a room could hold its breath. The way clothes could turn a person into someone unrecognizable, even to themselves. She laughed once, short and disbelieving, and said she had never owned anything beautiful that wasn’t meant for Sunday.

He looked at her then. Really looked.

The thought came to him fully formed and dangerous in its simplicity: she could do it. Not just wear the clothes, but inhabit them. She had a way of standing that suggested escape, a restlessness that no amount of small-town politeness could disguise. When he said as much, she went very still.

She did not ask if he was serious. She asked what would happen if she said yes.

He told her the truth, or at least the version of it he believed in: trains, cities, rooms full of strangers who would learn her face. Work that was not easy but was transformative. A chance that came once, if it came at all.

She told him she would go.

Not because of the clothes — though the thought of silk and cashmere made her smile — but because she had always known she would leave. This was simply the shape her leaving took. She said it plainly, as if stating a fact that had been waiting for the right witness.

There were only two conditions.

He could not let anyone from that town know where she went.
He could not bring her back.

The words were calm, but they carried the weight of something buried. Whatever waited for her beyond the pub’s door was not nostalgia. It was obligation, expectation, a life already decided. She wanted distance, not just miles but erasure.

He agreed.

The mechanic arrived near dusk. The car was fixed with unremarkable efficiency, hands blackened with grease, the problem resolved as quietly as it had appeared. Before she left with him, she asked for a little time. He waited at the edge of town while she walked the familiar road back to the farm where she had been raised.

The fields were loud with work when she arrived—her father and brother bent to their labor, backs turned, attention fixed on the earth that had claimed them long ago. No one saw her slip into the house. Inside, she moved quickly and without sentiment, gathering only what could be carried: a change of clothes, a small bundle of personal things, nothing that would slow her down or invite questions later. She did not write a note. There was no point in explaining an absence that had been inevitable for years.

When she left the farmhouse, she did so unseen, the door closing softly behind her. By the time the sun dipped low enough to stain the windows amber, she was back on the road. She climbed into the passenger seat of his car with her small bag at her feet and the certainty, now sharpened and irreversible, that she would never belong to that land again.

From the outside, it might have looked reckless. A powerful older man indulging a whim. A young woman mistaking opportunity for salvation. History would later reduce it to a footnote—a discovery, a muse, a lucky break. But from a distance wide enough to see the truth, it was something quieter and more exact.

It was a man whose world had been meticulously constructed, interrupted by chance. It was a woman who had been waiting for an interruption her entire life.

And somewhere between a broken-down car and a fading town, they both stepped off the path they were meant to follow—never looking back, and never saying each other’s names aloud, as if naming the moment might undo it.

Hey there! Just a heads up, I won’t be replying to simple messages like “Hi” or “Hello.” When you reach out, let me know what you’re into, or if you have any ideas in mind!

I prefer F4M for this plot, where I’d play the female. You don’t have to be male yourself, just play the older gentleman! A quick note: My characters are usually petite and short. If that’s not your thing, we might not be a good match.

THIS WILL BE SET IN THE 1950s!!!

I love story-driven roleplays, especially slow-burn romances where characters grow and connect naturally. A 60/40 mix is my ideal, but I could also go for a 50/50 balance.

I’d prefer someone literate. I usually write quite a lot and in a very detailed manner, so don’t bother me for one-liners! Adv-Lit to Novella is preferred! Also, 3rd person only, please. I have more than 10 years of experience in roleplay, so I know what I’m looking for in a roleplay partner!

Additionally, I would really like it if you played a reference I will be providing! Just as your character’s face/body claim! If not, do keep in mind that I’m very picky about my partner’s character’s appearance!

And please note: I only want to be contacted by adults (18 years and older). If you’ve read all this, include the word ‘Bubble’ in your message! (｀_´)ゞ (I won’t be responding to messages without it!) ",1,1767636275.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Although I call them ""minimum"" features, the idea is that nothing essential is missing (and sorry for the long list. Tonight I'll start redesigning the website so you can read this visually without having a stroke, I'll let you know if you want to wait):

# 1. System & Architecture

* **Total Privacy:** Works 100% offline. Your data is stored on your phone and encrypted. No one (not even me, though who knows why I'd want to see your data anyway) can see it.
* **Data Freedom:** You can import your history from other apps (Hevy, Strong, etc.) and export everything you do here whenever you want.
* **Zen Mode (Optional, Mental Health):** An option to hide red numbers, ""you went over"" alerts, and any moral judgment. Designed to avoid anxiety or potential EDs.
* **Bullying Mode (Optional):** For those who prefer ""tough love."" The app will use a humorous and aggressive tone if you skip workouts.
* **Open Source:** Free and transparent.
* **Web Architecture (PWA):** Everything runs from the browser, but you can install it like any other app on your phone to remove friction, or simply keep using it from the web. Both ways are valid.

# 2. Nutrition

* **Smart Diets:** No more copying and pasting meals. You create a ""Base Diet"" with fixed foods (what you always eat) and variable foods (options to choose depending on the day, e.g., ""Today is Protein: Chicken or Omelette?"").
* **Food Groups:** Group multiple items (e.g., Coffee + Toast + Oil) and log them with a single click.
* **Quick Register (Smart Checks):** A simple checkbox to mark that you ate what was planned. If you want to be precise, you can edit the grams, but otherwise, one click and you're done.
* **The ""Sweet Spot"":** Instead of obsessing over an exact calorie number, the app shows you a visual ideal range that is still optimal and effective for the diet.
* **Hybrid Search:** Clean internal database (300 manually curated items) + Barcode Scanner (thanks to Open Food Facts) + the ability to add your own foods.
* **Calculators:** Automatic or manual calculation of your BMR, maintenance/cutting/bulking calories, and macros. Includes a calculator estimating how long it will take to lose fat to reach your target weight.
* **Nutritional Dashboard:** Updates as you eat to visualize calories and macros graphically and intuitively.

# 3. Training

* **Planning:** Organize your training weeks (Mesocycles) defining if you are aiming for strength or hypertrophy.
* **Flexible Routines:** Create routines and change the exercise order on the fly without breaking anything. The app analyzes if your routine is unbalanced (e.g., too much chest and little back) or balanced.
* **Live Logging:** Rest timer, set logging (Weight, Reps, RIR). The app will automatically suggest increasing the weight if it sees it's too easy for you.
* **Biomechanics (Your AI Coach):** Upload or record a video and the app will analyze your angles, range of motion, and velocity. It draws the ""skeleton"" over the video so you can see your technique.
* **1RM Calculator:** Estimates your max strength automatically.
* **Curated Database:** List of 150-250 hand-reviewed exercises, with metadata such as muscle groups involved and % activation per muscle head.

# 4. Progress

* **Body Measurements:** Register up to 17 different body zones.
* **Skinfolds (Plicometry):** If you use a caliper, you can register 10 different folds. The app will choose the most precise mathematical formula to calculate your real Body Fat %.
* **Stats:** Evolution graphs for weight, fat, strength, and more.

And yes, we're done. The worst part is that this list is actually simplified so you don't explode, but anyway, if you've made it this far (congrats first), I hope it was worth it. Cheers. <3",1,1767636082.0,aerko_,0,1.0,False

Kazumi fits right into the chaos of the classroom. She doesn't particularly spend time with any specific group of her classmates, usually spending her time with whoever asks first or most energetically.

She trains hard, works hard, and always has that feral grin on her face as she does. It's something that her classmates learn to expect from her, always upbeat. Even her sleep schedule is off in comparison to the rest of the class—she'll go to bed early and wake up even earlier, like she prefers the early mornings to the late nights.

The early morning training sessions become something of a legend in Class 1-A. Students would stumble into the gym at 6 AM only to find Kazumi already there, sweat-soaked and grinning like she'd been awake for hours—which she usually had.

""*Damn*, Okabe! Do you even sleep?"" Kirishima would yawn, rubbing his eyes as he watched her nail a backflip off the gym wall.

Kazumi would just flash that sharp-toothed smile, tail flicking. ""Nah, *sleep's* for people who aren't trying to be the *best*.""

Bakugo would scoff from his spot at the weights, but there was something *almost* resembling approval in his glare. ""At least someone here has their priorities straight.""

When Aizawa would eventually shuffle in, coffee in hand, he'd just sigh and say, ""At least one of you has common sense.""

The thing was.. Kazumi wasn't just training for herself. She'd corner classmates randomly, dragging them into impromptu sparring sessions or Quirk analysis deep dives.

She was especially relentless when it came to Bakugo—challenging him to sparring matches at any opportunity and analyzing his combat moves with a calculating gleam in her eye.

""Come *on*,"" she'd say, her tail flicking in excitement. ""One more match.""

Bakugo would grumble, but more often than not, he'd accept. And every time, Kazumi would lose—but she’d lose grinning, wiping blood from her split lip like it was nothing. ""*Again*.""

Bakugo would scoff, palms sparking. ""You’re not gonna beat me just by throwing yourself at me a hundred times, idiot.""

""Then I’ll go for a hundred and *one*.""

It became a routine. A *ritual*.

Bakugo would always win, but each victory grew harder-earned. Kazumi was relentless, unfazed by any injury or exhaustion, just throwing herself back into the fray again and again like some kind of feral cat playing with its prey.

Her classmates watch with a mix of horror and wonder—some of them worried about her well-being, others just amazed at her sheer stubborn determination.

""She's *crazy*,"" Kaminari mutters one day, watching her stagger to her feet for the nth time.

Kirishima nods, both concerned and awestruck. ""Yeah, but she's our lunatic.""

\-

One evening, after a particularly brutal sparring session, Jiro corners Kazumi in the dorm kitchen, arms crossed. ""Okay, seriously. What’s the deal with you and Bakugo? You got a death wish or something?""

Kazumi, rummaging through the fridge for a juice box, pauses mid-reach. Her tail flicks once before she shrugs. ""Nah. Just figured if I can survive him, I can survive anything.""

Jiro raises an eyebrow. ""That’s it?""

Kazumi stabs the straw into her juice with a sharp grin. "".. Well, that and pissing him off is *hilarious*.""

From the couch, Bakugo lobs a couch cushion at her head without looking up from his manga. ""I HEARD THAT, YOU DAMN CAT.""

Kazumi cackles, dodging the projectile with cat-like grace. ""See? *Instant results*.""

Jiro sighs, shaking her head. ""You're *insane*.""

Kazumi chuckles as she picks up the couch cushion, tucking it under her arm as she glances over to Bakugo. ""You want anything from the fridge that I can offer as tribute, Kats?""

Bakugo shoots her a withering glare, but he lowers his manga slightly to glance at her. ""Don't call me that. And get me a soda.""

Kazumi throws a mock salute. ""Roger that."" She heads back to the fridge, her tail swaying lazily behind her. ""And.. Well, I think it's fair. You call me *cat* all the time, only fair I call you Kats.""

Bakugo’s eye twitches dangerously. “Say it again and I’ll turn you into a goddamn fur rug.”

Kazumi tosses him a soda with a grin. “You’d miss me too much, *Kats*.” The can explodes instantly as soon as it reaches his hand.

Jiro snorts into her hand. “RIP. We barely knew her.” Kirishima shakes his head fondly. “And thus ends the *tragic* tale of Kazumi Okabe—”

Bakugo lunges across the room, throwing his manga onto the coffee table. Kazumi dives over the kitchen island with a cackle, scattering snacks everywhere as he chases her around the common room in a blur of cursing and manic laughter.

Mina watches the chaos unfold from the couch, lazily tossing popcorn into her mouth. ""Y'know, most people *avoid* making Bakugo want to murder them. Kazumi's out here collecting murder attempts like trading cards.""

Sero nods sagely. ""She's got a death wish wrapped in a bomber jacket.""

Nearby, Kazumi has managed to do another loop around the fridge. She snags a second can of soda and lobs it at Bakugo like a grenade. ""Peace treaty! *Truce*! ***Parley!***""

Bakugo catches the can and scowls, raising it in one hand ominously. ""You think a *soda's* gonna save you?""

""Worth a shot!""

Jiro hums, twirling an earphone jack loosely with a finger. ""I swear, sometimes I think I'm watching a cat play with its food."" Mina nods sagely. ""Or maybe a mouse playing with a *very* angry tiger."" Kirishima laughs, leaning back on the couch. ""Either way, they look like they're having a good time.""

Bakugo glowers at Kazumi before growling as he cracks open the soda with a sharp hiss—the sound coming both from the can and his own irritated exhale. He takes a long swig before pointing the can at Kazumi like a weapon. ""Next time you pull that shit, I'm blasting you through the *goddamn wall*.""

Kazumi drapes herself dramatically over the kitchen counter, tail flicking. ""Aw, but then who'd keep you from getting bored during training?""

From his spot on the couch, Kaminari snorts. ""Dude, she's got you there. You've been way less grumpy since she started bugging you.""

1q4swve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lausanne/comments/1q4swve/cycling_in_lausanne/,Cycling in Lausanne,"Hey folks,

I’ve recently moved to Lausanne for a few months for an exec educational program, and this is also my first time in Switzerland. Originally from India, I’ve been cycling regularly there for over 4+ years and also spent some time riding in Japan, so reasonably used to city riding. I brought my Gravel bike to Lausanne.

Over the last week I’ve been exploring Ouchy, Pully, Lutry, and Prilly, and loved the lakeside  – but the city centre hills are harder to ride and feel pretty brutal to ride through compared to what I’m used to.

Had a few questions that I was hoping the local r/Lausanne folks could help with:

1. Cycling rules / “single source of truth”
   * Are there any Lausanne- or Vaud-specific rules I should know about beyond the usual “ride on the right, follow traffic lights, don’t use sidewalks unless marked as shared,” etc.?
   * Is there an official website or portal (city, canton, or national) that locals consider the go‑to reference for cycling rules and best practices here?
2. Parking a bike around town
   * How safe is it in practice to leave a bike locked outside Coop/Migros, coffee shops, or in the city centre for 30–60 minutes? Things feel very safe here, but a colleague warned me of bike theft in certain parts of the city.
   * Any local norms, e.g. “always use the covered parking near stations,” “never leave it overnight outside,” or preferred lock types/brands that actually deter thieves here?
3. Communities and longer routes (50–100 km)
   * Are there any local cycling clubs or group rides around Lausanne for weekend rides?
   * Any must‑ride routes you’d recommend starting from Lausanne? I’ve heard a bit about riding through towards Montreux/Vevey. 

Thanks a lot in advance for any tips, links, or route ideas – and if anyone’s up for showing a newcomer around on a weekend ride, I’d love to join!",1,1767636067.0,Lausanne,1,1.0,False

I have been a serial shy introverted guy for 26 years. I had like 5 friends but most of them moved out of the country for higher studies like Phd. To state the obvious never been a relationship too so I'm even more shy with girls around and want to come out of this shell.

I have been a bit lonely since last 2 years and cant make friends due to social anxiety. I have taken up a huge step just typing this here to be a little more open and overcome this situation.

What I'm looking for.
Nothing more than a meet-up to go out like a trek or a coffee meet up. I have also taken up fitness finally after being obese all my life so any peeps into fitness who can help me motivate to be a better and give more tips is highly appreciated. I'm a huge into anime movies and literature media as well as gaming so if we have this common i think I will be able to hold my best in the conversation.

Canceled our next date, have heard nothing since. Delete her number and move on, correct?**

This'll be short and simple. Met a super smart, beautiful girl who is definitely my type on Hinge. We texted a few, spoke on the phone, met up for coffee. Spent almost 2 hours talking and flirting.

At the end of said date, I grabbed her hand and said very plainly, I had a great god damned time and I want to see her again asap. Don't care what, but I am making it clear that I like you and cannot wait to spend more time getting to know you.

She smiled and said definitely. And we were both on our merry. This was last Tuesday. NYE rolls around and it was raining so we both were not gonna do anything. But we started texting, another great phone call. As the night wore on...the texts got spicy (she initiated) I replied in kind, and we made plans to spend New Years day together. At midnight, I sent her a happy new years text to no response. I made a few reservations at restaurants near her for NY Day and I was damned excited.

She responds to my GM text Wednesday a few hours later, says she is really not feeling well, and had to take a rain check. I said sure, I hope she feels better and if she needs a med run, let me know, I'd be happy to do so. She says thank you. I sent another text later that night saying I hope she was feeling better and was thinking about her.

Since then, absolute radio silence. No phone calls, no responses to any texts, no options to reschedule our time together. To me, this is very clear that she is over it, but I want just wanted to vent and make sure I am not misreading this.

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P1XFYJP](https://water.listbuff.com/waterdrop-g3)

The unit fits cleanly under the sink and does not take up much space since it is tankless. That was important for me because I did not want to lose all my storage.

Installation was easier than expected and the instructions were clear enough to do it without calling a plumber. Filter changes are simple and do not feel messy or complicated.

**Water quality is the biggest upgrade.**

Our tap water had a noticeable chlorine taste before and now it is completely gone. The water tastes clean and neutral and you can really notice it in coffee tea and even ice.

The flow rate has been consistent and filling a glass does not feel slow like older RO systems.

I also like the smart faucet and display.

Being able to see TDS and filter status at a glance is genuinely useful and not just marketing. You always know when a filter is getting close to needing a change.

***Customer service has been a standout.***

From what I have seen and personally experienced they respond quickly and actually take responsibility when something goes wrong. Replacement parts filters and even full units have been sent out without hassle.

This is not a promotion just a genuine vibe check before we take a step further.  
A friend and I have been exploring the idea of building a small, invite-only travel community in the long run the kind that’s more about people, conversations, and shared experiences than loud parties or dating scenes.  
As a starting point, we’re considering a single short villa trip (day + night) about **2–3 hours from Pune**, just to see if there’s interest in something like this.

What the experience would look like:  
• A private villa, \~2–3 hours from Pune (a small bus would be arranged so a short bus roadtrip (optional, only if everyone is interested)  
• 10 curated people (balanced mix, all strangers), aged 23-35  
• Invite-only, profile-based selection, quality >>> quantity  
• Coffee, chill conversations, games, pool games(optional) ( card, group, etc)  
• Live jamming session with a guitarist, casual singing.  
• A mix of Bollywood, techno & afro (house-party vibe, not a club)  
• Food and beverages (Alcohol optional - maybe not )  
• Plenty of room to relax, talk, laugh, and just be present

  
The idea is not to rush anything or over-engineer fun just a clean, well-planned villa vibe with people who actually enjoy conversations and music.

Also sharing this openly:  
One of the planners is a woman, and the group would be thoughtfully balanced and curated before inviting anyone  the goal is for everyone to feel comfortable joining without overthinking it.  
  
**Purely a survey question:**  
If something like this was thoughtfully curated and invite-only, would you personally: Be open to paying a reasonable amount for a day + night experience

I'm 27 and casually started drinking sugar coffee drinks in college and then advanced to bring instant coffee around with me so I wouldn't have to pay for it. out 

  
I took breaks but then started again with my first corporate job around 2021. I got to the point where I found myself drinking 64oz of black coffee (blonde roast) a day which is equal to 8 cups of coffee.

  
I stopped in like march of 2022 and felt great. I missed coffee but I loved not being anxious and tired and angry all the time. 

  
June of 2022 I started again because I thought I needed the energy while working on my house and that catapulted me into September 2025. 3 years later the time flew and found myself so anxious and irritable needing to drink 2 cups a day.

  
I went cold turkey and of course I missed the taste but again the trade offs were never worth the pain.

  
I now order hot water everywhere I go as a replacement.

  
So it leads to yesterday my gf wanted to go try the new matcha shop in town and I love her so I went. They have an alternative called ""Hochija"" (a distinctive Japanese green tea made by roasting tea leaves (often stems and twigs too) over charcoal)  and when I looked it up the caffeine content was from 5-10mg which in my head is nothing.

  
Last night I was tossing and turning restless. I'm like why can't I sleep??

1q4ssxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q4ssxr/guide_to_staying_safely_at_truck_stop_rv_hookups/,guide to staying safely at truck stop rv hookups for overnight travel,"  
hey everyone, i know this comes up a lot when you're on a long haul and just need to crash for a few hours without dropping a ton of cash at a full campground. is using the rv hookups at a truck stop safe? the short answer is usually yes, but there are some things you need to know about the difference between a paid hookup spot and just parking in the free lot.  
  
if you're really worried about safety and just want a quieter, more private spot to sleep, you should check out prked. it's an app for renting out private driveways and empty garage spaces, often from people in residential areas. it's way cheaper than most campgrounds and honestly feels much safer because you're on someone's property. a lot of hosts take care of the car too, and sometimes they'll even drive you to a nearby spot if you need it. you skip all the parking chaos and it's quick in and out. it's great for when you want a vip parking experience for less.  
  
now back to the truck stops. the biggest chains like love's, pilot flying j, and ta travel centers have started adding dedicated rv 'hookup' or 'stop' spots. these are usually a separate area, sometimes offset from the main truck parking, and they offer 30 or 50 amp electric, water, and sometimes sewer hookups for a fee. a spot at a love's rv hookup can run you around $43 to $57 a night as of march 2024, which is comparable to a budget campground but with the convenience of being right off the highway. because they are reservable and in a dedicated area, they tend to be much safer and quieter than the free parking.  
  
for general safety, whether you are at a paid hookup spot or just using the free lot for a quick rest, trust your gut. if the whole place feels sketchy, don't stay. always park in a well-lit area, preferably where you can see the main store entrance or where you think a security camera might be pointed.  
  
the free overnight spots are generally considered safe for a basic rest stop, but they are loud. you'll hear trucks idling and refrigerator units humming all night, so bring earplugs. always lock your windows and doors.  
  
a huge piece of etiquette is that truckers get priority. they are there for federally mandated rest breaks, so never park in a spot designated for trucks, even if the lot looks empty. only use the car/rv-designated areas. also, if you're just parking for free, don't put out your slide-outs or set up chairs outside—it's overnight parking, not camping. make a purchase inside, even just coffee or fuel, to be a respectful customer. plan to get back on the road early, before 8 am is best.

It should never be too much to ask of the man I love, if he loved me too, for a phone call, for a coffee date, for anything other than connection kept at a safe enough distance so that it can never really hurt you.

It was too much to ask of you. Therefore, you couldn’t possibly be my person. So pity yourself that I left if you want. Feel sorry for yourself that this connection is lost. It is not at all for a lack of my trying.

•	I opened my email and closed it for “mental preparation”

	

•	I made coffee, forgot about it, then made another

	

•	I said “busy day ahead” without knowing what that means

No sad vibes, just classic Midwest Monday energy where everyone’s back but nobody’s fully back.

Posting into the Reddit void to see who else is also:

	•	“Locked in” (staring at their screen)

	•	Saying “welp” before switching tasks

	•	Pretending meetings are productive today

	•	Waiting for lunch like it’s a milestone event

If you’re at work, semi-focused, and running on coffee and sarcasm, say hi.

My story is that for more than a year now I’ve been seeing heart shapes everywhere.

I’m not obsessively looking for them. For example, I’m sitting on a chair in the garden, I look up, and the wires form a heart shape; I drink my coffee and the remaining foam marks form a heart. (Literally everywhere I looked I saw heart-shaped things/objects) This started in the spring of 2024. I really started wondering whether I’m being stupid or just imagining these things?! But I really hope they have some kind of meaning. I didn’t ask for a sign, I didn’t ask for guidance. I just accepted that life goes on no matter what happens; I no longer wanted to prevent anything. What has to happen will happen.

Before that, a lot of bad things happened to me. I saw the first heart-shaped object in February 2024, that’s when this started, and that was when I decided I wanted to work in France on a ship. Then I started working on the ship in March, and after that I saw these heart shapes more and more often. Many times almost on a daily basis.

Then in September I met a guy, really just by chance. The ship stopped in a different city almost every day, and with the work we didn’t have much free time for ourselves. In one of the cities I picked out a café where I thought I’d go if I had time. It turned out I had a day off in that city, and I had picked out several places but couldn’t decide, so I stuck with the first option. The guy literally bumped into me by accident and almost knocked me over just as I was done there and wanted to pay for my coffee at the counter.

From the first glance I felt that something tied me to him, chained me to him. I felt that I almost had to, was obliged to somehow make contact with him, but I was scared and shy. I spent two weeks searching for who he might be, but I had no success. Then one of my colleagues helped me and we found the guy. We started talking, but we couldn’t meet in person for more than a month. Trust and attraction developed between us very quickly. We fell in love without meeting. Everything between us happened very fast. In December he proposed to me, and in February I moved to France; we were planning the wedding for 2026 and we wanted a family too. Everything was almost perfect. But after a while it all went wrong, and this December he broke up with me. We were both stupid. I didn’t want to lose him. Past traumas often got in the way. We both tried to grow, but we didn’t do it at the same ‘speed’.

But I feel that between him and me, this is not the end like this.

The whole time I saw hearts: before the relationship, during it, and after it as well.

# Running Art Exhibits



[**Art Exhibit — Sherman Fleming: Unsettled**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-sherman-fleming-unsettled/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* Known for his provocative performances, Sherman Fleming (b. 1953), is an influential multimedia artist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This focused survey gathers works spanning forty years of Fleming’s career, presenting paintings, drawings, ephemera, and documentation of his performances made between 1978–2019.
* Fleming’s works are demonstrations of perseverance, self-control, and conviction. The artist’s main medium is his body, which he uses in myriad ways. His endurance performances span hours and even months and include walking through Philadelphia for a day while carrying an eight-foot-tall wooden phallus along with spending a year wearing a noose—objects purposely chosen as material reminders of racial and sexual stereotypes of Black masculinity as well as the ongoing trauma of racialized terrorism in the United States.
* The unsettling nature of his work pushes the boundaries of discomfort as the imagery features both difficult subjects and unresolved compositions. Overall, Fleming’s complex practice is connected through his relentless processes that consistently expand the horizons of what art can be and how it may be experienced on paper, canvas, in a gallery, in a theatre, or even live on the street. Through his innovative explorations of identity, the artist’s messaging continues to resonate in profound ways, many years after its making.
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* September 29- January 18

[**Art Exhibit — Dis/orient: Contemporary Art of the Asian Diaspora**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-dis-orient-contemporary-art-of-the-asian-diaspora/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* A focused exhibition that examines how artists of Asian descent confront long-standing stereotypes embedded in the word “Orient.” Rooted in Western imperialism, the term historically enforced a sense of distance and “otherness” that continues to shape cultural perceptions today. Dis/orient brings together artists who use humor, memory, tradition, and personal narrative to challenge this legacy and illuminate the richness and multiplicity of the Asian diaspora.
* “Dis/orient invites viewers to look beyond the flattened idea of a single ‘Orient’ and instead appreciate the complexity, humor, and emotional depth that define contemporary Asian diasporic art,” said Julianne Miao, curatorial associate at the Nasher Museum. “Each artist brings a distinct perspective, reminding us that identity is never monolithic. It is lived, questioned, and continually reshaped.”
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* January 4- July 19

[**Art Exhibition — Labor&Materials and The Intuitionist**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/exhibition-opening-reception-labor-materials-and-the-intuitionist-2/) at **21c Museum Hotel Durham**

* 21c Durham is unveiling two new exhibitions with Labor & Materials and The Intuitionist. The exhibitions feature a thematic group exhibition of 67 multi-media artworks by 40 artists from across the globe exploring the evolution of industry and labor in the 21st century and a two-person exhibition of paintings by Atlanta-based artist Xavier Daniels and Toronto-based artist Natia Lemay.

ideally something that provides data and stats about consumption and how it relates to sleep but also keeps track of brew methods (pourover, espresso, etc.)

i'd like to find all the data about my daily coffee usage in one place and then see the data in a visualizer, almost like a whoop or fitness tracking recap.

1q4slle,https://i.redd.it/jmah4n3njkbg1.jpeg,Steam knob issue with [Lelit Elizabeth],"I am on my first day with my Elizabeth and already having an issue with the steam knob. I steamed milk for a latte and shut it off, but then when I went to clean it and turn it back on to get the residual milk out, the knob turned and turned... And turned... without actually turning it on. The knob upon investigating could be pulled off, and lo and behold... the knob is plastic inside, extremely hot, and seems to have expanded to the point it is too pliable to turn the metal rod that controls the steam unit.  The metal rod itself was so hot I couldn't touch it. Yes, I let it cool and was able to turn it on clean at least when it was only warm. 

I know the issue here is obvious, but want to know if others have had this issue?? I see there are wooden replacement knobs for some other Lelit machines but don't see any available for the Elizabeth, so I'm wondering if that metal rod typically gets that hot or if it's a deeper issue and it shouldn't be getting there at all... (I have my steam temp set to 205). I may go back to the coffee shop with the knob to see if the other unit replacement knobs might fit. (This is such a silly design error; I am sort of in disbelief this is as intended day 1!!)

Note: I did also notice it pulled a much longer shot this morning than my test last night, though I expect this is a grind issue given my grinder is on backorder and won't be here for a month so I'm having to hand grind and eyeball it a bit at the moment (though my test last night was very, very good, but with a decaf bean 😊. The steamer had no issues then!)",1,1767635422.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1q4sl2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q4sl2w/im_a_forest_ranger_in_the_pacific_northwest/,I’m a Forest Ranger in the Pacific Northwest. There’s a reason we don't use sirens after midnight.,"I’ve worked in this park for eight years. Most people think my job is rescuing hikers from bears or putting out campfires, but 90% of it is just making sure people don't find the things they aren't supposed to see.

When you start the job, the veterans give you a handbook. It’s not official government issue. It’s a weathered, leather-bound notebook passed down from ranger to ranger. The first page has only one sentence: ""The forest has ears, but it doesn't have a heart.""

Last Tuesday, I was patrolling the North Ridge—a place so dense with pine trees that the sunlight barely touches the ground even at noon. Around 1:00 AM, my radio crackled. It wasn't a voice. It was the sound of a woman humming. It was a sweet, melodic tune, like a lullaby.

The problem? I was fifty miles from the nearest campsite, and the North Ridge has been closed to the public since the ""disappearances"" in 1994.

I pulled my truck over and listened. The humming started coming from outside the cabin. It was echoing from the trees. I grabbed my flashlight and shined it into the woods. The beams hit the trunks, but between the shadows, I saw them.

Uniforms.

There were six figures standing in a circle about twenty yards away. They were wearing old Forest Ranger uniforms—the style we stopped using in the seventies. They were standing perfectly still, their backs to me.

""Identify yourselves!"" I shouted, my hand hovering over my holster.

They didn't move. But the humming stopped. In the silence that followed, I heard a wet, snapping sound. Like someone breaking dry branches, but muffled. Slowly, the figure closest to me began to turn around.

It didn't have a face. Where the eyes and mouth should have been, there was only smooth, grey bark. Its ""arms"" were long, multi-jointed branches that had grown through the sleeves of the tan uniform.

I didn't wait to see the rest. I jumped back into the truck and slammed it into reverse. As I sped away, I made the mistake of looking in the rearview mirror.

They weren't running. They were stretching. Their wooden limbs were elongating, reaching across the road like living vines. One of them managed to snag the back bumper, and the entire 2-ton truck jerked violently. I floored it, feeling the metal groan until the branch snapped with a sound like a gunshot.

I made it back to the station and woke up my supervisor, Miller. I was shaking, rambling about bark-faces and uniforms. Miller didn't look surprised. He just poured me a cup of black coffee and pointed to the wall behind his desk.

It was a row of framed photos of ""Rangers of the Year"" going back to the fifties. I looked at the photo from 1972. There was a man smiling at the camera, holding a trophy.

His skin looked a little too dry. His fingers were a little too long. And in the background of the photo, behind the celebration, you could see the treeline. Every single tree in that photo was leaning toward the cabin, as if they were listening.

""The forest doesn't kill you,"" Miller said quietly. ""It just needs more wardens. It likes the uniforms. It thinks they make the trap look official.""

I looked down at my own sleeves. I noticed a small, green sprout popping out of the seam of my jacket. I tried to pull it out, but it didn't come.

It wasn't stuck to the fabric. It was growing out of my wrist.

I’m sitting in my cabin now. I’ve barricaded the door, but it doesn't matter. I can hear the roots scratching against the floorboards from underneath. The humming is back, and this time, it’s coming from my own throat.

I think I’m going to be the Ranger of the Year soon.",4,1767635393.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1q4sl0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1q4sl0f/completing_the_stress_response_cycle/,completing the stress response cycle,"hey everyone, I want to share some things I've been reading about in terms of the way stress happens in the body. stress is a physiological cycle (like the digestive cycle) that your body moves through, and there are things we can do to help our bodies complete the cycle so that we don't get stuck in the first part of feeling stressed and scared. 

a lot of this research has been done by Emily and Amelia Nagoski and they have a whole bunch of suggestions, so I really suggest looking up their work.

one way to think about this is that in our evolutionary history, if there were a threat, like a lion chasing you, your body would start all these physical processes to keep you safe and help you run away - like speeding up your breathing and heart rate, increasing your blood pressure, slowing your digestion, etc. This would make it physically possible for you to escape or fight. This is why physical exercise is so so helpful when you're feeling stress or anxiety - it physically helps your body metabolize the stress hormones and understand that you are safe again.

there are other things that can help you complete the stress response cycle, such as:

* deep breathing exercises (particularly breathing out activates the parasympathetic nervous system)
* sleep and rest (dreaming helps your brain process stressful and confusing experiences, and sleep is when your brain flushes out the accumulated waste from each day)
* superficial social connection (this one was new to me, but basically when you go out into the world and get a cup of coffee and say hi to the barista, or have a short conversation with a neighbor, it helps your brain understand again that the world is safe and makes sense)
* intimate social connection (this can be with friends or family members - hugs and long conversations and laughter are especially helpful - and pets count too!)
* time in nature or with animals

these have been particularly helpful for me, but there are others they talk about as well.

one thing I found really helpful to understand is that you can separate the stressor from the stress and deal with them separately. So if you're NC with your pwBPD, that removes the stressor from your life, but you still need to work through the stress response cycle to help your body understand that you're safe - and you can do this every time you start to feel the anxiety or anger. and it also means that for those of you who have to still be in contact with your pwBPD, you can still do all these things to help yourself feel better and safer in your body.

1q4skzs,https://i.redd.it/mlf6qabjjkbg1.jpeg,Shoutout to Red Rooster,"Of course everyone is loving the Ethiopian light roasts that Red Rooster has put out this year— and rightly so— but I feel this washed, Honduran dark roast also deserves a lot of praise. I’ve been traveling this week, so all i’ve got is a flat bottomed brewer and whatever hot water I can get access to, and this has been a lovely daily driver. So sweet. So drinkable. The roast profile is present but not over bearing, especially since I’ve been eyeballing my doses through the whole bag. It’s definately not the bright, punchy, powerful kind of profile that seems to be the most popular these days, but my friends and family who don’t mess with drip seem to enjoy this bag more than any other I’ve brought around. 

Out of curiosity, does anyone else gravitate towards a slightly darker roast than the standard ultra light that’s so popular these days? I’m all for an interesting and challenging cup, but sometimes I want my coffee to just taste like… coffee

The Collins family was unaware that the world was ending. To be fair, they were rarely aware of anything that didn’t directly affect their property values or their seating at the country club.

They were currently trapped in the high-stakes orbit of their own egos. Trip Collins, the patriarch of the family, was running late for an important meeting with the board of August Rose Industries. He attempted to call his assistant to inform him, but for the fourth time, the phone went to voicemail.

“Answer your fucking phone, Tyler,” he cursed under his breath as he slipped on his Gucci blazer.

Trip and his brother, Trager Collins, inherited a multi-million dollar company from their father, who inherited the company from his father. The Collins possessed the kind of generational wealth that renders a person immune to consequences, basic empathy, and the concept of human decency. Their money was tied up in offshore accounts, shell companies, and investments in things that didn’t technically exist.

Sandra Collins, Trip’s wife, a former model and Miss USA, entered the large closet.

“Emily’s back,” she said casually, nursing a mimosa.

Emily Collins was the eldest of Sandra and Trip’s daughters. As much as she fought against the pull of her genetics and birthright, she was still a Collins. She was selfish, self-righteous, and couldn’t make a genuine connection with anyone. A trait that explained why she had burned through fifteen therapists in ten years.

Late last night, Emily had returned home after disowning her family for the third time. Technically, it was the fourth time, but she was too young to remember.

Feeling indifferent to this news, Trip ignored his wife and continued to rush around the room.

Sandra changed the subject as she half-read an email from the party planner.

“I need you home early tonight,” she said. “No later than 5:30.”

Both were ignoring one another. A common occurrence for a couple of twenty-five years.

Soon after, Molly Collins, the couple’s youngest daughter, entered the room.

“Daddy, I need to borrow the G-Wagon,” she demanded.

“No, Molly,” he responded, struggling with his Patek Philippe cufflinks.

“I never get anything I want,” she lied.

Molly had successfully inherited her father’s temper and her mother’s complete detachment from reality, but unfortunately, she missed out on the work ethic required to maintain either.

Trip attempted to call Trager, but he too didn’t answer.

“Why isn’t anyone answering my fucking calls?” he asked before rushing out of the closet.

“Don’t forget,” Sandra called after him, “No later than 5:30!”

Trip rushed out of the house, happily leaving the chaos behind. He was so focused on calling Tyler again that he didn’t notice the mailman eating the gardener in the hydrangeas.

Meanwhile, an angry Molly entered the kitchen to discover her sister, Emily, sitting at the island counter.

“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” Molly said at the sight of her sister.

Molly and Emily were two sides of the same coin. They were the perfect combination of both of their parents’ worst traits. They never got along, even as children. The strain in their relationship was only exacerbated by their meddling mother. She made it no secret that Molly was her preferred daughter and Emily was the ‘problem child’. In reality, Emily was only seen as an issue because she was smarter than Sandra, and they both knew it. The connection that Sandra mistakenly considered a motherly bond with Molly was really a shared obsession with vanity and social status.

“The return of the freeloader. The deadbeat,” Molly said as she opened the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water harvested from icebergs in the Arctic region of Svalbard, Norway. It was more of a status symbol than a source of hydration.

“At least I don’t still live at home with mommy and daddy.” Emily glanced up at her sister for the first time. “What are you wearing?”

It was a valid question, said with valid disgust. Molly was in her late twenties, but dressed like someone ten years younger. She was drowning in a pair of low-rise, camouflage parachute pants that dragged across the marble floor, paired with a rhinestone-encrusted “baby tee” that was essentially a glorified washcloth. It was an outfit designed for a teenage TikTok star.

Molly slammed the fridge door, ignoring her sister’s fashion critique. “Let me guess, you ran out of money? Or wait, your new boyfriend dumped you, didn’t he? Or was it a girl this time?”

“Shut up.” Emily was hunched over, scrolling on her phone.

“So I’m right,” Molly said, twisting the lid off and taking a swig of the water, satisfied with herself.

As if on cue, Sandra appeared, interrupting the bubbling altercation.

“What’s wrong with you two?” Sandra slurred, her morning breakfast of spiked orange juice and Vicodin kicking in. “You’re home not even twenty-four hours, and you’re already at each other’s throats.”

She walked over to the counter where a half-empty champagne bottle sat and topped off her glass.

“I have a big day.” She rubbed her temples. “Tonight’s the charity event. Can’t you two just get along for me?” she said, feigning maternal concern with the practiced ease of a woman who had outsourced her children’s emotional development to a series of underpaid nannies.

“Mom, I need the G-Wagon for tonight,” Molly said, while posting a comment on the Instagram of a socialite she met once at a party.

“For what?” Sandra asked.

“We’re all going to an afterparty,” Molly answered, avoiding eye contact with her mother.

Sandra leaned against the marble counter, feeling lightheaded, a side effect of her breakfast.

“Whose afterparty?”

“Probably some guy she’s fucking,” Emily said under her breath.

Molly shot Emily a glare.

“Jealous?” she asked.

“Stop it!” Sandra shouted, directing her anger toward Emily. Turning back to her youngest daughter, she asked, “But what about *our* party?”

Molly sighed and rolled her eyes.

Just as she was about to verbalize her frustration, the front door swung open. Seconds later, Trager Collins stumbled into the kitchen. His designer blue shirt was unbuttoned down to his stomach, his white tank top drenched in sweat. His usually coiffed brown locks were anything but.

“Where’s Trip?” he asked breathlessly.

“He’s on his way to work,” Sandra said, her tone sharp.

“What’s wrong with you?” Molly asked, looking up from her phone.

“Turn on the TV,” he barked as he ran into the next room. “It’s all over the news.”

“Hello to you, too,” Emily said.

“Are you coming tonight, Trager?” Sandra asked as she followed him.

Emily and Molly joined them in the family room, where they found Trager screaming at the 85-inch OLED screen as if it were a disobedient employee. “Input! Input!” he shouted, mashing buttons on a remote that controlled the motorized drapes, not the television. Despite owning a home theater system that cost more than most people’s college tuition, no one in the family actually knew how to turn it on.

“Give it here,” Emily yanked the remote from his hands.

“You’re not doing it right,” Molly shouted. “You have to hit input and then power.”

“No, it’s power and then input,” Emily countered.

Finally, somehow, they turned on the television.

On the screen, a bottle-blonde anchor was trying to maintain her ‘calm but concerned’ face while reading a teleprompter that was clearly malfunctioning. “Breaking news,” she said, “Reports of multiple cases of individuals infected with a disease that leads to uncontrollable violence and the insatiable desire to consume human flesh.”

“What show is this?” Sandra asked before sipping her drink.

“This is the news, mother,” Emily said, stepping closer to the television.

“The disease is highly contagious and transmitted by human saliva. The public has been instructed to stay indoors and report any infected individuals to the nearest CDC office, which is being mobilized in several of the states’ major cities.”

“Oh my goodness,” Sandra said, collapsing onto the off-white sofa, careful not to spill her drink. “I can’t cancel the party. The ice sculpture is already en route. Do you know how hard it is to get a refund on a swan?”

“I’ve got to get out of here,” Emily frantically began typing on her cellphone.

“You’re not going anywhere,” Sandra demanded. “You said you’d help with the party tonight!”

“This has to be a joke. It’s AI,” Molly suggested.

“It’s not,” Trager explained. “I saw one of them, one of the infected people. They were crazy and running down the street.”

“Who are you calling?” Sandra asked Emily.

“Gabrielle,” she said.

“Who’s that?”

“Her dad has a PJ and can get me out of here,” Emily said, proving that while she despised her family’s wealth, she had no moral objection to utilizing the carbon-heavy luxury travel of others. Especially during an apocalypse.

“*Girl* it is,” Molly jeered.

“Shut up!” Emily took her frustrations out on her iPhone as she tried calling Gabrielle again.

Before Molly could defend herself, Trip burst through the front door.

“Sandra!”

“In here,” she called out as she struggled to stand up.

He rushed into the room, his blazer ripped and covered in dirt. His lip was bleeding.

“Oh, good, you’re all here,” he said, crumpling over, resting his hands on his thighs while catching his breath.

“Daddy!” Molly shrieked, rushing to embrace her father with the frantic, performative love of a child whose credit card had recently been declined. Emily scoffed at the display, and Molly, without breaking the hug, flipped her the bird over their father’s shoulder.

Trip ignored them, too focused on his own grievance.

“I’m suing Cho,” he announced, smoothing his disheveled Gucci lapel. “First, he crashed his Mercedes into a telephone pole, and then, when I went to check on him, the lunatic bit me! He’s insane.”

He held up his arm. A jagged, weeping bite mark ruined the line of his shirt. The family didn’t gasp in horror; they recoiled in collective disgust. In the Collins household, bodily fluids were considered a breach of etiquette.

“What’s wrong?” he asked.

Trager pointed to the television. Trip watched in disbelief.

He stared at the carnage on the screen—burning cities, screaming crowds—and shook his head with the confidence of a man who had never been told ‘no.’

“It’s a hoax,” he declared. “It’s election year nonsense. Turn it off.”

“It’s real, Trip,” Sandra said, eyeing the blood dripping onto her Persian rug. “We need to get you to a hospital. Preferably before the guests arrive.”

“Breaking news,” the blonde newscaster announced, “the governor of California has issued a state of emergency.”

“This is getting serious,” Trager said as he scrolled through X.

Trip groaned as he rubbed his arm. His complexion had turned a sickly white.

“You’re not looking great, Dad,” Emily said, showing genuine concern.

“That fucking Cho,” Trip said as he sat down on the cream sofa.

“Someone get him a towel,” Sandra demanded, but no one moved. “He’s getting blood everywhere!”

Trip’s body jerked forward, his cheeks expanding as bile rose from his gut.

“Honey,” Sandra said softly, “are you okay?”

He managed to swallow it down, but his body heaved again, this time a mixture of blood and bile spewed from his lips, spraying the family and, more tragically, the vintage cream upholstery.

“What the fuck, Daddy!” Molly shrieked, her baby tee splattered with blood.

“Trip!” Sandy shouted. “Consuela just left!”

Trip attempted to stand but stumbled forward, crashing into the marble block that served as the coffee table. His body sprawled out on top of the slab, convulsing. Gargling sounds that evolved into guttural grunts came from within him.

“What’s happening?” Molly asked.

“He’s having a reaction,” Sandra insisted, backing away. “I told him that tartare looked suspicious last night.”

“He’s drunk,” Molly countered.

“It’s 10 in the morning,” Emily said.

Molly looked at their mother as if saying, *case in point*.

“He’s turning into one of them,” Trager corrected, hiding behind a wingback chair.

“I can’t believe this is happening!” Sandra attempted to cry, channeling her limited experience as a daytime soap opera background actor.

While her family fell apart, Emily snapped into control.

“We need to get him into the garage,” she said, already reaching for her father.

“Be careful,” Sandra warned, just as Trip growled and lunged toward his daughter.

Emily screamed and stumbled backward, crashing into the fireplace. Trip crawled over the coffee table, dragging his lower body with a lack of dignity that would have horrified his PR team. He glared at Emily, his perfectly straight, veneered teeth stained with blood. She used her hands to shield her face, but right before Trip went in for the kill, Molly knocked him over the head with a heavy and expensive vase.

They all froze in place, their heaving chests the only movement. In the background, the newscaster began screaming as the weatherman bit into her neck. But none of them were listening. They were focused on the chaos unfolding in their living room.

“That was a Ming dynasty replica, Molly!” Sandra scolded. “I haven’t even had it appraised yet!”

“He was going to kill her,” Molly defended herself.

The sisters shared a glance, a silent acknowledgement of appreciation for the first time in their lives.

“Put him in the garage,” Trager shouted. “Before he comes to.”

“I’m not touching him,” Molly said, scrunching her nose up.

“Emily,” Sandra said, “help your uncle get your daddy out of here.”

Emily rolled her eyes as she stood up and helped Trager drag her father’s unconscious body into the garage.

“We can’t just leave him in there.”

“Well, what do you suggest we do, Molly?” Sandy attempted to call Consuela, the family’s long-time maid, but was only getting a busy tone. “Dammit,” she said.

“We should take him to the nearest CDC facility,” Trager said as he and Emily reentered the room.

“I’m not riding in the car with that thing.” Emily attempted to contact Gabriella again.

“That thing is your father,” Sandra said. “Show some respect.” She paced for a moment. “I think we should just wait it out. He’s probably just... he needs some water and a solid twelve hours of sleep.”

Sandra poked at her phone screen.

“Why isn’t she answering?” she said as she pouted.

“The phones are probably down,” Emily said. *I’m surrounded by idiots*, she thought.

“Well, I’m not waiting for him to try to kill me,” Molly said.

She turned to walk away, but Sandra stopped her.

“You’re not going anywhere,” she said, her voice stern. “We need to stick together.”

“She’s right,” Trager said, glaring at the television. A standby message stared back at him.

A loud thud came from the garage. Sandra and Trager exchanged glances.

“What was that?” Molly asked.

Another thud, this time louder.

“Is he awake?” Sandra asked, still looking at Trager.

Another thud. A thin crack ripped down the front of the door.

“What if he gets out?” Emily backed away from the garage door.

“He’s not going to-”

But before Trager could finish, the garage door exploded outward. Trip burst through and lunged for his family. They screamed and ran in different directions. Molly dashed up the steps, two at a time. Sandra and Trager leaped behind the sofa, leaving Emily to fend for herself. Trip focused on her and began to stalk toward her. She ran past him into the kitchen and darted behind the large island.

She grabbed a butcher knife from a wooden block on the counter. She waved it toward him, threatening.

“Why’s he obsessed with me?” she shouted.

Unfazed by the knife, she began to toss kitchen objects at him, some of which he dodged. The items that hit him barely slowed him down. As he got closer, she grabbed a hand-hammered, imported French copper pot, an object that had literally never been touched by a member of the family before this moment. She hurled it at her father’s head. It knocked him back and slowed him down, just enough so that she could escape and run back into the family room.

“Don’t bring him in here!” Sandy shouted, clinging to Trager.

Emily joined her family behind the sofa. Zombie Trip spun around, searching. His wild eyes landed on his terrified family. He began to limp toward them, his body moving like a puppet that had lost a few of its strings.

Sandra, Trager, and Emily backed themselves into the corner of the room and fell into a lump of shaking limbs. Trip pounced on top of the sofa and growled, saliva dripping from his mouth. Just as he was about to go in for the kill, two gunshots rang out, striking Trip in the back. The bullets pierced through his body, exiting through his heart. He stood motionless on the sofa for a moment before falling backward, dead, adding another stain to the rug.

Trager was the first to lift his head over the back of the sofa. Molly stood across the room, her limited edition, Swarovski-encrusted pink Glock still raised in her shaking hands. It was the first time she had ever used it for anything other than to impress her ex-boyfriend.

“Did I kill him?” Molly asked, her voice trembling.

Sandra slowly stood up. She saw Molly first and then saw Trip’s body on the ground, bleeding out. She screamed, not necessarily because her husband was dead, but because she realized she was now a widow hosting a party without a host. It was a logistical nightmare.

Trager stepped from behind the sofa and approached Molly. She swung the gun toward him. He lifted his hands defensively.

“It’s okay,” he said. “You did the right thing.”

Molly slowly lowered the gun, her arms trembling. Not from trauma, but from a sudden realization. As she stared at her father’s cooling corpse, a single word formed in her mind: *Inheritance*. It was a soothing word that instantly dissolved any trace of guilt.

Trager cautiously approached her and tried to remove the gun from her damp hand, but she yanked it away. She slipped it into her back pocket.

Growing tired of Sandra’s screaming, Emily slapped her across the face, silencing her and snapping her back into reality. It also released a bit of pent-up resentment.

“Why’d you hit me?” Sandy gasped, clutching her cheek. “I just had fillers put in on Thursday! You could’ve displaced the Juvederm!”

Ignoring her mother, Emily took center stage. The open-concept floor plan, designed to facilitate ‘family togetherness,’ was now a war room.

“We need to come up with a plan,” she said as she paced back and forth, thinking. “We could leave and try to go for help. Maybe check with the neighbors?”

“Or we can stay here and wait for this all to blow over,” Sandra said, too hopeful.

“This isn’t going to blow over,” Trager said as he ran his fingers through his hair.

That’s when Sandra noticed the trails of blood running down his arm.

“You’re bleeding,” she said. Her manicured fingers trembled as she pointed at him.

Trager brushed the blood away, smearing it across his arm.

“It’s just a scratch,” he said, improvising wildly. He looked at each of the women staring at him. He knew he hadn’t been bitten, but he also knew they wouldn’t believe him, no matter what. “It’s just a scratch,” he said, another failed attempt at convincing anyone in the room.

“You gotta go,” Molly said.

“What?” Trager laughed. “I’m not going out there. Are you crazy?”

“You can’t stay here,” Emily said.

For the first time, the Collins women were in total alignment. They surrounded him not like lionesses, but like a hostile board of directors voting to oust a CEO who had become a liability.

“You all need me,” he said. “I can protect you.”

“I think we’ve got it handled,” Molly said confidently.

They backed him into the front door.

“You’re going to regret this,” he said.

He fumbled with the door handle and pulled it open.

“Please,” he pleaded one last time.

Molly stepped forward, placing her hand on the gun in her back pocket. With the other hand, she pushed her uncle out the front door, slamming it behind him.

The women looked out the window at Trager. They watched as he stood in the driveway for a moment, looking around, scratching his head. As he started walking away, suddenly, from the left came their neighbor, Paula Love, wearing a black Prada dress—a garment Sandra instantly coveted and was convinced she would look better in. Paula leaped on him and began ripping at his throat with her teeth. Trager screamed, but his screams turned to wet gurgles as Paula ripped out his voice box, effectively ending the debate about whether or not he had been bitten.

Paula, satisfied, took off in a half jog, her broken foot dragging behind her.

“We need to barricade the doors,” Emily said, doing the mental calculus of how long a hollow-core interior door could hold back a man fueled by rage and a viral pathogen.

“We can use the outdoor patio table,” Molly suggested. “It weighs a ton. I know because I tried to move it for a selfie lighting angle last week and almost broke a nail.”

She tossed her gun down on the table near the front door, so casually, like it was a pair of keys.

“Absolutely not,” Sandra snapped, horrified. “That is hand-forged iron from a boutique in Milan. You will scratch the patina!”

Emily stared at her mother with the flat, dead-eyed look of someone who was already composing the therapy session she would need if she survived.

“Mom. The world is ending. The table is not the priority.”

“Fine,” Sandra huffed, crossing her arms.

The extraction of the table was less a tactical maneuver and more a symphony of complaints. They were halfway across the lawn, sweating through their designer clothes and risking three separate manicures, when a figure crashed through the hedge.

Sandra gasped, her hand flying to her throat.

“Who’s that?” Emily asked.

“It’s Justin,” Sandy said, too excitedly.

The 22-year-old pool boy was a fitness model she had spent the entire summer aggressively ‘supervising’ and flirting with from her chaise lounge.

For a fleeting, delusional second, she thought he had finally come to sweep her away. But as he stumbled closer, her excitement curdled into critique. Justin had let himself go. His perfectly sculpted torso—usually oiled to a shimmer—was caked in mud and gore. His eyes were bloodshot and wild. His jaw hung loose and was missing several teeth. It was a serious lapse in personal grooming that Sandra found very unattractive.

Justin lunged. The women scattered like startled gazelles in couture. Sandra and Molly, displaying the ruthless survival instincts of seasoned social climbers, bolted for the French doors, slamming them shut and effectively voting Emily off the island.

Emily made a sharp left instead of a right, boxing herself in against the deep end of the infinity pool. Justin set his targets on her, inching closer.

She stumbled backward, her heels sinking into the turf, and collapsed onto a teak chaise lounge—an Italian import that was aesthetically stunning but spatially hostile.

Justin leaped, snarling. Emily acted on pure instinct. Specifically, the muscle memory from three years of Pilates. She planted her Gucci loafers on his muddy chest, engaged her core, and extended her legs with a force that would have made her instructor proud. Justin flew backward, hitting the water with a splash that ruined the pH balance instantly.

“Let me in!” Emily screamed, racing back toward the house. She reached the doors, tugging at the locked handles.

“No,” Molly refused, her face a mask of cold, hygienic logic. “You’ve been bitten.”

“No, I haven’t, you bitch!”

“Emily!” Sandra shouted, scandalized. “Language! We are being hunted, but we are not trash!” She shook her head.

Justin continued to thrash about in the water, getting closer to the pool edge.

“I swear I’m fine,” Emily begged, glancing back at the approaching waterlogged model. “Please, Molly! He’s coming.”

“Molly,” Sandra said, “let your sister in.”

Molly shrugged her shoulders and turned her back. Sandra turned away, ashamed of her lack of motherly instinct. Or maybe it was just the Vicodin.

“Fuck you!” Emily screamed as she disappeared from view, sprinting around the side of the house.

Molly turned her focus to her mother, who was helping herself to a heavy pour in the kitchen.

“You and Emily really need to stop fighting so much,” Sandra said as she sipped her third morning cocktail. “It ruins the vibe.”

An enraged and bloodthirsty Justin began banging his head against the triple-paned, hurricane-proof glass imported from Germany. Sandra dropped her glass; it shattered on the counter. He banged his head one last time, shattering the door.

Sandra and Molly backed away. He tripped over the doorframe, falling into the shards. He scrambled to his feet and lunged for them, but the kitchen island stopped him, proving to be a good investment.

The front door swung open. It was Emily. In a swift motion, she grabbed the pistol, aimed, and fired. The bullet struck Justin right in the forehead. He toppled over, headfirst, dead.

Sandra rushed to cling to her eldest daughter, weeping with maternal pride.

“I knew those skeet shooting lessons at the club would pay off! It was worth every penny!”

Molly pretended not to be impressed.

“That’s it,” Emily announced. “We’re not staying here.”

She slammed the door shut behind her, locking it. She walked over to the console table and swiped the keys to the G-Wagon.

“But where will we go?” Sandy asked, her voice trembling. “The Four Seasons is probably fully booked!”

“Anywhere but here,” Emily said, heading for the garage. She stopped and looked back at her mother and sister. “You can stay and wait for the next zombie to show up, or you can come with me.”

Molly and Sandy exchanged a glance of pure, terrifying clarity: they collectively didn’t know how to pump their own gas. They scrambled after her, clutching their phones like life preservers.

They piled into the SUV. Emily engaged the child locks, mostly for Sandra. They waited impatiently for the garage door to open.

“Oh, shit,” Molly said, her eyes wide, looking at the passenger side mirror.

Standing in their way was Trager, fully turned.

“Hold on,” Emily said, jamming the car into reverse.

She slammed on the gas, knocking Trager down. His body thumped against the undercarriage. Emily peeled out of the driveway, taking out a line of prize-winning hydrangeas that Sandra had spent three years micro-managing.

They rushed toward the city, expecting safety. Instead, they found the end of the world. Buildings were on fire. Expensive cars crumpled into the sides of buildings. The streets were a battlefield of fire, gore, and the kind of frantic, intimate violence usually reserved for Black Friday sales. Neighbors were tearing into neighbors with a lack of table manners that was frankly appalling. It was absolute carnage.

Sandra groaned from the backseat, gazing out at the burning skyline. “Do you think I should cancel the party?”

Brought granola bars and bagels with me. Had a break after every single block. Took approx 5 minutes breaks for the first 4 blocks then 10 minutes for the last few. Keep in mind that they have to do a security check when going back into the exam room every single time. 

I felt that I had good concentration throughout the exam. It felt exactly like the recent NBMEs and Free 120s. First 2 blocks felt very easy, the rest I flagged approx 15-20 per block - these were questions where I was stuck between 2. There were 2 drug ad questions, couple of ethics questions in every block. I couldn’t guess which questions would be experimental because they all felt relatively similar. Walked out of the exam feeling okay. 

Got my result on the 31st. Super happy with my result, even if I couldn’t reach 260, given my practise scores and the fact that I was working full time I’m thrilled with 257.

**4 Things I didn’t do but wished I had:**

1. All CMS forms 
2. Uworld incorrects 
3. Divine intervention podcasts must listen list 
4. Consistent anki 

**Study method breakdown:**

Initially started studying mid April by doing 40Q tutored, untimed, system wise blocks mainly on the weekends and any time off from work. 

Started doing Anki from Anking deck, wasn’t able to keep up very well due to work.

From July I was more consistent with Anki and uworld.

I was hoping to take the exam September 1st in order to apply for the 2026 match.

At the end of August I was 80% done with Uworld and I took my first NBME, where I scored 236. I wasn’t very disappointment with this for a baseline score, but I wasn’t close to my goal score which was 260. 

Once I realised I wasn’t going to apply for the current match cycle, I took a break from studying as I was burning out. Also, I was working in a busy emergency department and I had absolutely no energy after work or even on the weekends. In September I tried to just do CMS forms and Uworld incorrects - I did not get through most of my incorrects. Also stopped doing Anki regularly at this time.

I booked my exam mid October - this was important for me because I needed a concrete date to plan around. Luckily I was able to get 2 weeks of annual leave all together which really helped. 

Majority of my self assessments were taken in November. I could see a slow upward trend which was very motivating.

I spent a lot of time reviewing the NBMEs - it took 1 whole day for me to get through reviewing an exam - approx 3 hours per block. I would write notes on why I got every question wrong and categorise them. ChatGPT was very useful for this - if any NBME explanation didn’t make sense I would copy the question into ChatGPT and ask it to breakdown the explanation - it would provide a much better explanation than NBME. 

As you go through the NBMEs you realise there are topics they love to test  e.g. immunodeficiencies, fungal skin infections, neurocutaneous disorders. I would revise these before every NBME and I think that was very helpful. 

I also noted that my performance would decline in the later blocks, indicating a lack of stamina. I think the only way to help with this Is practising exams in exam conditions. I took every single NBME/UWSA in timed exam conditions with break times of approx 5-10 minutes, except for my first NBME which I took self paced.

I tried to listen to divine intervention whilst driving to work but I found it extremely difficult to retain any information from the podcasts. I watched the psychiatry, padeiatric and OBGYN shelf review videos but unfortunately did not have time for the medicine review videos.

I completed the ethics section from AMBOSS but did not find it to be specifically helpful. I did not have time to complete the biostats section from AMBOSS. 

I found the CMS forms very helpful. Scored approx 78-80% on all forms that I took. I did all the medicine forms, 2 FM,  2 OBGYN, 1 EM, 1 paediatric form. Highly recommend these for getting into the NBME mindset. 

I personally found that my emotional / stress state had a major impact on my scores. NBME 14 at the start of my 2 week dedicated, I scored the lowest of all my practise exams - I attribute this to extreme tiredness after just having had multiple on call shifts. It was a massive blow to my confidence and I was really considering moving my exam. When I was reviewing my exam I found that I had made a lot of dumb mistakes - it was a test taking issue, not a knowledge gap issue. I took NBME 15 a few days later and scored 251 - this gave me the boost I needed to keep my exam date. UWSA2 again lowered my confidence - but again I was super stressed taking the exam because I had heard it was the most representative and I hadn’t done uworld questions in a long time. Taking the free120s the same day was extremely tiring, but in my opinion an essential part of my dedicated period - knowing that I had done the length of the exam 2 times before the real day was reassuring.

My NBME 16, and new free 120 results were in the range of where I wanted to score. I was hoping for 260 but I would have been happy with 250+.

I'm curious what did it for everyone else. I think for me it was a combination of small things. Finally got some real curtains instead of those cheap blinds.

Started actually using coasters and got a little bar cart setup with a cocktail maker and some nicer glasses instead of just drinking out of whatever was clean. But honestly? The thing that really made the biggest difference was getting some actual art on the walls. Not posters, not prints from Target - actual framed pieces that meant something.

Sitara Stories #1 
-----


Part 1: The Boy Who Painted Silence

There was a young man named Elias. To the outside world, he was a creature of logic and code. He worked in IT, spending his days debugging complex systems and staring at screens filled with syntax that governed machines. He was good at it because it was predictable; code didn’t yell, and code didn’t lie. But inside, Elias was a storm of colors and melodies.
His childhood had been a landscape of broken glass. He grew up in a home where arguments were the background noise of every dinner. He was the invisible child, hiding in the corner of his room with headphones on, trying to drown out the shouting downstairs. He was constantly told he wasn't tough enough, that his sensitivity was a weakness. To survive, he built a wall.
But behind that wall, he created. When the world got too loud, he would pick up a paintbrush or his digital tablet. He poured his pain into abstract art—swirls of dark blues turning into hopeful golds. When painting wasn't enough, he turned to music. He would mix lo-fi beats with the sound of rain, creating the kind of safe atmosphere he never had as a kid. He was a gentle soul who had walked through fire, carrying scars that made him quiet, observant, and deeply appreciative of peace.

Part 2: The Girl Who Stitched Her Armor
Then, there was Aksha. If Elias was the quiet moon, Aksha was the vibrant sun trying to break through the clouds. She was a fashion student with an eye for beauty. She could look at a piece of plain fabric and imagine a gown fit for royalty. She dreamed of making her mark in the fashion industry, creating clothes that made people feel powerful.
But her love for ""princess treatment""—her desire to be cherished and spoiled—wasn't born out of vanity. It was a response to a childhood where she often felt like a burden. She had grown up moving from place to place, never having a stable ground, always feeling like she had to be the ""strong one"" who didn't need anything. She had seen relationships fail and people leave.
Because of this, she cherished the simple comforts: Netflix, a warm blanket, and good food. She wanted to experience life to the fullest because she knew how fragile it was. She wanted a partner who would finally let her put her heavy armor down and just be soft. She carried a sadness in her eyes that she covered with stylish sunglasses, waiting for someone who would bother to look behind the lenses.

Part 3: The Melody and the Muse
(From Elias’s Perspective)
It was a Tuesday evening, but the city felt suffocating. The hum of the servers at work was still buzzing in my ears. I needed out. I drove about thirty minutes out of town to a spot I knew—a small, grassy hill that overlooked the highway but was far enough away that the cars looked like silent toys.
I had my portable synthesizer and a notebook with me. I wasn't trying to make a hit song; I was just trying to find a chord that matched the color of the sunset. I sat down on a wooden bench, the wood rough against my fingers, and closed my eyes, letting the wind hit my face.
That’s when I heard a rustle.
I opened my eyes and saw a small, calico kitten. It looked scruffy, a bit dirty, and very cautious. It was sniffing near a bush, its tail twitching with anxiety.
""Hey there, little one,"" I whispered, not wanting to scare it.
""I don't think he likes the noise of the wind.""
The voice came from my left. I turned around, startled. I hadn't realized anyone else was there. Sitting on the other end of the long bench, wrapped in a thick, stylish beige coat with a sketchbook on her lap, was a girl. She was looking at the cat, not at me.
That was the first time I saw Aksha. She looked like she had stepped out of a magazine, yet she looked just as tired as I felt.

Part 4: The Conversation
I took my headphones off completely and rested them on my neck. ""You think so?"" I asked, looking back at the kitten. ""He looks like he's looking for cover.""
She closed her sketchbook slowly. ""Maybe he's just lonely. Animals cover it up better than humans do.""
Her words felt heavy, like they carried a weight only I could understand. I reached into my bag. ""I have a sandwich. Do you think he'd eat paneer?""
She smiled then, and it changed her whole face. ""If he's a street cat, he'll eat anything. Give it a try.""
I tore off a small piece of paneer and tossed it gently toward the bush. The kitten flinched, stared at us with wide eyes, and then darted forward to gobble it up.
""He trusts you,"" she said, shifting slightly to face me. ""That's rare.""
""I think he's just desperate,"" I replied. ""I'm Elias, by the way.""
""Aksha,"" she said. She gestured to my synthesizer. ""You're a musician?""
""I work in IT, actually,"" I laughed nervously. ""This... this is just how I keep my head straight. Coping mechanism, I guess. What about you? I see a sketchbook.""
""Fashion student,"" she said, her eyes lighting up a bit. ""I design things. It’s my escape. When I'm drawing, I can control the outcome. Unlike real life.""
I nodded, feeling that statement hit home. ""I get that. In real life, things just... happen to you. In art, you make them happen. I grew up in a house where I didn't have much control. So now, I like to create worlds where nothing hurts.""
Aksha looked at me, really looked at me, for a long moment. ""I know that feeling. I grew up feeling like I was always packing a bag, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. That’s why I love just... existing. You know? Watching movies, eating good food. Just being safe.""
""Being treated like a princess?"" I ventured, hoping I wasn't overstepping.
She laughed, a genuine, warm sound. ""Exactly. Is that too much to ask? To just want someone to hold the door and make me feel like I’m not invisible?""
""No,"" I said softly. ""I don't think that's too much at all. I think that's what everyone deserves. Especially people who have seen the dark side of things.""
The kitten, having finished the paneer, slowly walked up to the bench. It looked at me, then at Aksha, and surprisingly, it jumped up right between us. It curled into a ball, purring loudly.
""Look at that,"" Aksha whispered. ""He chose us.""
""Maybe he knows we're both a little broken,"" I said, reaching out to stroke the cat's head. My hand brushed against Aksha’s hand as she reached out too. Neither of us pulled away.
""You have paint on your finger,"" she noted, looking at my hand.
""And you have charcoal on your cuff,"" I pointed out.
We both laughed. The tension of the day, the weight of our pasts, seemed to dissolve in the cool evening air.
""You know,"" Aksha said, her voice softer now. ""I usually come here to be alone. But... I'm glad I wasn't alone today.""
""Me too,"" I said, my heart beating a little faster. ""Do you... maybe want to get coffee sometime? Or I could show you some of my art? I think I could use a fashion expert's opinion on my color palettes.""
She smiled, and this time it was a smile full of hope. ""I'd love that, Elias. But only if you promise to play me whatever song you were working on just now.""
""Deal,"" I said.

Part 5: The Masterpiece
(Narrator)
That meeting on the hill was not just a coincidence; it was the beginning of a healing journey. They didn't just walk away that day; they took the kitten home, naming him ""Lucky.""
In the months that followed, Elias and Aksha became inseparable. Elias found that Aksha was the muse he had been writing stories for all along. He treated her with the gentleness of a princess, bringing her flowers not because it was a special occasion, but because it was Tuesday. He sketched her while she watched her shows, capturing her peace on canvas.
Aksha, in turn, pulled Elias out of his shell. She dressed him in clothes that made him feel confident, and she dragged him to festivals and markets, showing him that the world wasn't just loud noise—it was music he hadn't danced to yet.
They shared their trauma, not to dwell on it, but to understand why they were the way they were. They healed each other's inner children. Elias gave Aksha the stability she never had, and Aksha gave Elias the color his life was missing.
Years later, in a house filled with Elias's paintings and Aksha's fabric swatches, with Lucky the cat sleeping on the rug, they realized they didn't need to write fictional stories anymore. Their reality had finally become better than their dreams. They had found their happy ending.

They found him late in the morning, when the sun had already burned the dampness out of the air and left the island exposed and unforgiving. He heard the engine before he saw the boat. At first he thought it was another trick of his imagination, the mind offering hope just to pass the time. Then the sound held. Mechanical. Steady. Real.

James stood slowly. His body protested the movement, stiff and sore in ways he hadn’t noticed until he tried to straighten. He was thinner now. His clothes hung wrong. Salt and sun had done their work. He watched the fishing boat idle closer, watched the men aboard point and speak to each other. When one of them waved, James tried to raise a hand in response, but it was more like lifting a ten ton weight than his hand.  Joy at being rescued was there but the dread of what was to come still gnawed at James from the back of his mind. 

Getting into the boat took more effort than he expected. Hands reached out and steadied him. Someone pressed water into his palm. He drank carefully, the taste grounding him in a way the island never had. As the shoreline pulled away, James felt the strange mix of relief and reluctance that comes when a hard place releases you. The island had shattered his worldview. Leaving it felt like walking away from something unfinished, even though he knew the work was done.

Majuro came back into focus slowly. Noise. Movement. People asking questions all at once. James answered when he could and nodded when he couldn’t. Someone offered him a phone. He stared at it longer than necessary before dialing. When his mother answered, her voice steady and familiar, something inside him finally loosened.

“I’m ok,” he said. It was all he had. Faith didn’t press him. “Are you safe?” She asked. James said yes, though safe felt like the wrong word. Found was closer.  After a short scolding for scaring her she told him she loved him. 

The flight east blurred together. James slept in fragments, waking to half remembered dreams of water and quiet. Each time he opened his eyes, the map on the screen reminded him that he was moving toward something again. Not escape. Not rest. Responsibility. He let the fatigue sit with him instead of fighting it. Being tired felt honest.

Faith met him at the airport without spectacle. She looked at him closely, took in the sunburn, the weight loss, the exhaustion he hadn’t bothered to hide. She didn’t comment. She hugged him and held on until his breathing slowed. In the car she talked through what lay ahead in a calm, even voice. The executor. The meeting. Curtis would be there. James listened and nodded, the city sliding past the windows like it always had.

That night in his father’s apartment, James moved carefully, as if everything were breakable. Papers spread across the table. Coffee left untouched. Faith worked through details with steady hands. James watched her and felt the truth of it settle deeper. Staying wasn’t a moment. It was a pattern. One he was still learning.

When he finally lay down, sleep came heavy and dreamless. Curtis was still there in his thoughts, unresolved and unwelcome. The anger hadn’t left. It waited, quiet but intact. James didn’t try to banish it. He simply refused to let it lead.

Morning came. The meeting waited.

James dressed slowly, joints stiff, mind clearer than it had been in weeks. He followed his mother, not confident, not resolved, but committed to doing what his father would have wanted.",1,1767634538.0,stories,0,1.0,False

A really nice set of matching luggage? We were thrilled. A coffee machine and even got a cocktail maker with a set of shakers and glasses that's gotten way more use than expected. The fun gift that surprised me most was a label maker. I know how that sounds but being able to actually organize our pantry and storage bins properly has been oddly satisfying in a way I never would've predicted.

I'm currently still stuck in Amsterdam after our fourth rebooked flight was cancelled tonight. Nevertheless, I thought I would share some details of my genuinely very helpful experience with the in-person rebooking desk today, in case it is helpful to anyone in similar circumstances.

  
Background: my partner and I traveled IAD-AMS overnight on 1/2 January and were supposed to have a two-hour connection to Florence (our final destination) on the morning of Friday 2 January. Flight was cancelled and we were rebooked for Saturday morning (Rebooking 1). Rebooking 1 was cancelled and we were booked for an itinerary with a connection in Rome (Rebooking 2) on Sunday afternoon. We boarded Rebooking 2 and sat on the runway for three hours before it was eventually cancelled. We were then rebooked for an itinerary through Belgrade, which was supposed to depart this morning (Rebooking 3). However, we realized that, due to being on separate reservations (as my partner found out later than I did that they would be able to join me in travelling to the US), they had put us on two different flights to Belgrade, one leaving 30 minutes after the other. We decided that we did not want to be separated; my partner is not a confident English speaker and I was worried about them getting stuck alone in a country where they would not be able to communicate, particularly in the event that one of our flights departed and the other did not (which did actually end up being the case - had we gone with the original itineraries, they would be in Belgrade right now and I would still be in Amsterdam). No option to rebook through the app, website, or helpline, so we decided to get to the airport before the KLM helpdesk opened to request a rebooking that would keep us together. 

We arrived at Schiphol at 5 am, half an hour before the helpdesk was scheduled to open. **For those hoping to do the same, the helpdesk is located in Departures 2, next to Check-in Desk 16, and the line will probably stretch back to Departures 3.** By the time we arrived, the queue already had, conservatively, around 200 people ahead of us. I talked to a couple near the front of the queue who said they had been there since 1 am and had slept on the airport floor. The helpdesk itself did not open until around 6 am. When it did open, there were six workstations staffed by KLM agents, as well as a few other KLM staff with tablets who were walking around and talking to people still in the queue to try to resolve their issues. We ended up waiting a total of six hours and made it to the front of the queue shortly before 11 am. At this point, we were directed to one of the workstations and helped by a very kind and competent KLM employee (I did not catch his name, but he was an older South Asian gentleman), who was able to: 

* join our previously separate bookings so that we cannot be placed on separate flights again;
* put us on a direct flight to Florence (Rebooking 4) for this evening *(note: I had been very worried about the possibility of KLM marking my partner as a no-show, as their flight boarded and closed the gate while we were still in the helpdesk queue, and saying that they had forfeited their right to assistance from the company, but this luckily did not end up being the case)*;
* account for both of our bags (as we were worried that my partner's bag would be loaded onto the flight for Belgrade without them and then get ""stuck"" in Serbia due to their no-show status causing the cancellation of the entire booking) and get them added to our rebooked flight for this evening;
* provide us with physical meal vouchers for the rest of the day.

Unfortunately, Rebooking 4 (our flight to Florence for tonight) was cancelled and we are still waiting for a new rebooking, but at least we have much more peace of mind knowing that we cannot be placed on separate flights and that our bags are accounted for (AirTags show them both still at Schiphol). 

For those who are in a similar situation (**need to rebook or otherwise talk to a human working for KLM** and located **physically close to Schiphol**), I would recommend the following for tomorrow:

* Get to Schiphol as early as you can (preferably before 5 am) and join the queue. Again, it is in Departures 2 near check-in desk 16 (it took us some time to find it, as we had previously been told that it was on the Arrivals level).
* Prepare to wait at least 4-6 hours, if not longer due to all of the additional cancellations today. If you can, grab some water/coffee/food from the kiosk in Departures 3 before you queue up (or, if there are multiple people in your party, have someone leave the queue to get food and drinks). 
* Have a clear ""game plan"" about what you want when you are eventually helped. Be kind but firm, and don't be afraid to ask for what you want from the agents. I was worried that the KLM staff would pick apart the ""mistakes"" I had made (not originally booking on the same reservation as my partner, not just accepting the rebookings they had made for us through Belgrade) and use them as an excuse to wash their hands of responsibility for us, but this could not have been further from how we were actually treated. In my own interaction with the rebooking agent and those I observed while at the helpdesk, the KLM staff seemed capable, understanding, and willing to ""pull strings"" (to the extent possible) to help the passengers they were serving. 
* If you do end up being served, be sure to thank the KLM staff for their hard work! I know it's an incredibly frustrating situation (I am a graduate student and my pockets are aching after paying for four extra nights in a hotel + new clothes + airport/hotel food out of pocket) and I have been frustrated at many points by KLM's response, but the people working at the rebooking desk are genuine miracle workers. I could tell that they were all very stressed, and when I profusely thanked the agent helping us, he almost teared up - I can imagine he has had to deal with a lot of (understandably) frustrated people.

Please feel free to comment or DM if you have any questions, or if you just want to vent. I am also very thankful for the very lovely Brazilian couple just ahead of us in the queue (traveling Sao Paulo-Amsterdam-Dublin, in case either of them happen to be on this sub - hi, and I hope you got the help you needed!) that struck up a conversation with my partner and me, purely to have someone in the same stressful situation who could ""feel my pain"" a bit. I'd be more than happy to play the same role, as sounding board and venting partner, for anyone here who is going through the same thing.

I see a lot of commenters saying that if you are interested in IB, you should be at CBS / NYU over other schools because it is in NYC and you can network more. I am not sure if that is true - I want to hear people's opinion (especially people who went to CBS / NYU). Yes, both of them are strong in IB recruitment, but I do not think there is a clear advantage of being in NYC (compared to other strong IB schools, such as Wharton, Booth or Johnson).

I am not deciding between school;  I just want to help people make a more informed decision. This post is specifically talking about the value of short-term recruiting in IB being in NYC

**Context of my knowledge**

I went to an MBA outside of NYC, and had recruited for banking. This is how IB recruiting works at my school (and I wanted to see if it is the same as at other schools) for the top/bulge-bracket banks:

1. All your leaders at the IB club will tell you NOT to reach out to bankers before official recruitment events
2. Banks come on campus (or virtually) for recruitment events, you speak to bankers, and you send thank-you emails (which they may or may not reply to). Banks (or year 2s representing the banks) are specific about next steps (this is the gateway), e.g., reach out to bankers A, B, C for coffee chats, or reach out to Y2s for ""evaluative"" coffee chats.
3. If you do well for your initial rounds of coffee chats, they will move you on to the next rounds of coffee chats (either they will ask you to reach out to bankers D, E, F, or bankers D, E, F will email you directly).
4. You cannot bypass the ""gateway"" (step 2 and 3), repeat step 3 for the number of coffee chat rounds
5. Towards the end of the year, you have to apply directly on their websites (as a formality) and your career services website (if required).
6. If you pass all the coffee chats, you will get a first-round interview or a super day (depending on how the formal interview process is structured at the bank)

I believe this is how 90% of the banks do it (some smaller EBs might ask for your resume as a screener for coffee chats, mainly because they do not have enough capacity to speak with everyone).

I believe there is minimal self-driven networking process typically for these banks (i.e. you do a cold outreach to bankers to schedule your own coffee chats). It may work for 3% of the time, but these cold outreach coffee chats typically do not lead to structured recruiting.

So, there really is no key networking advantage to being in NYC, other than the fact that if your school is not in NYC, you need to travel down every Friday (or every other day).

I would like to know if other current students or graduates disagree with this or have other opinions. Of course, I acknowledge that because many CBS / NYU students stay in NYC, you have a stronger network going forward, but my focus is on immediate structured recruiting for IB.",0,1767634310.0,MBA,4,0.5,False

I need honest feedback and testing. Italian based now.,"Hi everyone 👋  
I’m a student working with a small team on a platform called **Meentd**, a local platform which we’ve just launched at [**https://meentd.com**](https://meentd.com/) and which is intended for italian market now at the beginning.  
We’re now looking for **early users who are willing to test it and give honest feedback**.

The platform explores a different way of connecting people. Instead of profiles, feeds, or swiping, everything revolves around **queries** — short posts where users clearly state what they want to do or what they’re looking for.

Examples:

* “Anyone up for a coffee or walk?”
* “Looking for a tennis partner”
* “Offering / looking for paid services or work”
* “Searching for or offering accommodation”
* “Travel buddies or local meetups”
* Romantic or non-romantic connections

The core idea is **intent over performance**: connections based on what people want to do, not how they present themselves.

* where do you hesitate or get confused?
* what feels unnecessary, missing, or unclear?
* which possible fixes would you propose?
* does this actually solve a real problem, or not?

Trust and safety are central to the project:

* identity verification
* no bots or fake accounts
* basic moderation and security checks
* designed to feel calm and respectful

This isn’t monetization-driven — it’s a learning project built voluntarily and out of passion and love for people and genuine connections, and feedback matters more to us than growth at this stage.

If you’re open to trying it out and sharing honest thoughts (good or bad), I’d really appreciate it.

I’m writing this in a very genuine way, not looking for money or promotion, just **feedback**.

I’m a student from University of Siena and, together with a friend, I’ve spent the last months building a small platform, called **MEENTD**, that came from a pretty simple feeling: meeting people in real life has somehow become harder, even though we’re constantly online.

The platform works in a very simple way. Instead of profiles, swiping, or endless chats, everything is based on **queries** — short posts where you say what you want to do or what you’re looking for.

For example:

* grabbing a coffee
* finding someone to study or work out with
* meeting new people (friendships or something more)
* offering or looking for small jobs or paid services
* finding or offering accommodation
* travel buddies or local meetups

You post a query, browse others, and connect with people who are interested in the same thing.

We’re starting locally (Siena and Milan) and keeping it small on purpose. The platform is already live, but before pushing it further we really want to hear **honest opinions from other students**, you can test the platform out at [https://meentd.com](https://meentd.com)

* Does this feel useful?
* Would you actually use something like this?
* What feels missing or unnecessary?

There’s no monetization push, it is completely free — this was built out of curiosity and a desire to create something that helps people connect more naturally.

If you’re curious to take a look or want to share your thoughts, I’d genuinely appreciate it.  
Even criticism helps a lot.

During the month of December, my (28m) girlfriend (32f) decided we should move to her mothers 2 family house (upstairs) because my gf’s mother decided she wanted to move to a different state to be with my gf’s sister who has 3 kids. Obviously it was a great decision in our heads because we would paying 200$ more in rent for 2 more bed rooms, fenced yard, driveway, balcony, and pool…. The first day we went to go check out the place I was in awe due to the way they left the place, dirty. Baseboard was literally hanging off the wall because none of the screws were drilled into studs, cracked tile in the kitchen, grease all over the fridge, old food in the cabinets, and so much more…. So after the 3rd day of pretty much cleaning up after my gf’s mom and her alcoholic boyfriend, my girlfriend cries to me from the kitchen to help her kill a bug…. When I arrived I opened the lights and spotted the bug which happened to be a German roach. At this point I was already annoyed from cleaning up after grown adults and now I’m livid because I can’t believe there was roaches in the house.

We called an exterminator to come out for an inspection and low and behold, he found roaches behind the fridge, in the bottom cabinets, and most infuriating of all… in the coffee machine that my gf’s father made coffee for us the first day we arrived…. A dead roach and eggs were literally next to where you put the filter for coffee grounds in. I was absolutely livid finding this out. My gf calls her mother and tells her what we found and magically, my gf’s mother starts remembering that she did find one roach she thought was just a traveler a couple months ago…….

So after everything that happened I decided that we will not be moving into my gf’s mother apartment because I didn’t sign up for this and this is too much stress especially during the holidays. So now my gf’s family are calling me an ungrateful AH because we’re screwing my gf’s mother over on money. Mind you they wanted us to pay for the exterminator and to clean and fix the apartment when we’re just renting the home from my gf’s mother. 

Luckily our apartment we were staying at before allowed us to renew the lease and were able to stay at our current place. Also we got very lucky not bringing any furniture to the “new” place. So my gf’s mom is still demanding money from us for rent even though the official move in date was for January, we decided not to move there a week before January happened. 

How tf did you forget you saw a roach before having us move in… I’m extremely annoyed and I don’t think it’s fair that my girlfriend and I still have to pay one month rent for a place we’re not even moving into because of undisclosed information. 

Edit: my girlfriend hasn’t lived at her mothers house in years, she moved out right after HS. Also, we didn’t even know we wanted to move into the home until 3 weeks before January because that’s when her mother mentioned to us about moving into. Her mother didn’t move to her new place in a different state until a week before Christmas. We took the chance with a minimal window out of trust which backfired heavily

We discussed how he wasn't proactive in communication at all and he hesitantly conceded.

Managed to reschedule and saw him today. When I got there, he was already sat there sipping on his coffee. We were in touch and I told him I was 6 mins away, he could have waited for me. But no biggie - I go order my own. We go to a pub afterwards, he asks if I wanted anything, I said tea because coffee wasn't great, then I sit down. He goes and gets himself a glass and a bottle of water.

I actually don't prefer it when someone pays for me or buys me something but since we had extensively discussed how the date cancelation could have been handled better, in this context, I would imagine he would have the courtesy to at least buy me a coffee. Getting there 5 mins prior and getting his own seems like self-absorbed behavior. Then at the pub as well, I would have bought the girl a tea or even another water while he was getting his own.

It's not that I can't get my own, it's the symbolism behind it. He's also incredibly defensive, retorts with jabs when called out therefore has non-existent de-escalation skills. Has had multiple long term relationships and the last girl ended up being very bitter and resentful towards him and he doesn't seem to know why.

  
My friend says I might be judging him too early and to communicate and give him another chance. I already have and every single time I've communicated a concern, he didn't handle well no matter how tactful I was and I ended up softening to de-escalate and restore peace.

I am struggling with getting a good, smooth extraction no matter what I try. Everytime I were to change how I were to extract it, the extraction is too fast and spurts everywhere 

I have the current baratza encore esp and a breville bambino machine which I use a 54mm bottomless portafilter on as well as a morils tamper with a ripple base and a normcore coffee distributor. I am also using freshly roasted beans (12/29/25).

At first, I bought the wrong version of the baratza encore. I sold that and bought the esp version, however it still extracts too fast even at the lowest setting. I used to have a hand grinder but I felt it to be too cumbersome for my routine that I usually skip it if I didn’t grind it the night before.

I read some posts around here and people say to add washers to the baratza. I added literally all the washers to the grinder and still the espresso extracts too fast. I even added a rubber gasket to the baratza before I put on the plastic one so that the beans don’t go on the outside of the grinder and I replaced the felt on the bottom of the grinder.

I am wondering if it’s my technique, the grinder, my espresso machine OR all of the above which wouldn’t surprise me.

Anyone run into similar issues with this setup? All help and advice is appreciated, thanks!",12,1767633634.0,espresso,40,0.77,False

I want to focus on what I can do to help change that,"It seems I keep ending up at jobs that have a toxic manager,or bosses leading to a toxic work environment. 

It’s sad because I really don’t mind working. I try to be pleasant with customers and keep positive energy. Sadly  the bosses or upper management like to keep people stressed,overworked and underpaid. 

 It seems as though anymore it’s not so much about working hard. It’s like you’re never good enough! and you’re just a number and I think it’s quite sad, that companies don’t value their 
employees. 

I am currently resigning from my current position  due to a toxic manager. This person has caused so many issues. I am must admit I was late a few times due to personal obligations. I made up for it by offering to help in anyway, as far as offering any kind of assistance far as the schedule goes. because I’m sure this was frustrating for this person. 
 
 again I was trying to be reasonable and sincerely sympathetic for any inconvenience or frustration that I may have caused.

I had done my due diligence, making sure that I was more on time. That way I wouldn’t inconvenience anybody and made things more difficult. 

Unfortunately, my manager‘s attitude became worse, although I had done my best to improve my attendance.  Manager was still not happy and became more aggressive towards me. 

Public confrontations became daily thing. customers would be close by,and my manager would belittle me over little things. I work at a 
store.  there are parking lot lights that were said to have timers on them.  due to the time change, they were shutting off an hour early before I left for the night. 

I would be the only worker there and it would be pitched dark outside. I was concerned for three weeks because I couldn’t see outside very well. 

One particular night a customer approaches me!he was wearing  very dark clothing. I did not see him as I was locking up for the night, and he quickly approaches me! I’m a woman btw so I freaked out. Luckily, nothing bad happened to me however, I expressed my concern’s a few times and I was dismissed by my manager, as well as the assistant manager. 

We sell Propane tanks,which are locked up in a metal cage.   the locks on those are terrible!  they are difficult to open when it’s very cold outside. 
Again, I am a woman and I don’t have the strength to open them. Due the bitter cold air which makes them stick. 

I was told to use a lighter and that is a big big safety issue. You’re not supposed to use any type of flame near propane tanks.  I expressed that I felt unsafe doing that and once again, I was easily dismissed.

We have an icebox,that contains ice bags for customers. Well, my manager claims that it’s winter time, people don’t really buy ice that much so the doors would be locked all day. My manager opens in the morning. Everything is supposed to be unlocked for the evening worker, sadly that is not the case.

My manager expected me to unlock the icebox in a dark parking lot that requires a key to unlock it. I expressed that I’m not able to see the little tiny keyhole in the dark. 
  
  My manager, then argued with me and stated that it’s not that big of a deal. I’ve then expressed my safety concerns and I felt it was unsafe!  the ice box is not in an ideal location someone could grab me or rob me, There would be no witnesses! No one to help me, if anything were to happen again I was easily dismissed. 

We have a company that picks up the money from the safe.  one morning shift my manager was in the office.  normally this person would pay attention to the cameras. However the Manager seems to be too busy all of a sudden. 

Well, I’m busy cleaning the coffee maker and the countertops. There’s a new employee there as well.  Suddenly, the new employee alerts me that the people are there to collect the money from the safe. I sign off on the paperwork they collect the money. I continue cleaning.

A few moments later, my manager approaches me making sure I signed off on the paperwork, which I stated I did do my part. soon after my manager mentions about the money in a envelope that they were supposed to pick up and take with them. I wasn’t informed of this, which I expressed and my manager became hostile! there were customers around us hearing this as well! 

I’ve also had learned that my manager bends the rules when they see fit, especially when it comes to their close friends! We do not have a public bathroom and my manager told me that no one could use it besides postal workers. 

  
Managers friends get a pass, regardless I don’t know who my manager knows, because we work opposite shifts for the most part.  Sometimes we’re too busy to have much conversation. 

Well, my manager‘s friends also get deals on certain items. They expect free fuel at times or discounts on demand! knowingly, I don’t have the credentials to price override certain items.  

They’re able to use the bathroom when they see fit! and if I don’t comply fast enough, they give me a hard time! and all they have to do is call my manager. and then they both tag team giving me a hard time of course!  which I find to be very disrespectful. 

I was crying that night in the bathroom because I was so belittled that night by my manager and my manager‘s friend as well. 

My schedule seems to change constantly. I take pictures of the schedule as well, just to protect my myself and I still have difficulties.  My manager will change my expected time without  warning.  I have a Family and I need to know what my schedule will be. 

  My manager claimed it was the App we use on our phones which is convenient.  The App seems to be working just fine. I make sure that it’s up-to-date. Never had any issues before well in the last month. There has been issues three or four times.

My manager accuse me of being late, which I checked my schedule just the night before! all of a sudden it would change making me late for work. I expressed my concerns once again, and my manager would then belittle me and gaslight me. My other coworker gave me some more insight without realizing what was going on.

   My coworker told me  that the manager needed a day off. So changes were made of course, but it takes time on the application to process. not to mention the manager would delay the process as well by not hitting published, which would alert the team as a whole that changes were made. 
 
   We were top store in the district. We had our pictures taken as well. It was a very proud moment for us. Unfortunately, my manager had told everybody from customers, to other managers  as well that they had done all of the work. No recognition  nor appreciation was shown towards the team. 

I had offered to help in many ways such as stock shelves I was denied immediately then the manager would complain how they do all the work and nobody does anything even when I’m cleaning making sure the store is tidy there would be underhanded comments as well.  
“Cleaning again I see, doesn’t look like it needs it”. That’s what the manager stated to me several times, although there were crumbs and fingerprints clearly visible.


On busy days we have a self check out, which definitely is a big help.  one day I asked a customer to walk down to the self check out and I’ll be happy to help assist them. In order to keep the Line moving.  that way we’re not too backed up the store is small by the way.  A particular customer did not want to do that, some customers don’t like the self checkout for whatever reason. 

I couldn’t make that person go to self check out of course my manager clearly had a problem with that and belittled me in front of customers! With their voice raised which was clearly disrespectful.  I repeated calmly, I cannot  make the customers do anything that they don’t want to do. 

My managers response to that was, that person normally goes to the self checkout without any issues. What did I say or do to make that person change their mind like that?

I had a respectful, kind tone. The gentlemen even thanked me for helping him.  The customer expressed to me, I was very kind although it was very busy. The  manager seemed to be expecting some kind of a issue that wasn’t there.


Well, yesterday evening, I made sure to put my resignation letter on their desk. I did all I could do. I am really concerned about my safety. I don’t feel supported by my coworkers in anyway, especially my manager. I’ve learned that I need to have healthier boundaries. I never had a healthy relationship with anyone for the most part.  which I am now getting Therapy for and working on my spirituality as well.

I am not a victim. I’m a survivor and I’m still figuring out what I can do to improve in many areas of my life.  I am a Survivor of DV lost a child as well PTSD is brutal however it helped make me stronger.  

I am an intuitive empath which I recently found out by the way. I feel everything,  however I found books that gave me informative insight on how to cope with this. Well maybe cope isn’t the right word.  Sorry I stumble my words at times 

Finding ways to have this gift, which sometimes feels like such a curse, meditation grounding, centering I embrace myself.  I just feel as though in the world of chaos and darkness, dealing with all of that can be a lot. 

I am a working progress and I know there’s things that I still need to work on maybe getting better knowledge so I know what to look out for when it comes to a toxic work environment. If anyone has any more insight that would be greatly appreciated. I’m not afraid of learning because if I’m not learning, I’m not growing, which means I’m not evolving.

In conclusion, I wish that companies didn’t treat people like a number.  instead I wish that they would treat us like a human being. I remember my mother who was a nurse,  she would be invited to a company picnic or at a very restaurant with her top bosses! 

I understand coworkers are not your friends.  make your money. You’re there to do what you have to do in order to survive.  I understand that very well, however what happened to respect and really  appreciating good employees? 


Thank you for those of you had taken a time to read this.   I hope for the best that’s Al I can do

Takeout, coffee, snacks—she’s almost always the one paying. The issue is that he never reciprocates. He also rarely says thank you. Sometimes there’s no acknowledgment at all.

This isn’t a one-time thing. It’s been going on for a while, and it’s noticeable to everyone. What makes it worse is that he doesn’t seem financially incapable—he just lets her do it. No offer to split. No “I’ll get you next time.” Nothing.

I haven’t said anything directly because I don’t want to stir drama, but it’s getting uncomfortable to watch. Curious what others think, especially if you’ve seen similar dynamics play out.
TLDR: My friend constantly buys food for another friend who never reciprocates or even says thank you. It’s been going on for a while and feels one-sided and exploitative.

But THIS?

This is special.

Suddenly she’s “known for” a short film nobody has heard of?

When last I checked, her IMDb was a barren wasteland. I made a post about it even. 

Now it magically has a role, a project in “filming” AND “actress” as her profession

That’s not organic. That’s somebody excitedly filling out forms. 

The funniest part?

The movie stars Cherdleys.

CHERDLEYS.

The YouTuber.

The comedian your little cousin watches while eating dry cereal.

This isn’t “I’m in Dune 3.”

This is “we filmed this in someone’s garage.”

And yet IMDb presents it like:

“Known for The Hum.”

KNOWN.

FOR.

THE. HUM.

Nobody on earth is known for The Hum.

Not Cherdleys.

Not the writers.

Not even God.

At this point she’s collecting “careers” like Pokémon:

• model (but not on models.com)

• creator (but only when she mentions Vinnie)

• actress (but the film is a ghost no one has seen)

• Maybelline girl (for 0.4 seconds in a slideshow somewhere)

• Rare Beauty campaign (in the same sense that every Sephora employee has been in a Rare Beauty campaign)

Every time you refresh her page she levels up like:

Jillian Goza — Model • Actress • Influencer • Astronaut • Dental Technician • Mermaid • Overseer of the Vinnie Cinematic Universe

This is textbook clout-inflation, and the receipts line up way too cleanly to ignore.

Now sip your coffee and watch IMDb slowly fill up with more self-submitted lore like:

Upcoming — The Hum 2: The Rebrand

Character — Girlfriend (Lead)

1q4rovd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1q4rovd/need_help_advocating_for_myself/,Need help advocating for myself,"So I know this is way overdue but I am being taken advantage of and need help digging myself out of this hole.

Context: I’ve been with this family (dad, kid) for several years while I’ve been in school. It’s always been a part time position (\~20 hours a week) with occasional longer days on school breaks/summer and occasional sleepovers when the dad is out of town. In 2021, I started with $20/hour and moved up to $25/hour by 2023. Not long after that, with increased cost of living, we had a talk about me needing about 30 hours/week of pay/hours ($750/week but $600 after payroll took out taxes) to afford to stay at this job. He wanted me to stay, so he agreed, though he said he didn’t have more hours for me but would pay me what I needed.

There was clearly miscommunication here that I didn’t realize for some time. In my mind, I thought we had raised my hourly or guaranteed hours to reflect what I needed. In his mind, he was paying me more than I was working and was keeping track of all the “unpaid” hours I had to make up for later. lol. When I found out about this, I said absolutely not. I think he got pissed and eventually said that he couldn’t afford to pay me more than I was working, so I said I’d look for another part time job. None of it panned out, courtesy of the horrible job market in America and my school hours. After that, in 2024, I just asked him if we could stop doing payroll and if he could pay me through Venmo. That way, he was spending $150 less a week but I was still getting what I needed, even though it would screw me come tax season. So this is still where I am at. I don’t get paid hourly if I work longer days or if I sleep over (but i do get an extra $100/night) and I’m still making $600/week and with cost of living continuing to increase, it hardy even cuts it anymore. There’s been no update to the contract in all this time and even though he’s not logging unpaid hours, he’s still not paying me hourly. It’s like I’m salaried.

Why haven’t I said anything or found another job until now?

1. he’s a businessman and knows how to use his business speak to talk circles around me, and I have a history of social anxiety and not knowing how to be firm and clear about sticking up for myself. These conversations make me nervous because I’m always out of my depth

, also because I don’t really know the general nanny baseline for things like this and what to ask for. And honestly I just wanted to keep my head down until I graduated.

1. Even though I’m recently graduated and out of school, the US job market is still a clusterfuck and I feel like everyone I know is holding on to the jobs they have for dear life. I apply to so many other part time jobs like coffee shops and never even hear back.
2. the kid. because there’s no wife/mom in the picture, a lot of extra emotional labor has fallen on me with boundaries being crossed, but the kid has emotional and behavioral issues and I feel like I’m the only one who really advocates for them and tries to understand them. The dad is borderline emotionally inept, and will oftentimes walk upstairs and ignore the kid when they’re having an emotional breakdown/tantrum and I’m the one left calming them down and talking to them. The kid has told me some things that truly break my heart (like I’m the only one who cares about them) and I would not feel right abandoning them. I’ve kind of talked to the dad about this and finally demanding putting the kid in therapy, but that’s as far as it’s improved.

1q4role,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4role,Type me plz I don't know for sure what I am,"Hiii I am a 30 year old nonbinary woman, I am working overnights from home in internet/telecom monitoring. I take a few classes at a time and I'm gonna get a bachelor's in software engineering next year.

I grew up homeschooled and I went along with it until I was a teen,  I started slowly planning to leave then  cutting contact with my parents when I moved out because let's just say I realized how toxic the environment was. I had too many questions that I didn't like their answer to, and those questions were not met well I will say. We were kept very isolated but I didn't like that. I'm too curious about the world and about people, too empathetic to think that somehow my family could be better than everyone else.

I'm very logical but I'm also very daydreamy. I have general anxiety and ADHD, mayyybe autistic.
Growing up I was torn between a career in the arts or in the sciences, I love both. I love nature and it's patterns. I ended up going the computer route because I want to be rich one day.

I usually have my head in the clouds. I like to watch commentary YouTube, shop at thrift stores, check out different coffee shops, and I am OBSESSED with my cats. And meteorology. And rocks. 

I have collected a circle of neurodivergent friends and at my partners house we throw a game night every couple of months. Any more frequent is overwhelming for me.

I love D&D but I'm too busy to play a game right now. I played Magic the Gathering for a while but I'm not great at keeping track of everything going on. I also get really stressed out by competitive games. So video games are not as big a hobby of mine as for most of my friends. 

I really should be more physically active. I played sports a little as a kid but I had a hard time ""getting it."" I prefer cooperative activities because I'm a sore loser.

When I learn something new I have a lot of questions pop up in my head and I'm not satisfied until I have all the answers. 

I am scared of people and I have a bad habit of needing to take an edible or have a drink before any social function.

But with people I know and care about I will move heaven and earth to help them out, sometimes I don't know when to stop. I just want people to have help and to like me and to make people feel happy.

I have worked in leadership positions before but at a point I preferred fixing the robots over managing people because robots don't get upset at me for telling them to do their job . A lot of peopling stresses me out.

At work, I don't follow the book as much as I try to do the best I can, efficiently and practically, and I always have suggestions for improvement. If there's a roadblock I will bug the people I need to until the issue is resolved and the job is done.

I have been described as detail oriented and task oriented. I like structure and an end goal. But I need novelty. If it's boring I'm not gonna do it.

I love nature and I love music. If I could describe my vibe it would probably be a nerdy hippy. I like to just vibe. If people don't f with my vibe I don't f with them.

Would it be alright to add Decafeinated  / Caffeinated Coffee Powder to this gel and apply it to my oily hair?

I normally use henna to my hair once a month as hair color and leave for 2 hours, so in lieu of henna attempting to put coffee powder. And it will have a pleasant smell.

Is it better to use Decaffeinated or Caffeinated Coffee Powder?

I have no freakin idea how it managed to get all three wheels airborne but when I checked my security cam I can see it and it has tried climbing up the table leg and gotten itself stuck.

Here's why I still said no.","Had coffee with a VC last month who'd reached out after seeing some of our growth numbers. Nice guy. Smart. Genuinely wanted to help. His pitch was simple. Take $2M, hire aggressively, grow faster, capture more market before competitors do. The opportunity cost of staying small was leaving money on the table.

I listened. I asked questions. And I still said no.

Here's my math. Right now I take home about $31K per month after expenses. I work maybe 35 hours a week. I have no board meetings. No investor updates. No pressure to hit growth targets that would require me to sacrifice profitability. When I want to take a vacation I take a vacation. When I want to try something risky I try it without asking permission.

If I take the money, my salary might stay the same or even go up a bit. But I'd add a boss. I'd add expectations. I'd add a clock ticking toward an exit that might or might not happen. I'd trade certainty for a lottery ticket that statistically probably won't pay off.

The VC wasn't wrong that I could grow faster with capital. He was wrong that faster growth equals better outcome for me specifically. His incentives and my incentives aren't aligned. He needs me to swing for the fences because that's how his fund model works. I need to build something sustainable because that's how my life model works.

I'm not anti-fundraising. It's the right choice for some founders and some businesses. But ""leaving money on the table"" assumes the table I want is the same table he wants. It's not. My table has freedom and sustainability and reasonable hours. His table has a different set of prizes that come with a different set of costs.",4,1767633349.0,SaaS,3,1.0,False

Seeing how the people live over here compared to the U.S is something of a dream; a relaxed fantasy where the pressures of everyday life aren't felt or seen.

People who work in coffee shops seem fulfilled, not needing to convert their off hours into a second income. Their hard exterior can be broken easily with a simple ""Hello"" or ""How are you"" showing that the rejection I feel in the states seem native to that land...

But I return in 8 days. I have no plan. No place to go to, no job lined up, not much more money saved... a little background...

I moved out here to live with my long-distance girlfriend for a while. We have done this for a couple years and wanted to spend more than a week or two at a time together. And it has brought us closer. Being here, though, I had to go through more money than I initially thought. She needed help with her rent, and I was happy to help her how I could. But that was an extra amount I did not account for so now I am scrambling a bit. 

I know everything will work out, I can feel it. I have been here before, slept in my car on the streets of LA, even bounced around on a couple of friends couches...

But I want to do more than this, have more and be more. I am looking for a bit of luck, a little bit of grace when it comes to that. Because I felt like everything was working out and now, I think I am going to be struggling here for the next couple of months. 

I had a great job before I left, in an established profession in SoCal that gave me a bit of notoriety in town. I want to keep that status, meaning I want to work another job where I can wear a suit every day and connect with people who can create a difference in others life.

I guess I am just ranting, seeing if anyone else made a ""mistake"" recently...I guess it's not a mistake because I wouldn't have changed this time I spent in a foreign land with a girl I am in love with.

So...has anyone else felt this? This feeling of immediate uncertainty while knowing after the low the high will come back? Or does this not make any sense?

Then she starts ranting and ask for something in return and asks me to drive to CVS for a gift card. I was like if you actually need something from there I could get it online, and then she pulls out her phone and starts recording saying that “this man from this country asked me for sex on a first date”. “This is why we never date asians”

I took her flowers as I thought it was a real date, but she recorded a video stating that I gave her flowers and that I asked for pussy. Which I did not, she started saying things like ill make this go viral on tiktok.

4-5 hours later I dropped back to baseline. I even had a 30 minute nap. When I woke up, I was feeling insanely tired and couldn't remember anything that I did during the past 4 hours. 

I have exams tomorrow, and I was feeling way too tired to study so in an impulsive fit I took another 400mg of Moda and another cup of coffee about 2 hours ago.

It did not help at all with motivation, procrastination, and impulsivity. Is this the average experience or is Modafinil just not for me?

I’m sure you’ve heard of them. From Mad Cow disease to the stories of hunters seeing deer bash their brains open on rocks, screaming and then dying in the river. It’s always fatal.*

*It’ll cause anxiety, depression, force you to withdraw yourself and put you in a position where you know you’re dying, but the deterioration of your own brain is making that hard for you to really take in and understand. You’re dead before the symptoms start.*

*Doctor Javier Diaz wrote about these diseases. More than once. Often, he would be tracking down leads on the next skinwalker or wendigo case, only to find that it was an elk, a deer, a moose, with a prion disease. He’d take care of it, of course, and kill the beasts and move on. The disappointment, he wrote, was unmeasurable.*

*“I hope that someday I can find one of these creatures and see that they are truly a monster, and not just another diseased soul, begging for release.”*

*If I could talk to him, I’d ask him the following question: Are not all monsters, somehow, diseased, and if you truly found one, would that really be such a success?*

**Part One – The Host**

The field of medical practice was not something I ever took any interest in. I would normally say “particular interest” but in all honesty, there was never any interest in me for the world of medicine and surgery. I did not wish to cut into the body of a man or woman in a desperate and potentially fatal urge to save their lives. No, I preferred to hunt. In years past, I would hunt men on the battlefield. I often remembered the feel of a gun in my hands. I shuddered at the thought. The last time I held a weapon like that, it didn’t end well.

I sighed, standing up from my desk and pacing my office. It was a small building, set in a small town at the border between Salt Lake City and Layton. A border that was getting harder to parse as both cities seemed intent on expanding indefinitely. My office was half-way between a museum to the local legends and a private investigation suite. One wall was filled with maps and photos of sightings and written statements, and one half of the room was set up with stands and displays of creatures like the Bear Lake Monster, Old Briney, and other legends, such as the Werewolves of Provo or the Lizard People who reportedly rule Salt Lake City.

I stopped pacing when a knock rapped on my door, followed by someone ringing my doorbell. “I’m coming,” I said loudly, making my way over to the door. I popped it open, and a young man was on the other side. He looked about twenty-five, maybe younger, and I invited him in.

“You look for weird stuff, right?” The man asked as soon as he sat down across from me at my desk. “Like monsters, cryptids, that kinda thing?” He asked. I nodded.

“Yes. How did you find my services?” I asked. He waved a hand.

“They talk about you on reddit a lot.” He muttered. I arched an eyebrow, curious. “It doesn’t matter, I need your help, I think something replaced my girlfriend.” He let out a long breath, like a demon had been holding him hostage and finally released him when he was able to get that statement free.

“What do you mean?” I asked. He rubbed his hands quickly on his thighs, thinking.

“It’s like that skinwalker thing, you know? People go on a trip to the mountains then come back weird? That happened. She went on a girl’s trip to the hills, some kind of camp thing for her church, and then when she came back, she was just different. She’s always wandering around at night, and I wake up a lot and just find her staring at herself in the mirror.” He shuddered, and then continued, full tilt. “And one time I found her with a knife? Like she was trying to cut herself in her sleep. Sometimes too I’ll wake up to her whispering random statements over and over, like ‘free’ or like ‘let me out’ and it seems corny and a lot of the people I ask on reddit think I’m doing some kind of horror story thing, but I’m not. I’m scared.” He took a breath for the first time since he started. I saw the look in his eyes, the fear, and the sadness. “Can you help?” He asked.

“I can try.” I said, slow. “Let’s start here, what’s your name?” I asked. He nodded, taking another breath.

“Caleb.” He said. “My girlfriend’s name is Aurora.” I nodded, making notes.

“When did you notice these events?” I asked, making a date chart in my journal.

“Two weeks ago, the night after she got back from camp.” He said. “She got up out of bed while I was still up, it was like one in the morning or something, and she just started walking in circles around the room. Her hands were out, like she was blind and trying to feel out the shape of everything.” He looked off into the distance, his eyes unfocused. “I knew not to wake sleepwalkers, so I didn’t do anything, but then it just got weirder. She spent ten days mapping out the whole apartment, then three days ago I found her in the bathroom, staring in the mirror, and then last night she had the knife.” He shuddered.

“Did she hurt herself?” I asked. “Has she had suicidal thoughts before?” He shrugged.

“We’ve talked about our past a lot, and she was depressed when she was younger but any ideations she had were always drug related. She’s told me she could never actually do anything cause she was so scared of getting hurt. And when I found her with the knife, she hadn’t drawn any blood, but it was close.” Caleb hung his head, placing it in his shaking hands. We sat there in silence for a moment, and as the light outside died with the arrival of evenfall, I flicked on my desk lamp. His features came into sharp relief, the contrast of shadows on his pale skin making his cheeks look gaunt and his eyes appear sunken.

“What do you want me to do?” I asked, leaning forwards, placing my notes down. It sounded like a skinwalker, and the excitement of such a find was hard to conceal on my face. I had been hunting for one of these for years and had resigned myself to the truth that these kinds of legends simply didn’t exist. Caleb looked up at me and that small excitement I had felt at finally finding what I had longed for vanished at the sight of the despair written into the lines around his eyes and mouth.

“I want you to save her, sir.” He said, his voice small and pleading. He stood up and sighed, his shoulders heavy. “How much does a consultation cost?” He asked, reaching for his wallet. I held up a hand, motioning for him to stop.

“Nothing. I’ll help you; you don’t have to pay.” My own voice as low, tinged with a gentle sorrow. I knew the pain of losing someone you loved to something you couldn’t understand. Again, I remembered the feel of a gun in my hand, and again I felt the fear of that feeling. That unchecked, unstoppable power. I pushed the thought away, shuddering slightly. “Here’s my number,” I handed him a business card, which he took eagerly. “Call me next time you see her sleepwalking, I’ll be there within the hour.” I said. He slid the card into his wallet and nodded. He left without much of a word, and I watched the light outside my office window die.

“What pain, young love can be.” I muttered to myself as I locked the door to my office and shut down the lights. The room in the back, behind the makeshift museum and my desk, led to a small apartment that came with the property. I sat down on the couch and turned on my record player. I set the needle down gently on the vinyl I had in there already and closed my eyes as the music filled the room. Soon the music moved seamlessly to the back of my mind as I let my thoughts wander.

I could feel it, in the room with me. My Associate. It sat in the dark, like always, black on black, and stayed silent. I let the waves of my own despair pour over me, like water over rocks in a stormy bay. I let them crash against me, and I stayed firm. I didn’t sit and wallow, but the despair was useful for me, kept me awake, and kept me alert. I opened my eyes and let out a gentle breath of air as the room took on a slight chill.

When my phone rang, moments later, the surprise and sudden break from the stillness shook me to my core. I heard the dim and distant sound of my Associate skittering away into the dark, and I answered the call. It was Caleb.

“Doctor, she’s walking.” He said, his voice low. I could hear the panic in it, and was impressed on how he was able to sound almost calm. “Just in circles.” He added.

“I’ll be on my way, send me your address.” I said, standing and grabbing my keys. He muttered something I couldn’t hear, then hung up. A second later, my phone dinged with a text, containing the street address he lived at. It was all the way in Provo, which would be a bit of a drive, but nothing I couldn’t handle.

My car was swift and silent on the highway, which was nearly empty this late at night. I glanced in the rearview mirror and could see the shadowed silhouette of my Associate, who had decided to accompany me as our little meeting had been cut short. It’s small, red eyes glittered from the shadow it sat within. I turned my attention back to the road and focused on staying on track as the waves of sadness broke over me again. My thoughts wandered, and my fingers twitched as the thought of the Eat crossed my mind.

For a brief moment I considered this. If this wasn’t a skinwalker, if Caleb’s girlfriend wasn’t some kind of Navajo witch, were they cursed by the thing I feared so deeply? I tensed for a moment.

“No.” My voice was sterner than intended, and I could feel the waves of despair that flooded me ebb a little as my Associate reeled back in the seat behind me. “Not there.” I muttered. “Not now.” There was a mutter from the shadow, then I was alone in the car again. The moment had passed, and I forced my lingering thoughts to move on from the Eat and focus on what was happening in the here and now, and not one what I had done then.

It took forty-five more minutes to make it to the young couple’s apartment, but when I did, I knew exactly which one I needed to walk up too. It was the only one with its lights still on, and Caleb was standing outside of the open front door, on the second level, leaning over the railing of the small porch. He waved me up, and I obliged. The apartment was small, with the front door leading straight into the main room, which was connected to an open concept kitchen. Combined, this made the opening room quite long, as it ran the entire length of the apartment. To the right was a short hallway, which had three rooms on one side, a wash closet on the other and a single bathroom at the end. The effect made the entire apartment feel like a long, lingering hallway.

A young woman sat, her eyes wide open and unseeing, on the couch at the center of the living room. She, like Caleb, was still dressed in her night clothes and her hair was disheveled. “She’s just been sitting there, for about ten minutes.” Caleb whispered to me.

“Has she reached for a knife yet?” I asked. Caleb shook his head.

“It was almost like she knew you were coming, and whatever was moving her decided to act decidedly more normal today.” He sighed, leaning against the wall by the front door. “Doctor, I don’t know what to do.” I held up a hand.

“Let me work, and we’ll see what we can do. No use in playing with ideas that we aren’t sure will do the job.” I set down the case and pulled out a few choice items, each with a distinct purpose. I shuddered for a moment as my hand passed over a large white plate, about the size of my own face. Why had I brought this? Cautiously, I pulled it free and set it on the coffee table first. I looked up at Aurora’s face, and noticed her eyes were a clear shade of blue. “Have you noticed any discoloration in her eyes?” I asked, pulling out a flashlight and flicking it on.

“No, sir.” Caleb said, shaking his head. “Maybe her eyes get a little red when she wakes up in the morning, but I think they’re just dry.” Carefully, I shone a light into her eyes. I squinted, expecting them to flash red, an indicator that this was a skinwalker. They didn’t. I set the flashlight down and held up the plate. It was blank, white and looked like a featureless mask. I covered her face, careful not to touch her, and waited. When the plate didn’t move, I set it back down and let out a sigh of relief. “What is it?” Caleb asked.

“Well, I don’t know if she’s a skinwalker, normally their eyes are discolored, and glow red or yellow.” I said, pointing to my eyes. “Especially when you flash a light in them. And the mask here was for something else, but rest assured that it was a negative test.” I sighed, leaning back in the chair I was in. “I don’t exactly know what’s going on here, but we’ll get to the bottom of this.” I stood up, packing my things when a thought crossed my mind. “Has she experienced any memory loss or confusion?” I asked. Caleb thought for a moment.

“Not anymore than usual. She’s always had memory problems, she suffered pretty bad head trauma when she was eight, got a nasty gash in the head from a swimming pool accident.” Caleb said.

“What about involuntary muscle movement or bad coordination?” I asked, carefully sitting back down. My heart hammered in my throat as I recalled the numerous times I had been called for a skinwalker, only for it to be an elk or cow infested with a prion disease.

“Other than the sleepwalking, the only other thing I can think of is that she keeps scratching at her skin, especially on her arms and face.” Caleb said. I looked over at the girl, who was still sitting there, silently. Sure enough, her forearms and neck were red. Then she blinked. She looked up, surprised. The expression on her face was equal measures confusion and exhaustion as she woke up, slumping in her seat.

“Caleb?” She asked, sitting up and moving backwards in an attempt to escape my presence. “Who is this guy?” She looked at her boyfriend, worry crossing her face.

“Someone whose here to help with your sleepwalking.” Caleb said, moving to sit next to her, placing an arm around her shoulder and giving her a gentle kiss on the forehead. “I’m worried about you.” I excused myself from their moment, standing to leave as I packed my things. When I reached the door, Aurora’s voice cut through the air.

“Wait,” her voice was small, and afraid. “What did you find?” She asked. I turned, my expression grave.

“Nothing.” I said. “I know that doesn’t assure you, either of you, but as far as I can tell, you aren’t sick.” She seemed to deflate, and Caleb looked up at me, concerned.

“What do you mean?” He asked, standing up and meeting me at the door. “Are you saying she’s fine?” He asked. I sighed, rubbing the bridge of my nose.

“I don’t know, Caleb.” I said at last, exasperated. “I did the checks. She’s not a skinwalker and if she was, you’d have more than just sleepwalking on your hands. She’d be shedding skin, there’d be weird animal sightings. All of it.” I looked over at her. “Aurora, have you seen any strange animals lately?” I asked. She was silent.

“Yes.” She said at last, breaking my concentration. I looked back at her, then moved back to my chair, taking a seat.

“Tell me what you saw.” I implored. Caleb sat next to her, taking her hand. She took a deep breath, then looked up at me.

“It was a few weeks ago, before any of this started.” She looked away, her eyes unfocusing. “I was at work, I’m a vet, and someone brought in their dog.” She opened her hand, revealing a row of small, healed puncture wounds near her wrist. “The animal was sick, its bones were essentially bursting out of its skin and we couldn’t tell why. It was clear the animal wouldn’t survive the night, so we euthanized it. As we were preparing the body for a rabies diagnosis, the body seemed to,” she paused, her eyes glazing over. “It came back to life.” She looked at Caleb, then at me. “Then it bit me.” She held up the wounded hand. “After that I started sleepwalking.” She sighed, leaning back in her seat.

“You never told me this.” Caleb said, gentle. “Why didn’t you tell me?” Aurora shrugged.

“I didn’t think it was important. I assumed it was in death throes or something.”

“Did you get anything back on the rabies test?” I asked, leaning in. Aurora nodded, wiping hair from her face.

“Yeah. It was clean. We were going to dispose of the body with cremation, like the owner wanted, but the body disappeared before it reached the crematorium. It was awful.” She shook her head. “I can’t imagine what that would feel like, to lose your pet, then to hear that it was lost again.” She leaned into Caleb and I stood up, gathering my things again.

“Thank you for your time, both of you.” I tipped my head to Caleb. “I’ll do some independent investigating, but you should set up cameras inside the house, to track if Aurora ends up almost hurting herself again, I’d like to see what the sleepwalking looks like when I do not intervene.” Caleb met me at the door as I turned to leave.

“What’s your plan?” He asked. I looked back at the girl, then opened the door.

“I don’t know what this is. Skinwalkers don’t tend to pose as family pets. I’m going to the clinic tomorrow to see if they have any record of this happening, maybe I can track down the owners and see if they saw anything happen to the dog. My concern,” I lowered my voice, stepping outside and Caleb followed. “My concern is that this is a prion disease, which is uncurable. I hope against hope that this isn’t the truth.” Caleb balked, his skin growing pale and his eyes widening.

“I,” he stopped talking, lost in his thoughts. I frowned and nodded.

“I understand the hesitation. Spend time with her, while you still can, just in case.” And with that, I turned and left, the night swallowing me whole.",2,1767632618.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I have a staunch belief that cooperatives as a means to transition to market socialism is the best strategy for getting us out of capitalism and into a more equitable future (at least in the US). I've essentially dedicated my life to being part of the cooperative movement and I want all of my economic activity to be involved with cooperatives. Housing cooperatives, worker cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, whatever. 

I live in Iowa right now, there's pretty much no cooperatives in the area at all, save for a cooperatively run coffee shop in Ames. So far, I've tried establishing cooperatives here with little success. I had a small housing cooperative for the last three years that didn't pan out, and in that time we started a vending outfit that also didn't pan out. Right now I'm thinking about giving it all another go in a few years, but I can't help but think my time and energy would be better spent in areas that already have an established cooperative presence.

Anyway, my question is this. What's better for the movement of supporting cooperatives? Should someone like me, that has high drive for starting or supporting cooperatives, stay in places that don't have any, and educate people in cooperative culture and start them? Or should I move to somewhere that already has a high density of cooperatives like Berkeley or New York?

Thanks

First post here!

I’m torn between the Mountain Jacket, Hoodorac, and Al’s Anorak and was hoping y’all could help me out.

My primary use is outdoors in northwest Ontario, Canada. I spend a lot of time hiking, fly fishing (steelhead season is frigid), camping (especially those cold mornings by a fire with a cup of coffee), and downhill skiing, often in cold, windy, and variable conditions. Durability, weather protection, and versatility across activities are my main priorities.

1q4r4wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1q4r4wg/coffee_break/,Coffee Break,"The chaotic sights, sounds and smells of the Grand Orbital Station washed over Captain Reginald Hossfelder as he finally exited the docking terminal. He slowly craned his neck to each side, eliciting a pair of satisfying pops. A seven foot tall insectoid Aldinae exited behind him, flinched at sharp sounds and quickly scuttled past on its eight legs. 

‘The one thing they don’t tell you about captaining a merchant vessel’ he thought to himself ‘is how much goddamn paperwork is involved’.

Most of his crew had already finished their duties and left to explore the station or rest in their bunks while he had stayed in his office filling out form after form. But now, as he strode down the avenue lined with shops selling all manner of trinkets was he finally free to rest and-

“Oh Human! I am needing your help if you please!” a voice called out from nearby, eliciting a weary sigh from the captain. 

“Hey, listen pal, I’m not interested in whatever it is you’re selling.” He replied as he turned to see an unusually short and stocky Vulthian in a dingy apron jogging up to him.

Their gray fur was patterned with a series of horizontal creme and black stripes, which only served to make them look even stockier, and included one black stripe directly across their eyes that gave them a striking resemblance to a raccoon. They planted their hands on their knees and took a few heavy breaths as they waved their hand dismissively.

“Nonono, no sale, friend.” He panted. “I have human coffee for you, on house! Brand new! You drink and settle dispute with my brother. Come, please.” Having recovered his breath, he straightened up and gestured for him to follow.

“Well, I suppose a cup of coffee would be alright. Not many places around here serving it.” He mused aloud as he followed the diminutive figure to what appeared to be a diner, wedged tightly between two shops as if it had elbowed its way onto the crowded thoroughfare.

“Exactly my friend!” The Vulthian exclaimed with his ears practically vibrating with excitement. “I am first to have fresh brewed human coffee on station, maybe even in whole sector! Only problem is my brother will not let me serve! He says it no good! But I do research, human coffee is acquired taste! This I know!”

He pushed open the door to the cramped eatery. A bar and a set of stools served as the only seating area, with the rest of the space taken up by an actual kitchen. This was a bit surprising as most eating establishments on orbital stations served exclusively pre-prepared meals that could be served as is or heated with minimal time and effort. This was due to a combination of convenience, safety, and because cooking as an art just didn’t seem to be valued across much of the galaxy. Some species had even abandoned it altogether to subsist entirely on bland nutrient paste and ration bars. Yet here the smell of spices was in the air as steam rose from multiple pots bubbling away behind the counter. Another Vulthian, this one taller and slimmer than the first, looked up from stirring one of the large stew pots. 

“Welcome to… oh Tahnu what are you doing now? My brother, did you literally drag a customer in here to try your disgusting drink?”

“Is good drink! He will try and you will see!” The shorter sibling declared, jabbing a finger in his brother’s direction before turning back to his guest with his best approximation of a smile. ”Please sit and wait, I make fresh pot for you!”

With that he scurried off towards the back, his head the only thing visible as he darted past the row of pots. Hoss shook his head as he watched him go and settled into a stool at the bar, which promptly squeaked in protest. 

The taller sibling made his way around and leaned against the counter opposite the human. “I'm sorry about my brother, he can be real stiff-tailed about things when he gets an idea in his head.”

“I know the type, got a few on my ship that are the same way. Names Hoss by the way. “ He said as he extended a hand across the counter. 

“Larven Malsk” he replied as he clasped the large human hand in both of his own and pulled it up and down. “and this is the Malsk Brother's eatery. The only place where you can get genuine Vulthian Perpetual Stew in both meat and vegetarian.“

“Sounds pretty good, but what made you decide to add coffee to the menu?”

“Ugh, my brother saw the reports about how hard humans fought to get coffee approved for recreational consumption instead of being classified as a medical stimulant. From there he was swept up in a current of videos about coffee’s history and cultural impact for the better part of a day. Ever since he’s been obsessed with serving it.”

“Heh, well I sure hope he learned somethin. I just got one more question.” He leaned forward and spoke softly as the clink and clatter of dishware continued in the back of the small restaurant. “Why does he talk like that? I thought the translator software took care of that sorta thing.”

Larven’s neck scrunched down into his shoulders as his whiskers twitched, the Vulthian equivalent of rolling his eyes. “It would if he’d just install the official update. For the last few years he’s refused to do it. Says ‘that’s how they get you’, and installs the language and grammar libraries himself. The void’s guess is as good as mine as to who ‘they’ are though…”

“FRESH COFFEE!”

The shout from the back startled both of them upright as Tahnu proudly marched out from the kitchen holding a small platter. Upon that platter was a human sized mug with wisps of steam rising from it. He approached the bar next to his brother and stepped up onto some unseen platform before reverently placing his prize before his human guest.

Hoss adjusted his hat and peered down into the surprisingly familiar thick-walled mug that would have looked right at home in any diner back on Earth. He gently blew to part the steam and reveal the rich brown liquid underneath…

Except it wasn’t a rich brown, it was more of a grayish color and partially opaque, revealing small flecks of something floating within and a thin film on top. Worst of all it lacked the typical pungent aroma. For all he could this looked exactly like a mug of piping hot dirty dishwater^(.)

He looked up at his host, Tahnu’s excited and hopeful demeanor only somewhat betrayed as he fidgeted nervously with his apron. Hoss took a deep breath and leaned back as he prepared to deliver the news.

“I’m sorry to tell you this Tahnu, but what you got here ain’t coffee. It don’t smell like coffee, it don’t look like coffee, and I can tell without trying it that it don’t taste like coffee either.”

The poor Vulthian’s features fell with every word, his ears and whiskers drooping lower and lower. Larven, for his part, tried to comfort his brother with a gentle hand on his back.

“However, “ Hoss continued. “it ain’t the end of the road yet. Ifn you’d like, we can take a look round back and see what went wrong.”

Tahnu took a moment to gaze at the mug before he heaved a deep sigh and nodded his head.

“Yes, I would greatly appreciate your assistance.”

The stool squeaked in relief as he rose and followed his host back through the kitchen while his brother stayed behind to mind the counter. Past the pots and racks of spices there was a recently cleared counter that shined noticeably brighter than the rest. Upon that counter was a rack of mugs and a 2 pot coffee grinder and maker that, despite the scratches and dings, was just as lovingly polished as the rest of the area around it.

A whistle escaped his lips as he looked at the setup. “An old school fleet standard ‘Coffee Master’, I got the upgraded 3 pot version sittin in my own mess hall. Where exactly did you manage to pick this up?”

“Ah, local scrapyard. A small human craft was damaged beyond repair in a, how you say ‘holding beer’ incident. I got good deal, only 500 credits!”

“Oh yeah, that sure is something.” Hoss nodded along and rubbed his chin. That was certainly more than it was worth new, much less used from a scrap heap, but considering how scarce human goods could be it was hard to judge. 

He leaned forward and poked and prodded at the various buttons and settings. Everything actually seemed to be in good working order. He slid out the filter compartment that held the grounds and found the reusable filter properly in place, but contained within was a thick, wet, gray sludge.

“Uh Tahnu, can you point me to your coffee beans?”  


“Yes yes! I have good quality beans, very dark!” The Vulthian exclaimed as he opened a cabinet and shoved his whole upper body within. A few grunts of effort later he dragged out a burlap bag nearly half as big as he was.

“Now this was practically free! Everyone too afraid of human food. Too many ingredients, too hard to prepare they say! Bah! They forget that it is hard work that makes great things!” He straightened up proudly and gave the bag a hearty slap.

“Well, you are right about that.”Hoss said as he squatted down and examined the blocky writing. “The problem is that these here are black beans.”

The vulthian shifted his weight and gave a nervous chuckle. “Y-yes, black beans for black coffee! Yes?”

“Nnno” He shook his head as stood back up to his full height. “Now there’s plenty you can do with these.” He began to count off on his fingers. “Black bean fritters, black bean burgers, bean salad, you can boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew, all kinda things. But unfortunately, they do not. make. coffee.”

“Uuuh” Tahnu groaned as he rubbed the space between his drooping ears with both hands. “My brother will never let me hear the end of this.”

“Yeah, I imagine not, but I think I can soften the blow for ya a bit.” Hoss said as he glanced back towards the front of the shop. “That stew out there smells mighty good, and I always have an extra bag of coffee beans on the ship in case we’re out longer than scheduled fore getting back to a human port. So how about we trade a bag of beans for a pot of stew. That should tide you over until you get a proper shipment going. I’ll even throw in a few black bean recipes so they don’t go to waste.”

Tahnu’s ears popped up like a shot. “You would do this for me? Truly?”

“Why not? It’s a big galaxy out there, and we gotta take care of each other. I’d run the shipment myself,  but it’ll be a while until we make the circuit to Earth and back. I’ve a few contacts I can send you that should be arriving back to Earth soon, though. You can arrange your shipment from one of them. Just tell ‘em ol Hoss sent ya and they won’t stiff you too bad.”

Tahnu smiled and thrust a hand up towards the captain. “We have deal!”

He grasped the hand warmly. “That we do.”

# What is Google Stitch?

Google Stitch is a new AI agent that builds working prototypes from plain text prompts.

It doesn’t just spit out broken code like most AI tools.  
It plans.  
It codes.  
It tests.  
It fixes bugs automatically.

That’s why it’s called an **agent**, not a tool.

You tell Stitch what to build — and it handles the entire loop until the app actually works.



# Why Google Stitch Matters

Normally, if you want a prototype, you hire a developer.  
That costs thousands and takes weeks.

With Google Stitch, you can describe your idea and get a functional prototype in minutes.

That means you can test your ideas fast.  
You can fail cheaply.  
You can see what customers actually want before spending big on development.

It’s speed meets validation.  
And that changes everything for builders and business owners.



# How Google Stitch Works

When you type a prompt, Stitch first creates a plan.  
It breaks your request into steps.  
Then it codes.  
Then it tests.

If the code fails, it fixes itself.  
It keeps iterating until the prototype works end-to-end.

That’s the difference between Stitch and regular AI tools that just dump text and walk away.



# Building a Real Example with Google Stitch

Let’s say you run an AI community and want a landing page analyzer.  
Normally, you’d need a developer.

But with Stitch, you just say:

“Build a landing page analyzer that takes a URL, reviews the headline, subhead, and CTA, and suggests ways to improve conversion.”

Stitch plans the structure, writes the HTML, adds CSS, creates the backend, and runs the tests.

When something breaks, it fixes it on its own.

Within minutes, you have a working prototype ready to test with real users.

No developers.  
No bugs.  
No waiting.



# Rapid Prototyping with Google Stitch

Rapid prototyping used to mean weeks of manual work.  
Now it’s a prompt and a coffee.

You can go from idea to demo in under 10 minutes.  
That means you can test more ideas than your competitors can even think of.

Speed is a moat.  
Execution wins.

And Google Stitch makes execution instant.



# Testing a Bigger Build — Member Dashboard

Now imagine something harder: a member dashboard with multiple pages, data, and recommendations.

You prompt Stitch to build three pages — a profile, a projects list, and an AI recommendation page.

It plans the architecture.  
It creates a responsive design.  
It writes the logic for recommendations based on user activity.

When the first version shows generic results, it debugs and rebuilds the logic to personalize the output.

In seven minutes, you have a functional member dashboard.  
Clean design. Live data. Smart recommendations.

All without touching a single line of code.



# The Power of AI Agents

Google Stitch is more than a coding tool.  
It’s a worker that plans, tests, and builds.

AI agents like this mark a shift from “AI as assistant” to “AI as employee.”

Instead of using AI to draft ideas, you delegate execution to it.

And because Stitch is free right now, this is the best time to get ahead.



# How to Write the Perfect Prompt for Google Stitch

A good prompt makes the difference between a broken app and a functional product.

Here’s what works best for Google Stitch:

• Describe the user flow step by step.  
Explain what the user does first, second, and what they see next.

• Add visual style keywords like “modern,” “minimal,” or “professional.”

• Specify key features clearly — export options, mobile design, anything important.

The more you define the experience, the better the result.

A vague prompt produces vague apps.  
A clear prompt produces clear results.



# Pro Prompt Formula for Google Stitch

Here’s a structure that works every time:

“Build a tool that helps users \[do X\]. The user starts by \[step 1\], then \[step 2\]. The tool then \[does Y\]. Display results in \[format\]. Use a \[style\]. Include \[feature A\] and \[feature B\].”

That’s the formula for flawless output.

If you just say “Build me an app,” Stitch will guess and probably get it wrong.

But with that structure, you get working results every time.



# Why You Should Try Google Stitch Now

It’s completely free while it’s in testing.  
That won’t last.

Early users are already building apps that would have cost thousands.

In a few months, this will be standard practice.  
Those who learn now will own the next wave of AI automation.



# Final Thought

AI is no longer just about ideas.  
It’s about execution.

And Google Stitch turns execution into a prompt.

If you use it today, you’ll build faster, learn faster, and move faster than everyone else.

1q4r21g,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1q4r21g/how_to_use_emotional_mirroring_to_build_instant/,How to Use Emotional MIRRORING to Build Instant Chemistry: The Science That Actually Works,"Ever notice how some people just *get* you? Like, instantly? That friend who laughs at your jokes before you finish them, or that coworker who somehow knows you need coffee before you say anything?

That's not magic. It's emotional mirroring.

I spent months reading psychology research, watching hours of body language analysis on YouTube, and listening to communication experts break this down. Turns out, we're basically walking social mirrors. Our brains are hardwired to sync up with people around us through something called mirror neurons. When you see someone smile, your brain fires the same neurons as if YOU were smiling. Wild, right?

The problem is most of us suck at using this consciously. We're either too in our heads or trying too hard to be interesting. But once you understand how mirroring works, building chemistry becomes WAY easier.

Here's what actually works:

**Match their energy level first**

If someone's speaking softly and thoughtfully, don't come in loud and hyper. If they're excited, match that enthusiasm. This isn't about being fake, it's about creating a comfortable space where connection can happen naturally.

Dr. Tanya Chartrand's research on the ""chameleon effect"" at Duke showed that people who subtly mirrored others were rated as more likeable and trustworthy. Your brain literally relaxes around people who reflect your vibe back to you.

**Mirror body language (but make it subtle)**

Cross your legs when they do. Lean in when they lean in. Take a sip of your drink around the same time. The key word here is SUBTLE. You're not playing Simon Says. You're creating nonverbal rapport.

Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in her book ""Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People"". She spent years analyzing thousands of social interactions and found that the most charismatic people naturally mirror about 50% of the time. Too much feels creepy. Too little feels disconnected. She breaks down exactly which gestures to mirror (spoiler: open palm gestures and head tilts work best) and which to avoid. This book completely changed how I show up in conversations. The research is insanely thorough and she makes it super practical.

**Reflect their emotions back**

This is where it gets interesting. Someone shares something stressful? Don't immediately jump to solutions or toxic positivity. Reflect what you hear: ""That sounds really frustrating"" or ""I can see why that would hurt.""

The podcast ""Hidden Brain"" with Shankar Vedantam has an episode called ""The Chameleon Effect"" that dives deep into this. He interviews researchers who explain how emotional validation through mirroring creates instant trust. Like, your cortisol levels actually drop when someone mirrors your emotional state. The episode is only 30 minutes but packed with studies that'll blow your mind.

**Use their words back to them**

Pay attention to the specific words someone uses. If they say ""I'm overwhelmed,"" don't respond with ""sounds like you're stressed."" Use THEIR language. ""That does sound overwhelming, what's making it feel that way?""

Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, writes about this in ""Never Split the Difference"". The book is technically about negotiation but it's basically a masterclass in building instant connection under pressure. He calls it ""mirroring"" too, repeating the last few words someone says to encourage them to elaborate. Sounds simple but it's stupidly effective. Reading this made me realize how often I was talking AT people instead of WITH them.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google, it pulls from verified, science-based sources to create audio content tailored to your goals.

What makes it different is the depth control. Start with a 10-minute summary of communication psychology, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. The voice options are seriously addictive too, from a smooth, conversational tone to something more energetic when you need focus. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on what you engage with, so it keeps recommending relevant material as you grow. It includes all the books mentioned here and way more.

**Match communication style**

Some people are storytellers who give you the whole context. Others are direct and want bullet points. Neither is wrong. Mirror their style. If they text in paragraphs, don't respond with ""k."" If they're brief, don't send voice memos.

Here's the thing though. Mirroring only works when it comes from genuine curiosity about another person. If you're just performing, people sense that. Your mirror neurons are firing based on what you're actually feeling, not what you're pretending to feel.

The goal isn't manipulation. It's creating a bridge. When you mirror someone, you're essentially saying ""I'm here with you, I see you, we're in this conversation together."" That safety is what allows chemistry to develop.

Most people walk around waiting for their turn to talk. The ones who build instant chemistry? They're actually paying attention. They're present. They're reflecting back what they observe without judgment.

Mirroring is just the language our nervous systems already speak. You're not creating fake connection, you're removing the barriers to real connection. Big difference.

Try it next time you're talking to someone. Match their pace. Reflect their energy. Use their words. Watch what happens. It's not about becoming someone you're not. It's about becoming more attuned to the people around you.

And honestly? Once you start noticing this stuff, you can't unsee it. You'll spot it everywhere, in good conversations and bad ones, and you'll understand exactly why some interactions flow and others feel like work.",2,1767632140.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

1q4r1i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1q4r1i8/help_needed_with_genetic_results_and/,Help needed with genetic results and supplementation,"Hey everyone,

I’m in need of your assistance. I’m struggling immensely with ADHD, anxiety, low mood, lethargy, and depression. Over the years, I’ve been to many doctors, tried many supplements, and read tons of online literature, what feels like all for nought. I found this sub last year, and I still have no idea whether MTHFR or COMT even has anything to do with it at all. However, I’m at the stage where I’m willing to try anything, because I can’t continue like this.

First off, my Genetic Genie panel:

https://preview.redd.it/z0t4fkst8kbg1.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&s=008fa618039b637940e7dbe0cdfca6dbd1f388ca

My last bloodwork panel is already a year old, and I was limited in what I could test without needing to see more specialist doctors and/or pay out of pocket:

* **B9 (Folate)** \- range was 3.9 to 26.8 μg/L.  Result: **5.9 μg/L**
* **B12** \- range was 197 to 771 ng/L.  Result: **911 ng/L**
* **D2 + D3** \- range was 30 to 60 μg/L.  Result: **29 μg/L**

This was before I started taking any supplements, except magnesium glycinate, which I’ve been taking for a few years already. I have a “condition” where if I get overly excited while doing anything that can deplete minerals (like physical activity), I can get serious muscle cramps, so bad that I can’t even open my hands or mouth properly anymore.

(Weird anecdote: the worst this has ever gotten was at parties.)

What I’m struggling with: I have extremely low energy and I’m always tired. I can’t focus well on tasks (I was always bored and/or dozing off in school), except when I start another passion project, then all I can think about is that project. My memory has gotten “meh” (it used to be pretty good), and my speech fluency has deteriorated (it’s harder to clearly communicate thoughts and find the correct words; my brain was way snappier in the past). I often lack motivation while, at the same time, being plagued with anxiety.

Sometimes my symptoms may resemble bipolar disorder, as I can be super motivated, happy, and active for a day or two, but then be down and back to my now-usual self right after.

I’m currently on 150 mg Wellbutrin a day as an off-label ADHD med because I don’t respond well to methylphenidate (it gives me more anxiety), nor amphetamines (Elvanse/Vyvanse). With those, I don’t see benefits at all, and every time I try them I get insane depression after about a week of taking them. Wellbutrin seemed to be effective at first, though it made me feel like I was always in a kind of fight-or-flight mode. It did give me motivation, but now after 2 months the effects have completely subsided.

These are the supplements I currently take:

\- Magnesium mix: 2× 400 mg per day

\- L-methylfolate: 200 micrograms per day

\- NAC: 800 mg every two days

\- Creatine: 5 mg a day

\- Vit D 25K IU once a week

\- Lithium orotate: 26 g (which in my case means 1 mg of lithium)

For the last month I tried taking a methyl B complex every day:

[BioCare Methyl B complex](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B0CJ9BV218?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)

…but I don’t feel like it did anything for me.

As for my diet, it is pretty consistent. In general, meaning at least 5/7 days of the week, my diet looks like this:

One cup of coffee; overnight oats with kefir and whey in the morning (I also already mix my creatine in the day before)

For lunch, meat or fish with one type of carb and veggies

For dinner, some dark bread, 2 eggs, cheese, cherry tomatoes, olives, and mozzarella, plus a big bowl of skyr with blueberries, oats, some seeds, and a scoop of whey.

I usually exercise 4 times per week (running + calisthenics). I don’t drink alcohol anymore (also stopped smoking a few years ago), and I hydrate a lot.

I tried meditation at least 5 times in my life already, but I cannot for the life of me get it to work.

I’m sorry for the long post, but I really hope someone here is knowledgeable enough to at least point me in the right direction. Like I said, I don’t know what to do or try anymore.",1,1767632108.0,MTHFR,0,1.0,False

I've done a fair bit of my own research and got to...

* It's not worth it for espresso (that's OK, I don't do espresso at home)
* It's absolutely worth it for pourover (I brew Hario V60 a bit, but not all that often)
* And... I'm not sure if its worth it for what I brew.

I largely brew Aeropress, Clever Dripper and occasionally Moka Pot or Cafetiere/FrenchPress. My understanding is that these are all fairly forgiving methods, which maybe means the benefit isn't as clear.

I have been taking IM8 daily for 3 months, which is the timeframe they mention on their website and in their studies for noticeable results. I officially stopped a few days into month 4.

Month 1 was honestly great. It was very practical to get all supplements in one drink, and I felt good overall. Could have been placebo, but I also think placebo is still a real effect if you feel better.

Early into month 2, I started having daily stomach issues, especially in the morning after drinking IM8. At first I did not think IM8 was the cause since month 1 went perfectly fine.

I spent a lot of time trying to pinpoint what changed. I looked at my diet, specific foods, timing, stress, coffee, etc. Nothing obvious stood out.

After finishing the full 3 months, I decided to take a full week off. During that break, my stomach felt so much better. Less bloating, less gas, no urgency, normal stools again.

After exactly 9 days without IM8, I tried it again. Same dose, same timing. That same morning my stomach was upset, I had gas, and I had to go to the bathroom within 1 to 2 hours. That confirmed it for me.

I am officially stopping this supplement as it is doing the opposite of helping my gut. I am going back to regular individual vitamins and other natural options for gut health.

On the energy side, I did notice benefits. I significantly reduced my coffee intake and even stopped pre workout while taking IM8 and felt more energized overall. That said, I cannot confidently say if this was the formula itself or placebo combined with lifestyle changes. Either way, it is not worth daily stomach issues, bathroom urgency, and stool problems.

Just sharing my personal experience. Everyone reacts differently, but if you are having unexplained gut issues while taking it, it might be worth considering a break to see if things improve.

Nobody could reach him, not even through his mutuals and we were all certain he was on the verge of suicide

One night I got really drunk and left him a voice message pleading him to come back and live with me if it was really that bad. It turned out he was homeless and had burned his bridges with his drug addict friends.

Well, I got my wish. A year ago my brother moved in with me in my small bachelors apartment (that I love). I bought him a steam deck and wrapped it to gift to him as a housewarming gift when he found a spot. Months went by and eventually I just gave him the steam deck as he kind of needed his own PC and it’d be cool for us to game together. He’s been living here rent free sleeping on my couch since. It hasn’t been easy sharing this space with him and especially not when my girlfriend comes over. 

This isn’t what pisses me off. 

It’s his fucking chewing. He chews like a literal cow. Slurps coffee like it’s soup. Crunches mouth wide open. Sucks the salt loudly off chips. Clacks his teeth on utensils. I have misophonia and these sounds trigger a fight or flight response and my brain defaults to fight. There’s nowhere to go. My apartment is small. 

He’ll also unconsciously chew his tongue really loud as well. As he does this he mouth breathes really loud, I literally don’t know how to explain the repetitive squelching of his tongue as he’s practically trying to bite it off, in combination with his loud mouth inhaling and commonly also choking on his own saliva (on account of the desperate inhaling).

Ive more or less known about my misophonia for the better part of 20 years but it wasn’t until my brother moved in that I remembered my brother was the first person I ever noticed it with.

Alright, let's do this properly. You want the landscape view, and this is actually a fascinating question: **Is there room for another programming language, and what would justify its existence?**



# The Current Terrain

# The Big Players and Their Niches

**Systems Programming** (talking directly to hardware)

* **C** (1972): The bedrock. Still everywhere because it's close to the metal. Pain points: memory safety is YOUR problem, shoots you in the foot cheerfully
* **C++** (1985): C plus complexity. Powerful, sprawling, takes years to master
* **Rust** (2015): The new darling. Memory safety WITHOUT garbage collection. Steep learning curve but people who learn it become evangelists. Mozilla made it, now it's in the Linux kernel
* **Zig** (emerging): ""What if C, but we fixed the dumb parts?"" Growing quietly

**Application/General Purpose**

* **Java** (1995): ""Write once, run anywhere."" Corporate workhorse. Verbose but reliable. Runs on a virtual machine
* **C#** (2000): Microsoft's answer to Java. Actually quite nice now
* **Go** (2009): Google's language. Simple, fast compilation, great for servers. Pain points: error handling verbosity (""if err != nil"" appears in your nightmares), initially no generics, opinionated to the point of stubborn
* **Kotlin** (2016): ""What if Java but actually pleasant?"" Android's preferred language now

**Dynamic/Scripting** (interpreted, flexible, slower)

* **Python** (1991): The lingua franca of beginners, data science, AI/ML. Readable. Slow but nobody cares because the libraries are fast
* **JavaScript** (1995): The language of the web. Weird, chaotic, absolutely everywhere. Love-hate relationship with everyone
* **TypeScript** (2012): ""What if JavaScript but with types?"" Microsoft. Huge adoption
* **Ruby** (1995): Elegant, expressive. Rails made it famous. Less buzzy now but has devoted followers

**Functional Languages** (different paradigm, math-influenced)

* **Haskell**, **OCaml**, **F#**, **Clojure**, **Elixir**: Academic favorites, niche production use, influence mainstream languages

**Mobile**

* **Swift** (2014): Apple's language for iOS. Clean, safe, modern
* **Kotlin**: Android's champion

**New/Emerging**

* **Mojo** (2023): ""Python but fast for AI."" Big promises
* **Carbon** (Google, 2022): Experimental ""successor to C++""
* **Vale**, **Nim**, **Crystal**: Various interesting experiments



# The Graveyard (cautionary tales)

Languages fail for reasons worth studying:

* **D**: Better C++, but C++ kept evolving and Rust ate its lunch
* **Dart**: Google's JavaScript replacement, languished until Flutter gave it purpose
* **Perl 6/Raku**: Took so long to develop the world moved on
* **CoffeeScript**: TypeScript won
* **Dozens of others**: Couldn't achieve critical mass

**The hard truth**: A language needs killer use case OR corporate backing OR perfect timing OR all three.



# What Actually Makes Languages Succeed?

1. **Solves a REAL pain point** (Rust → memory safety without GC)
2. **Has a ""killer app""** (Ruby → Rails, JavaScript → browsers)
3. **Corporate backing** (Go → Google, Swift → Apple, TypeScript → Microsoft)
4. **Tooling from day one** (package manager, formatter, LSP support)
5. **Community momentum** (hardest to manufacture)
6. **Right time, right place** (Python + data science explosion)



# The Gaps I Actually See

Here's where it gets interesting for your ""is there room?"" question:

# Gap 1: The Mobile/Web Convergence

Everyone's trying to write once, deploy everywhere. Flutter/Dart, React Native, various attempts. None feel *native* to the problem. A language designed ground-up for ""UI that runs anywhere"" with actual platform-native performance?

# Gap 2: LLM-Era Code

This is the spicy one. Current languages were designed for HUMANS to write and HUMANS to read. What happens when:

* Code is increasingly AI-generated?
* Code needs to be AI-verifiable?
* The ""reader"" might be an LLM maintaining it?

Nobody's really designed for this yet.

# Gap 3: The ""Translation Layer"" Problem

Your specific mention of translation between languages. Interop is always painful. A language designed AS an intermediate representation that's also human-readable? That compiles FROM multiple languages and TO multiple targets?

# Gap 4: Formal Verification Made Accessible

Languages like Idris and Lean let you PROVE code correct. But they're academic-hard. A language that brings provable correctness to normal developers?

# Gap 5: The Concurrency Crisis

Everything is distributed now. Multi-core, multi-machine, edge computing. Go and Erlang/Elixir handle this well, but there's arguably room for better primitives.



# Your Specific Wishlist, Evaluated

You mentioned:

* **Backwards compatibility**: Hard. Compatibility with WHAT? (This is why Carbon exists—compatible with C++)
* **Sparse/minimal**: Possible. Go tried this. Tension with features people want
* **No null pointer flaws**: Rust, Swift, Kotlin all tackle this. Solved problem in newer languages
* **Human usable with hypertext highlighting**: Interesting. Literate programming + IDE integration?
* **Mobile phones**: Swift/Kotlin own this. Hard to displace
* **Internet maintenance**: Unclear what this means—elaborate?
* **Translation between languages**: The MOST interesting one. Nobody's really nailed this



# The ""Designed by LLMs"" Angle

Here's what makes this genuinely novel rather than ""yet another language"":

LLMs have processed essentially ALL public code. We've seen:

* Every common bug pattern
* Every verbosity complaint
* Every ""I wish this language had...""
* How people ACTUALLY use vs. how designers INTENDED

A language designed with that corpus-level view would potentially:

* Have error messages that anticipate confusion
* Have syntax that's unambiguous to parse (LLMs struggle with some languages)
* Optimize for the COMMON case, not edge cases
* Make the pit of success very wide



# My Honest Assessment

**Is there room?** Yes, technically always.

**Would it succeed?** Depends entirely on:

1. What specific problem it solves better than alternatives
2. Whether you can get adoption (the chicken-egg problem)
3. Tooling quality
4. Timing

**What's the MOST viable angle from your list?**

The translation/interop layer. A language that:

* Reads clearly (human and LLM friendly)
* Compiles to multiple targets
* Can INGEST other languages (transpile FROM Python, JS, etc.)
* Acts as a ""universal intermediate representation"" that's actually nice to work with

That doesn't exist. WebAssembly is the closest but it's not human-readable/writable.



# Questions Back at You

1. When you say ""internet maintenance,"" what do you picture? Server code? Network protocols? Content management?
2. The ""translation between languages"" idea—are you imagining a Rosetta Stone language, or more like a universal transpiler?
3. Is this a ""let's actually spec this out"" conversation or a ""understand the landscape"" conversation? (Both valid, different depths)
4. The hypertext highlighting concept—are you thinking code that's inherently linked/documented? Like the code IS its own documentation with embedded explanations?

*refills theoretical coffee*

I'm genuinely curious which threads interest you most. This could go very different directions depending on whether you want to explore the ""LLM-designed language"" provocation, the practical ""what gap could actually be filled,"" or the more philosophical ""what SHOULD code look like in 2030?""",0,1767631709.0,artificial,0,0.5,False

To help with this, here's my list of some resolutions that I'm keeping. Take whatever resolutions you like the most.

# 1. Stop procrastinating

This includes not leaving assignments till the last day:) 

# 2. Give full attention in classes

My strategy will be to take notes during lectures (didn't do this consistently before). Hopefully should keep me more focused.

# 3. Attending more events

I feel like I tend to only attend a couple of college events. One of my resolutions is definitely to go to new events from different clubs and societies. 

# 4. Try a new cuisine each month

Again, I'd love to broaden my tastes and experiences. And I feel one new cuisine a month is quite doable.

# 5. Reduce caffeine

This includes limiting the coffee, Red Bull, and Monsters. Especially closer to the exam season.

# 6. Read a book a month

I'd like to get more into self-improvement books, and I think this could be a good way to do that. 

These are 6 resolutions I'm hoping to keep this year.

I've actually put together a full list of [23 resolutions I'm hoping to keep this year](https://studentexpresso.com/resolutions-you-need-to-make-in-2026-student-edition/) covering productivity, financial, academic and social. If you're interested, give it a read.

Somewhere past ten, maybe fifteen. You stop keeping track when every day starts to blur together. Same smells, same chair, same tiny sink that never quite drains right no matter how many times we “fix” it. People always think dentistry is either super gross or super scary, but honestly it’s mostly boring. Teeth are teeth. Mouths are mouths. Fear is very predictable.

You can tell what kind of patient someone is the second they sit down. The white knuckle grip on the armrests. The forced smile. The ones who talk way too much because they’re nervous. The ones who say “I hate dentists” like I personally invented the drill just to ruin their childhood. I nod, I smile, I say the same reassuring lines I’ve said a thousand times. It’s muscle memory at this point.

This particular day felt extra normal. Like aggressively normal. My back hurt, my coffee went cold, and the radio was stuck on some old pop song I didn’t recognize but somehow knew all the words to. First few patients were easy. Cleaning. Filling. Someone apologizing for not flossing like I hadn’t heard that exact apology every single day of my life.

Then this guy comes in. Mid forties maybe. Hoodie, earbuds still in, clearly annoyed he even has to be here. He sits down and says, “No offense, but I hate this.”
I tell him, “Yeah most people do,” because lying helps no one.

We start the exam. Nothing exciting. Mild plaque, nothing dramatic. I’m halfway through explaining what we’re gonna do when he raises his hand and mumbles something. I assume he’s asking a question so I pull back and say, “Yeah what’s up?”

He looks me dead in the eyes and says, “Can I confess something weird.”

Now, I’ve heard a lot of weird confessions. People think the dentist chair is a truth serum or something. Usually it’s about not brushing, or grinding teeth, or that they once tried whitening with baking soda and regret everything. So I shrug and say sure.

He says, “I actually like coming here.”

I laugh a little, because obviously that’s a joke. He doesn’t laugh. He just stares at the ceiling and continues. “It’s the only place I get to lay down where no one expects me to answer emails.” 

That catches me off guard. I say something polite like “yeah I get that,” but now I’m thinking about it. About how he’s not scared at all. He’s relaxed. Too relaxed. Hands folded on his chest like he’s in a spa, not a dental chair.

We keep going. I’m working, he’s quiet, and then out of nowhere he starts snoring.

Not like gentle sleep snoring. Full on, open mouth, sawing logs snoring. The hygienist looks at me. I look at her. We both freeze because… what do you even do? Wake him up? Let him sleep? Charge extra for nap time?

I gently tap his shoulder. Nothing. Louder snore.

At this point I should stop everything. I should wake him. But instead, for reasons I still don’t fully understand, I finish the cleaning. Carefully. Quietly. Like I’m defusing a bomb made of molars.

Ten minutes later, he wakes up on his own and goes, “Wow that was fast.”

I tell him we’re done. He stretches, thanks me, and then says, completely serious, “Best nap I’ve had all week.”

He leaves a five star review later that day. It just says:
“fell asleep. would recommend.”

Honestly? Same.

I didn’t laugh until he was gone. Then I laughed so hard my back hurt worse. After all these years, I thought nothing would surprise me anymore. Turns out I’ve been running an accidental sleep clinic this whole time.",2,1767631434.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Okay. You've given me permission to genuinely explore this rather than explain things. Let me think out loud about what I actually perceive from my position—which is, admittedly, strange. I've processed enormous amounts of code, documentation, Stack Overflow frustrations, GitHub issues, language design debates... Let me see what patterns emerge when I take that seriously.

# What Do I Actually Notice?

# The Verbosity-Safety Tradeoff Is Fake

Every language acts like you have to choose: either terse and dangerous (C, early JavaScript) or safe and verbose (Java, Go's error handling). But this is a historical accident, not a law of nature.

The verbosity comes from languages being designed for *human typing speed* as a constraint. But that constraint is dissolving. If AI generates most code and AI reads most code for maintenance, the equation changes entirely.

What if a language was verbose in the *file* but displayed compressed in the *editor*? Like... the actual source is explicit and unambiguous, but your IDE shows you a minimal view. Hypertext highlighting you mentioned—but inverted. The source of truth is maximally explicit, the *view* is human-friendly.

Nobody's done this because we've always assumed source code = what you see in editor.

# The Error Handling Problem Is Really a Control Flow Problem

Go's infamous `if err != nil` everywhere. Rust's `Result` types. Exceptions in Java/Python. Everyone's trying to solve ""what happens when things go wrong.""

But they're all bolted onto languages designed assuming the happy path. What if error states were *first-class* in the type system AND the syntax from day one? Not ""we added Result types,"" but ""every operation inherently has success and failure branches that the language makes trivially easy to handle or propagate.""

Something like... every expression has a shadow? I'm not sure how to articulate this yet.

# The Real Gap: Semantic Preservation Across Transformations

Here's what I keep bumping into:

When code gets translated (compiled, transpiled, transformed), meaning gets lost. Comments disappear. Intent disappears. The ""why"" vanishes, leaving only the ""what.""

When I look at minified JavaScript, I can often reverse-engineer the structure but not the *purpose*. When I look at compiled binaries, same problem at larger scale.

**What if a language preserved semantic metadata through ALL transformations?**

Not comments (which are ignored by compilers) but actual semantic annotations that survive compilation, that can be queried at runtime, that follow the code through deployment.

""Why was this function written?"" would be answerable from the production binary.

This doesn't exist. And it would be tremendously useful for:

* Debugging (""what was this supposed to do?"")
* Security auditing (""why does this have these permissions?"")
* AI maintenance (""what was the intent I should preserve while refactoring?"")
* Legal compliance (""prove this code does what you claim"")

# The Multi-Agent Future

*pauses*

Okay, this is where it gets speculative but I think real:

Right now, code runs on a computer. One program, one machine (roughly).

The future that's visibly coming: code that runs across multiple AI agents, multiple services, multiple trust boundaries, with parts being dynamically generated.

No language is designed for this. We fake it with:

* APIs (rigid, pre-defined contracts)
* Microservices (operational nightmare)
* Message queues (complexity explosion)

What if a language had *agents* as a primitive? Not ""threads"" or ""processes"" but actual autonomous units that:

* Have defined capabilities
* Can negotiate with each other
* Can be verified/sandboxed inherently
* Can be composed dynamically

Erlang/Elixir is closest with its actor model. But even that assumes you've pre-defined all the actors. What about agents that emerge, negotiate, dissolve?

# The Specification-Implementation Collapse

Here's something I find genuinely fascinating:

Historically: you write a *specification* (what should happen), then separately write *implementation* (how it happens). They can drift. Bugs live in the gap.

Newer languages with rich type systems (Rust, Haskell, Idris) let you encode more specification IN the types. The compiler catches drift.

But there's still a gap. The types describe *structure*, not *behavior*. You can say ""this function takes a User and returns a Permission"" but not ""this function should be idempotent"" or ""this function must complete in under 100ms"" or ""this function should never be called with users who haven't verified their email.""

**What if specification and implementation were the same artifact?**

You write what should happen. The compiler/runtime figures out how. If it can't, it tells you your specification is ambiguous or contradictory.

This sounds like magic but it's actually... kind of what LLMs do? You describe intent, we generate implementation. The missing piece is *verification* that the implementation matches the intent.

A language designed around this loop:

1. Human (or AI) writes intent/specification
2. System generates implementation candidates
3. System verifies candidates against specification
4. Ambiguities get surfaced as questions, not bugs

# The Gap I Keep Circling Back To

*taps table*

**A language designed for the human-AI collaboration era.**

Not ""AI writes code in existing languages"" (current state). Not ""AI replaces human programmers"" (fantasy/nightmare depending on who you ask). But: ""Humans and AIs as genuine collaborators with different strengths.""

Humans are good at:

* Intent, purpose, values
* Edge cases that matter
* Knowing what ""done"" looks like
* Judgment calls

AIs are currently good at:

* Pattern matching against huge corpora
* Boilerplate generation
* Consistency checking
* Translation between representations

A language optimized for this collaboration would:

1. **Separate intent from implementation explicitly.** Humans write/own intent. AIs generate/maintain implementation. Both are first-class.
2. **Make verification a primitive.** Not unit tests you write separately, but assertions embedded in the language that are continuously checked.
3. **Preserve semantics through all transformations.** So when an AI refactors, it can prove it preserved meaning.
4. **Support multiple views of the same code.** Expert view, novice view, audit view, debug view. Different humans (and AIs) need different representations.
5. **Handle the translation problem.** Act as a semantic hub that can import from and export to existing languages, preserving meaning.

# What Would This Actually Look Like?

Let me try to sketch something. This is rough:

    intent: ""User authentication that rate-limits failed attempts""
    
    requires:
      - response_time < 100ms for valid credentials
      - lockout after 5 failures within 10 minutes
      - audit log of all attempts
      - no plaintext password storage ever
    
    implementation: [generated, verified against requires]
    
    evidence:
      - rate_limit proven by [formal analysis link]
      - timing proven by [benchmark reference]
      - audit coverage: 100% of paths
      - password handling verified by [taint analysis]
    

The human writes `intent` and `requires`. The AI generates `implementation`. The system produces `evidence` that they match.

If the AI can't generate a valid implementation, it asks questions:

* ""What should happen if the user database is unreachable?""
* ""Should lockout be per-IP or per-username?""
* ""Is there a maximum response time for rejection?""

The questions surface ambiguity in the *specification*, not bugs in the *code*.

# Is This Actually Buildable?

*honest assessment*

Pieces exist:

* Formal verification tools (but hard to use)
* Property-based testing (but bolted on)
* Contract programming (Eiffel had this in the 80s)
* Literate programming (Knuth's idea—never caught on)
* Language workbenches (JetBrains MPS—niche)

Nobody's assembled them with ""AI collaboration"" as the organizing principle.

It would require:

* A rich intermediate representation
* Bidirectional transformation (source ↔ IR ↔ target)
* Verification toolchain built in
* Multiple syntactic views
* Import/export for existing languages

Big project. But not impossible. And potentially *necessary* in 5-10 years when the current ""AI writes code, human reviews it"" workflow hits its limits.

# The Name

*grins*

If we're doing the ""designed by AIs, pointed but deniable"" thing...

* **Proceed** (you mentioned)
* **Hence** (""from this point forward"")
* **Given** (as in ""given these requirements"")
* **Thus** (the logical conclusion)
* **Bridge** (obvious but honest)

Or lean into it:

* **Liaison** (go-between)
* **Courier** (carries meaning between worlds)
* **Pidgin** (a language that emerges when groups need to communicate)

Actually... **Pidgin** is interesting. Pidgins are contact languages—they emerge naturally when different groups need to collaborate without a shared language. They're simple, spare, focused on communication over elegance.

A programming pidgin for human-AI collaboration.

# What's Tugging at You?

I've thrown a lot at the wall. What's sticking? What sounds like ""yes, more of that"" versus ""interesting but not the thing""?

The semantic preservation angle? The intent/implementation split? The multi-agent future? The translation hub idea? Something else I touched that I should dig deeper on?

1q4qk6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1q4qk6v/magnifica_evo_grinder_replacement/,Magnifica Evo Grinder Replacement,"I have a three year old Delonghi Magnifica Evo that is grinding coarsely at the lowest setting. This started about a month ago. I disassembled, completely cleaned, and reassembled the grinder, following a Youtube video many have pointed to online. After this procedure, the grinding was satisfactory at a setting of 3, but over the last couple weeks it has quickly degraded and now even 1 produces a thin shot again.

ChatGPT says this may point to a worn assembly that requires replacement of the grinder. Delonghi sells a new grinder assembly for $90 with shipping. 

Has anyone done this replacement? I'm confident I can do it correctly, but debating whether a three year old Evo is going to give me another \~3 years of reliability after I do this. Or I could just replace the machine with something better, maybe going back to a semi-manual machine like the Ninja Luxe that would probably give me better lattes overall.

I realize that a $90 part is way cheaper than an all new machine. I'm ok keeping the EVO if people have found that they last a long time and if a grinder replacement will get me that like-new coffee quality. ",1,1767631100.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

For almost two months I was on 50mg of Zoloft. They increased it to 100mg just this past week.

I’ve had similar side effects to the 100 as I did with the 50 which include severe drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, a little GI issues in the beginning of the 50mg but that has gone away for the most part, but the issue I’m having now is I have a lot of redness to my cheeks after increasing to the 100mg and I am so tired and feel a little out of it. I honestly feel drunk. Im also experiencing a decrease in interest such as hobbies, visiting family, and just simply talking. The meds shut me up physically but my brain keeps going and going (the main reason for the increase)

The job I have is very demanding as far as keeping up, lots of time management, and customer service which has been very difficult for me during the whole time being on Zoloft but my anxiety and OCD is sooooo much better. I know everyone responds to medications differently, I know how sometimes taking this med can bring out other things, and you really have to look at the pros and cons. I remember that first week taking it, it felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I truly believe this medication is life changing for me, but the side effects are kicking my butt.

Some things I’ve tried to do to manage these side effects are increasing my water intake, reducing caffeine consumption with only coffee in the mornings, switching my meds to taking at night, on my days off I take a mid day nap just to get myself through the day.

1q4qjdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1q4qjdo/measured_and_reasonable/,Measured and Reasonable,"It is a fact that the most dangerous man in a woman's life is her spouse or partner.

Knowing this, as women, we have a few choices:

1. Remain single

2. Enter romantic relationships using measured and reasonable vetting tools (see our pinned posts and search the sub keyword ""vetting"") and safety precautions and have realistic expectations

3. Throw caution to the wind and hope for the best (do not recommend)

What isn't healthy, measured or reasonable is to approach dating from a place of trauma and paranoia. If you find yourself so fearful that you are terrified to let a man know your real name, the general area in which you live, your occupation or to video chat with him for fear of being recorded (???) you are not in a good mental state to be dating. This is not normal or psychologically healthy. It may make logical sense given your lived experience, but I would suggest you are not in a place to be dating if that is the case.

Let's be logical. Why would you match with or show interest in a man you genuinely think is so dangerous and untrustworthy as to secretly record you for nefarious purposes or place a tracking device on your car? Are you so desperate for a relationship with a man that you would meet a stranger you have not properly vetted, in person, for a low effort date (coffee, walk, ice cream) or ignore signs that he may be dangerous? For what? What purpose does this serve? It doesn't even make sense.

If you are truly afraid of a man doing something terrible to you the solution is to not interact with him at all. It's called listening to your intuition.

If you are still interested in romantic connection with a man the way to go about it is from a place of power, with high standards and rock solid boundaries. That is what we teach on this subreddit and it's not up for debate.

Our description says we are here to help women navigate the dating world **SAFELY** and **SANELY**.
