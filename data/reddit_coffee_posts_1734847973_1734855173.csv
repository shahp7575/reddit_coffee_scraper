1hju5ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hju5ty/about_to_go_for_rancilio_spx_unless_someone_wants/,"About to go for Rancilio SPX, unless someone wants to talk me out (to CAD 4k)","My original and beloved Silvia is again showing its age (20+ yrs), and I’m pretty sure this time the repair is more than the machine is worth: no matter what I do I can’t seem to get performance on steam up to anything like acceptable levels, so I’m sure I have enough scale build-up to need a boiler replacement and the parts cost alone is too great to justify it.  And anyway, dual boilers are so much better to work with.

Naturally, when I heard about the Silvia Pro X I pretty much decided that was the machine for me.  And some guy on YouTube going on about how it made the best coffee but how some other machine was better because it was more “prosumer”, whatever the heck that meant, sealed the deal for me. But then someone told me about the Lelit Bianca v3, and I became confused and flustered.  

I’m in Toronto, and I managed to talk myself out of the Bianca using the $1000 price difference between it and the SPX.  I have the money, but only just, and $1000 would buy a lot of coffee.  In truth, though, I’d cheerfully spend the extra thousand except for all the reports of service issues with Lelit machines.

So I thought that was it, until someone else suggested that I look at the Lelit Elizabeth v3, because it’ll do anything the Rancilio will do, it’s slightly smaller (the space isn’t that big a deal, but counter space is always a thing), and it’ll save me another $600. Again, though, the reliability reports are persuasive to me. 

A thing I love about my ancient Silvia is that it has never let me down.  It’s become a little wheezy from time to time, and I’ve had to do a couple overhauls and sometimes it leaked when I wasn’t paying enough attention to service. As near as I can tell, it’s built like a Soviet tank. I don’t seem to find the concerns about various failures and service issues with the SPX that I see (in part on this sub) about either of the Lelit machines.  Am I suffering from confirmation bias?  Is it that Rancilio buyers are more willing to compromise and so don’t complain about issues (it’s unquestionably true that the Bianca embodies way fewer compromises in terms of features).

Finally, of course, all of this is a little ridiculous, since I live alone and drink at most 7 shots/day, two of them milk drinks if I’m being especially profligate.     Still, I roast my own coffee.  I’m reasonably into it, and I don’t want to pass up a better machine on the basis of poor information.

Nonetheless I know I’m taking the “easy way out” but i just wanted to try it. I’ve been looking at semaglutide for a while and decided to try it from tryeden so I guess I’ll document my review about them and see if I’m actually losing weight. 
I’m currently 170 pounds and I have been taking it since Tuesday night weekly it’s injection. Tbh I haven’t really noticed a lot of changes, I will say I use the toilet more everyday but I don’t know if that’s just me drinking coffee lol. I am eating less but idk if it’s my mind tricking me or I’m actually not hungry anymore. I still do get hungry, I’m currently hungry but I am trying to lose weight so I think that’s pretty normal. Food noise is still there but it is a low dosage. I’m taking 0.25 ml weekly. And this is my first week so I wasn’t expecting something crazy. But I do still get hungry and im trying to eat less nonetheless because I’m paying money for this and I actually wanna lose weight and this is a reminder if this don’t work then I’m just wasting my money. 
For my experience with them well it was kinda weird. They were really helpful in like the beginning and a doctor gave me a whole essay basically talking about the process and stuff and they said if you need to reach out just text them. I wanted specific delivery instructions and so I texted them and they replied and said they’ll get back to me. I said ok and it’s been a day and they never reached out so I texted again, and then the day after that I texted again and no response. By this point I’m panicking lol and thought I got scammed. But I kinda told them I’ll talk to my bank if they don’t respond to cancel transaction. Think that worked really well cuz the next morning they sent me like 3 emails and responded and gave me back my answer and stuff and made sure that I get the service I deserve and they apologized. 
I’ll document how much weight I’ll lose I am trying to eat less though, but I really don’t normally eat much. I’m 5’5, 169-170lb and most of my weight is on my hips and thighs and arms. Anyways I felt like I should review this cuz I didn’t see a lot of reviews talking about how much weight they lose and they said a lot of tryedens reviews are from their employees and I’m not an employee I promise lol.

TW: SA, SH

Last year, I met up with a guy 8 years older than me. I know it’s my fault for meeting up with him when he was already pushing me to constantly send him nudes when I felt uncomfortable and told him I didn’t want to but he just kept saying it isn’t real life and to “relax we haven’t yet even touched each other”

I stupidly trusted him as I tend to believe the good in others. I assume no one lies. Over a period of 3 months he told me to trust him and that we need to be honest with each other. I had a bad gut feeling but I assumed it was anxiety. A few red flags appeared like him telling me loves me a few weeks in and messaging me 24/7 to the point where I always had to reply every 10 mins, as well as him telling me he loves being in control. As well as love bombing me (he will marry me, move in etc) and telling me he is a selfish person.

He wanted to meet up at a hotel and I said that we should have coffee first. He kept pushing and I just succumbed out of weakness, I guess.

I assumed he was not a bad person for other reasons too. Firstly, he has an impeccable reputation. He is known as the nice guy. He has also previously been in a decade long relationship so I assumed he was just an avoidant.

Anyway. Prior to deciding to meet up with him I told him I was on my period and didn’t want to do anything. He said of course, he just wanted to see me.

Then when I was there he kept pushing. I said can we just talk? Etc but he just said “I don’t want to talk”. You can guess what happened next. I was so mortified and scarred.

He continued to talk to me after convincing me he loves me and to be with him.

I asked him how could you not even ask me if I was okay? After it happened and I also asked why did you do it? But his reply was that “he wanted to”.

To me, nothing made sense. I felt confused for nearly up to a year. I spiralled so deeply.

Nothing made sense to me. The person I knew him before was nothing like who he really was.

Over time, I didn’t realise I was experiencing trauma and manipulation. He manipulated everything. It took me a VERY long time to figure it out but nothing he said matched with what he did. From the big things to little things. It was complete cognitive dissonance. For example, he would tell me he will always be there for me and always make time for me. When I expressed that it didn’t feel that way, he was adamant that I’m just overthinking it and he never once not replied to me. But whenever I did try to talk to him, he was always too busy.

Overtime, my parents realised something was wrong with me. I convinced myself I wanted what happened to me and I loved him because of the chemistry and talks between us. I ended up telling them what happened to me as well as confessing my self harming. It was here that I went to a therapist and she told me I was coerced, manipulated, SA'd and lied to.

I ended up looking at his ex’s profile on Instagram and saw she follows a bunch of cheating, narcissist and abuse pages. However she’s still on good terms with him so I don’t understand.

My question is - why do I feel like I made this all up still? Did I?

How do I stop blaming myself? Everyday is harder and harder. Everyday I tell myself it’s my fault. It must be - right? Technically, there was no violence involved. But I was too scared to say anything outwardly to push him away because he was demanding, persistent and the gut feeling I had with him was complete fear. My gut told me to run and that I wasn’t safe, yet I couldn’t seem to move.

For reference, I have experienced SA trauma before so my therapist says I have good hyper vigilance to the fact that I could see something wasn’t right. For example, his expressions didn’t match what he was saying.

He is also a police officer.

Apologies again for ranting.

To be honest, this story has way more context and layers to it but I have condensed it. Has anyone else been through something like this before? Any advice for stopping the rumination and wondering if you’re making it up? It’s especially hard when they are so loved in society. Sometimes it feels like the rumination and confusion never ends.",2,1734853861.0,Manipulation,0,1.0,False

1hjtznw,https://v.redd.it/ndqgameduc8e1,"During my wife’s pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly—now stuck with a 67” gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it’s the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‘sympathetic pregnancy,’ they’ve seen, hormones pushing my body into a hyper-sympathetic state.","I never thought I’d be writing this, but after what’s happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I’m living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children—twins!—and her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what’s called Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy,” where men mimic some of their partner’s pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny—me complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I’ve gained over 130 pounds, and it’s all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition—Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife’s pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here’s the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It’s perfectly round, heavy, and tight—so much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I’ve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public’s stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, “When are you due?” or “Are you having twins—or is it triplets?” Sometimes, people assume I’m joking when I say I’m not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling “Hey, heifer! How’d you get so huge, fatass!” and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, “When are the babies due?” and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, “Are you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you’re about to pop!” His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn’t pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like “Damn, bro, that’s the most impressive belly I’ve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That’s crazy.”

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called “the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.” The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife’s parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn’t believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it’s become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife’s.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife’s pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She’s been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I’m taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can’t help feeling guilty—this was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I’m the one everyone’s talking about.

Meanwhile, I’ve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don’t fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I’ve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don’t last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren’t any better—they’re so tight under the curve of my gut that I’ve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I’m required to wear a uniform—a button-up shirt, no less—and squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I’m sure they’ll pop, and they often do—sometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I’ve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I’m outgrowing something else, to the point where I’m running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it’s going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I’ve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal—it feels like I’m wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I’ve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They’ve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they’ve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it’s hard not to feel like a sideshow. I’ve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I’ve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there’s a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I’d wake up nauseous when she did, I’d have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I’d have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn’t just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body’s hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I’ve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn’t helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I’m not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it’s all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I’ve been experiencing—like elevated prolactin and cortisol levels—have completely derailed any sense of self-control. It’s as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I’ve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn’t anymore… Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of “hyper-storage mode,” where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it’s mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it’s created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It’s crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult—and frankly embarrassing—symptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it’s such a large part of the psychological side effects I’ve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be “confusing” my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I’m meant to desire or enjoy. It’s almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They’ve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop—my body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I’ve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices—like overeating or not avoiding tight clothes—that exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It’s created a cycle where I feel like I’m feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body’s way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don’t want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I’ve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It’s such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it’s my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it’s hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I’m doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I’m still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I’ve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth—or if this is something I’ll be living with for the rest of my life.

I trained her early on and I feel like I made it too obvious that I had a crush on her. I was complimenting her a lot and eventually commented on her crazy soft hands 🫣 After that I kinda backed off and just continued in a more friendly way because I wouldn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable at work. 

Then when I got back from vacation she was excited to see me and even asked me to go to a movie?? I was very excited but still not sure she felt anything romantic. Our conversations always bordered the line of flirting, sometimes it felt super obvious and other times I’m just not sure. 

The movies was awesome, we had great conversations and laughs. I told myself to just be friends for this hangout because I like being friends before dating. We have all this time working together to get to know each other so I don’t want to rush anything anyways. So it was great, but still just a friend hangout. We got coffee and pizza and hung out at her place afterwards and listened to music. It was hours of talking. 

Now the real question. I’m trying to quit smoking and she kept playfully saying I should quit ASAP. She literally stole my cigarettes at the movie hangout. And TODAY she basically (playfully) told me I reek of cigarettes after my break. She’s very blunt lol. Why does she care so much about me smoking? Does she want me to quit bc she doesn’t want to kiss a smoker? Or am I super delusional? I’m seriously getting that vibe though. 

She’s a Virgo and I’m a Pisces, so it kinda feels like she’s expressing how she cares about me in a way that just feels too harsh for me. I just don’t understand why she’d be so passionate about me quitting. 

This is my first real life adult queer romance so please be kind. Honestly if she’s not interested in me, it’s nbd, I’d still be happy being friends. Like I said, sometimes I feel like she’s really obviously flirting with me, but other times I think she’s just a friendly person who wants to be my friend. ",1,1734853134.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1hjtudm,https://i.redd.it/9pl1matlsc8e1.jpeg,Nurse from He(ll),"Let’s just start by saying I’m APPALLED by our nurse tonight. Let me preface this by saying our level 4 nicu transferred my son to another wing in the hospital for overflow. There is only 2 babies over here and we have one nurse.
First, my son is on NG tube feeds. 75ml over 45 minutes. She tried to put all of his milk in a bottle. I corrected her and said oh yeah he takes all his feeds from a syringe, told her the amount and length. She said oh yeah. I was just going to warm it up in this but I guess in the syringe would be easier? 
Then she goes to grab the only syringe from the feeder. Then sees me watching and says “oh I should probably use a new one”.  She then puts it in the warmer. 
Then she goes to change his diaper (I’m pumping right next to him) he was kidding about a little bit (nothing crazy) and she YANKED HIS LEG. So aggressively that it pulled him down a couple inches on the bed and he yelped out. Not to mention he just had surgery and has an incision right on his growing where his thigh creases on his hip. I was livid. But I literally bit my tongue and said nothing.
After this I pretty much took over the rest of his cares including weighing him bc I don’t want her picking up my son. 
She then proceeds to give him 60ml in the syringe for 45 minutes. Not a huge deal but whatever. Then she goes to give him his sodium phosphate. Can’t even pronounce it then genuinely asks me how she is supposed to administer it and says “do I just put it in the NG tube?” 🥴
I walked out for 2 minutes to get coffee down the hall because I decided there’s no way I’m sleeping tonight with her as his nurse. When I come back she’s rushing out of our room and about half an hour later I go in our bathroom (in the room) and there’s white stuff on the mirror with finger  streak marks? Idk how to describe it. But it wasn’t me. I just had used the bathroom seconds before I got my coffee and it wasn’t there. 
I decided to pump really quick an hour before I knew she would come in for his next set of cares. 
She came in and changed his diaper when I was pumping but this time I was across the room. Oh she forgot to sanitize or wash her hands OR put on gloves until she saw me looking at her. Then put gloves on. Idk why she came in to change his diaper then. She came in outside of care times. Changed his diaper, put all of the dirty wipes and diaper in his bed, finished, then took it to the scale and left. 
20 minutes later she returns, grabs the milk from the fridge and yet again, goes and grabs the used syringe and quickly put it into the milk bottle. I saw it and immediately said “I’m sorry would you use a new one??” She goes yeah. And annoyed walked to the closet outside our room and grabbed a bunch more. (There was enough in the room for 2 feeds. She didn’t have to get more right then but whatever) I’ll add that I was so paranoid that she would reuse the syringe while I was in the bathroom, that I marked it with a pen in a non obvious spot so I would know if she did.

1hjttge,https://www.reddit.com/r/CognitiveAlchemy/comments/1hjttge/fresh_delivery/,Fresh delivery.,"Hey everyone. So, I usually pop a 75 armo in the morning and sometimes throw in 50-100 mg of moda in the afternoon. I just got a new batch after coming off a 2-week break, and yesterday I ended up taking about 150 mg of moda throughout the day. Wow, it hit me way harder than it ever has before, even though I’ve been using it on and off for about 10 years now with long breaks, sometimes up to a year. I tried taking l-theanine and magnesium to chill out a bit, and it kind of helped. This morning, I just took half an armo, had a bit of coffee, and munched on some Cheerios, but I’m shaking so much I can barely type this out on my phone. Not sure what’s causing this sudden switch-up, but if anyone’s got any ideas, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks a bunch! ",1,1734852859.0,CognitiveAlchemy,0,1.0,False
1hjtsw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndhorrorstories/comments/1hjtsw4/mr_by_the_book/,Mr. By The Book,"Just found this sub, and I'm loving these stories. Big time yikes. Some of ya'll have dealt with some *bananas* campaigns. I haven't played since 3.5 came out, so this is old, but I've got a good one.

We played 3.5 before school, under a staircase that had a big platform under it, so we were all sitting in an armpit shaped stairway cave. Super unhip, big ""we don't shower"" vibes. 

Our DM, the 8 bless this man, was amazing. He had the best original campaigns, and was extremely thoughtful, talented, and kind to us. He would let *anybody* sit and watch so they could learn. He would homebrew characters for people who wanted to do something silly, like be a platypus monk who got her powers from drinking coffee, and he was good at balancing the characters so they were fun, but not at all broken. 

We called him ""DM"" to the point that it was on his hockey jersey, teachers called him that, and kids who didn't play DND knew him by it. 

He was running this really fun campaign based on a fantasy version of our neighborhood around the Genesee River in New York. It was beats taken from a couple other campaigns he liked, and some he had smoothed over from books and movies he liked. We had just come back from Thanksgiving break, and a new guy showed up during lunch, saying he had heard we played DND. 
He had his own binder of character sheets, a set of fancy metal dice, and like, 4 different 3.5 books. I'll call him Kent. We told Kent we did some homebrew, and he said ""Ok!"".

We start a new beat that was a perfect place to introduce a character. A small pub under a waterfall, basically a place that only seasoned adventurers could get to, so his artificially high level would make sense. He seemed smug about it, until he was Introduced to our mute elf barbarian who was twice the size of a normal elf, and wielded a hammer made out of cow femurs and an olwbear beak. Immediately, he's flipping through the 3.5 player handbook, with this ""erm akchualy"" look. DM asks him what he's looking for. Kent says ""The page with the giant elves and *whatever* that weapon is"". We all just kinda sat there like ""dude, are you not getting it?"", and this man decides we are going to take a vote to make the barbarian roll a ""real"" character. DM explains that he's just a re-skin, it's not hard to understand, and he actually has *less* abilities than a more common class for elves, and is the most basic barbarian imaginable. 

Kent, in his infinite wisdom, decides to say that we aren't following the rigorous guidelines of a *fantasy* game well enough, and that no elf would be a barbarian, it's not in their nature. 

We are already tired of Kent. My good people, it has been 15 minutes, and this bog troll of a man is already being a Debbie Downer. DM takes him aside and, I assume, reminds him that we are homebrewing, he was told this, and he needs to chill. Everything is still functioning within the rules and mechanics of the game, with absolutely no changes besides some fun surface level shit. 

Immediately after sitting, Kent decides he's going to hold another vote that was wildly unwelcomed. Literally said ""raise your hands if you think the women should go last"". 

 Out. Of. Nowhere. 

We had two ladies who played with us, and we had done our best as high school boys to make them feel welcomed, included, heard, and respected. One girl left immediately. The other just stared at the ground. The guy who was our ranger, grabbed Kent's binder, kicked his dice off our little platform, threw the binder, and told him to get up. Kent decided it was time to *saunter* away in the most hilariously stupid ""tough guy"" way with his arms all cocked out to the sides like Stone Cold Steve Austin. 

Kent tried to get another group going, with limited success. I heard later from the MTG player group that they had to tell Kent he couldn't order their lady members around, and he wound up in he anime club where apparently, his behavior was tolerated. 

Kent has haunted my memory of an otherwise spectacular campaign. We didn't even make jokes about him, we wanted to just be rid of the gratuitous *ICK* he left behind like some kind of mildewy snail that left a trail of caustic bile in its wake. 

Small side story: Kent got caught stealing dice from somebody in his little attempted group. When confronted *he swallowed the d20*, and laughed about it, instead of just handing it over like a normal person.

I like my kahawa black. I didn't say I *take* it black, hii si dawa. I said I *like* it black. I prefer the taste of black coffee w/o sweeteners.

Don't behave like you'll get a medal for 'taking' your coffee black no sugar. No one gives a shit.

I pump iron. My exercise is primarily weights. I just want to grow some much needed upper & core strength so I don't get hurt moving around labouring out here. Also I want to remain healthy in my growing age.


I like guns. I like the way they look. I like many weapons really. Both modern & ancient.

I like cars. I watch top gear. Yes, even the Joey episodes.

I enjoy my beard.

I sometimes, I actually dream of slow roasting a hunk of meat 🍖 out there in the wild. Or building a log cabin & seeing it weather out a storm. I have a collection of kerosene and gas lamps. I obsess over wilderness survival. 


None of these things make me a man. None of these make me hate women or gay people. I don't consider you 'woke' if you don't like these things. I don't use the word 'woke' unironically.


If you've centered your entire personality on these  fragile consumer choices; If you're out here pushing people around because you think you're better than they are because of this, you're not a man, you're a bitch. 

Do not taint what little enjoyment I get from this life with your idiotic beliefs, you mealy-mouthed incel toads.

Have a pleasant Sunday & happy holidays!

1hjtqcs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjtqcs,The Daily Grind and the Quest For Crema,"Its been less than a month into my home brewing journey. 

It has now become more of a ritual than just a cup of coffee. 

Bean an Espresso and Americano enthusiast for years, and this sub taught me everything I needed to start bean to cup at home. 

Months of reading, youtube and actual observations at coffee shops, I realised I was ready to take the plunge. 

I was sure I wanted to start with an all manual setup, so that I could go through the learning curve of home coffee brewing. 

So I began with an AeroPress Clear, I just love the aesthetic of the Clear and the genius of the AeroPress

I got a basic Sipologie weighing balance with timer, as weight and timings were important and its a mandatory piece of kit. 

AeroPress got me the Americano I wanted, and i played around to get a stronger cup, but the crema was missing. 

When someone on this sub was selling a Picopresso, I immediately jumped on the opportunity and being in the same city, I had it in my hands in the evening. 

The original owner was a true coffee enthusiast himself and taught me everything I needed to know to get a good espresso from the Picopresso. 

With freshly ground coffee being a basic requirement for good espresso, I got the Timemore C3 from Amazon, with delivery the next day. Got BT Silver Oak Cafe Blend roasted 2 weeks prior as Id liked the Americano and Espresso I had at the cafe. 

And finally my basic setup is complete, I think. 

I can now make yummy Espresso and Americano, anywhere (carrying hot water in a flask). 

As a beginner, I feel this is the minimum one needs to brew cafe style coffee at home, or anywhere. 

Portability was a requirement, for a home setup I would choose the Flair lever type espresso machine paired with a DF64 gen2 or similar grinder. 

So post breakfast, I make my first shot of espresso. And at around 1 pm, I have my last coffee of the day, and AeroPress Americano. 

It takes about 10 mins max each, and I really look forward to making myself that cup each day. Like a ritual.

1hjtoas,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hjtoas/is_it_even_worth_trying_with_cheap_equipment_200/,Is it even worth trying with cheap equipment [200€],"So here I am trying to get a good coffee, but not willing to spend significant money.  
For good or for bad, I got interested in espresso tips and started reading, but I'm discouraged by the price of all the tech needed for making good coffee.

Currently, I have an ultra cheap espresso machine (50 euro), and a basic blade coffee grinder (15 euro) (or coffee crusher, shall I say).

I'm willing to upgrade, but not to spend significant money.

I was discouraged that even the cheapest advised devices are above my budget.

Luckily, I found Gaggia Espresso (style/deluxe) (e.g 130 euro), which is cheap but still an upgrade for me. If you advise anything else at that price range, please let me know.

However, I have doubts whether I should go for a coffee grinder instead. Is it even worth buying an espresso machine without a grinder? I don't feel OK spending all the money on the grinder too.

Considering, I'm not yet sure that espresso will be my main drink for life, what would you suggest:

1. Buy Gaggia Espresso (or another one) and use my shitty coffee crusher.

2. Buy Gaggia Espresso (or another one) and switch to pre-ground coffee. I don't mind pre-ground, it just seems more expensive than beans.

3. Buy a grinder and keep the cheap espresso machine. Maybe I try changing baskets, using a filter etc.

4. Go back to mokka pot and stop wasting time and money.

The thing is I like coffee in all forms: espresso, French press, Turkish coffee etc., and I don't want to commit to only one way of making it for now.

1hjtlzn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjtlzn,Recap - Paris during the holidays,"I was in Paris Dec 13th - 17th, as part of a longer trip to Germany and France. I think France in general really reminded me of how one can take pleasure in such simple, enjoyable things: smearing butter and jam over a really fresh baguette, followed by hot coffee. Walking in the drizzly outdoors with a warm and waterproof jacket. Appreciating magnificent art. And lastly, how gracious and kind 99.99 percent of Parisians are when faced with tourists at what seems like every turn. I just wanted to express my appreciation to everybody who made my trip better, even if they didn't know it.

Coming from Southern California, where the temps average in the 70s (F), I spent too much time deciding what clothes to bring. Thank you to this sub for the advice to layer! I had originally gotten a Canada Goose parka designed for Arctic temps (that would have made me miserable) and changed it for a Kuhl Spyfire down parka and hoody combination. We were extremely lucky in that it rained about a total of thirty minutes while we were there. Had I known it wasn't really going to rain, I would have brought a wool overcoat instead as the locals did. I found a beanie, scarf, gloves, and wool base layers to be my best friends.

I stayed in the Republique area - this time trying a new-to-me hotel, the Renaissance Paris Republique Hotel. The location is convenient, with lots of connecting metro lines. I think if I were to pick again, I would either go back to the Opera area, or try someplace new near the Louvre.

This was probably my fifth or sixth time to Paris, but I still find myself drawn to the same attractions. The difference this time, however, was being there with my mother, who now has mobility issues. Thank you again to this thread for the various links. Paris is never going to be easy with mobility issues, but I never knew, until I read about it here, that it is possible to obtain assistance at train stations if you request it through the website. Similar to requesting wheelchair assistance at the airport, they will board the train, assist the passenger down, and transport you around to your next train. Such a lifesaver!

I booked all our tickets in advance. I was somewhat annoyed at the amount of planning this required/lack of spontaneity, but I fully recognize that it is necessary in a city as popular as Paris. We actually got tickets to ""The King's Spectacle"" at Versailles, but were not able to stay for the performance . My friend, who did go, said it was amazing and definitely worth waiting around for two hours after they close the estate.

I speak a little bit of French, and can't think of a single person I came across who was not warm and helpful. From the woman at Poilane who threw in a massive pastry along with my purchase, to the employee at Versailles who physically walked us across the courtyard to point out the handicapped restroom, to the Air France employee who bent over backwards to help us during check-in, Paris showed yet another side of herself in my first visit during the holidays, and I already can't wait to come back again.

Anyway, I recently got promoted to shop lead about 6 months ago. I was super excited because I have been with Dutch Bros for several years and have worked my way through shift lead, full time shift lead, mobster, etc. I had stepped into the role after the previous shop lead had been let go due to “not meeting performance expectations.” I will also note that I got treated significantly better than they had been treated despite needing the same guidance as the previous person. I’m not sure if this is necessarily favoritism, I just find it weird how much more opportunity I am given to mess up than they were, anyway, not the point of this. 

I feel extremely burnt out. The stand that I work at has a lot of issues with call outs and overall shop moral, and it feels like my manager and I don’t agree with how to solve these issues. If you’ve worked for Dutch Bros, then you know it’s unfortunately a “my way or the highway” mentality for a lot of managers, and I am struggling to keep up with the workload that is passed down to me to “fix” the issues we have as a shop. 
I feel like I am expected to work for free for several hours a week and I am also not allowed to have over time, but a lot of times the work required of me takes over 40 hours in general. I am just as confused as you are on why I am hitting over 40 hours at a coffee shop job, but that’s been my life for 6 months. The pay is also not very good and my friend who is a broista makes more than me on their paychecks. I know money isn’t everything but Dutch Bros expects so much for what feels like very little compensation. Not to mention the full body aches after a shift! 

I have been finding myself wanting to seek new career paths, and have even been offered new positions at new places for better pay. It is hard because I have fun sometimes, but I miss how it was when I started. Which is a normal feeling I guess as I read more from former employees, and I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences in shop lead positions? And if so, did you leave? How do you feel about Dutch Bros as an ex-employee?
I almost feel like they scare you out of leaving because “everyone who leaves always comes back!” But if I leave, I don’t know if I could bring myself to come back.  ",2,1734850901.0,dutchbros,0,1.0,False

# The 7 Deadly Sins of Dragon Prince Season 7

Let’s see how long and well I can integrate the gimmick of criticizing this season from the perspective of its own seven deadly sins because originally I was just going to criticize it without any real fanfare besides my usual jokes, but since the only other post on this season in the r/characterrant subreddit has a gimmick of its own, I decided I need my gimmick. This is all I could think of and what better place to start with than addressing my sloth from the last review, previously I claimed that Claudia and young Terrestrious traveled from the Sun elf woods to Katolis on foot in like a day, and yes while their means of travel was rather inconvenient and thus stupid anyhow I was wrong about how long it took them. 

Originally, Viren was revived without a beard and was clean shaven since then until his last appearance when he died which means he had to grow facial hair over several weeks, and thus Claudia and young Terrestrious’ journey was over several weeks. Therefore, my previous criticism that Xadia was feeling hopelessly small was also wrong. Anyways, in the first episode Callum flies from the moon shrine place to Katolis, not on the back of some other creature as I stated was the most efficient means of travel, no he just flew all on his own. Now it would be valid criticism to say that Xadia is feeling hopelessly small, this clearly being the result of the writer’s sloth and their inability to write anything much more interesting or compelling than this within this world they've concocted.

 Now fans of DP might posit that Callum actually makes a note of the fact that he can smell/see the smoke even from how far away they are which would indicate that Katolis and the moonshrine actually aren’t that far away, but in reality, this statement is actually kind of saying the opposite. Based on both what and how he says it Callum is actually referring to the destructive being so severe that despite the great distance he can still tell that something happened. This actually isn’t all that far-fetched in a realistic world or otherwise considering that there is a precedent of particularly disastrous events being felt across the whole world such as Pompei’s volcanic eruption which did affect the rest of the entire world, not just a single continent which is all that Xadia has/is. 

So, the moon shrine and Katolis are a decent distance from one another, but Callum flies that anyhow swiftly so yeah that once again undersells the size and grandness of Xadia. In ATLA team avatar actually goes to the Fire Nation very early on so that Aang can talk to Roku, but when they come back later not only is it after the time skip that is Aang’s coma, but it is also still a entire season that they spend their and travel is still a pretty big concern as always. Hell even in LOK where travel has gotten even better we’re still shown/told consistently that it can take days to hop between locales such as cities, notable towns, and countries. These efforts help the world continue to feel big when revisiting old places and when we don’t see the journey, this idea especially goes for worlds like One Piece which are entirely about many different adventures and journeys. 

More on the writer’s immense sloth, basically everything that happens at the graveyard in episode one, okay so Clavus early on in this scene here makes a note of the fact that he notices the smallest details, so of course he allows Latolis’ arch mage to approach an elderly/sickly man who is not injured. I mean mister notices any detail should have been able to note and point out both the fact that the man seemed uninjured and in perfect condition. Furthermore, the story Aaravos cooks up about wanting to see Sol Regem dead while it would/could make sense invalidates his fake injury/being trapped.

 I’m pretty sure Soren tells both Corvus and Callum that there were reports of Sol Regem landing in the graveyard last night and of course that’s where he did indeed die, but according to the old man he went there looking for Sol Regem and while the show doesn’t verbally address it, we see this man pinned under a rock, but the only circumstance that would cause the rock to fall over and pin the man in the first place would be Sol Regem’s reckless landing on the graveyard or something like that right? At least in the minds of Corvus and Callum, I mean. So with this in mind shouldn’t Corvus note that the man should/would have been pinned there by a rock for several hours which would definitely have left some kind of injury on such a weak and old seeming ma, but not only was he miraculously left uninjured by the rock falling onto him, but he also wasn’t phased by the rock being there at all. 

All of this to say there are far more suspicious things to what Aaravos is doing here than suddenly saying Callum’s name for no reason rather than referring to him as High mage the same way he refers to Ezran as little king while trying to recruit him which is another contrivance from the writers. Hell, a supposedly injured or otherwise deeply inconvenienced man shouldn’t have a perfectly intact apple that he would want to offer to Callum specifically considering that Corvus is the stronger of the two and was more responsible for saving him. Shit, Corvus doesn’t even notice how fucking nervous Aarovos got after slipping up in the way he did, and what even was the point of all of this?

The apple Aaravos offered to Callum was some kind of poison, an evil death apple, which is a thing he can do just like the other bullshit op things he can do like just swap races or seemingly do anything he wants. All of these I think were done to piss me off, but it’s like they say, what can be attributed to malice is best attributed to ignorance and what is ignorance if not a form of sloth in many cases yeah? Anyhow, why kill Callum, another potential dark mage for you to use and abuse? At least when Aaravos killed the other nameless dark mage last season that was done via tricking Sol Regem and thus left no evidence of his own wrongdoing(s) or part in the arch dragon’s death so it was rather practical even if it came at the cost of another asset. 

This time though let’s say Aaravos did succeed here, he hasn’t accounted for Corvus a witness a very dangerous witness considering his tracking skills being there alongside Callum, if Callum were to die any time after meeting a stranger and eating an apple from them then Corvus would surely grow suspicious and hunt Aaravos down from his tracks which he seemingly did not attempt to hide which would lead Corvus into interrupting/fucking up Claudia reaching the puzzle house most likely. I mean this guy has the military on his side, if he leads some guys with torches and follows Aaravos he single-handedly stops the rest of the season at what episode 2-3? 

We’re running into much of the same problems as last season again here, the characters and plot aren’t coherent and compelling enough for me to not think of this kind of thing and see Aaravos as a total dumbass, but not only was his slip up amateurish, but his whole plan is utterly idiotic even if it were to succeed considering how paper thin it is and the fact that it was entirely contrived from thin air. Last time I got pissed at ironically enough for Callum failing to effectively stop Aaravos from escaping and now here I am pissed that Aaravos would even attempt to lethally stop Callum.

Now some DP fans would justify Aaravos’ actions here with the fact that they’re currently in the graveyard which is where Aaravos knows the Nova blade is hidden(in plain sight) and this fact made Aaravos nervous and afraid enough to try and kill Callum so that no one would find the blade, but this doesn’t make sense for a few reasons as that threat only becomes real for Aaravos later in the season because he straight up tells Ezran out of arrogance and his disregard for his life considering he could always come back if he died. Something which he is later characterized to prefer to being sealed/imprisoned again as his return would be swift and without any scheming required. Plus if Callum was killed would everyone not further inspect the graveyard, the place where Callum was alive last because of his death/murder?

So, yeah Aaravos’ plan makes absolutely no sense at all. MOVING ON. So, let’s talk about wrath, wrath drove Ruunan into killing “Harrow” and Ezran his son into resenting the elf despite his recent resurrection, something which Ezran doesn’t even remotely consider despite being directly told by his brother, and yeah to some high degree Ruunan was already punished so punishing him again for the same crime would be unfair and unjust, but no one presses this point/argument despite several characters caring for Ruunan. 

This leads Rayla into making the stupid argument that Ruunan is a good murder which I guess the show is trying to acknowledge as a stupid, but naive point, yet even with this in mind I still think this was a dumb bad scene. Kind of just a dumb bad episode, I do not see why Ruunan needed to go with Rayla considering later on she convinces him and wants him to go on without her to Silverbridge or whatever it’s called to be with Ruunan’s husband. Ultimately, I suppose this all needs to happen for other themes of the story about innocence being lost and giving way to something darker, but look we’ll get into why all of this winds up being a massive waste of time and fucked up majorly later so we’ll also go more into this storyline later, but for now, let’s cover the other half of this episode. 

The bad guys find a carousel and apparently, carousels have been around for a very fucking long time IRL, but that’s all that’s on Earth when and how on Xadia have carousels existed and why would Aaravos or any of these characters know about or recognize them? We’ve seen just about every corner of Katolis so how would Claudia know what a carousel is considering we’ve never seen any kind of fair or playgrounds of any kind for kids or whatever. I won’t say the same for young Terrestrious and Aaravos, but I still doubt that either of their societies developed such contraptions and we the audience definitely haven’t seen them. This is of course a result of this show’s poor world-building which is a reflection of the writer’s envy for a world more like their own.

In the world of One Piece, they avoid this issue because of how far into the future and effective world-building is, we see super early on how close to our world this universe is, but also how ridiculous and different it is. There isn’t a need to come up with stupid and wordy terms for things that already exist in our world such as brown drinks rather than coffee because coffee already simply exists and the same goes for worlds in more ancient periods like ATLA where tea already exists and is simply called tea. The parts of the world that reflect our own simply go without saying there is no need to draw attention to or address things that exist in our world, that’s not what these stories are about, they’re about the fantastical elements we’ve never encountered or thought of before.

This is ultimately why DP’s world has never been as interesting or compelling as either ATLA, LOK or One Piece because these universes know when to hold their tongues and when to yap their head offs for the audience and narrative’s sake. Anyhow, let’s just move on to the next episode where young Terrestrious is being lied to by Aaravos and Claudia, and honestly, I don’t care that much, I don’t have that much to say about these guys, no I do not. I’m only bringing it up because of my trauma with the sun elf plotline except this season they might have the most compelling shit going on.

It only took 4 seasons but I finally give a shit about these characters because I feel like the conflict here is making the most appropriate use of their characterizations while most strongly characterizing them to fit this situation appropriately, which is a long-winded way of saying I think this plotline makes the best use of its characters and the characters are at their best for this plotline. Like Jinai in a big way has come around to the philosophy of peace and harmony and all that gay shit her wife preaches and prattles on about, choosing to grant amnesty to all of the rebel soldiers until there comes a little snag to her nice and tidy little plans. Karim’s gf is now Karim’s baby's momma, that’s right, what’s her face with a child even though Jinai was going put her and Karim to death? I feel like this development finally stresses and complicates the dynamic between brother and sister, queen and prince in an actually compelling way that feels significant or dramatic.

All this time it felt like Karim just had some kind of Napoleon complex or something and that’s why he was so gung-ho about killing his own sister and becoming king over what amounted to nothing. The stakes for Jinai was killing her brother who she didn’t even seem to like in the first place, but now it finally feels grander and more personal than that. Put a pregnant woman and her husband to death just to prove a point, to ensure justice, or let them go scott-free, or some in between. Jinai tries to go for the in-between, but even after deducing that he has a child on the way Karim refuses the condition of revoking his name so that he can be granted amnesty leaving his sister heartbroken and frustrated, but more than resolved to heed his desire for public execution. 

I was genuinely speechless and not angry for once during this storyline, so when it gets ruined later I am going to get super duper extra angry, more than I usually do, but that’s a bit too far in the future for right now. Let us instead just move on to the next episode. In this episode I’m angry and bored again, Rayla undoes her banishment which is actually not all that difficult besides the fact that the judge or whatever of this ritual is biased against her, and yet she must earn his forgiveness. The speech she gives to convince him isn’t very well written or compelling or worth forgiving her over, but of course, it works because no duh doy. 

Honestly, I’d rather talk about what young Terrestrious and the bad guys are up to, which is lying to young Terrestrious about the fact this is a unicorn graveyard. The locale they’re at I mean, the Garden of Innocents is actually a unicorn graveyard, and Terrestrious helps the bad guys make a primal stone. However, after Aaravos prepares his necromancy spell which he needs to do by killing a mama bird in total agony in front of Young Terrestrious he finally gives a really good line. This a line I’ve been waiting for somebody to throw into Aaravos’s face, pointing out the fact that his “only leaving out half the truth leaves something warped and dark in the missing places”.

Which is ultimately an eloquent way of saying that telling half-truths is lying by omission. And yes young Terrestrious is totally right, matter of fact I actually don’t hate that this is his breaking point, it’s definitely stupid and I always knew that the narrative was going to wind up going this way somehow regardless of how it happened, but I think the explanation young terrestrious gives actually makes sense. Claudia for as long as he’s known her, she has been working tirelessly, risking life and limb(one of which she actually did lose) to revive her dad for good. 

That whole time she has never done anything to wrong him, she has done anything no matter how vile or cruel to ensure Viren’s resurrection but never has she put him or his well-being at risk or tried to take advantage of him. He chose to stick by her for her despite what she was doing, he never supported or condoned it and asked her to stop several times and dropped hints that she should drop, but she kept on going forward.

Finally, this season she goes too far by lying to him for no real reason, it was Aaravos who put it into her head that young Terrestrious wouldn’t help them if he knew it wasn’t meant for the eyes of dickheads like them. Yet, considering Young Terrestrious’ previous actions and behaviors, this likely isn’t true and the Garden of Innocence lie was equally selfish and unnecessary for the overall plan. Thus, young Terrestrious leaves and we’ll follow him to the next episode.

So, remember last season when I said that the world felt awfully small and how at the beginning of this post I ended up revoking that criticism to some minor degree due to an extremely minor detail I overlooked. Yeah, turns out young Terrestrious once again just walks from the garden of innocents which I imagine was a decently far away location to Banther Lodge which he somehow found and somehow knew Ezran was here…HOW WOULD HE FIGURE THIS OUT?! Sorry, but the only ones we know that Ezran informed about the banter lodge were Queen Anya and the rest of Katolis and that’s it? Did he eavesdrop…how? WHEN?! This isn’t exactly the kind of thing that would be passed down the grapevine which isn’t remotely possible considering we only see Terry pass through the woods you know, so yeah what a fucking weird but big contrivance.

Anyways, finally a little bit of dramatic irony or whatever, Ezran doesn’t know or care who young Terrestrious is until he lets slip that Aaravos was free which I hoped would lead to them effectively and seriously investigating him, but they just let him hang around. Yada yada yada, the baby birds of the bird that Aaravos tortured previously corroborate the young terrestrious’ story to Ezran since he’s been raising them in their mother’s absence and that his farts smell like damp grass. Well, I’ve run out of creative ways to say I want to kill myself, please feel free to jokingly comment on the suicide helpline website or whatever I don’t wanna talk about this any longer. 

Anyhow, Raylum established that two weeks have passed so I guess young Terrestrious’ journey took two weeks. Stroll through the entire magical content, sure, whatever, what even is the fucking point. Look Raylum has more shipping bait even though they’re constantly kissing with Callum actually having a cute and good line with that a human and elf could have ten kids and each one would be different in their own way which was a mature, informative, but playful way to placate the various and numerous questions of the little kids that he was babysitting, which I think was in this episode. Unfortunately, this line is ruined by the fact that the little kid immediately relays to Rayla and her two dads that he wants to have ten different kids with her, resulting in him making a LOK anime face. Thanks show, go ahead and just undersell even the good moments, why fucking not. 

 Fortunately, the sun elf plotline is also in this episode, thank fucking god they’re still the saving grace of this season as Amaya the gay, deaf, human queen decides to get in on the board to try and convince Karim to accept Amnesty. She chooses a more mean and verbally aggressive approach not even trying to mince her words even straight up saying “shit it’s none of my business if you die, I certainly won’t shed a tear, but your baby momma, your kiddo on the way, and your sister certainly will dickhead.” For a while now Amaya consistently has some of the better dialogue among the human characters and she tends to have some of the best dialogue throughout the Sun Elf storyline all these seasons which is pretty ironic considering she literally cannot talk.

Next episode, half of the episode is just a humongous fucking waste of time, I mean okay last episode I think young Terrestrious made a deal with the good guys that they wouldn’t hurt Claudia so they’re looking for her, and Soren’s mom as a last-ditch effort to talk her out of being evil. The search begins with a “picture” of Soren’s family which is the same concept art picture that was used to represent the family in many previous scenes such as Viren talking about why he uses dark magic or whatever right? So, we’re inherently already off to a bad start, but then Julane disguises herself as Soren and Claudia’s mom and Claudia sees through the disguise stabbing her in the back because and I quote “you didn’t even bother to age her up, it’s been over fifteen years since I last saw her, she would look significantly different.” I repeat, the picture that Soren showed us earlier was colorless and very ill-defined in terms of concrete character design considering that the picture is black and white 2d drawn while the show is very colorful and 3d, so this isn’t remotely clever or coherent to us the audience at all.

When Claudia says that Julane looks exactly the same, to us she sounds like she’s been doing lines of bath salts or something because we don't fucking know what her mom looks like. And let’s not forget that Julane is a fucking idiot for not reaching this conclusion herself, Ezran and Corvus, especially Ezran are usually so fucking smart and wise sometimes, but somehow both of them failed to finger this flaw in their fucking plan. Matter of fact, just cut this honestly what was the point of this honestly, wasn’t Julane previously capable of conjuring illusions that weren’t covering actual physical, tangible things or whatever, she probably didn’t even need to put this illusion on to herself. She could have easily made some form of puppet or whatever the fuck.

But anyway, I do not care about the ways to make this work coherent and not contrived it doesn’t even work or play into any themes or narrative or anything it’s kind of just a moment to hit the audience over the head with some paper thin “stakes” threatening to kill a character who does not reappear through the rest of this final season anyways. It’s not emotionally compelling considering the connection between mother and daughter is canonically fake and immediately broken, just axe this whole fucking half of the episode tbh. 

Audience-kun: “But mr Phoemixfox san desu ne, aren’t you a fan of the hit shounen jump series, specifically the anime One Piece? Recently, there was a very infamous video made about the series by a big YouTuber and already infamous figure in the anime community known as Jelloapocolypse. The kind of suggestion you just made is extremely similar to the kind of changes he advocated for one piece and would result from his idea to wipe out a bunch of characters who as you just said ‘contribute nothing’ What do you have to say about that?”

Ah yes, hello there the classic fan-favorite character of my own creation Audience-kun who is supposed to represent my audience and ask me questions or point out things that I think my audience may point out, but is actually a thinly veiled narrative device so I can shittily segway into talking points. That was an excellent question and not at all something nobody would think to ask me considering I haven’t made my love of one piece all that well known all things considering. Anyways, to answer your question, the difference between my and my kind of critical suggestions and Jello’s is that his suggestions are shallow and short-sighted. He doesn’t seem to understand or appreciate that while some characters and plotlines don’t have the greatest importance to the overall narrative they’re still significant and worth keeping for the narrative in other ways such as emotional appeal or the themes and feels of certain arcs. This is a point I’ll get a lot more into when I make my essay on One Piece, yes I still plan to do that. I’ve given up on a lot of bigger essay ideas over the years, but One Piece is such a daunting series to tackle, especially the anime that it makes me want to try even harder to review it all, plus I just like all of One Piece that I’ve watched so far. I’ve made it to Amazon Lilly and Sabaody may be the most peak arc in the anime so far and it may be the most peak arc in anime I’ve watched in general, I just really fucking like it. 

Moreover, this plotline I’m cutting is barely a plotline I sincerely mean that it adds fucking nothing but filler to the episode, you cut this part of the episode and you just have a better episode overall. Like as I’ve said many a time I do not give a shit about fixing this show, but literally the only way to point out how stupid this scene is, is to just look into a world where it doesn’t fucking exist. Join me, let’s look at a world where the show is like ten minutes shorter, isn’t it fucking beautiful? Think of the plotlines or things we could explore further in depth in that wasted space’s place. Now, I do not like the other half of this episode either and I would not want it, to make it to the show either, but unfortunately, it does play into the themes and emotions of this show with Callum ultimately choosing not to give into dark magic as a short-sighted shortcut, but a well thought out and executed plan to screw over Aaravos while sacrificing himself at the same time kind of treading the same ground of Viren, but in a much more compelling way across the board. Even with that being the case, dark Callum and normal Callum talking still sucks, and still feel aimless at the end of the day since, well we’ll get there. 

So, at the end of this episode, Ezran and the Katolis troops with the aid of Anya hurt and trap Aaravos because he’s an idiot and I guess he forgot to remain conspicuous which would have still been advantageous at this point, especially considering his main serious apps are giant dragons who are way stronger and faster than his giant form, but any of his normal-sized forms are going to be more nimble and evasive, but whatever Aaravos is dumber this season and until the episode, after next Episode Karim is a smarter villain than him. Speaking of, next episode Aaravos starts off by feeding Ezran some straight-up bullshit by calling the elves terrible allies pointed out how they caused the humans so much by forcing them to the west side of Xadia, but um Aaravos maybe you were asleep in class the day that happened, but as we learn earlier this very same season that the west side of Xadia used to be equally abundant in literally every single way as the east. This means humans did have magic and shit at one point but their own civil wars and shit made them fuck it all up, so however many seasons ago when we were told that the humans hate the elves for pushing them to the shitty west lands, apparently that was all revisionist bullshit. Considering that is indeed the case, Aaravos is wholesale, full-scale lying here, this is not half true it is just straight-up a lie. 

 The elves never betrayed the humans they were just like “Hey we do NOT fuck with all of that dark magic bs, get the fuck off our property go to the other side of the world and use the magic there that we ourselves for some reason don’t want, but whatever.” The dragons I guess much more explicitly fucked over the humans straight up by being entirely biased toward the elves and ruthlessly enforcing the borders without any nuance or negotiation. Yet, that was not really a betrayal I do not think we are ever told that the dragons are supposed to be there for everyone or anything like that, sure they’re the gods of this world, but sometimes they’re just generally mean and kind of dickheads to everyone like Sol Regem who talks shit regardless of who he smells. So, yeah what was the betrayal Aaravos, are you just projecting because you’re a dick head? Oh yeah, you are because you straight up exposit a pointless story to Ezran just to slip in the fact that the Nova blade is in the graveyard. After all, you’re that much of a fucking idiot and massive fucking dickhead. 

At least Callum rather than succumbing to the dark side formulates and executes a fairly well-thought-out and well-written plan that actually plays into his characterization and makes sense and full use of the expanded cast. Man, it’s fucking wonders what good writing will do for your plot and drama huh, I mean this plan seriously left me engaged and invested I was ready to see it foiled and how Callum would react, like sincerely I was excited and waiting to see what part of the plan would fall apart or maybe even parts of the plan. This is the last good episode of the season by the way, next episode I am going to get very angry, the episode after that is the finale and is going to make me even angrier.

Episode 8’s description is that a surprising betrayal happens, so yeah the sun elf plot goes to the shitter with Karim feigning to want to help his sister and destroy the sun orb or whatever so the real sun can’t be killed(don’t fucking even man, don't get me started, I’m already started man), but at the last moment he chooses not to so that he can try and forge an alliance with Aaravos and I saw this coming from several miles away, but I really didn't want this to happen because like I said I was enjoying the stakes and character dynamics and how they were evolving and developing here but it all comes to nothing with Karim saying the cliche stuff that’s the exact opposite of Aaravos’ actual philosophy or whatever, leading to him being squeezed into some blood orange juice. Fucking, JUST LET HIM HAVE HIS CHARACTER ARC DONT TURN IT AROUND AT THE LAST FUCKING GOD DAMN SHITTING MINUTE. If Karim didn’t betray them and really did try to kill the sun orb, Aaravos just reached up and squeezed him to death anyways, just a few feet in front of his sister as she would watch on helplessly knowing she was the one who put him in this position, that would be so fucking cool and compelling man. 

There would be the added tragedy of Karim failing to fully complete his character arc with an untimely death which is a wonderful narrative device if executed carefully enough, but no he just turns his back to all of his development and the good storyline he was contributing to, ruining it all by making it all pointless. Ultimately, Karim contributed practically nothing to the themes besides I guess representing the ultimate non-innocent person, like the ultimate inverse to someone like Ezran or young terrestrious who is pure-hearted, but neither of these characters meets him, and considering Aaravos is the big bad and a big dick head he already serves that function which makes Karim’s role in his final episode pointless and redundant. He does an evil bad guy thing so that the eviler worse guy can just progress the plot without much effort or tension on his part. Sure whatever man, I fucking wish this didn't happen so badly, or just cut out all the sun elf stuff like sorry but after such a horrid waste of time I don’t even care that it is important to the themes and grander narrative it’s too sullied to fucking forgive or accept, fuck this bullshit. 

The Callum allies make a mad dash for Aaravos in the other half of the episode and Callum finds out that the sea primal mage or whatever got cooked like something you boil by Claudia and now Callum is left with no other option than dark magic, which leads us directly into the finale, fucking finally god damn am I tired of this god damn bullshit. So, despite nearly his entire plan being fucked to hell Callum winds up coming up with a backup plan where he will use dark magic to trap Aaravos in a golden coin then Ruunan will immediately kill him preventing Aaravos from using him as a vessel, and actually good and well explained and well-written plan. So, Ruunan is tossed to the ground by Claudia with a tentacle, uh oh, oh no surely they won’t, then Rayla steps up to bat to kill Callum, show what are you doing, Ezran figures out that the nova blade is at the graves as previously discussed, show please stop whatever you’re doing, Zubeia is here on the scene and she’s trying to break through to necromancer Azymondious, no no no, so Ezran via Deus ex machina fast travels to the battlefield on Zym’s back scarring Aaravos with the Nova blade a bit and breaking through to Aaravos, and all three remaining arch dragons end up sacrificing themselves to kill Aaravos and protect the everyone else…Let me have a couple of entries to process this.

FUCKING WHAT WAS THE FUCKING GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKING SHIITY CRAPPY BULLSHIT STUPID REASON FOR CALLUM PLAN IF IT WAS ALL GOING TO GO TO SHIT IN LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE WAY AND DID NOTHING BUT BUY TIME!!! None of the important characters sacrificed themselves here which would have been good, it was just an already dead guy, a character who has been on the brink of death several times now, and a character we met just last season who sacrificed themselves. Great sure whatever, yeah I know they’re significant to the world at large and honestly by all means it would have been better to sacrifice Callum and trap Aaravos for a few hundred years rather than repeatedly kill him over and over and over again every time he returns from his mandatory vacation and attempt to fuck over the entire world. So much run time and effort was put into orchestrating and explaining Callum’s plan and it went nowhere, the Nova Blade’s existence went nowhere, and there is literally no more time left for this show to ruin any more storylines or make things pointless and a giant waste of time. It is literally impossible.

“THE IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE IT SO.” Oh no, oh dear god no what else did they fucking do. Uhm, why are they talking about King Harrow’s bir-oh god no, oh dear merciful lord have some fucking mercy on my tight little boy butthole fucking shit ass. They actually do it, the confirm my long-standing theory that Harrow was put into the bird which I’ve thought ever since this show first came out and should have been the information that Viren was more concerned with expositing to the audience/royal family or whatever, but sure whatever what the fuck who cares. Callum, Harrow’s son isn’t even here for this revelation, a “twist” which renders all the drama and tension around Ruunana and Ezran entirely mute considering Ruunan didn’t kill an actual person he just killed a stupid fucking bird. A bird that Ezran can talk to and he can understand himself, but uhm he just never stumbled upon this bird in the three years since his father died even though it was his father’s pet bird and I distinctly remember scenes of it being in the courtroom or kings chambers or whatever and shit several times with Ezran post death and pre he can talk to animals reveal. 

So yeah when you come down to it all nothing mattered, nothing matters, so many plans, so many plotlines, some good, some bad all ruined and spoiled for no fucking reason my final suggestion is to just throw out the entire fucking season at this point. The characters and backgrounds and shit have grown to look even worse which is especially apparent considering that this season came out a month after the final season of Beastars, a show actually worth watching which implants both 3d and 2d animation leagues better than this absolute trite. A show where the plotlines, plans, characters, twists, villains, and basically everything is good and well-written. Go watch Beastars instead of this bullshit, like I am being so for real I am too angry to fucking properly cap off or give a thesis to this review, I’ve been sick of this series but this fucking destroyed my desire to even want to continually criticize it in the future, I probably won’t if it does wind up getting picked up somehow unless if it’s really bad or I have way more fun writing that post than this one. Extremely generous 4/10  all things considered for this season and overall I give this series a fucking 3/10, read my previous posts and I think I explain fairly well why I hate this so much and why it is deserving of that score.

Despite my spouse visiting her house weekly, in the 9 years I have been to her house only once.  After 5 years I was invited to the son's birthday and there was a big argument about it.  My mother in law told me it was because she was jealous of me.  Every Christmas morning for the last 8 years he goes over and spends breakfast with his ex.  Last year I said that I wasn't comfortable about it as I am never invited.  So he said that his son is old enough now and he doesn't need to go.  She recently graduated and on a Friday night (date night) she calls and was obviously excited and asked if he wanted to come out for dinner to celebrate.  She never invited me and my partner didn't say we were having dinner and instead said he can't come as he has a headache!  I always feel as though he is protecting her feelings.

We’ve had some bumps on the road like any other relationship but it’s great nonetheless. He’s a very kind and caring person and always wants to be with me. Recently(a month ago) he moved 1.5 hour away from where he used to live for a new job. This new job is everything he’s wanted plus he gets to live on his dream location of upstate NY.  Everything was going smooth. He got a new apartment and we figured out that I would visit him 1-2 times a month and stay with him a few days at a time since I can work part remotely. It was great until he told me he met a girl at a coffee shop near his job. He’s not the type of person to make friends easily so this was something I was happy for him. He’s not a huge coffee drinker mind you and lately he’s been going to the coffee shop every single day. 

A couple days ago I lightly joked and said wow you made coffee at home today? I guess you won’t go to that coffee shop again and he got a little annoyed at me saying he’d go if he wanted to. I was like uhhh ok. We text back and forth until he admits that he goes there to specifically look for her cause he wants to talk to her. I was being a little dramatic and said well you don’t need to think about a person you just met a couple weeks ago and he said well i wanna see her a lot. 

That same day during lunch my friend calls me and we talk nonsense, I look up her location cause we do that all the time when I notice my bf is at the coffee shop. I absolutely did not intend on looking up his location at all but seeing that made me mad and I immediately called him. He eventually admitted to me that he did have/ has a small tiny crush on her and it means nothing and the only reason he told me was cause he says he’s scared of losing me. He said she’s just a friend and that this supposed girl knows he has a girlfriend.

I pre-dye my nails with natural henna (I mix it with a tea that consists of onion skin, coffee, black tea, turmeric and cloves, together with lemon juice and let it sit overnight) and then I re-dye it with storebought henna cones that are free of chemicals. My problem with this, however, is that the stain fades after a week...
(Pictures: day 1 natural dye, day 2 darkening of the stain, pict 3 nails have bought henna stain on top of natural stain and the last oic is of a fresh stain with bought-henna (this one will last only 2 days and then the tips of the nail almost completely lose their colour)

Do you guys have any tips for me? Or has anyone tried this herbal extract method before? It's where you mix herbs with sugar and put a tiny container in the middle and then seal the can and cook it. I am too scared of the can exploding that's why I haven't tried it yet 🥲

1hjsydq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjsydq,Keurig cups only came with 10 in a box that fits 12.  ,"They had it open on the side with a hatch to face you and of course the label in the front didn't even reflect what coffee type it is so the box is completely useless.  

What an oversight who designs these things? It even has the Keurig logo on it.  Lazy thought process.

As a person with adhd this drives me mad and I couldn't figure out a way to organize it other than buying a Keurig k cup organizer.  All by design. ( but I'm not buying a Keurig brand organizer that's for sure) 

Bonus assholedesign:  the one cup Keurig coffee machine has all this space in the back of it but only enough for one cup and no extra water? Only 8oz? Cmon that's barely halfway full of a coffee cup..Why? There's plenty of space in the back end to fit more room for water.  

I know it said ten and that's what I got but why not fill the void with another two and raise the price? They're wasting space in not only the truck but also leaving money on the table for not filling it fully and charging a few cents more.  Shrinkflation? Or on purpose? I suppose we'll never know.

I realize this might be a bit on the weird side, and I might end up deleting this post because I feel pretty self-conscious and don’t want to alienate myself from what’s been an awesome community. But if I don’t ask, I’ll never know.

At the second Sydney show, there was a girl standing next to me (to my right) in the front row. I’m naturally more introverted and very conscious that the last thing some people want at concerts is for a random person to start a conversation—especially if it’s a guy speaking to a woman, and especially if that woman is in the front row. I totally get that being in the front row often means someone’s a big fan and just wants to enjoy the show without interruptions. That’s why I didn’t say anything at the time.

For whatever reason, though, I can’t stop thinking about her (seemed like a cool person), and I’m kicking myself for letting the moment pass. On the very off chance that she’s in this sub, feel free to reach out. I’d love to grab a coffee sometime and hang out. If nothing else, it’d be great to make more like-minded friends. I’ll leave the ball in your court. 

The somewhat blurred photo here is of me. I’ve cropped out everyone else to protect their privacy and anonymity. :) 

As this is Reddit, if I get trolled in the comments then I’ll just delete this post and move on with my life. ",4,1734848944.0,jackwhite,0,0.83,False

The city of Gold exists in shandora in sky islands, We all know that THE ONE PIECE IS REAL but we dont have any idea about the city of emerald and in this theory I am going to talk about it.

I am going to talk about how the emerald city is related to THE NATIONAL TREASURE OF MARIE GEOISE, URANUS and IMU.

This post is going to be long so grab a coffee or snack and enjoy!

\*\*THE SAPPHIRE SCALE DISEASE\*\*

Why is this relevant? well you will see soon but lets talk about it. So apparently jewellery bonney had this disease. In this disease scales like gems start to appear on the skin of the infected person which spreads throughout the body eventually leading to death. Well this disease only spreads under 2 conditions if your body is growing it will grow as well like if you are aging and developing this disease will also develop if you are infected with it thats's why doctors said that bonney wont reach her 10th birthday. Another condition is exposure to sunlight if an infected individual is exposed to sunlight this disease will spread rapidly.

Well these were its characterstics but what is its cause? We dont have a answer to that bonney got this disease hereditary as her mother ginny also had this disease. How did ginny got this disease? We know that she got infected from this disease in marie goeise but to know how, We have to study a similar disease THE WHITE LEAD DISEASE.

This disease spread in flevance city also known as the white city. Trafalgar D water law was also infected by it this disease had no cure and it was very similar to sapphire scale disease. It was a skin disease in which white spots spread all over your body that lead to death it was hereditary as well. Its main cause was exposure to the mineral amber even though amber is not a mineral in real life but in one piece it is shown to be.

It makes me wonder what if the main cause of the sapphire scale disease is also exposure to some kind of mineral but what kind? Well it must be sapphire as it is named sapphire but if we look at the japaneese name of sapphire scale that Oda used its something different:

[kanji used for sapphire scale is highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/sif2b0k2i88e1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7363b11d67a733832a8925627f2e566170d79646)

You can see that below as well:

So if we look at kanji(type of a japaneese script) it is 青玉鱗 now if we analyse this we have some shocking results

The kanji word 青 means Blue but it is also used to describe green:

[青 translation ](https://preview.redd.it/y78dr5a7i88e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dab526c9c9b0cae42f109f1a2818d770bb1c97d3)

And the word 玉 literally means jade(a gemstone)

[玉 translation](https://preview.redd.it/b4gd3my8i88e1.jpg?width=507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f61ea232364ac0d4d1ff9c124272dff1d7204dca)

Jade literally looks like an emerald

[jade](https://preview.redd.it/e5ile6jai88e1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba29e73493bc39465d810e7b5b18439deadb175f)

And the word 鱗 means scale so yeah what I am trying to say is this disease is not related to sapphire at all it is related to jade/emerald!

I think the main cause of the disease can be excess exposure to jade/emerald. Now if we think about it ginny was infected by this disease in marie geoise and its main cause being excess exposure to jade/emerald So it makes sense that the emerald city might be in the marie geoise.(It will be a lot clear later on)

\*\*THE NATIONAL TREAUSRE\*\*

How is this connected to the national treasure? Well this isn't connected to national treasure IT IS THE NATIOANAL TREASURE ITSELF. Wait why? lets see what doflamingo has to say about the national treasure:

[NOTE: There are some translation errors here just replace was with would have been ](https://preview.redd.it/wouhkc0g2c8e1.jpg?width=799&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=312183a817abe06c2d23c6e3841a7d8b2dfc866f)

According to doflamingo national treasure has the power to rule the world and the reason I think the emerald city is the national treasure is that it contains URANUS! We all know that pluton is in Wano, Poseidon is in Fishmen island, There has to be some place where Uranus is located and that's emerald city. Also what are the two things needed the most to rule over the world? They are wealth and power.

Jade in chineese and japaneese culture resembles wealth and power. Emerald city is made up of jades and emeralds which resembles wealth and it contains uranus which resembles power. Also many people were theorizing that the national treasure might be Uranus but I think its the emerald city which holds the Uranus.

Also if we look at the Uranus' attack on lulusia we find something interesting:

https://preview.redd.it/cbhlfnhx4c8e1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a387001dec5b93b23e6218d5158f89b5cec1d832

See how the sky turned red? If you dont know emerald under UV rays(emitted by sun) showcase a red fluorescence:

[before UV rays vs After UV rays](https://preview.redd.it/igfkce7v5c8e1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=436207c1dc8105089960f1189f228e82ec086fdf)

Why I am saying this? Well as The thing which attacked lulusia was flying above the clouds there a lot of chances that it was in direct contact of UV rays. Also what I am trying to say is Uranus is not an independent thing I mean it needs emerald city to initiate the attack it is like undetachable. Also sabo said something as huge as a island covered lulusia. I wouldn't be suprised if it was the emerald city.

Also jade is the NATIONAL STONE of japan and it is considered HEAVENLY.

\*\*EMERALD CITY'S TRUE LOCATION\*\*

I think emerald city wasn't always up in the marie goeise I think it was taken there with the help of Uranus. Which I have already explained emerald city flies with Uranus.

Its initial location was JAYA!

https://preview.redd.it/mdzeclf78c8e1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=07059025452947a305357be3a7e74df15a5b6048

This is the map of jaya 400 years ago before the knock up stream. I think that jaya's right eye was emerald city's true location but with help of Uranus during the 800 year void it was taken up to marie geoise due to its significance. Also jaya was the arc in which emerald city was introduced so there maybe some connection.

\*\*EMERALD CITY AND THE OPE OPE NO MI\*\*

Doflamingo also stated that to access the national treasure the power of ope ope no mi is needed. The reason I think this is the case is when you enter the emerald city you get infected from sapphire scales  
(which I proved is related to jades and emeralds) The sapphire scales disease only spread when you are growing. That is if you are aging the sapphire scale will also spread. We know that ope ope no mi can do the ETERNAL YOUTH SURGERY which basically stops an individuals aging making it immortal. So if the person undergoes eternal youth surgery and access the emerald city they will get infected from sapphire scales but the disease wont spread as the person is not aging but the person still has to avoid sunlight.

Moreover in chineese culture jade also resembles ETERNAL YOUTH.

\*\*IMU AND THE EMERALD CITY\*\*

How is this related to IMU? well I guess now we are going into the fan fiction category to explain that.

During the 800 year void IMU received eternal youth surgery from the previous ope ope no mi fruit user(The hidden power of ope ope no mi can only be known if it was used before) Upon achieving the eternal youth IMU accessed emerald city got infected by sapphire scales but it didn't spread because of IMU's eternal youth. IMU with the help of Uranus and wealth of the emerald city took over the world. IMU's only weakness being sunlight she confined herself in a chamber.

Thats the reason IMU fears the sun and the sun god. IMU will be killed by THE NEW DAWN which will be brought by THE SUN GOD NIKA!

\*\*TLDR\*\*

Sapphire scales disease main cause is exposure to jade/emerald. The emerald city is the national treasure of the marie geoise as it contains wealth of jades and emeralds and power of Uranus which is enough to rule over the world. It was initially located in jaya but it was displaced from jaya to marie geoise because of its significance. The ope ope no mi is needed to access the emerald city because if you enter the city you will get infected by the sapphire scales but it will only spread if you are aging as eternal youth surgery of ope ope no mi stops your body's aging basically the disease wont spread. The only weakness will be the sunlight. IMU accessed the emerald city in a similar way in the 800 yr void which gave IMU the power to rule over the world. IMU's only weakness is the sun thats why she fears the sun god.

if this isnt making sense I would suggest you to read the theory.

So yeah this was the theory it went pretty long But I think its worth it.
