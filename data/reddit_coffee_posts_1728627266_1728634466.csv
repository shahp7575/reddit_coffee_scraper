1g14t7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g14t7x/how_attachment_can_blind_you/,How attachment can blind you,"Hey, I would like to share my story from last month. I think it might help some of you and I would love to hear your opinion at the end.



So I \[M\]23 met a girl F\[20\]. We met through our mutual friend at sports action. We went on a first date a few days later, we wrote in the time between our first meeting and the date. It was pleasant, we had a great time. Then we went on the 1st date, it was really nice, we went for coffee and the walk around our city, it lasted about 3 hours then she had to go home to get ready for work. She kept saying how she wanted me to meet her here again etc. and I had the same feeling. Some time forward, we met on a party, we were both in a kind of ""drunk"" state, so we were kind a more close that night, we were kissing and hugging all night and that was the time when something in me attached to her. We talked about it the next day and we said we didn't regret it, but we would rather go out on dates, which of course will escalate into something like this. Then we were able to see each other for almost 2 weeks, we just wrote and I found out some of her traits that I did not like. 



She often said she would be free at some point, but the day before she would just say: Sorry, I will not be available for the next X hours without explanation. Then I had some success at work, which I was really happy about, and she did not share the happiness with me, she did not even congratulate me or anything, I was kind of sad about it, but because of this ""attachment"" I kind of ignored it. I am always told that I am a good guy, that I care about the woman I am talking to. I ask her how her day was, if she is in trouble I will help her, show my support, come and pick her up at night if she does not feel safe to go home alone.



We went on the 4th date, again it was really nice, we talked all the time, we were on the date for about 6 hours. But 2 days later she almost stopped responding, only if she needed something... and I realise that I am being used. I am making her feel good all the time, I will make time when she wants even if it does not benefit me, telling her how pretty she is, caring about her and that makes her feel good, she knew that if she will do something I will probably forgive her because she had to notice that I am attached to her somehow so she can manipulate me. 



So I just cut her out of my life.

I am a person who does not get sad easily, the only thing that can make me feel bad is arguments and stuff about ""love"" between me and a person I am somehow attached to. It kills my productivity, my habbits, everything, and because my job is to be focused and creative, it was slowly killing my job.

This part is somehow SELFISH, but it is how I feel it right now.

I am glad that I met her because I know now that I will never put the woman first in my priorities, it will always be me. I want to show them that when I am with them, my life is easier, more pleasant, but if you do not want to respect my boundaries and my needs, I do not need you in my life.",1,1728634214.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a two-story small house is an exciting venture where you can blend function with innovative features. One of the joys of this type of architecture is that you can maximize space without compromising style. Let's explore some innovative features you might consider when planning your two-story small house design.

### Open Floor Plan

One of the best features of a small home is an open floor plan. By removing unnecessary walls, you create a sense of spaciousness. It allows natural light to flow throughout the area, making your home feel larger and more inviting. Imagine your living room seamlessly connecting to the dining area and kitchen, encouraging a communal atmosphere.

### Multi-Functional Spaces

When space is at a premium, having multi-functional areas can significantly enhance utility. Here are some ideas:

- **Convertible Furniture:** Opt for a sofa bed or a coffee table that transforms into a dining table.
- **Flexible Rooms:** Consider a guest room that can double as a home office or a playroom.
- **Built-In Storage:** Utilize built-in shelves or cabinets that can serve different purposes across rooms.

### Outdoor Integration

Bringing the outdoors in can elevate your small house design. Think about large windows or sliding glass doors that open up to a private patio or balcony. This addition can enhance the living space, making it feel airy and connected to nature. You might also consider integrating a small garden or rooftop terrace, providing you with a peaceful escape right at home.

### Smart Home Features

Technology has revolutionized home design, making it possible for you to live comfortably while saving energy. Incorporate smart home devices like:

- **Smart Thermostats:** Control your heating and cooling systems from your smartphone for maximum efficiency.
- **Automated Lighting:** Use motion sensors and programmable lighting to brighten your home only when needed.
- **Security Systems:** Home security cameras and alarms that can be monitored remotely will provide peace of mind.

### Creative Stair Solutions

Stairs are one of the most crucial components of a two-story small house. Instead of conventional designs, think outside the box. Here are some innovative stair solutions:

- **Spiral Staircases:** These are space-efficient and can serve as a statement piece in your home.
- **Floating Stairs:** They create a sleek aesthetic and allow for more natural light to filter through.
- **Staircase Storage:** Integrate drawers or shelves within the staircases to maximize storage without taking up extra room.

### Energy-Efficient Design

Being environmentally conscious is more important than ever. Consider building with energy-efficient materials and using energy-saving practices. Here are some features to include:

- **Insulated Windows:** High-quality, double-glazed windows can help regulate temperature.
- **Solar Panels:** Harness solar energy to reduce your electricity bills and environmental impact.
- **Green Roofing:** Add a living roof or a reflective roof that reduces heat buildup.

### Personalized Aesthetics

Your home should be a reflection of your personality. Integrate unique design elements that showcase your style. Consider:

- **Bold Paint Choices:** Don't shy away from vibrant colors that can make your small home feel lively.
- **Custom Artwork:** Display personal artwork or sculptures that can serve as conversation starters.
- **Themed Rooms:** Design each room with a specific theme or color palette that resonates with you.

With careful planning and creative thinking, a two-story small house can become a cozy, innovative, and beautiful space. Remember, functionality is just as important as style. By incorporating these features, you can design a home that not only fits your needs but also delights your senses.

Maximizing Space and Functionality in a Two Story Small House
-------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a small house with two stories can be an exciting challenge. With creative planning, you can maximize space and functionality without compromising comfort. The key is to think strategically about how you can use every inch effectively.

### Utilizing Vertical Space

One great advantage of a two-story small house is the vertical space it provides. Here are some strategies to make the most of your vertical areas:

- **High Ceilings:** Consider incorporating high ceilings in common areas like the living room or kitchen. This creates an open feeling that makes the room appear larger.
- **Loft Areas:** Create a loft over a portion of the living area for additional storage or a cozy reading nook. This clever use of space keeps your main floor uncluttered.
- **Wall Storage:** Use wall-mounted shelves for books, decorative items, or even plants. This keeps your floors clear and adds character to your home.

### Smart Layout Design

Your layout can greatly influence how functional your home feels. Think about these tips when planning:

- **Open Floor Plans:** An open layout for the kitchen, dining, and living areas fosters a sense of togetherness. It also makes moving around easier.
- **Multi-Functional Rooms:** Design rooms that serve multiple purposes. For example, a guest bedroom can also serve as a home office with the right furniture choices.
- **Corners and Nooks:** Don’t ignore corners. They can be utilized with corner shelves or cozy benches, increasing your usable space.

### Smart Furniture Choices

Furniture plays a huge role in how functional your two-story small house is. Selecting pieces that are both stylish and space-saving can transform your home:

- **Modular Furniture:** Look for modular furniture that can be rearranged or expanded based on your needs, such as a sectional sofa or a fold-out dining table.
- **Storage Ottomans:** Ottomans that double as storage can hide away blankets or toys while providing additional seating.
- **Wall Beds:** Murphy beds that fold up into the wall are perfect for maximizing space in smaller bedrooms or guest rooms.

### Emphasizing Natural Light

Natural light can make your smaller spaces feel much larger and more inviting. Here are some ways to bring in more sunlight:

- **Large Windows:** Use larger windows or sliding glass doors in your design. This will help connect your indoor and outdoor spaces.
- **Skylights:** Installing skylights in key areas like the bathroom or hallway can brighten otherwise dark spots in your home.
- **Light Colors:** Paint your walls in light hues to reflect more light. Light-colored furnishings also help open up your space visually.

### Innovative Outdoor Spaces

Don’t forget about the outdoor areas of your small two-story home. Exterior spaces can also serve as functional additions:

- **Rooftop Decks:** If possible, a rooftop deck can offer a private outdoor space for relaxation or entertaining without needing a large footprint.
- **Patios and Balconies:** Use balconies or patios to create an extension of your living space. Adding furniture can turn these areas into cozy retreats.
- **Gardens:** Vertical gardening on walls or fences can bring greenery to small areas, enhancing both aesthetics and air quality.

To wrap up, maximizing space and functionality in a two-story small house requires creativity and strategic planning. By considering vertical space usage, smart layouts, functional furniture, natural light, and outdoor areas, you can create a home that feels spacious, comfortable, and meets all your needs. With each thoughtful design decision, you can enhance both your lifestyle and the value of your home.

### Conclusion

Designing a two-story small house ultimately involves striking a balance between innovative features and maximizing space. By thoughtfully integrating aspects such as multi-functional furniture, open floor plans, and creative storage solutions, you can enhance the functionality of your living space. Consider elements like high ceilings or built-in shelving that not only save room but also add character and style to your home.

Innovative features, such as large windows that invite natural light or outdoor spaces like balconies and rooftops, can make a significant difference in how you experience your two-story small house. These decisions allow you to create an inviting atmosphere that feels spacious and comfortable without compromising on design.

Furthermore, the layout plays a crucial role in achieving an efficient use of space. Zoning different areas for specific activities—whether it’s a cozy reading nook in the living room or a workspace in the hallway—will ensure that you make the most out of every square foot. Prioritizing accessibility is also vital; consider cascading staircases that are safe and visually appealing.

The goal of a two-story small house design is to create a home that reflects your lifestyle and meets your needs. With smart planning and creativity, you can cultivate a space that feels expansive, innovative, and uniquely yours. Embrace the process of designing your small house, focusing on features and functionality that enhance your daily life, providing a perfect sanctuary for you and your family.",1,1728633688.0,House1000Designs,0,1.0,False

So that day I woke up feeling a bit (!!) already, the plan was going to work and meet up with the guy around 5pm for a coffee, then at 8pm I had a concert to go and that was it. Well, as soon as I got to the office I decided that I hated my clothes, I wanted new ones 'cause why not? Something was botherIng me and the thoughts of ""you only live once"" led me to head to the mall at lunchtime to buy new pants, new t-shirt and new jacket, so spent around EUR400 out of the fckng blue, but I had to look great for my coffee date. 

So headed to my date, already being very aware that I was going a bit hypo and forced myself into being the most chill person ever...The first 30 minutes were great and we decided to go to a bar, I told myself I wasn't drInking and then again out of nowhere I thought it was an amazing idea to have a beer, who turned into 4 and me deciding that nope, I didn't want to go to the concert, I wanted to drInk more and hang out more with the guy who was apparently having an amazing time. I didn't get drunk, but whenever I'm hypomanic I feel very high and next day I can't barely remember what happened...We were walking, I was singing Adele in a microphone wIth a guy in the middle of the street at some point (?) and well, the date officially ended 3am. 

A few days go by and the guy reached out, he said he had an amazing time, however he felt like I was pretty high at some point, that I got a bit too ""energetic"" and now he's not so sure who's the real me. I won't tell him about my bipolar right now, but he wants to give it another shot...It's kinda frustrating that sometImes I have to force myself into behave normally, I have to always be aware of my actions just to make sure the illness won't show...Oh well, the week after I had a super super low, obviously...And that's why I kinda feel more comfortable when I'm depressed, at least people won't complain about how energetic I am.",4,1728633084.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

I'm just looking for someone to chat with online for now, and I thought this would be an interesting topic to start with! We can talk for a while and see where things go haha. I'm curious to hear thoughts from different people on this topic. 

About me: 
- 28 years old
- 6 ft tall
- halfie 🇺🇸 🇵🇭 
- average-to-fit body type (SFW/wholesome pics on my profile!)
- big fan of good coffee shops, fantasy books, live music, and silly questions like this

Anyway! I know that consensus is that performance generally matters more than size. But when people do talk about size, it seems like they're usually asking about length. Despite that, I have also heard people say that the girth is important, too!  

So I'm just wondering if there is any agreement on this. In your opinion, which is more important in bed? Is length better than girth, or does girth matter more than length? And why?  

I think it would be interesting to learn what different people think about this! So if you want to share your opinion, feel free to message on here :)

\
Il porting è stato sviluppato dal developer developer PatnosDD, lo stesso autore di altri porting di successo come Coffee Talk e Hollow Knight.\
Cuphead è uno dei giochi visivamente più sorprendenti mai realizzati in Unity. Tutti gli artwork animati del gioco sono stati disegnati a mano, inchiostrati su carta e poi colorati in Photoshop.\
Il gioco è stato realizzato utilizzando gli stessi strumenti e le stesse tecniche di animazione degli anni '30.\
Questo nuovo aggiornamento ha corretto diversi problemi, tra cui: elementi di sfondo mancanti nel livello Funhouse Frazzle, piattaforme disallineate e immagini mancanti nel livello Treetop Trouble, cornici vuote nell'animazione del coleottero volante e una linea nera visibile nei livelli di Captain Brineybeard e Djimmi The Great.\
Corretta anche la texture della lama circolare nel livello di Djimmi The Great, e il cielo di sfondo mancante in Funfair Fever.\
L'animazione del logo MDHR è stata rallentata alla velocità prevista, e la posizione dei file di salvataggio è stata spostata da ux0:data a ux0:data/Cuphead (i file vengono trasferiti automaticamente).\
Sono stati inoltre corretti gli indicatori di morte dei boss disallineati e i cursori del volume audio all'interno delle impostazioni.\
SE SI POSSIEDE UN DLC, RISCARICARE IL GIOCO SENZA DLC. L'OVERCLOCK È NECESSARIO PER FAR FUNZIONARE IL GIOCO COME PREVISTO (MAX CPU OC, MAX BUS OC).\
Si consiglia di non provare a avviare il gioco senza aver prima caricato tutti i file necessari in quanto potrebbe bloccarsi.\
\
Versione Steam\
\
 	Scaricare il file Cuphead.vpk da VitaDB ed installarlo sulla console.\
 	Scaricare l'archivio CupheadVitaSTEAM.zip ed estrarlo su PC.\
 	Copiare la cartella del gioco (..\steamapps\common\Cuphead) all'interno della cartella estratta (dovrebbe essere la versione Steam).\
 	Avviare lo script ApplyPatch.bat e attendere (ci vorranno da 15 a 25 minuti a seconda del sistema).\
 	Lasciare che finisca e dovrebbe esserci un file .ZIP chiamato CupheadVITA_FILES.zip.\
 	Aprire VitaShell, collegare la console PlayStation Vita al PC e copiare il contenuto dell'archivio .ZIP (non il file ZIP stesso, solo i file al suo interno) in ux0:app/CPHD23233/.\
 	Avviare il gioco e divertirsi!\
\
Versione GOG\
\
 	Scaricare il file Cuphead.vpk da VitaDB ed installarlo sulla console.\
 	Scaricare l'archivio CupheadVitaGOG.zip ed estrarlo su PC.\
 	Copiare la cartella del gioco (..\Cuphead\Cuphead_Data) all'interno della cartella estratta (dovrebbe essere la versione GOG).\
 	Avviare lo script ApplyPatch.bat e attendere (ci vorranno da 15 a 25 minuti a seconda del sistema).\
 	Lasciare che finisca e dovrebbe esserci un file .ZIP chiamato CupheadVITA_FILES.zip.\
 	Aprire VitaShell, collegare la console PlayStation Vita al PC e copiare il contenuto dell'archivio .ZIP (non il file ZIP stesso, solo i file al suo interno) in ux0:app/CPHD23233/.\
 	Avviare il gioco e divertirsi!\
\
Problemi noti\
\
 	Alcune texture saranno a bassa risoluzione per evitare problemi legati alla Ram.\
 	Possibili problemi audio (clip che suonano ad un volume non corretto, o glitch).\
 	Alcune animazioni potrebbero avere fotogrammi mancanti in alcune scene o essere visualizzate in modo errato.\
 	Alcuni livelli hanno un basso framerate (livelli platform, livello Ape, livello Genio).\
 	I livelli aerei potrebbero avere animazioni cuphead visualizzate in modo errato (stato rimpicciolito, ad esempio).\
\
Changelog\
\
 	Corretti gli elementi di sfondo mancanti nel livello platforming Funhouse Frazzle.\
 	Corretta la piattaforma disallineata alla fine del livello Treetop Trouble.\
 	Corretta immagine mancante di un elemento di platforming nel livello Treetop Trouble.\
 	Corretta l'erba disallineata alla fine del livello Treetop Trouble.\
 	Corretto il frame vuoto nell'animazione del coleottero volante nel livello Treetop Trouble.\

It was received generally well, so in the run up to CitizenCon 2024 This will include Every ship announcement, feature announcement, with links to promises kept/broken (Even the sand worm). I noticed people said it was biased one way or another, so I will try to keep both the optimists/pessimists happy this time and provide timestamps to each feature mentioned.

**2016** - 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuDj5v81Nd0&ab_channel=StarCitizen
**Major Features/announcements**

* Procedural Planets v2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCFTF8j7yI&ab_channel=StarCitizen - Implemented, to an extend. Promises were kept and broken. Initial presentation promised 60 FPS and what was shown was in game. However, the base building/procedural generation is present in current game, just not finished. However, Sandworm, the mission, and the entire presentation was ""faked"" and no mission is as in depth currently. 
* Spectrum - Implemented full feature - Announcement of spectrum and organizations forming. Not much to delve deeper here - https://youtu.be/XuDj5v81Nd0?si=LfgBV4N7qP8bVtg0&t=2119 - Segment about 20minutes . One not implemented promise is spectrum in game, in game overlay, and additional customization for orgs (ingame)
* 2.6 - Star Marine addition, AC update, Crusader map, lobby -All completed

**SQ 42**  - Going to be its own segment as I was informed a good portion of you give 0 fucks about it, so you can skip these portions. - https://youtu.be/XuDj5v81Nd0?si=U03AK_b92va58RY0&t=3424

* 2016-2017 Release date promised, along with spiel about what is going to be in it. We don't know what is finished from the list, but of the list that is intriguing is
* 40 distinct ships, 1255 pages of dialogue, AI with 24hr schedules
* Every mission has several ways to complete it, that will affect how characters interact with you in SC.
* They announce they will develop pathfinding logic - still in progress as of last SQ42 monthly update, animation integration - still in progress based on last SQ42 update, Improved combat logic- in progress, Mission system integration - Done as of 2021, Enhanced Flight AI - Improved significantly based on reports, still worked on
* OCS -Implemented

**Major Features/announcements**

* Items will be persistent, can store them in ship, house, hangar - https://www.youtube.com/live/OxjZUKL8ByQ?si=YvgYiZ2Fy6-sMGKj&t=1617 - I say half implemented, mainly due to house/hangar not being in game.
* Closet interaction/Apartment - https://www.youtube.com/live/OxjZUKL8ByQ?si=WKkohMbT4ouOxFvr&t=2034 - As far as I remember, I don't recall closets being a thing, but I honestly never opened one.

* Economic Model - Not Implemented - Really hyped it up. - https://youtu.be/_8VFw1F-olQ?si=jcqTSofec5KPI4_h&t=670 almost hour segment. None of it done in game. Build factories, shops, stores, etc. Promises the most complex game economy ever created and will ever be created. ""It will be more complex than real life"" and impossible to exploit. - Reason being, it will break the current game until server meshing and other features are done.
* Ship Shutter system - not in game
* Theatres of War - Will be released in ""weeks"" - Not implemented due to tech implementations and lag. - https://youtu.be/Xr3PATgOEmo?si=rY4bdoZqLcHyZdid&t=927 . Their worst prediction, ever. Unique in the fact that several devs and CR parroted the fact it was done. 
* Ship purchases -Implemented

* OCS/QoL - Implemented
* Server Meshing update, working on server side, almost done - https://youtu.be/-tB3cark5lA?si=j4eufpirxcIpel5E&t=698

* Outposts on microtech where you need an ID card to access, Mission briefing, etc -  https://youtu.be/-tB3cark5lA?si=XedRAxIYCmN8NaUl&t=982 - Very cool segment - Might be faked as not in game yet.
* Cutter tech, can cut vents, doors, etc - https://youtu.be/-tB3cark5lA?si=F4zQrP2wemzRWeTM&t=1363 -100% fake, as they are still working on it.
* Stealth Gameplay + Missions, able to silent takedowns, change uniforms Hitman 47 like - https://youtu.be/-tB3cark5lA?si=bdP8iHBeQAdhLzqY&t=1755 - 100% faked, as we now know.
* Environmental Suits - https://youtu.be/-tB3cark5lA?si=aSk1CmrN1a0ZeemM&t=1992 - Visor frost up implemented, but all suits are the same currently, mentioned how environment matters suit to suit.
* Tarp pulling/Cloth physics - https://youtu.be/-tB3cark5lA?si=KHbdMDi8Jltbz5mh&t=2179 -100% faked, as we now know. Covering up vehicles protect them from environment - not a thing currently.
* Jump Points to Pyro - https://youtu.be/-tB3cark5lA?si=o7wtIc6pog0s1uZq&t=3298 - Now in PTU, but it shows it working here. So obviously faked.
* New Babbage - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sehdYoXORzw&list=PLVct2QDhDrB0atMb1EAyYgggX5DyfUzd4&index=10&ab_channel=StarCitizen - Implemented, but not all promises. Mostly corporate ID, Trash AI (yes, picking up trash AI)

**2021** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmf3pcC7qZ0&list=PLVct2QDhDrB2KG9U_7u7owS_zdagfcJEm&ab_channel=StarCitizen - Playlist, shortest citizencon since 2016. It returns with much hype and fanfare, biggest fundraising year ever, devs hyped about how much money they are getting. Largest new citizen sign ups, It was the most hype period of SC history. I cannot stress how much money they made and how much hype this year was.

**Major Features/announcements**

* PYRO - https://youtu.be/kZWT4aNY6lU?si=idSeFlvf0G4eibCz&t=139 - Much hype, relevant for now, talks about clinics, drugs, crime, etc. - Pyro Sizzle reel -  https://youtu.be/kZWT4aNY6lU?si=kQ20dODwF-Uy59ja&t=2173
* Pyro will be out EoY  or early 2022 at the latest - (sort of implemented and people have played it).
* Vulkan showcase - Still in progress
* Gen 12 Rendering - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQkN1YdT6SI&list=PLVct2QDhDrB2KG9U_7u7owS_zdagfcJEm&index=5&ab_channel=StarCitizen - Still being worked on, noticeable news is an artic rabbit on Microtech and water/rivers. 
* Dynamic weather - Implemented.
* Server Meshing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSzUWl4r2rU&list=PLVct2QDhDrB2KG9U_7u7owS_zdagfcJEm&index=6&ab_channel=StarCitizen - Hard to do they found out, but they are making good progress, any day now. Mentions replication layer - 3.21 now and humorously, their database vendor - Remember the news on the shitshow last month, kinda funny in hindsight.
* Hiring NPCs - https://youtu.be/LxXy8HF1t70?si=BexIe2xy7hwzPNDB&t=1498 - They never said a date, so not too harsh on them here.
* Dynamic events- Nine Tails hunt you, npc pirates, etc. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxXy8HF1t70&list=PLVct2QDhDrB2KG9U_7u7owS_zdagfcJEm&index=8&ab_channel=StarCitizen - If you sell too much in one place, it would drive npc traders away, and how AI reacts to players. You can force all AI to sit in a zone, etc. -Not implemented, though they said it was gonna be in game soon, during that time frame I realized there was NO WAY they'd implemented this fast. This is like next gen tech. I'm sorry I'm putting my opinion here, but I feel the devs are TOO optimistic, like holy shit, all of this tech is cool as fuck, but this time table for this AI system is too optimistic. This feels like its 10x more complex than server meshing.

**2023 Citcon**

**Half the features they promised will be done by 2024 citcon during the Citcon, now let's see which one was kept.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/17e7yu7/entire_citizen_con_2953_text_summary_of_both_days/

**Main Features Points**


* New Hairstyles EoY 2023 - Fulfilled

* Server Meshing Live Demo - Currently being fulfilled 2k test recently

* Engineering component to be in AC experimental mode - Not fulfilled

* Outposts showcase

**Water** - React to players, bullets, ship, wind
 . Reworked Water Rendering recently to forward shading, this explains why it got restarted on the roadmap - (4+ years in dev, with at least them restarting from scratch once) https://imgur.com/a/kBMhr4o - Never promised to be done within a year unlike other features.

**Fire** - Unfulfilled, as they stated it will be implemented ""soon"". 

* Misfires - Misfires will be added, where your ship will catch on fire, burst of energy making you easily detectable. turning it on/off is a valid engineering gameplay loop.

* Some fires are so big, you can't put it out alone with an extinguisher, need multiple players, or more drastic measures such as cutting oxygen, vent, etc. (or imo, just remove that part of the ship, see ya nerds)

* Fire Extinguisher Gameplay - 
 Extinguish fire with Fire extinguisher, oxygen venting (showcased in ISC 2022 and Citcon 2022), fuel depletion. - https://imgur.com/a/wFj15ns - Not fulfilled with the fire.

**Fauna and Flora** - Limited fulfillment. 

**Physics**

* Maelstrom (Battlefield like) destruction - Not fulfilled/done. Was meant to be shortly after server meshing.  Ships collide spin out of control, environment will be broken by players etc. with Physicalized damage.

**Pyro** - Fulfilled, but not really fully linked to Stanton yet.

**BLOOD, SWEAT, and TEARS + Hygiene** - Half fulfilled, blood and sweat is seen with new models, but no hygiene mechanic in the game yet. 

* https://imgur.com/a/wzLs0Oy

**Upscaling/Raytracing** - Wholly unfulfilled 

* CIG TSR, FSR2, DLSS2 - FSR2, DLSS2 is cool. 
* DLSS3 will come a lot later.
* Raytracing for high end machines, CIG tracing for low end machines. -  https://imgur.com/a/N7s0MDm
* Light will finally come from, well light and panels. Meaning your panels will better light up your ship
* Better blacks for HDR



**Star Engine**
* New Cloud tech and scenery updates.  - Volumetric shadows - https://imgur.com/a/8aA237z - Half implemented, new skybox and the works, to mixed reviews. 

**Realistic Audio** - Implemented, but need special devices, and lengthy opt in.

**Star Cloth** - Not implemented. 

**Frontier Fashion** - Not implemented.

**Star Hair** - Implemented partially - Not all of the hairstyles promised are out and color mixing.

**Evolving UI**

* Map - https://imgur.com/a/eOOX3fJ - Of stations, etc ,\
* Can download or acquire via radar scanning. route tracking available - Not implemented as its not dynamic. 
Demonstration of it, how it solves many of the current issues.

* Current UI too cluttered - https://imgur.com/a/4rLW6dO - updated

* MobiiGlass Rework - https://imgur.com/a/e46zWLy - Not implemented 
* Ship Hud - https://imgur.com/a/XQ7QJEu - Not implemented. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Closing thoughts/fun stats**

* Less than half of the features shown in citcon 2023 are in game due to the lengthy 3.23 cycle taking 3x longer than expected as we all know. 2023 is on track with 2016 as the least fulfilled citcon in terms of promises.

I made my model in Tinkercad, but i've run into a few issues.  
It seems my measurements from irl don't correctly translate to Tinkercad which also led to wrong aspects, i've tried adjusting it and the measurements on the model almost add up the the original.  
When i print it though, because it is kind of thin the print doens't properly get printed.  
I'm printing with PETG (just as reference to perfect the model) (im still looking for a foodsafe filament that can withstand up to 100 degrees without getting deformed.

I hope someone can provide me with their guidance and advice :)

Here’s what I wish I had known before I started.","I opened my first coffee shop at 20 with the help of my family, and over the last four years, I’ve expanded to three locations. From the outside, it might look like success, but the truth is I’m severely burnt out and constantly second-guessing myself. I’m sharing this because I know a lot of people glamorize entrepreneurship, but here’s the reality no one told me about:

1. The personal cost is higher than you think. I’ve sacrificed a lot of my social life, and at times it feels like I’m wasting my youth.
2. Leadership is hard when you’re still figuring yourself out. As someone what struggles with anxiety and confrontation, managing staff has been one of my biggest challenges.
3. It’s lonely. Even when things are going well on paper, it’s hard not to feel like I’m in it alone, especially as one of the few Black business owners in a small town.
4. You’re never “done.” Every time I hit a milestone, like opening a new location, the relief is temporary. There’s always something else—staffing, inventory, customer service—that needs my attention.

I’m learning that success isn’t about non-stop growth; it’s about finding balance, and that’s something I’m still working on. Anyone else out there struggling with feeling like they’re on a hamster wheel? What’s helped you find balance? Or is that just part of the deal?",7,1728631155.0,smallbusiness,7,0.77,False
1g143ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ceramics/comments/1g143ux/pin_holes_when_glazing_dark_clay/,Pin holes when glazing dark clay ??,"I suppose I have a few questions. 

First, I am plagued by pinholes - Moreso when using dark clays but not solely. The owner of my community studio keeps advising better wiping of my pieces before glazing, but I fully wash them and then let them dry and sometimes damp sponge again if they've sat too long. Can this really be the culprit?

I've been reading a few things about kiln schedules and loading that apparently may cause pinholes, too, but I have zero knowledge or control in relation to firing (community studio. They do it all). I'm not sure how to respectfully approach questioning them, or even whether I should,  when they have way more knowledge than I do. Any advice? 

Finally, I've also encountered some stuff about darker clays being more prone to these issues, and I definitely do have MORE problems using Plainsman Coffee...which is infuriating because the unglazed parts of my pieces are gorgeous! Any suggested glazes to lean towards with this clay? 

Any advice at all???

I’m a **31-year-old male** dealing with a combination of health issues that have persisted for most of my life, and I’d greatly appreciate any thoughts or insights. Sorry it's gotten so long! I’ve included as much relevant information as possible:

* **Lifelong** **chronic diarrhea** (started around age 12) at least once and sometimes up to 10 times a day. This recently improved after eliminating all processed food and incorporating some supplements, and it's coincided with an improvement in anxiety and a \*slight\* improvement in energy levels and mood; but it hasn't completely resolved.
* **Coordination issues** since childhood (e.g. difficulty repeating simple movements like dancing or doing exercises like push ups). I saw an occupational therapist at age 5 who diagnosed me as ""uncoordinated"", but no specific explanation was provided.
* **Exercise intolerance** and an aversion to physical activity have been constant problems. I used to think I just couldn't handle discomfort but now I think there's an issue there.
* **Sleep issues**: I struggle to fall asleep before 3 AM most nights and no amount of mindfulness or sleep hygiene can fix this. As such, I'm constantly exhausted during the day.
* **Chronic vomiting** triggered by stress or even mild physical reactions like hard coughing, gagging when brushing my teeth, strenuous physical activity, or consuming black coffee or tea on an empty stomach. But sometimes it's seemingly random. Note this has also significantly improved with the new diet, but it's still happening.
* **Brain fog** and a general feeling of being spaced out remains a \*serious\* lifelong issue. I'm a lawyer, and my verbal/written comprehension is just awful. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and haven't seen much of an improvement despite taking medications.
* **Chronic anxiety** and **depression** since childhood: I’ve always felt like I’m in constant fight-or-flight mode, and I've always been very melancholic and low mood / low energy.
* **Swollen lymph nodes** (especially in my neck) that have come and gone since childhood. I've had them checked several times - they're always benign and doctors have suggested stress might play a role.

**Potential Hormonal Issues:**

* I still get **acne** as an adult.
* I have extremely **wide hips** for a man and a female pattern of fat distribution including mild-moderate **man titties**, **stretch marks** **since childhood** (following my first big weight gain at 8 years old) and **very skinny arms/wrists**, despite significant **weight fluctuations**. My weight has ranged from 65kg to 110kg since I was a teenager, and I’ve had periods where I would lose 30-40kg through calorie restriction and fasting. However, in the last 3 years, despite doing my utmost to shed body fat, I’ve been unable to lose any fat–almost as if my metabolism is broken.
* **Low muscle tone** with a very unattractive ""skinny fat"" look throughout my life, though I’ve never done any muscle-building workouts (or any exercise at all really, aside from walking).

**Other Symptoms:**

* **Reactive lymphocytes** and **mild neutropenia** in every second or third blood test I've had over the last 10 years. Doctors never seem concerned about it because it goes away on the repeat blood test, only to return later.
* White, coated tongue and very dry mouth.

**Tests:**

* I had my testosterone levels checked a year ago and my doctor said they were on the high end of the normal range for a man of my age, but my **sex drive has significantly dropped** since then and I've been experiencing increasing problems with **erections**.
* I have **normal-sized penis and testes**, with **excessive body hair** (chest and back) compared to other males in my family.
* I’ve been tested for **celiac disease** and **Crohn’s / IBD**, and both tests came back **negative**.
* Thyroid has been tested several times (TSH blood test) and is normal.

**Medications/Supplements/Treatments:**

* I’ve tried \*five\* different **antidepressants** over the years–none of them have made the slightest difference.
* I’ve been on **Vyvanse** for ADHD, which does help with mood / attention / motivation, but doesn’t last long (maybe 3 hours - I appear to be a rapid metaboliser) and a general foggy feeling is still always present.
* I've been taking multivitamins, zinc, B-complex, vit D, fish oil and a probiotic for 6 weeks.
* I've been in therapy for a year - has made little difference, if any.

We are a family of 3 \[two introverts\] and recently bought a house, spacious enough for us to enjoy ourselves.

However, we’re under constant pressure from our families to have them over. We keep low contact, but let’s say they miss our son—why is it the norm to stay in our house? If I miss someone, I’d rent an Airbnb and ask if they want to meet. It seems like, because they live in a different country, stays of more than 7 days are considered appropriate. I don’t feel comfortable even for 2 days. At all.

I’ve heard people say it’s just people-pleasing, that I’m afraid to show my real self. And yes, I can be grumpy, tired, or simply not in the mood to communicate. I don’t understand why I have to conform to this norm.

With my husband’s family, it was more or less okay; they cooked a lot and were fairly independent, going out alone or with our son. But now it’s been 7/9 days since my dad arrived, and I’m counting the hours.

I’ve always disliked when my mom visited, but I thought it was because she’s toxic and doesn’t respect boundaries. Obviously, we don't do that anymore. My dad’s different—he’s a good person—but every day involves a three-course meal, coffee, and conversation. I just don’t think I’ll do this again.

I like my dad and my husband’s family, and I’m happy to meet a few times/once:) a year on neutral ground. But I dislike the expectation that I should invite someone to stay in my home. For me, it’s nonsense to ask: ""Oh, can I stay at your place?""

""She knows it"" (points to the barista at bar, as he walks over and waits at cafe handoff & then trying to flirt with said barista by talking about ""new people amirite? Lulz"")

(Barista on bar tells me it's a coffee with a bunch of modifiers- tall in an venti cup... add hot water, sweetener, cream, stir it, leave room, etc.)

As the person at register I ring it up while Joe waits at the handoff. I then make it the way the barista told me. Place the cup on the counter next to the register.

""Here's your Joe special, Joe"" being as nice and polite as I can be.

""Oh they usually bring it over here for me.""

""Oh, that's weird Joe. In my years as a supervisor, I've always had the register person make the brewed coffee and hand it to our customers right away so you don't have to wait too long for it."" (Being as nice and polite as possible)

(Joe walks over and takes the coffee from the register counter) ""oh thanks""

""My pleasure! Have a good one Joe!""

Now every time Joe walks in, I make his coffee right away. Of course I have the Joe Special memorized now. Of course I serve it to him before he leaves the register so (that he has no excuse to go to the cafe handoff and hit on young ladies who think he's gross but feel pressured to be nice to him) that he gets his coffee hot, fresh, and with no waiting.

Of course I make causal conversation about classes, sports, homework, etc. with my barista so he can overhear that the person he was previously trying to hit on is still in high school.

Of course he called a young lady barista ""darling"" (""Thanks darling, you're the best! You always take care of me!"")

Of course he got weirded out when I interrupted and said ""That's a big part of the job and we all try to do it well."" 

Of course he got weirded-out when I then called him ""darling"" (have a good one, darling!"" Right after he called a barista that.

Here's my philosophical / practical take: it would serve us well to become aware about this concept. We may think we're trying to learn something, but often it's more about feeling good about ourselves. Let's call that ontological and epistemological curiosity, and unpack what that means.

Ontology is about how the world works. Epistemology is about what it means to know something, how do we get to know something, and what are the limits of knowledge. One possible simplification could be that there are facts, and there are stories we wrap the facts in: explanations, interpretations, conclusions, opinions, and beliefs. One is not possible without the other. The acquisition of knowledge happens in two steps. We learn, or cognize, the facts; then we interpret, or re-cognize them. The primary knowledge may or may not enter the memory on its own, but it turns practical only through connection to prior knowledge.

If thinking is the sixth sense, the mental sensations, we can construct some analogies to other senses. For example, the difference between ontological seeing and epistemological seeing is the layer of interpretation. We don't see trees and people - we see shapes and colors. But within a blink of an eye, we know what we see. Again, the two aspects travel together: in order to understand what is the color blue, you have to have seen something that is or is not blue, and weave some story about what ""blue"" means.

The desire for some and aversion to other sensual and mental experiences are vital. In order to survive, our ancestors had to regularly satisfy the need for food, socially and reproductively suitable contact with other humans, and knowledge. Curiosity is as ancient as movement, and has been driven by the same neurotransmitters for hundreds of millions of years. Ontological sensing, the acquisition of experiences, is something we need to live. The stories we wrap those experiences are necessary and helpful to guide us towards ways to satisfy the need.

Epistemological sensing often takes emotional coloration. We see, taste, feel something we like, call it ""good"", want more of it, and less of its opposite. Adding another layer of interpretation, we justify and moralize seeking and getting it, as in ""I deserve a good dinner and a glass of wine"", or ""I'm not a human until my morning cup of coffee"". Primary sensual inputs and stories built around them can register as good or bad. We cognize - see a person or read about them, learn that they've done this and that - then recognize and categorize - then emotions roll in. The valence of the experience can lead us to be drawn to them or disgusted by them. Faster than you can say ""epistemology"", we will know if they've done something good or bad, if they ARE good or bad, and even whether other people like them are good or bad.

The emotional layering is rarely neutral. Indifference is aversion to knowledge, a lack of thirst. Complacency, in particular to something that we recognize as awful, tragic, and unjust, is aversion to the discomfort we would feel if we think about it or attempt to change it. Whichever way you lean, you'll seek more good and less bad, and it may or may not matter that the primary inputs contradict your interpretation. We'll wish things were different. We'll seek freedom from personal discomfort. Having found it, we'll find more things to want, become afraid to lose them, and in doing so remain trapped. We can't be free of something, we can only be free WITH something. The previous sentence can be packed into one word: acceptance. As we say, ""you live WITH it"".

Acceptance can seem hard or impractical, but we've all done it before, to our profound benefit. At least once in your life, you must have wished you could fly. You ontologically cognize, very early in life, very directly and often painfully, that there is something you'll eventually recognize as gravity, but today you just recognize that you strongly dislike how it feels. Wouldn't it be nice to not feel that?

It doesn't take long to learn to accept that this is a fact of life. It's also readily recognized that imaginary or technologically enabled freedom from gravity brings along a new set of experiences to dislike. Deep in memory, we have numerous primary facts about what gravity feels like, yet we hardly ever feel bad about it. Moreover, acceptance unlocks curiosity for deeper ontological exploration, the acquisition of raw facts and experiences leading to very different stories - about how to effectively live WITH gravity and work around it. Acceptance is the only path to freedom - not from gravity, but from pain and fear of gravity. It's the indifference and complacency that are utterly impractical: you'd never know how to walk, let alone build airplanes, if you didn't care to learn what gravity feels like.

Acceptance requires recognized mental and sensory knowledge that is unencumbered by emotional overinterpretation of raw sensory inputs and facts. Deeply entrenched, long-term patterns can be broken if and only if you get ontologically curious about why things are the way they are and how it feels. The epistemological curiosity about whose fault it is and how things should be is a defense strategy that is easily turned into an instrument of attack, leading to more ignorance and misery. It helps to feel good about yourself, but holds you back from taking that first step. You might fall a hundred times, but you may eventually fly.

You ever feel the frustration of banging away at your workouts when you’re not seeing as much progress as you expect?

I’ve felt that way in the past…

Sometimes, I’ve actually wondered if all this training was worth it…

Maybe you can relate…

One of THE MOST productive seasons of my training life was back in September 2010 through April 2012, when I focused on getting healthy.

One of the major issues I identified was that my abs - ALL of them - were incredibly weak.

Pathetically so. Like a kitten.

Yesterday I told you about losing my body’s natural ability to stabilize itself.

So, I went on a “quest” to get it back.

Before I tell you what I did, let me tell you, it was murder on my mind.

After all, at that time, I was a Master Kettlebell Instructor with the RKC, and I’d just had my first kettlebell book published.

It was “hardcore.”

And at that time, I was not.

I felt like a hypocrite - an imposter even.

Sure, in the past I could train the way I was advocating…

But not at that moment.

To make matters worse, I’d spent over $20,000 on treatments and advanced “education” (overhyped certifications) over the previous 4 years with nothing positive to show for it.

I was getting tired and feeling worn out.

Sure, I was doing some restoration work, but every time I’d ramp up my heavy training, I’d tweak my lower back and get that awesome radiating pain across my belt line in my lower back and down my left leg.

So, I threw in the towel.

Not many people know this, but I actually gave up kettlebell lifting altogether for a full 18+ months.

Imagine that - a Master Kettlebell Instructor in the world’s leading kettlebell education company, not using kettlebells…

Talk about an identity crisis…

I was quickly becoming known as the “Double Kettlebell Guy”...

I viewed myself as The Guy who picked up heavy stuff and put it down again. (I’d even been the first person in the kettlebell community to Clean + Press a pair of Beasts - 2x48kg.)

But all that was over - in that moment - for that season.

I’d chosen to adopt a “new identity”...

I was about to become a father for the first time and I didn’t want to be the “busted up old dad who looked like a grandpa” - sitting on the sidelines - whose son was embarrassed by him.

Washed up.

Unable to play ball or wrestle with my son because I was a broken-down, beaten-up, has-been athlete who destroyed himself chasing dreams of glory…

I decided I was going to get healthy and strong - even if I had to redefine my view and definition of strength.

So, “all” I did was a bunch of reflexive core stability work and I hammered my core - especially my anterior chain - the front of my body - with good ol’ fashioned strength work.

For 18 months.

But not just any strength work.

Most of it was either floor or supported / hanging work, based on gymnastics strength work.

The result?

After not seeing my friend and Father of the Modern Kettlebell Renaissance, Pavel Tsatsouline, for nearly a year, we met for coffee in Budapest the night before the RKC Kettlebell Instructor Certification in August 2011.  
He was shocked by my appearance.

“Geoff… What have you been doing in your training? You look so… Athletic!”

I’d also lost about 15 pounds of fat in the process.

Right around that time, on a whim, I'd also tested my kettlebell strength.

I was able to perform 4 sets of 10 Double Cleans with a pair of 40kgs, with 2 minutes of rest. It was easy. What was interesting to note was that I’d struggled with ONE set of 10 when I was a full 20 pounds heavier - 225lbs.

So, I was lighter, leaner, stronger, and more explosive.

From NOT training with KBs, but focusing on rebuilding my core strength through reflexive core stability work and good ol’ fashioned hard core gymnastics-inspired anterior chain abdominal work.

Who’d a thunk it?

(I also got my first ever bodyweight Pistol - rock bottom single leg squat during this period. Even though I could Pistol a 48kg KB, I didn’t have the core stability to do bodyweight only Pistols.)

Systematic Core Training For Kettlebells

Inside, I will show you how to properly train your core using The SSP Model.

If you’ve never heard of The SSP Model, don’t worry, you’re not alone.

# Here’s how it works:

**1- Stability**

We retrain your body’s innate stabilization mechanism through reflexive core stability training. This type of training makes you practically injury proof, especially after you layer on…

**2- Strength**

We then build general strength on top of that in your body’s 3 major chains and 4 primary fascial sling systems, all of which help you move in all 3 planes of motion, almost like you did when you were a kid.

**3- Power**

Then we build up your power - we train your core to perform lots of work - especially resisting movement while moving. Yeah, sounds kinda like some kind of Zen Koan…",1,1728629886.0,Kettlebells4Workouts,0,1.0,False

For some context I met my boyfriend 27m five to six years ago and have been dating for four and a half years.  It took me one month of dating him to break up with him because I didn't like his mother.  He BEGGED me to reconsider and said that he hated his mom and only kept in contact because he had to for his dads sake.  

Let me just preface by saying there are for sure reasons that I don't love this woman (I dont hate her by any means.) After only dating my man for a few weeks MIL started sending long paragraphs about how ""if we were gonna make this work we needed to set some rules because this wasn't working for her.  Her son used to call her daily and now that we started dating he  barely calls her.  I better learn to find a way for her son to schedule her in or there were gonna be problems.""  I told her that it wasn't my job to dictate what he does with his day and if she missed her son then she needed to take that up with him.

At the time he still lived with his mom because he had a job over the road and he was paying his parents bills.  (His parents don't work.  Dad got laid off due to medical issues right before covid and mom hasn't held a solid job in 18 years apparently.)  Well it was tradition that I would drive to his house and wait for him to get home (usually only showing up there about ten minutes before him at most, sometimes I would get there right as he did.) His mom would come tap on my car window and demand that I come inside and hang out with her.  I smoke weed as we all three have our med card and this woman dead ass came outside to demand I smoke with her only to smash up a pill and snort it right in front of me and say she needed that so bad.  Like WTF.  

I noticed very early on that his mom likes to recruit his friends and make them hers and act like the cool mom but really she just seemed like a fucked up pill head.  Her behavior would change SO erratically back then.  She has an issue with her eyes and she convinced me she was going blind and had me wait on her hand and foot.  She would walk upstairs and then ask me to go downstairs to get her soda.  Once she said she wanted a coffee and literally ran into the coffee bar all dramatically and told me she was blind so I had to make it.  I called her out on her behavior and MIRACULOUSLY she got prescribed medicine that restored her vision in two days.  

She would send me videos of her recording herself while absolutely zooted, telling me how perfect I am for her son and thanks for coming into his life.  I mean she was so messed up on pills that her eyes were barely open for these videos.  

About two weeks after the ""blind"" incident she was driving her three year old nephew at the time in the middle of a snowstorm and everyone TOLD her not to drive because she was clearly not sober to put it lightly.  Well this woman wrecked the freaking car with her nephew in it and then SCREAMED and threw temper tantrums when people were irritated with her and more worried about a three year old kid (because duh.)  She completely bent the frame of the truck but of course faced no consequences.

Speaking of the truck, my boyfriend paid half for that thing and she would SCREAM at us every time we used it and it was always for stupid shit.  One time I moved her inhaler from one cup holder to another and she accused me of trying to hide her medication so she would suffer longer.  

My boyfriend and I ended up moving in together because we both wanted space from our parents.  Things were better and distant, the way I thought we both preferred until I got pregnant.  

His mom became hyper clingy with me.  She deadass sent me pictures of a full blown nursery that she set up at her house and said she couldn't wait for my daughter to stay there.  Umm wtf? No? This woman slept on the couch because she didnt have her own bedroom but made a bedroom for my daughter? Hell no.  She was constantly messaging me and was super hyper fixated on my child.  I expressed the need for boundaries especially because every single thing was accusatory with her.  For example i said she couldnt meet the baby until after we came home because covid would only allow two people in the hospital to see me and I chose my boyfriend and my mom and she texted long paragraphs about how I was selfish and she couldn't see why I was keeping her grandchild from her.  Similarly after having my daughter I told her she couldn't just show up here when she wanted.  She had to ask first abd make sure it was a day that we mentally wanted company.  She made it out that we were keeping the baby from her yet again.

Around this time she did get a little better.  She stopped doing the hard core drugs and told everyone they fixed her bipolar medication.  So YAY everyone is acting like the bitch is cured because she had to get sober for her granddaughter🤦🏻‍♀️.  So for a year now we have been letting her babysit once every so often (1 or 2 times a month for two to three hours) just so we can have a break and get a date night.  I always insist that she has someone with her like my SIL or FIL because she still just isn't completely right in the head.  My fiance says that she never mentally grew older than twelve years old and I need to accept this but whatever.  

Currently I am 7 months pregnant and have been laid off for three months due to lack of transportation (my fiance blew up six cars including mine in the past four years so now un stuck at home all day.)  Well my fiance's solution to me finding a job is to work where he works as a cleaner (its decent pay tbh.) Well he keeps insisting that his mother who lives across the street could babysit our kids M-F while we work together and let me just say I would quite literally get hit by a car before I would allow that.  He has brought this up as a solution at LEAST a half a dozen times.  

Meanwhile she was just here LAST weekend so zooted (because she's allowed to have slip ups right?) That my daughter panicked when she tried to pick her up (she makes my daughter uncomfortable still) and smashed her head off of the porch trying to get away from her.  MIL was too messed up to react, she just stood there while my daughter bled so I had to get up and rush to her even though I was two days out of the hospital from a major fall.  

Just two months ago she was babysitting her neighbors six year old autistic son at the park and kept SCREAMING at her husband for walking away because she would start talking and then forget she was babysitting and panic because she didn't know where the autistic boy went.  FIL said he was keeping an eye on him for her and if she couldn't focus on where he was at then why would she agree to watch him.  YET THIS IS THE WOMAN THATS SUPPOSED TO WATCH MY KIDS?!

I just don't see how this isn't a bigger issue to my boyfriend.  The more I complain about it the pissier he gets too.  He keeps saying that I would be right across the street so it wouldn't be a big deal but WHAT part of this womans behavior says ""I should be trusted alone with kids?!"" I feel like I do plenty by letting MIL come to our house to watch her twice a month but MIL keeps messaging asking why she can't have her.  I've said MULTIPLE times that she is more than welcome to come hang out here with us and my daughter but she is INSISTENT that she should be allowed to have her alone and that she should be spendng nights at this point at MIL's house.  I'm not gonna lie I will never allow a sleepover and the more these ideas get pushed the more I want out of this whole mess.  I've thought about leaving but he has mentioned to me that if I ever left that his mom would for sure be in my kids life because he will be using her as a sitter on his days with the kids.  I just don't see how I took every precaution I could and was SO distanced from this woman before getting pregnant and now because I have kids she has so much say in my life.  AITA?

I turned off my alarm as I got up from bed. After doing my morning routine, I looked outside of my tree's windows to see it was very nice outside. Not a cloud in sight.
Being that I am an Owl, I live in a tree. but it's not what most of you humans imagine when you think of an owls nest. Like you, I have a bed, dresser, rug, Decorations and a coffee machine. Keep in mind. I don't live in a ""tree house"". You know. Those little houses you homosapiens like to make that are built on top of or held up by tree's? The tree IS my house. So I guess you could say we live in house tree's?

I make my way through the front door leading to the balcony. Every bird needs a good balcony for thier front door. Sure, if your on a tight budget, you can get an old fashioned house with a tree branch in front of the door. But it's a real pain to get anything more then yourself through the front door. You have to leave your door open and bring each of the bags one at a time. Which leaves you at risk of being robbed by a squirrel!
Oh... uh right this is meant for humans. Sorry about that. I have a tendency to ramble a bit.
Anyways as I was saying. I went to the balcony. I set my cup of coffee on the table then rested my arms on the balcony railing. Every time I wake up in the late evening. I look out into the night sky and... think. I think quite hard while I drink my coffee. It could be something to do with recent events going on around town or It could be some ideas for maintaining my tree and making it look more ideal to me. although usually it's something about me.
I don't really have anything interesting going on right now. It wouldn't matter to me if there was. It's been a really long time since I cared about going after any sort of life goal. I just let my days go by without much thought.
And so I spend most of my nights here in Sunflower just being depressed. Thinking about what life would be like if I had true strong passions. Or just something that makes going through this life worth it.
I do have this very faint idea of what a ""desire"" is and what I would think I'd enjoy from it. But I know any kind of dream I could have would be nothing more then a ridiculous fantasy. At least... that's what I thought.

As I stood there gazing at the stars. The Mail pigeon arrived at my tree. Despite everyone in this forest writing me off as a misanthrope. The dove still tries to start a conversation with me even though for the past 2 years i've made it clear i'm not one for socializing. ""Good evening ryan. How's it been?"" he said in a friendly manner. ""it's fine"" I replied. ""Well that's great to hear! Any plans for tonight?"" he said with a big smile on his face. ""I don't know..."" we stood there in silence for 5 seconds before he told me to have a good night and then flew off to the next tree. After which, I went straight back to thinking.

I started to hear the sound of leafs being stepped on below me. I started to look all around the balcony to check if I could see anything. Sure enough, I could just about make out the siloute of an animal. I walked over to the large flash light sitting next to the door and shined it at the ground. there I saw a wolf walking around the forest floor. When I shined the light on them. They noticed the light, saw me then proceeded to sit down and stare.
Being stared at by a predator isn't anything new for us birds. It used to be pretty Common a long time ago for predators to gather around a tree that was home to either old birds or birds who lived around or on top of tree's. It was likely that someday one of those birds will end up falling down by accident. Now & days tree's have greatly improved in terms of safety. It's also really rare for any birds to live on the exterior of tree's rather then the interior. So most of them have stopped lurking around us like... those birds who work at the mortuary. I think you guys call them vultures?
With all that being said. Im not sure what makes this wolf want to target me. I'm pretty young and this balcony is very secure and well made. the wolf doesn't even look like it's trying to intimidate me. They look curious more then anything.
As I stood there watching the wolf observe me and my tree. I move my wing/hand over to grab the coffee mug. But it wasn't there.
""Looking for something?"" I turned my head around to see a squirrel holding my mug. Before I could do or say anything. The squirrel splashed the coffee over my face, then pushed me off the balcony. I tried to fly but i was too disoriented by the coffee. I panicked and yelled as I came crashing down to the grass below.

The pain from the coffee and now broken wing made it hard for me to stand back up. I froze in fear as I saw the wolf still sitting there. At that point, I gave up on trying to stand up. Not only because there is no way that I could ever out run a wolf but well, honestly. I just knew that letting myself stay alive would do no one any good. That squirrel has probably already broken into my house and stolen the few things that matter to me. Not to mention the amount of money it would take to pay of the medical bills to fix my wing up.
I was more then willing to accept my fate. I didn't scream out for help. I just laid there watching the wolf get closer and closer. All that I could... or rather wanted to hope for was that I made for a delicious meal.
Finally, the wolf had reached me. I laid there breathing heavily and shaking as they towerd over me. They still had this curious look on them. Like as if they've never seen an owl before. I couldn't take it anymore. I just wanted this to be over. ""Please, Please just eat me already!"" The wolf then shook thier head left and right implying they didn't want to. I was caught off guard by that response. But I didn't want them to just leave me. I was ready to die that night. ""No!? What do you mean no? Owls taste great I promise!"" The wolf still refused. I was starting to get angry. ""PLEASE! JUST PLEASE DO IT! I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE!!!"" I shouted as one last attempt to convince them to end me.
The wolf stood there. now with a shocked expression on there face. out of pure exhaustion. I closed my eyes and laid back waiting for somthing to happen. as I did, I began to hear... crying? I opened my eyes and saw them with thier paws over their eyes with tears flowing down thier face. eventually, they lowered their paws to see i was staring at them. They got back up on all fours and headed off to a direction that went a little outside of the area the balcony lights lit up. They immediately came back carrying a basket. They dropped the basket right next to me. They slowly and gently picked me up with their jaws and sat me down in the basket. They then, after everything that had just happened between us. She spoke to me ""Everything will be okay, I promise"" And with that, She carried me off into the darkness.",1,1728628448.0,story,0,1.0,False
1g13kbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pimax/comments/1g13kbl/so_much_disappointment/,So much disappointment ,"I'm on my 3rd round of lens replacement.  Received my PCL three months ago.  Out of the box it wasn't usable with the left lens so bad I couldn't focus and got headaches after 5 minutes.  The right was better, but had some distorted areas where it would distort by ""pinching"" and ""expanding"" as you pan over the area.  This created almost a vertigo like affect if you looked around.

Got onto support, all good they'll send me a replacement set of lenses.  Month later I get the  package, but it only contains one (left lens).  I reach out to support, and they're very sorry, their mistake - they'll send a right lens asap.  Good news is the left replacement lens is good.  I can now see why everyone says this is a good headset.  But I still cannot really use it as the distortions in the right lens, while clear, makes it impossible to use for more than 15 minutes without getting dizzy/vertigo.  So headset goes back in the box.

Another month later I get the replacement right lens.  Except it's clearly a used lens, comes shipped dirty and with no protective film.  Feels like they had one that was lying around the warehouse  and just grabbed it, slapped it into a ziplock bag with some bubble wrap and into the mail.  After cleaning it up (including some hard caked on dirt like dried coffee droplets) I install it and it still has issues.   So I contact support, they're very sorry.  They'll send me another replacement and this time they'll make sure it's good, clean and properly packaged.

While I wait another month for the next replacement, I start using the PCL.  The replacement right lens still had distortion, but less than the original and importantly in fewer spots and further away from the center of the lens.  It's still frustrating and breaks the immersion when you see it, but I can ignore it.  Over the next month I actually start to enjoy the headset and see its potential, only disrupted when I have to look to the top left and I see the distortion/faulty spot again.  But I start getting excited for when the good lens finally arrives and I can use the PCL as intended.

And that brings us to today.  Another month gone, and I finally get the new lens!  I rush ti install it and.... it's the worst lens yet.  🥺  Big wobbly distortions all over.  Like looking through a fishbowl.  Totally unusable.

So much disappointment.

Not sure where to from here.  I really want the PCL to work.  If I could only get a good right lens it would be awesome.  (and I know its possible, as the replacement left lens is perfect) But I don't know if I can continue with the current cycle of

1g13ibs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1g13ibs/feeling_like_the_worst_nurse_ever/,Feeling like the worst nurse ever,"It’s probably the most inflammable feeling ever. I’m starting to think I’m bound to be shit. I’m big on older people seeing things, regular folks won’t be able to see. But I kid you not, had a shitty beginning as an new grad at my workplace. Had a senior RN say I’m always making mistakes, and never getting anything right. And i kid you not, I’m constantly making mistakes. We had gotten agency RN one time, and this RN goes in front of them, “see, I taught them once, and they’re okay”. That’s fine. I move on.

I’m very much someone people would call peculiar in terms of personality, however, I’ve heard them call me countless of things. Like literally in my first week, I barely said anything, and I overheard another senior RN and a senior physiotherapist call me slow and autistic. Like really? Salty for nothing. But I digress.

I remember a time that stood out, where i took forever to document, because i was stuck in the hospital mindset of things. Doing documentation towards the end of the shift. I was staying back past my regular hours and i hated it. I wasn’t getting paid extra for it, but i cared about the patients. I really ducking did and still do. To have the same senior RN purposely make themselves a cup of coffee sit it right at the computer i was doing documentation at and act like I wasn’t there when i came back to find them there. I suppose they despised me. Don’t care. The least you could do is be respectful. Even through all that, i never once cussed or showed any signs of disrespect. At times i wish i gave them a piece of my mind, but i know myself its not worth it.

Besides from that, I’m at fault for so many things. Forgetting to hand over things, going blank when i get asked questions, can’t think for myself, its horrific.

I’ve noticed that most of the time, I’m oddly the one to catch deterioration, and hear from other people in the multidisciplinary team that what i saw happen a week or so ago. Just to check progress notes and not see anything.

This is starting to read as a rant so I’ll close it up.

I’m starting to loose fuel and energy. I really care for these patients. But, I’m starting to think I’m not cut out for it.
I’m not one to argue, even when they’re clearly in the wrong cos I believe it gets you nowhere. The only thing you can do is to get them to think. In which I try to do in a way through ignoring them and moving along. It’s been hard to see new RNs hired and doing so much better than you regardless of the fact that they have more experience than me. It’s whatever.

I do declare myself to be the worst nurse. 
Does anyone feel like the worst nurse ever sometimes?

My friend (D) bought Ethiopia Kochere coffee beans from a coffee shop yesterday. It's priced at 2,500 Philippine Peso (around 44 US Dollars) for a 250 gram bag.

He then consulted me  and my other friend (R) if the coffee beans are good. We were alarmed by the price considering that it's the most expensive coffee beans we've got our hands on (except for the Luwak).  Both R and I are coffee enthusiasts/home baristas so we're kind of feeling off with the price.

Take note that the beans do not have a roast date but production date (May 2024 and the expiration date is Nov 2024)

We contacted the shop and they insisted that it is from a high grade roaster from Qatar (we're from the Philippines btw).

We tried searching the internet for the same variation and some roasters sell the same beans for 20 USD per 250 grams.

Just wanted to know your opinion on this situation.

THIS ISNT A LEMON. THERES NO JUICE IN THESE LEMONS. I DONT EVEN WANT THEM.” 

i proceed to calmly tell her, “ma’am, you asked for one lemon, & i brought you three……” this SET HER OFF. she continued to rant about the abomination of lemons i gave her, saying she could not possibly do anything with the lemons, asking me what i expected HER to do. 

i then did something very controversial: i told her i believed she was being very rude to me. GASP. i said the thing! she was gobsmacked that i had the audacity to stand up for myself & told me she was NOT being rude. i then informed her id be back. i cut up an ENTIRE lemon into quarters, & delivered it to the table, WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE. 

she had flagged down my angel of a GM before i arrived with said lemon. he was explaining to her that i had multiple tables & i couldn’t stress mysef out over her lemons, & that i hadn’t done anything wrong. i thanked him for his service, & he left. the lovely lady chose not to eat, but i served her mother a good breakfast, & her mother tipped me 20%. my GM told me if she comes in again & wants an entire lemon, there’s an upcharge ☠️ 

in essence, i got into an argument over a fkn lemon water today, i stood up for myself, & i won 💅🏻 ",9,1728628041.0,Serverlife,3,0.92,False

I’m a graduate student (afab 22) and need to go into the city for my research sometimes. I’m a new driver, so with all questions assume I am navigating from a Lite Rail blue line station.

1. What coffee shops do y’all recommend? Was disappointed by the apparent lack of cafes near UNCC main campus.

2. What streets should I avoid as a feminine/queer person walking alone? This is still the south and being afab.. is what it is.

3. As a student and researcher, are there any resources in the city that I should know about?

4. What are some cheap lunch places near the lite rail? 

5. Any witchy/spiritual shops in the city y’all might recommend?

---------------------------------------

A knock on the cabin door. 

Separating himself from his coffee, Colonel Loprey grabs his uniform jacket, and heads towards the door calling out; “Who is it?""

""Ensign Smith sir. We received a signal.”

""So many Smiths on this station. I'm starting to think it's an intentional joke from higher up.” Loprey mumbles to himself. Opening the door, he continues ahead of the enlisted crewman. “What do you have for me?""

“Not much sir"", came the voice from behind, “We received it a couple of minutes ago and I immediately left the bridge to get you.""

Arriving on the bridge Col Loprey took in a quick scan of his crew working diligently. ""Signals, what have you got for me?”

""Audio and visual transmission sir. About 45 seconds long before it cuts out.”

""Put it on screen.” Col Loprey commanded as he took his place in the center of the deck.

Sounds of blaster fire filled the deck, static giving way to an alien face shouting to be heard over the sounds of a battle raging on around them. An explosion nearby causes the figure to flinch and move the camera allowing Col Loprey to catch a glimpse of their unnamed enemy entering a doorway. A few more moments of shouting before the transmission is cut. In the deafening silence of the deck, Loprey wass transported back by the voice of his senior signals crewman. “That's everything we have sir.""

Immediately Col Loprey begins formulating plans and possible outcomes. “Do we have a lock on the location yet?""

“Not yet sir. We should here in a couple of minutes.""

“As soon as you do, send a probe. I want everything we can get on that planet."" Turning to the other side of the command deck, “Linguistics, anything?""

“Not much sir. It's not long enough for us to build anything solid. There are some similarities in pattern to a few other races, but that could just be coincidence.”

""We have a lock and the probe is en route sir. ETA is 13 hours."" came a voice from his signals crew.

Spinning on his heels, Loprey turned his attention back to signals. ""Good. As soon as we begin getting data, I want it sent to my terminal and notified.""

Col Loprey retired to quarters. He hated the delay of space. He knew that fidgeting in front of his crew was a bad look. So he always awaited news in his personal living area. He was pacing when a rapid knock on his cabin door derailed his train of thought.

Another ensign, out of breath, “We're receiving data sir.""

Loprey didn't wait for the ensign as he swiftly made his way to the command deck. As he entered through the door he immediately looked to his crew and approached his terminal. ""Intel. What do you have for me?”

""Enemy presence confirmed. Standard array of 3 Juggernauts, 5 Battle-cruisers, 2 Carriers and planet stripping layout. Standard large garden planet, sentient native race, just coming into their industrial time frame by the looks of some of the untouched places yet. Must have stumbled upon them. Interestingly, the planet was on our radar to be checked out for the possibility of life, but wasn't on the docket for another few months.”

“Good work."" Col Loprey nodded and turned his attention homeward. “Communications. Open up a channel to the council for me.""

A few minutes later Loprey was face to face with the council representative of all listening outposts. “Ma’am. This is Colonel Loprey of Paynal Station. We have received a transmission requiring immediate attention. Enemy presence confirmed already on planet. I am sending you everything I have.”

""Understood Colonel. I will take this to the council immediately. Thank you.""

---------

After a few hours attempting to sleep Loprey gave up fighting his racing mind and dragged his exhausted body from his bed. After showering and putting on a fresh uniform, he decided to head to the bridge. Leaving his doorway, he saw a young ensign shuffling down the hall with the look of a dog with its tail tucked between its legs.

Realizing the new presence in the hallway, the ensign stopped and stammered “I… I'm sorry sir. The council has denied your request for action.”

Rushing to his terminal on the command deck, Loprey opened up a message from the councilwoman.

-\* “I'm sorry commander. We can't save everyone."" \*-

Col Loprey looked up, scanning his crew around the deck, looking for something, anything, an idea on how to proceed. A mix of solemn faces and those looking to distract themselves with continued focus on their work. He had heard rumors, transmissions getting to listening outposts too late, ships can't make it in time. Arriving to smoldering ruins of planets or just as the last enemy ships leave the area. It happens, but he had hoped it wouldn't happen to him, his crew.

Just then a large banner flashed up on the main screen. A still image from the transmission they received, “If you receive this transmission, do not respond. The council has been notified. No action is to be taken.""

Col Loprey stood up from leaning over his terminal. Squared his shoulders and cleared his throat. ""Alright everyone. That's it. The council has made their decision. Archive the data. Unfortunately we can't save everyone. If anyone feels they'd like some extra time off to process this, shift leads, they have my blessing.”

With that, Loprey turned and proceeded to his quarters with a very controlled and measured pace. Upon return, he collapsed into his lounge chair and picked up his personal data pad.

*Secure Channel: G.H.O.S.T* (Galactic Harmony Operations & Special Tactics)

>Willum…. *SECURE*

* Loprey: Willum. I've got something for you. Your eyes only.
* Willum: Is it that you want to come back and babysit us again?
* Loprey: I'd love to, but you know they put me out to pasture after your stunt at Milliways. I'm sending you the data I have.

------------------------------------------------------------

A knock from an exterior door. 

Odd. We all looked around and counted ourselves. Sure enough, all twenty-three of us were present. It was a mixed air of emotions because while our supply shipment was over a week late, the noise from the door sounded like none any of us had heard before. Not to mention that as far as we knew, we were the first of our species to make it this far south on our planet. Since the tardiness of our supplies, emotions have gone from annoyed, to upset, to concern and now genuine fear. Slowly rising from our seats and exchanging glances, the youngest of us managed to summon the courage to check the door. With a shriek, he flung the door wide open and stumbled backwards as six large creatures entered in, pointing weapons first at us and then our surroundings. The first one quickly raised his weapon supporting hand  in front of him and spread his digits apart. While he froze and stared at us, the other five spread around and searched our quarters as if searching for something. After a few moments short barks came from the five searching our quarters and then the first one seemed to relax, putting his hand and weapon down and then removing his facial covers. From a pouch on his back he pulled a small pad and drug his finger along making strange markings. He turned the pad to us to reveal the markings and tapped under them twice. ""Willum"" a voice said from within the pad and their leader placed his hand on his chest. He repeated this again and then repeated the word himself. From there uneasy introductions were made. Then came the teaching of our language to the speaking pad. It began like teaching a small child but by the end of the day it was like speaking to one of our own. As progress was made, our unease lifted and we shared food with the aliens within our dwelling. It was quite perplexing, while two of them looked similar to Willum, the other two were clearly different species from Willum and each other. We took turns teaching the talking pad and during our break away from it we noticed that Willum and his crew seemed uneasy. Not hostile or impatient, just... uneasy. Like they knew more that they were unsure about sharing. When we were done, Willum took the pad and wrote in his own language. Then turning the pad towards us, he tapped a square on the screen and his markings were translated to ours and the voice within spoke the words aloud! ""Hello, my name is Willum and this is my crew."" Then, Willum tapped a circle at the bottom of the screen and spoke in his own language and when he was done, he tapped it again. Again, the pad spoke in our language! ""We have come from beyond your star to rescue you.""

Immediately there was an eruption of questions and Willum raised both of his arms to settle the room. He spoke at length and explained the ancient race that had come to ravage our planet, the other races rescued from their planets which his two non-human crew members attested to, and the lack of time we had left. For a while he answered questions, but not all of them. He said we needed to spend the night processing our new fates. He told us to rest and that we'd reconvene in the morning. Rest, because he knew as well as we did that none of us would sleep that night. Except for his crew, which took shifts inside of their ship.

In the morning we gathered our personal belongings and squeezed into their ship. Willum showed us images of our planet from their probe above. Many of us cried as we watched the fires and smoke consuming our planet. We noted that the last populated port where we all gathered before leaving for this leg of our journey, seemed yet untouched. So it was there we landed. 

With our combined efforts, we convinced the townspeople of what had befallen our planet. Once we had settled everyone down and Willum had answered questions, he informed us that he and his crew would need a bigger ship. They told us to give them two days. Gather everything we could and prepare to leave. If they didn't return after two days, we could either flee to our research post in the south and pray, or go out swinging.

So we did what they asked. They took off on their ship and immediately the town was buzzing. The library and school were emptied of every book. Every single document and historical item gathered. Livestock gathered, fields and seeds prepared. Everything that could be packed, we did. 

On the evening of the second day, we all gathered in the town hall to discuss what to do next, when suddenly the ground shook beneath us and a low hum filled our ears. Outside in an empty field, a ship a great multitude larger than Willums set down. When the main ramp let down, Willum and his crew emerged with smiles on their faces and told us to load as quickly as we could. They assured us that we were safe temporarily and that the blood splattering their armor was *mostly* not theirs. Something about very lax ground security measures in uncontested space.

With immense effort and surprising speed, we managed to squeeze everything we wanted onto the freighter. Somehow the humans had even managed to nose their ship in, and we packed our belongings right up alongside it. As soon as the last items were packed, buildings and people triple accounted for, we collapsed. Some did not rest the entire time we loaded the ship and were soon asleep atop crates and random home furnishings. With our anonymous approval, the humans did not miss a beat getting us into the air. We crowded view ports and watched as our burning world shrunk behind us. Many wailed, some sang farewells, one of the towns priests led prayers.

After a while, when everyone had settled and most had slept, Willum came to us with news. Contact had been made with their grand council and arrangements were being made for us. We were heading to a station for a quarantine and to give them time to decide where we should go. Apparently, as soon as word got out what this human crew had done for us, at least a dozen different races immediately offered to take us in.

Sitting atop the human ship, I saw one of the humans fidgeting with a map of our world on his speaking pad. After a bit, he had spread it out and began writing “723rd G.H.O.S.T’s” above and “.583067000001"" below it. When I asked him what it meant, he explained that 723rd is their unit. The lower number is for this being the 58th planet humans have encountered like this, 3,067 survivors - 000001 For all the ones we couldn’t save.",14,1728627275.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
