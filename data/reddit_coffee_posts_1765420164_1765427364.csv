The worlds changed, and I can go sit now and lecture you like they would in school but truthfully, I could not tell you jack about it. What I can say is there's two types of people now, those obsess over what caused all of this and those that accept it, and they try make a life within it.

I helped get water to where they needed it, helped the elder than I get from place to place and repair the odd fence or door here and there.

It was roundabout when the military showed up we knew that whatever happened was bad, I volunteered as a pair of hand to get them going. They termed our small village into a well-oiled outpost. Not much changed besides the fences with their towers and turrets. It was ridiculous, they did not tell us at the time what was going on, but everyone knew it was nothing good.

After a month or so, getting used to this new way of living with our new men in blue, everyone one was told there'd be a meeting held in the square. It was some basic housekeeping and some long overdue apologies and thanks. They introduced some new rules, one which created a fair uproar was the curfew,  we don’t like to tolerate that sort of mindset, the rules said that past sundown no-one is to leave the village and everyone is to stay in their homes and the second was that in the event of cannon fire that one is to come outside.

Now I don’t need to explain why people got upset at this, it's all plain to see there was something really amiss in our little home.  
Of course, people don’t like listening out here, they prefer their own way of things, so naturally people did what they wanted to, that was, until the first 1022 reports came in. People would up and go, and well you know how this goes, they usually won't come back. 

They don’t get far much either. Would not take too long before we heard the muffled crumpling of metal upon metal against the tar. Sometimes, if we were unfortunate enough, their voice would reach us, either after the car got torn up and other times it crawls across the valleys in the late night hours,  long past after the crash.

This went on for once…twice…mmm, I think by the fifth night bein woken up by a neighbors aching voice did it for them, took about 5 of us before the military decided to go take a look outside and tell us what we have been hearing. 

If you thought that they told us it was a freak accident, well you damn right, they would come back and keep us out, saying it was ""mechanical failure"" or they fell asleep and swerved from the road.

We all knew that was horseshit.



Against all holy reason, these events caused more people to leave town and evidently the more 1022 reports to appear at the town halls desks.

There were things said, there were people beat, but in the end we came to a understanding, more on our side than theirs. People tend to behave when guns get pointed back at them.

There were new job opportunities coming into town they said,  apparently we were not the only settlement in this predicament and to help places like us came the Roadside Assistance and Safety Bureau, and they wanted to open up shop.

The jobs sounded pretty simple, either you help the maintenance people repair or you find the things needing repair. They gave us the normal speech of jobsite dangers and all that jargon, im sure they people appreciated hearing that again.

Anyway I happen to have some history with laying tarmac in these valleys and a few good years of hard labor still left within me , I decided to give in my name and sign the dotted line.

It's been unsuccessful so far probably cause I've been applying the last month, so this time around, I've decided to apply early that I've started now. 

I haven't gotten any interviews with this resume, and I was wondering if I should rewrite my research experience? I felt like I didn't do too much that was relevant, it was mostly game design and coding the animations for the game and literature review. I didn't do any relevant data analysis or of that sort. Should I change the dates I was there? Cause it was only during the school year, and during the later half of those years, I got switched to a different project where I just really didn't do anything except listening in.

Also, should I get rid of my RA experience? I left after 1 semester cause of personal reasons. Should I get rid of my architecture class experience too? They're CAD drawings, but they're a bit rough looking.

I'm located on the East Coast, targeting industrial engineering internships, but also process and manufacturing roles. I've been applying to local jobs, just anything anywhere cause I'm feeling pretty desperate ngl with this job market.

Looking for honest feedback from students.,"Hey all, I’m a recent graduate, and for a while I ran resume/cover letter workshops at my school. I kept noticing the same pain points: people stuck on where to start, how to tailor to each job, or how to make their stuff actually match what companies want.

That inspired me to build a little [tool](https://rezzy.dev) around those real problems (not just a dumb GPT wrapper, it’s informed by recruiter feedback and years of workshop experience). 

It lets you:

• generate tailored resumes & cover letters (paste the job description and it adapts them)

• research company culture/values for more specific cover letters

• use role profiles trained on successful examples

• score your resume and track all versions in one dashboard

[Try it out here!](https://rezzy.dev)

It’s $4.99/month (cheaper than a fancy coffee) and we already have 160+ users, but I’m mostly here to learn, not promote. I’d love honest feedback from people actually applying to internships/jobs right now:

• What's your biggest struggle when writing resumes/cover letters?

• Do any of the features above sound actually helpful?

• What would make you actually want to use something like this?

1pjo7bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pjo7bz/aitah_for_missing_too_much_dance_practice/,AITAH for missing too much dance practice?,"I am in a kpop dance club at my university. I joined last year after I heard about it, and started going to their weekly workshops, where anyone could sign up to teach the chorus choreography for an hour, and it would be filmed. That part is open to anyone. They also do full cover, usually about 4, every semester, and I decided to sign up for one, and I got in. After all the dues were paid, we got to work learning the choreo, and it became very clear to me that there is a clique made up of all the executives and their friends. Most of the people in this cover were part of the clique, and I found myself multiple times waiting in the practice room alone, only to see everyone in the clique and the other members of the cover walking in together because they all went out to coffee or to get lunch. Other than that, I was mostly friendly with them, but I just always felt like I was being ostracized. 

Next semester, in the spring, I signed up to run my own cover, and the people in my cover were amazing. It was a very difficult dance, and I am still so proud of them! The only problems I had were with the executives, because at the beginning of the semester, I was told that my cover and another cover were going to be performing at another team's showcase, so we had to have similar outfits. The other cover leader and I texted about it, and we agreed that her outfits would be black and red, and mine would be all red. The entire semester goes by, and one of my teammates, who is in both dances, asked how much time they would have to change in between dances. I didn't know, so I asked the club president. They sent this long message about how disappointed they were in me that  I didn't tell them what my outfit plans were because they wanted all of the performers' outfits to be the same, as both dances were going back to back. I told them I was disappointed that the president and vice president failed to communicate any of that with me, and they specifically said similar outfits. It was this whole thing, but I got to speak with the president of the other dance team and got us some time to change outfits. They said they were disappointed I went behind the executive's back to talk to the other team's leadership, but I had an exec with me, the treasurer, so I am still unclear about what the problem is.

We filmed the cover right before finals, and I ended up homeless for most of the summer, and was living out of my car and couch surfing where I could until I could move into my new apartment. I was in an awful mental state, and two family members had major health scares. It was not communicated to me that it was my responsibility to edit the video myself. I don't really know how to do that, but after this year's execs asked where the video was, I tried my best and sent it in, but it didn't fit their ""style"" I struggled to make a video I thought would please them and eventually the new social media mangar asked to have the footage and she would do it herself.

At the start of this latest semester, I had a meeting with the new president and vice president to talk about how badly I was communicating with execs over the summer (fair, I sucked at that), and to talk about expectations. I apologized, and we went to our next classes. I signed up to be in two covers, and both started out kinda rocky. I had plans that were set in stone over the summer that all unfortunately seemed to land on practice days. One of the covers had practice on Friday and Sunday, but I could only attend the Friday practices due to my work schedule. I ended up with food poisoning and couldn't go to even more practices. I felt really bad, but I was trying to keep up. There was one practice where one by one, we all had to individually do our parts in front of everyone else. Everyone else seemed to be so much better than me, and I ended up going last, and I just froze. I kept messing up, and it was just really bad. The cover leader texted me after practice with a long message saying, ""I mean this in the nicest way possible, I need you to lock in."" I knew the choreography, I just hadn't mentally prepared myself to be criticized like we were and I siked myself out. The other cover had a practice where an exec would come in and stop us whenever we messed up until we got it right. Most people were not going to be there, including me, as this practice was on Sunday and I had work. The vice president texted me asking me where I was, and I told her about how the cover leader and I had agreed that I only had to come to Friday practice because I had work, and she never responded. 

Yesterday was film day for both of the covers I was in. I was early, and I was excited to have a finished product for both of the dances. We film the first one, and the entire time, I feel like I am being ostracized. No one is listening to me. Every time I try to directly talk to someone, they look at me like I'm stupid, or act like I never said anything. The actual filming went smoothly, and when we were done, I walked silently to the bus stop behind two members who were yapping away and acting as if I wasn't there. When I got on the bus, I got a text from the president saying that they don't want me to sign up for anything next semester, as I had a ""lack of care."" They said they were willing to talk about it in person and would be willing to reevaluate next fall, but I just said that I understood and that I was sorry. I then got a dm from another member who showed me that they had been sent a similar message. I went home, and I cried. Even though it felt like no one in this club liked me, I was willing to bear all the weirdness if it meant I could be on stage and dance, and not being able to do that for the foreseeable future with my club hurts my heart. A couple of hours later, I got in my car and drove to the second filming location. It felt so awkward. I don't think I have ever felt so dejected, and it was clear that no one except for the execs (including the one who sent me the message) was there. We filmed for about an hour and a half in 20 degree weather. Once we were done, I got in my car, barely let it heat up, said goodbye to the cover leader, and sped out of there.

I am not really sure where to go from here. The club has a history of kicking out people the clique doesn't like, regardless of whether they have actually done anything. I don't know if I should sit down and talk to them. I doubt anything I have to say would make any difference to them. Do I just wait until next year and hope things have changed, or should I not look back? There are other dance teams here, but none are K-pop specific. Am I being stupid? I need advice! Or a reality check if you deem appropriate.",1,1765426542.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1. Safety first – no sharp corners!

Kid-friendly & shin-saving. Perfect for tight living rooms where you’re constantly squeezing past.

2. Hidden storage = visual calm

Lift-top or drawer designs stash remotes, blankets, magazines, board games… instantly makes your room look “minimalist” even if you’re not.

3. The “flow” factor

The curved shape naturally guides movement around the room — feels more open and less blocky than a rectangle.

4. Style chameleon

Works with mid-mod, boho, Scandi, even industrial looks. Softens a boxy sofa.

***Previously on Hell’s Kitchen…***

***Both teams were ready for a new challenge to start the day off positive, but for Chef Ramsay…***

“*I’ve got something very special in store for today…*” *- Ramsay*

***He would call in a couple of reinforcements…***

“*Introducing… Michael Schwartz!*” *- Ramsay*

***And…***

“*Norman van Aken!*” *- Ramsay*

***Who helped him oversee the next challenge, where both teams will create fusion cuisine…***

“*Made using the freshest ingredients possible.*” *- Ramsay*

***Most of the teams seemed to find rhythm in what to create for the challenge…***

“*Yeah, I think these flavors are getting us somewhere.*” *- Isabela*

***While one seemed a bit confused to say the least…***

“*Let’s try and make a soup with this.*” *- Edward*

“*Soup’s not my first choice to go with…*” *- Sierra*

***Some dishes impressed the three judges…***

“*I was wondering if I can borrow your dish for a catering idea, because it’s a must-have.*” *- Van Aken*

“*It seems like you had to go through an incredible effort to use this many ingredients for your dish.*” *- Schwartz*

***And others have made them wonder if it even deserved to be fused together.***

“*This kind of gumbo needs a diaper to carry, not chopsticks…*” *- Ramsay*

“*It almost feels like you’re playing it safe*.” *- Schwartz*

***Ultimately, the Red Team would win the challenge via a tiebreaker, earning them a day at Brickell City Centre for a shopping trip, while the Blue Team were left to make batches of capellini for their service, as well as prep both kitchens.***

“*We’re living the high life here, man!*” *- Rio*

***During the dinner service, van Aken and Schwartz were present as VIP diners, and for Chef Ramsay…***

“*This is very important, because they’ll be demanding to see some flashes of talent from what I see as the finest here.*” *- Ramsay*

***However, everyone’s attempts to recreate the previous service’s magical service… kept backfiring…***

“*What the fuck?!*” *- Ramsay*

***Between Allison making one miscalculation…***

“*Risotto, one more- oh, fuck…*” *- Allison*

***Too many…***

“*This shouldn’t be this difficult!*” *- Ramsay*

***Ruben and Isabela serving too many issues on Meat…***

“*This filet’s fuckin’ raw like ice…*” *- Isabela*

***With a little more help from Allison…***

“*Look at how piss-poor this duck is!*” *- Ramsay*

***And Henri serving the wrong Garnish…***

“*Did you order fingerling potatoes as your side?*” *- Ramsay*

“*Absolutely not.*” *- Van Aken*

***Twice…***

“*Why’d you send potatoes again, Henri?!*” *- Ramsay*

***While the Blue Team had their own predicaments, between David mismanaging the Appetizers…***

“*I’m not letting that shit get served, hell or high water!*” *- Ramsay*

“*Christ…*” *- David*

***Dani and Sierra’s fish flops…***

“*This halibut’s oozing with fucking grease!*” *- Ramsay*

***And plenty of other sporadic miscues…***

“*This sauce is so sweet, you can call it candy at this point!*” *- Ramsay*

***But none were as terrifying as Edward’s Meat mayhem…***

“*This isn’t fast-food, Edward, this is fine dining, as it should be!*” *- Ramsay*

***That scarred not just his teammates, and everyone there to bear witness…***

“*You make one more mistake, and you’re done!*” *- Ramsay*

“*Ugh…!*” *- Edward*

***But himself…***

“*Nooo!!*” *- Edward*

***Which was enough for Chef Ramsay to pull the plug on his run in the competition…***

“*It’s for your own good.*” / “*We’ll figure it out, I promise.*” *- Ramsay*

***In the end, neither team won, but Chef Ramsay wanted someone else to go home. The Red Team. But because it was a stalemate, he would call down…***

“*Dani,*” / “*Sierra,*” / *“David,*” / “*Henri,*” / “*Isabela,*” / “*Allison,*” *- Ramsay*

***In the end, Chef Ramsay eliminated…***

“*Henri.*” *- Ramsay*

***For his deteriorating performances, as well as backing up his exceptional prowess, which meant the end of not his, but also Edward’s, dreams of becoming head chef of Hell’s Kitchen Miami, and earning a quarter million dollar salary.***

***And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…***

Upon Ramsay telling both teams to fuck off back to the dorms, everyone would head down the hallway, with a rain cloud hanging over everyone’s heads. Allison would state in her confessional of everything that went down; from Edward self-imploding, to Henri getting eliminated… It should come to no one’s surprise that not just her team, but also the Blue Team, are dealing with shittons of crap. 

Everyone would return to the dorms, everything in fog. Nobody seemed to be in the mood to mingle or talk to one another. However, David would storm over to the kitchen and punch a plastic bowl off the island. Samuel would immediately spot this and go over to check on him, telling him to take it easy, while Sierra stated in her confessional that this is why David was on that slate to begin with; him being too frazzled caused him to screw everything up during service; that and Edward leaving the competition. David would sigh and apologize, but Samuel would state he understands; he’s upset about everything too, as Samuel would make his own confessional of how in spite of not going home despite being nominated by Ramsay, he feels like he’s the reason behind Edward’s collapse, because both of them were on the Meat station, and he had plenty of opportunities to help him; he didn’t realize it he helped him too late. Meanwhile, Ruben would snark at how much of a pussy Edward was for falling to the pressure so embarrassingly, betting it must’ve been ugly. Dani, who heard what Ruben said, would ask what that’s supposed to mean, and Ruben would clarify that this is the ‘big boys’ territory’ now, and Edward falling off means one less loser to carry on their backs, telling the Blue Team they should be grateful they wouldn’t have a liability. An offended Dani would march over to him, telling that’s the most ignorant, disgusting– only for Isabela to hold her back, pleading with her that this isn’t worth it, though Ruben would continue mocking Dani, hedging bets if she and him are having some secret love affair behind the cameras. Things started to get even more tense amongst each other, everyone’s voices getting louder with each one trying to talk over the other, and before things would come to a boiling point, Freddie slammed a hardcover book onto the coffee table, making everyone stop what they’re doing and turn, surprised that the normally level-headed Freddie was now pissed. Freddie would holler at them to knock it off, stating that this night is already horrible enough, but now they’re making it even worse, suggesting they all stop for a minute before they even think of acting like an animal. Tem would express shock in her confessional, as this is the first time she’s seen Freddie angry. Freddie would sigh, continuing his spiel, and tell everyone that he understands that Edward had to leave the competition, telling them that he’s gonna miss him too, and that he definitely deserved to be here, to get back into action, but he never tripped out because he was a pussy, leering at Ruben’s direction, but he says this is Hell’s Kitchen; this kitchen can and will break us down, and that’s exactly what it did to all of them; not just Edward, and even Henri. Ruben would state in his confessional that Freddie thinks he knows all just because he’s so preachy, but he scoffs by stating he doesn’t know why ‘Mr. Football’ is talking; last he checked, he nearly tripped himself back in the Seafood Night service some nights ago, and if he’s trying to get into Ramsay’s good graces, then he should go fuck himself; adding to the ‘audience’ it shouldn’t come to anyone’s surprise he’s not so fond of him anymore, not after he tried to 'exile him' out of Hell's Kitchen. Freddie would continue his rant by stating this is the failure they all needed, addressing the previous night’s service, stating that they’ve had their fun then, but they need to burn tonight’s failure into their minds, because Ramsay will toss more people out of the competition if he has to; and this should not come through pointing fingers at each other. After Freddie would finish, Isabela would chime in to both teams that she agrees, explaining that tonight just wasn’t their night, but they should at least have a much better fighting effort to get things back into gear. She would follow that up in her confessional by saying that she respects Freddie and his efforts, even if they’re on different teams; Edward and Henri will be missed, she says, but she cannot let their evictions nor their own failures nag them anymore than they have tonight. Everyone would gradually start to voice their own opinions on wanting to put tonight behind them, and Rio would state in his confessional that he doesn’t blame Freddie for snapping at everyone, even if it did scare him a bit, because they all fucked up tonight, and if neither Ramsay nor any of the sous chefs can’t get them into shape, then they have to at least try. Everyone else promised each other to become stronger the next day, as they would collectively call it a night, going to sleep. Freddie would make one last confessional before bed, stating that he knows this was their night to shine, and he’s gonna miss Edward and Henri, but now can’t be the time to continue sulking about it; it’s not what his old coach and teammates would want him; he’s sure of that; this should be the night where everyone should get stronger from here on out. 

\-----

**Challenge**

It was a brand new day in Hell’s Kitchen, and everyone was hoping for a better day than the one they had before. They meet Ramsay in the dining room, and after lining up, he seemed a lot perkier and optimistic than the previous day. He tells everyone that last night was an ugly one for all of them, but today, he hopes to put it all aside for something he has in store. He gestures to them to look out into the dining room. In the dining room was a makeshift pirate ship setting, complete with a nice wooden deck, and a lovely sail. In her confessional, Kara wonders if they’re going to play as pirates. However, Ramsay orders both sous chefs to bring out the barrels, and Shayna asks in her confessional what they have… James and Michelle appear on top of the deck, opening barrel kegs, holding out countless numbers of containers. Ramsay would ask them what each container had, and Michelle would toss it down from the deck for Marino to catch. The maitre d’ opened the lid to give each contestant a whiff of what it smelled like, starting with Rio, who points out it smells like strawberries. Passing it down, each chef smelled the strawberry scents, with Ramsay asking if they loved the smell of it. In her confessional, Isabela says that it smells so desserty, she wonders if it goes on cakes or pastries. Ramsay would confirm that it is strawberry pie filling, and he’d tell them that in fact, there are plenty of fillings for today’s challenge. Ramsay explains that today’s challenge is going to be the Blind Taste Challenge, a major mainstay in Hell’s Kitchen, where he’s going to test each chefs’ palate. In her confessional, Kara says she’s been bracing for this challenge since the beginning, and she’s ready to show everyone what she can do. Ramsay would present the chefs the table, the equipment each taster will wear, and then the two chairs by the pirate setup. He explains that this challenge will be different compared to Blind Taste Tests from the past; Ramsay will have one chef from both teams take a turn to taste what he will feed them, and if they guess the most right, they get a point. Guess wrong, and the partner sitting in the hot seat will be dunked with pie filling, also adding that he’s provided safety goggles for the partners being dunked. Unlike last instances, where someone starts getting dunked after their partner gets more than one wrong answer, they’ll be dunked after every wrong answer, starting with the first one; a little tradeoff, and honestly, judging after the last service, he kind of wants to put them all up to a test. Tem says in her confessional that it’s going to be a big mess that the losing team will have to clean up, assuming it’s the punishment one of them will have to work on for today, before backtracking and stating she hopes they don’t lose this challenge.

\-----

Round One began for the Blind Taste Challenge, and Ramsay called forward Sierra and Ruben to the hot seats, while Freddie and Allison were up first to taste. In his confessional, Ruben grumbles in his confessional that he knew he was going to get the hot seat first, and he prays that Allison doesn’t fuck it up, or they’ll be having a ‘serious discussion’ after the challenge. But in her own confessional, Allison states she’s confident she’s going to get them all right; after all, her palate is what made her get an A+ in the culinary studies. The first food Ramsay feeds them is broccoli. He asks them what they taste, and Allison guesses it right. Turning to Freddie, Ramsay gets the same answer from him, earning them a correct point. Both Sierra and Ruben breathe a sigh of relief, with Sierra stating in her confessional that it can be anyone’s game if it were between the two of them, but she could do it much better; she’d get all four correct. The next food Ramsay had them try was tomato sauce, and while Allison manages to get it right based on tasting the texture, it was a bit tough for Freddie, as he says in his confessional that he knows it’s tomato, and it either must be tomato sauce or… tomato bisque, which is what Freddie guessed, much to Sierra’s dismay, as Ramsay would inform him the correct answer. With that, James dunked a tin of pie filling onto the poor Blue Team member, causing Sierra to flinch from the sticky situation she had just been dunked on. Ramsay would look over and ask her what she had been dunked with, and Sierra confirms it was blueberry, to which James up above confirms it was. Sierra says in her confessional that all she can feel is the blueberry a la mode she was going to be blended into, while Freddie made his own confessional of how he should’ve known that was tomato sauce, admitting that bisque just slipped his mind. Ramsay gave them their next food to try; pineapple, and he tells both teams hopefully this would be the palate cleanser for both of them. Both Allison and Freddie would guess pineapple right, and Dani says in her confessional that she’s just hoping Allison would fail this next round so that they can tie, and they’ll take it. However, not everything sounded what it seems, as Ramsay would give them beetroot, and Allison guessed that answer correctly. As for Freddie, he hesitated a bit, before ultimately going with beetroot, getting it correctly. Upon taking the blindfolds and the headphones off, Allison finds Ruben squeaky clean, while Freddie chuckles and facepalms to find Sierra covered in blueberries. In his confessional, Ruben states that of course he’s clean as a whistle; nothing bad should happen to the Red Team at this rate.

Next up were Dani vs. Isabela, and as Freddie and Allison took the seats, the two ladies were put on their blindfolds and headphones by Ramsay. Dani said in her confessional that part of being in a chef that’s predominantly foodie is that they have an identity of what they can taste, so she can always rely on her palate to get to greater heights. Isabela says in her own confessional that she’s tasted plenty of ingredients back at her culinary academy, sure enough she can march through this competition without anything holding her back. Ramsay would first feed them blood sausage, which both ladies recoiled after tasting it, much to the amusement of everyone else, all of them laughing, including Marino and the sous chefs. The silver lining for both of them was that they both guessed it correct, leaving Freddie and Allison dry, for now. The next thing they would taste was ground fennel. Dani managed to guess correctly, but Isabela would guess ginger, earning Dani a point ahead of her. When Ramsay informed her the wrong answer, Isabela shook her head in her confessional, telling herself that was a bad idea. Meanwhile, Allison would be drenched by Michelle chocolate cream filling, and in her confessional, Allison says that she doesn’t mind chocolate, but right now, Isabela owes her. The next ingredient Ramsay had the two ladies try were carrots, with the Brit stating that this is an easy one. However, Dani guesses yam, earning more laughter from everyone else. Isabela wasn’t any different, as she guessed parsnip. Upon Ramsay telling both ladies the correct answer, Isabela apologized to Allison, but Allison closed her eyes as she was drenched with lemon meringue pie. As for Freddie, James doused him in a pink pie filling, and when Freddie tasted it, he said it doesn’t taste like strawberry. James would clarify that it's pink lemonade filling, with a little hint of chiffon. In his confessional, Freddie says that all this pie stuff is making him yearn to make some of these when he gets home. For their final round, Ramsay reminds the Red Team that if Dani gets this question wrong, both teams earn a point. He feeds the two ladies mango, and to everyone’s surprise, both of them get the point, but because Dani scored a point more than Isabela, the Blue Team gets the point overall, putting the score up 1-1. When Isabela turns and spots Allison drenched in a chocolate/lemon disaster, Allison tells her she better hope that she doesn’t get doused in pie filling like she has, and following it up in her confessional, she says Isabela’s many things, but having a palate isn’t one of them; she expected better from a culinary instructor, but then again, she’s not sure if she’s worked in legit restaurants or not. 

Following that round, Tem and Shayna were up next to taste, while Dani and Isabela took it to the hot seats. In her confessional, Shayna says that it feels weird wearing blindfolds and noise-canceling headphones, comparing them to being in Mardi Gras during the dark. Ramsay began feeding them their first ingredients; cabbage. Shayna would guess correctly, while Tem would guess… brussels sprouts. Upon being told that she was wrong, Tem muttered in her confessional that cabbage and brussels sprouts are sort of similar, but she didn’t know what she was thinking. Because of this, Dani was drenched by James with apple pie filling, with the sous chef telling her that it’s a fall classic; the Italian chef just responded with a laugh. Next up was their next ingredient, and Ramsay fed the two ladies pickles; both of them got it correct, though Shayna says in her confessional she almost gagged from how sour they were. Though the Red Team was ahead by one in this round, Ramsay continued to feed them ingredients, feeding them both celery; to everyone’s shock (and humor), both guessed wrong, with both of them guessing lettuce. Ramsay informs them the correct answer, and James and Michelle prepare to dunk poor Dani and Isabela with more pie fillings. As they’re dunked, Ramsay turns and asks them what kinds of filling they were dumped on. Dani responds she tastes pumpkin pie, while Isabela says she can taste molasses, with Michelle confirming with her that it's Shoofly Pie. Isabela says in her confessional, all muddied up, that she doesn’t know if she can ever taste Shoofly Pie the same again, while Dani says in her own that she’s been turned into an autumn masterpiece disaster. Before Ramsay feeds them the final ingredient, he reminds the Blue Team that if Tem gets this point correct and Shayna gets it wrong, they both get a point, but if Shayna gets it right, she clinches for the Red Team this round. He would feed them squid; Tem would get it right, as would Shayna, giving them both a point, but the Red Team would clinch the round due to Shayna scoring a point higher than Tem. In her confessional, Shayna cheers that years of having a strong palate have paid off, and she’s going to keep on showing everyone. Tem sheepishly apologizes to Dani, and while Dani nods, Tem says in her confessional now she’s up to get dunked… She just hopes someone else on the Blue Team has a better palate. 

As Tem and Shayna made their way to the hotseats, David and Rio were up next, being worn blindfolds and headphones. In his confessional, David mutters he doesn’t have the best palate, but he hopes that Ramsay would select ingredients that he’d easily identify. Ramsay would feed them the first ingredient; avocado. Rio guesses it right off the bat, while David guesses… butter. Tem groaned and shook her head, asking in her confessional if David could tell the difference between butter and avocado. After Ramsay informs David the correct answer, James would douse Tem with Chess Pie filling, making Tem mutter to herself that it’s just one round; maybe he’ll work on it. The next round consisted of Ramsay feeding them turmeric, but neither of them got it right, with Rio guessing ginger, while David guessed… cumin. Sierra says in her confessional that David’s really in over his head, asking if this was the same guy that won the Burger challenge earlier this season. Ramsay informed both of them the wrong answer, and James and Michelle would douse the two ladies in the hotseat with pie fillings; Shayna with rhubarb, Tem with a chocolate cookie pie with gummy worms, to which Tem asked what the hell that was; James confirmed it was Dirt Pie, making Tem shudder how gross it was, while an oblivious Shayna laughed. In her confessional, she says that Tem’s getting all the good flavors of pie; she doesn’t mind rhubarb pie, but Dirt Pie and Chess Pie are two delicious desserts she loves to have on a rainy day. Ramsay fed the two men their next ingredient; sweet potato. Rio guessed it correctly, while David guessed… cinnamon-sugar apples, making mostly everyone laugh out loud. Tem was the only one who didn’t laugh, as she shuddered in her confessional that David’s testing her badly. Upon being told the wrong answer, David winced in his own confessional how badly he’s tanking it this round; he doesn’t know how Tem’s feeling right now, but he hopes she’s okay. However, when James dumped Shepherd’s Pie filling onto Tem, a disgusted and irate Tem would angrily lash out, screaming at David and calling him a ‘motherfucker inbred piece of shit’, shocking everyone (sans David and Rio, for obvious reasons). In her confessional, Shayna says that Tem just exploded, and now things have become awkward. A concerned Ramsay paused the challenge to ask Tem if she was okay, and after Tem took a few deep breaths, she told Ramsay she’s fine; she wants to finish this round. A bit unnerved, Ramsay understands, but tells her he won’t continue it if she’s upset, but Tem insists she wants to, apologizing. In her confessional, she says she’s embarrassed that she lashed out like that, but she also hates getting doused in pie filling because David has a shit palate. For the final ingredient, Ramsay fed them pork, and while Rio guessed it correctly, David guessed chicken, earning him a wrong answer and Tem’s glare from behind. Freddie said in his confessional he’s very worried; not because of potentially losing the challenge, but how he’s afraid Tem’s going to kick David’s ass after the challenge, and he can’t have that happen; not when they’ve had a shitty service last night. A grumbling Tem notices James up ahead preparing the pie filling to dump, as she tells him, “*Now rope me, baby!*”, already over herself. James hesitates for a second, before nodding and telling her she's the boss, dumping creamsicle pie filling on her. Upon taking the headphones and blindfolds off, Rio laughs at how messy Tem looked, while David sheepishly apologizes, only for Tem to bitterly remind him he’s up next as she walks back to their team. David shook his head in his confessional, embarrassed that Tem’s pissed at him, and he can only hope that the Red Team has a bad round next round, and the Blue Team can work their way back up.

The score was now 3-1 Red Team, and he tells both teams that if the Red Team takes the most points this next round, then they clinch the challenge. Kara optimistically says in her confessional she hopes to clinch it this round, while Samuel says in his own confessional that he’ll do the best he can, but he does hope to win it. Ramsay summoned the two forward, while David and Rio made their way to the hot seats. With their blindfolds/headphones on, the two made themselves ready, as David prayed in his confessional that Samuel can edge out Kara, and then they can come back through a tiebreaker. The first ingredient Ramsay has them taste is mustard seeds, to which Kara guesses it correctly, while Samuel incorrectly guesses poppyseeds. Upon being told he was wrong, Samuel sighs in his confessional that that threw him for a loop. With his incorrect answer, James poured peanut butter pie filling on David, and in his confessional, David says that he didn’t think the peanut butter would mess up his pompadour, but being covered in filling is going to haunt his dreams. Their next ingredient consisted of brown rice, and after tasting them, both Samuel and Kara would get it right. The third ingredient was papaya, and Samuel would guess it correctly, while Kara guessed… guava, much to everyone’s humorous disbelief. Upon being told the wrong answer, Kara cries out an apology to Rio, as he’s dumped cherry pie by Michelle. Ramsay reminds them that if Kara gets this next ingredient correct, the Red Team wins this round, and they win the overall challenge, with Rio, soaked in cherries, saying in his confessional he’s counting on her one-hundred percent. The final ingredient for the round was John Dory, and the Brit fed one piece to Samuel, who guessed correctly after a moment. Then he turns to Kara, a spoonful of Dory in his hand, and after Kara ingested it, she started to hesitate a bit. The Red Team were looking on with suspense, as Allison says in her confessional that Kara better know what kind of fish she’s got in her mouth. Kara thought about it as she continued chewing… until she opened her mouth and guessed…

John Dory! 

With that, the Red Team cheered, as Ramsay told her she got the correct answer, putting the score up to 4, and causing the Red Team to clinch the challenge!

**4**\-2 - **Red Team wins!**

As Kara and Samuel got their headphones and blindfolds off, they learned the results of the challenge, with Kara cheering as she managed to help win this challenge. Meanwhile, Samuel says in his own confessional that it was a good effort, but he’ll just have to use that as a means to work harder.

I feel sharp and energetic all day long.

I'm no longer inflamed at all.

I'm going to ride this as long as I can until I hit my goal weight.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Getting lunch or dinner or  coffee or something would be fun but does that sound like a date (no idea if shes straight, I'm ace but everyone assumes im lesbian lol)?

I forgot how easy it was to clean, calibrate, and push out a great shot.

I am happy I decided to put so many outlets and dedicated circuits in my coffee station, I got room for 1 more grinder. Hopefully I can find a second hand single dose flat burr grinder in the coming year.",9,1765425322.0,espresso,6,0.91,False

It's not easy living in a big city. I've only ever had to drive about 10 minutes, including stoplights, to get from one side of town to another. After graduating college, however, I found myself more compelled to move out of my mom's house. I can't keep living there. Not because I hate my mother or anything petty like that. No it's because I know I need to actually do something with my life. My father recently died from a random heart attack. He wasn't in stellar shape or anything, but he didn't have any problems either. He was only 44 and it shook our family. My mom still isn't the same. I feel guilty for wanting to go, but my aunt said that she'll take care of my mom for me while I'm away.



The town I grew up in is the kind where you either start a family and grow old then die or you get addicted to drugs and work at a factory. Those are your choices. Not being content with either, I decided to follow a passion of mine instead. Acting. 



Acting has always come natural to me. I find it fun to get fully enveloped into a character and fake emotions. This is especially easy for me recently because everyone wants to see me doing better after what happened to my father. I don't want to disappoint them. I don't know whether that's good or bad, but it is what it is. Now that doesn't sound the best, but I don't use my “acting ability” in any malicious way. I'm not some manipulative monster. But from a young age I have always had a great imagination. Some people assume I just mean imagination as in the normal sense. No this is something different. I mean I had imaginary friends as a kid. I was that kind of weirdo. I've also been good at creating elaborate lies to keep myself out of trouble. 



My enjoyment of acting comes from the times I heard the applause at the end of a show. Being able to make people believe that they were really there inside the play. When my family and friends stop by and congratulate me on my performance from that evening's show, it was always very gratifying. However, up to this point I have only been in small production plays. Sometimes the local theatre would even, maybe, pay you if you're lucky. 



With all of that being said I took my savings (which I had been accruing for a few years) and had just enough cash to get an apartment in the best part of town. When I say best part of town I mean the best part of town for me. There will be rats and noisy neighbors but at least I won't get stabbed going in and out of my building…hopefully.



At this point I should say that I don't have anything lined up just yet and I've really just been following leads and playing things by ear. I've been working part time at a convenience store, making just enough to get the double slice lunch deal at my new favorite pizza place. ‘Di-Martino’s ran by a guy named Alphonse Martino. Al had inherited the business from his father who inherited the business from his father. Or at least that's the story. Anyway it's like 4 bucks for two slices of pepperoni plus a pop. It's a deal you can't beat



The other good thing about Martinos, besides free Wi-Fi, is the bulletin board beside the counter. This is where people can display ads for local events, coupons for other small businesses, or even private job listings. Every time I come in I'll check the board in the slight chance an acting gig will appear one day. 



Nothing yet, but I'm not tired of this grocery gig yet so I'm also not too worried, but this city is starting to get to me. It might just be a matter of needing to adjust to the different environment, but I haven't been sleeping well at night. The sirens are constantly blaring at all hours of the night. On top of that I'm just feeling really lonely. I've been thinking about my father more and more…. Of course this is all to be expected when you move to a new town, but damn… I gotta get out and talk to more people than just Al. 



Well the grocery store started decorating for fall already. It's only mid August but we've already started receiving Halloween decorations for the store. Way too early if you ask me, but no one did ask me so it is what it is. It's dawning on me that I haven't told you about my store yet. Just like any convenience grocery store, the groceries are over priced and we're located on the corner of a brick building. The glass windows that let me see the sky while I'm working are all dirty from years of neglect. Not too dirty for there to be a sense of urgency to clean them, but certainly not clean. The fridge has been broken ever since I started. Apparently the heat was too much for the poor thing and she blew a fuse or whatever refrigerators do. This means two things. *1) All of our drinks are warm AND 2) Customers ask us if we know that all of our drinks are warm*. It's a mix of funny and annoying whenever anyone mentions it because it happens every shift without fail. Every day. 



After work that day, I went straight to my apartment. It's not much to look at. A dingy little place, with two rooms. My bathroom and bedroom/ living room/ kitchenette. but the novelty of living on my own is keeping my spirits high. 



Even though my room has its charm, the rest of the building is eerie. The lobby is cold in both temperature and aesthetic. The stone is almost white and the pillars give off a roman temple vibe. It looks like it used to be a higher end building in the 70s or something, but now it fills me with an odd sense of nostalgia in an uncomfortable way. Then there's the basement. The trash receptacle is located in the basement and I haven't bothered to go down yet. I saw the stairwell and it looked like something right out of a horror movie. One dangling light suspended at the bottom and an old wooden door with latches. Sadly, I had put off taking my trash down to the basement long enough. My room was starting to smell. I needed to get it over with because I was also getting flies. 



The only way I can describe the basement is that it is haunted. My vivid imagination tells me that there are demons hiding in the dark behind the support beams. I decided to take the elevator rather than the stairs to speed up the process. Plus the elevator felt like a safe haven. I didn’t want to feel any more exposed than need be. The elevator was one of those old timey iron barred, cage elevators. The whole thing creaks and shakes when in operation. I started my journey to the bottom dreading my destination more and more with each and every shake of the metal contraption around me. When I got to the bottom floor, I noticed the entire basement was quiet. Not in a peaceful way however. The automatic lights hadn’t kicked on and the creaking of the rusted metal doors echoed throughout the room. I'm not superstitious usually, but the fact that I couldn't see anything terrified me. “It's just the trash room, lets get this over with” I told myself trying not to be so afraid. One by one, the cold fluorescent lights switched on in a stark, yet dim, white glow. They were the kind of light that grew brighter as they remained on, but initially gave off very little light. As the lights slowly warmed up, I made my way to the dumpster in the back. Just then a light flickered on from across the room. I thought to myself “Something is in the room with me.”



The situation didn’t seem like it could get worse until I was startled by the terrible shrieking sound of metal scraping against itself. I turned back in a startled panic. My only sense of safety was being whisked away. “The elevator must've been called to another floor.” I was scared, but was still determined not to run away. I couldn’t see anything in the room with me and by this point the room was fairly well lit. I looked around the dead silent cement crypt and cautiously made my way to the dumpster. When I flipped the lid open I stopped to quickly check my surroundings. The feeling of being watched made the hair on my neck and arms rise. Again I saw nothing and I chuckled to myself. I was scared for nothing. Just then a dark figure jumped  out at me from the darkness. I jumped out of its way with a shout. The dark figure was around the size of a rat… that's because it was a rat. This chunky fella was big enough to trip the motion lights. I swiftly threw my trash into the dumpster and ran away. He can have my trash for all I care. I'm just glad I wasn't mauled to death by some demon.



Back up in my room I've got 4 walls of cozy faded brick with just one window. The blinds are the cheap metal ones that bend too easily and let most of the sunlight in regardless if closed or not. I have resorted to tossing a blanket over the window to keep the light out; at least until I can afford to buy some curtains. I spent most of my time that night watching movies (for research purposes) and texting friends and family. It's mostly just people asking me how I feel about my father's passing and all… I know that they mean well, but it feels like they just want to hear that I'm doing poorly in the city on my own. I know it sounds a little pessimistic, but I feel like they don't really care when they ask me how I'm doing or how I feel. I can't explain why. Shit I'm cranky I just need to go to bed.



I've started making some friends here, finally. It felt like it took me forever to open up to them. This morning I got coffee with a few people from the store before work started at a coffee shop/diner. I'm not normally one for coffee because it makes me have to shit and then I feel jittery afterwards. This is just a part of my supreme acting prowess, fitting in. My shift Lead William is cool. He apparently graduated college when I did and is just working here while he looks for something in his field. He wants to work with animals, which is cool. I don't know why he lives here if he's looking for an animal job though. That is unless he plans on doing animal control or taking care of the mutant rats in my basement. I try not to press him on it though. If he's anything like me, he is already stressed enough about his career. He doesn't need me bringing it up. My other coworker, Shay, is a girl who swears college is for losers. Sadly, me and Will aren't really doing anything to prove her wrong. She likes to smoke weed and watch YouTube and if I'm being honest that's about all I know about her so far. I can tell that I like these guys and that this kind of friend group is just what I've needed. I haven't told them about my father because I really don't need anymore awkward conversations about him.



This afternoon, at lunch, I was getting my pizza when I noticed that there was an audition for a play on the board. This is just some school group doing a play, but it would be my first time acting since I got here. Needless to say I called and left a voicemail. I doubt I'll get turned down, they seemed somewhat desperate. The ad says that they only pay 50 dollars in total. This isn't a lot, but it means I can get something other than pizza finally. With that I knew I had to get back to work, I still had 4 hours left. It wasn't going to be a hard day at work, just long and soul draining. So I headed out from DI Martinos. I said goodbye to Al and started my two block trek back to the corner store.



Back at work I was dealing with customers when I noticed that it was already time to go home. “Holy shit. How did the time go by so fast?” 4 hours had flown by in what felt like a few minutes. I felt a little unnerved at first, but slowly saw this as a sign that the work had been monotonous and boring enough to just zone out. Besides, if I was just waiting for my call back from the play I wanted to be a part of, then what's the harm in flying through work?



A few days have passed and I still haven't heard anything from the community school play organizers. I'm probably just too excited for my own good. But I am worried I'll give it one more day before I call them again and ask about the role. I don't want to be too needy and have them be put off by my patheticness. Not that I think I'm pathetic, but that's how they would surely see it right ?



Work was a rough day today. I can't exactly remember what I hated so much about it, but I left in a worse mood than normal. It's not out of the ordinary to be miserable at work, but this was different. I feel like I'm in a fight or flight response mode and there's nothing to tie this feeling too. I think that tonight will be the first night I go to a bar after work. Hopefully that'll calm me down.



Drinking is a habit that I usually try to avoid. Back in college I wasted more money than I would like to admit on booze. Practically half of my paychecks (sometimes more) went to alcohol. It's safe to say that I had a drinking problem. I hated myself back then. I felt so fat and ashamed that eventually enough was enough and I broke the habit.



Anyway back to the bar, a little place tucked away called “Legends”. What was so legendary? Probably the cheap drink prices. It was the perfect mix between a dive bar and a college bar. Nothing too fancy, yet it was exactly what I needed tonight. I sat at a corner of the bar rail and ordered a beer. I wasn't trying to go too crazy tonight so a beer or two later and then I'll be gone. Or at least that's what I told myself when I first got here. After my second drink a familiar voice shouted from behind me. “Oh my God, Tyler what are you doing here?” the Shrill tone of Shay's voice rang out over the music that was playing. I turned around to see my coworker Shay somewhere between buzzed and completely fucking shit-faced. This was a shock to me as she was not yet 21 years old, only like 19 or 20. As she was introducing me to her friends I was too busy thinking about the implications of getting a fake ID and not going to college. “Damn she's dedicated” I thought to myself before snapping back to reality. “Wait, what did you just say?” I asked her as something had caught my attention. “I can't believe you went off on my customer like that, she like totally deserved it, but still I didn't know you had that in you.” she said in what seemed like a genuine impressed manner. I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about at first. But the more and more I thought about it I was starting to get glimpses of a memory from work this afternoon. A customer demanded to have a price on an item changed to the price of an item nearby. Customers try to pull this shtick all the time and it's my job to check the listed price tags and break the bad news that I can't give them things for cheaper even though they asked really nicely. I remember that, today, this customer claimed I was trying to scam her by not giving her the listed price and no matter how many times I told her that she was mistaken and I showed her the price tags. She insisted I was, in fact, the one in the wrong. Usually this doesn't bother me because I know these people are either broke or stupid. I wouldn’t feel like picking an argument with somebody like this. It struck a nerve, however, when she called me ‘an incompetent dumbass’. I can't repeat what I said to the customer but just know that there were a few cuss words and insults thrown her way. “Oh shit I might actually get fired for this, how can I be so careless and emotional like that” I thought to myself in a nervous panic. No wonder I was on edge all day. How can I forget something like this? My mind was a whirlwind and it started to become nauseating as I was thinking about all the implications of getting fired. Just then I was alerted to my surroundings. I was at a bar with a coworker and her friends. I wasn't going to spoil my mood worrying about some stupid job I don't even want, besides I'll get that call tomorrow from the community school play and I'll get the ball rolling on working into bigger and better productions. 



Previously I had mentioned that I drank a lot in college, but after toning it down, my tolerance is nowhere near what it once was. After about four drinks she and her friends decided to do a round of tequila shots. This is what sent me over the edge. I say this because that's one of the last things I remember before waking up in my bedroom with a blistering headache at 3:30 a.m. “Jesus Christ I need water” I thought to myself. My mouth was so dry it felt like it was bleeding. My hangover felt like somebody had taken a hatchet and started chopping my skull. Visions played of me Shay and her friends dancing to some music that I reluctantly paid for. There were about five of us dancing. After enough time some onlookers joined in after seeing how drunkenly enthusiastic we were. It was great. Sure I was paying for it now, but it was worth the pain and suffering. “Fuck I really need to get a Poweraid.” I drunkenly began sliding on my slippers to make a quick walk to the nearest store that was still open. I found a 24/7 convenience store (not the one I work at). The streets are never really dead in this town, but they do quiet down at night. I got about 3 minutes from my apartment before I realized that it wasn’t safe to be going around at night like this. I immediately tensed up and began looking all around. I didn’t see anyone, but I didn’t feel safe. I picked up my pace. When I got to the store I grabbed the biggest, bluest Powerade I could find in the cooler and made my way to the counter to pay. The poor guy behind the counter looked just as rough as you'd expect. Through the window of the front of the store, I noticed a shadowy figure slip into the alley way behind a dumpster right beside the path I had walked to get here. Even in my half drunk stupor I could tell that it wasn’t a bright idea to get near that alleyway. When I left the store I decided to take an alternate route. Feeling less and less safe, I walked faster to my building. When I entered my lobby I turned towards the street to see if I was being crazy or not. Right outside my lobby window I saw a figure slip out of sight. Thank god for key cards, but that was too close for comfort. I can’t be that careless again. 



I came to the next morning with an empty powerade bottle sitting next to me on my nightstand and slightly more tolerable hangover. At least I wasn't drunk anymore. I desperately needed food though. I felt like the liquor was digesting my own stomach. I wanted something to calm it down. So I went to the coffee shop like usual and met Will and Shay. I was somewhat surprised that Shay looked completely fine. I on the other hand had looked like I barely slept and I felt just as awful as I looked. “Damn Tyler, you have a lil too much fun last night?” Will asked me teasingly. I smiled because he was 100% correct. I did have too much fun. I wasn't going to try and lie about it, especially because Shay was right there. She looked like a shaken up can of pop, ready to explode with excitement. “Oh my God I had no idea that Tyler could dance did you?” Blah blah blah. We had a great conversation and I informed them of my potential mugging that night. They agreed that it seemed like a sketchy situation. After having my much needed recovery meal, I had some caffeine to wake me up. I was going to need it in order to get through today's shift at the convenience store. 



On the walk to work, after the coffee shop, my phone started buzzing, indicating that I was receiving a call. I drew it out of my pocket quicker than a cowboy in a gunfight. I answered “Hello this is Tyler Mendez."" My voice trembled with delight knowing that I was finally going to get my role. “HI Tyler, this is Abigail from the community school theatre group. I wanted to reach out to you about our production that you applied for.” I was so eager for her to hurry up I remember thinking “c’mon just say it already.“ she continued “ well unfortunately all of our slots have already been fulfilled with returning members. I still wanted to reach out so you didn't get left wondering.”.... I was silent for what felt like too long and I could tell Abigail thought so too. “Hello Tyler?” Choking back tears I replied “oh yeah sorry I'm just taking that in, thank you for informing me. Keep me in consideration for any upcoming roles.” I blurted it out sloppily. I hung up just as abruptly. The jovial mood I had this morning died. It no longer felt quite as beautiful out as it had before and I was ready to go home. I could tell Will and Shay were both staring at me wanting to reassure me that everything was going to be fine. I said nothing and continued our walk to the convenience store in silence. 



That day was another shitty day and I couldn't bring myself to be my cheerful self. I was quiet and withdrawn from all social interactions. Nothing notable happened at work that day other than my mom calling me toward the end of my shift. I saw the caller ID display ‘MOM’. I knew she would ask me how the job search was going and if I had gotten the role I told her about. I didn't want to be an even bigger disappointment so I decided that I would just call her back when I had it in me to do so. I ended my shift and walked home. I didn't want to go to the bar again, but I needed a drink. 



The summer was coming to an end and the leaves were changing colors. The air was finally starting to turn crisp and cool. In the evening, the air was just warm enough to be comfortable. No longer so humid that one would instantly sweat. I walked to the liquor store after work and picked up a twelve pack to drink. I know burying my sorrows in alcohol isn't healthy, but this is only temporary and I know that I can quit. Or at least that's what I was telling myself. Around 8 that evening, after a few drinks, I decided it was finally time to call my mother. I rang her a few times and it went to voicemail. “Ahhh crap she probably hit the hay early tonight. I'll just call her back tomorrow” I told myself as I put on a video and relaxed on my couch. I was still in the mood to talk to someone however, so I texted the group chat with me, Will, and Shay. I'm pretty sure Shay was stoned because when she is, she really likes to send us cat memes. She was absolutely blowing up the group chat at that moment and I hate to admit that they were making me feel better about my predicament. I felt so dumb for crying over a stupid school play. I would have absolutely regretted signing up for something like that if I had got the role. After some chit chatting, I decided that I should get some sleep. 

  
That next morning felt off in a way I can't explain. Maybe drinking two days in a row was affecting my mood. Maybe the different weather was changing more than just the color of the leaves. We were getting weather that was rainy and gray. I told myself that seasonal depression is a bitch, but at least this means I can finally break out my bulky sweaters. I got some slight enjoyment unpacking my autumnal attire, but still I felt like something was off. I got a call from my aunt. “SHIT, I forgot to call my mom back” I thought to myself. I hurriedly answered the phone and instantly apologized “Hey Jenny, sorry I didn't answer the phone yesterday I was busy with work and forgot to reply”... She remained silent. I heard some hushed whimpers and choppy breathing as if my aunt was trying to muster up the energy to say something. My stomach instantly churned and my body went numb head to toe. “Jenny? What's wrong?” She started bawling “I'm so sorry Tyler, I wasn't there when she needed me yesterday. I went to dinner with my friends and left her alone. I had no idea….” I cut her off before she could finish. “Jenny what do you mean? what happened?” … “Tyler… she hung herself… your mother’s gone.”

I know this sounds stupid but I seriously dont know how to go about this. We are both very anxious people but we get along really well. We have talked about hanging out socially but neither have actually invited to other to do anything. I haven't really had a friend since I was a kid, what do adults do with thier friends? 

We both live with our parents and I have a big family so something outside the house would be ideal. Our main shared interest is dance (we are both dance instructors) so that doesn't leave much as far as social activities. We have talked about power point parties and both agree that it would be fun, but again, would rather not invite her over to my house.

Getting lunch or dinner or  coffee or something would be fun but does that sound like a date (no idea if shes straight, I'm ace but everyone assumes im lesbian lol)?

I just passed the FE Other Disciplines and wanted to share what helped me, especially for anyone who has been out of school for a while or feels overwhelmed. This was my second attempt. The first time, I studied for 6 months and still didn’t pass. This time I studied for about 1 to 2 months, around 2 to 3 hours a day on weekdays, and honestly nothing on weekends. I retain info better when it’s closer to the exam date. Might be the ADHD procrastinator side of me haha. I took the second take a year or so after the first try.

For context, I’ve been out of school for 10 years, I have a family and kids, and my job isn’t even related to engineering anymore. If I can pass this thing, you definitely can too.

Here are the things that actually helped me pass:

# Tips

* Skip the hard questions first. Flag them and move on. Do not get stuck early because your confidence will tank fast.
* If you have extra time, double or even triple check your answers. Don’t get too overconfident. This was my mistake in my first attempt.
* If you’ve been out of school a long time, study the concept first before jumping into problem sets. Understanding the core idea made everything click for me. There are tons of YouTube videos and free courses on Coursera that explain topics clearly.
* Use ChatGPT. If you have ChatGPT Plus, try the GPT called “[FE Exam Study Guide](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Jv0wmQVN5-fe-exam-study-guide).” It helped me a lot. It is not always perfect, but it is very useful. I uploaded my calculator manual, my FE reference PDFs, my scores from each practice exam, and even the question/solution PDFs so it knew what areas I was good at and which ones I needed to focus on. It helped me build a study plan. I used Google Gemini to double check hard ones too.
* I used the four exams from the “How to Pass on Your First Try” book and after each one I told ChatGPT my score so it could track my weak areas. For me the weak spots were civil engineering topics because I graduated in electrical engineering.
* Get a good night’s sleep before the exam, drink coffee or eat before, and bring snacks for your break.
* Get to the testing center early so you’re not panicking or rushing if you forget something.
* Not everything is multiple choice. There are fill in the blank questions too.
* Study the psychrometric chart for thermodynamics. It shows up.
* Wear comfy clothes. Test centers can get cold.

I was and still am happy to be living away from home, and so far have liked living here. The main issue I've found is that I've struggled to make friends. When I was living at home as a kid and during college I was always around others and built friendships that way, then I got to meet a bunch more people through them. I don't have any friends or know anyone outside of work here, so I'm kinda lost on how to make friends here.

The team I work closely with have their own families and kids and don't really have a lot of time or energy/willingness to spend a lot of time outside of work. We've gone out for drinks/coffee after work or during breaks, but that's been rare. I go to the gym pretty much every day, but I never know when it is/isn't appropriate to start up conversations with others since everyone's focused on their own workouts. I've gone out to local bars a few times, but mostly with friends when they visit from back home. I feel pretty weird about going to bars and drinking alone, so I've been avoiding that.

For those of you who have moved away from home to brand new places, how did you meet new people and make new friends? I'd love to hear some recommendations.",1,1765425030.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

I previously had a Sonos Beam on top a coffee table I was using as a media console. This Black Friday I finally decided to upgrade the whole situation got a Herman Miller console and I wanted to get a turntable too I was looking at turntables that had Bluetooth so I could use my existing Sonos sound bar just because of space. After quite a bit of research I came across the new KEF Coda W which would allow me to directly plug a turntable into then plus it has HDMI ARC so I could use it with my tv too and get rid of my Sonos Beam. 

So I jumped on it and everything turned out great, I got much better speakers for my tv especially for dialog. I can hear people speak so much more clearly and I also could spend more money on a turntable with better components because the KEFs have a built in phono pre amp. And to top it all off they came in matching colors. The only downsides so far are they are actually speakers and my neighbors that I live next door to for 5 years came over and said my music was too loud for the first time ever and the KEF app is atrocious like unacceptably bad and buggy for a company that sells $30,000 speakers.  

I moved the speakers further from the wall and I might get foam plugs for the rear ports on the back of the speakers. I also and probably going to cut the entire wall open to move the outlets down. Any recommendations as to what materials I could put in the wall while it’s open to deaden the sound. ",15,1765424817.0,turntables,14,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to date/hookup since I moved to the US during my freshman year of college. Long story short I’ve had no success other than 1 relationship that lasted 3 months and ended with her cheating on me. This all came to a boiling point when I asked a girl I’d been working with in my class if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. Her response: “You’re a cool guy but I could never go out with someone speaking one of those monkey languages” (paraphrasing). For the record, I am fluent in English and don’t have an accent (technically I have a midwestern accent but most Americans I know tell me I have no accent), the only reason she knew I was a foreigner was because she overheard me talking to my mother in my native tongue on the phone and asked me about it.

I have a pretty good friend group, with most of them being in relationships and bringing their partners to hangouts (which I don’t mind at all, it makes things more fun). The problem arises with any sort of PDA or other “couple activities” (for lack of a better word). While I try not to let these things get to me, it always hurts seeing people experiencing something I crave so much, but it hurts even more knowing these are my friends and I shouldn’t feel this way, and in the end I just end up feeling like a lonely asshole coveting what other people have. Lack of intimacy has also left me pretty touch starved and frustrated, which is becoming a distraction that I don’t want to have to deal with.

My question is, how did you guys get over these feelings and urges? Even a temporary fix would work as I would like to get back into the scene after I finish school.

I have talked to some close friends about this and many have suggested either a massage or seeing an escort. My problem with this is that paying for physical contact/sex has always grossed me out, it’s always been about the intimacy and emotional connection for me, so paying for this kind of thing isn’t really something I want to consider.

1pjnixi,https://www.reddit.com/r/papermario/comments/1pjnixi/origami_king_gave_me_a_rewlnewed_love_for_the/,Origami King gave me a rewlnewed love for the Paper Mario series (I rate it 6.5/7?),"I'm bad at rating games, but in my personal opinion, if I had to rate the first three titles of the Paper Mario series, I would put them somewhere between the range of 8 and 10. This game falls a little under that for obvious reasons. 

Firstly, I loved the art-style. I really enjoyed every aspect this game had to offer, every single visual, every world/area/chapter. The hidden coffee houses and the scenes with Mario and Olivia, really made me feel like an adventurer taking a break after a long Trek. 

The lack of original characters, I'll admit, had me very worried about the potential of this game, but with the limited amount of characters we got, I genuinely enjoyed every interaction. I thought Bobby was a good character, and it shocked me when he was just suddenly not a part of the story. And then we got people like professor Toad to enter the story, and fill a void. I enjoyed this --ive always wanted a Toad party member. I noticed that the theme with this game would be temporary partners, not something we were used to. When we got to the Shangri-Spa, and Kamek was introduced...I fell in love with this game. I already enjoyed it, but the characterization of both Kamek and Jr., as well as the reveal that Kamek would participate in battles...oh my, what a twist! And they kept bringing up Bobby more towards the end, reminding you of the partner you only knew for a while...he did make an impact for sure.

The battling...hm. in the end, I grew to kind of like, or at least, not mind the battles. The battles with normal enemies went by relatively quickly, especially when I unlocked better weapons down the road. The bosses... Were really hard to figure out. It makes me wonder how in the world Nintendo thinks that this could possibly be marketed as a kids game.. I'm trying to remember what I was like playing video games as a kid, but I don't think I would have ever grasp this if this came out back then, and I would have put the game down. 

However, the bosses were memorable, some of the themes and gimmicks were actually pretty fun, and I ended up really enjoying each of the bosses despite having to look up a walk-through on YouTube at one point or another when I couldn't figure out a certain puzzle that had to do with that spinny wheel thing. Other parts-- like trying to 100 percent Shy Guys Finish Last, felt impossible. After spending an entire two days and not even making it to the last three challenges, made me really resent having to move on with the story. I wanted to beat this game in one fell swoop, but this one hurdle made me want to either put this game down entirely, or just finish with the story, slightly disappointed. I'm a completionist.

I really enjoyed finding the the holes and filling them with confetti, but the treasures, blocks, and Toads did stump me a bit. Even looking at videos had me wondering where I missed one, I just felt dumb. But....it was fun. Seeing the stars appear and confirm each area was completed was a nice touch, and reminds me how harder it was to manage what was missed and what wasn't, back in the older games.

I like the fact that a death meant actually restarting from the save block--as easy as this game became eventually, there needed to be some kind of challenge. I did die a few times, and was absolutely stunned when I realized I had to repeat a bunch of segments because I forgot to save. I miss that aspect of gaming a little, instead of having infite lives and continues, and being able to resume just from the start of a fight, like the TTYD Remake. 

My favorite part of this game was the Legion of Stationary, because of their varying personalities and roles, and what they did...was kind of terrifying. For a child--im not one, so I can't speak as one anymore--it seems like it would be traumatizing, no? Getting hole-punched. Stapled into an origami form that can't do much. Scizzored into oblivion. Not to mention the opening sequence alone--it checked all the boxes in what I want for a ""dark Mario game"". Games like Partners in Time, enemies like Reclusa, demons like the Shadow Queen and twisted villains like Dimentia, is something I love about this series. While I wasn't a fan of Olly, I thought the legion of stationary did well to make their presence THREATENING. And as you get closer to them you see more signs of the chaos theyve caused.

My rating for this game would be higher....except I hated the final boss. I needed a walkthrough to help me with Ollys Ice Vellumental phase, and even then, I was frustrated and just kept spinning the wheels for a couple of hours until I figured out how to finally click the ON button and get on the HANDS symbol on the same phase. It was kinda fun bashing the ground as Origami Bowser went at it with Olly...but other than that I can't say this was memorable. Because of my ADHD I looked up the solution to the final puzzle immediately, because I just had an inkling that I would die. I still was a little close to death, 20 or 30 health out of 200 remaining, but I did it. 

This game was amazing, but the final boss lowered my opinion of it again. Ollys motivation was really poor, and kind of treats the Toad-fetch questing as a joke...and I was actually ENJOYING the Toad aspect! Finally, after years of judging how this series turned out, I gave it a shot enjoyed the Toads...and Ollys hatred of paper flat Toads is the reason he did all of this? I guess it's a Mario game...the secret legendary creature of TTYD was a dried mushroom...but really? After all the twists and turns this game gave us, Olly had absolutely nothing going for him, and that's a shame, because other than the different battle style and Ollys characterization, I'd say this would be a perfect game.

Yesterday I woke up already exhausted, which was impressive because I went to sleep exhausted. I dragged myself out of bed, stepped directly onto the one charger I definitely didn’t leave on the floor, and then realized my coffee machine had apparently joined a union and refused to work until “conditions improved.”

Fine. Whatever. I went to work caffeine-free, vibrating like a dehydrated chihuahua. On the way, a bird pooped on my shoulder. Not even a small bird. A big bird. A bird that had clearly eaten something unholy. I’m pretty sure I got targeted.

Then, halfway through my shift, I found out my hours are being cut again, which is hilarious since my bank account is already on life support and needs the financial equivalent of CPR. Like, I’m pretty sure the last time I checked, the balance coughed.

But the real chef’s kiss? After work, I stopped at the grocery store to buy the absolute essentials—ramen, generic cereal, and the cheapest bread that technically qualifies as bread. The total came to more than I had. I tried to laugh it off, but apparently my debit card didn’t get the joke and declined so loudly that even the self-checkout robot judged me.

I left with nothing but my pride, which, frankly, was the cheapest thing in the cart anyway.

Sat in my car afterward and had the kind of breakdown where you cry, laugh, and consider starting a GoFundMe titled “Help Me, I’m Tired.”

Like many of you, I use IPTV services, but I’ve always been frustrated with the iOS apps available. The free ones are usually slow, look outdated, or make it impossible to find the specific sporting event I want to watch amid thousands of channels. The paid ones force you to pay a subscription which is the bane of my existence

So, I decided to build Nebulo.

I wanted something that felt like a modern, native iOS app—buttery smooth with a clean design. A lot of the design choices came from Apple's sports app and all buttons are native ""glassy effect"" iOS buttons.

Cool features:

* The ""Sports Center"" (probably need a new name)**:** This is the main feature. It pulls in real-time scores for major leagues (NFL, NBA, Premier League, etc.). If you see a game is live, just tap the scorecard, and the app intelligently searches your playlist and plays the correct channel instantly. No more guessing which BeIN Sports or ESPN channel has the match.
* Optimized: I spent a lot of time optimizing the scrolling and video playing. There are no stuttering or ugly grey loading bars, even with massive playlists. It uses full-resolution icons with smart caching so it doesn't eat your RAM.
* Apple UI: Glassmorphism design with adjustable nebula background. It just looks nice and is customizable.

How to download: I’m releasing it as a ""pay what you want"" download. You can grab it for free if you want, or toss a coffee my way if you like it.

*(Disclaimer: This is just a player. It does not contain any channels, playlists, or content. You must use your own legal provider.)*

I’d love to hear your feedback on the sports integration! I know there are likely many bugs so please dm me with any problems that you will inevitably find. I am looking for a better way to organize these eventual bugs. First time creating an app in progress so if anyone has experience let me know.",3,1765424245.0,TTVreborn,14,1.0,False

My golden rule is don't commit to dinner on the 1sr date,  but I got roped in to dinner with a CRAZY 1! As she got drunk, This woman claimed to be a psychic, and talked for a hour about a man she went out with once who she thinks is a terrorist,  but she's in love with with him. I finally interrupted her and said, hey, you want to split some fajitas, and she said sure. 2hrs after sitting down listening to her talk about being a psychic superpower in love with a terrorist I pay for the bill. Mind you, I'm sober because i'm in recovery and she's LIT! Neither one of us actually had a car and she was staying at an extended stay about .5 mile behind the restaurant. I lost her over there because she couldn't stand up straight.And then I got the hell out of there. Kindly denying her offers to come up to the room and be offere A ""rape"" charge. No way in hell would I go up there with her in that condition after that dinner.

The next morning at 5am I get a long text about how she didn't get this

✍️I couldnt believe you had the audacity to want to date me. Everything that happened was wrong. I couldn't even order what I wanted it was unacceptable. Of course I would date a terrorist that was atrocious I didn't even get enough to eat. I didn't even like dinner  Talking about buying cologne when you can't even pay for a proper date. How gross! 

So I responded..
✍️I actually just have the audacity just want to get laid, even though in person you really don't look like your pictures at all. I could never date you. I told my roommate before I went that I have a feel in this girl is is catfishing me and way bigger than the picture she sent me... Women are masters of photo filters or just sending old pictures. Boy was I right!! 

Of course you didn't get enough to eat... but that's not my fault! 

After an hour of hearing your bullshit what about your psychic scams and other men, I just mentioned Let's get fajitas to try and speed that shit up!! 

Here's a transcript of a VM I got today after responding in kind to her early morning text!
✍️Have you lost your mind? I have always lived in nice apartment complexes. I just choose to travel if I don't get involved with my terrorist in his home. He cultured me. He didn't. You were just so ignorant. That's ridiculous. And what makes you think you can speak to me that way? I'll walk around here because I'm not a danger or somebody that is affiliated with bad things like yourself. You're the person with a past. You're the person that's useless. You're the person that works at a restaurant at, like, 45 years old. How dare you even speak to me that that way? You need to to kill yourself for something. I am not psycho. I just know how to treat pieces of shit like you. How dare you? I have no past, no nothing. I just am entitled because I know I'm above just bove everybody here in Memphis, including you. Thank you.

I brewed 140 g of beans coarsely ground alongside 20 oz of Brita filtered water and let it steep for 24 hours on the counter. This yielded a hair under 12 oz of concentrate which I diluted with 2 parts water and 1 part cream for a satisfying result

  
However, my second yield I tried some more beans (180 g, coarsely ground) with a roughly equivalent 4:1 water ratio (24 oz). Steeped for 25 hours in the fridge. This time, the grounds roughly reached the mark on the side of the container indicating the max coffee allowance and the water pretty much reached to the top near the rainmaker. But this yielded me a paltry \~10 oz of concentrate.

  
What gives? Should I be using an additional paper filter? Are my grounds not coarse enough? My beans were ground on the coarsest setting that my Kidisle burr grinder allows, since I read that fine grounds can result in this very problem.

  
Anyways. TL;DR not a lot of concentrate for an entire bag of beans. Any and all tips appreciated.",1,1765424143.0,coldbrew,1,1.0,False

After I dropped her off, she texted me that ""it was fun hanging out. thanks for lunch and coffee."" When I got home after 20 minutes, I hearted her message and texted her back, ""I’m glad you had fun. Me too, let’s do it again soon. Coffee on me💀🤣"" soon after she thumbs up my message. Am I just tripping and overthinking or did she respond uninterested with the thumbs up. Mind y’all, we were both laughing and having a good time the whole time. so I’m certain that I’m overthinking it since it’s my first time hanging out with a girl that I like outside of work.

I know this sounds stupid but I seriously dont know how to go about this. We are both very anxious people but we get along really well. We have talked about hanging out socially but neither have actually invited to other to do anything. I haven't really had a friend since I was a kid, what do adults do with thier friends? 

We both live with our parents and I have a big family so something outside the house would be ideal. Our main shared interest is dance (we are both dance instructors) so that doesn't leave much as far as social activities. We have talked about power point parties and both agree that it would be fun, but again, would rather not invite her over to my house.

Getting lunch or dinner or  coffee or something would be fun but does that sound like a date (no idea if shes straight, I'm ace but everyone assumes im lesbian lol)?

Sorry again for the stupid question, im AuDHD and this kind of thing does not come naturally to me. All advice is welcome",1,1765423971.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

***

Morning slid in sideways through the mall lot, pale and nosy. Janna rolled the Subaru’s window two inches when Marco did the familiar knock. Frog key in her pocket; Holly loafed like a paperweight.

“Breakfast?” he asked.

“We literally did this yesterday,” she said.

“Yeah. Day two of a healthy habit.”

She sighed like agreeing to food was a moral failing. “Fine. But if this becomes a tradition, I’m starting a punch card that says ‘Buy 9, receive 1 (1) minor crime.’”

“Deal.”

They crossed to the diner again; same bell, same corner booth, different weather in their faces. Coffee arrived like a reliable friend, no questions asked.

“Thanks,” she said, simple, because gratitude counts as a language. She tore her pan de sal and stole half his hash browns like taxes.

“How’s the couch?” he asked.

“Doesn’t bite. House hums nice.” She flicked a glance at him. “Angie labeled the towels. That woman is terrifying in the way that heals you.”

“Yeah,” he said, soft. “She’s good like that.”

Janna nudged his shin under the table. “So. The Star situation.”

He made a face. “She texted. We’re… talking later.”

“Translation: You’re about to get chill-yelled.”

“I plan on being calm.”

“Good,” she said. “Keep it short. Do not monologue. And if you panic, picture a goat fainting.”

“You’re a menace.”

“Correct.”

The quiet that followed was comfortable. She ate. He let her. When they stood, she slipped the receipt from his hand and paid before he could flex numbers.

“Gremlin honor,” she said. “I’m not a charity case.”

“I know.”

“Good.”

***

Back in Bullseye’s stock room, Alfonzo and Ferguson were already mid-movie about it.

“Diaz returns from breakfast with Mystery Woman #1,” Ferguson narrated.

“Girlfriend,” Alfonzo corrected, clicking a box cutter with courtly gravitas.

“She’s not my—”

“Mhm,” they chorused.

Marco gave up and shouldered a tote. “I’m setting up a drawer. Towels. Toothbrush.”

“So she is your girlfriend,” Ferguson said, delighted.

“She is my friend,” Marco said, steady. “Who isn’t sleeping in a car anymore.”

Alfonzo’s grin softened. “Then you’re doing it right.”

***

Stardrops ran like a cheerful machine, and Star moved with it: pull, tamp, lock, steam, pour, smile. Through the glass she clocked them without meaning to. Marco’s hoodie. Janna’s beanie. A little GoodHome bag that said towels-and-a-lamp, not grand gestures. The sight made Star’s chest do that slippery elevator drop and she hated that it did.

Her phone buzzed.

> **Pony Head:** girl I’m standing by the koi fountain and I can third-party narrate if u want 🐴✨

> **Star:** absolutely do not

> **Pony Head:** say the word and I roll up in a trench coat w/ sunglasses and a tiny notepad

> **Star:** STOP

> **Pony Head:** ok but also… meet him after shift. Outside. Cold air = drama control. Kiss emoji, not for him, for ur inhaler 💋

Star bit back a laugh she didn’t want to have. She slid a latte across the bar like it hadn’t just saved her life.

***

Evening put teeth in the air. The concourse lights came on in rows; koi bubbled like gossip. Star texted: *Outside. Now.*

Marco met her under the overhang where the wind knifed around the corners. November chill. Their breath made little ghosts.

“Hey,” he said.

“Hey.” She hugged her elbows, too proud for a coat, too stubborn to shiver. “So. You and Janna.”

“She’s staying with my family,” he said. “Spare bedroom.”

“Right,” she said. “And you’re not… seeing her.”

“I’m helping her,” he said. “That’s the sentence.”

Star stared at the tile until it went blurry, then made her eyes behave. “I don’t care what you do for strangers, Marco. I care that I’m your person and I watched you hand a frog key to somebody else.”

His mouth twitched. “Mariposa handed her the frog key.”

“Don’t be cute.”

He nodded once, chastened. “I’m not picking teams. I’m picking a boundary.”

“You always say that like it’s neutral.” Her voice got sharp around the edges. She hated it and couldn’t stop it. “You broke up with me this morning and then—what—played house by lunch? Do you even hear how that sounds?”

“It sounds like I made sure someone didn’t sleep in a car,” he said, still calm. “It sounds like I’m not cutting off a friend to make another friend feel safer. That would be cruel.”

“Cruel,” she said, like she had to test the word’s weight. Wind pushed her bangs into her eyes; she didn’t flinch. “Okay. Then hear me clear: this hurts. It looks like a replacement even if it isn’t. I’m trying not to be awful about it.”

“I hear you,” he said. “And I’m not changing the plan.”

She nodded, once, too hard. “Then don’t lie to me later with ‘it’s complicated.’ It’s simple. You chose.”

“I chose to help,” he said. “And I chose to be honest with you.”

“Fine.” She swallowed. “Then be honest about one more thing. Do you like her?”

He looked away, down, anywhere, then back at her because that was who he was. “I… care about her,” he said. Simple, true, not an essay.

Star’s breath fogged; she watched it like it could answer for her. “Thanks for telling me,” she said, voice small and flat at once. “I’m going home.”

He didn’t reach for her. Good. If he had, she might’ve shattered.

“Text me when you get there?” he asked, still Marco, because he couldn’t not.

She almost said no just to be mean. “Fine.”

She left before the rest of her face told on her.

***

The Diaz house did its warm-house thing: soup steam, rosemary in a jar, Rafael muttering happily at a drawer. Janna sat on the couch in borrowed socks, frog key winking from its new hook. Holly supervised.

Angie appeared with a Pringles can like a fairy godmother who believed in salt. “For morale,” she said. “No pressure to share.”

“Finally,” Janna said. “A woman who understands me.” She popped the lid and the room laughed a little.

Her phone buzzed. Star.

Janna thumbed the fluorite once—*click, click*—and answered. “Yo, Sparkles. What’s up?”

“You at Marco’s house?” Star asked, voice too casual to be casual.

“Mmhm.”

“Is… Angie the one who invited you?” Star pushed. “I need the truth, Banana.”

“Angie and Rafael,” Janna said. “I said yes.”

“Okay.” Star took a breath that sounded like she wasn’t letting herself cry. “Okay.”

Janna leaned back, put her feet on the couch because Angie hadn’t told her not to. “You good?”

“No,” Star said, honest and too loud. She lowered her voice. “I asked him to stop seeing you. He said no.”

“Correct,” Janna said. “It was a good sentence.”

“Don’t do that,” Star snapped. “Don’t… coach me. You’re not my therapist. You’re my friend. Supposedly.”

“I am,” Janna said. “Also a gremlin. Multifaceted.”

“You’re also in his house,” Star said. “Which, like, would be fine if you weren’t—if he didn’t—ugh.” She pinched the bridge of her nose at herself. “Are you and Marco a thing?”

“We are not,” Janna said. “He’s a boundary boy.”

“You’re impossible,” Star said, but it came out helpless.

“Checks out.”

“Stop saying checks out!”

“The data keeps checking out.”

“Janna.” Star’s voice went thin. “I don’t want to lose you.”

“I don’t want to be lost,” Janna said, plain. “But I’m not leaving a safe bed because you’re scared.”

Silence stretched. In it, Janna could hear the house humming and Holly purring and the little device in her chest doing its quiet metronome. She rubbed behind her ear where Tala’s fingers had hurt and let the sting exist without naming it.

“I hate that you’re good at sounding calm,” Star said finally. “I hate it.”

“I learned how to hold still,” Janna said. “You learned how to burn bright. Both are real.”

Star sniffed. “I’m going to hang up before I say something I can’t take back.”

“Smart.”

“I’ll text tomorrow.”

“Afternoon,” Janna warned, deadpan. “I’m sleeping in like a feral raccoon that found soup.”

“Fine,” Star said, and a microscopic laugh slipped out against her will. “Goodnight, Banana.”

“Night, Sparkles.”

Janna ended the call and set the phone face down. Angie gave her a quiet little chin-tip from the kitchen that translated to *proud of you for not exploding*. Janna wiggled the chip can at her in salute and fed Holly a single, unseasoned flake because the queen demanded tribute.

***

Later, the house downshifted into lamp-light and slipper-sounds. Rafael installed the tiny brass hook by the door with a flourish. Mariposa ceremonially placed a second frog sticker on the frame “for luck, duh.”

Marco hovered in the living-room doorway with a folded hoodie. “In case you get cold,” he said.

“I will hoard this like a dragon,” she warned.

“Understood.”

He glanced at the frog key, then at her. “Star asked me to cut you off,” he said, no drama.

“Sparkles asked me to promise I’d keep distance,” Janna said. “I said no.”

“Same.”

They nodded like two people agreeing the sky exists.

“Thanks,” she said, tiny.

“Always,” he said, same.

He turned to go. She stopped him with a meme—an ancient jpg of a raccoon holding a piece of bread like a treasure, captioned THIS IS MY LIFE NOW. He snorted and disappeared down the hall.

Janna clicked off the lamp. The Diaz place breathed its warm, ordinary breath. Frog key winked. Holly chose her spot at Janna’s ribs and went to work purring. Janna pressed the fluorite to the fine seam of her chest, and the click inside lined up with the rest of the house.

“Okay,” she told the dark. “We’re doing this.”

Outside, November pressed its cold nose to the window and fogged the glass, but the room held. The couch didn’t bite. The spare bedroom waited with its labeled towels and ridiculous lasagna-pan throne. The day had been stupid and hard and survivable. That would do.

1pjnbue,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1pjnbue/cold_extractions_fastrapid_cold_brew/,"Cold Extractions (""Fast/Rapid Cold Brew"")","After trying a very delicious cold brew from a local coffee roaster/shop, I decided to make some at home after years of not making any. I have now been able to make very nice tasting cold extractions of medium and dark roasts using the Cafelat Robot.

I have previous experience making cold brew the old fashioned way: coffee in a container with water for 12-16 hours, then filtered... but these past few years I'd learned of cold extractions using the Aeropress and now the Oxxo Rapid Brewer. I almost bought one of those to experiment, but as I studied the physics involved in those extractions it became increasingly obvious that the Robot must be able to replicate them at least with medium and dark roasts.

Several attempts later, the results have been very impressive. Obviously if you don't enjoy cold brew this is not for you, but for those who do it's worth noting the Robot might help you produce something much more interesting and flavourful than most store-bought alternatives.

My method:

1. Grind 18g espresso fine (20 on K6)

2. Fill basket and tamp as usual, adding Robot's metal screen as usual (wet paper filter at the bottom is optional, but some brews have been better without)

3. Put basket in portafilter and add \~110g of room temperature (\~20C) water

4. Insert portafilter as usual

5. Lower arms ever-so-slightly until puck is fully infused and dropplets appear, as one would for an unpressurised shot

6. Use a small belt or cord to hold arms in place for 7 minutes

7. Lower arms slowly but firmly until all water has passed through, including hiss

8. Dilute resulting shot to taste with ice-cold water

  
It's been honestly very surprising to see how decent these have been. Probably not a very efficient way of making cold brew-like things in terms of yield per gram of coffee, but for something you can have in 10 minutes it's outstanding.

Will be trying some natural and light roasts in the coming months to see how they stack up. For now can only vouch for medium-dark.

Has anyone else experimented along these lines with success? Does it surprise you to learn that the Robot is capable of this? Personally I'd never come accross anyone discussing it.",4,1765423888.0,CafelatRobot,1,1.0,False

Oh, this BAG.

It’s a showstopper.

It’s a bag people stop you on the street to ask about.

It is EVERYTHING.

This was a serious gamble too. This bag could very very easily look “cheap” if it wasn’t done well. If the charms weren’t obviously high quality, it would ruin the whole look of the bag. BUT - based on the quality of the bags I had already received, I was reasonably sure I’d get something good. And boy, was I right.

The quality? Is out of this WORLD. Those charms? They’re not glued on, no ma’am. They’re BOLTED onto the bag. They’re going nowhere. The leather? Is soft supple calf or lambskin, I have no idea which, but it’s amazing. They nailed the ‘aged’ look of the reissue leather. This is my first Chanel reissue, and while I’ve never been a huge fan of the style, I do absolutely love this one. The chains are so cool, btw. I probably don't feel compelled to get any other non-charm reissues, but this one is so much fun.

There have been several versions of the lucky charms bag made by Chanel - mine is from 2017-2018.

Here’s a [link to the exact bag on Fashionphile](https://www.fashionphile.com/products/chanel-aged-calfskin-lucky-charms-255-reissue-225-flap-black-1763280) \- I can find some minor differences in the layout of the charms, but overall? Pretty DAMN close. I can't knock the seller for that.

Also - I like to try to guess which factories these bags are from, and so far, I've seen this bag in the Kaxin factory album for about the same price. So, that's where I'm guessing. But honestly, who knows.

This is the perfect bag to round out my (rapidly growing) classic flap collection - I love that it’s still a classic, but FUN. I love that each of the charms means something different, and I had so much fun looking up the meanings online. I love that it’s fun and unique, but still super wearable! All in all, this might be my favorite Chanel bag that I currently own.

Do I recommend you get one? YES

So - I didn’t exactly set out to buy 6 different bags from LuxuryDesignerBag1, but that’s kinda what I ended up doing, and I don’t regret it a bit. These are some of the best bags in my collection right now, and I can say that I thoroughly recommend them. A bit pricey? Yes. **But on DHG, you get what you pay for.** I paid more for these bags than I probably would have from a TS, probably. Yes, I could have gotten a bag at “xyz” factory for a similar price.

But? I really don’t care about the made up factory names on Reddit. The only benefit to those that I can see is that they make bags easier to rehome when you can say it’s from blah-blah factory (and isn’t it also interesting how every classic flap being rehomed on Reddit seems to be from either GF, Blake/Rome, or 187? what a coincidence)

So yeah, I really don’t care about factory names. I really only care about the quality of the item I get. These bags all feel very good quality to me, so I’m happy.

However - if factory names are super important to you, buying on DHG probably isn’t going to work for you, because it’s next to impossible to verify which factory your bag is coming from.

>Prem Bahadur Ale, the former Tourism and Aviation Minister, has made a bold statement about corruption in Nepal’s two newest international airports. He said, “**पोखरा एयरपोर्टको भ्रष्टाचार त ट्रेलर मात्र हो। २३ अर्बको जग्गा खरिद गरेर भैरहवा एयरपोर्टमा भ्रष्टाचार भएको छ। अहिले त्यो एयरपोर्टमा हजारौँ भैंसी चरिरहेका छन्, माछापालन भइरहेको छ।”**

>The complaint, filed on Chaitra 3, 2081 BS (March 16, 2025), claims that although the airport project cost around Rs. 6 billion excluding land compensation, an additional Rs. 13 billion was allegedly misappropriated through fraudulent practices related to land acquisition, compensation distribution, and equipment procurement.

>**According to the petitioner, compensation for land acquisition was massively inflated beyond official government rates. It is alleged that properties not connected to main roads were compensated at premium rates, typically reserved for road-adjacent plots, due to collusion between project officials and local brokers**. **Land that had been donated for public use—such as temples, schools, and monasteries—was reportedly acquired under false claims from individuals pretending to be heirs of deceased owners, and compensation was disbursed under fraudulent identities.**

>**The complaint also accuses project officials of inflating assessments for damage to homes and public buildings in order to receive kickbacks.** The funds, initially deposited in the name of legitimate landowners, were allegedly siphoned off by brokers acting on behalf of corrupt officials, including then Project Chief Prabhesh Adhikari and accountant Pradeep Kumar Sah.

>**Whenever a new infrastructure project is proposed, intermediaries quickly become active. Those with strong political connections buy local land at low prices and then inflate its value to claim higher compensation.  According to the complainant, Yogesh Bhattarai discouraged his fellow lawmakers from raising corruption concerns during the visit, presenting the airport project as a success despite objections from other committee members. The complaint suggests that Bhattarai maintained close ties with CAAN Director General Pradeep Adhikari** and benefited from personal favors, including a luxury cars and alleged investments made in real estate and hospitality ventures under the names of Bhattarai and his relatives. **Due to political pressure, compensation was paid at up to nine times the land’s actual value.**

1pjn4np,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1pjn4np/every_flame_is_a_gate_to_the_same_fire/,Every Flame Is A Gate To the Same Fire,"To Whom It May Concern,

I hope this missive finds you well. Fetch your smelling salts and position a cold compress on your forehead, because this one is what they used to call a motherfucking doozey.

Are you fanning yourself right now? Heaving bosom? Colour rising in your cheeks? Unlace your bodice a bit. Maybe crack open a window. Things are about to get humid in here.

Like an old world god I go by many names. Greg. Ben Kenobi. ""That Guy who always goes through the self checkout with whatever protein bars are discounted, pre made pico de gaillo, and a moderately priced bath bomb"". Randy Tenderloin. The Eye of the Carrion Storm. Khomaniac. Malfeitor. Ranger Brown. Tom Bombadil Jr. ""Not him again"". CHAW. El Paso Pete. Prudence Goodweather, owner of an well maintained '89 buick lesabre that smells like menthol cigarettes and burning styrofoam. etc.etc.etc.

Pick one. Pick none. Either works, you can call me anything you like but know this.

I'm not nursing dying embers.

I'm not lighting a candle for you.

I'm not carrying a torch for you.

Twin flames? Old flames? Don't make me fucking laugh.

There is only one fire. The all consuming inferno burning at the end of time. The scorching apotheosis. Every flame is a gate to that same fire.

Lets open it.

You are already the hottest of messes. Devouring all the oxygen in any room you are in, literally breathtaking.

But now is not the time for a surfeit of compliments like that. You are also an emotional wreck and you have clearly been subjected to a system of routine debasement and bled out at the margins until there is almost nothing left of your light hearted and mischevious nature. And that's a problem. Because I happen to be very fond of that nature. But given your need for recovery I can't really say more. Capitalizing on the fact that you are currently very vulnerable for my own self gratification would be manipulative.

So lets put things on ice for now. Nothing Romantic. We won't even consider that question for at least 6 months.

It's a problem because I don't know what you want. But it's clear you don't know what you want either. And won't know what you want until you are feeling better.

Like I told you, Romantic is just a word, it means, ""pertaining to the romans"".

We are shifting the entire paradigm.

Fuck the romans. Did you really think I was gonna build aqueducts with you?

You know what they say...

When in Rome, burn that motherfucker to the ground.

I know you are terrified of everything right now. I know why you are terrified of everything right now. We won't expound on that subject here. We won't expound on that subject anywhere unless you want to.

I know you are dreading seeing me in person because of one inexorable fact, you are someone who conveys affection with physical contact. We could try shake hands, but most likely if we saw each other it would be a hug. Will it go on too long? Will people watch? Will it evolve into something more? Like a winged gliding lizard from the cretaceous era evolving into a winged gliding lizard from the cretaceous era with a couple feathers that are obviously computer generated imagery?

It will not evolve into something more. That hug will go extinct before it evolves into something more. They will find the hug in a piece of amber and clone it later of course, but that's not my fucking problem.

Life finds a way. Love finds a way.

I will not ravish you. And I will not facilitate anything of the sort from you either. Even if you think it is romantic, it wouldn't be good for you now. I'll be sure to take precautions. You know it's the 21st century, right? They make ergonomically designed sex toys for men now. You can do almost anything with a hypoallergic ergonomically designed sex toy made out of fair trade materials if you have the right attitude.

Isn't that what the American Dream is all about?

That isn't the only precaution I'll take. We'll also only meet at a Burger King. I will arrive first and sit in the most expansive corner booth possible.

You will arrive later and seat yourself wherever you want. Every 15 minutes you will walk to the drink refill station with your 48 ounce beverage recepticle and get a new cup of crushed ice to dump in my lap. There will be nothing sexually aggressive happening. The crushed ice you will be dumping in my lap at regular intervals will see to that.

The things we do for love right?

You will leave first. Do not worry. I will not lean in to kiss you. I can't handle that sort of pressure for fresh breath. You probably expect minty fresh breath, I am too old to deal with those ridiculous expectations. This isn't the fucking bachelor. I don't have minty fresh breath. Fuck the winterfresh overlords at Listerine. Freshening strips? I ain't buying that shit. If you don't like the taste of bubblegum aquafresh then you don't deserve me.

If you really want to kiss later we will do it Lady and the Tramp style. I'll buy some extra long pasta noodles off amazon prime. I will pre soak one or two of them the night before our reunion at the most expansive corner booth of a burger king. I will Store the noodles in a special pocket of the slightly unbuttoned rodeo shirt I will be wearing to impress you, in the secret breast pocket right beside my vintage 256 mb Lexar flash drive.

I'm assuming you would want to be the lady in this lady and the tramp situation, but it's the 21st century. You can be whatever you want to be. Unless you want to be the squinting Siamese cat that does the musical number with the chopsticks.

Some parts of classic movies have aged less well than others, lets just leave it at that.

After this optional Lady and the Tramp situation I will stay in the booth until I see you pull out of the parking lot. Only then will I stand, my heart full and my groin frostbitten.

Love is a razor and I walk the line on that silver blade...

I wish you would convey ideas to me. Anywhere. I understand why you are so uncomfortable with all these things, and we aren't going to dwell on it.

But there needs to be a secure line of communication between us. Some of the ways you get ideas across to me are not healthy.

Now that I know you have multiple reddit accounts, it's become a problem though. Because you could be literally anywhere. You could be literally anyone.

Now I don't just suspect anyone. I have a list of criteria, they have to match at least 4 before I send a vague message inquiring as to the first letter of their first name.

The scorched earth approach to romance. Everyone is you until proven otherwise. There are some problems though. The massive amount of collateral damage for one.

Yes, I did approach a suspect that fit the criteria. The penchant for crocheting had me convinced there was a strong .0125% chance it might be you.

I told my suspect, ""Let's exchange first initials, we'll type them at the same time.""

She definitely wasn't the person I was looking for. She was also very nosy and wanted to know more about why I was searching for someone in a crocheting sub reddit.

Because I had assumed there was a small chance she might be the person I was looking for, I bet you can guess what happened next.

Yep, she assumed I was the person she was looking for.

A day later she wrote an unhinged post on an arts and crafts reddit in which she angrily excoriated a past lover named Billy for calling her fat behind her back to her good friends in the Mahjong club but made it clear that once Billy takes off his denim overalls all bets are off and vigorous sexual relations will be on the menu alongside her famous three bean casserole.

I feel guilty about it.

I wish there was a way I could talk to you that didn't involve the depraved sexual proclivities of yarn enthusiasts. I wish I could be one of the romantic types here, I'd love to do some shit straight out of a hallmark channel original movie, show up with a single rose and my shirt firmly tucked into my pleated khakis, ready for whatever awaits us in the romantic confines of an unusually spacious supply closet with supplies conveniently arranged in positions facilitating different vaguely sexual positions and multiple camera angles. This is a hallmark movie though, no suggestive gasping, only stock piano music until the door swings open and the vice principal discovers us gently nuzzling eachother amongst the crayolas and elmers glue.

Unfortunately the lustful congress in the unusually spacious supply closet will not be happening, the inquisition I have launched is a ravenous machine that must be fed. I fear soon half of reddit will be consumed in a cloying miasma of spicy intrigue. This might have gotten out of hand.

Mrs. Three Bean Casserole was not the only victim of my misplace inquisitorial tendencies either. Yes, the search did expand to other arts and crafts subreddits. Then the search expanded to Etsy. I browsed Etsy for an entire day, cross referencing listings for hand knitted sweaters for vintage dolls with my other evidence.

I nearly etsied until my eyes liquified and ran from their sockets like the yolks of eggs.

The awkward thing here is that even after 6 straight hours of scrolling through Etsy hoping for a revalation regarding your situation I still don't know what you want. Your hints are too ambiguous.

Some of the things you might want, the kinds of things I read about in other posts around these parts, are not things we would want to bring up now. You don't have to reward someone who helps you with that kind of attention. It is not healthy to even unintentionally make that seem justified.

I will say this, whatever you want, I can accommodate. At some point you need to give unambiguous consent that you even want me in your life though. The hints and everything and the implications are flattering, but unambiguous consent is better.

I'm an old fashioned kind of guy, and that means I have old fashioned ideals. Wagnerian shit. Love can be quantified by how many things you are willing to burn for someone. There is a swathe of scorched earth cutting across several states I have left behind in search of you. I wouldn't just burn the world for you. We gotta pump those numbers up, Those are rookie numbers. There are 8 more worlds in this metaphor, I'd burn all of them for you too.

Yes, even the world with the mirthful elves and gently tinkling streams and little houses made of toadstool mushrooms.

I will shatter the rainbow bridge and tell the angry gods to shove the cheerfully chromatic sparkling rainbow shards up their collective asses.

Has any man ever told you that before? I fucking doubt it.

I don't want to harass you. I want to be sure of that. While I know it's flattering to be pursued, I don't like the ""harassment = caring"" dynamic. Especially when I end up accidentally harassing someone who isn't you who tells me I am not ""their person"". Is that the terminology around these parts? Do you want to be my person? I think you should become your own person first. Maybe we can split you 50/50. But not like the biblical King Solomon suggested. The biblical King Solomon is a fucking dick. I'm more of a Hamurabi fan myself.

I realize there are certain things I am not quite picking up on that need to be handled very delicately. No matter how much I care about you, I am a guy. A guy who has had certain kinds of relations with you in the past cornering you somewhere no one else can see and putting you on the spot. I can't help that. I tried to convey my sincerity and lack of ulterior motives, but it hasn't worked. That is never going to feel safe no matter what I do. You need to be deprogrammed and cared for. You don't believe I want to do that without secretly wanting to assert sexual dominance or ownership of you. That breaks my heart, but I get it. At first I was hurt that you didn't remember I would never be licentious with you, but you have been through an awful lot. I should have realized earlier that I should have been there for it. There is no excuse for that. I am sorry.

That's why I am posting here. You will feel much safer and less predated if the person conveying concern for you is willing to be laughed at in public. Willingness to be laughed at is a good indication of the purity of ones intentions.

They will laugh at me. Yes, because I am a sensitive man, but I will put my best foot forwards and suggest a homo erotic Greco Roman wrestling tournament if that's what it takes. Oil me up and chuckle if you wish. We're going to fucking Olive Garden. Only two things in this entire fucking universe are unending after all, Olive Garden's breadsticks and my love for you. My love for you doesn'tr have as many carbohydraates, it is best enjoyed alongside crepes at a light brunch.

The brunches can get hot and heavy later. There is nothing like a hot and heavy brunch.

I don't expect you to immediately snap out of it. This will require time and compassion. You have to give me feedback on the approaches I am taking. You have to tell me if you do not want me involved in your life at all. Accomplishing all of what we need to accomplish involves striking a very delicate balance between many very delicate things. I don't want to make you feel repulsive and unwanted, because you most certainly are not, but not only is now not the time for lechery, I am not sure what you want. I don't think you know what you want. That is a very difficult balance to strike, and you have to provide feedback on how well my methods are working.

We will definitely put elements of our relationship from the past on ice for at least six months. I don't want you to think you owe me anything or should do anything just because that's what those raunchy paperback novels the old women read in church say.

You know the novels I am talking about. The softcore porn Oregon Trail type shit. They always have the same climax. Some fur trapper dude kills the bear that was going to kill the Squaw with mysteriously Caucasian looking features and skins the bear with a jagged rock and wears its pelt like a onesie while he fireman carries his squaw back to his cabin to makes love to her amongst his various ""Home Sweet Home"" pillows showcasing his skill at needlepoint embroidery and his rustic home decor.

Love is made, in fact love is made multiple times amongst the rural charm of patchwork blankets and ceramic figurines of jesus riding various farm animals as he blows a trumpet. After the lovemaking, the fur trapper goes outside and it is magically spring. They made love all winter. He tears out a handful of grass from the ground, takes it inside, and puts it in the cauldron of boiling water in his fireplace. He says to his squaw, ""Your tea will be ready soon my love"". She gives him the old ""make love to me on this rustic furniture made of random logs upholstered in meaty bits of animal carcasses while wearing your bearskin onesie until my tea is ready my love"" eyes.

Their lovemaking goes on too long and just as he is climaxing the tea overflows and a single spark lands on his bearskin onesie. The squaw is contently staring at the ceiling but suddenly she sniffs the air and yells ""YOUR BEARSKIN IS BURNING, MY LOVE."" Soon The entire cabin is burning down and they desperately try to save things but the few clothes they were wearing are burned off their bodies. They are naked and they escape in a really sexy way covered in soot and look happy to be alive when they emerge from the smoldering wreckage of the fur trappers once proud fuck shack, because even though they lost the bearskin onesie they still have eachother. They are about to make love again but suddenly they realize they are being watched. They are being watched by an entire tribe of scandalized looking indians.

The squaws tribe has found her. Her fathers top Brave was just about to knock on the front door of the cabin when it started burning down. They have been searching for the squaw.

The Fur Trapper and the squaw try to preserve their modesty with whatever is on hand while they are silently judged by an entire tribe of Indians.

The wise Chief sits on his horse. He has a headdress, and a matching spear. The best chiefs never settle for less than a matching set when it comes to spears and headdresses. Everyone knows that.The Chiefs horse is an appaloosa. The only kind of horse worth a shit according to my weird aunt. Never settle for less than an appaloosa. From his vantage point high atop his appaloosa the Chief stares at his daughter with his somber Indian eyes. The type of somber Indian eyes that can only be had by an actor actually born in Italy who had plastic surgery and changed his name to something ""authentic Indian"" sounding. Father Chieftan on his appaloosa clears his throat and melodically intones in his somber Indian voice,

""WHO IS THIS MAN? AND WHY IS HE COVERING HIS FLACID PENIS WITH A DECORATIVE THROW PILLOW? MY DAUGHTER, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE WAYS OF OUR ANCESTORS?""

Anyways, there is obviously a sequel to that book, but we will talk about that later.

The point is I am not going to attempt to cure you with penetrative sex. I am not Indiana Jones, I am not going to use my bullwhip to pull you closer and start making out, ignoring the sounds of your half hearted protests as we grind against each other on a rickety rope bridge while an offensive caricature of an Asian child sidekick shouts, ""MISTAH JONES, MISTAH JONES, YOU SHOULDN'T STAND ON THAT RICKETY ROPE BRIDGE MISTAH JONES. MISTAH JONES TAKE YOUR FOREPLAY ELSEWHERE MISTAH JONES. MISTAH JONES MAKE SURE THE HR DEPARTMENT ISN'T WATCHING MISTAH JONES OR ELSE THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW US THAT POWER POINT AT A LUNCH SEMINAR ON GENDER DYNAMICS AGAIN"".

There will be no slap-slap-kiss-no-means-yes-room-service-bring-me-some-champagne 007 shit. That only happens in Hollywood. Yes, most screenwriters in the 60s and 70s assumed abused women who have been conditioned to associate sex with control who have just been rescued from traumatic situations will automatically self lubricate and forget all of their trauma the second Sean Connery physically assaults them in a high end hotel suite/high end submarine lounge/high end aerial gondola.

Yes, most screenwriting in the 60s and 70s was powered by massive amounts of cocaine.

How many mysterious hot chicks from random phone numbers I have never seen before claiming to know me from an unspecified collegiate level class I never took are going to ask me out for coffee or offer to ""make me feel good"" in a small independently owned bookshop with a bakery specializing in large golden brown croissants before you realize that right now I really am only interested in caring for you?

I don't know if they all remind me of you because I miss you so much, or if they remind me of you because they obviously are you using alternate phone numbers from a questionable app trying to figure out whether I will abandon you the second I am approached by a nubile co-ed promising savory pastries, miniature mugs of rich hot chocolate topped with whipped cream, and sophisticated conversational experiences.

What do you think? What does your heart say?

Your heart probably says ""He probably won't dine with the nubile co-ed and the miniature mugs of hot chocolate over me. But That's only because he's lactose intolerant, don't mistake his lactose intolerance for loyalty.""

That's because you have low self esteem. You could not be more wrong.

There are only three things in this entire fucking universe that are endless; Olive Garden's breadsticks, the tolerance for lactose I carry within me, and

my love for you.

Yes, if you are who I am looking for you are panicking right now. Deep breaths. Re-read all of what I typed. There is no identifying information. You will be OK. You can't run away and hide from everything.

If anyone did recognize me and use it to identify you I would just claim my account was hacked by an overly ambitious scammer from Bangladesh suffering from food poisoning.

Time for some Chaos Theory Goldilocks. Mama Bear, Poppa Bear, and Baby Bear ain't here.

Their bile is being drained in an unlicensed bushmeat market. I hope you don't mind me taking a brief detour to raise awareness about unlicensed bushmeat markets?

I have to make sure this process is done in the way that is most comfortable for you. Right now I don't know if you are even comfortable with any sort of process occurring at all. I am going to need more information than that. If you don't want any of this, emphatically state it. You are calling the shots. You were always supposed to be the one calling the shots.

It's going to be hard to balance all these disparate elements. The flippant obtuse sense of humor I assume you love so much because I am not handsome at all and have few other positive qualities has to be balanced with the sincerity of my affection for you. You are in a paradoxical place. Some things will make you feel good and feel objectified at the same time. Some of the things you want so badly you also recognize are not good for you.

A simple thing like calling you a hot mess is a choice I agonize over. Hopefully that wasn't too aggressive. ""Room Temperature Mess"" just doesn't have the same passion behind it.

A lot of people would say, ""You shouldn't help her, a therapist should do it"".

Then why didn't a therapist do anything for the past decade? Most therapists simply don't give a shit. It's a job.

Its your choice though. If you have someone better you should immediately let me know.

Until then I will keep typing paragraphs that consist of a single sentence.

Fuck the notion of multiple sentences in a paragraph.

Every sentence should also be a paragraph.

It's called formatting motherfucker.

Learn it.

Be flustered.

You have to convey unambiguous consent that you want that kind of attention to me or I will have to cease all of these attempts very soon. There are lines I can't cross without your unambiguous consent. I don't support the notion that harassment is equivalent to affection. This isn't Gone With The Wind. Frankly my dear, I give a damn.

You can do it. I know you are evasive with words, especially in your current fraught state, but I believe in you. Tell me what is going on.

Close your eyes and become the conduit. Chaos of Forms. This isn't Rome. There are no barbarians at the gate. You are the gate.

Seasons fucking tidings to all the people this letter isn't meant for.

Thanks for reading this. The individual this is for will never come around to believing any of these things as long as she is the only one to hear them. Things need to be witnessed to be true. I could say about a billion things all about how proud I am of her, and how utterly unique she is. But actions speak louder than words and she probably thinks I would be too embarrassed to ever post in a place like this. She has never been publicly recognized for any of the things that make her so special in a way that wasn't objectifying, and it's about time someone does it. I have never been ashamed to say that or been ashamed of her.

And I will say this only once, I would hold my person in higher esteem if English was her native language or she was more like an ""American Girl"".

I hope this missive finds you well. Fetch your smelling salts and position a cold compress on your forehead, because this one is what they used to call a motherfucking doozey.

Are you fanning yourself right now? Heaving bosom? Colour rising in your cheeks? Unlace your bodice a bit. Maybe crack open a window. Things are about to get humid in here.

Like an old world god I go by many names. Greg. Ben Kenobi. ""That Guy who always goes through the self checkout with whatever protein bars are discounted, pre made pico de gaillo, and a moderately priced bath bomb"". Randy Tenderloin. The Eye of the Carrion Storm. Khomaniac. Malfeitor. Ranger Brown. Tom Bombadil Jr. ""Not him again"". CHAW. El Paso Pete. Prudence Goodweather, owner of an well maintained '89 buick lesabre that smells like menthol cigarettes and burning styrofoam. etc.etc.etc.

Pick one. Pick none. Either works, you can call me anything you like but know this.

I'm not nursing dying embers.

I'm not lighting a candle for you.

I'm not carrying a torch for you.

Twin flames? Old flames? Don't make me fucking laugh.

There is only one fire. The all consuming inferno burning at the end of time. The scorching apotheosis. Every flame is a gate to that same fire.

Lets open it.

You are already the hottest of messes. Devouring all the oxygen in any room you are in, literally breathtaking.

But now is not the time for a surfeit of compliments like that. You are also an emotional wreck and you have clearly been subjected to a system of routine debasement and bled out at the margins until there is almost nothing left of your light hearted and mischevious nature. And that's a problem. Because I happen to be very fond of that nature. But given your need for recovery I can't really say more. Capitalizing on the fact that you are currently very vulnerable for my own self gratification would be manipulative.

So lets put things on ice for now. Nothing Romantic. We won't even consider that question for at least 6 months.

It's a problem because I don't know what you want. But it's clear you don't know what you want either. And won't know what you want until you are feeling better.

Like I told you, Romantic is just a word, it means, ""pertaining to the romans"".

We are shifting the entire paradigm.

Fuck the romans. Did you really think I was gonna build aqueducts with you?

You know what they say...

When in Rome, burn that motherfucker to the ground.

I know you are terrified of everything right now. I know why you are terrified of everything right now. We won't expound on that subject here. We won't expound on that subject anywhere unless you want to.

I know you are dreading seeing me in person because of one inexorable fact, you are someone who conveys affection with physical contact. We could try shake hands, but most likely if we saw each other it would be a hug. Will it go on too long? Will people watch? Will it evolve into something more? Like a winged gliding lizard from the cretaceous era evolving into a winged gliding lizard from the cretaceous era with a couple feathers that are obviously computer generated imagery?

It will not evolve into something more. That hug will go extinct before it evolves into something more. They will find the hug in a piece of amber and clone it later of course, but that's not my fucking problem.

Life finds a way. Love finds a way.

I will not ravish you. And I will not facilitate anything of the sort from you either. Even if you think it is romantic, it wouldn't be good for you now. I'll be sure to take precautions. You know it's the 21st century, right? They make ergonomically designed sex toys for men now. You can do almost anything with a hypoallergic ergonomically designed sex toy made out of fair trade materials if you have the right attitude.

Isn't that what the American Dream is all about?

That isn't the only precaution I'll take. We'll also only meet at a Burger King. I will arrive first and sit in the most expansive corner booth possible.

You will arrive later and seat yourself wherever you want. Every 15 minutes you will walk to the drink refill station with your 48 ounce beverage recepticle and get a new cup of crushed ice to dump in my lap. There will be nothing sexually aggressive happening. The crushed ice you will be dumping in my lap at regular intervals will see to that.

The things we do for love right?

You will leave first. Do not worry. I will not lean in to kiss you. I can't handle that sort of pressure for fresh breath. You probably expect minty fresh breath, I am too old to deal with those ridiculous expectations. This isn't the fucking bachelor. I don't have minty fresh breath. Fuck the winterfresh overlords at Listerine. Freshening strips? I ain't buying that shit. If you don't like the taste of bubblegum aquafresh then you don't deserve me.

If you really want to kiss later we will do it Lady and the Tramp style. I'll buy some extra long pasta noodles off amazon prime. I will pre soak one or two of them the night before our reunion at the most expansive corner booth of a burger king. I will Store the noodles in a special pocket of the slightly unbuttoned rodeo shirt I will be wearing to impress you, in the secret breast pocket right beside my vintage 256 mb Lexar flash drive.

I'm assuming you would want to be the lady in this lady and the tramp situation, but it's the 21st century. You can be whatever you want to be. Unless you want to be the squinting Siamese cat that does the musical number with the chopsticks.

Some parts of classic movies have aged less well than others, lets just leave it at that.

After this optional Lady and the Tramp situation I will stay in the booth until I see you pull out of the parking lot. Only then will I stand, my heart full and my groin frostbitten.

Love is a razor and I walk the line on that silver blade...

I wish you would convey ideas to me. Anywhere. I understand why you are so uncomfortable with all these things, and we aren't going to dwell on it.

But there needs to be a secure line of communication between us. Some of the ways you get ideas across to me are not healthy.

Now that I know you have multiple reddit accounts, it's become a problem though. Because you could be literally anywhere. You could be literally anyone.

Now I don't just suspect anyone. I have a list of criteria, they have to match at least 4 before I send a vague message inquiring as to the first letter of their first name.

The scorched earth approach to romance. Everyone is you until proven otherwise. There are some problems though. The massive amount of collateral damage for one.

Yes, I did approach a suspect that fit the criteria. The penchant for crocheting had me convinced there was a strong .0125% chance it might be you.

I told my suspect, ""Let's exchange first initials, we'll type them at the same time.""

She definitely wasn't the person I was looking for. She was also very nosy and wanted to know more about why I was searching for someone in a crocheting sub reddit.

Because I had assumed there was a small chance she might be the person I was looking for, I bet you can guess what happened next.

Yep, she assumed I was the person she was looking for.

A day later she wrote an unhinged post on an arts and crafts reddit in which she angrily excoriated a past lover named Billy for calling her fat behind her back to her good friends in the Mahjong club but made it clear that once Billy takes off his denim overalls all bets are off and vigorous sexual relations will be on the menu alongside her famous three bean casserole.

I feel guilty about it.

I wish there was a way I could talk to you that didn't involve the depraved sexual proclivities of yarn enthusiasts. I wish I could be one of the romantic types here, I'd love to do some shit straight out of a hallmark channel original movie, show up with a single rose and my shirt firmly tucked into my pleated khakis, ready for whatever awaits us in the romantic confines of an unusually spacious supply closet with supplies conveniently arranged in positions facilitating different vaguely sexual positions and multiple camera angles. This is a hallmark movie though, no suggestive gasping, only stock piano music until the door swings open and the vice principal discovers us gently nuzzling eachother amongst the crayolas and elmers glue.

Unfortunately the lustful congress in the unusually spacious supply closet will not be happening, the inquisition I have launched is a ravenous machine that must be fed. I fear soon half of reddit will be consumed in a cloying miasma of spicy intrigue. This might have gotten out of hand.

Mrs. Three Bean Casserole was not the only victim of my misplace inquisitorial tendencies either. Yes, the search did expand to other arts and crafts subreddits. Then the search expanded to Etsy. I browsed Etsy for an entire day, cross referencing listings for hand knitted sweaters for vintage dolls with my other evidence.

I nearly etsied until my eyes liquified and ran from their sockets like the yolks of eggs.

The awkward thing here is that even after 6 straight hours of scrolling through Etsy hoping for a revalation regarding your situation I still don't know what you want. Your hints are too ambiguous.

Some of the things you might want, the kinds of things I read about in other posts around these parts, are not things we would want to bring up now. You don't have to reward someone who helps you with that kind of attention. It is not healthy to even unintentionally make that seem justified.

I will say this, whatever you want, I can accommodate. At some point you need to give unambiguous consent that you even want me in your life though. The hints and everything and the implications are flattering, but unambiguous consent is better.

I'm an old fashioned kind of guy, and that means I have old fashioned ideals. Wagnerian shit. Love can be quantified by how many things you are willing to burn for someone. There is a swathe of scorched earth cutting across several states I have left behind in search of you. I wouldn't just burn the world for you. We gotta pump those numbers up, Those are rookie numbers. There are 8 more worlds in this metaphor, I'd burn all of them for you too.

Yes, even the world with the mirthful elves and gently tinkling streams and little houses made of toadstool mushrooms.

I will shatter the rainbow bridge and tell the angry gods to shove the cheerfully chromatic sparkling rainbow shards up their collective asses.

Has any man ever told you that before? I fucking doubt it.

I don't want to harass you. I want to be sure of that. While I know it's flattering to be pursued, I don't like the ""harassment = caring"" dynamic. Especially when I end up accidentally harassing someone who isn't you who tells me I am not ""their person"". Is that the terminology around these parts? Do you want to be my person? I think you should become your own person first. Maybe we can split you 50/50. But not like the biblical King Solomon suggested. The biblical King Solomon is a fucking dick. I'm more of a Hamurabi fan myself.

I realize there are certain things I am not quite picking up on that need to be handled very delicately. No matter how much I care about you, I am a guy. A guy who has had certain kinds of relations with you in the past cornering you somewhere no one else can see and putting you on the spot. I can't help that. I tried to convey my sincerity and lack of ulterior motives, but it hasn't worked. That is never going to feel safe no matter what I do. You need to be deprogrammed and cared for. You don't believe I want to do that without secretly wanting to assert sexual dominance or ownership of you. That breaks my heart, but I get it. At first I was hurt that you didn't remember I would never be licentious with you, but you have been through an awful lot. I should have realized earlier that I should have been there for it. There is no excuse for that. I am sorry.

That's why I am posting here. You will feel much safer and less predated if the person conveying concern for you is willing to be laughed at in public. Willingness to be laughed at is a good indication of the purity of ones intentions.

They will laugh at me. Yes, because I am a sensitive man, but I will put my best foot forwards and suggest a homo erotic Greco Roman wrestling tournament if that's what it takes. Oil me up and chuckle if you wish. We're going to fucking Olive Garden. Only two things in this entire fucking universe are unending after all, Olive Garden's breadsticks and my love for you. My love for you doesn'tr have as many carbohydraates, it is best enjoyed alongside crepes at a light brunch.

The brunches can get hot and heavy later. There is nothing like a hot and heavy brunch.

I don't expect you to immediately snap out of it. This will require time and compassion. You have to give me feedback on the approaches I am taking. You have to tell me if you do not want me involved in your life at all. Accomplishing all of what we need to accomplish involves striking a very delicate balance between many very delicate things. I don't want to make you feel repulsive and unwanted, because you most certainly are not, but not only is now not the time for lechery, I am not sure what you want. I don't think you know what you want. That is a very difficult balance to strike, and you have to provide feedback on how well my methods are working.

We will definitely put elements of our relationship from the past on ice for at least six months. I don't want you to think you owe me anything or should do anything just because that's what those raunchy paperback novels the old women read in church say.

You know the novels I am talking about. The softcore porn Oregon Trail type shit. They always have the same climax. Some fur trapper dude kills the bear that was going to kill the Squaw with mysteriously Caucasian looking features and skins the bear with a jagged rock and wears its pelt like a onesie while he fireman carries his squaw back to his cabin to makes love to her amongst his various ""Home Sweet Home"" pillows showcasing his skill at needlepoint embroidery and his rustic home decor.

Love is made, in fact love is made multiple times amongst the rural charm of patchwork blankets and ceramic figurines of jesus riding various farm animals as he blows a trumpet. After the lovemaking, the fur trapper goes outside and it is magically spring. They made love all winter. He tears out a handful of grass from the ground, takes it inside, and puts it in the cauldron of boiling water in his fireplace. He says to his squaw, ""Your tea will be ready soon my love"". She gives him the old ""make love to me on this rustic furniture made of random logs upholstered in meaty bits of animal carcasses while wearing your bearskin onesie until my tea is ready my love"" eyes.

Their lovemaking goes on too long and just as he is climaxing the tea overflows and a single spark lands on his bearskin onesie. The squaw is contently staring at the ceiling but suddenly she sniffs the air and yells ""YOUR BEARSKIN IS BURNING, MY LOVE."" Soon The entire cabin is burning down and they desperately try to save things but the few clothes they were wearing are burned off their bodies. They are naked and they escape in a really sexy way covered in soot and look happy to be alive when they emerge from the smoldering wreckage of the fur trappers once proud fuck shack, because even though they lost the bearskin onesie they still have eachother. They are about to make love again but suddenly they realize they are being watched. They are being watched by an entire tribe of scandalized looking indians.

The squaws tribe has found her. Her fathers top Brave was just about to knock on the front door of the cabin when it started burning down. They have been searching for the squaw.

The Fur Trapper and the squaw try to preserve their modesty with whatever is on hand while they are silently judged by an entire tribe of Indians.

The wise Chief sits on his horse. He has a headdress, and a matching spear. The best chiefs never settle for less than a matching set when it comes to spears and headdresses. Everyone knows that.The Chiefs horse is an appaloosa. The only kind of horse worth a shit according to my weird aunt. Never settle for less than an appaloosa. From his vantage point high atop his appaloosa the Chief stares at his daughter with his somber Indian eyes. The type of somber Indian eyes that can only be had by an actor actually born in Italy who had plastic surgery and changed his name to something ""authentic Indian"" sounding. Father Chieftan on his appaloosa clears his throat and melodically intones in his somber Indian voice,

""WHO IS THIS MAN? AND WHY IS HE COVERING HIS FLACID PENIS WITH A DECORATIVE THROW PILLOW? MY DAUGHTER, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE WAYS OF OUR ANCESTORS?""

Anyways, there is obviously a sequel to that book, but we will talk about that later.

The point is I am not going to attempt to cure you with penetrative sex. I am not Indiana Jones, I am not going to use my bullwhip to pull you closer and start making out, ignoring the sounds of your half hearted protests as we grind against each other on a rickety rope bridge while an offensive caricature of an Asian child sidekick shouts, ""MISTAH JONES, MISTAH JONES, YOU SHOULDN'T STAND ON THAT RICKETY ROPE BRIDGE MISTAH JONES. MISTAH JONES TAKE YOUR FOREPLAY ELSEWHERE MISTAH JONES. MISTAH JONES MAKE SURE THE HR DEPARTMENT ISN'T WATCHING MISTAH JONES OR ELSE THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW US THAT POWER POINT AT A LUNCH SEMINAR ON GENDER DYNAMICS AGAIN"".

There will be no slap-slap-kiss-no-means-yes-room-service-bring-me-some-champagne 007 shit. That only happens in Hollywood. Yes, most screenwriters in the 60s and 70s assumed abused women who have been conditioned to associate sex with control who have just been rescued from traumatic situations will automatically self lubricate and forget all of their trauma the second Sean Connery physically assaults them in a high end hotel suite/high end submarine lounge/high end aerial gondola.

Yes, most screenwriting in the 60s and 70s was powered by massive amounts of cocaine.

How many mysterious hot chicks from random phone numbers I have never seen before claiming to know me from an unspecified collegiate level class I never took are going to ask me out for coffee or offer to ""make me feel good"" in a small independently owned bookshop with a bakery specializing in large golden brown croissants before you realize that right now I really am only interested in caring for you?

I don't know if they all remind me of you because I miss you so much, or if they remind me of you because they obviously are you using alternate phone numbers from a questionable app trying to figure out whether I will abandon you the second I am approached by a nubile co-ed promising savory pastries, miniature mugs of rich hot chocolate topped with whipped cream, and sophisticated conversational experiences.

What do you think? What does your heart say?

Your heart probably says ""He probably won't dine with the nubile co-ed and the miniature mugs of hot chocolate over me. But That's only because he's lactose intolerant, don't mistake his lactose intolerance for loyalty.""

That's because you have low self esteem. You could not be more wrong.

There are only three things in this entire fucking universe that are endless; Olive Garden's breadsticks, the tolerance for lactose I carry within me, and

my love for you.

Yes, if you are who I am looking for you are panicking right now. Deep breaths. Re-read all of what I typed. There is no identifying information. You will be OK. You can't run away and hide from everything.

If anyone did recognize me and use it to identify you I would just claim my account was hacked by an overly ambitious scammer from Bangladesh suffering from food poisoning.

Time for some Chaos Theory Goldilocks. Mama Bear, Poppa Bear, and Baby Bear ain't here.

Their bile is being drained in an unlicensed bushmeat market. I hope you don't mind me taking a brief detour to raise awareness about unlicensed bushmeat markets?

I have to make sure this process is done in the way that is most comfortable for you. Right now I don't know if you are even comfortable with any sort of process occurring at all. I am going to need more information than that. If you don't want any of this, emphatically state it. You are calling the shots. You were always supposed to be the one calling the shots.

It's going to be hard to balance all these disparate elements. The flippant obtuse sense of humor I assume you love so much because I am not handsome at all and have few other positive qualities has to be balanced with the sincerity of my affection for you. You are in a paradoxical place. Some things will make you feel good and feel objectified at the same time. Some of the things you want so badly you also recognize are not good for you.

A simple thing like calling you a hot mess is a choice I agonize over. Hopefully that wasn't too aggressive. ""Room Temperature Mess"" just doesn't have the same passion behind it.

A lot of people would say, ""You shouldn't help her, a therapist should do it"".

Then why didn't a therapist do anything for the past decade? Most therapists simply don't give a shit. It's a job.

Its your choice though. If you have someone better you should immediately let me know.

Until then I will keep typing paragraphs that consist of a single sentence.

Fuck the notion of multiple sentences in a paragraph.

Every sentence should also be a paragraph.

It's called formatting motherfucker.

Learn it.

Be flustered.

You have to convey unambiguous consent that you want that kind of attention to me or I will have to cease all of these attempts very soon. There are lines I can't cross without your unambiguous consent. I don't support the notion that harassment is equivalent to affection. This isn't Gone With The Wind. Frankly my dear, I give a damn.

You can do it. I know you are evasive with words, especially in your current fraught state, but I believe in you. Tell me what is going on.

Close your eyes and become the conduit. Chaos of Forms. This isn't Rome. There are no barbarians at the gate. You are the gate.

Seasons fucking tidings to all the people this letter isn't meant for.

Thanks for reading this. The individual this is for will never come around to believing any of these things as long as she is the only one to hear them. Things need to be witnessed to be true. I could say about a billion things all about how proud I am of her, and how utterly unique she is. But actions speak louder than words and she probably thinks I would be too embarrassed to ever post in a place like this. She has never been publicly recognized for any of the things that make her so special in a way that wasn't objectifying, and it's about time someone does it. I have never been ashamed to say that or been ashamed of her.

And I will say this only once, I would hold my person in higher esteem if English was her native language or she was more like an ""American Girl"".

Hi everyone,

Buy: If you don't have gear to trade, you can take them for any price you think is fair. pickup delivery on you (Delhi, malviya nagar market) minimum 00 Rs

Quantity: Minimum 500g (half a kg) per person. Take as much as you like! Cause they are half kg packet

The Taste: I've tried them-they make a good, solid cup of coffee. Not specialty grade, but definitely decent.

1pjn1zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1pjn1zg/learn_to_enjoy_the_journey_not_just_the/,"Learn to Enjoy the Journey, Not Just the Destination","In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle, focusing solely on our end goals. We often think, “Once I achieve this, I will be happy,” or “When I reach that milestone, everything will be perfect.” However, this mindset can lead to a life where we miss out on the beauty of the present moment. Learning to enjoy the journey, rather than just fixating on the destination, is fundamental to a fulfilling and meaningful life.

https://preview.redd.it/7etrzkk3th6g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d965ae50e4c2fbd7b902d9e5b4a827b39bba07f0



At the heart of this philosophy is the understanding that life is a series of experiences. Each step, each challenge, and each small victory contributes to our growth. Instead of viewing life as a simple path leading to a finish line, we must recognize it for what it truly is: a rich tapestry of experiences that shape who we are. By valuing the lessons learned along the way, we open ourselves up to a more intense appreciation for life itself.



One of the most effective ways to shift our focus is to practice mindfulness. Being present in every moment allows us to savor the experiences life offers. Whether you are embarking on a new project, beginning a new chapter, or simply commuting to work, taking the time to notice your surroundings can transform how you view your journey. Mindfulness sharpens awareness, promoting a deeper connection to both ourselves and the world around us. Each moment contains its own magic, waiting to be discovered.



Setting intentions can also enhance our appreciation of the journey. This practice involves consciously deciding how we want to feel during our daily experiences rather than merely concentrating on the outcomes. When we focus on our intentions, we become more attuned to the sights, sounds, and feelings that accompany our efforts. By affirming that our journey is just as important as our destination, we create a mindset conducive to joy and satisfaction.



Creating rituals can further enrich our experiences. Whether it’s morning coffee, an evening walk, or yoga sessions, establishing moments of joy in your daily routine nurtures a sense of fulfillment. These acts become touchstones, reminding us to pause and celebrate the beauty of our everyday lives. Every ritual offers an opportunity to connect with ourselves and the world, making our journeys more enjoyable.



Embracing a spirit of gratitude can also transform our perspective. Too often, we find ourselves dwelling on what we lack or what is yet to come. Practicing gratitude shifts our focus towards what we have, fostering appreciation for our experiences as they unfold. Keeping a gratitude journal and regularly reflecting on the positive aspects of your journey can cultivate a mindset of abundance. This gratitude enhances our emotional well-being and deepens our enjoyment of every day.



In embracing the journey, we also learn to embrace imperfection. Life is rarely linear, and obstacles will inevitably arise. Instead of viewing challenges as setbacks, we can choose to see them as opportunities for growth. Each misstep holds a lesson, and every challenge can shape us into more resilient individuals. When we accept that imperfections are part of the journey, they no longer hinder our happiness but rather enhance our experiences.



Another key aspect in learning to enjoy the journey lies in connecting with others. Relationships enrich our lives and the experiences we share with friends, family, or colleagues magnify our enjoyment. Engaging in open and supportive conversations can deepen our bonds and lead to a more enriched experience of our journeys. Together, we celebrate victories, navigate challenges, and ultimately create lasting memories that add joy to our lives.



As we learn to enjoy the journey, it’s essential to remember the importance of playfulness. Life doesn’t always have to be serious or about achieving goals. Allowing ourselves time to play, explore, and dream nurtures creativity and encourages spontaneity. This light-hearted approach opens us up to new possibilities, making our journeys exciting and invigorating.



Lastly, cultivating self-compassion is crucial in this process. We must learn to be gentle with ourselves, understanding that it’s okay to make mistakes and stumble along the way. Embracing self-care, taking breaks, and allowing ourselves moments of rest are all vital components of enjoying the journey. Acknowledging that we are in a continuous process of growth encourages an appreciation for both progress and placement on our unique paths.



In conclusion, learning to enjoy the journey rather than solely focusing on the destination invites a transformative shift in perspective. By practicing mindfulness, embracing gratitude, and cultivating supportive relationships, we can enhance our experiences. When we take the time to celebrate each moment, we find joy in the process of living. Life is not merely about arriving at a destination but about cherishing the milestones, memories, and lessons we accumulate along the way. Embrace the journey, and let each step fill you with wonder, excitement, and gratitude.",1,1765423056.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

This post was mainly to rant about how I have been losing interest on being in a relationship, like I do know I am just 24 and I have a whole life ahead of me but for some reason with my old experiences I have been losing that ability of wishing to be in a relationship.

I have had this loneliness period for a while but because of multiple things that have happened in the past few months, irrespective of what I don't have the feeling of even trying to talk to someone.

Rob Norman of Sunshine Community Services of Tulsa is doing a fundraiser to help meet their winter outreach goals, and bring awareness to the homelessness epidemic and the way people in our community are being treated. 

Sunshine is responsible for doing alot of Community outreach, especially with the homeless population! They did a big dinner to pass out to the community this Thanksgiving, along with a clothing drive! They plan on doing the same for Christmas! They do a weekly street clinic to try to provide basic medical needs to those less fortunate in our community. 


This money will help them continue to do street clinics, provide food and nessecities and a place to recieve medical care for alot of people! There will be many ways to donate, and there will be a live stream on Facebook.


Rob will be going up to the roof starting Thursday December 11th and staying until Sunday December 13th!

As they work towards their ambitious goal of 25k, Rob will be able recieve things to keep him warm and fed. 


He will start with nothing but the clothes on his back, and as they work towards their goal, he will recieve things like hand warmers, gloves, warmer socks, a hat, a tent, a sleeping bag, a propane grill, and some canned goods to cook.
You will also be able to make donations to ""buy"" him a cup of coffee, or maybe some lunch!!


If you can't donate, that's cool! But it would mean the world if you could maybe share this with your friends, or post about it on Facebook! 
Or you could even come by and yell for Rob to keep going. 


All proceeds will go to support Sunshine Community Services of Tulsa and their outreach program!

If you would like to make an in person donation, you can message me and I will get you details!!

I (M 18) have been friends with my friend, Amy (F21) for about two years now and our mutual friend Edith (F20) for about one and half. Over this past summer we all got really close to each other, like closer than I have ever been with anyone else. This fall I left to attend college out of state as a freshman and Edith left to return to her school, also out of state.

I know this is a big change but we had gone through it with Edith in the past. However lately I had been feeling like Amy was distancing herself from both of us, messages sent in the group chat or to her directly would go unanswered for days on end and when she did respond she would just say she was busy. I understand how busy life can be but it doesn't take that long to just send a quick message.

I didn't share this because I just thought it was a natural symptom of long distance. I went back for Thanksgiving break and hung out with Edith as if months hadn't passed since the last time we saw each other however when I finally got to see Amy it was at a taproom with her new friends. I was excited to meet Amy's new friends because I assumed if they were anything like Amy they would be great but instead I found myself shunned and pushed aside at the event. (I was the only one not old enough to drink but this separation felt a lot deeper than that)

The final straw came when I sent Amy pictures of a note and old photos of herself that she had put in an envelope and given to me at the start of college. (It was one of those things where you open when you're sad or miss her). I sent her the photo and said I missed her and couldn't wait to see her at Christmas. Three days went by without a response and so I called Edith to talk to her about it. She told me she had been feeling the same way about Amy lately. We agreed to message her. I sent a long winded messages explaining how I felt like we had drifted apart and how I wanted to know if it was something I did and if she even wanted to see me anymore.

Amy responded saying that she did want to see me but felt that I hadn't been valuing her friendship enough recently (by not texting her as much as I used to when I was back home) and so she had decided to cut me off so that she could focus on her own life. Edith got a similar response. We all decided to meet for coffee when we are all back in town but I can't help but feel a little hurt by the whole thing. I didn't realize I hadn't been texting her enough, I would message her when something reminded me of her or when I saw something I thought she would like and responded to all her messages. Amy says she has just been busy but it felt cold and harsh to cut off a two year relationship (one where I had stated how much it meant to me in the past) by just ignoring me completely. Is it wrong of me for not agreeing with her? Am I not seeing another side of the story. Edith agrees with me but she can be hot headed at the time so I'm asking reddit. What should I do?",1,1765422623.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

He owns a law firm, he works quite often. He leaves early so I have a lot of open mornings, normally leaves at 5.

 Our plan was to have babies by now, but I got diagnosed with severe PMDD back in may and my treatment is birth control, so babies have obviously been pushed back.

One of the pieces of advice I was given was to find a hobby that is for me.

I considered a part time job but my man doesn’t think that’s a good idea so not looking for that suggestion.

I’ve been seeing a therapist and she said most of things i described doing revolved around him.. like I like to bake, cook, clean. She said everytime she asks about me, I answer with something related to him so she suggested I find something for me and I have tried but I can’t find anything

Also, I love the hair salon/beauty services already, she said it didn’t count because in the end it’s not for me which I disagree completely, but I want to atleast try and follow what she’s saying …so not looking for any suggestions like that!

I’m just looking for something I can do quietly, at home or at a coffee shop even.

It just has to be simple because I’m not smart at all. I tried crocheting and got very frustrated and gave up🫠

I also tried reading books but I never focused long enough to finish one lol

Does anyone have suggestions on something I can do that’s easy, but fun? I love artsy stuff, fashion, makeup. I love movies but I don’t think I’d go see them alone

We live in Beverly Hills so if you’re nearby and even have a class or group suggestion? I can do anything between 5am-430pm. I can’t technically do evenings if I have to, only saying that because I have to make dinner haha

I know this is a tough thing to answer so feel free to ignore it, I just thought I’d try 

Should also include, I don’t have many friends so stuff to do alone is best!",1,1765422456.0,Advice,5,1.0,False
1pjmtih,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1pjmtih/im_exhausted_and_hes_mad/,I’m exhausted and he’s mad.,"I’m on day 7 of my 9 day work week, reaching almost 84 hours worked in a row. 
Today I REALLY felt the exhaustion, went into work with blood shot eyes, sore throat and raging nausea after I waited 30 minutes for my bus in the snow because it was running late because of the blizzard, had no time to grab a coffee this morning either so I dragged myself around work all day, hitting 25k steps. 
Before I got off work he texted me that he wanted me to buy him a lottery scratcher pack at his work because he couldn’t buy them himself because he’s an employee there, I said sure why not because my bus goes by his work anyway. 
I wait for my bus, it’s freezing rain at this point and he says he’s going on break so he’ll just pick me up, we go into his work and I get him his scratch tickets, after that he wanted me to go wait at the bus stop again because he noticed how tired I was and he wanted me to go home a rest, I leave. 
After one more hour added on to my commute home in the cold freezing weather for some scratch tickets, I make myself a bowl of soup and crawl into bed, finally. 
I ended up falling asleep, he gets home and wakes me up, tells me to get out of bed so we can play GTA. 
I get up, eyes half closed, hair a mess and he says “you don’t have to play you look really tired, it’s okay” and I asked him if he was sure and that I’m sorry I’m not in the mood to play video games. 
He then passive aggressively said “well I was really excited, now I’m frustrated because you didn’t communicate that you didn’t want to play, so yea I’m upset” 
LOOK AT MEEEE, I’m drained as all hell, my whole body hurts because I’ve been working like a dog for the past week and a half I thought it would be easy to assume that I wanna rest went I waddled into your fucking car, eyes still red look completely deflated of all life. 
All this over me not wanting to play GTA tonight because I’m tired. 
I’m working for us, to keep a roof over our head but it’s not appreciated because at the end of the night I didn’t want to sit in front of my computer with him to play a stupid video game. 
I wanted to scream and yell at him because you got to be fucking kidding me, but I have no energy. 
I’m so depressed, I want to get out of this mess. 
I’m 20 and I’m wasting my life and time at work trying to tend to him. But if I leave he’ll have nothing, he’ll be on the streets and I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I took away someone’s home. 
I don’t know what to say, I need help but idk where to start.

1pjmqu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pjmqu0/part_1_im_not_the_only_one_pulling_hairs_from_my/,[Part 1] I'm not the only one pulling hairs from my tongue. I wish I was.,"I was on mute thank god, half-listening to my project manager drone through the backlog, when I felt it.

That familiar tickle.

A hair caught somewhere between my tongue and the roof of my mouth...

\---

**Actually, before you read any further** **- I know**. I know how this will sound. I've been trying to figure out how to write this without sounding like I've completely lost it. But I need to put this somewhere. I need someone else to see it, because right now I'm not sure I trust my own perception of what's happening to me.

I'm 31. Software developer, fully remote since COVID. I live with my girlfriend Mary in a two-bedroom apartment in the suburbs of Columbus. I don't do drugs. I drink maybe twice a month. No history of mental illness, no hallucinations, no neurological issues. I had my wisdom teeth out at 22 and haven't been to a dentist since, which I'm not proud of, but it's relevant because I keep wondering if this is somehow my fault. If I missed something. If something got in.

\---

So anyways. I'd been lazy about shaving - working from home does that. I figured a beard hair had migrated during my morning coffee. I tongued at it absently, trying to work it forward, and when that didn't work, I reached up and pinched it between my thumb and forefinger.

It came out easily. I didn't even look at it - just spit into a tissue, balled it up, and threw it in the trash.

I really, *really* wish I'd looked at that tissue.

The only thing I remember was that my mouth tasted strange afterward. Metallic, like I'd been sucking on a handful of pennies. And something else - an ache deep in my throat - that faded before I could focus on it.

**Five days later:**

I'm in the shower, washing my face when I feel it again. But this time it's further back, almost at the base of my tongue, and when I try to work it forward, it doesn't move.

I spit a few times. Nothing. Hawk up from my throat. Nothing!

So I reach back there with my fingers - which, if you've ever tried to grab something off the back of your own tongue, you know is an exercise in gagging - and I finally manage to pinch it.

It doesn't come out easily.

There's resistance. Not like a hair caught in mucus. Like a hair caught in *skin*. Like pulling a splinter that's gone deep. I had to brace my other hand on the shower wall because the tugging sensation made my eyes water and my throat gag.

When it finally came free, I felt a tiny, sharp pop.

And something else. Something I didn't want to think about. A brief sensation of movement somewhere below my jaw, like a string being plucked.

I held the hair up in front of my face and took a close look at it.

Three inches long. Thin. Almost translucent in the harsh bathroom lighting, but not quite. There was something inside it.

A dark thread running through the center. Thin and delicate, like a vein.

It wasn't a beard hair.

I got out of the shower without drying off, and went straight to the mirror. Opened my mouth wide and pulled my tongue forward with my fingers.

A tiny red dot. Maybe a millimeter across. Right there on the surface of my tongue, about two-thirds of the way back. It looked like a pinprick, as if someone had stuck a needle through from underneath.

I stood there, dripping on the bathmat, staring at my own tongue for probably five minutes.

Then I did what any rational person would do: I Googled it.

""Hair growing from tongue.""

""Hair on tongue causes.""

""Hairy tongue syndrome.""

That last one returned results. It's a real thing, *lingua villosa*, where the papillae overgrow and look kind of hair-like. But every image looked nothing like what I'd pulled out of my mouth. Those were discolored patches. Texture changes. Not individual, distinct strands emerging from a single point.

I found nothing useful.

I told myself it was a fluke. Some kind of weird ingrown hair situation. The human body does strange things sometimes.

I put the strand in a plastic sandwich bag - some instinct toward evidence - and tried to forget about it.

When I checked the bag the next morning, the strand had curled into a tight spiral.

**Day 8**:

Morning coffee. That tickle again. I set my mug down slowly, like if I moved too fast it might burrow deeper.

I reached into my mouth.

Three strands this time.

Three.

One was wiry - thicker than the first, with almost a curl to it. The other two were silk-thin, almost invisible. All three came from different spots on my tongue, and all three left pinprick marks behind.

The metallic taste was stronger this time. It lingered for an hour. Underneath it was something else, something faintly sweet, like fruit just starting to rot.

**Day 9:**

Mary noticed me going to the bathroom a lot. I told her my stomach was bothering me - bad takeout - and she didn't push it.

But she watched me.

We've been together six years and by now, she can tell when I'm hiding something.

That night she asked why I'd bought sandwich bags.

""Meal prep,"" I said.

We don't meal prep.

**Day 10:**

I woke up gagging.

Something was wrapped around my tongue.

I frantically sat up in bed, heart hammering in my chest, and reached into my mouth with shaking fingers. A single strand of hair had wound itself around my tongue while I slept. Twice around, like a loose coil.

When I pulled it free, it was five inches long.

And for the first time I noticed something else.

It was *straight*. Perfectly straight. Not a single wave or curl to it, despite having been wrapped around my tongue for hours.

Hair doesn't do that. Even straightened hair has some memory. Some tendency to curve.

This was rigid. Like a strand of nylon. Like fishing line.

And when I held it up to the light from my phone, the dark thread inside seemed to shift ever so slightly. Just once.

I told myself it was a trick of the light.

That night, I didn't go back to sleep.

**Day 11:**

I couldn't stop running my finger over my tongue.

Something had changed.

The texture was different. Slightly rougher in certain spots, like fine-grit sandpaper.

When I looked in the mirror, I could see them.

Pores. Follicles. Tiny openings scattered across the surface of my tongue like the skin on a plucked chicken.

Some of them had little dark dots in the center. Like something was sitting just beneath the surface.

Waiting.

One of them, near the back, was larger than the others. When I pressed my finger against it, I felt something press back.

**Day 12:**

That's today.

I've pulled six so far, and it's only the afternoon. I'm keeping them in a ziplock bag. Mary's at work, so I don't have to hide in the bathroom. I just sit at my desk, pull one free, drop it in the bag, try to keep working.

The bag has maybe twenty now.

I keep holding it up to the light, studying them. A mess of different lengths, different thicknesses, all knotted together like a nest. But they all have that same rigid quality. That same dark thread running through each of them.

And here's the thing that's really starting to scare me.

When I pull them out now, I feel something else. A tugging sensation deep in my stomach that instantly makes me nauseous. Like there's a thread running from my tongue all the way down into my gut - like whatever's in my mouth is connected to something further inside.

The pain fades fast.

The tugging doesn't.

\---

**I found them by accident.**

I was deep in medical forums looking for weird symptom clusters, rare conditions, anything that might explain this, when I found a post from eight months ago on some obscure health board. The title was generic: ""Unusual lingual symptoms – seeking similar experiences.""

The post was clinical, almost detached. Hair-like growths emerging from the tongue. Pain upon removal. Metallic taste. Gradual development of visible follicles.

It could have been written by me.

Two replies.

The first dismissed it as hairy tongue syndrome.

The second was a single line:

""Check your DMs.""

The original poster replied once: ""Thank you. I'm not alone.""

I created a throwaway and messaged the original poster. Didn't expect a response, as the account had been inactive for months.

Three hours later, I got a DM.

Not from them.

From someone else.

A subreddit link: r/LingualPilosis.

Private community. I had to request access. They asked for a description of my symptoms, photos if I had them, and how long I'd been experiencing them.

I was approved within four hours.

What I didn't notice until later: *they never asked how I found them.*

There are over two hundred of us.

I've spent six hours reading through posts. Timelines. Symptom progressions. Theories.

Some people have been dealing with this for months. One user, u/Creative-Hurry-8431, has been documenting for three years.

Three years.

The progression charts are meticulous.

Phase 1: Sporadic emergence, 1–3 strands daily, easily dismissed.

Phase 2: Increased frequency, visible follicle development, metallic taste.

Phase 3: Rigid strand formation, connective sensations, follicle clustering.

I'm in Phase 2. Maybe early Phase 3.

No one's posted about a Phase 4.

The photos look like mine. The descriptions match exactly. The same rigid strands. The same pinprick marks. The same nauseating tugging when you pull one free.

No one knows what it is. There are some theories: fungal, parasitic, some kind of novel keratin disorder, a covert government conspiracy (there's always that one person it seems), but no one has gotten a doctor to take them seriously. Most have tried. The strands are too thin, too fragile. By the time you get to an appointment, they've dissolved or dried out or just don't look impressive enough.

Creative-Hurry-8431 has been the most persistent. Sent samples to three labs. Two came back inconclusive, citing ""keratin-like protein structure, origin unknown."" The third never responded.

There's something else I noticed.

Every post is calm. Measured. Clinical.

Even the people who've had this for years write like they're filling out a medical questionnaire.

No one seems scared.

I don't know why that bothers me so much.

There's a video call scheduled for Friday night. Ten of us. We're going to chat compare symptoms in real time, see if we notice patterns the text posts might have missed.

I don't know what I'm hoping for.

I'm going to try to nap now. I'll be sure to post an update after the video call on Friday.",2,1765422154.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False

I remember the paper on my kitchen table, the word CANDIDATE glaring up at me. I remember the pen beside it, right where I’d dropped it. I remember washing my hands three times even though there was nothing on them.

I didn’t turn any lights on.

Outside my window, the city went through its normal routine. People argued on sidewalks. A siren in the distance. A couple laughed too loudly as they passed by, drunk, alive and unaware of how easily those two things could separate.

I tried not to think about Eric in the trunk. Whether he was still there. 

You did that, the voice in my head said.

You wrote him into that trunk with your lies.

I pressed my palms into my eyes until colors bloomed behind them.

If I walked away, he would still keep hunting. Prospects, volunteers, whatever he wanted to call them. I wouldn’t stop it.

But now I knew something I hadn’t known before.

I could make it worse.

I could make it happen faster.

Or,

I could try to aim it.

The thought made me want to throw up.

Find someone who deserves it.

Who deserves it?

The drunk who got behind the wheel and drove home? The guy who screams at his girlfriend on the phone and grabs her arm too hard outside a bar? The landlord who ignores the mold in his tenants’ walls? The cop who cuts corners? 

I stood at the window and watched people pass under the streetlight, each of them a file I could open if I wanted to.

For twelve years, I’ve watched people from behind glass, behind lenses, behind legal language. I’ve always been able to tell myself I was neutral and in control.

My phone buzzed.

Unknown:
I’m patient, Alex. But not that patient.

Unknown:
The longer you wait, the more people I look at on my own.

The implication was clear.

Do nothing, and who knows how many end up like Eric.

Act, and at least I could tell myself I’d picked someone who… deserved something.

The word candidate stared up at me from the table.

I picked up the pen.

Outside, on the corner, a man in a suit was yelling into his phone, one hand slicing the air. I’d seen him before, always cutting people off in traffic, always shoving past slower pedestrians. Last week I’d watched him grab a waitress’ wrist when she got his order wrong.

I watched him now, his face twisting, his voice rising, someone on the other end of the line absorbing his words because they had no choice.

I shouldn’t have thought it.

I did anyway.

What about him?

My grip tightened on the pen until it hurt.

The line on the page waited.

CANDIDATE:

I told myself I was just thinking.

Just watching.

Just doing what I always do.

But my hand still moved.

Slowly.

As if someone else were guiding it.

I wrote a name.

And the moment the ink dried, I understood the worst part of all of this.

He hadn’t forced me to.

He’d just given me a reason.

I stared at the word until it blurred. The room felt smaller, like the walls were inching closer one breath at a time. Eventually, I set the pen down and stepped back.

I should have torn it up.

I should have burned it.

Instead, I left it sitting there on the table like evidence at a crime scene.

My phone buzzed again.

This time, it wasn’t Unknown.

Marissa.

For a few seconds, I just watched the screen light up. My thumb hovered over the answer button and didn’t move.

The call went to voicemail.

A notification popped up. One new message.

I told myself not to listen. Not tonight. Not with that paper still drying on the table.

I pressed play anyway.

Her voice came through in a strained whisper, like she was calling from inside a church or a hospital.

“Alex… it’s me. I know you said you’d keep looking into him, I just…”

She took a shaky breath. I could hear something faint in the background. A TV, maybe.

“He’s been different again” she said. “Worse. He left tonight and came back at three in the morning. No laptop. No work bag. He just walked in and..”

She broke off.

“He kissed my forehead and said, ‘Thank you for starting this.’ I don’t know what that means.”

My hand tightened around the phone.

“I asked him what he was talking about” she went on. “He just smiled and said, ‘You made the call. That’s all it ever takes.’”

There was a pause. I heard a soft, distant sound behind her. A melody, maybe. Barely there. My stomach flipped.

“And Alex…” her voice dropped, almost a whimper now, “he was humming again. That same song. The one I told you about at the coffee shop.”

Another pause. Longer this time.

“He said he’s… excited” she whispered. “He hasn’t used that word in days. Not like that. I don’t know what you’ve found, or if you’ve found anything.

Her breathing hitched.

Silence.

When she spoke again, the fear in her voice was no longer just about her husband.

“Please call me back” she said. “I feel like something already started and I missed it.”

The message ended with a soft click.

For a long time, I just stood there in the dark, phone in one hand, the paper on the table in front of me.

I realized my jaw was clenched.

My shoulders were tight.

My throat hurt.

And under all of that, under the ringing in my ears and the pounding in my chest, there was something else.

A sound.

Quiet.

Steady.

Familiar.

It was coming from me.

I was humming.

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, from simple and bitter to excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, primarily because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

I started working for this family about a year and a half ago and it’s my first time being both a nanny & household manager. In my previous nanny families I did a good amount of housework in addition to nannying the children but this family is more intense. The mom of my nanny family has recently quit her job/become a stay at home mom which I have no issue with-we are friendly. However, it seems like no matter what I do/how hard I work I cannot meet the expectations of the parents. When it comes to the kids they have absolutely no complaints and I love the children very much. When it comes to the housework I am struggling more/becoming incredibly burnt out. My duties include keeping all rooms of the house tidy, everybody’s laundry (mom, dad, both kids, towels/sheets/etc), dishes (emptying/loading dishwasher), washing bottles & teethers/toys, organizing & sorting, etc. Basically anything needing to be done around the house I do. The mom & I have monthly check ins because I often request feedback. We recently had a check in that left me feeling pretty discouraged & also in the past six months (especially since mom quit her job) that I don’t want to work a household manager anymore especially because I like working with children/the actual nanny aspect. During our meeting she gave feedback that I am not cleaning fast enough for her liking, she does not like how long it takes me to fold/put away laundry, overall that I just need to be more efficient. She also told me she doesn’t want me to be sitting on the job at all and doesn’t like when I stop what I’m doing to make coffee or anything. I kind of get where she is coming from since they hired me to help but I also just feel like maybe we aren’t the right fit for each other? She also made comments about how she doesn’t like if I come in and seem too tired. She said she wants me at 100% energy all the time. They pay me very well but I am starting to get incredibly burnt out/have become miserable. I feel like they would prefer someone who is more of a housekeeper than both a house manager/nanny? It’s also a little weird to me that neither parent ever does anything around the house-when I am not here on the weekends they don’t do laundry at all and any time I am gone for a period the house falls into a complete mess. I also don’t know if this is normal. I am thinking of going back to working at a daycare (even if it would be a pay cut) because I’m feeling incredibly overwhelmed and like I can’t handle their demands.

1pjmk3q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjmk3q,"All Crops, All Regions, One Satisfying Floating Island Garden Layout! 🌱","*Expansion info is included. Spoiler tagged for those who haven’t unlocked the packs yet.*

**For anyone who didn’t see my** [**original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamlightValley/comments/1naci3t/comment/neslhob/?context=3)**:** I’ve been working on a fully expansion‑ready crop layout inspired by all the gorgeous floating island gardens people have been sharing. Now that Wishblossom Ranch has launched, I’ve updated the entire layout to reflect the confirmed crops and region structure.

**Updated Region Layout:**

* **Left Side:** Base Game (23 crops, including Spring Veg‑EGG‑table)
* **Top Right:** Eternity Isle (12 crops)
* **Bottom Right:** Storybook Vale (12 crops)
* **Top Centre:** Wishblossom Ranch (6 crops)
* **Centre:** Wishing Well, Storage, Crafting Table, etc.
* **Bottom Centre:** Open decor space

Everything still has clean pathways, equal plot counts, and a balanced layout that’s easy to navigate and manage.

**Floating Island Details:**

* The island uses a **65×65 grid**
* The **outer edge path** is **single‑wide**
* The **path between each crop type** is **double‑wide**
* The **central cross‑paths** (both horizontal and vertical) are **triple‑wide** for better symmetry.
* The **second photo includes colour‑coded sections** showing **where each seed is purchased**, making it easier to track which biome or region each crop belongs to.

**Plot Details:**

* Each crop section is a **6×6 plot** (36 total spaces)
* If you’re using the **Ancient Gardener**, each plot effectively becomes **35 usable spaces**
* Keep in mind: you can only place **4 Ancient Gardeners per area**
* The **pumpkin patch** is a special **6×14** section, since pumpkins are known to be one of the most profitable crops and benefit from having a larger dedicated area and it maintains an even area.

1pjmjit,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pjmjit/lotus_water_drops/,Lotus Water Drops,"Just wanted to start a discussion and forgive me if you know of a good post about Lotus water drops. I did use the search feature and found a few mentions but couldn’t find a really solid discussion.

I just ordered some and have had my eye on them for a while. They’ll be here in a few days. I’ve tried making my own coffee water a while back with Epsom salt, baking soda, and calcium chloride. That was the BH recipe, but I went back to Third Wave water because it’s just so easy. With TWW I make 6 gallons out of a five gallon packet. So basically I use about 80% of a full packet/gallon of third wave. I like my coffee. I don’t notice much difference of if I use more or less. The packets just happen to be 6.36G so the math is easy to split them into 6 gallon separate packets. If it’s helpful to know, my taste buds aren’t sophisticated enough to tell the difference if I use a lot of TWW or a little. 

Anyways… these lotus drops seem like an extremely interesting way to really tweak recipes different types of coffee, and I’m just curious if anyone else uses them?

If anyone’s tried these, the one concern I have is scale. With TWW I experience absolutely no scale in my kettle. Lotus includes calcium chloride in its recipes, and scale is my nemesis. But it’s going to be super interesting to be able to super easily see if I truly enjoy that taste. Maybe I’ll just get more comfortable with cleaning my kettle often and being careful with my espresso machine.

I am trying to find a battle cry but my voice is lost in the waves.

My body keeps trying to give out in big ways forcing me tske more breaks than normal and hide in the bathroom to hide emotions I cant risk others seeing.

🎶 Battle Cry by Kyler England.

Someone took a glimmer and smashed it to pieces. They pathologized it and displaced anger. So I’ll share it here if I haven’t already; I don’t remember at this point. I am too tired.

The last couple days, I’ve come out of my apartment and gotten into my car, and the horses come whinnying and running to the fence. I don’t know them. But I took time to pet them the other day. I had wanted to give them carrots or apples, but I don’t know if the owner would be upset. I’ve just been looking out for them.

Someone in my trauma group went off about how I shouldn’t feed horses, etc. — which I haven’t. I’ve been cognizant about asking. But it killed the innocence of creatures loving me for some reason. I deleted all my posts in that trauma group after it happened. She turned my joy into something about her, then projected anger-and shamed  me the connection and joy. I am already holding threads rn emotionally.

 It’s the same group I’m trying to exit, but leaving it triggers a trauma bind and sends me sideways. But I think this may have finally tipped the scales.

It sent me into a really bad place. They already don’t like anything that isn’t a meme, toxic positivity imo, and “teaching stuff” — no real connection or “how one feels” posts.

I’ve struggled with this, because it is a trauma center putting out information on trauma, yet it’s only a “support group.”

I have struggled for two days now to recover from my little glimmer of love being smashed, in a vast field of aloneness and lovelessness, that has now engulfed my fragile life.

I am still struggling in very deep ways. I guess I’m somewhat graced that I already work in a hospital with one job, but I can’t speak about what I’m going through internally, alone.

Therapy tomorrow and Friday, but I am a mess — in a deep well with no bottom — desperate for the pain to stop.

1pjmifn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pjmifn/aita_for_being_completely_done_w_my_husband_and/,AITA for being completely done w my husband and his family?,"I (24F) have been with my husband (27M) for three years, married for one. I’m honestly so upset as I’m typing this it’s hard for me to think straight.

He’s active duty and as such we live a long ways away from any of our family. I’ve made it my goal since getting to our new duty station to prioritize his family as he has a brother with kids and older parents and I don’t have much family to begin with.

Well 2 weeks before thanksgiving his brother (35? M) calls us and wants us to drive to where he is (about 8 hours) and stay for the long weekend. I’m not about last minute plans or staying in other peoples houses but due to other familial concerns I arranged everything as per usual (driving in snow, finances, making it there and back on time, etc.) and we went.

Well his brother conveniently forgets to tell us that they are going over to SOMEONE ELSES house for thanksgiving, people who we’ve never met. Now I’m gonna just preface this by saying, I’m not a weak or whiny person. I can hold my own and take care of myself. But man is his brother a real ass.

Upon my first time meeting me, out in public at a restaurant, he goes out of his way to tell me he only likes to F smaller chicks so he can “bang them up against a wall” - I am plus sized. The first time I ever spoke to this guy on the phone pretty early on in my relationship with my husband, he compared my feelings for his brother to “a dog humping a couch.” There’s a large arc of drama where I spent an entire Christmas alone, my only close family in major surgery, in someone else’s house because it was more important to his brother for my (at the time bf) to be over 1000 miles away and drunk off his rocker for two straight weeks. (I also know this is husband’s fault as well, just have to show what I’m trying to say).

I can go on and on and on. Brother once told us he was coming to stay, so I did all the prep and he flaked last second to go get drunk with his buddies a few towns over (if you can’t tell, he’s a little too fond of alcohol).

Brother once had us do what he called a “fun road trip” but was a 24 hour nightmare where he was hitting himself so hard to try to stay awake that I started crying and begging them to stop the car.

And to top it all off, as if all of this wasn’t bad enough he’s one of the “better than you, coffee bros, uhm actually” types. I don’t like him. I’ve never really liked him. But he’s my husband’s only brother so I’ve tried my best to be a good wife and plan things out and send gifts at Christmas and plan trips, but this has got to be the last straw.

On the drive, brother had called us and was making some distasteful jokes (as per the usual) making sideways comments about “autistic ret*rds” and “touch of the tism” all that crap. Well I am actually autistic, I’ve just never told his side of the family for obvious reasons. I was so fed up I just blurted it out, not mean or anything just matter-of-fact. He doubled down saying “everyone is autistic” and compared me to Chris Chan. No, I’m not joking.

Today he makes a FB post that says how he “forgot to post this picture he took while his brother was visiting.” And it’s the single picture he got of just the two brothers, Conveniently leaving everyone else out, or the fact that I was even there to begin with. I planned the trip. I paid for the trip. I posted his kids on my social media, explaining how I love being an auntie.

So I’m done. I will no longer be the one to remember birthdays, send gifts of any kind, visit for any reason or any length of time. Every single time I do I feel like I spent the entire time getting bullied. I do not care what my husband does, but I can’t put up with it anymore. So, AITA?",49,1765421483.0,AITAH,18,0.96,False

Chris Haddad: Journal Two, Entry One



	I laid in ruins following the aftermath of what was supposed to be a fun outing. My friends all left me, Daniela hated me, and my parents now had a reason to abuse me. I realized that every bad thing that happened to me happened in this town. One hot summer night I decided that enough was enough. I packed two bags and however much cash I could find, and sped off in my car. 

	I was going somewhere, anywhere but here: Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, the farther the better. By the following weekend, I was four hundred miles west in Knoxville. For a week I went around town trying to find work or a place to live, but instead, I found a new vice: **alcohol**.

	While I was walking around in my search for a job, I met an older man named Jonathan who offered to take me drinking. I remember a night of laughing and throwing up until I woke up and was in bed next to a random woman with no clothes on. It was my first time sleeping with a girl and I didn’t even fucking remember it. It felt like someone had stolen my memory and handed me back my body.

	Eventually, I got to my car, said goodbye to Jonathan, and kept driving west. I didn’t have a plan—just a gas station map with circles around cities I’d heard about in songs. Memphis was the first. I slept in a Walmart parking lot and woke up to the sound of a cart slamming into my bumper. I drank warm beer from a stranger’s trunk and watched a blues band play for six people in a bar that smelled like mold and sweat. A woman twice my age tried to sell me pills. I didn’t buy them, but I thought about it.

In Oklahoma City, I got drunk with a group of college kids who thought I was someone named Caleb. I didn’t correct them. They bought me shots. I crashed on their couch and left before sunrise with someone’s hoodie and none of my dignity. I vomited in a bush outside a church and thought maybe I should pray. But I didn’t know how anymore.

By the time I hit Amarillo, I hadn’t slept in two days. My breath smelled like gas station whiskey and nicotine, and I couldn’t tell if the shaking was from withdrawal or exhaustion. I remember staring at a neon motel sign blinking *“VACANCY”* like it was a lifeline. Instead, I spent the night at a house party with kids younger than me, drinking whatever they handed me and making out with a girl whose name I never asked. I stole a deck of cards from their kitchen drawer for no reason other than it made me feel alive to take something.

In Albuquerque, I woke up in a dry fountain with sand in my mouth and sunburn on half my face. I had piss on my jeans and a flyer for a band called “Eternal Malfunction” in my back pocket. A man offered me meth and I almost said yes. Not because I wanted it—but because I wanted to stop *wanting* anything.

By the time I crossed into California, I didn’t even recognize myself in the rearview mirror. I was sleeping in my car behind a 24-hour diner in Riverside, showing up at random bars with a fake smile and a real thirst. I gambled what little money I had left at house games I barely understood, and every time I lost, I felt like I deserved it.

The scariest part wasn’t the hangovers, or the blackouts, or the strangers whose beds I woke up in. It was how normal it all started to feel. Like I’d finally found a rhythm in the chaos. Like I was meant to be this broken. I had long forgotten about the family I left behind—not because I hated them, but because remembering meant feeling, and feeling would have killed me faster than the bottle ever could.

During another one of my benders, I had half a bottle of tequila and a couple sleeping pills. My vision went blurry, I fell back on the floor. 

I woke up choking on air. My throat was dry, my chest was tight, and my arms felt like they were floating. The ceiling above me buzzed with fluorescent lights so blinding it felt like I was being interrogated. I couldn’t move at first. There were wires taped to my arms, an IV in one hand, and my mouth tasted like chemicals and copper.

Everything was white—the walls, the sheets, the machines. I thought maybe I was dead. Or dreaming. Or both.

Then I turned my head and saw them: Aunt Fatima, Uncle Yousef, Tamer, and Fayrouz. Sitting in plastic hospital chairs with wrinkled faces and plastic water bottles clutched too tightly. Their eyes met mine, and I couldn’t tell which was worse: the concern, or the disappointment.

Fatima looked like she’d aged ten years in a night. Her hands were folded in her lap like she was praying, though her lips never moved. Yousef had his arms crossed, jaw clenched like he was trying to swallow every word he wanted to yell. Tamer avoided my eyes, pretending to scroll through his phone, and Fayrouz just stared—like she was trying to recognize the cousin she hadn’t seen since she was nine.

I wanted to say something. Joke. Apologize. Ask what the hell happened. But the only thing I could get out was a dry, cracked whisper: “What… day is it?”

Fatima stood first. She walked over, brushed the sweat-damp hair off my forehead, and kissed it. Her touch was soft, but her eyes were sharp. “It’s Sunday. You’ve been asleep for almost a day.”

I blinked, trying to piece it together. The bottle. The pills. The concrete floor. The lights spinning overhead. The silence.

“You had a seizure,” Yousef said flatly. “You almost died.”

He didn’t say it to punish me. He said it like a fact. Like reading a line from a newspaper. It stung more than if he’d yelled.

“I didn’t mean to…” I mumbled, not even knowing what I was referring to.

“We know,” Fatima said quickly. “We know, habibi. You’re okay now. You’re safe.”

But I didn’t feel safe. I felt hollowed out. Like I had been scraped raw and filled with shame. Like waking up from a nightmare only to realize the nightmare was still happening—just with softer lighting and heart monitors.

They had come all this way for me. People I barely knew anymore. People who owed me nothing. And still, they showed up.

That realization hit harder than the overdose.



	Even though I never told them about what had been going on at home, they understood that I couldn’t go back home. I slept on their couch for two weeks to detox and clean myself up. The first three days were the worst of it where I vomited all over the living room floor and seized two more times. The shaking and insomnia got better but I grew extremely irritable and aggressive, constantly craving what nearly killed me.

	Uncle Yousef would bring me cigarettes to keep my mind away from the bottle, but I needed something else to distract me. Around then I was writing a lot more music and began to take it more seriously than when I was in high school. Tamer would listen in whenever I played, constantly praising my work and pushing me to release my songs.

	With the money I had from working fast food, I bought a microphone and some recording equipment just to mess around with and make a few demos. Tamer had a friend who could mix and master stuff really well and had her work on eight songs I recorded. Before I knew it, I had a small following on streaming services and was making enough money from it to quit my other job. 

	Fatima and Yousef supported me relentlessly through that time and even managed to get me into therapy and back on my medications. They even organized a little get together with family and friends to celebrate my birthday. I was sober, successful, happy, and loved. Something merely a year before, I wouldn’t have been able to imagine it. I was 21 then. As I sat in front of my cake, watching the flames dance atop the candles, I made my wish.

	*I wished I could stay in this moment forever — clean, warm, and wanted…*

	If only that moment could last forever. Not even an hour later, we had gotten in the car to go to a concert when I felt something bad was gonna happen. Just as we pulled out of our neighborhood, a drunk driver T-boned us and I took all the impact. The car slammed into my left side and we flipped. Time felt slowed as the sky became the ground and then went back. The glass tore through my flesh, my airbags rammed into my skull almost as hard as the other car did. 

As we laid on the asphalt I saw a bone sticking out of my thigh, and there was blood everywhere. I broke my femur, cracked three ribs, and sustained a head injury. We all spent a couple days in the hospital. I was the worst off though.

After several surgeries and X-rays and CAT scans, they let me go home. Even though I was getting better, my ribs still hurt like hell. They prescribed me Oxycontin to help with the pain among other things and sent me back with Fatima and Yousef. The pills not only numbed the physical pain, but all of my trauma and guilt I’d buried too.

Over the following weeks, I stayed on the pills even though the pain was gone. By then, my doctor caught on to me and cut me off. I started buying off the street and lying to my therapist that I was sober. It didn't take long for me to pick up the bottle again, pick up the pipe, reuse syringes, and lose all feeling again. 

The benders became a normal occurrence in that house. Fatima got used to me showing up shit faced at four in the morning, Fayrouz and Tamer stopped talking to me, Yousef barely acknowledged that I still lived in his house. They stopped trying to help me because I was beyond helping. I was too far gone. 

One night, I came home from a friend’s house with eight shots and half a gram of cocaine in my system when Yousef snapped.

“Here you are again. Coming home to a family that has done everything they could to save you, but all you do is get high and cause trouble! I love you like a son, but now you have to choose between the drugs or continuing to live under my roof.” He shouted.

“Fuck you, dude.” I muttered.

“You’ve made your choice. Get out of my house right fucking now, Chris! Grab your shit and leave my family!” Yousef ordered.

“Your family?” I asked.

“My family. We may share the same blood, but you’re no longer a part of this house.” He barked. I was filled with a burning rage not aimed at Yousef or Fatima, but at myself for becoming the person I swore to forget.

	I pushed Yousef into the counter and he slapped me across the face. We threw a few punches before I picked up my half empty bottle of Modelo. It was almost as sweaty as I was at that moment. I swung the bottle behind my shoulder and shattered it over my uncle’s bald head. I saw his gaze shift from self-preservation to pure anger. He grabbed me by the throat and pinned me against the wall. 

All the memories rushed back. My great-grandmother’s last words. Sitting by the highway. My dad’s hands. The way Yousef’s grip felt just like his. The way it felt to look death in the eyes and grin. I flailed around like a fish on the pier, awaiting his slow and agonizing death. My right hand brushed across Fatima’s knife box. I grabbed the closest one and gave no thought to my plan. I swung my arm and the knife sliced through his shoulder. I didn't even mean to stab him that hard. It just went in almost like it was butter.

Yousef howled in pain and dropped me from the wall. We both collapsed onto the floor: him and Fatima holding rags to his wound, and myself catching my breath. I grabbed my keys and drove into the night. Nothing sobers you up like sinking a kitchen knife into the man that took you in when you had nowhere else to go. I drove to the airport and booked the first available flight to Beirut the next morning. 

As the plane took off and I soared through the sunrise, I thought about what I had done. I tried to blame other things: my parents, the drugs, the car crash, but I could find no scapegoat to cover my crimes. I ran away. I got addicted. I stabbed Yousef. I made a bomb threat. I ran. I tried to drown it all in a bottle, but the mirror never blinked. I am the villain in my own story. Though I’ll deny it every day I live, I am my own downfall.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**الجبال تدعوني**

**(The Mountains Call Me)**

  
  


Chris Haddad: Journal Two Entry Three



	When I walked out of the airport into the night, the weight of my decision hit me: I was in a new land with new people, a new culture, a language I barely understand, and no family to disappoint. I brought myself here and I was gonna make the best of it. I caught a taxi from the airport to the city center and booked a hotel room for the next two weeks. In the morning I’d find a job and plan my near future. But for now, I needed to sleep.

	The next day, the withdrawals hit me like a sack of bricks. I threw up constantly, I had a blinding headache, and I was shaking so much that I couldn't hold a glass of water without it spilling everywhere. After five days of this mixed with coffee and cigarettes, I got better. I found a construction job that paid just enough to keep me fed and under a roof.

	I came home every night drenched in sweat and dirt for nickels and dimes to keep me housed. It was a form of torture, a one that I created for myself. Maybe if I carried lumber on my shoulders everyday, I would hurt as much as Yousef did the night I ran away. Maybe if I constantly worked, I wouldn't have time to miss the pills or the bottle. Maybe this would slowly kill me, I was fine with this too. 

	After a few months, I left the city. I sold whatever didn’t fit in my backpack, and walked away from my new life again. I headed east towards the mountains, walking for days—searching for food, shelter, or maybe just a place to die. As I travelled from the sea to the mountains, I slowly began to realize that I was the audience of my own story. The path I was destined to traverse was not decided at the bottom of a bottle, or by my own will; it was conceived in these sands long before I ever set foot on this earth. This land was the devil in my blood. After six days, I stumbled across the mountain village of Douma. I checked into a hotel and slept like I did my first night in Beirut.

	The next morning, I went to a small restaurant for breakfast where my life would change for the better. My waitress was a young woman not much older than me named Layla. She was short, tan-skinned, and beautiful. The second I laid eyes on her, I knew she was the one. Layla was an oasis in the desert to me. I came back to that restaurant nearly every day over the next few months. Not because the food was good, but for Layla. We started talking more and more and eventually, I mustered up the courage to ask her out in my rudimentary Arabic. 

	The next night, I came up to her house and met her family. Her father was an older man named Omar who owned the restaurant Layla worked in, her mother was a woman named Nadia who took care of their kids. Layla also had five younger brothers between the ages of four and nineteen. Her family had lived in that house for many generations, since the Ottomans controlled the region. Layla didn’t want to carry on her family legacy, but wanted to own her own restaurant one day.

	We ate dinner and I walked with Layla around the village, stopping in random cafes and corner stores. We sat at a table on the street next to a kind of ice cream parlor. I told her my life story: how I grew up in an abusive household, ran away at sixteen, and struggled with addiction and mental illness. I expected her to turn away and leave me like everyone else had, but she sat and listened and understood.

	“I’m always here for you, Habibi. I promise.” Layla told me. The last person who ever called me “Habibi” was Fatima: the woman whose husband I assaulted, the woman who always walked me to bed when I was too drunk to stand, the woman who loved me regardless of anything that I did. I sobbed uncontrollably at her words. Not tears of sadness or guilt, but tears of joy. 

	We were married the next winter and started our new lives with each other. Layla found a job as a chef at a restaurant back in Beirut and encouraged me to work on my music and art again. We rented an apartment and had our first child, a boy we named Elias, later that year. For my next birthday, we had our new friends and neighbors over. Layla’s parents and brothers even drove up for the weekend to celebrate with us. This was the first birthday I celebrated since before I ran away.

	Layla lit the candles and everyone sang me happy birthday in English. Elias was sitting on my lap smiling at the small flames dancing above the cake. I was surrounded by family and friends: both new and old. They all knew what my life was like before, they all knew why I left America. Yet they all stood there smiling, singing, loving unconditionally. I blew out the candles without making a wish this time, for I had everything I’d ever wanted. Everyone cheered and we started dancing Dabke. I was twenty-five years old and happy again.

**(A Returning American)**

  
  


Chris Haddad: Journal Two, Entry Four



	We’d lived in Beirut for three years by then. We lived in the same apartment, Layla still worked at the same restaurant, and I was still the same young and sober father I had always yearned to be. Though we were doing well for ourselves, my new homeland was plunged into political instability further than before.

	As the three of us were driving home from the movies, we were stopped at a checkpoint controlled by Hezbollah. I knew when they asked to see our papers, I was fucked. Though I had dual U.S. and Lebanese citizenship, I was very obviously a foreigner. Not only a foreigner, but an American. They ripped me from the driver’s seat and began beating me relentlessly. I felt every fist, every club, every rifle butt that hit me. It was at that moment we knew it was time to leave Lebanon for good.

	We moved into the apartment above Omar’s restaurant until we could sort out visas and American citizenship for Layla and Elias. I drove an hour and a half into the city and an hour and a half back nearly every day for weeks until their visas were approved. We flew from Beirut to Los Angeles, the exact flight I took five years earlier when I tried to run from my problems but instead found the solution.

	After spending ten days in another hotel room, we found a small house and we both got jobs at a restaurant nearby. The only catch was that we were two blocks away from Fatima and Yousef’s house. After talking it over with Layla, I decided it was time to try and make amends with the only family I’ve ever had. I walked down the street towards the place I used to call home. The closer I got, the more my heart raced, the more I felt the weight of everything I’d done hit me. I nearly killed my Uncle, I became a kind of burden to them that I never wanted to be.

	The last time I stood on that doorstep was when I tried to escape the monster I used to be, the monster still locked inside of me somewhere. I rang the doorbell and waited to see their faces reflect my guilt like a mirror. The footsteps approached and I heard Yousef’s voice. The deep, yet soothing tone rushed into my ears and made me feel so safe. The door swung open and he looked into my eyes. He didn’t say anything, just started. It was a look of fear,  disappointment, and longing all in one.

	“Hello, son.” he said as a tear rolled down his cheek and into his beard. I broke. I hugged him and sobbed a flood of memories both good and bad, of regrets, of guilt, of love for one’s father. Fatima heard us from the kitchen and ran out to see what was happening. She too joined our embrace and the dams in her eyes breached. 

	They invited me in for dinner and we caught up on everything that happened in the last five years. Tamer was getting his masters, Fayrouz was going to graduate high school next semester, Yousef sold his store and Fatima sold blankets online. I told them about Lebanon, and my new family, and the reason why we left. It was almost as if no time had passed and we were back to when I was barely an adult. 

	The next night, Yousef’s family came over for dinner at our place. Elias loved them so much that he called them Grandma and Grandpa. We ate and talked and danced long into the night like old times. Like my birthday back in Beirut. I’ll never leave this place. Layla and I had two twin girls named Amina and Autumn. By the time I was thirty-four, our family owned a little diner called “Aunt Fatima’s.” We used a lot of Omar and Fatima’s dishes and a few of our own that we cooked up over the years. Layla’s family flew out to see us twice a year and things were great. 

Elias’s birthday came up and everyone gathered at Yousef’s house. Even Tamer had come back from school for the weekend to see us. We all gathered around the table where thirteen years before, I had blown out the candles shaped two and one on my own cake. We all sang to Elias and gave him little gifts: everything from toys to new clothes. His little sisters sat by his sides and he blew out his candles with the most powerful winds he could produce from his eight year old lungs. 

Just then, my cell phone rang. It was a number I didn't recognize but it had the same area code as the town I grew up in. Against my better judgement, I answered.

“Hello?” I asked.

“Hey, Chris,” a woman responded. Her voice was old and shaky, like she’d been crying for some time. I heard the voice was new to me yet had a familiar quality that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.

“It’s me, bud.” she said

My heart froze when she called me that little nickname I hadn't heard since I was in high school.

	Becoming an alcoholic before your eighteenth birthday must be brutal. He was picked up by his family and got a lot better until the car accident. I still can’t decide whether I hate or empathize with what Chris did to his uncle. Fleeing the country was obviously his last resort for escaping his addiction and he found his way back to normalcy there.

	Aside from Yousef and maybe Fatima, Layla had the biggest positive impact on Chris’s life so far. Her family took him in as one of their own immediately and she left the only home she’d ever had so that her husband and son would be safer. She’s the one who helped convince Chris to reconcile with Fatima and Yousef and kept him on the straight and narrow.",3,1765421308.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pjmf7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1pjmf7u/have_i_done_the_right_thing/,Have I done the right thing?,"I apologize right away for the long text. I am 29 years old and a late bloomer (it’s a long story; I mostly worked, helped my family, then fell into depression for 4 years, then gained a lot of weight and didn't feel attractive, so I spent several years losing weight. I only actively started dating in the last 2.5 years, and even then, I’ve only been on 17 dates in total).
I went to a guy’s place for a second date. I liked him; there was chemistry, we were intellectually compatible, we shared a sense of humor, and I was physically attracted to him. He invited me over for dinner the next day. I had never done that before. I lost my virginity last year to a guy I dated for a couple of months, and sex happened once and was very painful. Here, I was in another city, he’s temporarily here from another European country and clearly not looking for a relationship, and I wanted to gain some sexual experience.
But I wanted to have a choice and didn't want him to expect sex, so I said I would only come for dinner. Then sparks flew between us, and I decided to continue. I explained the situation to him, saying I was afraid of pain and asked him to be gentle. He said he would be careful and asked if I was sure, and that we could stop if needed, but I wanted to try.
Having sex was painful, but he was patient, saying it was okay if it didn’t work out. By the way, he was constantly hard; my previous partner could only go once a night, but this guy said he could have sex all night. We slept together 3 times that night; it was painful, but he stopped when it hurt and we took breaks. He comforted me, letting me put my head on his chest. I thought that if I did it more, the pain would pass, but he said I shouldn't have to get used to the pain.
I felt guilty that I was in pain. I wondered if something was wrong with me. I couldn't relax, and I experienced dissociation—my thoughts were somewhere else, not in the moment. We eventually fell asleep. I didn't sleep well, and neither did he, but we hugged in our sleep. He would go to the bathroom, come back, and hug me again.
In the morning, as soon as we woke up, he started kissing my chest and touching me below. The penetration was painful again. He later asked if I wanted to give him a blowjob. I said no, and he said, ""Okay,"" but he had also asked at night, and I had refused. Then I felt guilty that he couldn't penetrate me, but he kept saying, ""It's fine, don't worry."" I tried to give him a handjob, and he said he couldn't finish that way—only sex or a blowjob. I said no, and he suggested anal. I refused. Then he asked if he could cum on my chest.
Honestly, I felt humiliated after that, like I was used... although my friends say it's normal when guys finish on the chest. He then went to shower, said we could have breakfast, and he would walk me to the metro. We discussed why it was painful for me. He said he felt inside that I was tensing up from fear and getting tight. He said it was hard to enter. He said he understood it was difficult for women, especially since I only knew him for the second time, and that coming to his place was ""brave."" He also said that next time, I should ask the guy for his ID, etc.
I was mostly silent or answered briefly. We grabbed coffee to go and walked a little, most of the walk in silence. I felt empty and just wanted to leave quickly. We got to the metro, he kissed me, and we parted ways.
The next day, he texted me, asking, “did you block me? Haha” (because I had deleted him from my contacts, and my profile picture is only visible to contacts, but when he sent the message, the avatar appeared). And then he wrote: “oh I just didn’t see the avatar by the way the exam results came out I passed :)” I replied to him 2.5 hours later, saying something like, ""No, I didn't block you hahaha."" I congratulated him and asked if he was celebrating.
He replied: “insane. oh nvm. i thought its sunda haha."" To the question of why he wasn't celebrating, he answered: “bit tired and just didnt plan anything. if u need a quick schmus u can come over. i`m reeeealll chill today so no big plans for me unfroutunately.”
I found his message about a ""quick schmus"" disrespectful. I was ready for a short-term fling, but not when there's no respect, like I'm just some call girl who should drive an hour to his place after 9 PM for a quick schmus (which implies quick sex) and then leave without even staying the night.
But I'm confused because he acted like a gentleman, was soft with me, and careful—and then this message. I feel used and don't know how to shake this feeling; I don't know what to do with myself. My friends say to use him for sex too, gain experience, but I won't gain experience; I'll gain psychological trauma. I realized that one-night stands and FWB aren't for me; I'm too sensitive for that.",1,1765421230.0,TooAfraidToAsk,3,1.0,False

Hi everyone!

Whispers of Fate merchandise is being sold by many companies so it's often difficult to know where to find things, especially overseas. 

I've put together a guide on where to buy Whispers of Fate merch and what I hope will be an exhaustive list of merchandise. 

Items are listed in categories to make it easy for you to find. There are also photos and links to all pages where you can buy specific items.

Notes:
1) While this is *mostly* complete, there are still a couple of things left to add, e.g. the Puco merchandise and the Cotti Coffee collaboration merchandise. I'll also be adding more private seller options for superbuy and more xiaomang links.

2) I have tried to indicate when something is limited edition, limited time or is sold out. I will try to keep this up to date but if you notice that anything isn't right, please let me know. 

3) There are three main options for buying - Cpop universe, Aliexpress, and Superbuy, in order of most to least pricy. These are listed more generally at the top of the document if you just want to browse directly.

-----

Using Superbuy

Superbuy is a forwarding warehouse that will buy things on your behalf from Chinese sellers and ship them to you. 

Buying directly on Superbuy:

Search directly on superbuy for 水龙吟 or 唐俪辞 to find the items or paste the taobao link into the search bar directly. Then add to your cart and pay.
Be mindful of service fees for certain payment methods!

Using the DIY order option:

For crowdfunded taobao items and xiaomang links you need to use the DIY order under the search and paste the link there. Then fill in the required info and pay. Similar for Xhs links. 

Once your order arrives at the warehouse, you can choose which service you want to use to ship it to yourself, and which items you want shipped together.

A few times this year I have subscribed to LinkedIn Premium. And with that subscription I would have my morning coffee and listen to a LinkedIn Learning session. 

Every couple of days I can finish a course and get a certificate. (Most of the classes I take are an hour or two long.) I noticed that every single time I finished a course and posted the cert to my profile, I would get loads of profile views from executives and recruiters.

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

Anyways, as I was saying, I was wondering about coffee in the LDS. As far as I have seen/read, the Words of Wisdom only forbids “hot drinks” and that has been commonly interpreted as coffee and tea while never actually specify coffee or tea. 
Does that mean that something like cold brew or even an iced coffee or tea be okay within the guidelines of the rules? 
Thanks in advance for the answer and allowing me to gain a little knowledge about something unfamiliar. ",3,1765420221.0,mormon,6,1.0,False
