1licul1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1licul1/first_kit_thoughts/,First kit thoughts,"I‚Äôve spent a fair amount of time decoding all of the jargon and ratios via threads and YouTube and am ready(ish) to take the plunge and buy my first pour over setup. I love the ritual of making tea or French press coffee but it is always for two to three people. For my pour over set, I‚Äôm good with it being for two but it has to fill two decent sized mugs. Here is where I‚Äôve landed. Please advise:

- 1l electric kettle by greater goods - looks fast and efficient with decent price point. 
- Electric scale and timer by Bagail basics 
- Hario V60 size 3 glass coffee dripper
- Hario V60 glass coffee server 1,000ml
- Hario paper filters size 3
- KinGrinder K6 - will have to grind twice each morning while the water heats up to have enough (50 to 60 grams of beans)
- total cost $241

I went back and forth on this setup vs Chemex for size and simplicity for our first pour over. Sounds like the Chemex is more forgiving due to paper filters. I may add their filters to my setup to try both. 

Would love all thoughts and advice for a smooth and successful entry into the world of pour overs!   Thank you.

# Howdy Exofarmers!

In this week's Hotfix, we've added some new content, like an upgraded Seed Extractor in direct response to your feedback wishing for more efficient seed production, but also made various changes and bug fixes! üå±‚öôÔ∏è  
  
**A change we want to highlight** for this hotfix is that we have updated the environment around resource-rich areas, so this may cause floating resources and extra plants in existing saves! We tried our best to avoid your homesteads, but keep your tools ready since there is a possibility that some extra resources might appear in your home! üå≥ü™ö



Check out our chunky fix list below! ‚¨áÔ∏è‚ú®



# üöÄ New Content

* Added the Seed Extractor II blueprint to Milestone 5. The Seed Extractor II creates seeds with 5x the input and output in the same amount of time as the regular Seed Extractor
* Lola now sells Power Cores, which increase Mech Power by 1. (Their cost increases after every purchase)
* Added a ruin close to the starter area (To quicker get introduced to ruins and the artifacts)
* When starting the game for the first time, you will be presented with a short list of important settings



# üîÅ Changes

* Updated environment around resource-rich areas in Outset Grasslands (some floating resource nodes and extra plants may occur in existing save files)
* Overhauled environment in the lower part of Outset Grasslands (some floating resource nodes and extra plants may occur in existing save files)
* Updated environment around resource-rich areas in the mountain (some floating resource nodes and extra plants may occur in existing save files)
* Updated environment outside the Hall of Fame ruin
* Increased drone watering speed by \~30% (in response to player feedback to make the drone feel more rewarding)
* Mech and Exofarmer damage scaling settings are now personal instead of controlled only by the host of a session
* Increased maximum queue in crafting constructs from 10 to 20
* Crafting queues now calculate the amount of time left and progress all queues by that amount of time at day transition
* Slightly increased Floater environment damage so they now break small trees in one hit (Have fun lining those shots up!)
* Moved Barrel construct recipe unlock from Milestone 6 to Milestone 3
* Moved Spike Saw Sweeping Strike Mod Chip recipe award from Milestone 2 to Milestone 1
* Spike Saw Mk. 1 is no longer listed as a reward for Milestone 1 (since you already have it)
* Changed the categorization of several decorations to be more intuitive
* Reduced the cost of several constructs
* Reordered available deliveries in the Resource Delivery Cannon menu to be closer to the expected order of discovery
* Made other players' Mechs look less floaty as they move around
* Honeybottle growth time increased from 3 to 4 days (existing saves with fully grown honeybottles may find them reverted to the growing stage, but they will be fully grown the next day instead)
* Mech tools are no longer unequipped from the Mech model when docked (to allow tool repair while docked)
* Added more resources all over the map and replaced resources that were floating in the air or were positioned weirdly
* Moved some existing nodes further away from mountain sides for easier extraction
* The wall preventing players from entering the ??? area is now visible from further away
* Increased the weight of several items that weighed less than 0.1 units and were incorrectly displayed as weightless
* Increased the Stone drop rate from Gravelgourds, upping the average yield by \~50%
* Added Spirepot Tree Sprouts to Lola's store
* Added some more Unstuck Safespot locations in Hexagon Valley
* Added a way to more easily get out of the Landing Pad and Loading Dock ruins in case you went in there without your Mech
* Removed a small beach where it was easy to get softlocked without upgrades
* Adjusted sun rotation
* Adjusted the color of the sky and grass
* Adjusted fog density and color during dusk/dawn
* Improved the collision of Ulf's house to make building his decorations easier
* Reduced Fuel Efficiency Mod Chip Lv 1 & Lv 2 power costs to 0, max fuel efficiency is capped at 90%
* Added a tooltip to explain how to select Mech Transform Modes



# ü™≤ Bug Fixes

* Fixed various crashes
* Drone fuel consumption reduced by 75% (Drones were using much more fuel than intended)
* Fixed issue where you were unable to find all artifacts for the Landing Pad and Loading Dock ruins
* Fixed a state that could leave the exofarmer without tools after a save file crash
* Lost Inventory can no longer spawn in water after exofarmer getting knocked out
* The Exofarmer now teleports to their mech when falling into the void inside the Vault
* Fixed issue where ranch animals would sometimes become ""Sleeping Beauty"" and sleep forever
* Fixed client seeing other Mechs sliding around after they had transformed back into Biped mode from another mode
* Fixed issue where player-made paths would sometimes fail to load for Clients
* Fixed a couple of issues that caused performance stutters for Clients when walking away from large groups of constructs
* Fixed an issue that caused eggs to not spawn correctly in multiplayer
* Fixed issue where ""Drink Coffee"" emote would not work properly in Photo Mode
* Fixed issue where Wheat Trophies would turn into Polyberry Trophies after saving and loading the game
* Crystal Shards' final delivery now correctly requires 100 items instead of only 10
* Resources shouldn't respawn incorrectly after a save and load
* Most likely fixed the issue where Behemoth would sometimes stop spawning
* Fixed issue where the textures of the flying Behemoth would often be very blurry
* Fixed issue where Phosphoric and Nitrogenic Fertilizer had the Potassic Fertilizer icon
* Villagers can no longer get stuck inside their lander if you're far away when they arrive
* Fixed the locations of the inspection points in the Loading Dock that were floating in the air or had obscured vision
* Fixed issue where coziness buffs would stop saving properly after 30 days of playtime
* Fixed issue where Floaters would deal a lot more damage to the player than intended
* Plants far away should now respawn as intended
* Adjusted collision on Hexagon cliff and Alien Fence to easier to step up as the Exofarmer
* Fixed issue where some models were slightly floating in the Loading Dock ruins



Next month, we are slowing down with hotfixes as many of us are starting to take some well-deserved time off for summer! But we always aim to have some of our cool team members available, so please share feedback or bugs you encounter. üêõ

Rarely drink alcohol and am tracking calories to little success.

I have 2 questions. 

1. I am on a cut now and hungry AF 24/7. My BF% doesn't seem to have dropped this month suggesting i'm not in deficit. But i'm under 2k calories a day and already could eat the plate the food is put on. 
Any ways to suppress hunger to make a further drop to maybe 1900 to test the waters less painful? 
My plate is already 1/2 veggies or fruit, i am drinking black coffee and also making sure to keep my water intake well up. But further ideas would be great. I have the appetite to eat 3-3.5k calories a day clean without blinking.

2. I have Bi-annual exams that ofc spike cortisol through the roof, somewhat lock me to a desk to revise and in honesty I perform better in the exams when I stop counting the calories and instead just up the portion sizes so i can focus on the task at hand without feeling hungry. It consistently resets progress since training has to be a lower priority and diet control is more difficult. Any suggestions on how I could just maintain in exam season rather than regress? I'm not against putting the time in to plan out my exam sittings say 2 months out. ",1,1750672889.0,gymadvice,0,1.0,False

That's not a big issue for me, as I don't share them with anyone. But recently I also tried to make a song and made it sung by Ai (I used Suno app) and asked my friends to review it, but their words are ""Swear it is the worst song I have ever heard"" :(

I spent a lot of time making it, and I think it's not that bad... ok, I don't know, can you guys tell me, is it that bad? I named it ""You Born, You die"".

\~ You born,You die

You born, you cry,

You slay like a spy.

You roll and crawl,

Then you go outside, embrace your pride.

Like a charm you baby, you gotta right,

You walk like a scarecrow,

You talk with no-flow,

When you cry, it sounds like a crow-crow-crow.

(Oh ho ohh ho)

You amaze,

Make a blissed phase,

Then you grow high with high shy ‚Äî Shy to cry.

You blink and you run,

Then school ain‚Äôt so fun.

You scribble your name,

Try fortune and fame.

Teenage kicks in, with pimples and pride,

You laugh in your lows, then secretly hide.

Your dreams shout loud, but your voice is shy,

You say you're okay, but don‚Äôt know why.

You dress like a rebel, fail a few tries,

Fall in fake love, then break with cries.

You dance through nights, with hopes so sly,

You fall, you fly, you ask the sky.

Then jobs knock doors, but none stay long,

You wear a tie, but don‚Äôt feel strong.

Coffee and clocks, rent on your mind,

Success feels close, but hard to find.

You marry with cake, and shaky knees,

Make silly vows, like ‚Äúlove and peace.‚Äù

You smile in frames, forget to feel,

Some days are fake, some strangely real.

You age like a meme, your hair says ‚Äúbye,‚Äù

But still chase goals you don‚Äôt know why.

You shout at bills, and sigh at news,

You miss old songs, worn-out shoes.

At forty-nine, you're tired, but bold,

Your laughter lines are stories told.

Then one dull day, on a rainy drive,

A twist of fate ‚Äî you don‚Äôt survive.

Your phone still buzzes, the world walks by,

But you‚Äôre the pause beneath the sky.

You born, you cry,

You laugh, you lie,

You love, you try,

You born, you die.

Hotels üè®: 1 night in Edinburgh @ Point A Edinburgh üí∞1200/night
5 nights in London @ Mercure Earls Court üí∞1000/night 

TrainüöÑ: I highly recommend purchasing the Two Together Railcard (¬£35) in advance through Trainpal for discounted fares. As shown in Figure 2, it seems to offer a 20% discount on each train ticket. When booking, you can use the code: „ÄêRICH211„Äëto receive an additional 5% off, which can be stacked with the Railcard discount!

6.13 Flight took off at 1:25 AM Beijing time, landed at Gatwick around 6 AM London time. Cleared customs + grabbed luggage in 40 mins, then hopped on the shuttle train to South Terminal. Caught the 7:05 train to St Pancras, took 44 mins, arrived at 8. Grabbed brekkie at Costa, chilled a bit. Boarded the King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverley at 9, arrived at 13:22. 

Took a cab to the hotel, dropped bags + waited for gf to do her makeup. Headed out around 4, Ubered straight to Calton Hill. Snapped some pics, strolled down Princes Street. Dinner at Markars Mash, the famous Scottish spot. Three dishes for ¬£28 (pic 3). Tbh, it's worth a try but don‚Äôt expect too much. Dead tired from all the travel, so crashed right after. üò¥

6.14 Rainy day. Hit up Tani Modi at 9:30 AM for our first full English brekkie in the UK (pic 4). Black pudding was a bit dry, but gf said the eggs Benedict were on point. ¬£28 for two. Walked to the National Museum of Scotland (no booking needed, just walk in). Checked out Dolly the sheep. Then chilled at Origin Coffee nearby (pic 5). Strolled to Victoria Street, lunch at Oink for a pork burger (pic 6). Apple sauce + crispy pork skin = yum. After lunch, did some citywalking around Royal Mile + Princes Street, picked up some souvenirs. 

Hopped on the train back to London around 3 PM (‚ö†Ô∏è LNER trains don‚Äôt have a dining car, waited 3+ hours for the trolley in Coach A‚Ä¶ pro tip: bring snacks + water). Arrived at King‚Äôs Cross at 8 PM, took the tube back to the hotel. First London meal: Jollibee + pizza via Deliveroo (pic 7). üçï

So at the end of the day when I was leaving with Z(at that time she was in washroom), I saw A with her other friend(who had a boyfriend, let‚Äôs call her B), they were around 50m far from me, and when I looked at them, I realised that they were looking towards me, and coming here and wondering why they are coming my way cause I just knew them for a day and that too cause of my friend.
They came directly towards me, and B asked for my number while A was looking at me. My brain stopped braining, thinking why this girl who already had a bf wants my number? Then i asked ‚Äúwhy? What happened?‚Äù 
She said something which I couldn‚Äôt hear properly as my brain stopped braining and I thought that A wants my number but couldn‚Äôt ask directly and B is asking for her.

So before B could answer as to why she wanted my number which I obviously didn‚Äôt hear and before she finishes I started saying the digits of my number. She took it and left.

And here I was, in a bliss as to how it feels when a girl, especially someone you are interested in, asks for your number(indirectly, according to me). I can‚Äôt express the feelings I was going through, it felt like I have unlocked another level of happiness known to mankind. From that point, till next morning, I was in heaven, just pure eternal heaven and bliss, blushing for no reason, waiting for her text. Until next morning‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Next morning I was still on cloud 9, and I told Z that this an all happened and she started to laugh, badly, like real bad and I realised that something had gone wrong.
She told me that yesterday when we went for snacks and I paid, and B took my number cause she wanted to return the amount for it. 

I asked how did you knew. She said cause the number I gave, they typed it wrong and they sent the money to Z to give it back to me. 

Looks like when I asked why she wanted my number and I didn‚Äôt hear it, she was saying the same thing and if I had listened then this would have spared me the embarrassment I was going through now. Z said that don‚Äôt feel embarrassed, all men are like this.

My eternal happiness and bliss was gone. It was short lived and now I‚Äôm spending the whole day in embarrassment and thinking are Men really that stupid???",3,1750672772.0,delhi,2,1.0,False

I found it interesting how she wanted to do that while hardly knowing anything about me, but I'm fine with hanging out with new friends to get to know them better.

Honestly, we didn't really click. She's an good person, but we didn't have much in common and she's not the type of person I generally spend time with. 

She expressed that she wanted to go out again. Normally, I don't jump to conclusions just like that, but the way I see it she might want to be more than friends.

I kindly let her know that I wasn't really in the mood to go out, and also didn't re-schedule, leaving it as is. (Hoping she would get the hint that I'm not interested)

She went silent for a few weeks and now she messaged me again to go out sometime.

She hasn't specifically stated that she's romantically interested in me so I can't just tell her that I don't have the same feelings, I don't wanna be the guy who thinks every girl he meets is into him.

But I also do not know how to kindly tell her that I'm not interested in hanging out with her at all.  
How do I get out of this situation without upsetting anyone?

I have 2 cats (1yo and 9yo)I live alone (in EU) after divorcing and I have a very demanding job, 12-hour shifts and I almost always work OT because I'm trying to save for my life dreams which are travel to other European countries by taking short trips maybe a week or 2 and also for buying a house in a few years after traveling to the places I dream about (it's not too much as I'm not interested in long trips to south America or SEA and stuff). Every month I end up working 220-250 hours and I have very few friends and my social life is almost non existent.

I'm having an average of 14 days off per month (but with the OT they can be even less, I'll work my a** of in July so I'll only have 5 days off that month) and I realize I'm just keeping my cats with the basic needs because the days I work are basically sleep, wake up, quick shower, quick coffee, quick meal, drive 30 minutes to work, work 12 hours, drive 30 minutes back home, repeat. 

And on the days off I try to keep up with the chores (cleaning, meal prep, laundry, grocery shopping, cleaning litter boxes, etc) and as I've been struggling with very bad depression, I'm trying to meet more people and spend some time outside home, and of course recover energy by sleeping more hours. 
I hired a cleaner a couple of times because some months I'm working so much that I don't have the time and energy to do the stuff myself. 
I went on 2 short trips this year (5 days max) and I'm planning 2 more short trips and fortunately a neighbor can check on the cats. The thing is that one of those trips is for 20 days but I know that my neighbor will be there to take a look at them. 

The thing is that I came to a conclusion that I'm not giving the boys the attention they deserve, I only keep them fed, provide fresh water and keep the litter boxes clean, that's it. I don't often play with them or spend more time with them. My ex partner is reminding me that I leave them too much time alone and neglect them and that's wrecking me. 
Sometimes I think about rehoming them but that goes against my principles because if you adopt an animal is a life commitment and getting rid of them is an easy way to get out of the responsibility. 

I don't know what to do. Just the idea of giving up on them is making me cry but I think my ex is right. FWIW, they love the boys, although they are not visiting them often tho because I don't let them in the apartment while I'm not there, and for the record I'm not at home all the time.

1liciua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1liciua/is_it_worth_it/,Is it worth it?,"We have been together for 2years and 8 months, he‚Äôs 24 now and I‚Äôm 23 about to be 24. 
Context:
He moved out with his ex girlfriend before at 18 and he moved back in with his dad after as he couldn‚Äôt afford to be on his own after not even a year. He blew up because I now know he bottled everything up and resented her and decided to breakup with her and the day after he went to work and when he got back, everything was gone because she moved out while he was gone. 

My issues:
He isn‚Äôt financially stable, he‚Äôs blown ¬£3500 (that‚Äôs given to him by parents to help him complete a course for his second career) on random things that don‚Äôt make sense, he has ¬£700 LEGO on finance he didn‚Äôt tell me about until couple weeks later on his birthday. He was great before but a couple months ago we hit a point of constantly arguing and then a few weeks ago it all snapped, I felt him be off with me, turns out he was slowly giving up. But, he admitted his last relationship he wasn‚Äôt good with communication, he said he‚Äôs been bottling all of the things he‚Äôs got problems with in our relationship and then he just blew up and apparently that‚Äôs what happened with his ex. I said it wasn‚Äôt fair he‚Äôs got resentment towards me due to not airing his views. He said he kept it to himself to protect my feelings and not wanting arguments. There‚Äôs a few things too as examples:
He loves skiing, I‚Äôve never ski before but offered to learn to go on the holidays he likes but I hate the idea staying at that resort due to having to share with a stranger and he doesn‚Äôt see the issue (his dad his highly religious and it‚Äôs a resort that doesn‚Äôt let you share a room unless you‚Äôre married) 
He wants to go on trips with friends to watch sport but doesn‚Äôt want a summer holiday even though it would help me and I love them and he seemed to like the last one
He‚Äôs had to borrow money off me until payday even though I‚Äôm unemployed due to mental illness and trying my best
He didn‚Äôt ask me how my doctors appointment went about it all
Through our relationship I‚Äôve had to tell him to brush his teeth in the morning when he‚Äôs up really early. He said he‚Äôs not ready to move out due to his past (which I get) with ex and when we talked about him not washing his dishes and not a clean room and hardly changing bed sheets he said it reminded him of his ex and how they went. I feel a shift in his energy again even though he went back to normal after a few chats I had to initiate first. Without them I don‚Äôt think we would be together anymore. His actions are confusing and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my anxiety but it doesn‚Äôt feel right. After a big talk with me crying the next day he fetched yogurts for an older woman at work to help her before work and got himself coffee with my membership card. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do

Yesterday, I found mould In tzatziki he left in his room growing spores, plates and everything. 

I want to say, I have admitted my wrongs in this relationship, I‚Äôm trying my best be better and I am trying since our argument. I‚Äôve even spent money to feed him when he can‚Äôt afford it, made food for him and took it to his work, he couldn‚Äôt even wash the dish properly to give it me back, more effort in my looks, trying my best (I‚Äôve have adhd, anxiety & depression and really struggle with emotional dis regulation) I have done these things before. He used to be so romantic and loving. He‚Äôs now great with me again, I‚Äôm so confused.

I hope everyone is having a great start to their week! I‚Äôve been feeling a bit lonely today, and I‚Äôve had a long, sleepless night, so I thought I‚Äôd once again post on r4r :)

I suppose you might wish to know a bit about me. I am really introverted (INFP for those of you keeping score at home), but I‚Äôm told I don‚Äôt shut up once I‚Äôm comfortable with you. My love language is sharing music :) I love having deep conversations over coffee or tea. 

I enjoy reading. History, (particularly U.S. and modern European history), philosophy (I enjoy dabbling in existentialism in particular), and literature (Kafka, Chekhov, Milan Kundera, and Raymond Carver are among my favorite writers). I love film, especially foreign film and films that are a bit more cerebral or absurd. Wes Anderson, Charlie Kauffman, the Coen brothers, and Ingmar Bergman are among my favorites. I often find meaning in music. Cloud Cult has been especially comforting for me this year. I also love Bright Eyes, the National, Okkervil River, and Leonard Cohen‚Äîto name a few. I also love writing poetry and short stories.

Physically, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù. I have green eyes and brown hair. I‚Äôm a normal weight. I like to be active. My favorite form of exercise is taking long walks. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone who might be open to a relationship at some point. These things take time, so I‚Äôm not looking to rush things. I should note it might take time for me to be able to relocate. I‚Äôm looking for someone who loves having deep conversations. Someone who wants to explore art museums or discussing their favorite literature or philosophy. Someone I can share music with and help each other through our days. Building an emotional connection is important to me. 

I‚Äôm in the CST time zone, but I work really early hours, meaning I‚Äôm up in the middle of the night sometimes (insomnia is such a joyous thing, isn‚Äôt it?). So the time difference isn‚Äôt always a problem for me if you think we might hit it off. I am open to voice and video chatting too once we are comfortable with each other. And I‚Äôm willing to exchange SFW pictures once we are both comfortable. Thanks for reading. I hope everyone finds their person soon. I know how lonely this process can be.

1licfpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1licfpk/trying_to_overcome_a_crush/,Trying to overcome a crush,"I've met my crush 3 years ago. I have a lot of issues with my teeth which require an extensive treatment plan that is spanning on a couple of years. My crush is my dentist. 

It wasn't a ""love at first sight"" kind of thing. For the first few months we just had a professional relationships, making small chat and stuff. She was very caring and focused, but in a professional way. Like making sure nothing hurts, calling me to make sure everything is alright after a big procedure. Normal stuff.

After a few months of going to her almost weekly, we started talking more, chatting about music and life and stuff. We would usually chat 10 minutes before the appointment and just generally have a very friendly attitude. She would make silly/unprofessional jokes and generally treat me like a friend.

We added eachother on social media and started talking. While nothing flirty we talked about personal stuff, sex, depression etc. 
We chatted a few times with video and talked for a couple of hours. That was sometime around in 2023. That was when I started having a crush on her. She's also the same age as me and she's single.

I kept going to my appointments at her, my treatment progressed normally. In the summer of 2023 she started inviting me to hangout, usually with one or more of her friends. She invited me to a concert once but I didn't go. Than she invited me to smoke weed at her place with one of her friends. I expalined to her that I usually don't smoke because I tend to get very anxious and paranoic but I accepted.

I felt good smoking with her at her place. Her friend was really nice and chill and I generally had a good evening.

A couple of weeks after that, after an appointment at her cabinet, she invited me again to her place to smoke, and her friend was to join as a bit later on. I don't know what was different this time, maybe because we also talking about past relationship and guys that she dated recently, but I felt more anxious. I ended up in a panic attack from the weed, and while she was trying to calm me down she asked me if I knew what triggered this panic attack. 

I answered that I think I know why I got so anxious this time, and I told her that I have a crush on her and I feel guilty not telling her that, since I feel like I'm deceiving her by wanting more than a friendship from her. 

She told me that she appreciates me telling her that but she's not dating pacients. I layed down for a bit and went home after that.

The next day we talked about it for a bit. She told me she respects me for having the courage to tell her that and hopes we can still be friends. I told her that I'm responsible for my own feelings and she should not worry about that, we will still be friends and she'll still be my doctor.

Now, while I understand the ""Not dating patients"" response, I do think it's a bit of BS. She told me she got as patients guys that she went on dates from tinder and bumble. And if she really wanted to maintain a professional relationship she wouldn't have invited me to smoke weed with her. 

Anyway, while I felt terrible to be rejected, I guess I never fully processed it. This happened in september of 2023 and at that time I was somewhat okey from a mental health POV. I was seeing my friends, going out, going on dates. I guess I distracted myself from her.

At the same time, in the back of my head, I always thought of it as ""I'm sure when I'll do X, Y and Z she'll want to date me"". Where xyz are things like getting in better shape, having a more active life etc. 

In 2004 I started to distance from her a bit, even though it was hard. I stopped sending her reels on instagram and when she would send me something I would not develop a full conversation. Stuff like she would send me a real at 1Am and I would send her one word message back. 

In the summer of 2024 I had some issues with my family which made me spiral into a depressive episode. In december 2024 I stopped taking my meds and stopped seeing my therapist. I had a really rough 2025 so far. In this time I kinda forgot about my crush on her. I wasn't thinking about her daily and didn't think of her so intensily. 

This changed 3 months ago when I was at an appointment with her, when she asked me if everything is okey since she can tell that I'm not my usual self. I explained to her in broad strokes with what I'm dealing with and she told me to reach out to her, to talk and go out. She always put importance on mental health and was very supportive with me going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. She asked me if I'm mad at her since she noticed I haven't texted her in a while. I explained to her that I'm not mad at her, I'm just going through some stuff.

Anyway, since then I think about her daily and her rejection hurts like never before. Random stuff that she said to me, like mentioning dates she's been on, hurth me so much more than ever. 

I know that it's probably a combination of me being in a depression spiral, isolating myself, not taking my meds, not seeing a therapist etc. But everything I think about the fact that I'm not good enough for her. And what's worst, even if she wanted to go out right now with me, I know that it would end up badly since I'm in such a bad mess with my mental health. 

I get this feelings of jealously that I didn't had before. Like my mind repeats stuff like ""She didn't want to give you a chance, not even grab a coffee together, but she dates random guys all the time"". I daily get these waves of sadness and I don't know how to stop them. 

I stopped texting her stuff that's not related to dentistry, but it doesn't seem to help.

And yes, I know that the best solution is to find another dentist, but I can't really do that. I paid in advance for my treatment, I have around 6k‚Ç¨ paid in advance and I don't want to put her in a place in which she needs to reimburse me, since that might really jeopardize her business.

So yeah, thanks if you read all this out, it's the first time I write it all out, or really, share it all with someone",1,1750671977.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn‚Äôt understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he‚Äôd decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he‚Äôd been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he‚Äôd catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You‚Äôd think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He‚Äôd been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she‚Äôd worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn‚Äôt pay her so well, or if she didn‚Äôt need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn‚Äôt true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston‚Äôs were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fianc√© Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn‚Äôt adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn‚Äôt her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with‚Ä¶ just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father‚Äôs baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn‚Äôt remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

‚ÄúPlease be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,‚Äù she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan‚Äôs bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she‚Äôd have to pass the other doors.

That‚Äôs when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn‚Äôt a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúLaura, you‚Äôre so fucking hot,‚Äù Dan‚Äôs voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair‚Äôs stomach lurched.

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan‚Äôs cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan‚Äôs hands gripped Laura‚Äôs waist and ass, guiding her movements.

‚ÄúErr, yes, fuck me harder,‚Äù Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan‚Äôs grip tightened on Laura‚Äôs ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair‚Äôs fianc√©.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura‚Äôs father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura‚Äôs mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He‚Äôd called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan‚Äôs mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn‚Äôt pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen it. She didn‚Äôt want Dan anymore‚Ä¶ not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

‚ÄúLaura, you are so goddamn tight,‚Äù Dan groaned, arching his back.

‚ÄúIs my pussy better than Blair‚Äôs?‚Äù Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair‚Äôs heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn‚Äôt even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn‚Äôt that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

‚ÄúWhile you two finish up, should I cook dinner?‚Äù

# Chapter Two

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He‚Äôd been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn‚Äôt known of Blair‚Äôs presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

‚ÄúNo thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.‚Äù Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

‚ÄúBlair! What are you doing home today?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn‚Äôt be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.‚Äù

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn‚Äôt felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn‚Äôt needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn‚Äôt use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn‚Äôt joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn‚Äôt like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ‚ÄúBaby..‚Äù

Blair took a step back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch me?‚Äù Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn‚Äôt be?

‚ÄúYou have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.‚Äù Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn‚Äôt sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

‚ÄúDo you know Dan? It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ‚ÄúThis one time was all it took.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.‚Äù Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ‚ÄúPlease, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.‚Äù

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, you dumb bitch.‚Äù Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ‚ÄúShe is lying.‚Äù

Blair shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It only took the one time Dan.‚Äù She nudged him with the baseball bat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.‚Äù Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. ‚ÄúIf you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?‚Äù Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

‚ÄúYou stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn‚Äôt coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan‚Äôs insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ‚ÄúYou set me up, didn‚Äôt you? You knew she was coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn‚Äôt want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn‚Äôt an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn‚Äôt want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin‚Äôs sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThere are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs voice was gentle, like he‚Äôd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn‚Äôt like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just let me talk to you.‚Äù

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúDo I look like a woman who just found out her fianc√© is screwing her cousin?‚Äù

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ‚ÄúYour eyes are a little red, honey, but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

‚ÄúMiss Warner, Can I help you?‚Äù Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn‚Äôt need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ‚ÄúThanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?‚Äù She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Warner.‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs eyes darted to the bat again.

‚ÄúBlair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?‚Äù Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn‚Äôt just been kind. She really didn‚Äôt look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn‚Äôt see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn‚Äôt much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman‚Äôs schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn‚Äôt have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fianc√© shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn‚Äôt recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ‚ÄúHey, Blair. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in today.‚Äù

Blair smiled. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning to be, but I figured I‚Äôd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?‚Äù

Kara shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.‚Äù

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn‚Äôt have to face him just yet.

‚ÄúThanks, Kara.‚Äù

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn‚Äôt hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair‚Äôs aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn‚Äôt been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn‚Äôt when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn‚Äôt big. She hadn‚Äôt wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair‚Äôs ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman‚Äôs office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn‚Äôt much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget intimidating.‚Äù Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ‚ÄúHoly shit, this shit burns.‚Äù Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn‚Äôt help. But it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn‚Äôt call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn‚Äôt been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton‚Äôs baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn‚Äôt big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn‚Äôt even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman‚Äôs desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

‚ÄúRoman please.‚Äù Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman‚Äôs little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúRoman isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Blair put a hand on Roman‚Äôs desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Claire asked.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know?‚Äù Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

‚ÄúYou are his secretary.‚Äù Blair could hear the anger in the other woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not his keeper and I sure as hell don‚Äôt own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.‚Äù Blair was over this conversation.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt answering his mobile hasn‚Äôt for days.‚Äù Claire whined.

Blair‚Äôs lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman‚Äôs move. He didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn‚Äôt help the next words. ‚ÄúWell, one of two things has happened. Either you‚Äôre about to get dumped, or he‚Äôs dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.‚Äù

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, let‚Äôs be honest. He‚Äôs not marriage material. Find someone new.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn‚Äôt an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn‚Äôt something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn‚Äôt know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine. If you want one, go find your own.‚Äù

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

‚ÄúRoman?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he said, his voice unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, slurring slightly, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs... pretty obvious. As you can see, I‚Äôm getting shit-faced.‚Äù She reached for the bottle. ‚ÄúNow give it back so I can finish the job.‚Äù

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù

Blair frowned. ‚ÄúYou know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre going to regret this tomorrow.‚Äù

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,‚Äù Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. ‚ÄúI think I should get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äô want it.‚Äù Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. ‚ÄúI want... a man that ain‚Äôt a cheatin‚Äô rat.‚Äù Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. ‚ÄúDid you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?‚Äù

She‚Äôd met Jessica once. It hadn‚Äôt been a pleasant experience.

Roman‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but his voice softened. ‚ÄúNot all men cheat, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-why‚Äôd she leave you then?‚Äù Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,‚Äù Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. ‚ÄúNot all of them have to do with cheating on the man‚Äôs part.‚Äù

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. ‚ÄúShe cheated on you?‚Äù she whispered, as if it were some great secret. ‚ÄúWas she an idiot?‚Äù

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she‚Äôd ever been interested before. She‚Äôd always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. ‚ÄúI worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.‚Äù

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. ‚ÄúThass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.‚Äù She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. ‚ÄúShould get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‚Äòem...‚Äù

Roman studied her with an amused expression. ‚ÄúYou know, this is the most I‚Äôve ever seen you relax around me.‚Äù

Blair lifted a hand lazily. ‚ÄúThass ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre... you‚Äôre normally soooo difficult to deal wit‚Äô‚Äù she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize for that.‚Äù His lips twitched. ‚ÄúI expect the best. That‚Äôs why this company is where it is today.‚Äù

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. ‚ÄúSuppose so...‚Äù Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened, Blair?‚Äù

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. ‚ÄúI was an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Because you trusted the wrong person?‚Äù

Blair let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúDan an‚Äô I grew up together, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th‚Äô city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston‚Äôs, and I was happy ‚Äòbout it. Now I wish he wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

‚ÄúSo, the wedding‚Äôs off?‚Äù Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. ‚ÄúYep. We didn‚Äôt even have a date set.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was holding it up?‚Äù

She blinked at him. Why was he askin‚Äô so many questions? Why was he bein‚Äô so... nice? ‚ÄúMe. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly. ‚ÄúWhy? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?‚Äù

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. ‚ÄúIf what I saw t‚Äôday was anythin‚Äô to go by...‚Äù She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she‚Äôd always known somethin‚Äô was off. There was no passion. No fire. She‚Äôd loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn‚Äôt even sad. Just... angry.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair‚Äôs face scrunched up as she remembered. ‚ÄúSaw him,‚Äù she slurred. ‚ÄúH-havin‚Äô sex with... ugh.‚Äù She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman‚Äôs jaw tensed. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn‚Äôt quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn‚Äôt know why she did it. Maybe ‚Äòcause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.

For a moment, he didn‚Äôt move. But then‚Ä¶ Heat. Raw, consuming heat.

Blair gasped into his mouth, the shock of it searing through her. Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt, desperate to hold on to something solid.

This was different. So different.

Roman pulled back, breathing hard, his gray eyes dark with something unreadable. ‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he murmured, voice rough. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt-‚Äú

She cut him off with another kiss, moving closer, pressing against him.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling.

She needed to forget.

And she wanted‚Ä¶ to feel.

# Chapter Five

Her heart pounded in her chest. Just by his kiss was enough to tell her there had been something wrong with her relationship. Dan had been the problem all along. She didn‚Äôt even love Roman. Found him to be all too arrogant. But what she was feeling from just his kiss was more than she had felt with heavy petting when Dan touched her. Blair pulled back to stare at him.

Her boss raised an eyebrow. His expression... Blair was trying to put a word to it. ‚ÄúBlair, is everything alright?‚Äù His voice was calm, but there was a flicker of something else in his eyes‚Ä¶ something that made her stomach twist. Was it amusement? Hunger? She wasn‚Äôt sure, but she didn‚Äôt care. Not right now. Her mind was whirling with her own emotions. She could feel the heat between her legs and how wet she had become from one kiss.

Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should be ashamed. She had been with Dan and only Dan. Now she was getting all hot and heavy with her boss.

She leaned in closer. She still held his tie, her grip on it tightening. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ need to know,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ if this is normal.‚Äù

His lips quirked into a half-smile, and he tilted his head, studying her with those piercing gray eyes. ‚ÄúNormal for what?‚Äù he asked softly, his tone almost teasing. He reached forward to run his fingers down her face. His eyes followed their movement.

Blair bit her lip, her mind racing. How could she explain this? She couldn‚Äôt just blurt out that she‚Äôd seen her fianc√© fucking someone else‚Ä¶ that she didn‚Äôt even feel jealous about it now or overly heartbroken. She was angry, mad and shocked that she hadn‚Äôt picked up on the affair. No, she couldn‚Äôt say it, but she didn‚Äôt want to come across‚Ä¶. What? Something that wouldn‚Äôt make her sound like a complete flake or shallow. She needed to see if something was wrong with her. She needed to feel wanted.",1,1750671505.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn‚Äôt understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he‚Äôd decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he‚Äôd been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he‚Äôd catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You‚Äôd think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He‚Äôd been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she‚Äôd worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn‚Äôt pay her so well, or if she didn‚Äôt need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn‚Äôt true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston‚Äôs were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fianc√© Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn‚Äôt adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn‚Äôt her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with‚Ä¶ just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father‚Äôs baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn‚Äôt remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

‚ÄúPlease be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,‚Äù she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan‚Äôs bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she‚Äôd have to pass the other doors.

That‚Äôs when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn‚Äôt a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúLaura, you‚Äôre so fucking hot,‚Äù Dan‚Äôs voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair‚Äôs stomach lurched.

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan‚Äôs cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan‚Äôs hands gripped Laura‚Äôs waist and ass, guiding her movements.

‚ÄúErr, yes, fuck me harder,‚Äù Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan‚Äôs grip tightened on Laura‚Äôs ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair‚Äôs fianc√©.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura‚Äôs father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura‚Äôs mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He‚Äôd called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan‚Äôs mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn‚Äôt pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen it. She didn‚Äôt want Dan anymore‚Ä¶ not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

‚ÄúLaura, you are so goddamn tight,‚Äù Dan groaned, arching his back.

‚ÄúIs my pussy better than Blair‚Äôs?‚Äù Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair‚Äôs heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn‚Äôt even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn‚Äôt that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

‚ÄúWhile you two finish up, should I cook dinner?‚Äù

# Chapter Two

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He‚Äôd been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn‚Äôt known of Blair‚Äôs presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

‚ÄúNo thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.‚Äù Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

‚ÄúBlair! What are you doing home today?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn‚Äôt be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.‚Äù

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn‚Äôt felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn‚Äôt needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn‚Äôt use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn‚Äôt joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn‚Äôt like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ‚ÄúBaby..‚Äù

Blair took a step back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch me?‚Äù Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn‚Äôt be?

‚ÄúYou have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.‚Äù Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn‚Äôt sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

‚ÄúDo you know Dan? It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ‚ÄúThis one time was all it took.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.‚Äù Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ‚ÄúPlease, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.‚Äù

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, you dumb bitch.‚Äù Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ‚ÄúShe is lying.‚Äù

Blair shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It only took the one time Dan.‚Äù She nudged him with the baseball bat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.‚Äù Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. ‚ÄúIf you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?‚Äù Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

‚ÄúYou stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn‚Äôt coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan‚Äôs insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ‚ÄúYou set me up, didn‚Äôt you? You knew she was coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn‚Äôt want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn‚Äôt an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn‚Äôt want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin‚Äôs sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThere are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs voice was gentle, like he‚Äôd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn‚Äôt like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just let me talk to you.‚Äù

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúDo I look like a woman who just found out her fianc√© is screwing her cousin?‚Äù

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ‚ÄúYour eyes are a little red, honey, but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

‚ÄúMiss Warner, Can I help you?‚Äù Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn‚Äôt need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ‚ÄúThanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?‚Äù She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Warner.‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs eyes darted to the bat again.

‚ÄúBlair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?‚Äù Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn‚Äôt just been kind. She really didn‚Äôt look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn‚Äôt see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn‚Äôt much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman‚Äôs schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn‚Äôt have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fianc√© shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn‚Äôt recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ‚ÄúHey, Blair. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in today.‚Äù

Blair smiled. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning to be, but I figured I‚Äôd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?‚Äù

Kara shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.‚Äù

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn‚Äôt have to face him just yet.

‚ÄúThanks, Kara.‚Äù

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn‚Äôt hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair‚Äôs aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn‚Äôt been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn‚Äôt when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn‚Äôt big. She hadn‚Äôt wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair‚Äôs ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman‚Äôs office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn‚Äôt much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget intimidating.‚Äù Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ‚ÄúHoly shit, this shit burns.‚Äù Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn‚Äôt help. But it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn‚Äôt call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn‚Äôt been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton‚Äôs baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn‚Äôt big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn‚Äôt even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman‚Äôs desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

‚ÄúRoman please.‚Äù Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman‚Äôs little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúRoman isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Blair put a hand on Roman‚Äôs desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Claire asked.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know?‚Äù Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

‚ÄúYou are his secretary.‚Äù Blair could hear the anger in the other woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not his keeper and I sure as hell don‚Äôt own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.‚Äù Blair was over this conversation.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt answering his mobile hasn‚Äôt for days.‚Äù Claire whined.

Blair‚Äôs lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman‚Äôs move. He didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn‚Äôt help the next words. ‚ÄúWell, one of two things has happened. Either you‚Äôre about to get dumped, or he‚Äôs dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.‚Äù

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, let‚Äôs be honest. He‚Äôs not marriage material. Find someone new.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn‚Äôt an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn‚Äôt something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn‚Äôt know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine. If you want one, go find your own.‚Äù

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

‚ÄúRoman?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he said, his voice unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, slurring slightly, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs... pretty obvious. As you can see, I‚Äôm getting shit-faced.‚Äù She reached for the bottle. ‚ÄúNow give it back so I can finish the job.‚Äù

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù

Blair frowned. ‚ÄúYou know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre going to regret this tomorrow.‚Äù

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,‚Äù Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. ‚ÄúI think I should get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äô want it.‚Äù Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. ‚ÄúI want... a man that ain‚Äôt a cheatin‚Äô rat.‚Äù Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. ‚ÄúDid you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?‚Äù

She‚Äôd met Jessica once. It hadn‚Äôt been a pleasant experience.

Roman‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but his voice softened. ‚ÄúNot all men cheat, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-why‚Äôd she leave you then?‚Äù Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,‚Äù Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. ‚ÄúNot all of them have to do with cheating on the man‚Äôs part.‚Äù

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. ‚ÄúShe cheated on you?‚Äù she whispered, as if it were some great secret. ‚ÄúWas she an idiot?‚Äù

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she‚Äôd ever been interested before. She‚Äôd always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. ‚ÄúI worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.‚Äù

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. ‚ÄúThass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.‚Äù She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. ‚ÄúShould get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‚Äòem...‚Äù

Roman studied her with an amused expression. ‚ÄúYou know, this is the most I‚Äôve ever seen you relax around me.‚Äù

Blair lifted a hand lazily. ‚ÄúThass ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre... you‚Äôre normally soooo difficult to deal wit‚Äô‚Äù she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize for that.‚Äù His lips twitched. ‚ÄúI expect the best. That‚Äôs why this company is where it is today.‚Äù

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. ‚ÄúSuppose so...‚Äù Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened, Blair?‚Äù

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. ‚ÄúI was an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Because you trusted the wrong person?‚Äù

Blair let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúDan an‚Äô I grew up together, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th‚Äô city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston‚Äôs, and I was happy ‚Äòbout it. Now I wish he wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

‚ÄúSo, the wedding‚Äôs off?‚Äù Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. ‚ÄúYep. We didn‚Äôt even have a date set.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was holding it up?‚Äù

She blinked at him. Why was he askin‚Äô so many questions? Why was he bein‚Äô so... nice? ‚ÄúMe. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly. ‚ÄúWhy? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?‚Äù

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. ‚ÄúIf what I saw t‚Äôday was anythin‚Äô to go by...‚Äù She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she‚Äôd always known somethin‚Äô was off. There was no passion. No fire. She‚Äôd loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn‚Äôt even sad. Just... angry.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair‚Äôs face scrunched up as she remembered. ‚ÄúSaw him,‚Äù she slurred. ‚ÄúH-havin‚Äô sex with... ugh.‚Äù She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman‚Äôs jaw tensed. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù",1,1750671320.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lic8t1,https://i.redd.it/uhh1zhcdcn8f1.jpeg,Standard high school ciggie brands and what they said about you.,"The weather in the UK is about as warm as it gets right now so it‚Äôs giving off a bit of a ‚Äúlead into Aussie summer‚Äù vibe. I caught some particular cigarette smoke on the wind in the heat and it took me back a bit.

Cigarettes used to be part of my teenage social hierarchy. I bet they were part of yours if you smoked or had mates who smoked, too.

B&H seemed to cut across most social and ethnic strata but didn‚Äôt have a great foot hold.

No one smoked menthols.

Winfield tended to be a blokey bloke choice or a ladies‚Äô choice equally, across the ‚ÄúAussies‚Äù.

Dunhill Deluxe was favoured by my Greek and Lebanese mates.

Wankers smoked Stuyvesant or higher tier stuff - especially Cartier for the absolute biggest wankers there were.

Marlboro Light for the Asian guys and girls.

As I thought about it, I have to admit a sense of indirect nostalgia for the ciggies and the associated social tolerance of them in restaurants and shopping centres of my youth. 

I have no nostalgia for darts smoked in pubs or bars either at underage events at Metro or ZOS which weee inexplicably ignored by the venues or security, or as a young adult with a fake id or later with a real one in bars with changeable names in St Kilda or Brunswick. It all kind of blends down into amalgamated cigarette smoke, sticky floors, and a hint of spew.

But other times and places - the cigs absolutely give a strong connection to my memories of a different time and place, before things like taxes and root canals loomed large.

The first cigarette I ever smoked to the butt was a B&H Special Filter in a cigar bar with a family friend in his 30s, who was dead not long after. He was a raging opioid addict who thought nothing of giving a very young me the strongest cigarette Benson and Hedges made, and unintentionally walking me through the social ritual of smokes and coffee (like a proper Melbournian wanker) in Bogarts in the Jam Factory. I appreciated the vote of confidence in being treated like an adult in conversation, and the B&H lit with a lacquer and chrome Ronson lighter cemented it to my 13 or so year old brain.

That summer is mostly Super King blue and Bacardi and coke. From there, I changed schools not long after and found myself mixing it up with the smokers. Winnie Blue and Red packed more punch and I drifted in and out of the Blue for a while but Gold was where the right balance was to be had to my 14 to 16 year old lungs. When Winnie light blue came about, I felt it was not more than Marlboro lights without the faux cork filter. 

Winnie Gold smoked on a cold and damp day waiting for a tram. On the stairs at Richmond station on a summer morning.

Bvlgari BLV cologne and Winnie gold smoke is the combined ‚Äútheme scent‚Äù to a summer stay in a private school friend‚Äôs beach house around the Great Ocean Road the following year. 

And that‚Äôs about it - I did smoke a bit longer and there are some fun memories attached to
Marlboro Mediums but that was about the end of my smoking. There are cooler ways to die, after all, and even 20 odd years ago, it wasn‚Äôt a cheap habit.

In the same way that Coca Cola cleverly integrated itself into our memories of holidays, cigarette smoke managed to become part and parcel of the memories and experiences of my youth.

Fuck you tobacco, but also, thank you.

Now, she wanted to take her children too.But today was Rowena's birthday. Estela didn't want to ruin the celebration.She wiped away her tears and stepped into the room with a gift. Rowena, who loved looking pretty, pulled away the moment she reached to touch her head.""And Mommy, you have a cold. Stay away from me-don't mess up my hair. Phoebe did these braids. If they get messed up, she'll be upset.""Estela watched Rowena and her son Josh Leon excitedly talk about making clothes for Phoebe. In the corner, a little doll meant to be ""Mommy"" lay forgotten, tossed aside.Her chest tightened, and a bitter taste spread in her mouth.She had been in a secret marriage with Vance for three years. To everyone else, Phoebe was seen as his rightful wife.But after just a few months apart, even her own children-flesh and blood-now seemed to prefer another woman.Estela lowered her eyes and stood in silence for a long while, only heading upstairs to shower and rest when the housekeeper quietly reminded her.Just then, Vance's secretary arrived. He paused for a moment, surprised to see her.""Ma'am, Mr. Leon won't be coming home tonight. He asked me to pick up the gift he prepared for Ms. Silva,"" the secretary said.""Alright,"" Estela said softly.Once the secretary left, a sharp pain shot through her chest.He remembered to prepare a gift for Phoebe-but not once had he ever given her anything.She dialed a video call.It connected quickly.""What is it?""The screen showed Vance's private lounge.Elegant, luxurious, bathed in dazzling light-every inch oozed the extravagance that Zrefast was known for.He wore a six-figure tailored suit, held a wine glass, and lounged casually on the sofa.There was nothing calculating about him-just cool elegance. His expression was calm, aloof, and untouchable, like frost or snow. He was the kind of man people dreamed of but could never reach.Estela had loved him for six whole years.Her voice softened. ""It's been a while since we saw each other. Tonight, maybe-""""Vance-""Before she could finish, a soft, feminine voice chimed in on his end.It was Phoebe.The call cut off immediately.Just before the screen went black, Vance said simply, ""We'll talk later.""Estela tightened her grip on the phone, staring out at the towering skyline beyond the window.Cars streamed through the streets like rivers of light. The city shimmered-so bright and beautiful it almost didn't seem real.Her husband, Vance, controlled a financial empire and moved markets with ease. But for her-his wife-he had no warmth, no time, no care.Six years, and he'd never changed. Always cold. Always distant.Behind every kind word or gentle look was a wall she could never get past.She'd spent all these years trying to win back his heart.But in that moment, for the very first time-Estela felt something shift. She was tired.Estela didn't call him back. She drifted into a restless, heavy sleep.The next day, Vance finally sent a message: \[Sorry. Happy third anniversary.\]Then another: \[This is to make up for it.\]Not long after, a bank alert came through-an eight-figure deposit.She scrolled past the messages, just as a notification popped up from Phoebe's social media.\[A custom-made diamond ring from Egoset-eight months in the making. A once-in-a-lifetime piece. Thank you, Mr. Leon.\]In the post, Phoebe was all smiles, radiant and charming. A dazzling diamond sparkled on her pale, delicate hand.Dressed in a rose-red gown, she posed beneath a famous tower, the fabric swirling around her like wine. The whole image screamed luxury, decadence-and intention.Estela suddenly remembered the day before she married Vance.It was in the family's quiet, old estate. He'd walked past her along the corridor. His eyes were calm, unreadable-but they had seen straight through her illusions.He said, ""I'll marry you. But that's all.""Back then, she'd thought the line ""I want love, not money"" sounded childish-naive, even.But now, for the first time, she got it.For six years, she'd chased a fantasy-thinking all she wanted was his love.And she'd never had it.She forced down the emotions building inside her and quietly went downstairs.In the garden, she heard Rowena's innocent, sing-song voice, laced with a hint of complaint. ""Why did Mommy come back? Phoebe promised to take us to see the bear ballet today. I wish Mommy just never came back.""Chapter 2""Yeah,"" Josh said softly, eyes downcast. ""Billy said Daddy only married Mommy because he couldn't marry Phoebe. Mommy's pretty, but I still like Phoebe more.""The words hit Estela like ice water down her spine-sharp, sudden, cruel.'He couldn't marry her?' she thought.The shock took a moment to fade, and when it did, her heart felt hollow.She looked at her children.She'd nearly died giving birth to them-both times. Complications, hemorrhaging.They'd been weak, sickly babies, and she'd cared for them around the clock. Barely slept, barely ate. It ruined her health.Then something happened in Zrefast. Vance's father Reggie Leon fell gravely ill.Vance went back to take charge-and brought the kids with him.Since then, she'd been traveling back and forth between two cities. But every time she came back, the children seemed farther and farther away.She didn't even remember how she got back to her room.The kids had private lessons scheduled. The nanny took them out.Even with everything on her plate, Estela messaged Vance again to ask for a meeting.She was his wife. Whether it was about the kids or about Phoebe, she had every right to demand answers.But he brushed her off with a single line. ""I have something important. Let's talk tomorrow night.""There was no way to describe the bitterness welling up inside her.She left the house without thinking and wandered to the place where she and Vance had first met-an old amusement park.It was small, tucked away in a corner of the city.Just as she stepped in and approached the Ferris wheel, she heard a familiar little voice. ""Phoebe, I want to ride the Ferris wheel!""""Okay, I'll go get the tickets.""Estela looked up-and there they were.Not far away, Phoebe and Vance, each holding one of her children's hands. They looked, unmistakably, like a perfect family.Soon, Estela heard her children's voices. ""You're the best. I want to be with you forever.""Phoebe laughed softly, teasing, ""If your mom hears that, she won't be happy.""""I don't like her. Why should I care if she's mad?""The words hit Estela like a blast of arctic wind.She stood frozen, watching in silence as Vance and her children walked hand in hand with Phoebe into the Ferris wheel.The man she had loved for six years. The children she had brought into the world.Without another moment's hesitation, Estela turned and walked away.She'd been holding on for six years-it was time to let go.Back at the old house, she quietly packed up all of her belongings.Then she sent Vance one final message: \[Have the divorce papers ready.\]She left her wedding ring on the nightstand, walked out without a backward glance, and called a cab to the airport.\*\*\*\*\*After leaving the church, Vance returned to the old house with the children.The area outside the church was packed. Just as he was about to check his phone, someone shouted-""Stop! Thief!""A commotion erupted.The bodyguards instinctively moved to shield him, but in the chaos, Phoebe was shoved forward-right into Vance's arms.His phone slipped from his hand, crashed to the ground, and was crushed under the stampede of feet.""Vance, I'm so sorry-your phone."" she said.He frowned briefly, then said calmly, ""It's fine. I'll get another one.""The phone was mostly used to keep in touch with family anyway.Not that anyone in the Leon family texted much. If anyone messaged him at all, it was usually Estela.But her messages had never seemed urgent.\*\*\*\*\*On the way home, the kids were buzzing with excitement.Rowena tugged on his sleeve, eyes sparkling. ""Daddy, is Phoebe really going to stay with us soon? She promised to take me to Candyland!""Even Josh looked hopeful.""Yes,"" Vance nodded.But Josh hesitated, frowning slightly. ""But Daddy. Mommy said we're not very healthy, and the air at Candyland might make us sick. She didn't want us to go. Won't Mommy be upset if she finds out Phoebe's moving in?""Vance responded gently, ""Phoebe is trained in medicine. She once saved Daddy's life. With her here, you'll both be fine. Your mommy won't be staying long anyway. Phoebe's just visiting for a while to help take care of you.""The kids had always been frail. Having Phoebe around might actually do them some good.""Yay!"" They both shouted in delight as they arrived home.But the moment they stepped inside, they found something that made them even happier-Estela had gone back to Trurgh.Vance noticed the wedding ring placed neatly on the nightstand and paused, mildly surprised.Ever since they got married, no matter how badly they fought, Estela had never taken off that ring.Chapter 3Now she had left without a word-and taken the ring off, too.'Is she upset again? Feeling neglected?' he thought.Estela had always been gentle and soft-spoken-like most women from Trurgh, traditional and reserved. No matter how coldly he treated her, she never pushed back.'Well, even the calmest person has a breaking point,' he thought.Still, Vance didn't take it too seriously.He tossed the ring aside without a second thought.""Mrs. Leon won't be coming back for a while. Pack up her things. Clean out the room-Ms. Silva will be moving in soon,"" he ordered.Rowena and Josh's eyes instantly lit up.'Now that Mom is gone, Phoebe can finally move in,' they thought.'And no one would be breathing down our necks anymore-asking the doctors endless questions about our physical activity.''Mom always makes such a big deal out of everything. She insists we meet our monthly exercise quotas and hovers over us every time she comes home.'""It's just a pity,"" Josh muttered gloomily. ""Mom said she'd help us finish building that spaceship. It's super hard.""The puzzle had thousands of tiny pieces. Once completed, it would become an intricate model of a spaceship. Josh had been planning to give it to Phoebe as a birthday gift.But it was exhausting and hard on the eyes-he'd been waiting for Estela to help.Rowena pouted too. ""She was supposed to finish sewing clothes for my doll before she left.""Every time Estela came back, she'd make a whole new wardrobe for the dolls. Phoebe always said how good Estela was at picking fabrics and matching colors.But this time, Estela left so suddenly that the clothes weren't ready.Now Phoebe wouldn't see them, and there'd be no compliments.Estela wasn't as fun or glamorous as Phoebe, but when it came to fiddly little projects like this-she was actually really good.\*\*\*\*\*Meanwhile, in Trurgh-miles away-Estela returned to the home she once shared with Vance.After he moved back to Zrefast with the kids, Estela had stayed behind. Officially, it was for work, but in truth, it was mostly to care for his parents.Reggie had long settled in Zrefast, but the rest of the family had moved to Trurgh over a decade ago.High society in Zrefast had its own rigid rules-everything from dress codes to dinner etiquette was micromanaged.Rosalyn Leon never got along with Reggie and had no interest in returning to that life. She was used to being pampered and calling the shots-and preferred life in Trurgh, where things went her way.The Leon family wasn't fond of women who were too outspoken or ambitious, so for Vance's sake, Estela had kept a low profile and stayed behind as the dutiful daughter-in-law.Her job at Leon Group had always been in name only.But now that she had made up her mind to divorce Vance, none of that mattered anymore.She packed up everything in their marital home and prepared to hand over the keys.Just as she came downstairs, suitcase in hand, the butler happened to see her.""Mrs. Leon, you're back. Rosalyn mentioned she was craving that fish soup you made last time.""But when he saw the luggage, he froze mid-sentence.Estela handed him the house keys.""I won't be living here anymore,"" she said with a faint smile. ""If she wants soup, tell her to hire a chef.""Without waiting for a response, Estela turned and walked out-ignoring the butler's stunned expression.That night, Rosalyn didn't get her fish soup.\*\*\*\*\*Later that evening, Vance video-called Rosalyn. She didn't waste time voicing her discontent.""Honestly, you never should've married a woman from Trurgh. Can't even cook a simple dish of fish soup,"" she said.He looked mildly surprised.Estela had always been respectful and compliant, especially toward elders. Her defiance this time? Unexpected.""It's just a dish,"" he said indifferently. ""If she won't make it, get someone else who will.""Rosalyn looked uncomfortable.Truth be told, she'd already tried hiring several chefs-but none of them could get it quite right. Not like Estela did.Still, she couldn't admit that in front of her son. She muttered a vague reply and left it at that.Off to the side, the butler hesitated, unsure whether to say anything about Estela moving out of the house.""Mr. Leon. Mrs. Leon, she. she's moved out.""He barely got the words out before Vance cut him off, voice cold and flat. ""Forget it. Leave her alone.""Vance ended the call without a second thought.Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office overlooking Zrefast, a faint trace of annoyance flickered across his otherwise impeccable face.He glanced at his newly replaced phone, but in the end, didn't call the contact at the top of his list.Chapter 4Back at the church, both his phone and SIM card had been destroyed.At first, he'd intended to let Estela know-she was still his wife, after all.But lately, it seemed all the special treatment he'd given her over the years had gone to her head.A little lesson wouldn't hurt.Unaware of any of this, Estela slept soundly through the night.The next morning, she returned to the Leon Group and submitted her resignation.It went through without a hitch.When Vance had placed her in the company, it was a low-level, nominal role. No one really knew her true identity.So once she completed her handover, she could leave cleanly.When word got out, a coworker remarked with a knowing smile, ""Must be for your kids, huh? They're what, four? Five? That age clings to their mom like glue. You always had their pictures on your desk-and that necklace with their little faces on it. You've always treated them like treasures.""Estela paused.She had loved Vance-deeply. And naturally, she loved the two children they had together. Even now, separated by cities, she still cared deeply for Rowena and Josh.But.She shook her head, offering a small smile. ""It's not about them.""And that was the truth.The Leon Group was massive and well-connected internationally, but its focus-construction and real estate-was never her passion.Before, as Vance's wife, she hadn't questioned it. The expectations from the Leon family left little room for her own ambitions.But now that she had chosen to leave him, she needed to choose her own future.Her gaze drifted to her phone, where a headline flashed across the screen. \[National Heritage Expo: The Fragrant Arts.\]Perfume blending. Coffee ceremony. Modern reinterpretations of traditional craftsmanship.Something about it caught her eye.Without hesitation, she texted her cousin, Wilford Warren: \[Any chance you can get me a ticket to this event?\]He responded almost instantly. \[Of course. But aren't you always too busy? Between the Leon family and the kids, when do you ever have time for this kind of thing?\]\[I do now.\] Estela replied calmly. \[I'm divorced.\]There was a pause.\[Wait-seriously?\] Wilford's response came with a stunned breath. \[You actually divorced into that Leon family?\]The same Leon family who had built a private rooftop amusement park in the heart of Zrefast-just for their grandchildren. No outsiders allowed.Back when Estela's parents died, the only reason the Leon family even considered the marriage was because her grandfather Keven Warren had once done them a great favor.Otherwise, no way would they have let Vance marry the daughter of a university professor.Even if that professor's father was none other than Keven-the renowned scholar of classical arts.\[If it doesn't feel right, walk away.\] Estela replied lightly, with a smile.Wilford couldn't tell if he admired her courage or pitied her choices. Maybe a bit of both.Wilford: \[But... what about Rowena and Josh? Can you really let them go?\]Estela glanced at her phone.When the kids had moved back to Zrefast, she'd made sure they each had a phone-just in case they missed her and wanted to call.But over the past year, unless she reached out first, neither of them had ever called her.They had everything now: a powerful family name, a life of privilege. and a woman they already saw as their mother.'So why should I keep clinging to a connection that only exists in blood?' she wondered.\*\*\*\*\*Back in Zrefast, inside the Leon family's estate, the nutritionist gently reminded the children, ""Josh, Rowena, did you forget what Ms. Warren said? No being picky with food. Your bodies are still fragile-you need a balanced intake of fat to grow up healthy. And no overdoing it with sweets.""Josh hesitated, looking uncertain.But Rowena waved it off like it was nothing.""Mom already missed her check-in call! She won't know anything. Besides, Phoebe said kids should be happy! And right now, the thing that makes me happiest is eating all these cupcakes!""Just then, a light laugh floated down from upstairs.Phoebe came down, smiling as she walked over and gently tapped Rowena on the forehead. ""You little troublemaker. Alright-whatever Rowena and Josh want, they can have.""""Yay! Phoebe, you're the best! I wish you could stay with us forever!""Their innocent cheers made Phoebe's smile deepen.The nutritionist frowned. She opened her mouth to object, but when her gaze landed on Phoebe, she hesitated-and fell silent.At first, she had assumed Estela was the lady of the house. But now it was clear: Phoebe moved around the Leon family like she belonged. The kids were clearly attached to her.If she upset Phoebe, it might not sit well with Vance.Josh, meanwhile, was conflicted.Chapter 5Last time he ignored Estela's advice, he ended up really sick.Phoebe was sweet, and he did like her-but Estela had warned him that if he kept eating recklessly, he'd get seriously ill again, and Vance would be worried too.He didn't want to cause either of them stress. So as he ate, he held back, choosing more carefully.Rowena, however, wasn't as cautious. She ate too much-mixing cold and hot foods, creamy desserts, and sugary treats. By nightfall, she was doubled over in pain.Curled up on her bed, she trembled from the stomach cramps. Her soft, pale face looked pitiful, flushed and tear-streaked.When Vance heard Rowena wasn't feeling well, he rushed home immediately.Rowena tugged on his sleeve with teary eyes and a trembling voice.""Daddy. did I get sick because I was bad? Did Mommy punish me with a stomachache? She said if I ate too many cupcakes again, a witch would curse me. I didn't mean to. I want Mommy to come back and undo the spell."" she said.More than anything, she missed how Estela would always make her warm soup whenever she was feeling sick.Now, all she could do was cry, a mess of tears and runny nose.Beside them, Phoebe bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Vance, I'm so sorry. I wasn't paying close enough attention. I let Rowena eat too many sweets.""Rowena quickly jumped to her defense, worried her father might be upset with Phoebe. ""Daddy, it's not her fault! It's because Mommy forgot to call me! She doesn't care about me anymore.""Josh blinked in confusion. Thankfully, he'd remembered what Estela said last time he got sick.Even if Estela didn't laugh and play like Phoebe, she always paid close attention when it came to their health.Still, since Phoebe was always so kind, he couldn't help but speak up for her too.""Daddy. Mommy used to remind us a lot. Rowena's still little-she just forgets things sometimes.""""Understood,"" Vance said, his tone a bit firmer now. ""From now on, both of you need to follow the nutritionist's instructions. No more sneaking snacks.""He didn't blame Phoebe for what happened. In fact, he found himself even more frustrated with Estela.'Isn't this exactly what she is supposed to be doing? She used to handle all of Rowena's meals and routines,' he thought.But now that she couldn't even be bothered to check in properly, Rowena had gotten sick. As far as he saw it, this was on her.Estela had no idea Rowena had been sick.That Sunday, she still thought to check in and called the kids over video chat.She was their mother, after all. Even if the emotional bond wasn't what it used to be, she still had a duty to them.When the call came through, Rowena and Josh were busy helping Phoebe try on evening gowns.In just a few days, Reggie would be discharged from the hospital.Normally, that would mean Vance had no reason to stay in Zrefast and would head back to Trurgh to continue expanding the business.But the idea of returning made the twins visibly glum.They weren't ready to see Estela again. And they definitely didn't want to leave Phoebe.Seeing their downcast faces, Phoebe smiled and gently ruffled their hair. ""Hmm. let me guess. Why are my little prince and princess so upset?""She paused dramatically. ""Is it because we're heading back to Trurgh? I thought you'd be excited to see your mom again.""Rowena's eyes welled with tears. She pouted and mumbled, ""What's so great about seeing Mom? We don't want to leave you.""Josh nodded. He did miss Estela a little, but the thought of parting with Phoebe made him hesitate.""Well then,"" Phoebe said with a playful glint in her eye, ""I have some good news.""She let the suspense hang for a second, then smiled.""I've got work to do in Trurgh. I'll be staying there for quite a while-so I'll be coming with you!""""Really?"" Rowena lit up, cheering with joy. If Phoebe was coming to Trurgh too, then everything would be perfect.Right at that moment, Estela's video call came through.The ringtone echoed a few times. Rowena stared at the screen, then deliberately let it ring out before hanging up.Estela called again. And again.Annoyed, Rowena finally blocked the number.Phoebe chuckled and gave her a gentle poke on the forehead but didn't scold her. ""Rowena, why didn't you answer your mom's call?""""She didn't call me the other day on purpose, and I got sick. She's so mean-I don't want to talk to her!"" Rowena pouted.Besides, they'd be going back to Trurgh soon. She'd see Estela then anyway.And if Estela found out Phoebe was moving in, she'd definitely be upset.Chapter 6Rowena didn't want anyone messing with her and Phoebe's time together.Phoebe pinched her cheek with a warm smile. ""As long as our little princess is happy, that's all that matters.""Josh had a fleeting sense that something about all this wasn't quite right. But when he saw the calm expression on Phoebe's face, his doubt faded.Vance always said Phoebe was special-not like other women.And if she didn't think Rowena had done anything wrong, then maybe it really wasn't a big deal.Besides, they'd be seeing Estela again soon anyway.On the other end of the line, Estela stared at the red exclamation mark on her phone screen, stunned.This was a phone she had specially set up just for the twins.No one else used it. No one else had access.She'd known their relationship had grown distant since they'd gone to Zrefast-but she never imagined they would block her.Still worried, she called the housekeeper at the villa, the one in charge of the children's daily care.""Ma'am, the children are doing great,"" the woman said cheerfully. ""Right now they're helping Ms. Silva try on dresses.""The mention of ""Ms. Silva"" hit Estela like a pin to the chest.Those were her children-children she had nearly died bringing into this world.And now, they were looking to another woman for comfort and care.""As long as they're okay,"" she replied quietly.She didn't bring up the fact that her children had blocked her.She knew their personalities-spoiled since birth, prone to sulking. Blocking her was just another form of acting out.If this had happened before, she might have kept calling. Again and again. Refusing to give up.But now. she found she no longer had the energy.As long as they were safe and healthy, that was enough.Whether or not they still saw her as their mother-that was no longer something she could control.Two days later, Reggie was discharged from the hospital.Vance soon made the decision to return to Trurgh and expand the Leon Group's presence there.Before leaving, Rowena and Josh said their goodbyes to classmates at school.The farewell gifts were chosen by Phoebe.But the kids who received them didn't seem all that thrilled.""Barbies and toy cars? These are kinda old now,"" one of their closest friends muttered. ""I liked those teddy bear cakes your mom made way better. Why didn't you bring those?""Rowena pressed her lips together.Those teddy bear cakes were Estela's specialty. They were complicated to make-Estela had burned her hands several times trying to get them just right.But Phoebe didn't know how to make them. 'If only Mom were here.' Rowena thought.Josh looked down too.Ever since Rowena had blocked Estela's number, she hadn't called them once.He hadn't heard her voice in what felt like forever-and honestly, he kind of missed her.Still, he'd be seeing her soon.But if Estela was back, that probably meant less time with Phoebe.Vance had no idea what the kids were thinking.When the housekeeper called to inform him, she said, ""Sir, Mrs. Leon hasn't been back to the villa for over a week. Would you like us to let her know you're returning?""He frowned. His tone cooled immediately. ""No need. If she's not coming back, then clear out the master bedroom. I'll be moving in there with Rowena, Josh, and Phoebe.""In the past, he'd only stayed in the marital home when visiting the children.But since Estela insisted on giving him the cold shoulder, she had no business returning to that house.Meanwhile, back in Trurgh, Estela had moved into her old apartment and started growing flowers on the balcony.She wasn't particularly skilled at gardening, but maybe it was the peace of being on her own-or simply being free from her marriage-that made everything feel lighter.Her neighbor, Cleveland, was quick to scold whenever he saw her plants. ""Girl, if you don't know how to grow flowers, stop drowning them! They're about to keel over!"" he'd grumble, beard twitching with annoyance.After stepping in to rescue the plants himself, another neighbor pulled Estela aside, smiling apologetically.""Don't mind the old man-he's been extra cranky lately. Word is his grandson's refusing to get married, and they had a big falling out. He stormed off and moved in here to cool down.""Estela just smiled.The Leon family had been steeped in strict rules and formality. She'd spent years tiptoeing around, doing everything to please them.Cleveland might be grumpy and old-fashioned, but with his help, gardening suddenly felt more manageable.Over time, the two formed an unexpected friendship, one that felt strangely comforting.That evening, Estela got a message from Delia Allison, her senior from university.Chapter 7When Delia learned Estela would be attending the National Heritage Expo, she immediately suggested they go together.Estela had studied design in college-sharp, creative, and full of fresh ideas. She had once joined Delia's design studio under the pseudonym Smile, contributing to several dazzling, standout projects.But after marrying into the Leon family, she'd quietly stepped away.Delia's studio, meanwhile, had steadily risen to prominence. It was no surprise she'd been invited to such a major industry event.When Estela arrived, Delia was already surrounded by admirers, navigating the room like a star.In recent years, she'd made quite a name for herself, with a strong presence in the design world.People gravitated toward her effortlessly, eager to introduce themselves, eager to be seen.A successful woman always shone brightest-men, in contrast, felt more like props in the background.Estela watched from a distance and lowered her gaze.For years, she had poured her heart into Vance and their children-so much so, she had nearly forgotten who she used to be.'Could I still be that bold, brilliant designer I once was?' she wondered.Just as the thought surfaced, Delia made her way over.""This year's expo is really something. A lot of new talent showing up,"" she said with a knowing smile. ""Watching them today reminded me of you. Back when I tried to keep you at Allison Group-it's a shame how things turned out.""Allison Group had been the name of Delia's college startup-the predecessor to her current firm.Estela gave a small, bittersweet smile. ""Allison Group's doing just fine without me.""In the world of design, fresh talent emerged constantly. No one could stay on top forever.Besides, she hadn't been part of that world for years.""I don't agree,"" Delia said, lighting a cigarette and finally saying what she'd been holding in all these years.Estela looked up when she heard the words, her long lashes fluttering slightly as she gazed at the artwork on display.Delia raised an eyebrow. ""The Rangel Group has been focused on developing a modern aesthetic these past couple of years - from jewelry to fashion. That just happens to be your area of expertise. Estela, I need you.""Estela was no stranger to the Rangel Group.In recent years, it had expanded rapidly, especially in traditional industries.Its head, Wesley Rangel, though young, had already earned a reputation for being ruthless and calculating, with a sharp eye for the future.It didn't surprise Estela that Delia was trying to team up with the Rangel Group to carve out a space in the design market.'But... could I really go back to that world?' she wondered.Just as the thought crossed her mind, a cold, aloof voice called out from nearby. ""Estela? Shouldn't you be taking care of Mom? What are you doing here?""It was Thelma Leon- Vance's younger sister, and a star student at Choross University.Ever since Estela married into the Leon family, Thelma had kept her at arm's length.She had nothing but disdain for women like Estela - women who relied on men, buried themselves in housework, and, in her eyes, had no real worth.Estela hadn't expected to run into her here.She didn't offer much explanation. ""Just came to take a look.""""These pieces have significant artistic value,"" Thelma said coolly. ""Even the simplest design here is probably beyond your understanding. My brother, Josh and Rowena will be back soon. You'd be better off focusing on them.""To her, Estela was nothing special. Sure, she'd heard that Estela had a decent education and some design talent before marrying in, but in the end, she was just another woman who landed on her feet by marrying well. 'What real ability could she possibly have?' she wondered.Estela stood frozen for a moment. 'Vance is coming back?' she thought.Her fingers curled slightly, a trace of bitterness rising in her chest.Even though they were getting divorced, he was returning with the child - and he hadn't even bothered to tell her.In his eyes, the woman who had once been Mrs. Leon really didn't matter at all.Thelma, never one for small talk with Estela, was about to leave when something crossed her mind - the fish soup Rosalyn had been craving.""Oh, right,"" she said offhandedly. ""If you've got time, make some of that fish soup. You're not exactly busy, and your cooking's still passable.""In the past, Estela would've agreed without a second thought.Back then, she'd done everything she could to win the Leon family's approval. No matter how complicated the request, if Rosalyn asked for it, she'd make it happen.But now? She didn't care anymore.""Sorry. I've got my own things to take care of. Let the chef handle it.""

I can drink 2 full cans of monster in the span of an hour, without any kind of effect (except that I'm not thirsty anymore). I could go sleep right after without a problem. 

I had periods where I bought lots of energy drinks, and drank between half a liter and a liter every day for a month or 2, and nothing happened whatsoever, it could have been water.   
And quite often I stopped for a few months, same thing, nothing happened, no headache, or even tiny withdrawal frustration. 

I don't have ADHD either. 

I also HATE bitter taste, and alcohol is awful for me (just the taste). But I doubt that's correlated. Thus I don't drink coffee, and can't compare what would happen with it.

My mother and sister both love coffee, but same thing than me, no energizing effect at all. So I guess there is a genetic trait.

We are having a destination wedding a 9 hr flight from home. We have connections to the country we picked but I also liked the idea of being far away from home and my narc mum not having the ability to interfere and spoil what should be the best day of my life. 
As an example, I threw her a surprise party for my graduation to try and stop her from sabotaging it, but she still showed up to my friends salon and started trauma dumping a load of weird information about herself on to everyone there, and then verbally abused me in the street after the ceremony.

Throughout my childhood she was a nasty abusive alcoholic. I moved out of her house in my early teens and lived with my dad, then moved to a different city at 18. I have done so much work on myself, attended counselling and have spent thousands of hours and ¬£ on trying to ensure I break the cycle. Since I left, she also developed a prescription medication addiction. She is absolutely horrible, I could go on and on about the past but the current situation is..

We are extremely low contact, and usually go months at a time without any form of communication, she usually only reaches out when its almost mothers day, her birthday etc because she wants us to make a huge deal of these events. But once I got engaged, she started reaching out more regularly asking me about when WE can start planning the wedding. I've been able to brush her off quite well because there's nothing she can do to help us with a wedding on the other side of the world. She was very keen to come to a bridal shop with me though. 

I knew she would do something weird at my dress fitting, so I went with my lovely MiL and one of my bridesmaids, then booked to go with my NM, Auntie and other bridesmaid the week after, so I was able to have the 'normal' experience first. My NM showed up to the dress fitting with her nails done with French tips with glitter accents on the ring fingers, and was showing everyone her 'wedding nails', weird. She then started showing the staff photos of my grandparents on their deathbeds and made the experience about her and her grief. My auntie told her to stop it but she just carried on, then started telling them all her health issues. 
I didn't tell my NM I'd been to a shop the week before but she found out at the end of the fitting, and proceeded to storm off down the street away from us all, told me I looked shit in the dress in the other shop I went to which I preferred and tried to blackmail me in to picking the one I tried on with her, saying she is buying the dress for me and that's the only one she can afford. 
Following this, I kept my distance and ordered the dress I liked best. 
We sent the invites out not long after this. We were visiting my hometown so to cut postage costs we drove to the guests houses and hand posted the invites. We were visiting my Fianc√©s hometown a couple of days later so planned to do his side then, and then sent the invites to everyone else in the post. Before we even had chance to do this, my NM posted a photo of the wedding invitation on Facebook Emoji. My fianc√© saw it before me and immediately messaged her asking to take it down. She completely blanked him for 2 days, meaning his mum first saw the invite on her Facebook page, and everyone she has as a friend now knows my business. If I wanted the invitation on Facebook I'd have done that myself. When she finally took it down, she messaged me and said it is my fault for not telling her I didn't want her to put it on Facebook. She didn't once apologise she just deflected and said it was all me. I ignored her calls and messages for a while after this because there is no benefit in arguing with someone so delusional. When she didn't get a response she sent my Fianc√© a message saying she wont contact us again but she loves us both very much (spoiler: she did because it was almost mothers day and she wanted a gift). 

She messaged the other day asking about going mother of the bride dress shopping, which will be challenging because drunk or not she is always especially horrible to me when we are alone. I suggested a date and then she just randomly told me she's been checked in to rehab for a few weeks. I found this really surprising as she's always very obviously been an alcoholic, but has never acknowledged it, she still didn't in the message she said she 'sometimes drinks too much' lol. I think its a good step for her but I don't think it means I should be forced to have a normal relationship with her immediately, or ever just because of that. She fucked up my entire childhood.

She had previously mentioned staying with me in my hotel the night before the wedding, which I immediately shut down and said I want to spend the night alone. She didn't push too much. She has messaged me again asking me to book her in with the hairdresser on the morning of my wedding, saying she only wants a braid so it won't take long. But in my mind she was never spending the morning with me, I just want her to attend as a normal guest so I can enjoy the morning waking up alone, then getting ready with my two friends. 

Has anyone ever had this kind of situation before, and what did you do to make things work best for you? Is it unheard of to not have her with me in the morning of my wedding? 

We're getting married by the sea I just want to wake up and sit on the balcony with a coffee and listen to the waves by myself for a bit until friends/vendors arrive. ",1,1750670467.0,narcissisticparents,2,1.0,False

I rarely use Reddit, but when I do it's exclusively in r/Wetshaving, that's a hobby that I've gone from start to finish, and after trying everything(almost) I dialed everything back down to the basics. I am saying all this so to inform you that I do not and will not go down the rabbit hole of the coffee hobby, it's not financially practical or practically practical. IF(and that's a big if) there is an overlap between the two hobbies, i have learned that technique is everything and fancy gadgets will not solve a problem. 

Ok so here are the 5 machines I am looking at the moment, budget is between 90-120$. Below I will share links of the products, please be informed that these links lead to AliExpress.

P.S.- I had forgotten that reddit does not allow AliExpress direct links, so I changed the links to the products to pictures of the products in imgur. Hopefully that'll be enough.

So, I know that a grinder is very important, I have one, a Timemore C3ESP pro, it's good enough. I will also get a bottomless portafilter, and a puck screen, tamper etc. etc. And freshly roasted beans ofc.

Small sidenote rant: I cannot find an espresso machine without that damn steamer.... I want to make coffee, I couldn't care less about milk steaming/frothing.

My questions are as follows(if I remember any more I will ad them as a comment to this post):
- Other that difference in water capacity and wattage, is there any difference(functional) between these machines? 
- Will any generic botomless 51 mm portafilter fit any of these machines?
- I know it says 20 bars on these machines, but they probably aren't 20 bars. I also know that 9 bars is all that is needed for an espresso shot, but if I set my grinder to very fine settings(like 0.üòé and tamper the puck, will any of these machines still be able to pull a normal shot?

If I have missed some important details, if so, pllease excuse me. I appreciate the help in advance!",1,1750670230.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My country's winter isn't like that of the mountainous/highland regions around the world. We don't get snow or below freezing temperatures. On the contrary, our temperatures fluctuate. Sometimes we even get boiling hot days during winter. I have kombucha, coffee kombucha and a ginger bug currently fermenting and because of these fluctuating, but generally cold temperatures, the results have been inconsistent. My idea is to (1) raise the temperature inside my fermentation cupboard (that also serves as my workstation, on top) to ideal fermentation temperatures and (2) to keep it constant throughout the fermentation process. I would just like to ask for some advice from fellow brewers with more experience. How do you brew efficiently during the winter?",2,1750670170.0,Kombucha,0,1.0,False

Last week we was not together and I called him on the way to work just to say have a good day and he was so rude putting the phone down on me for no because I missed his call back etc and just being generally rude. When he stays at mine I tend to get up and make him a cup of coffee and then he does it for me when I stay at his. This morning, I woke up at 5:15 and got us a coffee and I left it on the side and gently nudged him a few times to try to wake him up. He just kind of moved around and went back to sleep, I then said to him ‚Äòyou really need to wake up now‚Äô and he asked for the time and I said it was quarter to 6 and he shot up and proceeded to get angry at me and say why didn‚Äôt I wake him up, he started sulking and throwing his dressing gown around in a strop etc. I told him I tried a few times but he didn‚Äôt wake up and he said I should have tried harder??? I proceeded to tell him that I am not his mum and he is an adult who should be able to get up on his own. He stormed out the house and of course I ended up apologising and crying. But now I‚Äôm just sat here thinking why did I apologise? I think sometimes I go above and beyond to try to please people and put others first and I just end up feeling like a door mat. On top of this I have a lot going on at the moment, my nan is going into a care home this week as she is unwell, and It was Father‚Äôs Day and my parents wedding anniversary close together the past few weeks and I lost my dad a couple of years ago, and on top of this my brother is currently battling drug addiction. I want to become more assertive because I don‚Äôt want this to be my future, but I end up just crying or sounding whiney.

Are you a woman who‚Äôs been craving something a little more intentional? A little more exciting?  
Maybe you‚Äôve had a long week. Maybe you just want to feel wanted. Held. Desired. Maybe‚Ä¶ you just want a good date.

It‚Äôs a special feeling‚Ä¶ waking up and knowing you want to share tomorrow with someone new.  
Not just for the thrill, not just the touch but for the connection, the laughter between sips of filter coffee, the way eyes meet when the world forgets to interrupt.

We can keep it simple or sweetly memorable:

1. A bike ride down the ECR, to DakshinaChitra, explore, laugh, maybe share a few stories from childhood‚Ä¶ followed by lunch at Mahabs. OR
2. A slow day together at Phoenix Mall in Velachery, coffee, people-watching, teasing banter, maybe a cheeky movie if we‚Äôre vibing.

You choose. I‚Äôm all in.

Let‚Äôs make it simple:  
üí¨ We vibe tonight.  
üõµ I pick you up tomorrow (or meet somewhere that feels safe + easy for you).  
ü•ò We eat, we talk, we see where the chemistry leads.

What a whirlwind 24 hours for the National Basketball Association! As the confetti settled on a historic NBA Finals Game 7, the league landscape was already being reshaped by a blockbuster trade and a heartbreaking injury. Grab your coffee, because there's a lot to unpack from a weekend that delivered on all fronts: championship glory, seismic roster shifts, and a sobering reminder of the game's brutal physical toll.

## Finals Frenzy: Thunder Strike Gold!

The Oklahoma City Thunder are your 2025 NBA Champions! In a dramatic Game 7 on Sunday, the youthful Thunder defeated the resilient Indiana Pacers 103-91, capping a truly historic season. This marks the franchise's first title since relocating to Oklahoma City in 2008, fulfilling a long-awaited dream for ""Loud City.""

**Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: A Season for the Ages.** Reigning MVP [Shai Gilgeous-Alexander delivered a Finals MVP-winning performance](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thunder-win-nba-finals-in-game-7-shai-gilgeous-alexander-leads-okc-to-first-title-pacers-falter-without-star/) with 29 points and 12 assists in the decisive game. SGA now joins an elite club, becoming only the fourth player in NBA history to win the scoring title, regular season MVP, and an NBA championship in the same season, a feat previously achieved by legends like Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal. His incredible individual success alongside team triumph solidifies his place among the league's brightest stars. Read more about [SGA's historic achievement on ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_id/45539190/nba-finals-2025-thunder-sga-legacy-historic-title-run).

The Thunder's victory also cemented their place in history as one of the most dominant teams, accumulating 84 total wins between the regular season (a franchise-record 68 victories) and the playoffs. This total ties the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for third-most wins in any championship season. The core of Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams (20 points in Game 7), and Chet Holmgren (18 points, 5 blocks ‚Äî a Game 7 record) showcased remarkable synergy, leading many to believe [this young Thunder squad is perfectly positioned to be the NBA's next dynasty](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-thunder-are-perfectly-set-up-to-be-next-nba-dynasty-after-winning-first-championship-in-okc/).

While the game itself was a hard-fought battle, the pre-game atmosphere had its own moments. Oklahoma native and Tony Award-winning actress [Kristin Chenoweth's rendition of the national anthem drew mixed reactions](https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/sports/tony-award-winning-actress-kristin-chenoweth-slammed-by-nba-fans-for-game-7-national-anthem/) from fans. And if you tuned in early, you might have caught some viewers blasting the [""unwatchable"" ESPN pregame show](https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/viewers-blast-unwatchable-nba-finals-game-7-pregame-show.html). But by tip-off, all eyes were on the court for the league's first Game 7 since 2016, and the seventh different champion in as many years.

## Trade Winds Blowing: Durant Rocks Houston

Just hours before Game 7 tipped off, the NBA world was stunned by a blockbuster trade: [Kevin Durant is heading to the Houston Rockets](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_id/45561747/sources-suns-trading-kevin-durant-rockets-blockbuster-deal)! The Phoenix Suns agreed to send the 15-time All-Star to Houston in exchange for Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 pick in this week's draft, and five second-round selections.

**Houston's Bold Move:** This trade marks a massive win for the Rockets, who instantly vault into legitimate championship contention. As ESPN's Kevin Pelton noted in his [trade grades](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_id/45562152/kevin-durant-trade-grades-winners-losers-reaction-suns-rockets-blockbuster), Houston received an A+ for acquiring an elite scorer without giving up its most prized young assets like Amen Thompson or Jabari Smith Jr. Durant's fit with a strong defensive team that struggled with half-court offense last season appears seamless, especially reuniting him with coach Ime Udoka.

**Suns' Reckoning:** For Phoenix, the deal received a D grade, largely seen as a ""rushed deal"" by an inexperienced front office. While they recoup their own No. 10 pick and some future draft currency, the Suns now face a roster imbalance with a surplus of shooting guards (Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks). This move signals a pivot for the Suns, who aim to retool around Booker but might struggle with overlapping skill sets and significant salary commitments.

The league has already adjusted. The Rockets' odds to win the 2026 NBA title have [leapt to +850](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2026-nba-championship-odds-thunder-open-as-heavy-favorites-to-repeat-ahead-of-knicks-cavaliers-rockets/), positioning them as a top contender in the West, potentially setting up a fierce rivalry with the newly crowned Thunder.

## Injury Report: Haliburton's Heartbreaking Exit

In a devastating turn of events during Game 7, Indiana Pacers star [Tyrese Haliburton suffered a non-contact right lower leg injury](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_id/45564723/pacers-tyrese-haliburton-helped-lower-right-leg-injury-game-7-nba-finals-vs-thunder) that his father confirmed was an Achilles injury. Haliburton, who had been battling a calf strain, collapsed to the court in the first quarter and was ruled out for the remainder of the game. His emotional reaction and visible pain immediately signaled the severity of the injury, prompting an outpouring of support from across the league.

This incident has ignited a broader discussion about the rising number of Achilles tears in the NBA this season. Haliburton's injury marks the third prominent Achilles tear in these playoffs alone, following those of Celtics star Jayson Tatum and Bucks star Damian Lillard. Dr. Jesse Morse, a regenerative medicine doctor, issued a ""strong warning"" to the NBA, highlighting [three superstar Achilles tears in just two months](https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nba/nba-receives-strong-warning-following-tyrese-haliburtons-achilles-injury-2089153), raising concerns about the league's demanding physical toll and current injury management protocols.

For the Pacers, Haliburton's injury casts a long shadow over their future. He will likely miss all or most of the 2025-26 season, dramatically altering their championship aspirations. Decisions loom regarding Myles Turner's impending free agency and how to maintain competitiveness in the Eastern Conference without their franchise cornerstone.

## Draft Buzz: Phoenix's Pivotal Pick & Roster Rejigging

With the NBA Finals now concluded, all eyes turn to the 2025 NBA Draft, just days away on June 25-26. The Kevin Durant trade has significantly reshaped draft conversations, particularly for the Phoenix Suns, who now hold the No. 10 overall pick.

**Phoenix's Complicated Choice:** As outlined in [CBS Sports' latest mock draft](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-mock-draft-kevin-durant-trade-shakes-up-first-round-leaves-suns-with-complicated-decision-at-no-10/), the Suns face a complex decision at No. 10. Do they gamble on a young prospect with high upside for the future, or opt for a more seasoned player who can contribute immediately alongside Devin Booker and Bradley Beal? Prospects like center Khaman Maluach or forward Carter Bryant are among the intriguing options, with Phoenix likely targeting a big man or a disruptive point-of-attack defender.

Beyond Phoenix, other teams are strategizing their draft approach:

*   The [Los Angeles Lakers](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6430255/2025/06/22/nba-draft-2025-needs-lakers-knicks-warriors/) are still seeking a true center and hold the No. 55 pick.
*   The [Boston Celtics](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2025/06/22/celtics-2025-nba-mock-draft-picks/), facing an ""impending financial crunch"" after Jayson Tatum's Achilles injury, hold picks No. 28 and No. 32. They may prioritize cost-controlled depth and players like Drake Powell or Ryan Kalkbrenner.
*   The [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_id/45515479/2025-nba-mock-draft-59-picks-trade-talks-heat-30-teams) appear set to select Cooper Flagg with the No. 1 pick, while the [San Antonio Spurs](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_id/45515479/2025-nba-mock-draft-59-picks-trade-talks-heat-30-teams) are projected to take Dylan Harper at No. 2 to complement Victor Wembanyama.
*   For those with a keen eye on potential pitfalls, a recent [Sporting News analysis highlighted ""bust candidates""](https://www.sportingnews.com/in/nba/news/nba-draft-2025-bust-candidates-riskiest-picks-ace-bailey/076f02359be20b78521ee89d) such as Ace Bailey, Danny Wolf, and Egor Demin, citing concerns around polish, fit, and efficiency.

But what if we told you there‚Äôs one that looks like it came out of a premium gadget store, serves *hot* water on demand, and still gives you RO-pure mineral-rich water without being high maintenance?

That‚Äôs exactly what the **AO Smith Z8** does and we‚Äôre kinda obsessed.

We broke it down feature by feature so you can see if this tech-loaded beast is the right fit for your kitchen (and your back pain if you keep boiling water every time someone wants tea).

*Curious if the AO Smith Z8 is the one your kitchen‚Äôs been missing?* [Take a closer look here](https://www.amazon.in/AO-Smith-Z8-10-Litre-Purifier/dp/B0755D9T1M?tag=rahulbhatia-21) ‚Äî we found all the juicy details so you don‚Äôt have to.

Now, let‚Äôs get into why this one‚Äôs *actually* worth your attention‚Ä¶

# First Impressions ‚Äî Built Like a Modern Gadget

Let‚Äôs start with what you *can‚Äôt* ignore: **it looks stunning**. The AO Smith Z8 doesn‚Äôt look like a water purifier ‚Äî it looks like it belongs in a sleek caf√© or a futuristic coworking space. The black gloss finish and smart LED display scream premium.

But it‚Äôs not just about looks.

# 8-Stage RO Purification ‚Äî With a Twist

AO Smith packs in their **8-stage purification system**, which includes:

* **RO + SCMT (Silver Charged Membrane Tech)** for extra protection post-RO
* **Pre-filter, sediment, carbon**, and **MIN-TECH** that adds essential minerals back into the water
* **UV lamp** to kill microbes in the storage tank

But here‚Äôs where it really stands out‚Ä¶

# Hot Water Function (Yes, Really)

This is a rare feature ‚Äî **you can dispense hot water at 45¬∞C or 80¬∞C** for making tea, coffee, or even a quick cup of Maggi. Sounds fancy, but we actually *used* this more than we expected.

No boiling water on the gas. No waiting. Just tap and go.

(Parents with toddlers or elders in the house ‚Äî this is a game changer.)

# Taste & Water Quality

The water feels smooth, light, and crisp. There‚Äôs no weird chemical aftertaste or overly flat flavor you sometimes get with ROs.

And yes, the **MIN-TECH** mineral addition is noticeable. It‚Äôs not just marketing fluff.

# ‚ö° Convenience & Smart Features

* **Smart digital display** shows tank levels, filter alerts, and hot water modes
* **Night assist glow** ‚Äî yes, it has a glow mode to help you find water in the dark üëÄ
* **Dual water dispensing**: You can choose hot or room temp water

Plus, the **10L storage tank** is one of the largest in its class. Great for bigger families.

# Installation & Maintenance

AO Smith offers **free installation**, and the support is solid in most Indian cities. Filters are slightly premium-priced but justified considering the tech inside.

There‚Äôs also **zero water wastage**, thanks to the Advance Recovery Technology (ART), which saves more water than standard RO systems.

# Should You Buy It?

If you‚Äôre okay spending above ‚Çπ20,000 and want:

* Stylish design + hot water on tap
* Excellent purification and taste
* A large tank and a brand that backs its warranty

...then the **AO Smith Z8** is a solid, premium investment for long-term use.

There's this very sweet, shy, hardworking and intelligent 19YO girl that he constantly talks to. Her light is so bright and she is so sweet and genuinely kind. Not the fake people-pleasing type of kind.

It absolutely breaks my heart seeing her slowly get hooked. They were talking next to me and this guy was talking about his favourite cocktail being a blowjob, (some mix of irish cream and coffee liquer), and other innuendos of that nature. I've already heard him ask things like: ""What kind of celebrity would you think that you could be with or that you would want to date?"" to everyone including her. Questions to suss out what kind of person she would be into, only to start masking those traits to her.

The  priest made several comments about her weight. On one occasion, he remarked that she must be eating well because she had gained weight. My sister clarified that she responded by explaining that some people would find such comments offensive and the priest should mind the differences in culture. On another occasion, when my sister declined coffee and chose juice instead, the priest warned her that she would gain weight and advised her to exercise. My sister replied that she felt comfortable in her body and was happy with how she looked.

Feeling uncomfortable, she reported the matter to the wardens, who instructed the priest to apologize. Instead of sincerely apologizing, the priest confronted my sister, saying he was shocked she had reported him because he thought he was just joking and that he was surprised she was hurt. He then added that he would no longer joke or speak with her but only limit it. 

My sister clarified that her concern was not about the conversation itself, but about the content of what was said, which she found inappropriate. She felt belittled and singled out by the priest's reaction. To make matters worse, the priest brought his wife to confront her as well, further escalating the situation. He said to his wife he only spoke about exercising. On both occasions my sister told several people including me about these comments. 

My sister feels devastated and feels targeted and uncomfortable within the community.. I'm encouraging her to report this but now she's scared that she making things worse. There is already tension between wardens and priest and she fears taking further action will alienate her. She also doesn't want the priest to be fired or something. I guess she's just afraid. 

My sister has always struggled with her weight and faced alot of bullying while in High School because she was underweight throughout her life. As a baby she was also malnourished because of being a fussy eater.

1libo7u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1libo7u,"My 3-night stay on the serene and majestic Bantayan Island, Cebu","We spent our last weekend on Bantayan Island and we truly miss it already. The place is the epitome of tranquility and beauty (and delicious food, especially seafood üòã). This was my second visit to this beautiful island (first one was in 2017) and I've seen so many improvements and developments here especially roads around the island, I can't believe how easy it is to drive around it now.

We got there by driving ourselves using our car, but if you prefer to commute, buses from the Cebu North Bus Terminal go directly to the island,  your bus will board a ferry either from Medellin Port or Hagnaya Port.

Here's how our travel went:

ITINERARY 

***Day 1 (Thursday)***

- Left our house at 6am, stopped over at Danao City McDonald's for breakfast, arrived at Medellin port at 9 am. Getting a ferry ticket was relatively easy but their terminal is still under construction so a bit of patience is a must. 

- The ferry left around 11 am and docked at Bantayan Island port at 12nn, our accomodation (Jelly's Haven) was only 10 mins drive from the port

- Since our hotel is located on the other end of Santa Fe Beach, we spent our afternoon traversing that very long white sand shoreline , almost comparable to Boracay's but not as fine as the one in Bora.

- We had our dinner at the restaurant in our hotel

***Day 2 (Friday)***

- We had our breakfast at our hotel resto then left for Baigad Lagoon at 9 am which was a 20 min drive from our accommodations, and we had a relaxing swim at their beach. There are cottages, hammocks and sunbeds around the area for the convenience and unwinding of their visitors. They also have a bar that serves food, liquor, and shake. Some visitors also brought their own food (no corkage fee). You can stay there the whole day until their closing time, but we only stayed until 1pm since we wanted to visit other spots. 

- We tried to visit Lalio's cave which was only 10 mins drive from Baigad but they already shut the site down and is currently for sale so we were disappointed since it's the best cave on the island as per reviews online. So, we just drove to our next destination which was Kota Park (located at the north part of the island) which was a 20-30 mins drive from Baigad. They have a small fort ruins there and at the beach side there's what they call Bantay/Bontay Baywalk. They have a long bridge/aisle  that ends at a small tower where you can dive. Great place for taking instagrammable photos but that's it. Locals, especially kids, go there to play. I didn't feel comfortable staying there due to some kids begging for coins (sorry I don't support money begging especially if you're a kid). However, it's still worth to visit this place. We only spent 30 mins there. 

- We drove down through the western road of the island and reach Terisito's Dragon Fruit Farm, located at the southwest part of the  island. The farm isn't really that big but still a great place to visit. They also have a resto but we only ordered some snacks since we were not hungry yet. We tried their dragon fruit ice cream sandwich and churros with dragon fruit syrup. I'm telling the churros is one of the best ones I've ever had! Their homemade dragon fruit ice cream was really good, too! Before we leave, we bought a jar of dragon fruit jam from  as a souvenir. 

- Around 4pm, we drove back to our hotel to rest, then we went to MJ Square, a popular spot in Sta. Fe where you can dine, drink and buy souvenirs. We ate at Larry's Sarapoi, their seafood was really tasty and fresh. Their scallops were my favorite.

***Day 3 (Saturday)***

- We drove to The Coco Cafe for breakfast. It's a bit cheaper compared to the other breakfast places in Sta Fe. Food tasted really good but unfortunately there were so many customers when we arrived. Took them 1 hour to serve all our food. 

- Around 10 am we started our journey by visiting The Ruins (10 mins away). It's a really popular cliff jumping spot in Bantayan but unfortunately it was low tide when we arrived, and I forgot to mention it is the jelly fish season right now in Bantayan (June-July). I really wanted to do cliff jumping there but I guess there's always a next time.  

- Next spot was Omagieca Ob-ob Mangrove Garden. If you're a nature lover, I'd say you're really adore this one. I didn't expect to have a very lengthy walk around the mangrove area through bamboo bridges. Their 75 pesos entrance fee was totally worth it!  There are also so many souvenir shops and snack stores across.

- At around 12nn we went to Sta Fe. Beach Club Resort. Inside the resort you can find a cave where you can have a nice cold swim inside it. There's also a nice pool near the beach. Day-use is allowed here and you will be given a wrist band that you have to wear so you can go in and out the resort until the closing time for day-use guests which is at 6pm. They also serve yummy meals and some cool refreshments like their delicious ube halo-halo. We stayed here until 3pm. 

- We went to MJ Square again to buy some souvenirs. We spent an hour there. I still wanted to do more activities but unfortunately we were kind of exhausted especially from the heat so we decided to go back to our hotel to take a shower and have some nap. 

- For our supper, we went to Thai-Poon, and I must say it's one of the best Thai restos I've ever tried here in Cebu. Many claim that they serve authentic Thai food. I'm not sure if it's true, but all I know is I really enjoyed their food, like a lot! 

****Day 4 (Sunday)***

-This was unfortunately our day of departure going back the city. The last ferry trip is at 12:30 pm so we decided to spend the remaining time to walk along Sta Fe Beach. We arrived at The Hungry Beach Co where you can find a few cafes and bars. A really nice guy approached us and offered to eat at their cafe. He showed us their menu and it was quite cheap so we decided to eat there, their cafe is called AbtananSaIsla. Their silog was really good and their serving was bigger compared to The Coco Cafe, and again they're cheaper! Their brewed coffee was perfect, and  their waffles was such a great treat to have at the end our journey. 

- We drove back to Sta Fe port to get our ferry ticket. I was confused at first bc there were so many men approaching you offering tickets. It was kind of chaotic as they compete with each other to get a customer. Anyway, I decided to choose one guy and he successfully bought me a ticket even though I was worried at first. He showed me the price of the tickets and he didn't ask for anything, so I just gave him a 100 peso tip. 

- The ferry was supposed to leave at 12:30 but due to some delays it left around 1pm, then we arrived at Medellin port at around 2pm. I drove back to Cebu City and arrived here around 5pm.

But at the end it was a sigh of relief after finding out that I passed the exam.

I started preparing on 15th May, 2025 so I took around 40 days to prepare with studying/solving for 10+ hours daily while in a current job as senior staff at Plao Alto Networks.

Here are details which may help someone seeking to pass in future -

1. Followed Dions Training (Brendon Spencer)on Udemy(8/10) as base study guide. I didn't follow any books like OSG because I have a habit of fast learning using videos at 2x which makes books boring to me personally.
2. Watched few YouTube videos like Prabh Nairs coffee shots, Peters 2024  
Addendum, few questions solving videos.
3. Dions Udemy course had around 800q. (8/10)
4. Solved around 2250q from learnzapp with 81% readiness score. (7/10)
5. Boson 700q (8/10)
6. I downloaded some pdf from internet with 1350q with most of them from Shon Harris. (8.5/10) they were good and challenging.
In total solved around 5500q.

We apparently are on ‚Äògood terms‚Äô and he said he still wanted to contact me if he ever saw me but I don‚Äôt know if he actually meant that. I really highly doubt that he even thinks of me as a positive relationship experience as he claims. From my interpretation of what happened, there are no negative feelings from his side. At least I believe he doesn't actually care that much and has moved on. For me however, I'm really struggling to move on. There are days where I feel so empty I can't get out of bed. I have not even explained to my friends what happened because I felt it was too embarrassing. I basically showed love to someone who expressed interest in me for 6 whole months but to him he disregarded the relationship like it meant nothing. My friends have said they have seen him just casually going about his activities with his friends like nothing happened. It just really sucks because I feel like I have lost my entire spark. I feel like I‚Äôve been drained emotionally. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable to even open to anyone anymore. Yet for him, it didn't even bother him one slightest bit.

I have conflicting feelings, I feel sad about the breakup and I miss the times we had but I don‚Äôt generally miss him. I don‚Äôt miss the nasty things he said to me that made me doubt myself. I do however miss the times where he would take my places and he would buy me gifts for valentines, birthdays, Christmas, ect. I miss the dinners I had with his family, I really miss talking to his mum and his sister. I miss his dog and the coffee dates we used to have while walking his dog. I used to miss when he used to send me care packages whenever I was sick. I miss all the things in a relationship but I don‚Äôt really miss him though. He really did try to put in effort but he always would say things that played off as ‚Äòjokes‚Äô that actually seemed really nasty. It was always nitpicking my habits I had and he used to get frustrated by them. All these comments made me think less of myself. At that point, I decided I had enough. I told him over the phone that I was unhappy. He said however that he felt like I was misinterpreting his ‚Äòlight-hearted jokes‚Äô as he does it with all his friends and family. While this is true, I didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with someone who was constantly judgemental of others.

¬†

I blocked and removed him  
off of everything. I haven't contacted him since his birthday. I don't really  
understand why I sent him a birthday message.  He  
repsonded but attempted to make conversation, he sent me a picture of the cake his sister made him and it was a cake of his dog. After I didn't respond to the message he sent me about his cake, he blocked me on iMessage.

I had the impulse to contact him and regretted it afterwards.   
 



I keep thinking about how he is probably talking badly behind my back to his friend group and his friend group are using me as a laughing stock. I haven‚Äôt even said a word to my friends about him or how I felt, so it feels like I‚Äôm just painted as the villain to his friends no matter what I do.

¬†

It‚Äôs made me feel like I‚Äôm incapable of loving someone. I felt like I had really tried to put in effort and the whole situation felt like a waste. I really tried to not overthink or prepare for the worst, I really did. Every time I felt like something was off about his presence or our relationship that my head started to spiral. I don‚Äôt know how I am going to improve with my outlook with other relationships after this one. I don‚Äôt know why he even wanted to stay with me for 6 months if I made him that angry.",1,1750668550.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

Progress is being made on all kinds of things‚Ä¶. chronic pain, TMJ, sleep apnea, postural issues, neurological diseases, ADHD, and on and on.

It‚Äôs like seeing your vision come together.

Over ten years of:

* suffering and going in circles and feeling like I wasn‚Äôt in control of my life.
* getting the runaround from lots of various dentists.
* getting told I was crazy or full of shit.

And now it‚Äôs like all of that is starting to feel like it was worth it. Like it‚Äôs going to contribute to some very positive change in the world.

Additionally it is giving me some extremely valuable data on how others experience the whole thing. Because I had only a handful of longer-term data points all these years (me, my son and my wife).

And now i‚Äôm starting to have a LOT more. And i‚Äôm learning from it.

Today i want to talk about the fact that this process can tire you out.

# What do I mean by it can ‚Äòtire you out‚Äô?

Some of you might be thinking ‚ÄúBut wait a minute Ken‚Ä¶ I thought you said this process gives us amazing amounts of energy and productivity?‚Äù

And you would be right, but there is another side to the story.

>

If I do my jaw-body stretch cycle for long enough (usually 20‚Äì30 minutes) I can often make myself tired enough that I want to take a power nap.

But then after shutting my eyes for 10‚Äì20 minutes I feel very well rested as if it‚Äôs a new day. Plus when I sleep the body feels like it ‚Äòabsorbs‚Äô the stretch and i‚Äôll wake up with lines on my face or my body.

I interpret it as the body ‚Äòinflating‚Äô while i sleep and bones repositioning outwards to a healthier position.

The drowsiness that overcomes you is very very powerful. Coffee does almost nothing against it in my experience.

Sometimes when i‚Äôm driving I‚Äôll be doing my stretches and then have to pull off to the side of the road for a powernap. As I know it‚Äôs just dangerous to try and fight through it while driving.

# I evolved from headaches to tiring myself out

It‚Äôs important to note that a year ago when I did my stretches I typically got less tired but gave myself a mild headache.

Now i rarely get the headaches. It is as if my brain has inflated enough and so it doesn‚Äôt react with headaches to the releasing of compression on it.

So if you‚Äôre not getting tired but are getting some headaches then there‚Äôs a chance you will eventually graduate to getting tired instead.

Or perhaps not.

I have a feeling everyone experiences this recovery process a bit differently.

And that is definitely what i‚Äôm seeing right now when I read through journals. Yes some of the same patterns are there but everyone has their own twist to it.

# What if you‚Äôre not getting tired or headaches?

This does not mean you are not progressing.

Perhaps you‚Äôre still early in the process.

Or perhaps you started with far less issues than I did.

Or perhaps you‚Äôre just not very good at the jaw-body stretch cycle yet and so you don‚Äôt make yourself very tired yet.

In essence I think there are a lot of variables so don‚Äôt worry about it too much.

# Why does it tire you out?

I do not have a scientific explanation. Rather I only have an intuitive one based on what I feel.

To me it feels like you‚Äôre building up pressure in the body with the stretch that the mouthguard and stretches impose‚Ä¶ and then at some point the body ingests it and tries to correct itself.

And this correction process takes a lot of the body‚Äôs energy.

It‚Äôs almost like server maintenance downtime in the software world. The body needs 20‚Äì30 minutes of downtime where it essentially shuts itself down so that it can reboot stronger and healthier.

# Closing thoughts

A number of people have written me saying that they were at times very fatigued and were questioning whether it was perhaps a setback.

So i‚Äôm writing this post to say that it is not. It is normal.

But this process is NOT LINEAR.

It is a weird ride. You will question it at times. I know I did.

>

Do you feel or function better this month than last month?

Over these longer periods my experience is that this process is consistently pretty steady progress. And over even longer periods of time you realize just how amazing it is.

The morning unfolded like a slow, creaky drawbridge. I woke up clinging to the last smoldering seconds of sleep, pried myself from bed like an old man from a coma, and groaned my way into the bathroom. Eyes: half-closed. Brain: on power-save mode. Bowels: evacuated. Water slapped across my face like a wake-up call from Poseidon. Teeth brushed, armpits deodorized, dignity barely intact.

A half-watched YouTube video yapped from the phone speaker. Shorts scrolled. Shirt ironed. Yakult downed. Fragrance sprayed with the vague hope that I might smell like I have control over my life. I mumbled a ""love you, have a good day,"" grabbed my laptop and keys, and descended into the ritual.

Elevator. Car. Morning radio show. The hosts argued about politics like caffeinated toddlers. I judged them quietly with lukewarm intellectual superiority. Missed the good parking spots again. The early bird is a myth.

And then‚Äîthe moment. I walked into the office, rounded the corner, and froze.

There it was.

*My* swivel chair. Black. Leather. A throne carved by time and poorly supported lumbar. And there‚Äî**he** sat.

Trevor.

His lanky frame lounged across my sacred seat, limbs draped like he was modeling for ""Chair Lust Monthly."" Arms slung over *my* armrests. Legs open in the international symbol of workspace dominance. He leaned back, sighing with satisfaction. Reclined. Smug. As if the chair itself had chosen him.

I stared. The chair stared back. I swear it looked ashamed.

""Good morning,"" I said, through my teeth.

""Hey man! Weekend was good,"" Trevor said, wriggling deeper into the seat. *Deeper.* Like he belonged there. Like the chair was conspiring with him to ruin my Monday.

I nodded, turned, and walked to the kitchen before I said something that would require a write-up.

Janice was already there. She caught my eye.

""How was your weekend?""

""Good,"" I barked, flat as uncooked toast.

She launched into her saga‚Äîwine tasting, a hike, a picnic, probably a spiritual awakening atop a mountain. I nodded, stirred my coffee, and listened to the glorious hum of the machine. White noise, blessed distraction.

""Wow,"" I said at a socially appropriate moment. ""Sounds like fun.""

Coffee in hand, I perched on the kitchen bar. My gaze slid sideways, through the glass pane.

There he was. Trevor. Reclining. Smiling. Still there.

The chair didn't move.

It used to squeak when I sat down.

But now? Silence.

Traitor.

**Chapter 2: The Soft Betrayal**

My fingers brushed the surface of the break room couch, slow and deliberate. Soft‚Äîfaintly textured, the fabric yielding just enough to let me dig in. I picked at the bumps in the weave like loose thoughts, absentmindedly scratching at a spot, not enough to ruin it, but enough to feel something real. Stimulation in a world of passive slides and budgetary bullet points.

My headphones sat snug over my ears, the meeting bleating from the laptop screen on the coffee table in front of me. I wasn‚Äôt listening. Not actively. The couch had all my attention‚Äîits quiet comfort, its patient texture. It kept me calm, engaged, present.

‚ÄúDaniel, what do you think?‚Äù

I pivoted up, straightening my back, disturbed from the comfort like a dream shattered seconds before deep sleep. Calm, collected. I knew this moment would come.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCompletely agree. The misunderstanding on the deliverables came down to poor internal communication. The work was already done‚ÄîI completed it last week. But it seems no one else thought to acknowledge it.‚Äù

A pause.

‚ÄúCan you take care of the rest by end of day?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I replied, the words sweetened with professional ease, though my jaw clenched slightly. Doing work twice builds character, I reminded myself.

The meeting ended. I slouched. The couch didn‚Äôt feel right anymore. It wasn‚Äôt the couch‚Äôs fault, but the spell had broken. I pushed off the cushion, heard the soft thud of disengagement, and stood.

No longer craving comfort. Only vengeance. Or at least productivity, which is capitalism‚Äôs version of vengeance.

I walked. Through the office floorplan, past the fake plants and the fake plants.

‚ÄúHey, did you get that report done?‚Äù a voice chirped from a desk.

I paused. Looked him dead in the eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get back to you.‚Äù

And I kept walking.

There it was.

Waiting.

Angled like a trap. Not fully tucked in. Not fully out. Thirty degrees of arrogance. Half a meter from the desk.

One thing that really stood out was the emphasis on DIY projects. They built a simple coffee table from reclaimed wood and created string lighting using repurposed mason jars. It highlighted how much you can achieve with a little creativity and effort.

So far the infection was cleared by antibiotics and ppi meds. The likely cause of infection was pain killers when I had an injury.

After treatment not all the pain was gone on my left side. A burning stabbing pain. This lasted for months. More scans showed no damage or ulcers. So it‚Äôs likely something minor thats healing but feels worse due to stomach acid hurting it. I kept getting pain on and off the trigger food list my doctor gave was too limited

Ive taken antibiotics before without issue, but this infection itself wrecked my stomach and i felt like delays by my doctor to get treatment made it worse 

**Lil over 90 days ago I**

* started diet plan in the L. G. Capellan The Gastritis Healing Book. 

* Pretty much food at a PH level above 4.5 to reduce acid pain
peptobismol or gaviscon first week i still had ppi meds

* completely quitting caffeine not even green tea (substituted with ginger tea when i need a hot drink)

* cutting out gluten foods to prevent stomach inflammation

* every meal has a probiotic yoghurt drink or bowl

* walking more

* sleeping on my side again

**Results**

* had some good and bad weeks but overall it slowly got better. I stopped pills and didn‚Äôt need peptobismol as much only with bad flair ups. Still frustrating its not 100% but ill take better

* cured? No i get ache or wake up with some reflux still but its very mild now. I went from smallest bit of trigger food (chocolate or caffeine) and feeling like i was shanked in side immediately after for weeks. To mild discomfort that goes away. 

* issue: low acidity diet was hard to cut out citrus drinks. Think around 60 day mark i had to get more vitamins and drink more juice for my energy levels. Ginger shots were best morning drink for energy and feeling good without coffee. I should have tried more multivitamins at the start of this diet I think 

* game changer: i took a gut microbe test despite already on probiotic yoghurts and high fibre diet. I was still quite under or deficient. So i upped my fibre intake and took targeted pills for microbes i was missing. I got reaaaal gassy on dried apricots but it felt like this was my guts working and it evened out gas wise. Felt like this jumped my recovery anecdotally. Years time i might do another test to see for any changes

* Plan next: i got used to the food so im keeping diet a bit longer. Ill stick to gluten free most the time. Im going to allow myself more and more (gently) foods i had to avoid. i feel like i might trigger flair up if i do too much too soon. I went out to restaurant yesterday for dim sum and it was great and relief it didn‚Äôt trigger flair up for once

* hope: good weeks and days get longer i heal more and more",4,1750667132.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

1lib4qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_seanauticmarine/comments/1lib4qm/from_warehouse_to_wharf_a_day_in_the_life_of_an/,From Warehouse to Wharf: A Day in the Life of an ECTN Benin Logistics Coordinator,"If you‚Äôve ever wondered what it takes to move cargo from a warehouse to a port in West Africa, specifically Djibouti or Cotonou, the answer lies in the hands of a logistics professional whose day begins before sunrise and ends long after the ships have departed. A day in the life of an ECTN Benin logistics coordinator is a high-stakes blend of documentation, coordination, troubleshooting, and real-time decision-making‚Äîall to ensure that every shipment complies with regulatory mandates like the ECTN.

# The Morning: Coffee, Customs, and Checklists

By 6:00 AM, most ECTN Benin logistics coordinators are already reviewing cargo manifests. These aren‚Äôt just lists of goods‚Äîthey‚Äôre the DNA of each shipment. A single mismatch between the cargo manifest and the bill of lading can delay clearance at the Port of Cotonou. The coordinator‚Äôs first job is to cross-reference all shipping documents, including the commercial invoice, packing list, and insurance certificate. These details must align perfectly with the ECTN (Electronic Cargo Tracking Note) requirements enforced by Benin‚Äôs port authorities.

The ECTN is mandatory for all shipments entering Benin. It tracks cargo from its origin to destination, making it a crucial component of supply chain transparency. Missing or inaccurate data can lead to penalties, delays, or even denied entry at customs. That‚Äôs why the coordinator's attention to detail in the early hours of the day sets the tone for everything that follows.

# Mid-Morning: Liaising with Freight Forwarders and Shippers

By 9:00 AM, calls and emails begin to pour in from freight forwarders, port agents, and shipping lines. The logistics coordinator must communicate with all parties involved to ensure the cargo is progressing through its pre-loading checks. Any discrepancies in cargo weight, HS codes, or origin documentation must be resolved now‚Äînot when the shipment is on the water.

This is also the time when the ECTN Benin application is usually submitted. Many coordinators work with third-party platforms or directly with Benin's designated issuing authorities. The application process requires uploading supporting documents and paying administrative fees. Timing is everything here. Submitting even a few hours late can result in late penalties or missed cut-off times for vessel loading.

# Noon: Crisis Management and Problem Solving

As the day wears on, challenges inevitably arise. Perhaps a shipper sent the wrong invoice format, or a forwarder neglected to include the country of origin on the bill of lading. Or maybe the ECTN Benin number hasn‚Äôt been validated yet by port authorities. At this point, the logistics coordinator becomes a crisis manager.

Speed and precision matter. Coordinators often maintain direct contacts within shipping lines, customs offices, and port inspection teams. A well-placed call can mean the difference between a container being cleared or held indefinitely. In one case study, a logistics team avoided a $12,000 demurrage fee by identifying a data inconsistency just in time and correcting it before the container reached Benin.

# Afternoon: Confirmations and Final Verifications

By 2:00 PM, attention shifts toward confirmation. Has the ECTN Benin number been approved and validated? Has it been sent to the shipping line for manifest submission? Is the shipping agent in Cotonou ready to receive the cargo? The coordinator must now triple-check every detail.

It‚Äôs not unusual for coordinators to coordinate multiple shipments across different time zones. They rely on specialized logistics software to manage complex cargo flows and real-time documentation tracking. For high-volume exporters, automation tools that pull data directly from ERP systems into ECTN portals can reduce human error significantly.

# Late Afternoon: Debriefs and Prepping for Tomorrow

After the final documentation has been submitted and all validations confirmed, the coordinator debriefs with team members. What went well today? What could have gone smoother? Was any shipment flagged by customs? These sessions are short but critical, as they help refine internal workflows.

Finally, the coordinator begins prepping for the next day. This includes reviewing tomorrow‚Äôs outgoing shipments, pre-checking documents, and alerting clients or freight partners about any missing paperwork.

# Beyond the Paperwork: The Human Side of ECTN Coordination

While logistics may appear document-heavy, it‚Äôs ultimately a human operation. Coordinators often develop strong working relationships with customs officers, freight forwarders, and port officials. Trust and communication play a huge role in reducing bottlenecks.

In many West African ports, having a reputation for accuracy and efficiency can earn a coordinator priority handling or faster processing times. The job isn't just about moving cargo‚Äîit's about moving relationships forward, too.

# Real-World Insight: What Coordinators Say

Logistics professionals often cite one key mantra: ""No shipment is routine."" Even with the same port, product, and partners, something new can go wrong every day. One coordinator shared, ""The moment you assume a shipment will go smoothly is the moment you miss a detail.""

Another emphasized the importance of having a ""plan B for everything,"" especially when dealing with international compliance processes like the [**ECTN Benin**](https://ectn-africa.com/ectn-benin). Flexibility, foresight, and finesse are as essential as technical knowledge.

# Final Thoughts: Why Their Role Matters

An ECTN Benin logistics coordinator is more than just a document handler. They are compliance experts, communicators, problem-solvers, and most importantly, the unseen backbone of international trade. Their work ensures that what starts in a warehouse arrives safely and legally at the wharf in Cotonou.

Without them, the entire shipping ecosystem would slow down. They keep the lifeblood of commerce flowing, one validated ECTN at a time.

# FAQs

**Q1: What is the main job of an ECTN Benin logistics coordinator?**  
A: Their main job is to ensure all cargo documentation‚Äîespecially the ECTN‚Äîis accurate, validated, and submitted on time to prevent shipping delays or penalties.

**Q2: Why is the ECTN Benin certificate important?**  
A: It‚Äôs mandatory for all shipments entering Benin and ensures full traceability of goods from origin to destination. Missing or incorrect ECTNs can result in costly customs delays.

**Q3: Can exporters apply for ECTN Benin on their own?**  
A: Yes, but it‚Äôs often handled by specialized logistics coordinators or agents familiar with the specific requirements and procedures.

**Q4: What skills are essential for this job?**  
A: Attention to detail, communication, crisis management, document handling, and deep knowledge of international trade regulations.

**Q5: Does every African country require an ECTN?**  
A: Not all, but many do, especially in West and Central Africa. It‚Äôs important to check each country‚Äôs requirements before shipping.

Like 15 or so years ago, I (48M) worked with a woman for about 6 months. She was like 10-12 years younger than me. It was a small office. We got along well and shared a lot of laughs. Now there was really nothing romantic or flirty about it. I left the job unexpectedly (fired) . I never saw her again but we kinda kept in touch via email here and there.  I‚Äôm a part time photographer so I took some headshots for her and her bf in exchange for her helping me with my resume. So that was it, really. All good. A few years later I determined that she had broken up with that longtime bf. So I just hit her up one day, like .. ‚ÄúHey want to get together for a coffee and catch up or whatever?‚Äù I‚Äôm not going to lie I was kinda interested in hanging out with her as friends and see where it went. Purely based on personality. I mean, she was attractive..but I liked that we clicked in a normal way , so to speak. She never answered my text, so I just left her alone. 
Anyway, fast forward 10 years or so later. She did get married in that time. I wanted to send her a meme or something inocuos. Upon checking her FB timeline, I discovered she passed away in 2023. Turns out she had been struggling for years with a rare GI disease. I had no idea. We had no mutual friends and there was no one else that knew that I knew her.  So I really have no one to connect with on her being gone suddenly. I mean, she was a cool person who evidently never let her illness get her down. Do I just leave some sort of vague comment on her timeline? Do I send her family a card? They have no idea who I am. Do I just forget about the whole thing? It‚Äôs kinda sad. She was young. Thoughts?

It was now baking hot so opted for the Metro back. Now my French isn‚Äôt brilliant but whilst we were queuing for a ticket a gentlemen did try to help get tickets on my phone, didn‚Äôt work but in broken dialects we had a good laugh! No problem though, day passes sorted and we went back to Montmartre for refreshments in a bar. Picked up some baguettes, cheese, ham and a bottle of wine from a supermarket for tea! 

Moulin Rouge was amazing. Tourist trap? Absolutely but we had a great evening and as we‚Äôve planned to go for years it was a big tick in the box. Now though, the star of the show‚Ä¶

Unbeknown to us until someone mentioned it on a previous post, it was the Fete De La Musique which meant there were several DJ‚Äôs setup around our hotel where we danced away until the early hours. Such a good vibe, equally such a shame to read the reports yesterday but at the same time we‚Äôre planning to be back for it at some point

Took the airport bus back from Op√©ra yesterday, a lot easier and meant we could take in some extra sights beforehand on the walk down.

Overall, just amazing! People were super helpful and friendly wherever we went, great food pretty much everywhere you go and just loved every single minute. It was nice not having a schedule and just wandering about, seeing what you bump into and taking it all in. 

We did learn a few things along the way, definitely be back in the near future!!
