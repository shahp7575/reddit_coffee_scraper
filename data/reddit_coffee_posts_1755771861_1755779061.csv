Until this morning. The one thing I need is quiet time first thing in the morning. Even the cat and the dog (German Shepherd , important for later) know don't bother mom until she's on her second cup of coffee.

Because spouse has spent the last 4 years in the bedroom, dog gets all kinds of excited when he comes downstairs. I had just filled my first cup when guess who makes an appearance. At 6am. 

After an hour and a half of him and dog going round and round, he says ""I want to come back as a German Shepherd"". And my first thought was ""Why? So you can be a pain in the a$$ in your next lifetime too?"" 

Then he says ""You ever have some random memory just pop up?"" Well, yeah, we all do. ""I just had one from 70 years ago."" No, please don't .... Its not even 8am yet.

So now my anxiety is through the roof and I'm chain smoking. Have to restart the quit smoking program. Thinking of running away from home, but going to get second cup of coffee first.",1,1755778883.0,CaregiverSupport,0,1.0,False

Do you agree with my old friend Copilot?,"Going to Lahti on a business trip but Lahti is as I understand a smaller town with not maybe a lot to do, so I have the possibility to first stop in have the afternoon in Helsinki. I heard it´s quite nice! I asked copiliot and it said:

# 1. Senate Square & Helsinki Cathedral (30 min)

This is the heart of Helsinki and a must-see. The cathedral is a stunning white neoclassical landmark towering over the square. Walk up the steps for a great view and some memorable photos.

# 2. Esplanade Park & Market Square (30 min)

Stroll along the Esplanade – a beautiful boulevard lined with shops, cafés, and live music in summer. Continue to the Market Square to soak in the city’s vibe, browse colorful stalls, and maybe taste a local treat like *lihapiirakka* or smoked fish.

# 3. Uspenski Cathedral (20 min)

Just a short walk from the Market Square, this impressive red-brick Eastern Orthodox cathedral with golden domes sits on a small hill offering great views of the harbor.

# 4. Quick Coffee or Souvenir Stop (20 min)

Wrap up with a coffee at a local café – try **Café Engel** near Senate Square or **Robert’s Coffee** by the Esplanade. If you want to pick up something uniquely Finnish, check out **Marimekko**, **Iittala**, or a local design shop.



Are you Helsinkies agreeing on that? Or something else to add? If you have some cool museum that is worthwhile? ",1,1755778831.0,helsinki,0,1.0,False

1mw9bfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1mw9bfp/our_weekday_routine_with_puppy/,Our Weekday Routine With Puppy,"Now that we’ve had our puppy for 3 weeks, I feel like we are in a good weekday routine. The first two weeks were rough but this week is going really well and I wanted to share. Feel free to share your routine, or any advice/concerns 

5:45 I get out of bed, use the bathroom, make & drink some of my morning coffee

6am-6:30am get the puppy out of crate, take him outside for potty, & then come inside to do 15-20 minutes of training (crate games, sit, down, place, spin, paw, stay) 

6:30am-6:45am give puppy breakfast and pack lunches while he eats 

6:45am-7:00 individual play/chill time while I get dressed & ready for work. 

7:00-7:15 play time with me (tug, some fetch) 

7:15-7:25 outside potty (if there’s time after potty we will run around the yard) 

7:25 in crate, I leave for work at 7:30

7:30am-4:50 I’m gone at work (don’t worry, puppy gets two potty/play breaks during the day!) 

4:50-5:20 puppy is out of crate playing (& potty break) while I decompress a bit and eat dinner 

5:20-5:40 training session 

5:40-6:30 play time (outside if it’s nice out) both with me and by himself 

6:30-7:00 puppy eats dinner & chills a bit while I shower  

7-8:30 is a mixture between playing with me, maybe another small training session, grooming, individual play while I do household chores, potty breaks, a walk (in the stroller until fully vaxxed) etc 

Anywhere between 8:30 and 9, puppy is in crate for bedtime (don’t worry, he gets a 12:30am potty break) 

I got to bed between 9:30 and 10 

Maybe once or twice a week we go on outings to a pet store, hardware store, dog park (to observe in a stroller, not participate), or a regular park which alters the schedule a bit 

This week, I’ve been focusing on forcing myself to prioritize time for myself, and I think that has been a huge help to my mental health. 

Puppy likes to put EVERYTHING in his mouth, and we are having a hard time with “leave it” & “drop it” 
My biggest worry right now is that he will develop resource guarding since we have to force him to drop things he gets into that he shouldn’t (mulch, socks, etc) he’s really good about staying out of the flower gardens but occasionally there is a stray piece of mulch that somehow made it to the grass.

but then i actually looked at what i was spending trying to manage my adhd brain:

* therapy copays when i cant focus in sessions: $200/month
* coffee shop visits bc i cant work from home: $150/month
* impulse purchases during dopamine seeking episodes: $200/month (dont judge me)

so i was already spending $550/month being a chaotic mess PLUS my adderall prescription

tried the thera expecting nothing... except i started actually finishing my research instead of spending 6 hours reading the same paragraph?? and my advisor noticed i was more engaged in meetings??

2 months later, i go to coffee shops 80% less, and therapy is actually productive bc i can focus long enough to work through issues

net savings: \~$300/month bonus: finally feel like a functional human being

Mom of 2 here, and everyone in our little family is either diagnosed with ADHD or showing clear signs of neurodivergence. Last year was our oldest kid's first year of primary school, and it nearly killed us. 
We are in the US. So school here starts at 7:15 am and is 20 minutes away. Every morning was a battle to get everyone awake and in the car. Every evening was a clusterfuck of overtired tots being forced in to bed before the sun went down. I gained tons of weight using sugary coffee drinks to stay awake. To make matters worst, the school had asinine policies that added hours of prep to my week. 

My kid had the worst of it. Food texture sensitivities kept my kid from eating packed room temperature lunch and school cafeteria offered no vegetarian options aside from PB&J.  Bullying started almost immediately because of her tendency to interrupt and info-dump about history and science. She was dress-coded constantly for wearing soft pants/leggings, the wrong brand of shirt, or no socks (all related to her sensitivities). Every morning I put her in the stiff school-approved khakis, she cried. She went to the school nurse almost daily for anxiety. And the cherry on top of this total lack of sundae: her reading and math scores went down (!) as she realized that lower scores and struggling with lessons resulted more positive, reassuring attention from the teachers. This was how she was learning to mask. 
So we said F this. We have accepted that traditional school does not work for our brains. We are homeschooling. She starts her day at 9 after a hot meal. We found a curriculum that lets us add time to study her special interests. She can interrupt, be loud,  wear what she wants, and be a little know-it-all. 
This is week one of homeschool. It has been time-consuming, expensive, and exhausting. But I haven't needed to ingest 40 oz of sugar vanilla latte, or iron khakis at midnight, or rebuy oodles of lost socks. My kid is so happy learning about ancient China, eating fresh berries, and wearing tie-dye.
I hope this keeps working. I may do an AMA if it does. ",1,1755778511.0,adhdwomen,1,0.67,False

I’m 27, 5’4, fair skin, from Pampanga. I spend a lot of time with books or tucked away in coffee shops, because I enjoy both quiet solitude and meaningful conversations. 

Personality-wise, I fall somewhere between introvert and extrovert. Comfortable in silence, but also at ease sharing thoughts over coffee.

I’ve never been in a relationship before (by choice), but I feel ready now to step out of my usual circle and see what it’s like to connect with someone new. 

I’m drawn to guys who are tall, soft-spoken, emotionally intelligent, and whose eyes disappear when they smile. It’s my weakness. 💕

Hi, 

I applied for several jobs in the Flemish government.

I am now invited to do some online tests. 

Can someone tell me what to expect? 

I did some tests for a remote job with logical questions and I failed. The test was kinda like followed: 

Four colleagues each drank a different beverage during a meeting: tea, coffee, juice, and water. Use the clues to match the drink with the person:
	•	Maria did not drink tea or water.
	•	The person who drank coffee sat next to Ahmed.
	•	Fatima drank water.
	•	Ahmed did not drink juice.

Who drank tea?

A) Fatima
B) Ahmed
C) Maria
D) The fourth person (not named)

⸻

🔷 Question 10: Critical Reasoning

In a survey, 80% of employees said they felt more productive working from home.
The company concludes it should shift all operations to remote work.

Which of the following weakens this conclusion most?

A) 80% of surveyed employees are under 30
B) The company’s core tasks require in-person teamwork
C) Some employees didn’t respond to the survey
D) Most remote workers report higher job satisfaction


Are the tests for the Flemish Government like that? 

Any advice to succeed?

I was honestly overwhelmed opening them – your kindness is unbelievable. Thank you so much to everyone who sends items from our wishlist 💙 We now have more bags, so I can get ahead with packing and add socks to the ones already prepared. We also received one of the clothing rails from our list. My plan is to use two rails with curtains to create a privacy screen for street haircuts. Just because someone is living on the streets doesn’t mean they don’t deserve dignity and privacy. I’ll test it soon (migraine allowing!) and share how it works.

Yesterday also brought my first outdoor haircut ✂️ The wind did its best to feed me some hair 🤣 but the young lad I met was amazing – resilient, funny, and inspiring. You could see the lift in him after his cut. His lovely mum even slipped me money for a coffee, insisting I deserved a treat. Normally every penny goes straight back into the initiative, but this gesture meant the world to me. I’ll be saving that coffee for a quiet moment to sit and breathe 🌿

For now, I’m resting until this migraine eases, then it’s back to sorting bags and the cupboard. I’ve two more shifts before the bank holiday, then some time for personal appointments. Can’t believe August is nearly over!

Maybe it’s all in my head, maybe not, but it bothers me more than it probably should.

I brush twice a day, morning and evening, and usually rinse with water after meals. Because of some receding gums, food tends to get stuck between my teeth, and I’ll admit I don’t floss as often as I should. Still, my overall dental hygiene is pretty decent.

Here’s the thing: if I’m not chewing gum throughout the day, I feel like my breath smells bad. I know coffee doesn’t help, and I smoke (planning to quit soon), which probably makes it worse. But even apart from that, I’m hyper aware of it. I notice bad breath in others really easily, so maybe I’m projecting that onto myself too.

I’d like to stop relying on gum, since it’s not exactly healthy to be chewing it nonstop, but I’m worried my breath will be unbearable without it. Is this something people just deal with as normal? Can breath actually be odorless without gum or mints all day, or am I making a bigger deal out of this than it really is?

I am frustrated with the weight gain I have experienced that is stubborn and won’t come off (10 pounds or so) especially all on the gut. By genetics that’s where all my weight has always been and I have never been overweight. I have been very active since the age of 13. While aging has slowed down my running pace I still run daily around 4 miles and walk an additional 2 miles in the evening or afternoon. I do weights 3 times a week as well. I have modified very little to my diet by cutting out sugar in coffee and refraining from alcohol but this has only made like a 1 lb difference. I tried to increase my activity but my body tells me I’m at my max with running because I get viruses and colds or injuries when I try to increase. I’m wondering if anyone who has had this experience can tell me if the weight came off eventually in their 60s or after the first 10 years of menopause. I might be able to make some more adjustments to my diet but I truly don’t want to do something I know I’m not going to be able to maintain. According to the doctor and blood work I don’t have a thyroid problem however I always had high cholesterol even when I was underweight in my 30s but it was borderline. After menopause my LDL cholesterol went higher so I modified my diet prior to taking meds but it actually went up.

the guy was my high school classmate. nothing happened between us back then because we both had different crushes.

we reconnected in senior high during the pandemic, right before college. that time i formed a little crush on him but didn’t entertain it since he wasn’t my type. our chats eventually stopped because i deleted my instagram (the only platform we talked on).

two years later, in the middle of my 3rd year in college, he messaged to ask how i’ve been, about my program, etc.

december 2024 was the first time he messaged me again since shs. i wasn’t interested in small talk, plus i liked someone else, so the convo was left hanging.

fast forward to february this year, he messaged again. i was still crushing on the guy from december, but i entertained him anyway. we talked for about a week, some of it flirty, then he ghosted me.

i wasn’t offended, just mildly shocked since i only humored his chats. weeks later, he posted his ex on his story, even though back in february he told me they had been broken up for almost a year. i got curious and stalked his fb—turns out he was still posting monthsary speeches as late as october 2024. so clearly he lied. (idk if that’s normal for guys, to not be exact about timelines.) i just let it slide and moved on.

he messaged three times between late july and early august. my replies were short and i left him on delivered.

the fourth time, he asked me out for a coffee date. it didn’t happen because i was busy cleaning, so i owed him one.

the next day, we finally went on a lunch date. he was sweet and great. after that, we decided to be bf/gf.

i asked him about his ex and the stories i saw. he joked about lying when he said they broke up a year ago. then he admitted they got back together to try again, but broke up around march–april because they had fallen out of love (his words).

this was my first ever serious relationship. before him, i only had hookups and flings since no one seemed to want something real. so i tried to be the “perfect girlfriend.”

at first, he was sweet and we got along both in person and over chats.

two weeks later, i noticed his chats getting cold, though in person he was still clingy and sweet. i let it pass because when i pointed it out, he said he was just having a bad day and didn’t want me to be affected.

still, chat matters to me, especially since we don’t see each other every day. i just wanted reassurance that we were okay.

the last time i brought up his cold chats, it ended in a breakup. first, he said he was having a depressive episode. then he added that college was stressing him out—his thesis, acads, graduation requirements—and he couldn’t focus, so he didn’t want anyone bothering him.

i responded understandingly to all of it. but when he said he didn’t want to be bothered, i asked if that meant breaking up or a cool-off where i just wouldn’t chat him while he was busy.

he said to break up.

at that point, i wondered if he was just waiting for me to bring it up.

so i let him go and restricted him.

i didn’t know what to say, even now. he was my first boyfriend. i introduced him to my friends (embarrassing now), and he claimed to have introduced me to his (though i never met them—only his relatives).

the relationship didn’t even last a month. fuck me.

so my question is: do you think he genuinely liked me, or did he just play me? he said he wanted to focus on academics, but honestly, i don’t want to trust him anymore.

btw, he said ily after our first date... i didn't believe him but now when i think about it, maybe he was love bombing me? and i admit i was not asking the right questions to him about his past relationship. 

aside from the reasons he gave, i can’t help but overthink these 3 things:
• he was still in love with his ex (idc what he said)
• he started liking another girl
• he got turned off by me or just didn’t want me anymore

TLDR if this is too long: 21f, first serious relationship. dated my hs classmate (21m) after reconnecting. he lied about his ex, ghosted me once before, then came back and we became official after one lunch date. he was sweet in person but cold over text, which bothered me. when i brought it up, he said he was depressed/stressed with thesis and didn’t want to be bothered. i asked if that meant cool off or breakup, he chose breakup. relationship didn’t even last a month. now i can’t stop wondering if he ever really liked me or just played me.",1,1755777379.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1mw8uax,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1mw8uax/a_skeleton_in_the_closet/,A Skeleton in the Closet,"It was a normal morning until Craig opened his closet and found a skeleton inside.



Beneath his shirts, crumpled lifelessly between a stack of old shoe boxes and a dusty suitcase, was a skeleton.



Craig looked at the pile of bones, frantic questions running through his head. This had to make sense, but he just couldn’t connect what he was seeing with a logical answer.



*She must have been pretty*, Craig thought, surprising himself. It was just a bunch of bones. He didn’t even know if it was a woman.



He shook the thought away and focused on the most pressing issue. The skeleton couldn’t stay here, and Craig doubted the police would believe she had simply appeared. He had ample land, though, and finding a place to bury her wouldn’t be a problem.



This could stay a secret.



The bones fit snugly in the suitcase. Digging the hole was a chore, but before long the dirt was packed tight again and he could move on with his day. Everything could go back to normal.



The next morning, Craig was shocked to find that, once again, there was a skeleton in his closet. It sat on the floor draped in a blood-stained sundress.



*I burned that dress,* Craig thought as old memories resurfaced, carrying an awful secret.



He stuffed the bones in a trash bag and went back to the spot where he had buried yesterday’s skeleton. He dug the same hole, uncovering his suitcase. It was empty, so he placed the skeleton and the dress inside and filled the hole again.



All day his thoughts drifted back to the skeleton. He would catch himself staring off towards where he buried her, wondering if she was still there. In bed he tossed and turned, jumping at every bump in the night.



*She is dead and buried*, he repeated like a lullaby, easing his troubled mind to sleep.



To his relief, the morning light revealed a closet free of bones. Just shirts and old boxes, a perfectly normal closet. With a bounce in his step, he made his way downstairs to start the day with some coffee.



His hope for the day shriveled as he entered the kitchen.



The skeleton was seated at his table, her dress dripping with old blood. She stared at him with green eyes nestled deep in bony sockets, silently hurling curses. Her glare accused him, vilified him, reflected his darkest shame. Craig was so lost in those swirling pools of guilt that he didn’t notice his shotgun held in the revenant’s hands.



His knees buckled under the weight of his conscience. Barely catching himself on the table, he lowered into the seat next to her. His heart wept as he looked into her eyes.



She leaned towards him, softly tucking the barrel of the gun under his chin. Shaking, he wrapped his finger around the trigger.



Her eyes begged him for justice.



Craig whispered a final confession and squeezed the trigger.",2,1755777375.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Ever walked into a store, eyed a new iPhone, and winced at the price tag? Or maybe your weekly grocery run—coffee, tomatoes, even rice—feels like a budget buster? Welcome to 2025, where U.S. [tariffs](https://thetake.net/tag/tariffs/) on countries like China, Canada, and Mexico (ranging from 15% to 50%) are driving up costs for everything from tech gadgets to your dinner table. These extra taxes on imports are reshaping how Americans shop, eat, and live. So, what’s the deal, and why is everyone buzzing about it on X?

Tariffs are supposed to shield local businesses by making foreign goods pricier. But in reality, consumers often end up paying the difference. On X, the frustration is palpable. One user vents, “Coffee prices jumped 25% last month because Brazilian beans now cost more!” (@TraceyRyniec). Another points out that Cava restaurants hiked prices on basmati rice from India due to a 50% tariff. Mexican tomatoes, a staple in many American kitchens, aren’t spared either—double-digit tariffs have sent their prices soaring. The result? Your grocery cart is heavier on your wallet, with everyday items like produce and pantry staples costing more than ever.

So, I call:   
I call you disingenuous,   
I call out your pretense.

I fiercely protest.

Because, you tread   
on my hours unslept,   
poured on this miserable art,   
the breaths I wasted,   
the coffees I drowned in,   
the lamps still lit at three,   
And soil this religiously hefty expense.

The one who said of doing a better job,   
leaving ruins instead—

The garden I tended to,   
split,   
all bleak but “thy” damned weeds.

I keep replaying it in my head, wondering if I did the right thing or if I accidentally stepped into something I was never supposed to be part of.

I was late for my usual train. Only by thirty seconds. I had done everything on time: left work at the same hour, grabbed my coffee from the same shop, walked the same route I always take. But just before reaching the station, my phone slipped from my hand and cracked on the pavement.

I stopped to pick it up. That delay was enough to miss the train by seconds.

That small mistake is the only reason I saw him.

He was standing at the far end of the platform. At first, he seemed like any other commuter. But the longer I watched, the stranger it felt.

He was pacing, mumbling to himself. His hands were shaking. And even though the platform was not empty, no one else seemed to notice him. People scrolled through their phones, talked softly, checked their watches, but not one person looked in his direction.

Then the next train’s lights appeared in the distance.


He stepped closer to the edge, just a little too close. Before I even realized what I was doing, I yelled, “Hey, man!”

He flinched and turned toward me. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes wide like I had startled him out of something. Then he whispered, softly but clearly enough for me to hear:

“You were not supposed to be here.”

The train roared past, and in that instant, I turned to glance at it. When I looked back, he was gone. Not walking away, not blending into the crowd. Just gone.


I stood there for ten more minutes, staring at the spot where he had been.

When I got home, everything felt wrong. My apartment felt colder. The shadows seemed deeper. I kept getting the feeling that someone was standing just out of sight, watching me.


Yesterday, I went back to the station and asked around. No one had seen him. I described his appearance: mid-thirties, brown jacket, black sneakers, average build. The security guard just shook his head and said, “Nobody like that was here that night.”

Then something even stranger started happening. Small things in my apartment have been off.

A chair slightly moved. My keys sitting on the counter instead of the table. My phone unplugged from the charger in the morning.

But this morning, I noticed something that made my stomach drop. My phone, the one that cracked when I dropped it, the reason I missed that train, was sitting on my nightstand completely fixed. No cracks. No scratches. Like it had never been broken.


I do not know if I saved someone’s life or if I interfered with something I was never supposed to witness.

But I cannot shake this feeling that someone is making sure I will not miss the next train.

1mw8ovl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOexistenceNofYou_Me/comments/1mw8ovl/lilithium_chapter_8/,Lilith-ium Chapter 8,"***Chapter 8 - Ars Domini Veritas***

 Art always had a mysterious effect on people… Music, drawing, carving, singing, many other forms it took.

 Fantasy in a way was a purer form, twisting of the person's own view, perception instead of the world.

 Thaumaturgy, Arcane, Mystery, Magecraft, Magic. It took so many forms, names, systems…
 She looked at me with a small, sweet yet also smirk-like smile as I watched her. How flowers not supposed to bloom did, in winter. How saplings grew so so easily. How things worked without external power sources.

 We spent plenty of time together and I recalled other things. Cake and how it shifted to my/her/our focused thought of how it should taste. How her snap could becalm my thoughts and stabilize the spirit. The ferris wheel turning in a long abandoned park. 

 I asked and she only smiled, happy to finally have me ask, to finally see my need to know more about her/myself? 

---

 Soul… it burns like a spark, it grows like a tree, it hardens and changes under pressure like how diamonds are born.

 It can crumble, it can rot, it can sing and scream and be silent, it can glow and eat away the light. 

 It affects the body and mind, spirit and emotions. In return they do it too. They are pressure and material, they are experience and pathway for what tempers/rots/damages/heals…

 It can become a Source, a Spark, engine running of mere fact of soul's own Existence.

 Other pieces can change, become better and store more, conduct more easily, generate faster in their own ways…

---

 She sits on the sand, I do too. Back to back. I can feel her heartbeat if only faintly/like a drum, in synchrony with my own.

 It takes minutes/seconds/eternity? I feel something. Not blood running through the veins under pressure of the organ associated with love, not electrical current conducted by the nervous system, not anything so close to the surface/truly there.

 It flows, it feels like something streaming through you. It touches yet goes through without resistance. 

 I can feel… something else. Another flow. Warm, caring, touch like fluffy cat fur colored in black/red/snow white with memory of chocolate cake shaped like strawberry one.

 She chuckles when I open my eyes. Lilith giggles at my question of how my own mana, light and heat of the Spark, feel?

 Her touch is gentle. There isn't any hint of judgment in her eyes. She answers.

 Bloody metallic taste, touch like half finished statue made from iridescent fragments of glass and skeleton of silver, scales warmed only a little by sun, hungry/yearning/longing.

 It fits. After all what else a lone soul that wouldn't mind bleeding its own very vessel would be like? What else would dreamers' power be like if not glass? Purity buried deep and numberless chaotic dreams to shield a core…

---

 We continue our lesson. It isn't anything grand, just a lecture spoken by her excited voice, with her ruby eyes focused on me. But I listen carefully.

 The more subjective wills one opposes the harder change is to enact, depending on the willpower of each side it is.

 The more understanding you have the easier it is to do. Be it in the rules of your current surrounding reality or one you wish to build.

 Age matters but more as measurements of experience for things and individuals. Ability to hold comprehension and accumulate memory, strengthen the soul as a source of both energy and will.

 That's why it can take on so many forms and limitations in a way…

---

 At home I focus on flowers, specifically a glass statue made from multiple glass flowers Lilith made. It is beautiful yet she always said she was sad these flowers couldn't fully bloom, as all were made half shut and without colors of their own, just transparent.

 I walk down the staircase to see her brewing tea, without using hands at all, ingredients simply dance up the glass teapot surface as water inside boils.

 It takes me a few moments/perhaps a minute/unkn&w# to finally focus. The feelings for her, the memory of flowers blooming, the experience of shaping and staining glass with colors.

 Lilith turns and… stares. She gently takes a bouquet of bright red roses, with a few white ones mixed in, into her hands. She runs her fingers along the bright emerald still partially transparent leaves.

 A snap of her fingers… I chuckle seeing a chocolate cake, shaped like strawberry cake, appear on the glass coffee table. Perhaps there are some actual strawberries inside?

---

[ So that's chapter 8. What are your thoughts on it? I'll be happy to read your comments. 

 It was a bit more personal than those previous and I'm curious, what do you think your own energy would feel like to touch/see/taste/sense?

 And yes there will be further cases of esoteric/mystic power uses in future chapters. They are too useful in writing to not include, plus work with Lilith very well.

 Before someone may ask, I am mostly inspired by a wild mixture of Nasuverse, Elder Scrolls, Full Metal Alchemist, Witcher, Black Clover, Return's Magic should be special and multiple other magic systems. 
 Sadly some books I drew inspiration from never got english translation so their names are unlikely to be known beyond russian language speaking community.

 Name of this chapter translates as “Master's Art is Truth” from Latin.

1mw8lxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1mw8lxv/the_fracture/,The fracture,"Part I: Who I Am

I’ve always been the grounded one in the group—the one who laughs last but thinks first.
My name is Ellis Maddox. 27. Architect.
Order comforts me. Blueprints, clean lines, symmetry—they give shape to a world that rarely makes sense.

I don’t drink much. I don’t like noise. I don’t like surprises.
And yet, somehow, I agreed to a cabin trip with the others.

We were celebrating a break—someone’s engagement, I think. Or maybe just the end of summer.
But I can’t remember now.

Not clearly.

Part II: The Others

1. Kayla – My oldest friend. A medic. She’s sharp, but she’s been off lately. Zoning out mid-sentence, forgetting things she just said. She laughs it off, but I’ve seen her hands shake when she thinks no one’s looking.

2. Marcus – The funny one. Always with a story, always with a smirk. He’s the glue, in a way. But he hides behind humor—like he’s afraid of silence. Afraid of thinking too long.

3. Dani – My ex. We broke up over a year ago, but somehow we’re still friends. Kind of. She reads people too well. Knows what you’re feeling before you do. That used to comfort me. Now it unnerves me. Sometimes I catch her looking at me like she’s expecting something—something I’m supposed to remember.

Part III: The Beginning of the End

The cabin is buried deep in the woods, five hours from the city, no signal, no distractions. That’s the point, I guess.
“Disconnect to reconnect,” Kayla said.
But I don’t remember agreeing. I don’t remember packing.
I just remember… being here.

It started the first night.
The power flickered. The air felt heavy, like it was pressing against my skin. The others laughed it off, but I kept hearing… something. Not footsteps, exactly. More like… repetition. Like something rehearsing the idea of being alive.

Part IV: The Fracture

The days feel disjointed now. I’ll wake up, and the coffee’s already brewed, even though no one claims to have made it.
I found a note in my handwriting that I don’t remember writing:
“Don’t trust the mirrors.”

At first, I thought I was sleepwalking. But then Marcus said he saw me outside last night—just standing there under the trees, staring up at the cabin.
I never left the bed.

Dani doesn’t act surprised. She just watches me, like she’s waiting for something to click.
Like I’ve done this before.

Part V: Mind Twists Begin

Things are starting to repeat.
Kayla told the same story at dinner three nights in a row—but swears it’s the first time.
Marcus asked me the same question twice within an hour:
“Do you remember what really happened to us?”

I told him to stop screwing with me. He just smiled.
“Maybe you’re the one screwing with us.”

Part VI: Theories That Don’t Make Sense (But Might)
	1.	I’m in a loop.
Not a time loop, exactly. More like a mental one. Like I’m trapped inside the memory of a trip I took once—but pieces are missing, corrupted.
	2.	One of them isn’t real.
Someone feels… off. Dani says I’m projecting. But then I caught Kayla’s reflection not moving in sync with her.
	3.	None of this is real.
The cabin. The friends. My self.
What if I’m still in the city, in a hospital bed, in a coma?
What if this is my mind’s way of buffering pain, hiding trauma?
	4.	I did something.
Something I can’t live with. And this is the punishment—reliving a twisted version of it until I remember.

Part VII: Cracks in Myself

Last night, I found a blueprint on the table.
It was a layout of the cabin—but not the one we’re staying in.
It was different. It had a basement.
We don’t have a basement.
Except now… we do.

I opened the door behind the pantry today and found stairs that weren’t there before.
Cold, damp steps.
Leading down.

I’m afraid to go down there.
I think I already have.
I think I keep doing it.

And each time, I forget. Each time, I come back a little… less.

Part VIII: Descent

The others were still asleep when I opened the hidden door again.
No creak. No chill. Just a gaping dark mouth at the base of the pantry, like it had always been there—waiting for me to remember it.

I counted the steps out loud as I went down. Thirty-seven.
But halfway, they stopped echoing.

The staircase just… ended.
Not into a room. Not into dirt.
Just into more hallway—cold cement walls, flickering lights overhead.

I should have turned back.
But something in me said I’d already been here before.

And something else whispered:

“You need to finish it this time.”

Part IX: Memories That Aren’t Mine

The hallway was lined with doors.
All identical.
No numbers. No knobs. Just a single word carved into each in small, perfect script.

GUILT
CHOICE
TRUTH
ELLIS

I stopped at that last one.
It wasn’t carved.
It was burned in.

I pressed my hand against the surface. Cold.
Then suddenly—warm.

Like the door had a pulse.

Behind me, I heard my own voice whisper:

“You made us real. Now face what you did.”

Part X: Theories Twist Tighter

I used to think I was the victim of whatever this place is.
But what if I’m the architect of it?
What if I didn’t just design buildings—what if I designed this whole twisted pocket reality to protect myself from something I couldn’t handle?

A mental structure.
A safe house for a fractured mind.

The blueprints. The repetition. The unnatural symmetry of this place.

What if I built this whole prison…
to forget?

Part XI: Friend or Construct?

When I came back upstairs, the others were sitting at the table.
Silent. Not eating. Just staring at me.

Kayla finally spoke.

“You opened it, didn’t you?”

I nodded.

Marcus shook his head slowly. “You always do.”

I asked them—begged them—to tell me the truth.
Dani stood up, came close, placed a hand on my chest.

“It’s not that we’re fake, Ellis. It’s that you made us too real. That’s why you can’t let go.”

Then she whispered:

“Do you remember the fire?”

Part XII: The Flash

A house.
Not the cabin.
My first solo project.

I see myself there, screaming for someone inside. The flames are too high.
Three people trapped.
My friends.
My team.

They were real once.

But I couldn’t save them.

I blamed the contractor. The design. God.
But deep down… I knew it was my miscalculation. My structure. My ego.

So I came here.
Into the version of that house I could control.

And I rebuilt them.

Kayla. Marcus. Dani.

They’re not ghosts.
They’re guilt echoes.
Perfectly simulated fragments of who they were.

But they remember.

And they want me to stop living in the replica.

Part XIII: The Final Door

Tonight, they tell me I have to make a choice.

Stay in the loop.
Stay in the cabin.
Keep pretending.

Or walk through the last door—the one labeled TRUTH.

But they warn me:
If I do, the world I’ve built burns—for good.

And they’ll be gone with it.

No more laughter. No more dinners.
No more pretending we’re all okay.

Just me.
Alone.
In a world where they died because of me.

Part XIV: TRUTH

I stood before the door, my hand trembling just above the surface.

The others were silent. Watching.

Kayla had tears in her eyes—maybe from the smoke of the fire I hadn’t remembered until now. Or maybe from something deeper. A goodbye we both knew was coming.

Marcus gave a sad smile. “You always had to know. That was the problem with you, Ellis.”

Dani didn’t speak. She just nodded.
And I felt everything she didn’t say land like a weight in my chest.

I took a breath.

Then I opened the door.

Part XV: The Collapse

It wasn’t a door.

It was a mirror.

And it shattered the moment I touched it.

I fell.

Not physically. Psychologically.
Through floors of memory I’d buried beneath blueprint lines and fake smiles.

I saw it all.

⸻

The Fire.

A design flaw. A support beam too close to the fuel line.

It was my mistake.

Kayla, Marcus, Dani—all part of my team. We were celebrating the project’s opening night. I was proud. Drunk on ambition.

When the explosion hit, I was outside.

They weren’t.

⸻

The Trial.

I was never charged. “Freak accident,” they said.
But I knew better.
And I couldn’t live with it.

So I didn’t.

⸻

The Build.

I retreated inward.
Built the cabin in my mind—the perfect reconstruction.
And inside it, I recreated them.
Gave them personalities, laughter, flaws.
Gave myself a world where they forgave me.

But they weren’t just echoes.
They evolved.

They remembered.

And they’ve been waiting all this time for me to finally let go.

⸻

Part XVI: Waking Up

I opened my eyes to white light.

Hospital ceiling.
IV in my arm.
My mouth dry. My mind sharp. Real.

A voice: “Ellis? Can you hear me?”

I turned. A nurse. Real. Solid. No flicker.

“Welcome back,” she said. “You’ve been under for a long time.”

“How long?” I croaked.

She glanced at her chart. “Eighteen months.”

⸻

Part XVII: The World That Waited

I’m walking again. Slowly. One foot in front of the other.

My license is suspended. My firm dissolved.
But I’m alive.

And they’re not.

Every day I wake up, the guilt sits beside me.
But I sit beside it now.

I talk to Dani when I drink my coffee.
I hear Marcus when a joke pops into my head.
I feel Kayla’s presence in my silence.

They’re gone.

But they’re also part of me—the parts that refuse to let pain make me hollow.

Final Chapter: Embers

Six months out of the coma.

I don’t dream about the cabin anymore.
Not because it’s gone, but because I finally left it.

Some days, though, I catch a flicker in the mirror—just for a second. Dani brushing her hair behind her ear. Marcus smirking like he just made a joke. Kayla’s eyes full of concern, like I’m forgetting something again.

They’re not ghosts. They’re not hallucinations.
They’re reminders.
Anchors.

⸻

I went to the memorial last week.

The company never rebuilt the site. It’s fenced off. Charred beams still mark the shape of what once stood there.

A plaque reads:

“In memory of those we lost on the night the sky burned.”

I left flowers.
And beneath the bouquet, a note.

“I remember now.
I see you clearly.
I built a perfect world to escape you.
But it was your pain that brought me back.”

⸻

Facing the Families

It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.

Kayla’s mother wouldn’t look at me.
Marcus’s brother punched me in the chest, once—then cried into my shoulder.
Dani’s father asked only one question:

“Was she happy, in the end?”

I couldn’t answer at first. My throat closed.
Then I said: “She was trying to forgive me. That’s more than I deserved.”

He nodded. “Then she died the way she lived.”

⸻

Reconstruction

I don’t design buildings anymore.

Not yet.

Instead, I volunteer. I speak to architecture students about safety, ethics, accountability. The importance of owning your mistakes before they become permanent. Before they start breathing.

And sometimes, when no one’s around, I sketch the cabin again.
Not as it was in my mind. Not symmetrical or pristine.
This time, it’s flawed.
Real.
Lived-in.

And it doesn’t have a basement.

⸻

Closure

Grief is a haunting.
It lingers in doorways. In coffee mugs. In songs you didn’t know meant anything—until they play again, when you’re alone.

But truth?

Truth is what happens when the haunting stops being a curse…
and starts becoming a conversation.

⸻

Final Lines

I live in a small apartment now. No mirrors in the bedroom.
But every morning, I wake up, drink my coffee, and whisper to the quiet:

“I remember you.
I’m still here because of you.
And I won’t build another lie to hide behind.”

And somewhere, I like to believe they hear me.
And in their own way…
They smile.",1,1755776692.0,story,1,1.0,False
1mw8le9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mw8le9/aita_for_getting_involved_with_my_abuser/,AITA for getting involved with my abuser?,"Hello everyone. This post is about something that happened to me fice years ago (I was 26f at then). I still wake up sometimes feeling confused about it, so I'll open it with the world.

Six years ago I began a ""course of therapy"" with a group of unknown people, as I was a recently graduated psychology and wanted to expand my experience. The group was not integrated by psychologists: participants and teachers were normal people. It is similar to Gestalt groups. I later discovered sectary traits and left. Before you read, you need to know I was really naive and had no discernment in that moment. You'll read things that seems pretty obvious, and are pretty obvious even for me now, but they weren't at the time and led me to deep pain.

There was a man (46y) that seemed a good person. He was one of the classmates. He also was from my same town, so he offered to take me in car any time we had the course and I accepted because, most of times, the course ended so late that I would lost the last train to home. In the travels we knew each other and he confessed he was physically and psychologicsly abused by her wife. At that point I was sad about him and couldn't understand how his wife would hurt him. I encouraged him to look after his wellbeing and seek therapy. I didn't not say him how to act because, as a psychologist, I knew I had 0 other information and I can't take others decisions. And I was not at work, but at my daily life. The car travels became a space where he vented and told me how he felt about everything. I heard him as a way to help him in any way I could. At that point I thought it was the right thing to support an abused person. How naive I was.

Soon I spotted uncomfortable and weird things. Sometimes he talked to me in the car and put his hand on my knee. I felt super uncomfortable but was really bad at setting boundaries, so my way to escape was saying ""oh, it's too late, I have to go"" and left the car. It increased, as he began to give me expensive gifts that I refused to take. He did insisted a lot and I ended taking the gifts, but feeling guilty and uncomfortable. He began to propose me to grab some coffee and wanted to see me outside the course. I used sll the excuses I could to avoid them most of the time. I felt more uncomfortable but, at the same time, I felt guilt. I didn't want to left an abused person alone and I thought these behaviors were caused by his confusion. ""He's not acting normal, and a lot of abused person have strange and desperate behaviors"". But a good person wouldn't left them in their vulnerable times. How could I left someone that was treating me ""so well"", helping me with the car travels, just because I couldn't handle his gifts and desperate behaviors in a vulnerable time? (yes, it's painful to see how naive I was). I told my ""therapist"" (not a real therapist, but one of the professors of the course) how I felt and she told me he has obvious manipulative behavior (she was right) and probably was romantically interested. I couldn't even believe it. He was 20 years older than me and I could be his daughter. I was shocked and refused to believe, but I agreed with her that something strange was happening, so I took a bit of space and was less available for him.

His interest increased and his intentions were clear after two actions. First he tried to kiss me in one of the car travels, which I frontally refused, got angry at him, and did not talk to him in a while. I felt nauseous of a married man trying to have something with me, and I felt horrible that the wife was abusing him. At that point I thought both were toxic and didn't want to be involved in their problems. Time after he apologised, again, and I forgave him. But days after, he wrote a ""dirty poetry message"" to me about me in my bathing time. It was gross, but again apologised and I, stupidly, accepted the apology. At that point, the wife was suspicious (and she was right!!) and he realised that his tactics weren't working. I didn't feel anything for him and I would never be with a married man. I had and have my principles. My mistake was not to cut contact radically because of the guilt of being a ""bad person"" for lefting and abused person alone.

He then asked me straigthlly if I would be with him if he divorced. My answer was more clear: no. If he wanted to divorce to end the alledged abuse, that good for him. But for me? Nope. I didn't want to be the reason of a divorce, but he anyway asked for divorce that same week. At that point I knew I was in the middle of a big problem but I didn't know how to go out without being the bad of the story.

Weeks after he moved to a new home that, surprise, was one street appart from my home. He insisted a lot of times that wanted to show me his new house. He insisted that I'm the only one who knew his complex situation and needed my support, and showing his house was something that would make him feel better because waw his new life. I said no endless times. Then, one of the days we came back from the course, he insisted. I said no again. The he parked in front of his door. He said that it would be just 5 minutes. I finally entered thinking he would stop insisting if I was just a couple of minutes, and I wouldn't feel more pressured. I didn't know how to set more boundaries at that point, because it was clear that the word ""no"" repeated several times wasn't enought. I entered, saw the house. ""Cool, I'm happy for you, now I have to go"". Then he insisted in taking some tea and sit in the sofa and I said no, but he again insisted.

At that point I felt trapped. I felt unable to scape what was happening. I remember feeling cold (I'm a person that barely feels cold even at low temperatures), dispersonalised, and paralised. That night is blurred in mind. He noticed I was shaking and bring me a blanket!!! I didn't want it and insisted to go, but he anyway gave it to me. I surrounded myself in the blacked as tight as I could, feeling protected by this ""thin"" barrier I had. I sit in the sofa, fully covered in the blanket, stiff as a stick, looking to nowhere. He them sit snd got closet. I was paralised despite I wanted to run so hard. He then tried to hug and kiss me and I said no for the 15th time. He said it was because I had a look that seems to ask him for kissing, and I said NO (I recently discovered I'm neurodivergent, with TDAH, giftness and autist phenothype, and I struggle with looking people in the eyes. Or I avoid it, or I look so directly that people thinks I'm flirting and is not my intention!!!). I also said that no matter what, he was not allowed to kiss me or even touch me. He ignored me, as it was usually at that point, and began to caress my legs. I was extremelly paralised while avoiding to look at him. He then went up and touched my ""triangle of Venus"". Then something inside of me, moved by my disgust for him and, now, my own body, I got up violently and said I would left and how he DARED to touch me. He said that it was just a mistake (he even laughted as if nothing happened, which make me really mad), that he wanted to touch my belly gently. I remembered him that I said I wanted NO contact and I didn't believed his shit of excuse. I left and went home and felt the urge to wash myself multiple times, but the disgust and urge to cry intensified. I wrote my therapist abour what happened and she helped me the next day. The whole group of professors decided to protect me and force him to left the course. I felt protected.

However, the next days until the following class were a hell to me. The man wrote me several times to apologise. It's hardly to me to admit that I was so confused that the ""apologies"" were working. I was an emotional mess of disgust, sadness, pain, rage and fear. I began to ruminate really hard and questioning myself. I truly questioned myself and even wondered if he ""was right"" and I felt something and didn't knew it. I questioned all. 

His texts were more manipulative every day. He said how I could left him after all he did for me. He had a mistake but all had mistakes and still deserve another chance. But they worked, as I felt a shitty person even knowing that he wasn't right in that. The day of the class, we saw each other from the distance. The professors banned him for approaching me. We were called in private later. He was recriminated and said that was deceived because no one wanted to know his version and they treated him like a criminal. I felt a huge guilt, as if I were the main culprit of this situation and he was my victim. The professors encouraged me not to talk and rely the situation on them, but I begged to talk ad I wanted to do things at my own way (huge error). I wanted to close this ""peacefully"" and humanly because, in my mind, the abuse was coupled with all the help and good actions he did for me, which kept me in a hug confusion. I still could believe he wasn't the good person he seemed. So I said things to close, saying that I don't think is a bad person, and that he treated me well when didn't do any of this, and I hoped he was happy. I was trying to reduce the conflict as much as I could, but it was a huge error. He interpreted then that were the professors, not me, who were separating us. After all, I had the bad luck to going back to the car my mom lend me, and we crossed. He talked, began to cry, and said he loved me and never tried to hurt me, and that he deeply thought I felt the same despite the thousand ""no"" I said. I fell for that shit of excuse and, finally, he got what he wanted: me. My confussion led to euphoria, to self disgust. I then developed feelings, but more trsumatic than romantic. The professors were confused and began to question my version (I don't blane them). I still blame myself for not being strong and don't fall.

Of course, the relationship was toxic as fuck. He began to love bombing me hard at the same time he apologised (but blaming me of everything), of course. Abuse came soon after: jealousy of my friendships (males and females) because they were good snd supportive, ignoring me, all the talkings were about himself, critisizing my clothes or make up, admiting that the felt old and thought I would left him, then proceding to make me feel ugly, spoting my flaws constantly, cold shoulder behaviors (as not corresponding a hug, but saying all was good between us when I asked why), saying he's realising I'm too young for him (being him who CHASED AFTER ME FOR ALMOST ONE YEAR), pushing me to eat junk food despite I did a huge effort years ago to lose 24kgs, and lowering my self-esteem to feel better (he was that confident I would not left him that even admitted that he was lowering my self-esteem to not feel inferior to me). I began to lost my light and spark so quick. I regained 28 kgs that altered my body forever. He even cheated on me and confessed he had done it before in the marriage (saying it was all the fault of the exwife). He even fucked with prostitutes while married with two little children. He even confused my name a lot of times and called me by his daughter's name several times (even in bed context), with smelled fishy and gross for me. I did my best for all to work, as I refused to think all will end after all the pain and the efforts I did to overcome the pain and confussion. The more I did, the worst he treated me.

In the therapy group, I vented without revealing to the other classmates who was the person that was hurting me. The profesors insisted in front of the group that I must tell them, or otherwise I'm lying to the whole group. I feel like shit because I didn't want to hurt anyone and I'm not a lier, but I was told that in front of everyone. I felt pressed and pushed not only by the man, but by the group. The passed of trying to protect me to force me to act as they thought I should act, at their times and in their ways.

I finally end up the relationship for my own mental health, as I painfully accepted that all of this wouldn't have happened if I had left when I could, before all the abuse. It was my fault to end like this. It took me several tries because we had comes and backs, and he loved bombing me again and we meet ""by chance"" in a lot of places (then I thought it was destiny, now I think he was following me).

A year after I was finally was free. Then I began my now fiance. We began a beautiful relationship, more beautiful than I ever expected and I healed woth a lot of self-worth to be a healthy and loving partner for him. Like another year after, my fisnce questioned his sexuality and that shaked our relationship. At the same exact time, as if he could smell it, the guy came back and love bombed me hard. I not only felt confused. The crazy part is I felt super guilty for being with my partner, as if I were cheating on my EX and I truly belonged to him. At that point my fiance and I ended because he didn't wanted to hurt me due to his confussion about his sexuality. 

One day my ex and I crossed in the street and he later called me. He told me all that I wanted to hear when I was in the relationship to hold accountability of his acts. Then we met and he kisses me after ""only wanting to be a friend"". I felt a horrible person because I had deep feelings for my fiance and I expected that we could come back. I left before my ex could get me again in his web and, the next day, I took a flight for research stay in a university of thousands of km appart from home. I was still in contact with my fiance as we didn't only were a good couple, but really good friends. I didn't want to left him alone with his problem, and he supported me with what happened about my ex. My ex, of course, tried to make me return with him but his hot and cold behavior didn't work. He even attacked my fiance put of jealousy and that was the worst decision he took. All the rage I didn't allowed myself to feel all the years before was concentrated in me in that moment. I was done with the shit. My fiance is untouchable. I insulted him, told him the shitty person he was, and said I would finally expose him after years of protecting his image. Finally I didn't expose him to our common group, but went to hard no contact FINALLY. He tried to contact but I ignored him as if he didn't was still alive. I noticed a lot of the people in common began to act in strange ways and distanced from nowhere. So I distanced myself until my back to home three months after. Those month changed my life and changed me deeply. At my comeback, I confronted the group to know what was happening and my professors said I must tell all what happened to them, so I did. Some believed me, some not. One of them acussed me of doing this to hurt him because I told him I would expose him (so this guy confirmed me that my ex was telling things). Oh, yes, I kept silence for years, even when I was attacked for not ""telling"" how was the person, and now I'm the bad person for finally telling my truth. Some even believed I was the lover of the man when he was married and were upset with me. I can understand that as I also hate lovers that break families, but I'm not that and never ever waw with him when he was married and I would have never donde that. Of course, everyone has its opinion and I was done with all the shit. Most people were supportive, but I knew that they also apreciated the man because all they knew about him was his facade of ""good man"". I distanced myself of the group and left the course with a lot of pain, but resolved to protect myself from his influence and his manipulation by third parties.

Believe me or not, this is my truth and took me a lot of inner work and therapy to heal. My fiance confesed his confusion came because he remembered being abused by a man in his family, which was truly painful for him. He acknowledged that he finds attractive men and females and that's ok, there's nothing wrong with him. He also was cleat that I was the woman he wants to spent his life with, so we came back a month later, before I came back home. Not because he wanted to hide his identity (because he opened it to the world), but because he truly was in love with me and now he fully accepted he is bisexual. Four years after, we are happier and stronger than ever and will marry the next year. The ex still tries to contact me in any way he can and get blocked and ignored every time. But any time I remember this, I felt that hidding my story from the world makes me feel unseen and fearful of people's point of view, as if I were the bad person in this story. So that's what has encouraged me to share this, with my lights and shadows.

I want to know, genuinely, if AITA in all of this. I'm prepared to be roasted if I deserve it.",0,1755776645.0,AITAH,4,0.25,False

Consider: [arewegameyet](https://arewegameyet.rs/ecosystem/engines/)

1. bevy: Inherently tied to ECS design, constant breaking changes everyone warns about?

5. ggez: Was dead for a year, but new maintainer? :) Doesn't support Android or WASM [github issue](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/BuildingForEveryPlatform.md)
6. nannou: m5 alternative? Is this even an engine? Graphics engine?
7. sdl3: Bindings.
8. raylib: Bindings.
9. sfml: Bindings.
10. blue_engine: Graphics engine?
11. tetra: Dead, unmaintained.

14. lotus_engine: Super cool! Alive, tied to ECS design.
15. oxyengine: Dead, unmaintained, ECS.

17. rusty_engine: Bevy wrapper???
18. screen-13: Vulkan... Rendering engine?
19. gemini-engine: ASCII only?
20. notan: This looks pretty cool, I think?

Coffee? Dead. Amethyst? Dead. Dead dead dead dead. Unmaintained- unsound- 3d only- ASCII only- bindings, make your own wheel- ECS is god why wouldn't you want to use it? Cross platform? More like cross a platform into a river???

I give up.

Like... I want... to make a 2d game in a cross platform, rusty, maintained, safe engine, with the ability to not use ECS. I want to not have to reinvent a wheel myself, too. I realize I want a unicorn, and I would like that unicorn to be purple (I'm a choosing beggar), but like- is game development in Rust unserious? Bevy looks shinier than gold at least, and there's a lot of hobbyist work here for these engines for no pay in their freetime- I appreciate and love that eternally. (If you've ever contributed to any of these you're super cool and better than me, it's easy to be a critic.) Are my wants just too high? I see someone in another thread say ""See! Look! So many game engines on this page!"" They are dead, unmaintained, bindings, unsafe, not cross platform, 2d vs 3d land only, or married to ECS in a shotgun wedding.

Please convince me I'm silly and dumb and fighting windmills. Maybe I should just take the ECS pill. But then everyone is saying the ground is ripped out underneath you. Maybe I should learn to stop worrying and love the Bevy- or perhaps just avoid threading in Macroquad. I don't get it. Footguns, footguns everywhere.",0,1755776532.0,rust,25,0.48,False

Does it actually avoid obstacles well? I don’t want it dumb-bumping into my speakers and furniture. Is it truly hands-off? I’m not spending $2K+ just to re-mop coffee spills or food crumbs myself.

1mw8j8p,https://i.redd.it/c8frb2wu0dkf1.jpeg,Anyone know this novel?,"A belated surprise tore apart my perfect marriage life-the man I loved for so many years cheated on me, shattered everything I clung to. 
A woman leaned into his side in a familiar gesture and his hand rested easily at her waist in the coffee shop.
Was this the gift of his apology?
I could barely breathe.
Ronin's smile broke across his face, and he laughed at whatever the little pixie woman had said. Laughed in that unguarded way I hadn't seen in... how long? 
When I could no longer contain my anger, I walked over.
Ronin's head came up slowly, as though his brain was wading through fog. 
 ""I-"" His voice stumbled. ""I was going to tell you.""
He glanced at the woman beside him. ""This is Amanda... she's...a friend.""
His jaw tighten. ""No... no, we've been seeing each other. For two years.""
I noticed the wedding ring on the woman's hand, silent statement that landed heavier than any word Ronin might have chosen.
I felt that number, the ring, land like a stone in my chest.
How was I going to take this?
————————
At forty-five, she had learned to live with the rhythm of her body's betrayals - the migraines that pulsed like drumbeats in her skull, the swelling in her belly, the dragging weight in her bones. Perimenopause had crept in slowly but insistently, taking her sleep, her patience, and sometimes even her ability to pretend everything was fine.
She and Ronin had been together for twenty years. They'd met in university when he was still with someone else, and she was part of the same tight-knit group of friends. She'd already been carrying the scars of a childhood shaped by abandonment - her father leaving when she was fourteen, caught in bed with the nineteen-year-old sister of her best friend. She had told her mother immediately, thinking honesty would be the right thing, but her mother never forgave her. Those last years before she left home had been a love-hate truce. Her father remarried the other woman, made a few awkward attempts to reconnect, and then vanished for good.
When he and Mia split up , she had been a friend at first and later his lover. She and Ronin had almost married seventeen years ago, but a week before the wedding her mother died, and grief had swallowed the ceremony whole. They postponed. Then postponed again. The second time came when she was thirty and pregnant with David. That wedding never happened either. Somewhere along the way, the urgency faded- they settled into the life they'd built - business partners once, now comfortable companions raising their boy.He had supported her decision to become a stay at home mom for their boy.
She had made herself one private vow-never to deny him makelove. No matter the exhaustion, the moods, the heaviness of her cycles-she wouldn't shut him out. Until two weeks ago, when she felt so wretched she could barely stand- pounding migraine, bloating, a stabbing ache low in her abdomen. He'd reached for her in bed, pressed himself against her for a moment, then sighed when she whispered that she was not well. He'd turned away, tossing restlessly while she lay wide-eyed in the dark until sleep finally took her close to three.
This morning had been different. The migraine had gone, replaced with a strange, restless energy. David would be home from school mid-afternoon, but Ronin had a meeting at work and then a meeting with an old school friend at this very cafe. The Snug was once loved in their university days. On impulse, she had decided to surprise him.
Now, she watched through the window as a young woman walked beside him, her hand tucked neatly into his. Her blonde curls shimmered like spun gold in the sun.She couldn't see the colour of her eyes, but her profile was stunning..She was in her early thirties at most. The woman leaned into his side in a familiar gesture and his hand rested easily at her waist.
He bent to peck the crown of her head, and she , without hesitation ,turned him toward her and pulled him down to peck him full on the mouth.
For a moment, it was like her body no longer belonged to her.
She was dimly aware of the heat flooding her face, the hard thump of her own heartbeat in her ears, the thin film of glass between them like a pane of ice. She stayed frozen, breath shallow, while the scene played out a few metres away. They didn't see her- the glare on the glass hid her.
They were about to come in when the woman glanced over her shoulder, caught sight of something she couldn't see, and tugged him in the opposite direction. They walked away.
Her hand shook as she set the cup down. One tear slipped down her cheek, hot against the cold in her skin. Her feet moved without her permission.She rose and followed them, keeping her distance. The migraine returned with a vengeance , sharp and pulsing.
She followed them like a ghost, her breath shallow, her eyes fixed on the space between their bodies where his arm brushed her waist.
Ronin's head dipped toward the woman as if drawn there ,moth to the flame. Her fingers curled around his arm, claiming the space beside him . They were in their own small world, completely absorbed in each other. They turned down a narrow lane, sunlight spilling like molten gold between the buildings. They didn't look back.
Her phone buzzed in her pocket -David, probably home by now -but she didn't check.
She caught her reflection in a shop window as they passed. Her long brown hair - she had kept it that way because Ronin liked it -hung limp, dragging her face down. It didn't frame her, it dulled her. Lifeless like the rest of her. She turned her head away quickly, as though she could erase the image by refusing to acknowledge it.
A burst of laughter from the woman pulled her attention back. The sound was high and light, with a little giggle at the end . Something about her face... familiar, though she couldn't place it. A cousin of someone? An employee she'd met at a party? No ,someone else. There was an ease there, a history she wasn't privy to.
Ronin's smile broke across his face, and he laughed at whatever the little pixie woman had said. Laughed in that unguarded way she hadn't seen in... how long? Years? She couldn't remember the last time he'd looked at her like that, as though she'd just given him a gift.
They kept walking, and she kept pace at a distance.They entered a small bistro she didn't recognise. The Rochelle,the sign said. She stood outside, watching them through the glass. Through the window, she saw them take a table, watched him lean forward, forearms on the white linen, speaking low. She saw the woman tip her head back and laugh, the movement exposing the smooth column of her neck.  Watched him lean in, watched him pick something from his own plate and place it in the woman's.
They looked young. In love.
She couldn't move. She could barely breathe.
Her hand was on the brass handle before she even realised she'd decided to move.
Inside, the air was warm and fragrant with garlic, butter, and wine. Low voices hummed under the clink of cutlery. A dark-haired maître d' in a crisp black suit approached, smiling with polished professionalism.
""Table for one, madam?""
""I'm with them,"" she said tilting her chin towards their table. Her voice came out steady,much to her surprise.
The maître d' inclined his head and, without hesitation, led her across the tiled floor toward their table.
Ronin's head came up slowly, as though his brain was wading through fog. She watched, almost absently, as irritation gave way to shock. His pupils widened, eating up the blue until only a thin rim of colour remained. His lips parted.
Fight or flight, thought Sage absently.
""Sage... what are you doing here?"" His voice was low, rough, like he'd been caught in the middle of something unplanned and didn't know which part to protect first.
The woman's smile faltered, her sloe eyes widening in surprise -but it wasn't the startled guilt she expected. It was guilt, yes, but it slowly morphed into something else. Relief. Relief that the secret was out, that she no longer had to hide.
So much for sisterhood.
Ronin's face drained of colour. He looked like someone had yanked the rug out from under him. His lips parted. ""I-"" His voice stumbled. He swallowed, tried again. ""I was going to tell you.""
He glanced at the woman beside him. ""This is Amanda... she's...a friend.""
Amanda turned her face toward Sage then, offering the faintest of polite smiles, though it didn't quite reach her beautiful eyes.
Ronin's gaze shifted back to Sage, his jaw tightening. ""No... no, we've been seeing each other. I'm sorry, Sage. Wait-wait, let me explain.""
Her eyes dropped, not to avoid him, but because something at the edge of her vision caught her. Her own hand, resting on the table. The large solitaire - heavy, elaborate, gleaming under the warm light - seemed almost absurd now. She had been so grateful when he slipped it on her finger.
When she looked up again, Amanda's hand was moving, slow and deliberate, until her pale fingers covered Ronin's darker ones in a soft, claiming press. A ruby surrounded by tiny diamonds and a simple gold wedding band caught the light on Amanda's hand -a jarring, silent statement that landed heavier than any word Ronin might have chosen.
Sage felt her stomach twist. It wasn't the contact itself that cut deepest - it was the ease of it, the way Amanda's gesture said without words: He's mine now.
Sage's gaze lingered on it for a beat too long before drifting upward. She was only half aware of Ronin speaking now. His voice rose and fell in waves, carrying a long, convoluted explanation she couldn't seem to hold onto. Words reached her in pieces - ...work together... didn't mean to... you weren't... I thought you... - fragments she couldn't, or wouldn't, assemble into sense.
There was no pain,not yet. Just a thick, airy wall, like spun sugar, between her and what she knew was waiting on the other side. The sweetness of it was false, she knew it would dissolve too quickly, and when it did, the truth beneath would be bitter and jagged.
But not now.
Not yet.
She nodded once as if waking from a nightmare. There were no accusations ,no scene. There was just the acknowledgment that now they all knew she knew. The air felt heavy between the three of them, as if the weight of the truth was pressing down into the crowded room, making it hard to breathe.
She pushed her chair back, the scrape of wood on tile louder than it should have been. Without a word, without another look at either of them, she turned and walked out into the cold.
The taxi smelled faintly of stale coffee and cigarettes. She almost never took them-too expensive. Since she'd stopped working, Ronin had been the one to put money in their joint account. She'd always been careful, using only what was necessary. She didn't buy the black dress with the red flowers. She didn't buy the hairpin she liked in the shop window last spring. She didn't spend what she hadn't earned.
Today, she didn't care.
....
David was in the kitchen when she got home, the fridge door open, his arm deep inside. ""Hey,"" she said,trying to sound normal. ""How was school? Maths challenge's next week, isn't it?""
He mumbled something, and slipped past her out of the room.
The quiet pressed in again. She sat at the table instead of prepping for tea, staring at the place mats she'd chosen years ago, wondering how they could look the same when nothing else did.
Half an hour must have passed when she heard the car pulled up. The front door opened. Ronin's footsteps sounded in the hall and  then the squelch of the seat as he sat at the kitchen island.
He started talking almost immediately. ""We work together. It... just happened.""
She didn't move or look at him, she carefully examined a hangnail on her right thumb.
""I was going to tell you.""
Silence.
""We've been...I mean...it's been two years.""
It was like her silence was inducing his verbal vomit.
She felt that number land like a stone in her chest.
There was a shuffle in the doorway.
David. His voice was small, hesitant. ""Mom...?""
Her eyes snapped to his, panic flaring so suddenly it almost choked her. How was he going to take this? How much did he know? She needed to protect him - from the worst of it, from the jagged edges she'd just seen.
""It's not anything to worry about,"" she said quickly, the words tumbling out before she could stop them. ""It's... it's nothing, David.""
He shook his head slowly. ""I know, Ma... I know.""
She froze.
""I saw them together."" He glanced down, then met her gaze head-on, and it was like looking into the eyes of a stranger.
Her lips parted, but no words came.
""Two months ago,"" he added, answering the question she hadn't yet asked.
She stood there, barely breathing, the air thick and unmoving around her.
""She's nice,"" he said finally. ""If Dad's happy with her..."" He trailed off with a shrug, as though it were that simple.
The sound of her own pulse roared in her ears. Nice. If Dad's happy. The words landed like stones, one after another, until she couldn't tell if she was more stunned by the betrayal  or by how easily her son could accept it.",2,1755776461.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Ever felt like you're throwing your hard-earned cash into the digital void? 😩 I mean, we’re all trying to level up, but it’s super easy to get lost in the whirlwind of shiny new AI tools popping up every day. So, let’s chat about how to *stop wasting money* and work smarter instead! 💡 

**Why AI Tools?**  
Before we dive into the goods, let’s take a second to appreciate what AI tools can do. They’re like those multi-tools you keep in your drawer—super handy if you know how to use them! From content generation to social media scheduling, these tools can *seriously* lighten your workload.

**The Beginner’s Checklist:**

1. **Identify Your Needs**  
   - What’s your biggest struggle? Writing? Editing? Social media?  
   - Focus on tools that address *your* pain points. No sense in buying a Swiss Army knife if you only need a can opener!

2. **Do Your Research**  
   - Check out reviews! Got a tool in mind? Look it up on forums and see if others have found it useful.  
   - Transparency is key; don’t fall for the shiny website if the functionality is just…meh. 

3. **Trial Versions Are Your BFF**  
   - Most tools offer a free trial. Test the waters before committing to that yearly subscription that makes your wallet scream.  
   - Think about it: Would you buy a pair of shoes without trying them on? Exactly. 

4. **Look for Alternatives**  
   - Sometimes, the budget-friendly options can do just as good a job! Open-source tools are popping up everywhere, so grab a list and give some a whirl.  
   - Have you heard of any hidden gems? Floor us with your finds!

5. **Stay Current, Stay Smart**  
   - The AI landscape is changing faster than I can finish my morning coffee! ☕️ Keep your ear to the ground. Follow trends and see what’s working for other creators like you. 

6. **Budget Wisely**  
   - Set up a budget for tools. Stick to it like you would a diet—except when it’s a donut day! 😜  
   - Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Spend where you see growth potential, but don’t go overboard. 

7. **Connect with the Community**  
   - Look for forums, Reddit threads (ahem), or social media groups where creators share tips and tricks. 💬  
   - There’s no need to reinvent the wheel; others have been down this road!

I know it can feel overwhelming—*so many options, so little time.* But hey, if we focus on what we really need and leverage these tools wisely, we’ll be on our way to running effective businesses without breaking the bank! 

So, what’s your experience with AI tools? Have you found any winners, or do you have a horror story about an overpriced tool? Let’s share the knowledge and keep each other from unwanted expenses! 🚀",1,1755776456.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Many of the issues we see—cavities, gum irritation, bad breath—can often be prevented with just a few consistent practices.



Here are 5 simple but powerful tips we share with our patients every day:



1. Brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste – Brushing removes plaque, and fluoride strengthens enamel to fight cavities. Nighttime brushing is especially important because saliva flow slows down while you sleep.



2. Floss daily (yes, it really matters!) – Brushing alone only cleans about 60% of your tooth surfaces. Flossing gets into those tight spaces where bacteria like to hide, preventing gum disease and decay between teeth.



3. Limit frequent snacking and sugary drinks – Sipping soda, coffee with sugar, or energy drinks throughout the day constantly exposes your teeth to acid, which erodes enamel. If you enjoy these drinks, try to finish them in one sitting and rinse with water afterward.



4. Replace your toothbrush every 3 months – Worn-out bristles don’t clean effectively and can harbor bacteria. A fresh brush (or electric toothbrush head) keeps your cleaning routine more effective.



5. See your [dentist](https://shareasmiledental.com/about/) every 6 months for a checkup – Even with perfect home care, some buildup and early problems can only be spotted by a professional. Regular visits mean small issues get treated before they turn into painful or costly problems.

I realized it was unsustainable to restrict myself so much with food and I didn’t enjoy it at all. Plus, honestly, I believe that meat provides tremendous nutritional value for the body.
I think the best approach is to take from each type of diet whatever is healthiest for you and whatever can be best sustained in the long term.
But, for example, I switched from cutting my coffee with cow’s milk to just a splash of almond milk and I’ve stuck with it because I really think it’s an excellent combination. I love really bitter drinks, and nowadays if I have coffee with cow’s milk it tastes overly sweet to me.
Another habit I picked up (but this was more because I used to eat very poorly) is adding lots of vegetables to my meals and learning the best ways to cook them so that I actually enjoy them. I used to dislike vegetables because I thought they had no flavor, but then I started discovering so many ways to enjoy the ones that became my favorites.
Anyway, I’m curious if there’s something (food-related or not) from this diet/lifestyle that you’ve found to be a good long-term discovery.",0,1755776258.0,exvegans,1,0.5,False
1mw8gg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1mw8gg7/i_cant_wrap_my_head_around_it_years_later/,i can't wrap my head around it years later,"i can't add multiple tags, but TW i was a minor at the time. i also apologize in advance if this is hard to follow, i just need it all out there.

this is going to be long but i want to give all the details, i have no one i can go to that's unbiased or i trust. i want the full picture out there for proper... help? judgement? i don't even know.

where do i even begin

to sum part of it up, my childhood was.. not great. my dad passed when i was 12, my parents (mom and step-dad) were alcoholics, more so him than her, and there was a lot of physical abuse, blah blah. my relationship with my mom was difficult, i know she always tried her best and i understand how hard it has been for her. we're on great terms now, but this is important context. during this time was the biggest strain between me and her; i was getting overwhelmed and tired with her hurtful words, manipulation, my lack of freedom. 

during this separation between us, we lost my sibling. this took a massive toll on everyone, and my mom started drinking again. heavily. she would disappear into the town and i was the only one who would go find her. every single day i was afraid i would find her dead. i was struggling with losing them, fearing the possible loss of my mom, trying to handle keeping myself together to help my other siblings, trying to find the will to keep going, etc etc.

moving on to my coworker (37M) and i (16-17F at the time. i know.)
my coworker, whom i hadn't really spoken to before, heard the news (small town), and stepped up to help me. it started with an invite to a car derby with his friend. then it was group hangouts at the coffee shop. then group hangouts at his house. my mom didn't like me going over there (for good reason), so i started sneaking out to hang out with them. i started smoking weed with them, and drinking beer. i spent about 3 months where i was not mentally here. he told me it would help, and it definitely did. got me hooked onto adderall, said it helped him and would definitely help me. after about a month, it was just me and him.

around then, he decided he wanted more from me.. i can't remember how exactly it went down, he was handing me drink after drink, so it's fuzzy. i think he asked, i distinctly remember him saying ""you'll like it"" and pulling my shorts off. i try not to remember the rest.

the part i still don't understand, and hate myself every single moment for; i went back over to his house. for about 3 weeks, i kept going over there. i'd try to make sure his other friend was there, or excuse myself to leave early, but the nights i couldn't, he'd do it again. i don't remember fighting him, i think i was too scared or intoxicated each time maybe. 

i do know that after the first time, i convinced myself that no one would want me after that. not my mom, my family, my then ex-boyfriend whom i was still attached to. it was my ""first time"", so why would any other guy want me?

i think i started to convince myself that not only did he do all of it out of love, but that i loved him back. when things finally stopped, i told him what he did was not okay. the last thing he said to me was ""I was in love with you, how could you just throw this away?""

i think i got attached to the feeling of someone wanting me, even if i hated those moments alone. that, and being able to escape everything mentally by smoking or drinking until i couldn't think. 

i just... i don't know if it's really rape. i denied but i gave in each time. i also willingly went back over to his house, knowing it was a possibility. i feel angry, guilty, confused. i hate myself, and i blame myself. i just want to know if maybe i should accept that while regrettable, it's a choice i willingly made? or that i should realize i was a victim, and i need to stop blaming myself for it? i know the age gap alone makes it bad, but i don't know if i can really blame him. i felt guilty for ""hurting"" him and i still can't fully let myself be angry with him, even if he damaged me so much",2,1755776235.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

1mw8f0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerReviews/comments/1mw8f0d/delve_into_dumos_barstools_set_of_4_and_is_it/,Delve Into DUMOS Barstools Set of 4 and Is It Worth the Hype,"The DUMOS SW1-8100BK-4P bar stools entered my home as a stylish upgrade for our kitchen counter area. With a contemporary design that melds seamlessly into various decor styles, these stools promised both elegance and functionality. They weren’t just another set of counter-height seating options—they were a test in practicality, aesthetics, and everyday usability.

**Sleek Modern Design with Versatile Appeal**  
Immediately upon unboxing the stools, I was struck by their modern look. That straight-legged black metal base, paired with the PU leather saddle seat, has a sleek and understated vibe. The dark black color effortlessly matched my kitchen’s minimalist theme. These stools feel right at home in almost any setting, from an urban loft to a suburban kitchen. Whether I hosted dinner parties or just had coffee at the counter, they fit into the ambiance like they were born to be there.

**Comfort Without Compromise**  
For a bar stool, comfort is a challenge, but this set seems to have cracked the code. The thickened cushions, which mimic the feel of a sofa, genuinely surprised me with their softness. The ergonomic curve of the backrest provided much-needed lumbar support, particularly during those long conversations over wine with friends. Even my family noticed how comfortable the seating was, and my younger cousin was especially thrilled with the footrest—perfect for her shorter legs. Comfort that’s well-suited for people of different ages and heights is a huge win.

**Strengths**  
- Eye-catching modern design that complements diverse home decor.  
- Soft, cushioned seating with ergonomic lumbar support.  
- Sturdy metal construction means no wobbling or creaking.  

[Check DUMOS SW1-8100BK-4P price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b0dlnz5slg/)

**Adjustability and Easy Assembly**  
Features like the height adjustability made these stools practical for our varying counter heights. The 360° swivel provided a fun, functional twist for users of all ages. My nephew found great joy spinning around on them during family gatherings. The assembly process, often a daunting task with furniture, was surprisingly straightforward. Every necessary tool arrived in the package, accompanied by clear instructions. Even the installation videos were incredibly helpful. I managed to assemble all four stools in under an hour without breaking a sweat.

**Limitations**  
- Assembly, while straightforward, still requires some patience for first-timers.  
- The PU leather, although stylish, may not be as durable as genuine leather over time.  

**Everyday Functionality and Durability**  
After daily use for weeks, the stools remained solid and reliable. The weight capacity, claimed up to 330 pounds, held up under the pressure—literally. My partner, who’s a bit on the heavier side, sat and tested its durability multiple times without issue. I also appreciated how easy the stools were to clean. A simple wipe with a damp cloth cleared crumbs and minor spills, making it family-friendly and low-maintenance. 

**Competing Products**  
When comparing these stools to more premium options like adjustable-height stools from brands such as Zuri or Rivet, a few differences stood out. The DUMOS model wins in terms of affordability and versatility in its style. However, competitors offering genuine leather or higher-end finishing materials may last longer in the durability department. Alternatively, basic models found in lower price ranges lacked crucial features such as the ergonomic back support and padded seating offered by the DUMOS set. Budget-conscious buyers will find this set an awesome middle ground.

**Quality for Price**  
Considering the balance between its appealing modern design, reliable build, and user-friendly adjustability features, this set is definitely worth the investment. Cheaper options often compromise either aesthetics or comfort, while premium stools with similar features can easily cost twice as much. For the price category, these stools hit that sweet spot of affordability and performance, proving to be a smart purchase for most households.

The idea of smoother connections across all my devices felt like a game-changer. Over the past two months, I’ve put this dual-band router through its paces, handling everything from setting up smart home systems to a few late-night gaming sessions. Here's what stood out to me, both good and bad, during my hands-on experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Visually, the sheer simplicity of this device fits naturally into any space. The black finish is minimal and clean, allowing it to blend unobtrusively into my setup—a real plus when you’re juggling gadgets left and right. Measuring at 9.06 x 5.28 x 2.2 inches, it doesn’t crowd my desk or look like an eyesore on a shelf. However, there’s substance beyond the looks. With four external antennas paired with MU-MIMO and OFDMA technology, this machine is all about delivering efficiency. Every hardware detail screams, ""I’m made for multitasking."" However, the antennas felt rigid, and I was frankly a bit uneasy applying extra pressure to adjust them for maximum coverage. That’s one small nitpick in an otherwise solid design.  

**Setup Experience**  
The initial setup of this ASUS dual-band router was straightforward—thankfully. After opening the box, all I needed was to connect it via the provided app, and voilà, the thing was breathing life into my home network. It works beautifully with Apple iOS, Linux, Mac OS, and Windows systems, which means there wasn’t a moment where compatibility became an issue. During the setup, parental controls immediately caught my eye, making it super easy to manage my kids' internet usage. Surprisingly, activating the one-click VPN through Instant Guard felt almost too simple. But here's the deal: for someone casually stepping into advanced router territory, I could see the abundance of settings being slightly overwhelming.

**Strengths**  
• WiFi 6 speed, ensuring stable and fast connections for gaming and streaming  
• Integrated network security powered by Trend Micro for peace of mind  
• AiMesh compatibility allows you to extend your network seamlessly  
• Compact design fits cleanly into various spaces  

[Time to see ASUS RT-AX1800S cost on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b09m9477ns/)

**Performance for Heavy Users**  
Day-to-day, this router shined whether I was zipping through work emails or bingeing the latest Netflix releases. My internet plan isn’t top-end, but this router fully squeezed every ounce of speed out of my connection. The performance was consistently stable, even with around 12 connected devices, among them smart speakers, streaming sticks, laptops, and smartphones. It supports a dual-core processor, which effectively handled simultaneous operations without breaking a sweat. Not once did I experience those dreaded game-lag moments, even during intense multiplayer matches. That said, I tested the coverage in my backyard, and though the reach was decent, it didn’t go far beyond the walls of my home. If you're imagining sipping coffee on the patio while fully connected, you might need to think twice.

**Negatives**  
• Limited range compared to some similarly-priced competitors  
• Antennas are not particularly flexible  
• Overwhelming for someone unfamiliar with advanced networking settings  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this router to others like the TP-Link Archer AX21, choosing between them depends on what you truly need. The TP-Link has better range, especially across multiple floors, while the ASUS RT-AX1800S edges it out in multi-device environments. With built-in VPN and AiMesh features, ASUS leans into smart home connectivity, which is something the TP-Link doesn’t quite prioritize. At a glance, the NETGEAR Nighthawk AX4 also presents strong competition, and I’ve noticed they offer a similar feature set. However, the ASUS router feels far more refined with its interface, thanks to an app that isn’t riddled with occasional bugs.

**Value for Money**  
Taking cost-efficiency into consideration, this device packs a substantial set of features for the price—more than enough to justify the investment. From the security features by Trend Micro to the built-in VPN functionality, you’re looking at a router that does more than the basics. Some may find cheaper alternatives tempting, but for anyone gaming, streaming, or venturing into advanced setup modes like mesh networking, this router punches well above its weight. If long-range coverage isn’t a must, this choice feels like “bang for the buck.”

What good is a tank if you can’t get the metals to build it?

This week’s meeting between U.S., Ukrainian, and European leaders showed potential progress towards security cooperation. And while the new U.S.-Ukrainian Reconstruction Investment Fund [agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-agreement-to-establish-united-states-ukraine-reconstruction-investment-fund/) marks an important step toward increasing the [resilience](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/07/the-future-of-critical-raw-materials-how-ukraine-plays-a-strategic-role-in-global-supply-chains/) of both U.S. and European supply chains, there is more work to be done. Building on this momentum, the United States and the European Union should seek closer critical minerals supply chain cooperation.

There are several opportunities for the two economies to work together by focusing on defense and security — rather than the economic and clean energy framing of the past. Tighter cooperation could strengthen the E.U. defense-industrial base, enhance military readiness, and strengthen NATO’s deterrence posture while enabling the United States to secure critical minerals, preserve manufacturing capacity, and redirect [precious resources](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/how-united-states-can-effectively-pivot-asia) to the Indo-Pacific. Supply chain cooperation would also help both sides reduce dependence on China, which dominates the critical minerals market by creating [oversupply](https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/a-federal-critical-mineral-processing-initiative-securing-u-s-mineral-independence-from-china/) and using [export restrictions](https://jamestown.org/program/trade-talks-real-moves-prc-locks-down-critical-minerals-behind-the-scenes/). Indeed, the China challenge requires the United States and Europe to work together.

The cooperation mechanisms we highlight — trade [guardrails](https://www.kas.de/en/single-title/-/content/eu-japan-critical-raw-materials-alliance), bolstering industrial base efforts, and leveraging lessons learned — are [novel](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA4000-1.html) and could be included within existing frameworks, a broader U.S.-E.U. minerals deal, or as individual agreements.

**Europe Sharpens Its Defense-Industrial Priorities**

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has helped to catalyze Europe’s shift from mere discussions about defense capacity-building to concrete action beyond NATO’s new spending [pledge](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm). Defense and security are central issues for the 2024–2029 political cycle in Europe. The European Union has prioritized boosting defense production in key policy documents and regulatory proposals, including the 2023 [European Defence Industry Reinforcement Through Common Procurement Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2418/oj/eng). The act’s €300 million ($350 million) seed funding [has already unlocked](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-boosts-defence-readiness-first-ever-financial-support-common-defence-procurement-2024-11-14_en) over €11 billion ($12.8 billion) in joint procurement. This funding is rapidly replenishing ammunition and modernizing key platforms such as armored vehicles and tanks.

Meanwhile, the [European Defence Fund](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf-official-webpage-european-commission_en) supports research projects with participants from multiple countries and strengthens interoperability. The proposed [European Defence Industry Programme](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52024PC0150) promises a further €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion) to shore up industrial resilience and secure a [steady supply](https://eda.europa.eu/what-we-do/all-activities/activities-search/security-of-supply) of goods and services so E.U. members can meet their defense-related commitments. The recent activation of the [Stability and Growth Pact’s escape clause](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/07/08/council-activates-flexibility-in-eu-fiscal-rules-for-15-member-states-to-increase-defence-spending/) by at least 15 members provides flexibility to dedicate up to 1.5 percent more of their GDP to defense investments over the next four years.

Further still, the 2024 [Draghi report](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en) on European competitiveness and the [Niinistö report](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/defence/safer-together-path-towards-fully-prepared-union_en) on strengthening Europe’s Civilian and Military Preparedness and Readiness laid the groundwork for future action to support the European defense industrial base.

In March 2025, the European Union set out a strategic vision for strengthening its defense capabilities in its [White Paper for European Defence – Readiness 2030](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/defence/future-european-defence_en) and the [ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/defence/future-european-defence_en) financing scheme\*\*.\*\* The latter dedicates €800 billion ($933 billion) in defense spending by allowing E.U. countries to increase their budgets, launches a €150 billion ($175 billion) [loan instrument](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/27/safe-council-adopts-150-billion-boost-for-joint-procurement-on-european-security-and-defence/), and expands European Investment Bank lending for defense projects.

To achieve this vision, the European Union must secure the critical minerals — like cobalt, rare earth elements, and gallium — needed for military applications and dual-use technologies. This includes lithium-ion batteries, for which demand will only increase “exponentially” in the future, as noted in the 2024 European [Critical Raw Minerals Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401252).

This first European Union-wide regulation dealing with critical minerals aims to reduce the bloc’s dependence on foreign sources with outsized market power (i.e., China), build resilience, and secure the materials needed for clean energy, digital, and defense technologies. Beyond a strong push to use more European resources through mining, [refining, and recycling](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/04/europes-pursuit-securing-critical-raw-materials-green-transition-0), there is an effort to diversify imports through bilateral ([14 in place so far](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1807)) and multilateral mechanisms like the International Energy Agency, the G7, and the [Minerals Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership).

**Shared Goals but Slow Progress**

European defense capacity-building is a [shared goal](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2025/04/26/the-eus-overdue-defense-buildup-how-rearm-europe-can-succeed/) of the United States and the European Union, and securing important supply chains and maintaining access to critical resources, including critical minerals, should be central to this effort. Cooperation on critical minerals should reflect the reality that the U.S. and European supply chains are already tightly integrated across many parts of the trans-Atlantic defense-industrial base. The 2022 [Minerals Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership) laid the groundwork for cooperation through matching mining projects with capital. And the European Union tried to advance bilateral cooperation in 2023 and 2024 by negotiating a [Critical Mineral Agreement](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3214) with the United States. While these efforts focused primarily on critical minerals for energy and digital technologies that address climate change and promote economic growth, critical minerals for defense and aerospace applications have now become as important. Addressing this demand requires rethinking how this cooperation can be shaped, especially in light of [restructured](https://electrificationcoalition.org/resource/ev-and-charging-tax-credits-after-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act/) Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives.

Progress is complicated by the unpredictability and inconsistency of current U.S. trade policy. Despite [ongoing communication](https://www.ft.com/content/aac26993-8be0-499f-bc08-9a59ed7f4aed) and [regular engagement](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-discussing-steel-chip-plane-cooperation-with-us-trade-chief-says-2025-05-28/), the structure and scope of potential U.S.-E.U. cooperation remain unclear. The [future](https://www.pism.pl/publications/trade-and-technology-councils-future-in-question-under-trump) of international cooperation mechanisms like the Mineral Security Partnership and [Trade and Technology Council](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/stronger-europe-world/eu-us-trade-and-technology-council_en) also remain in doubt pending the Senate confirmation of senior administration officials and the Section 232 [investigation](https://www.cfr.org/article/guide-trumps-section-232-tariffs-nine-maps) into critical minerals. Whether through the Minerals Security Partnership, trade talks, or mineral agreements, shifting towards a defense and security cooperation framework could be the answer to slow progress.

**New Opportunities for Defense-Industrial Base and Supply Chain Cooperation**

While U.S. trade policy poses challenges to U.S.-E.U. relations across various sectors, including critical minerals, it can also create opportunities for collaboration. Current U.S. policy could potentially serve as a springboard for strategic mineral talks including joint initiatives and minerals agreements centered on defense and security. One priority area could include developing coordinated guardrails to protect U.S. and European firms up and down the mineral-technology value chain. This would help address China’s [unfair market practices](https://jamestown.org/program/trade-talks-real-moves-prc-locks-down-critical-minerals-behind-the-scenes/). This system of guard rails could include a sectoral trade agreement on a select commodity group, mineral-swap agreements to sell stockpiled commodities to one another in the future, and supply chain intelligence sharing. Joint stockpiling of critical minerals could build off existing [Nordic initiatives](https://www.huoltovarmuuskeskus.fi/en/organisation/the-national-emergency-supply-agency), which could secure minerals from European mines for U.S. stocks and could further support European efforts to boost domestic extraction and processing capabilities.

The United States can bolster current E.U. efforts. For example, the bloc has already begun implementing the Critical Raw Mineral Act. In March 2025, the European Commission selected [47 strategic domestic projects](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_864), including initiatives focused on magnesium and tungsten. In June, it selected another [13 strategic projects](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_25_1419/IP_25_1419_EN.pdf) outside the European Union, including in Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Brussels and Washington can work together to reduce risk of these projects and the United States has expressed a willingness to do so: At the July 2025 Ukraine Recovery Conference, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation [announced](https://www.urc-international.com/urc25/programme-urc-2025) it would welcome co-investment by the European Investment Bank in the new U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund.

The United States and the European Union can also learn from each other to develop new capabilities to secure supply chains. The European Union recently launched an [Energy and Raw Materials Platform](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-security/eu-energy-and-raw-materials-platform_en) to pool demand for energy and minerals that includes a matchmaking mechanism between suppliers and consumers. The platform’s hydrogen matchmaking mechanism is already running and its raw materials one will soon follow. By the end of 2026, in line with the Draghi report, the European Union will set up a [Critical Raw Material Centre](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/clean-industrial-deal_en) to jointly purchase raw materials for interested companies and in cooperation with individual member states. Other areas of potential U.S.-E.U. cooperation might include coordinating strategic stockpiles, supply chain monitoring, and designing financial products to invest in upstream supply. If done with sufficient ambition and financial power, the Critical Raw Material Centre could resemble the European equivalent of the Japan Organization for Metal and Energy Security, which has effectively managed Japan’s mineral supply chain risks. The European Union’s efforts to adapt institutions to the industrial challenges posed by China’s exports can serve as lessons learned and leveraged by the United States to address its techno-economic competition with China.

# Conclusion

***Focusing on strategic and security implications by prioritizing U.S.-E.U. cooperation on defense-related critical minerals could provide impetus for both sides to retool the Minerals Security Partnership, resolve trade differences, or*** [***broker minerals agreements***](https://www.eeuropa.org/trade-war-20-the-battle-for-critical-minerals-7678.html)***. Doing so could allow the two economies to erect trade guardrails to protect their nascent mineral-technology industries, bolster current efforts already underway, and streamline policy implementation by leveraging lessons learned.

# AUGUST 21st, 2025~Australia’s ‘critical’ offering to the US

[Australia’s ‘critical’ offering to the US](https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/australia-s-critical-offering-to-the-us/ar-AA1KTW7P?ocid=BingNewsSerp)  
***Australia is key to Donald Trump’s goals of weaning the US off cheap Chinese critical minerals, Australia’s envoy in Washington says.***

***Critical minerals are just that – minerals, such as lithium, vital for manufacturing advanced technologies, from smartphones and cars to wind turbines and defence systems.***

[Australia’s ‘critical’ offering to the US](https://preview.redd.it/ily01p42hckf1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=e930f5b94722ee6815a798e8802c78ec76ed4ecf)

Currently, China dominates the space, but Australia has emerged as a challenger, ruffling some feathers in Beijing.

Because of their importance to modern tech, Western countries are increasingly viewing critical minerals as a matter of national security and scrambling to bolster sovereign stockpiles and production.

In an interview overnight, Australian Ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd said that Xi Jinping’s “ideology” on China’s long-term economic development was “to ensure that the world is dependent on China while China is not dependent on the world”.

“And that in a nutshell is what we see across the whole breadth of industrial policy, from semiconductors through to critical minerals and rare earths,” the former prime minister told the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Boasting mineral reserves that “more or less equals the periodic table” and an advanced mining sector, Mr Rudd said Australia was well-placed to help break the dependence on China.

“Geology has been kind to us,” he said, adding that Australia is “an ancient continent”.

“We have the best mining companies in the world and the biggest mining companies in the world, some of whom have just been meeting with President Trump here in Washington, DC., as well as a whole depth of technical expertise represented in the research faculties of our major universities.

“So put together the geology … put together our processing capacity … and put together the depth and breadth of our mining expertise, I think we’re well-placed to assist in diversifying the supply chains, creating resilient supply chains, and helping the United States, under President Trump’s leadership, meet his requirements for a resilient America when it comes to critical minerals and rare earths.”

Australia’s emergence as a competitor in the sector has not gone down well in Beijing.

Despite the Chinese President’s warm words to Anthony Albanese in July about fair and open trade, his government’s actions have made clear that extends to Australian lobsters rather than Australian minerals.

Since 2022, Australia’s leading producer Lynas Rare Earths has been subjected to a relentless Chinese disinformation campaign targeting its operations both within Australia and abroad.

It has not deterred efforts to grow Australia’s presence, driven in large part by the defence industry.

***Mr Rudd said critical minerals should be viewed as “defence goods”, pointing to the tons used in the nuclear-powered submarines Australia is set to get under AUKUS.***

***He said the American-made Virginia-class “contains within it something like 4.5 tons of critical minerals, rare earths, highly processed”.***

***“You go to an F-35, you’re looking at a high proportion of the actual aircraft itself being derivative of advanced process to rare earth,” he continued.***

https://preview.redd.it/fif9fma4ickf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb99d50d354bb22b15469adcfc93caaac001732a

***“So whether we like it or not, the reality is the sharpest edges of what we do in the military hang off the availability of critical minerals in rare earths supply, as well as processed critical minerals in rare earths, as well as critical ... derivatives, such as magnets.***

“So I think what President Trump is seeking to do … is trying to find how this now plays into a secure supply chain the United States.

“And as a US ally, we are ready and able to help, and we have the capacity to do so.”

Last week, tensions escalated when Mr. Trump accused Brazil of being a “horrible trading partner.” Mr. Lula shot back, pointing out that his nation runs a trade deficit with the United States. “We’re still willing to negotiate, but Brazil won’t kneel before the United States.”

Brazil now appears to be forging ahead largely without the United States. It is studying its deposits with the help of a Spanish mapping firm and working toward [improving its processing abilities](https://www.senai.portaldaindustria.com.br/imas-terras-raras) through a public-private partnership backed by more than two dozen companies and research groups from around the world.

\*“\*Establishing a supply chain outside of China is quite important for most Western nations right now,” said John Prineas, executive chairman of Australia-based St. George Mining, which is developing a rare earths project in Brazil’s Araxá region. “Brazil has a potentially big role to play there.

The tariffs on Brazil [were softened by hundreds of exceptions](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/world/americas/trump-brazil-tariffs-lula.html), but rare earths were notably absent from the list.

That would make American firms reluctant to invest in the country’s rare earths, according to Sergio Fontanez, a former government adviser and chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a government export credit agency.

“There’s an opportunity there for us,” Mr. Fontanez said. “But what you’re essentially creating now,” he added, “is an embargo for U.S. companies.”

# AUGUST 18th, 2025~Sanctions, Tariffs, and the Global Titanium Supply: Catalysts for Crisis

[Sanctions, Tariffs, and the Global Titanium Supply: Catalysts for Crisis - The Oregon Group - Critical Minerals and Energy Intelligence](https://theoregongroup.com/commodities/titanium/sanctions-tariffs-and-the-global-titanium-supply-catalysts-for-crisis/)

The global trade war, driven by tariffs and export controls, poses a significant threat to Western titanium supply chains, intensifying volatility in a market vital for aerospace, defence, clean energy, and everyday products like paint and sunscreen.

The trade war is acting as a catalyst on long-term drivers, from tightening supply to rising demand — and China’s dominance across the titanium value chain, where it controls:

* 34%, the [highest global producer](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC137082), of primary titanium minerals, ilmenite and rutile
* and [67% of global titanium sponge production](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC137082)

# But in the volatility there is also opportunity for junior miners.

https://preview.redd.it/wurljhqtlckf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=ede93dd55a113f878650b46652eb68e3dab1a759

**Why titanium matters — and why it’s suddenly geopolitical**

Governments across the West, including Australia, the EU, and the USA, recognize titanium as a critical mineral due to its importance in two distinct markets:

* **pigment-grade titanium dioxide (TiO₂)**: the world’s premium opacifier, more than 90% of global TiO₂ accounts for the manufacture of pigments for coatings, plastics, and paper
* **metal-grade titanium**: due to its uniquely high strength-to-weight ratio and high corrosion resistance, titanium metal is essential in aerospace, military applications, medical implants, and high-performance industrial systems

In Q1 2025, [according](https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/media/files/mis-2025q1-titan.pdf) to the US Geological Survey, the US was heavily dependent on imports of titanium mineral concentrates and titanium sponge. For example, the US imported 245,000 metric tons of titanium mineral concentrates (including ilmenite, rutile, and synthetic rutile), while domestic production data was withheld due to confidentiality concerns and limited industry reporting; and the US imported 10,500 metric tons of titanium sponge, with domestic production, consumption, shipments, and stocks of sponge withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. This means that nearly all of the titanium mineral concentrates used in the US are sourced from other countries.

There is only one titanium sponge producer in the US, a facility in Utah with an [estimated](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-titanium.pdf) production capacity of 500 tons per year, although actual production data is withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data.

The [Titanium Sponge Working Group (TSWG)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/04/2023-16624/notice-of-report-publication-from-the-titanium-sponge-working-group), established under the Trump administration in 2020, found US dependency on imported titanium sponge had risen dramatically from 68% in 2020 to 100% in 2023.

Since then, the US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated funding to develop a fully-integrated domestic mineral-to-metal titanium supply chain, including efforts to restart domestic sponge production, including:

* **IperionX:** [received](https://www.defenseandmunitions.com/news/iperion-x-awarded-47-million-dollars-by-dod-to-secure-us-titanium-supply-chains/) a $47.1 million to develop a fully-integrated U.S. mineral-to-metal titanium supply chain

**China’s titanium dominance**

China dominates large swathes of the global titanium value-chain, including:

* **34% of the world’s primary titanium minerals (ilmenite and rutile) production** [originates](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/turbulence-in-global-titanium-supply/) from China, dwarfing Mozambique (17.5%) and South Africa
* China [produces](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/visualizing-asias-dominance-in-the-titanium-supply-chain/) **67% of global titanium sponge supply**, having tripled its capacity since 2018
* China’s **TiO₂ production** capacity [reportedly](https://www.bloominglobal.com/media/detail/chinas-titanium-dioxide-industry-faces-challenges-in-2025-with-production-capacity-approaching-7-million-tons) reached 6.05 million tons by the end of 2024, with an additional 1.3 million tons planned for 2025, representing over **55% of global capacity**

The core problem for the West is not resource availability, but **processing capacity**. The real chokepoint is **metal-grade production**, especially **aerospace-certified sponge and titanium alloys**. These require highly controlled refining and long-term qualification processes, which only a handful of facilities outside China and Russia currently meet.

This dominance gives Beijing considerable leverage as geopolitical tensions rise, and the risk of China weaponizing this position — through export curbs, licensing restrictions, or retaliatory tariffs — is already being tested in other critical mineral supply chains, as well as a possible US response.

**Rare earths, gallium and copper warnings — could titanium be next**

Much like rare earths, plenty of titanium-bearing minerals exist outside China — from [Australia](https://theoregongroup.com/commodities/titanium/securing-western-titanium-supply-australias-strategic-opportunity/) to Mozambique and Canada. But producing aerospace-grade titanium metal from these minerals is where the bottleneck lies. The certification process for defense and aviation applications is [complex, expensive, and time-consuming](https://mmta.co.uk/titanium-market-weighs-certification-of-chinese-sponge/). Once certified, maintaining that qualification adds another barrier to scaling production.

**China**

Since 2023, Beijing has implemented [export controls](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-news/china-announces-rare-earth-export-restrictions/) on at least 16 different minerals and related products, including gallium, germanium, graphite, tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium.

**USA**

In an attempt to secure its own supply chain, the US has announced a series of tariffs and investigations into critical mineral supply chains, including:

* Trump signed an executive order [launching](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-signs-order-launching-probe-into-reliance-imported-critical-minerals-2025-04-15/) an investigation into “all US critical minerals imports” — including [titanium](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/president-trump-orders-section-232-investigation-critical-minerals-and-derivative) — that are found to threaten to impair national security
* a 50% tariff on **copper** [set to take effect August 1, 2025](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/), under Section 232 authority, targeting copper imports to boost US production for EVs, military, grid & consumer goods
* as well as tariffs across major commodities such as [steel and aluminum](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3j7z73yv2o)

The U.S. is beginning to address the downstream bottleneck. The Department of Defense is now funding projects to **restart domestic sponge production** and reduce dependency:

* **IperionX** was [awarded](https://www.mpif.org/News/FocusPM/TabId/979/ArtMID/3883/ArticleID/1061/IperionX-Secures-471-Million-DoD-Contract-to-Strengthen-US-Titanium-Supply-Chain.aspx) **$47.1 million** to develop a fully integrated mineral-to-metal titanium supply chain and [secured](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iperionx-secures-first-u-army-123000028.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADQIqjVBdqc1M9oHZ6qa6ie7j6LX0NuKWLOhjxoMCslBULt66mAM7TsjrAPXV71t48VJOMW23GDfHLk_8bf-j1K27EcEz0L-s-vzYsHrk73gjmeeFxE9y38RSnSLHgnglU_qPV_Iy1GvQbWm7tmfeRJEu4wYzyLfJ3m8siLXD_46) their first US Army Task Order under US$99 million SBIR Phase III contract

* **Norsk Titanium** [qualified](https://www.norsktitanium.com/media/press/norsk-titanium-qualifies-component-for-us-department-of-defense-application) a titanium aerospace component for a U.S. DoD program using additive manufacturing in 2024

But none of these investments in the US offer a quick fix.

Instead, the tit-for-tat of export/import controls provides a clear roadmap for other potential — and sudden — critical minerals, for example, titanium, restrictions.

And countries like Russia are also paying attention with reports that in late 2024 Putin [considered](https://projectblue.com/blue/opinion-pieces/1018/russia-considering-export-restrictions-on-raw-materials-including-ti-and-ni) export restrictions on titanium sponge.

**Geopolitical Sanctions and Supply Rerouting**

Beyond tariffs, geopolitical events, particularly the war in Ukraine, have already significantly impacted titanium supply chains:

**Surging Demand and Tightening Global Supply**

Several secular trends are colliding to turbocharge demand for titanium:

* **aerospace:** global passenger traffic is [forecast](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/turbulence-in-global-titanium-supply/) to exceed **10 billion in 2025**, driving new aircraft orders and downstream titanium demand
* **defense:** Global defense spending hit **US$2.46 trillion in 2024**, with further increases [expected](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/turbulence-in-global-titanium-supply/) as countries rearm in response to geopolitical instability
* **clean tech:** innovations like next-generation photovoltaic solar panels and lightweight EV parts are rapidly [expanding](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/turbulence-in-global-titanium-supply/) titanium’s applications
* **medical, automotive, consumer:** Titanium’s corrosion resistance and strength-to-weight ratio make it [increasingly popular](https://www.marketresearch.com/DataM-Intelligence-4Market-Research-LLP-v4207/Global-Titanium-40840131/) for medical implants, automotive parts, and high-end consumer goods

From everyday pigments to jet engines, the titanium dioxide (TiO₂) market was valued at [US$24 billion in 2024](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/titanium-market-53889164.html), with a [projected](https://www.tipmcconsulting.com/) CAGR of 3.7% from 2023-2030.

Yet, while demand soars, supply is tightening:

* premium feedstocks — high-grade rutile and chloride ilmenite — are [increasingly scarce](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/turbulence-in-global-titanium-supply/) outside China, raising costs for Western pigment and metal producers
* certifying new titanium suppliers is a painstaking, [multi-year process](https://projectblue.com/blue/opinion-pieces/1018/russia-considering-export-restrictions-on-raw-materials-including-ti-and-ni) for high-spec applications like aerospace — there is no “quick fix” to turn on new supply.

**Conclusion**

Even with no direct tariffs or export controls on titanium, trade volatility is already acting as a accelerant on underlying fundamental supply-demand dynamics in global titanium supply chains.

Especially in the immediate term, rather than resolving pre-existing issues, these measures have intensified the squeeze on a metal that is already stretched thin by surging demand and a concentrated supply chain.

Efforts to re-shore titanium supply — from sponge to finished metal — remain in early stages, with no quick fix. In the meantime, titanium remains a high-cost chokepoint with little margin for disruption.

**IMHO\~ NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is now positioned at the center of a multi-layered convergence of events:**

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is now advancing through a powerful convergence of project execution, policy alignment, and capital market readiness. With **Phase 1 drilling completed**, an imminent **resource update**, and the **strategic hiring of Ernest Cleave** to drive business development and financing, the company has entered its most consequential stretch to date.

Backed by strong **U.S. government interest** — including a **$10M DoD Title III grant**, active EXIM Bank financing engagement, and alignment with **national defense stockpile priorities** — Elk Creek is positioned as one of America’s most strategically relevant critical minerals projects. Broader U.S. policy trends, such as reshoring mandates, supply chain security, and tariff realignment, provide additional tailwinds as the company approaches its **Q4 2025 DFS**.

Meanwhile, the current ""quiet"" period — between drilling completion and official results — has created a **catalyst vacuum** that some market participants may be using to suppress share price and accumulate ahead of value-unlocking news. This behavior is typical in high-conviction, low-float stories just prior to inflection milestones.

Importantly, while an **anchor investor** has not yet been formally announced, all signs suggest that **strategic players may be waiting in the wings**. Given Elk Creek’s national significance and high-grade, multi-metal resource profile, entities such as the **DoD, Stellantis, Boeing, or other defense-aligned groups** could reasonably step in once the **DFS drops and de-risks the project’s economics**. A government- or OEM-backed anchor investment would likely validate the project’s valuation and unlock follow-on capital.

With global demand/supply pressures intensifying for Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and REEs — and Elk Creek uniquely positioned to supply all four — the next 4–6 months could redefine NioCorp’s market standing. For investors, the combination of fundamentals, timing, and strategic relevance offers a compelling risk/reward window ahead of what could be a transformative Q4–Q1 cycle.

1mw89es,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1mw89es/why_motor_trend_twotone_shield_floor_mats_review/,Why Motor Trend TwoTone Shield Floor Mats Review Deserves Your Attention Today,"The Motor Trend MTMT6644 ChromeTech Car Floor Mats immediately caught my eye due to their striking black and red two-tone design. If you're anything like me and appreciate a functional yet stylish upgrade for your vehicle's interior, this product seems like it checks plenty of boxes. Here’s a breakdown of my experience after putting these mats to the test in my own car—a family SUV that sees its fair share of wear and tear.

**Stylish Design with Two-Tone Accents**  
I’ve got to admit, these mats look fantastic. The combination of black with sleek red chrome accents adds a bit of personality to an otherwise plain interior. I noticed right away how the mats elevated the aesthetic of my car cabin without being over the top. Whether you drive a sedan or an SUV, the universal appeal of the design fits well across various vehicle types.

[Check Motor Trend MTMT6644 price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0ckc1lnmq/)

**Durability That Stands Up to Everyday Life**  
Durability is often my main concern when buying car floor mats, especially since my kids have a knack for spilling snacks and drinks all over the place. These mats, made of high-quality rubber, felt thick and sturdy right out of the box. Over the past week, I tested their endurance with muddy shoes, spilled coffee, and even remnants of a dropped ice cream cone (thanks to my toddler). Cleaning them was a breeze—simply rinsing with a hose did the trick. Not a single crack or deformity in the process, which is a refreshing change from the flimsy mats I’ve used in the past.

**Universal Fit and Easy Installation**  
One feature I appreciated was the universal fit. While my SUV isn’t particularly uncommon, finding mats that cover the floor fully and snugly can be a hassle. These mats were designed to fit most cars, SUVs, trucks, and vans. I had to trim the edges slightly to match the contours of my vehicle perfectly, but this was easy enough to do with scissors. Once in place, the mats stayed securely, thanks to the non-slip backing—a feature that really came in handy during longer drives when constant sliding mats can become an irritation.

**Key Benefits**
- Eye-catching design adds style to your car’s interior.
- Robust, high-quality rubber resists wear, cracking, and extreme conditions.
- Universal fit with customizable trimming options.
- Simple to clean—just hose off or wipe with a damp cloth.

**Practicality for Families and Daily Commutes**  
As someone who spends considerable time cleaning up after a workday or weekend trips, it impressed me how practical these mats are. Whether it was sand from the beach or dirt from school sports fields, they handled debris well with ridges designed to trap messes instead of spreading them around.

**Negatives Worth Noting**  
Of course, there are no perfect products. While I’ve been generally satisfied, a couple of things stood out that might concern others:  
- The red accents, though stylish, might not blend well with every car interior.  
- Customization takes some effort if you prefer a seamless fit.  
- During my first drive, the rubber smell was noticeable, but it faded after airing out overnight.

**Product Rivals**  
After testing these mats, I couldn’t help but compare them to similar products I’ve tried before, like WeatherTech floor liners and Husky floor mats. While both competitors offer exceptional durability, their higher price tags may deter some buyers. The Motor Trend mats hold their ground by offering remarkable quality without the hefty cost. On the other hand, WeatherTech mats provide a more precise fit right out of the box, particularly for specific car models, whereas DIY trimming might frustrate some users of the Motor Trend product.

**Budget-Friendly Functional Upgrade**  
For its price, this product offers solid value. Considering the durability, style, and practicality these mats bring, you’re getting a well-rounded deal. They’re particularly great for anyone seeking a stylish upgrade without spending an arm and a leg. Compared to premium-brand alternatives, they might lack ultra-precise molding but make up for it with affordability and universal use cases.

1mw892w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mw892w/my_engineer_took_the_night_off_what_happened_on/,My Engineer Took the Night Off. What Happened on Mile Marker 211 Still Haunts Me,"Hey!  
I’m back with my new story — this one’s about two train workers who stopped near Mile Marker 211… and shouldn’t have. I also made a full narrated version with visuals on my YouTube channel:  
👉 [https://youtu.be/MrQSozP9U8Q](https://youtu.be/MrQSozP9U8Q) . Let me know what you think!

I’m twenty-two now. Been working the rails for a little over two years.  
First real shift came not long after I finished trade school — barely had the diesel grease washed off my hands before they stuck me out in the woods with a seventy-ton engine and a guy I’d never met.

Not much has scared me since that night. But I still don’t take jobs anywhere near Cold Pines Spur.

I work freight up north — real north. Iron Range country, where the wind off Lake Superior’ll cut through denim like razor wire. Our runs mostly service old lumber operations and half-shuttered mills. A lot of it’s outdated spur lines, the kind nobody upgrades because there’s not enough freight left to justify the cost. It's cold, it's slow, and it pays by the hour.

I got hired on with Northern Timber & Rail right after I got certified. Started out of a depot near Violet Ridge, Minnesota — blink and you miss it, one bar, two gas pumps, and a diner that serves soup out of a coffee machine. I rent a room over a bait shop and live mostly on instant noodles and diner leftovers.

That night — the one I keep coming back to — was two years ago. January. Middle of a cold snap. One of those nights where your lungs sting just from breathing. The fog was so thick you could chew it.

I was curled up in bed, watching some dusty old detective rerun, when my phone rang.  
Frank Holloway.

My usual engineer.

Sixty-two years old, twice divorced, built like a mini-fridge and just as warm. The guy was a lifer — started on steam, stayed for diesel, and outlived three locomotives and most of his hearing.

“Hey, Frank,” I answered. “What’s going on?”

His voice sounded off. Breathy. Uneven. Like he’d been pacing or had something stuck in his throat.

“Jay... I’m not making the shift tonight. Something came up. Personal.”

I sat up. “You alright?”

“I’m fine. Just... not tonight, okay? Talk to dispatch when you get in. They’ll pair you with someone.”

There was a weird pause.

Then, sharply:  
“Don’t half-ass the engine. I want that thing clean enough to eat off when I’m back.”

I laughed. “Yes, sir. No slacking. Got it. Be safe, alright?”

He didn’t reply. Just hung up.

Something about the call bugged me. Frank wasn’t the sentimental type, but his voice had this... off-key edge to it. Like something was crawling under his skin.

I tried not to overthink it.

By 7:30, I was dressed, packed, and headed into the whiteout. The fog had thickened to the point I couldn’t see the end of my street. Everything was muffled — like the snow was absorbing sound. Even my boots sounded too quiet.

When I checked in at dispatch, they paired me with a guy I’d never worked with before: Rob Talbot, 26, fresh out of the company’s conductor training in Brainerd. Tall, buzzcut, friendly enough. Wore a Red Wings beanie and talked fast, like a guy trying to prove he belonged.

“You’re with me tonight,” he said, flipping through the manifest. “We’re hauling empties out to Cold Pines Spur.”

“First time out there,” I said. “Didn’t even know it was still in use.”

He laughed. “Barely. The old Cold Pines mill runs on fumes these days. Maybe one or two night runs a week. Dispatch likes to send new guys there. Less traffic. Less pressure.”

I didn’t love the idea of running into the woods on a barely-used spur in zero-visibility fog, but I wasn’t about to complain.

We rolled out just after 9:00 PM in GP9 #1543, a cranky old diesel-electric that smelled like scorched belts and frozen rubber. Thing groaned like a haunted vending machine every time we picked up speed.

The fog only got worse past mile 30. High beams barely cut through five feet of it. Everything looked like we were driving into a sheet of cotton.

Inside the cab, we talked a little. Rob seemed chill — more into his phone than his throttle, but competent enough. I brewed weak coffee in my dented thermos and cracked a window for a smoke. Frank never let me smoke in the cab. Rob didn’t even blink.

I asked him if he’d run Cold Pines before.  
“Couple times,” he said. “Quiet stretch. Middle of nowhere. No signals, no crossings, no wildlife ‘cept maybe a fox or two.”

Then he added, without changing tone:

“Some folks say it’s haunted. You believe in that crap?”

I laughed it off. “Only when the overtime dries up.”

We’re on the clock, but technically there’s no lunch break — just “equipment inspection” windows. Everyone knows the routine: you stop somewhere remote, park the engine, kill the lights, and pretend to check couplers for an hour or two while you nap.

At 1:13 AM, dispatch called in with the formal go-ahead.

“Engine 1543, Cold Pines Spur — authorized technical stop. Log inspection. Over.”

Rob eased us to a halt in the middle of nowhere. No lights. No sound. Just fog, pines, and the long quiet hum of the cooling engine.

He threw his boots up on the console and said, “Your turn to play inspector. Go hit it with the hammer, rookie.”

I grabbed my gear and stepped into the dark.

The cold bit like a live wire. Even through my insulated gloves, I could feel it chew at my knuckles. The snow reached my shins. I walked the length of the engine, checking suspension, brake lines, couplers. Nothing looked off. Just a standard walkaround.

I was heading back when something caught my eye off to the left.

In the trees.

Metal.  
Faintly glinting. Almost buried.

I stepped off the embankment, flashlight beam bouncing through the fog like it was underwater. Knees deep in snow, I pulled away a tangle of branches.

A rusted metal number plate.

Frostbitten. Bent. But still legible:

GP9 — 211

Not our engine. Ours was 1543.

This thing looked like it’d been out here since the Carter administration.

That’s when I heard it.

A snap. Behind me.

Like a frozen branch — or a bone.

I turned.

Swept my light across the trees.

At first, I thought it was nothing — until I saw them.

Two pale reflections. Eye-level. Not animal. Not human. Just... staring.

They didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

And then, like someone cut the power, they vanished.

No footfalls. No leaves. No sound.

Just gone.

I gripped the number plate tighter and turned back toward the track. Toward the engine.

But it wasn’t there.

The headlamps were gone.

The metal hum of the generator — gone.

Just trees.

Just fog.

And snow, already starting to erase my footprints.

At first, I thought I must’ve gotten turned around. Fog can do that — mess with your sense of distance. But I knew I hadn’t walked that far. I’d gone maybe thirty, forty yards off the embankment. The engine should’ve been right behind me.

I spun in a slow circle. Trees. Fog. More trees.

No rumble of diesel. No cab lights. No Rob, feet on the console, thumbing through his phone.

Just me.

Just white silence and the slow crunch of my own boots as I shifted my weight.

Something in the air had changed. The cold was deeper now — not just freezing but *still*. Heavy. Like the snow itself was holding its breath.

I started walking, number plate tucked under my arm, scanning for any sign of the train. Every step felt heavier. The snow wasn’t deeper, but my boots sank like the ground was softer. Off. *Wrong*.

After maybe ten minutes of stumbling, I stopped.

And that’s when I noticed something else.

No sound.

No trees creaking.

No wind.

Not even the distant hum of power from the engine.

Dead silence.

Total.

That’s when I heard it again.

Crunch.

But not mine.

Not footsteps, either.

Something different.

Wet.  
Like tendons grinding.  
Like a joint bending the wrong way.

Then another.

Crrrk.  
Like a neck being twisted too far. Bone on bone.

I raised the flashlight and slowly turned toward the sound.

There — in the fog — maybe ten yards out:

Two glowing eyes. Same height as before. But closer.

Too close.

And this time... they *moved*.

Not forward. Not side to side.

They drifted. Circling.

Drawing wide, slow eights in the fog.  
Like a predator testing the shape of its prey.

I didn’t breathe. My heart punched against my ribs, adrenaline flooding my legs.

I whispered to myself:

“Run.”

And I *did*.

I tore through the trees, crashing over roots and frozen brush, snow soaking into my coveralls. I didn’t care. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. My brain wouldn’t let me.

Every instinct screamed the same thing:  
Don’t stop. Don’t turn. Don’t let it catch up.

Branches scraped my shoulders. I slipped, slammed into a trunk, righted myself, kept moving.

I didn’t know which way the tracks were anymore. Everything looked the same — fog, trees, white on white on white.

Then I saw it — a break in the treeline.

The embankment. The ballast slope of the railbed.

I scrambled up like a rat from a flood, boots slipping on frozen gravel. Made it to the middle of the tracks and stopped, panting, dizzy.

And just like that —  
the feeling lifted.

A flicker of relief.

But... something was wrong.

I turned. Looked both ways.

No engine.

No lights.

No train.

Just rusted rails, stretching in both directions, covered in snow. The ties beneath me weren’t concrete like on our spur line — they were old wood, splintered, weatherworn, creosote-soaked.

I frowned and kicked at one of them with my boot.

The wood cracked under the toe — dry rot.  
These tracks hadn’t seen service in *decades*.

No fresh polish on the rail tops. No warmth from metal that had been under an engine minutes ago.

This wasn’t our line.

I started walking, heading the way I *thought* the train had stopped. Fog swallowed everything beyond twenty feet. My flashlight bounced along the rail, catching flakes and shadows that shifted the more I focused on them.

Then I saw it — a mile marker.

Old concrete post. Faded, chipped. Mounted low to the ground, half-buried in snow.

I wiped the frost off the metal plate:

Mile Marker 211

I froze.

That couldn’t be right.

Cold Pines Spur was only fifteen miles long — it didn’t have numbered mile markers like this. And our manifest listed no marker 211 anywhere on the route.

This track didn’t exist.

Not anymore.

I stood there, heart racing, trying to make sense of it — when I heard it again.

Crrrk.

Right behind me.

Not just near me — right behind me.

So close I could feel it in my own spine.

My stomach turned cold.

I reached slowly into my vest pocket, fingers brushing the hammer. Grip slick with nervous sweat.

I turned.

And saw it.

It stood on the rail.  
Not moving.

Not blinking.

Human-shaped — but not human.

Tall, gaunt, bone-pale in the fog, wearing what looked like a torn nightgown or dress. One arm hung at an unnatural angle, elbow reversed, fingers twitching. Its skin looked damp, stretched too thin across the joints.

Its head tilted.

Then twisted, vertebrae cracking one by one as it rotated — not just to the side, but *backward*, slowly, like it was dislocating its own neck to look at me.

The face was... shattered.

Bits of skull showed through a torn scalp. Long strands of gray hair clung to frozen skin. One side of its mouth was torn open to the cheek — a permanent grin. Teeth yellowed and too many.  
And the eyes — bright, white, glowing green from within — locked on me like it already knew how I’d taste.

But worse — worse than all of that —

It was holding something.

Wrapped in old, wet newspaper.  
A bundle.  
A shape.

Two tiny legs dangled out.

A baby.

Something inside me snapped.

I shouted. Raised the hammer, ready to strike, knowing I’d die but wanting to *do something* before it took me apart.

And then—

A blur behind it.

A hand.

A hammer.

Crack.

Steel connected with the thing’s skull — sunk deep into the temple. A splash of dark fluid sprayed out, sizzling against snow.

The creature shrieked — not with pain, but like it had been *insulted*. It jerked, twisted around at something behind it, and — without a sound — bolted into the trees.

The woods swallowed it instantly.

I stood there, breathing like a cornered dog, hammer still raised.

And from the fog stepped a man.

Old.

Wearing a faded conductor’s uniform — navy blue with silver trim. Cap pulled low. Heavy coat, old-style boots, a metal lantern swinging from one hand.

He had a wide, serious face. Thick white mustache. Eyes like glass bottle-green. Steady. Focused.

He looked at me, then down at the fallen number plate beside my boot. I hadn’t realized I’d dropped it.

He stooped, picked it up, brushed snow off it with one gloved hand.

“You don’t belong here, son.”

His voice was low, deep, like a freight train under throttle. Calm, but full of warning.

“This place don’t take kindly to souvenirs.”

“You don’t belong here, son.”

The old man’s voice wasn’t angry — but it wasn’t friendly either. Like a stern uncle catching you somewhere you weren’t supposed to be.

He stared at the number plate in his hands — GP9 – 211 — and his face changed. Not with fear. Not even surprise. Just... resignation. Like he’d seen it before. Like it was expected.

“You dropped this,” he said.

“You can keep it.”

He gave me a sharp look and stepped forward, placing the plate under one arm like it was his. Maybe it always had been.

He looked me over.

“You’re with Holloway, right? Frank?”

I blinked. “Yeah. Not tonight, though. I got paired with—”

“Doesn’t matter.” He waved it off. “You tell Frank Old Man Connor said hello. Tell him I still remember what he owes me.”

My stomach twisted.

“Wait,” I said. “You’re Connor?”

He nodded once, crisp. “Used to run the 211 line. Back before they tore it up. Before the Cold Pines reroute.”

My throat went dry.  
That number. The plate. The engine. The mile marker. It was all the same line.

I stepped back, heart pounding again.

“Is this... are you—?“

“I’m what’s left,” he said, cutting me off. “Don’t think too hard about it. Won’t help.”

He turned and pointed back the way I’d come — only now I realized... I could see track lights in the distance. The fog had shifted. Just a little.

“That’s your line,” he said. “Real one. Keep walking. Don’t stop. Don’t turn. And whatever you do...”

He looked at me, dead serious.

“Don’t take anything with you.”

I looked down — the plate was gone from the snow. Still tucked under his arm.

Something about the way he held it — like it was more than metal. Like it was *anchor*. Weight.

“What the hell was that thing?” I asked.

“Her?” he said, voice suddenly softer. “Some memories don’t die right. Some keep walking. Screaming. Crying for what they lost.”

He turned again, starting to disappear into the mist.

“What did she lose?”

He didn’t stop walking.

“Everything.”

And then he was gone.

I walked.

I don’t know how long. Maybe a mile. Maybe five minutes. Maybe an hour.

But eventually, the fog thinned — and I saw it.

The engine.

GP9 #1543.

Sitting exactly where we’d parked it.

Lights on. Diesel humming. Like nothing had ever happened.

I climbed up fast, threw the cab door open, nearly tripping over myself.

“Jesus!” Rob shouted, jumping. “Dude, where the hell were you?”

I couldn’t speak right away. My throat burned from the cold and fear and whatever the hell had just happened. I dropped into the seat and tried to breathe.

“You’re pale as hell,” Rob said. “You okay? You fall or something?”

I just nodded, slow. “Inspection took longer than I thought.”

He gave me a weird look, but didn’t push.

“We’re almost done anyway. Dispatch just cleared us for reverse pull. Let’s get the hell outta here before the weather gets worse.”

Music to my ears.

We rolled back toward Violet Ridge. Trees on either side still looked the same — heavy, dark, breathless. But the further we got from Mile Marker 211, the easier it was to breathe.

I didn’t say a word the whole ride back. Rob didn’t notice. He had earbuds in, scrolling something on his phone.

When we hit the yard, we handed off the paperwork and clocked out. My hands were still shaking.

At sunrise, I sat behind the depot with a cigarette I wasn’t supposed to have. I watched the breath rise off my fingers and tried not to think about what I’d seen. What I’d *felt*.

That’s when I overheard the old-timers talking.

There’s this little makeshift smoke shack behind the yard office. Real classy — sheet metal walls, bucket for a chair, and a cracked thermos someone left in 1998. But the guys love it. They say more truth gets passed around in that shack than in any union meeting.

That morning, they were talking about Frank Holloway.

“He asked for the night off?”

“First time in twenty years.”

“He always goes quiet this time of year. You know what happened, right?”

“Yeah. That old derailment. Cold Pines, before the reroute.”

I leaned in just enough to hear, keeping my mouth shut.

“He was on that train. Back when it was still the 211 line. His engineer — Connor Reeves — died keeping the brake engaged so Frank could jump.”

“Yeah. Heard Frank sees him sometimes. Swears he’s still out there.”

“Well, hell. Maybe he is.”

They laughed. The kind of laugh men use when they *don’t* think it’s funny but can’t admit they’re scared.

I caught one of the mechanics later — Eli — and asked him straight.

“You ever hear of GP9 number 211?”

He looked at me a long time.

“Yeah,” he said finally. “Came off the line in ’59. Ran the Cold Pines Spur for about fifteen years. Derailment killed the engineer. They pulled the rails after that. Didn’t even salvage the engine — buried it out there.”

“Buried?”

“Ground was too unstable to haul it out. The car behind it — log carrier — was empty. Lucky.”

He paused.

“Why you ask?”

I hesitated.

“Saw something out there. A plate. Number matched.”

He stopped chewing. His jaw just hung there for a second.

“Don’t touch anything out there,” he said quietly. “Don’t bring anything back. Not even rust.”

Then he walked off.

I put in for a transfer a week later.

Took a pay cut. Moved back downstate. Smaller depot. Safer routes.

Frank retired that spring. I never saw him again.

But sometimes, on nights when the fog rolls in thick and the engines hum just *so*, I think about Mile Marker 211.

About the thing that walked out of the trees holding a dead child.

About the man who warned me just in time.

And about how *close* I came to joining them.

 

I couldn’t stop thinking about the plate.

GP9 – 211.  
Old Man Connor’s train.

Buried, not scrapped. Left to rot somewhere in that frostbitten stretch of nowhere, entombed with whatever still walked those woods. I kept hearing the way he’d said it:

“Some memories don’t die right.”

I didn’t sleep much that week. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that thing. Its neck bending backward. Its smile too wide. The limp bundle in its arms.

I tried convincing myself it was a hallucination — hypothermia, fatigue, a stress-dream. But there were things I couldn’t explain:

* The number plate.
* The mile marker that didn’t exist on any current map.
* The old man in the conductor’s uniform... who shouldn’t have been there.

Or *couldn’t*.

I spent three nights researching. Rail archives, crash logs, railfan forums. Anything I could dig up on Cold Pines Spur, Mile Marker 211, or engine 211 itself.

Most of it was dead ends — until I found a scanned clipping from a local paper, dated January 17th, 1977.

“DERAILMENT ON NORTHERN TIMBER LINE CLAIMS ENGINEER’S LIFE”  
*“Early Sunday morning, a GP9 locomotive derailed near mile marker 211 on the Cold Pines Spur, resulting in the death of 57-year-old conductor Connor Reeves. Investigators cite missing rail anchors and loose ballast as possible causes. The assistant engineer, Frank Holloway, survived the incident with minor injuries. Eyewitness accounts indicate Reeves stayed in the cabin to manually engage the emergency brakes while instructing Holloway to evacuate. No other crew were onboard. No cargo was being hauled at the time.”*

My blood ran cold.

It was all true.

The derailment. The mile marker. Frank.

And Connor… he’d died holding the brake, keeping the engine from tumbling into the ravine with both of them onboard.

There was one more name mentioned in the article. A short, sad footnote at the bottom.

“The incident occurred less than a mile from where a woman and infant were struck and killed by a Northern Timber locomotive in 1963. The location has long been considered a ‘troubled’ section of track by employees.”

No other details.

No names.

I dug deeper.

Eventually, I found a digitized coroner’s report — barely readable, yellowed scan, probably forgotten in some microfiche archive for decades.

Name: Louise Everett  
Date of Death: February 3, 1963  
Cause: Blunt-force trauma, consistent with railway impact.  
Notes: Victim was found on tracks with deceased infant in arms. History of postpartum psychosis noted.  
Next of kin: James Everett — engineer, Northern Timber Line.

That was it.

She wasn’t just a casualty.

She was the engineer’s wife.

She’d lost her mind. Took their baby and walked into her husband’s line of travel. He was running the train that night. There was nothing he could do.

She waited for him.

And made him watch.

Suddenly, the pieces started falling into place.

That thing I’d seen — the dress, the twisted limbs, the baby — it wasn’t random.

It wasn’t just a ghost.

It was *her*.

Louise Everett.

Still walking the tracks.

Still cradling what was left.

Still screaming, *quietly*, for something no one could give back.

And the 211 line — that stretch of rail — had soaked it all in.

The grief. The trauma. The broken metal and shattered people.

Connor died trying to hold it together.

Frank survived and *never went back*.

The company rerouted everything away from that section not long after. Official reason? ""Structural instability."" Unofficially? The crews just stopped going. Too many stories. Too many close calls. Too much *wrong*.

Even the new spur — Cold Pines — was built to bend around that area. Avoid the old scar. But sometimes, on long nights, in the right fog...

You still cross it.

I thought about confronting Frank.

About going to his house, or calling him, just to ask what he really saw that night in ‘77.

But something stopped me.

Maybe I didn’t want to hear it. Maybe I already *knew*.

Instead, I waited a few days, then went back to the shop.

There was an old locker in the far corner of the depot. Rusted. Padlock busted. Used to belong to one of the retirees — the kind of guy who never threw anything out.

Inside were stacks of manuals, parts catalogs, faded engineer caps.

And pinned to the back wall, half-covered in dust:

A photo.

Two men, standing in front of a diesel engine.  
GP9 – 211.  
Clean. Shiny. New.

One man I didn’t recognize.

The other — unmistakably Frank Holloway.

Young. Smiling.

Alive.

I don’t know what possessed me to take it.

But I did.

I slipped the photo into my wallet and left the depot without saying a word.

That night, I had the first nightmare in weeks.

A screech of metal.  
The *clang* of a brake lever.  
A woman’s voice whispering something I couldn’t understand.

And in the fog — a lantern.  
Swinging.  
Getting closer.

I told myself I was done.

That whatever happened out there—on that stretch of Cold Pines Spur—was a one-time thing. A bad dream. A cold night gone worse.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

Not the thing in the trees. Not the dead child. Not even Connor.

It was the number that haunted me.

211.

The mile marker.  
The engine.  
The date on the old newspaper article.  
The sound of the radio transmission that hadn’t been broadcast in forty years.

I started to realize something:  
That number wasn’t random.

It was a pattern.

A mark.

A grave.

Three weeks passed.

Then the nightmares started again.

But this time, they didn’t feel like memories.

They felt like instructions.

I’d wake up cold and sweating, with that number in my head like a countdown.

So I did the one thing I promised myself I wouldn’t do.

I went back.

I didn’t take a rail vehicle.

I drove up past Ely in my truck, alone. No company vest. No gear. Just a flashlight, boots, and my coffee thermos. January again—of course it was. Same kind of night: bitter cold, fog so thick it turned the headlights to milk.

I parked near the split where Cold Pines Spur diverged from the main. There’s no signage anymore. No reason for anyone to go past that point.

Except me.

I walked.

The trees were silent.

Fog blanketed everything. The deeper I went, the more I felt like I was walking through a tunnel—walls made of pine, roof made of dead air.

And then I saw it.

The rails.

Same as before—rusted, warped, forgotten. And just ahead, like it had been waiting:

Mile Marker 211.

A chipped concrete post with a rust-stained steel faceplate. Crooked in the ground, but still standing.

I knelt and brushed snow off the base.

There were scratch marks—rough and uneven.

Letters.

Almost worn away.

L O U I

That was it. Like someone started writing LOUISE, and stopped. Or never finished.

A cold wind pushed through the trees.

And then I heard the crunch behind me.

I turned fast.

Connor stood at the tree line.

Same long coat. Same old lantern. Eyes sharper this time.

He walked toward me, slow but sure, and stopped beside the mile marker.

“Back again,” he said.

“I need answers,” I told him.

He nodded, like he expected that.

“The 211 engine went off the track right here,” he said. “Back in '77. You already know that.”

“I do.”

“What you don’t know,” he continued, “is that this marker... this stretch of rail... wasn’t always mile 211.”

I blinked. “What?”

He pointed at the post. “When the company laid new rail out here in the '60s, they renumbered segments. Shortcuts. Accounting tricks. They moved the numbers around. But she didn’t forget.”

I felt the hair rise on my arms.

“So the number…”

“She took it,” he said. “Tied it to the place. Made it hers.”

“And the engine?”

“GP9 #211,” he said, with a bitter laugh. “Guess what mile we reached when she stepped onto the tracks? Mile 211. Of course it was. She waited for him there. Her husband. The engineer.”

He looked up at me, dead serious.

“That number doesn’t just mark a place. It marks a cycle. That engine didn’t derail by accident. It was pulled off. Brought home. Back to her.”

“So it’s... like a loop?”

He shook his head. “No. Worse. It’s a route. A scheduled run. She’s not stuck here. She’s still traveling it. Over and over.”

Then he looked at me, hard.

“And now you’ve stepped on it.”

Fog thickened again.

From the distance came a low hum, not mechanical — more like electricity in the teeth.

Connor looked back down the track.

“It’s coming,” he said. “She’s always on time.”

“What do I do?”

“Get off the line. And don’t look back.”

“But what about you?”

He smiled, sadly.

“I never got off the train.”

I ran.

Didn’t ask how. Didn’t think. Just ran.

Snow kicked up behind me as the trees blurred past. That hum grew louder — deeper — and beneath it, I heard screaming.

A woman’s voice.

A child crying.

A conductor shouting to pull the brake.

I reached the crossing road near the split and dove behind the tree line just as the fog surged forward — like a wave swallowing everything.

Then it passed.

And everything went quiet again.

I didn’t go back.

Not for a long time.

I transferred routes. Took yard shifts. Never went north again.

But a few days ago, I got a package.

No return address. No stamp.

Inside:

A small metal tag.

Scorched. Pitted. Letters barely visible.

But still there.

Mile Marker 212

No note.

Just that.

I don’t sleep much these days.

Because now I understand.

It’s not a haunting.

It’s a timetable.

And she’s still making her run.

1mw85p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mw85p5/does_waterdrop_wdg3n1cf_filter_really_improve/,Does Waterdrop WD-G3-N1CF Filter Really Improve Water Taste? Detailed Review Inside!,"The Waterdrop WD-G3-CF filter has been a part of my daily routine for the past few weeks, and I must say, it's changed how I think about water filtration. Installing it into my reverse osmosis system was refreshingly straightforward. As someone using the Waterdrop WD-G3-N1CF filter with the compatible G3-W and G3P series systems, I immediately noticed the difference in the taste and clarity of my water. But let's dive deeper into what makes this product stand out—and where it could be improved.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing this filter reminded me how much I appreciate products designed to prioritize user convenience. With the twist-and-lock mechanism, the replacement process took me less than three seconds—no tools, no mess. I didn’t have to fumble with complicated parts, which is a blessing, especially on busy mornings. Unlike other filters that often turn installation projects into hours-long nightmares, this one truly wins in terms of simplicity.

**Check [Waterdrop WD-G3-N1CF] price on Amazon.**

**Filtration Performance**  
The 3-in-1 filtration system offered by this filter is impressive. Using coconut shell-activated carbon, it effectively reduces common impurities like sand, rust, and particulates. It’s also adept at eliminating residual chlorine odors. I’m a bit of a water quality nerd, and I tested its performance with a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter. Although reverse osmosis does most of the heavy lifting, this filter added that final polish, making the water taste crisp and clean. I even noticed my coffee tasted better, which says a lot, as I can be picky about that.

**Build Quality and Materials**  
I’ve always been cautious about what filters are made of, so I appreciate that the material used here is natural coconut shell-activated carbon. Being NSF-certified adds another layer of trust, ensuring that it meets high safety standards. The design feels solid, and the compact dimensions of 3.3"" x 3.3"" x 12.1"" make it versatile enough to fit under most sinks without taking up much space. That said, the white color tends to show dust quickly if you're not regularly cleaning your setup—but that's a minor nitpick.

**Water Capacity and Lifespan**  
The lifespan of this filter impressed me. The promise of six months or 550 gallons of filtration means I don’t need constant replacements, cutting down on inconvenience and waste. In my household of four, this longevity holds up quite well, and I’ve yet to experience any reduction in water flow or quality. For anyone using filtered water for cooking, drinking, and making ice, it’s an excellent solution.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Simple and intuitive installation process.  
- Exceptional water taste improvement thanks to the coconut shell-activated carbon.  
- Long filtration lifespan minimizes frequent replacement hassles.  

**Critiques**  
- The filter is relatively lightweight, which might feel less premium for some users.  
- Slightly higher price point compared to standard filters, but the quality justifies it.  

**Market Rivals**  
Other competing filters, like the APEC or iSpring models, have unique strengths, but they also come with trade-offs. While APEC models might deliver similar filtration, they’re notorious for being more cumbersome to install. On the other hand, iSpring’s designs tend to be bulkier, consuming much more space under the sink. The Waterdrop filter stands out with its slim dimensions and efficient twist-to-install feature. However, both competitors do a slightly better job catering to those with larger water consumption needs, offering filters that can last longer than 550 gallons. That said, when it comes to balancing efficiency, filtration quality, and value, the Waterdrop finds its niche.

**True Value**  
Although it leans slightly toward the pricier end, the features and results make it feel like a worthy investment. I’ve spent years dealing with lower-tier filters that compromise either on lifespan or water quality, and most of them felt uninspiring. This product restores that confidence in spending money on a filter that actually delivers on its promises. Anyone sticking to a budget might hesitate initially, but considering its half-year durability and added convenience, I absolutely think it’s worth every penny.

1mw82c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1mw82c9/should_you_try_sprayway_glass_cleaner_wipes_for/,Should You Try Sprayway Glass Cleaner Wipes for Spotless Shine,"Testing out the Sprayway SW199R-6PK felt like tackling one of those everyday annoyances head-on. Glass cleaning has never been a thrilling task for me, but these pre-moistened wipes promise to change the game. The resealable packaging intrigued me right away—I mean, who doesn’t like convenience? I gave these a try across various glass surfaces in my house, hoping the fuss-free solution they claim would deliver. Let me walk you through what I discovered using these over the last few weeks.

**Convenient Design for Everyday Use**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the packaging. Each pack contains 20 wipes, neatly sealed in a compact, resealable pouch. I tossed one in my car, another in the kitchen drawer, and kept a backup in my cleaning stash. That resealable opening is a huge plus—it keeps the wipes moist even if, like me, you don’t finish the pack right away. I won’t lie, the design screams practicality, and I’ve grabbed these wipes in moments when I didn’t want to deal with sprays and towels. Anything to make life easier, right? 

[Check Sprayway SW199R-6PK price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0d8k4xrdz/)

**Performance Across Glass Surfaces**  
The product’s promise to clean all types of glass surfaces wasn’t an exaggeration. I tried them on car windows, bathroom mirrors, and even my coffee table. Each time, the wipes were quick to banish fingerprints, streaks, and dust. Its ammonia-free formula made me feel better about using it on my kid’s bedroom window, where smudges are a daily phenomenon. The wipes handled grimy spots from sticky little fingers without leaving residues. What’s more, eliminating the smoke film on my balcony glass was unexpectedly easy, making them ideal for those hard-to-reach outdoor surfaces.

**Original Formula Without Harsh Odors**  
I’ve had bad experiences with overly harsh cleaning products, so finding out these were ammonia-free was a relief. There's no strong chemical smell to knock you backward. Instead, it has a light, almost neutral scent, which made cleaning far less of a chore. Honestly, after trying this, I don’t think I’ll ever go back to ammonia-loaded alternatives that suffocate you before you can even clean the glass.

**Positives**  
Pre-moistened wipes are incredibly convenient.  
Suitable for all glass surfaces—no need to juggle multiple products.  
Ammonia-free formula feels safer for home use.  

**Disadvantages**  
While testing these wipes, it wasn’t all positive. Here’s what I noticed:  

Wipes aren’t reusable, which feels less eco-friendly.  
On heavily stained glass, I found myself needing two wipes instead of one.  

**Competing Brands**  
Before committing to these wipes, I did compare them with a couple of other popular alternatives. One competitor, Windex wipes, also claims great streak-free results but leans heavily into their ammonia-based formula. While Windex might shine on sturdier surfaces, Sprayway wipes have the upper hand for a less toxic cleaning experience. Another player in the scene, Invisible Glass wipes, boasts streak-free cleaning but falls flat in its packaging usability—it lacked the long-lasting “stay moist” factor I saw with Sprayway’s resealable packs. The Sprayway wipes balance ease, safety, and effectiveness, clearly setting them apart in terms of practicality.

**Price Worthiness**  
To be fair, you could argue over whether glass cleaning wipes like these are a luxury or a necessity. However, the convenience and the residue-free results ultimately justify the investment. Compared to liquid sprays that need separate cloths (and leave streaks if you're not quick with the wipe), these wipes provided a more efficient, hassle-free solution. The cost efficiency becomes even clearer when you consider the time saved from not needing extra tools. Tossing a pack of these in my car for emergency window touch-ups proved worth every penny. If you’re big on convenience and don’t mind spending just a bit more for less hassle, these are a solid bet.

How are you all doing today? I hope your week has been good. I've been watching my dad's dogs this week. Love 'em, but they collectively have two brain cells fighting for 3rd place. They are certainly something. But I will not keep you. This week and next week we have Martinez at the party, after that it is time for Chekov's gun to go off. 

Lets get this bread

  
\------

Martinez gazed through the rear window, watching Lysa linger in the doorway. A knot formed in his throat, seeing her watch him so longingly. 

“If you keep frowning like that, no one will talk to you at the gala,’ Chloe quipped, snapping Martinez’s attention back from Lysa to the car. 

“Not many reasons to smile these days,” Martinez replied, looking back from the window toward Chloe and, of all people, one of the other troopers from Blondie's crew. 

This Human man was one of the few that Martinez had seen when he was dragged out to the compound a few months ago. The man was not tall, and he exuded an odd confidence. He gave off the everyman vibe, like he was the type of person who faded into nonexistence the moment your eyes had moved away from where he last was. 

A grey man archetype through and through. He could easily be misidentified if he were in a lineup.

Rat was clad in a pristine navy blue suit with a red tie. He was completely hairless, to the point that it seemed like he could not grow any facial hair even if he wished to. The man barely had any eyebrows; his light brown brow was as thin as if penciled on.

Rat looked back across the way at Martinez. His eyes were cold and dead, all business, with not a flicker of joy. “Then find something to be happy about. It ain’t like your life is all that bad.”

Martinez was about to tell the LOST trooper to shove his opinion up his ass, and that the man had no idea about what his life was like, but the words very nearly failed to pull themselves from his lungs. The man’s mere presence bore down with a *been there, done that, killed ’em all* feeling most of the LOST did. But he was different: darkly, endlessly so.

Unlike Mouse, Blondie, Tech, and many of the others who, while they were hardasses and clearly were well-experienced, were still warm individuals—at least to those they interacted with—Rat, however, the cutting glare he shot at Martinez right before he tried to respond was a lonely, frigid blizzard. It was as if he were a being of unknowable torment from the darkest reaches of space.

His razor-like grey eyes slammed into Martinez’s willingness and warned him with no uncertainty. “If you think you have it bad, I will kill you right where you stand.” The outburst rebounded: a sharp blare, then deafening silence.

Instead of arguing with the man about it, Martinez stayed silent and looked back out the window, letting the snow pile against the glass. He thought about that look Rat had, like a thousand light-years stare. The man was gazing into the void of life.

Martinez contemplated what a person would have to endure to achieve such a look. A life to drive a man to such a state would be one that Martinez would wish on his worst enemies. A life like that would be overflowing with suffering: death, love, loss, pain, struggle, failure, and above all, no hope or light at the end of the tunnel.

To reach that state, there could only be nothingness, an endless, uncaring ocean, waves battering the hull, every calm broken by another storm.that battered against your hull in the dark. Cold waves washing over your body each time you felt you began to grow comfortable with the torment; that frigid splash accompanied by a new gale force wind, driving your boat deeper into the storm, assuring you could never escape.

The remainder of the drive was calm and took the group well over an hour. The length of the journey was capitalized on by Chloe; she took the opportunity to brief Martinez and Rat about the expectations for the evening as well as the roles each would be undertaking to assure the ends she desired were met.

For Rat, his role was an easy one. All he had to do was linger around nearby, not draw attention to himself, and stay sober and ready to pull Martinez and Chloe out of any hot water that might develop. That and keep tabs on communications for anything that would require them to escape right then and act on the evolving situation.

For instance, if Lysa and Mouse are attacked. In cases like that, Everyone in Chloe's command would react with judicious violence.

Martinez, on the other hand, had a far more painful existence within this little game of hers. Martinez was destined to be by her side like a good dog and bark on command. He had the oh-so-envied role of being the shining star of exactly what Humanity could be.

Martinez rolled his eyes at the way Chloe was going to try to sell him to the alien diplomats. Henry Martinez: war hero, Human Sailor, Corpsman, and soon-to-be family man. Not the broken, beaten down, and ragged man he knew himself to be.

He did not argue about it. If she thought the diplomats and others would believe it, all he could do was shut up, smile wide, and go with the flow. Or, as Martinez’s dear friend Dee would say: “Pay it no mind, pay it no matter.” In essence, it's saying you can’t change it, but you are going to do it anyway.

That thought dug into Martinez. He was not playing this role for Lysa and their children, it was for Dee. That man was about to be stoplossed, and Chloe dangled his freedom before him as a suculant bit of bait for his compliance.

Perched high up on a hill with a commanding view of the twinkling city skyline sat the villa they would spend the evening in. Brilliant and imposing, the villa’s pink-and-white marble columns dripped with eons of wealth.

Massive windows tucked just beyond a vast garden filled with hedges and the skeletons of thorny flower bushes.

Warm, inviting orange light poured out of the windows, silhouetting shifting shadows of the other attendees, showing off the vast number of species across the snow. Their movements looked like a god’s shadow puppets., Laughing cruel, unknowable entities of existences that stand at such a vast berth from Martinez, they might as well be extradimensional.

Once the car rolled to a stop, Chloe held up a hand to stop Martinez from getting out of the vehicle.

“Wait, Rat will get the door.” Chloe said, holding a hand to Martinez's chest. ""We have an image to uphold.""

“Yeah, you big fuckin’ hero. Let the help handle that,’ Rat sneered, his voice dripping with contempt.

“He is right,” Chloe added, seeing Martinez seethe as Rat leisurely made his way around the car.

“About what?” Martinez asked.

“Letting the help do their job,” Chloe replied, then pointing at Martinez and then back at herself.

“We are guests, and you are a guest of honor. Let the servants help you. They are your lesser.”|

“Fine,” Martinez reluctantly agreed, knowing this was all part of the grand act Chloe was doing.

Rat opened the car door and offered Chloe a hand; his careful guidance ensured that the woman did not slip on the icy duracrete with her high heels. Martinez was not provided such a courtesy.

As they neared the top of the grand staircase, Chloe gestured at the statues lining the railings and explained the storied history of their gracious host. “That is Orachir, and as you can see, he is a Jurintik and not only that, but he is from one of the high clans from their home planet. Specifically, the Daruga Clan. His great-grandfather, or as he would call him, elder chief, cornered the precious metal market on their planet and used his influence to gain great favor within the GU, to the point ninety percent of all precious metals on this side of the Milky Way are collected from his mining operations within the asteroid belts he has staked claim to. Interesting, correct?” 

“Uhhh, sure, but I still don’t exactly see why I am here.” Martinez commented, still not entirely grasping what Chloe needed him to do other than be kind and courteous; she had to be working some kind of angle on this werewolf-like alien, but he could not see the whole scope of the four-dimensional spook chess she was playing. 

“Ahh, yes, you need to ingratiate yourself with the man of the hour,” Chloe said before shaking her head and sighing. “He has never once served a day in the military, nor has he had anything but a silver spoon life, but he has a near delusion about military might, and warrior culture.” 

“That's strange,” Martinez said, looking up the stairs at a pair of Jurintik guards. Both were decked out in the most high-tech military kit he had seen. It was very comparable to the Artemis armor that the L.O.S.T used: rigid ceramic plates, thin undersuits, pouches woven through both materials, and, of course, a staple of modern advanced militaries, sealed and reflective visored helmets.

The purpose of helmets like that was legion, but the primary reasons were obvious. The lack of eye contact was intimidating to most species; their sealed design meant they acted like gas masks, heads-up displays, and, naturally, their hardened designs acted as the old metal buckets from Old Earth. 

“The spoiled brat simply has a hard-on for the history of his culture as warriors, despite being so disconnected.” Chloe replied, her eyes scanning the two soldiers at the stairs' apex. 

“So you want me to butter him up?” Martinez confirmed. 

“Correct,” Chloe nodded, stepping past the soldiers, who gave the group a firm, stoic nod; their HUDs identifying the trio: Martinez and Chloe as themselves, and Rat, the made-up enigmatic backstory Chloe had drummed up for the man to fit tonight's operational needs.  

“And then what?” Martinez asked as Chloe stepped up to the door and took in a deep breath, similar to how a miner would before releasing an airlock and praying they were not vacuumed into the void. 

“And then you shut up, look pretty, and wait for Chloe to handle the rest. That’s all you are needed for, you half-baked pineapple.” Rat smirked, slapping Martinez’s back hard enough to cause him to stumble on the ice. 

As Martinez recovered, he balled his fists and was full ready to clober Rat, his tentative ally or not, he was in no fucking mood to be throttled by anyone. Chloe noticed the boiling emotions of the corpsman and stepped between them, preventing this already sensitive situation from collapsing entirely.

Sure, she knew she had Martinez by the proverbial balls, but that in no way meant he was not Human. Emotions could, and likely would, overflow before the end of their tale together. 

“Alright, you two, calm down right now or I will rip up both of your deals.” Chloe threatened in a flat, matter-of-fact way. Her tone was unthreatening, calm, and controlled, yet it made her stance clear. Both would do what she wants, or what they wanted would no longer be a thing. 

Both warfighters grumbled, but let their issues die. They could deal with any problems they had later on. Now was not the time. Mouse or Blondie would be more than happy to oversee the pair, throttling the other and ensuring they worked out their issues like men, warriors, and two hot-blooded assholes who were more stubborn than mules. 

“Good, since neither of you want to argue. Can we at least make it through appetizers and a brief meet and greet? You two can burn each other at the stake at that point.” Chloe snarled, sounding more viscous than a First Sergeant without coffee and a lance corporal to smoke. 

Without waiting for either of them to respond, Chloe clipped about on her heels, stood tall, and walked forward. The doors parted without any of her effort, two soldiers on the inside of the foyer acting as automatic openers, actual blue grunt work right there. 

The inside of the mansion was just as opulent as the exterior; Dozens of statues with fountains acted as pillars holding up the massive gilded ceiling. 

The room was absolutely packed to the brim with patrons. Aliens of all sizes and shapes mingled with one another, eating snacks, chatting about greater astro-politics, and constantly attempting to one-up the other in a constant dick measuring contest. 

Each and every one of the attendees was doing their absolute best to prove why they were the best, worth more, or had more influence in the GU than the others. As Chloe and Martinez navigated the crowd to a location that only she knew, it became clear why many of these aliens had a claim to their jockeying position. 

Present tonight were oil moguls, members of royalty, and arms dealers involved in both illicit and legal trade. Martinez even overheard a Kurlatra woman, heavily augmented with cybernetics, mention her little sister and a Human she had married. They were allegedly responsible for preventing a coup of her mother, the empress, by her sister, and were considered living legends.

It was a shame that this mentioned Conor and Therilay were not in attendance. Martinez would like to speak to them about how they made their relationship work. God knew he needed some advice on how to navigate the intricacies of interspecies romance. It wasn’t like he had many people to ask. 

The hope to make contact with another Human all alone in the outerdark would have to wait until after Chloe had expended all the use she had of Martinez. For now, he had to focus and keep on task. And for damn good reason. 

While many of those around here paid him no real mind, the remainder eyed him up with suspicion. They either knew who he was from the galaxy-wide news reports, or knew precisely what the topper medal on his chest meant. 

Which one it was was virtually impossible to tell. Many nodded in respect, while others smiled and waved. A few even gave Martinez business cards, asking him to call, believing that Martinez was someone worth knowing. The only ones who made their stance known were those who approached him and asked about Lysa's whereabouts, ultimately to be disappointed when he informed them she was at home resting. 

Those few were particularly interested in Martinez and took down his contact information, and assured they would send any support that Martinez and Lysa needed pre or post birth; They claimed it was because they genuinely believed in what the GU did and that all species could coexist, but he was unsure of exactly how truthful they were being—he still had yet to learn the intricacies of body language for the tens of thousands of species in the GU. Most of these higher echelon sapients were well above him in typical station. 

Eventually, the group pushed out of the shifting crowds of people and turned down a small hallway where the vibe of the party changed completely. Rat stopped following the others and lingered near a window, positioning himself so he could see the hallway and the crowd with minimal distractions.

The only thing that made his job of keeping watch for any potential threats more difficult was a gaggle of Kurlatra women who took interest in him and swarmed like giddy girls would after a football star. 

Following Conor and Therilay's subjugation of their planet from rebellion ten standard years earlier, Humans had gained significant popularity among the species' youth. 

Each was hoping to find their very own lord of war, master of destiny, and man who could, as the rumors go, make their screams of pleasure heard for several kilometers. 

Before Chloe and Martinez were allowed entry into the guarded room at the end of the decadent hallway, the two guards, who were dressed as intensively as the ones in the front doors, stopped them. 

“Hold it, gotta search yah fer weapons,” The taller one growled, as the shorter Jurintik closed the distance. 

“You shall do no such thing!” Chloe roared, as Martinez was already readying to have the JKL, a pistol he considered an heirloom from Lysa’s side of his new family, confiscated for the time being. 

Martinez and the soldiers looked at her questioningly. Martinez, because the other Human never raised her voice. She was always cold and collected. She commanded respect and dominated every space she was in through candied words, social manipulation, and the ability ot bullshit her way out of anything. 

The soldiers seemed taken aback by her boldness. Chloe was comparatively puny to everyone present, the soldiers, wearing a hundred kilos of power armor, and holding 12-gauge shotguns, especially.

Martinez doubted they had ever had anyone give them guff or deny them. Their armor was shiny, new, and perfectly fitted. These two were no warriors. Much like the man who owned the house and was obsessed with warrior culture, they were acting a part; in no way were they the genuine article.

“This is Henry Martinez. Hero of Verilon, and the recipient of the Honor of Humanity. You should salute him and give this fine warrior the respect he deserves!” Chloe continued, stomping her foot and ensuring she was loud enough to be heard through the door. 

That had the desired effect. Before the soldiers could even recover from the tiny little chihuahua of a woman, someone had radioed to them, demanding that Martinez and Chloe be allowed in and that the soldiers do their job—keeping riffraff out, not his guests. 

“Alright, you are good to go,” the tall one said, stepping aside, while the short one opened the door.

“What was that?” Martinez asked. 

“The perfect start,” Chloe grinned like a wolf looking at an injured rabbit.

SO what did you all think of the chapter this week? I am sorry about the length. I wanted to do more, but my dads dogs have kept me occupied alot. Writing this week was a struggle 100%. but such is life. Next week we will meet this little wannabe warrior, and hopefully lead into what happened to Lysa and Mouse, spoiler it will not be a good day at the Martinez household. 

  
Please do not forget to follow me on twitter. Within the next month or so I will have a poll to decide what of three stories I should write next.

Her hand froze midair on the door handle.  
  
  
It was clearly her boyfriend's voice.  
  
  
She'd come here to tell him the good news, of course. But how has Liam already knew she was pregnant?  
  
  
Then a roar of laughter exploded inside the private room.  
  
  
""Liam, man, you really hit the jackpot this time! The Chandler princess is so into you, she's even carrying your baby! That means all the Chandler family's resources are basically yours, right?""  
  
  
Sophie peered through the narrow crack in the door.  
  
  
Liam sat with one leg crossed over the other, swirling a glass of wine, that smug face, one she'd loved for three years, looking impossibly pleased with himself.  
  
  
""Please. The kid's not even mine.""  
  
  
A slow, mocking smile crept across his lips. ""I never touched her.""  
  
  
Sophie's mind went blank. Her whole body turned cold.  
  
  
""What?! Then who's the father?!"" Jake's voice cracked with shock.  
  
  
""How would I know?"" Liam spun his Macallan lazily, voice light as air. ""She probably just found some random guy at the Hamptons. She's dumb enough to believe whatever you tell her. As long as she thinks it's mine, it's all good. Even if Mr. Chandler hates my guts, now he has no choice but to hand her over.""  
  
  
""Once we're married, my place in the Morgan family is set.""  
  
  
She clenched the doorknob so hard her knuckles turned bone white.  
  
  
""Damn, Liam, that's one hell of a hustle,"" said the Goldman Sachs guy, smirking. ""Aren't you worried she'll figure it out someday?""  
  
  
""Worried?"" Liam let out a laugh. ""She's a total pushover. I could tell her our Met Gala meeting was fate and she'd believe it. And even if she does catch on, so what? We'll be married by then. What can she even do?""  
  
  
Another wave of laughter followed, glasses clinking in celebration like they'd already won some big game.  
  
  
Outside the door, Sophie felt the whole world tilt.  
  
  
She'd only gotten the positive test from her Upper East Side gynecologist a week ago. Her plan had been to surprise him on his birthday with the news.  
  
  
She'd imagined the moment a hundred times, how thrilled he'd be, how he'd pull her into his arms with tears in his eyes, promising her forever.  
  
  
But what she got instead was an even bigger surprise.  
  
  
The baby wasn't his.  
  
  
Then whose child was she carrying?  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""That dumb bitch Sophie? All money, no brains. I've had enough of her.""  
  
  
Sophie stopped breathing.  
  
  
""Once I drain the Chandler family's cash after we're married, the first thing I'll do is kick her to the curb.""  
  
  
The words hit her like ice water. Three years, and this was what he really thought of her.  
  
  
Laughter erupted from the room. ""Damn, Liam, you're cold! But smart. Why work when you can marry into money?""  
  
  
""She makes it so easy,"" Liam's voice carried through the door, dripping with contempt. ""Desperate little princess, fighting mommy and daddy for me. I just have to smile and she hands over everything.""  
  
  
Sophie's knees nearly gave out. The hallway felt suffocating, the expensive cologne and smoke choking her.  
  
  
She couldn't listen anymore.  
  
  
Sophie walked to her car in a daze. Three years of fighting her parents for him. Three years of believing he loved her. She'd starved herself when they disapproved. Cried herself to sleep. Nearly destroyed her relationship with her family.  
  
  
All for a man who called her a desperate little princess.  
  
  
All lies.  
  
  
She sat in the driver's seat, hand on her stomach. The baby wasn't even his. Then whose was it? That night two months ago was still a blur of alcohol and fragmented memories.  
  
  
Her phone buzzed.  
  
  
A text from Liam.  
  
  
\[Hey babe, where are you? Thought you were coming over?\]  
  
  
She stared at the screen, her heart going colder by the second. Even now, he was performing. The caring boyfriend act, when minutes ago he'd been calling her a desperate little princess.  
  
  
The drive home passed in a blur. By the time she pulled into the driveway, darkness had fallen over the villa.  
  
  
The house felt empty, silent. Sophie curled up on the couch, replaying every moment of their relationship. Had there ever been anything real? Any genuine feeling from his side?  
  
  
Her parents had been right all along. Liam was from a side branch of the Morgans—ambitious but powerless. And she'd been his ticket to the top.  
  
  
Footsteps approached the front door.  
  
  
Liam walked in, wearing his signature gentle smile.  
  
  
""There you are, sweetheart. Where did you disappear to?"" He placed a takeout bag on the coffee table. ""Got your favorite from that place you love. Parking was a nightmare.""  
  
  
What an act.  
  
  
She stared at him, numb.  
  
  
""Hey, you alright? You look rough."" He reached for her forehead, worry creasing his brow. ""Are you running a fever? You shouldn't be driving around if you're not feeling well.""  
  
  
She turned her head away. ""I'm fine.""  
  
  
""You sure? You seem off."" His concern sounded so genuine. How had she never seen through this act? ""Maybe you should rest. I can stay the night, take care of you.""  
  
  
""You said you had a surprise for me. What is it?"" Liam's eyes lit up with anticipation, leaning forward slightly.  
  
  
Sophie met his gaze.  
  
  
She could see the calculation in his eyes. He was waiting for pregnancy news that would seal his future.  
  
  
""My family just landed a major business deal. Big numbers.""  
  
  
The light in his eyes died instantly. His smile faltered for just a moment before snapping back into place. ""That's... that's great news, baby.""  
  
  
She watched him try to hide his disappointment. He'd been expecting something else. Something about the baby he somehow already knew about.  
  
  
""Isn't that worth celebrating?"" she said quietly.  
  
  
""Of course! Hell yeah!"" He scrambled to recover, gesturing at the takeout. ""This calls for champagne. Well, maybe sparkling cider for you since you..."" He caught himself. ""Since you look a bit under the weather.""  
  
  
Nice save. But she'd caught it.  
  
  
""I just thought maybe you were going to say your family had finally agreed to the wedding.""  
  
  
Sophie watched him fake his way through it. Three years of falling for his bullshit. Three years of being his ""desperate little princess.""  
  
  
But that Sophie was gone.  
  
  
She smiled—a real smile this time, though not for the reasons he'd think.  
  
  
""Don't worry,"" she said softly. ""I have plenty more surprises coming.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Late at night, alone in bed, Sophie couldn't close her eyes without seeing that hazy figure again.  
  
  
The baby wasn't Liam's.  
  
  
Then who was that man that night?  
  
  
She had to find out, fast.  
  
  
The next morning, she headed straight for the hotel.  
  
  
""I'm so sorry, Ms. Chandler,"" the hotel manager said, full of regret. ""There was a system failure that day. All the surveillance footage was lost.""  
  
  
""Really? Of all days, it had to be that one?""  
  
  
The manager's eyes darted away, his voice lacking confidence. ""It was truly an accident. We're deeply sorry…""  
  
  
Sophie let out a cold laugh and turned to leave.  
  
  
The hotel belonged to the Morgans. If Liam wanted something erased, all he had to do was lift a finger.  
  
  
Still, no matter what, she was going to find out who the father was.  
  
  
She clenched her fists, eyes filled with a stubborn, burning resolve.  
  
  
3 p.m., at the convention center.  
  
  
She sat beside her father, her thoughts stuck on the hotel footage. She couldn't focus on the auction at all.  
  
  
""Sophie, that's Marcus Morgan.""  
  
  
Her father leaned in to whisper in her ear.  
  
  
She blinked, snapping back to the moment. Her gaze drifted toward the entrance, where a man was walking in, surrounded by a crowd.  
  
  
Sharp, chiseled features. An air of power and distance clung to him with every move he made.  
  
  
Marcus.  
  
  
Liam's uncle.  
  
  
The real head of the Morgan family.  
  
  
The man holding the lifeline of Riverland's entire economy.  
  
  
She'd heard rumors, Marcus was ruthless and decisive. Every time Liam caught wind of him nearby, he'd grab her hand and take a detour.  
  
  
""If we can strike a deal with the Morgans,"" her father murmured with awe, ""our family will be untouchable in Riverland.""  
  
  
Sophie gave a distracted nod and looked away again.  
  
  
""Next up, bidding begins for the prime land in West River! Starting price: Two hundred million!""

**Other**
Suspected abandoned vehicle. It’s a white Chevrolet Express Van, license plate 112 VEF Fayette county. We first moved into our house on August 1st, and since then, the van has been in the exact same spot up to now (August 20th). It’s not obstructing our driveway, but is in front of our yard and inconveniently close to the driveway. It does not seem to belong to any of the neighbors, as all of them have plenty space in front of their residences. We’ve been watching for activity, but we haven’t seen anything. If it is not actually abandoned, any resources we could use to contact the owner about it would be much appreciated, as we have four cars that need to park here. We don’t want to cause issues with other residents but it has gotten to the point where it’s clear no one is tending to it.

This helped me find purpose and changed how I see everything.

Flow state is where life actually happens. When you're completely absorbed in something you love, time disappears. Started paying attention to when I naturally enter flow and realized that's when I feel most alive and connected to something bigger.

The universe operates on patience, not urgency. Everything in nature grows slowly trees, relationships, wisdom. I was trying to force major life changes overnight and burning out. Learn to work with natural rhythms instead of against them.

Boredom is your brain's way of processing life. Used to panic whenever I felt unstimulated and would immediately grab my phone. Now I sit with boredom and let my mind wander. That's when the best ideas come when you're not forcing anything.

Your ikigai isn't always your job. Spent years thinking I had to monetize everything I enjoyed. Sometimes your purpose is being a good friend, creating art no one sees, or just bringing calm energy to chaotic situations. It's simply learning how to live in the present moment.

Small, consistent actions create meaning. Instead of looking for one big purpose, I started noticing tiny things that brought me joy like making coffee mindfully, really listening to people, taking care of plants. Purpose isn't always profound.

Community and connection are non-negotiable. The loneliness epidemic is real. Started prioritizing relationships over achievements and everything felt more meaningful. We're literally wired for connection. We are social animals after all.

Accepting impermanence reduces anxiety. Everything changes, including your problems and your current situation. This used to terrify me, now it's oddly comforting. Bad phases pass, but so do good ones - so you appreciate both more.

The book reads like a gentle conversation rather than a self-help manual. It reminded me that meaning isn't something you find ""out there"" it emerges from how you engage with whatever's in front of you.

Anyone else feel like they're constantly searching for their ""thing""? Sometimes I think we overcomplicate it.",6,1755774810.0,ZenHabits,1,0.88,False
1mw7zk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/resinprinting/comments/1mw7zk9/cleaning_ipa_with_coffee_filters/,Cleaning IPA with coffee filters?,"When I first got a resin printer, the advice I got was to clean out my IPA wash fluid by running it through a coffee filter/cone.

However, every time I try this, it proves to be \*painfully\* slow - like one drip every several seconds, which takes days to filter even just a couple of litres of IPA, and finding somewhere for it to safely sit for several days is a big problem.

I presume these filters must be faster than this when straining coffee (it's not something I drink), so I'm really quite at a loss as to why they seem to be so impermeable to IPA (an IPA molecule being much smaller than key molecules in coffee).

Is there a specific variety of filter I need to be looking for (or, inversely, avoiding)?

EDIT: I will note that I've already let the fluid sit in the sun and have siphoned it off leaving behind the bulk of the resin sediment, so there's few large chunks in it, but what's left behind is still somewhat murky and would benefit from being cleaner.",1,1755774804.0,resinprinting,4,1.0,False

My mom is a big coffee lover, but her routine is super simple. Every morning she warms up about 200ml of milk in the microwave and adds two spoons of Nescafe Gold. For 20+ years she has been doing this religiously every day and really enjoys it.

I’d love to get her a gift (around a $100 budget) that she can use every day to make her routine easier, tastier, or just an overall upgrade. I don’t know much about coffee, which is why I’m here asking for recommendations. I want to get her something she’ll actually use daily, not something that ends up in a cupboard.

ARM & HAMMER 033200003427 was a product I didn’t realize I’d need so much until I tried it. Life tends to toss a few surprise stains my way, from the splatter of spaghetti sauce to those mysterious marks my dog Daisy seems to magically create on our throw blankets. I decided to put this concentrated laundry detergent through the ultimate household gauntlet to see if it lived up to its claim of being tough on stains yet gentle on sensitive skin. Spoiler alert: it’s pretty impressive, but there are definitely some quirks that stand out.

**Ease-of-Use Convenience**

Convenience is key when juggling family life and household chores. These pre-measured Power Paks make life simple—no fussing with measuring cups or accidental spills of liquid detergent all over the washing machine. Tossing one into the drum feels like a small victory in every laundry load. Got extra-messy clothes? Just pop in two paks, and you’re golden. Not having to think too much about measurements is a small but much-appreciated luxury. Even my teenager, who’s never exactly thrilled about chores, found the straightforward process idiot-proof.

**Strengths**

- Effortless to use thanks to pre-measured paks  
- Free of dyes, perfumes, and other potential irritants  
- Excellent stain removal, even on tough, ground-in messes  
- Compatible with cold water and high-efficiency machines  

**Dermatologist-Tested Formula**

For someone in the family with sensitive skin (hello, me), this detergent feels like a safe choice. I’ve always been wary of bold detergents that claim stain-fighting abilities because they often come with strong fragrances or chemicals that irritate. This one, however, is as skin-kind as it gets. It’s dermatologist-tested and also SkinSAFE certified, which means families dealing with allergies might want to check it out. 

Not once did I notice a rash or itching after using it for several weeks on everything from bed sheets to gym clothes. Even baby clothes came out soft and irritation-free. Big victory for moms or anyone dealing with eczema-prone skin!

**Performance That Surprises**

Let me break it down. This detergent boasts 4X the stain-fighting power of leading value options, and while I can’t scientifically test that claim, I can say the results don’t lie. Coffee spills, grass-stained jeans, and a smoothie accident on my favorite couch throw—gone. ARM & HAMMER’s pH Power Technology dives deeper into fabric fibers than most competitors, breaking stains apart rather than masking them. 

When testing, I even ran a load on eco-cold settings to see how it handled a minimal energy wash. Success! Everything came out clean without any dreaded detergent residue that other products sometimes leave behind.

**Weaknesses**

- Not entirely biodegradable packaging, which could deter the eco-conscious  
- The seal on the resealable bag doesn't always close as securely as expected  
- Struggles a bit with extremely heavy-duty grease stains without pre-treatment  

**Sustainability and Why It Matters**

This is where I ended up having mixed feelings. The product claims to use 100 percent renewable electricity during its production. This is great—as someone who likes leaning into eco-friendly habits, seeing this commitment to sustainability is a win. However, the resealable zip bag might raise an eyebrow among those who want fully biodegradable or recyclable packaging. While the detergent inside is stellar, ARM & HAMMER could take steps to improve its packaging to draw in the environmentally conscious crowd a bit more.

**Product Comparisons**

When looking at competitors, plenty of options come to mind, like Tide Pods and Seventh Generation Free & Clear packs. Tide often kills it with cleaning power, but it frequently includes strong scents, which isn’t ideal for sensitive skin. On the other end, Seventh Generation is a strong player in the all-natural and sustainable game, but ARM & HAMMER 033200003427 still stands out with its superior stain-fighting toughness. 

That said, Seventh Generation one-ups this product with its eco-friendly packaging. If sustainability is a deal breaker, you might lean toward their offering, though you might sacrifice a bit of the deep-clean performance ARM & HAMMER delivers.

**True Value**

Considering how much this detergent can handle—from regular laundry to disastrous spills—you get what you pay for. Even if it might sit slightly above the budget aisle prices, the time saved re-washing or endlessly scrubbing stains unarguably makes it worth it.  

It’s also worth noting its versatility. Whether washing colors, whites, or delicates on cold wash cycles, performance remains consistent. That sort of reliability means you’re not stuck buying separate detergents for different purposes—a pretty great balance when evaluating cost efficiency.

[€1000],"I am looking for our first espresso machine. I started researching with the assumption that we could use our fellow ode grinder for espresso. At that time, i found that the Bambino Plus looked like a great candidate. However, now that i see that the fellow ode grinder cannot be used for espresso, i'm looking for ""everything"". I'm open to both separate machine+grinder and machine with integrated grinder.  
I am looking for a machine with some programmability/customization, so i can tune it to my desire. Other than that i am looking for reliability, something that just works.

I want to imagine that i'll be a tinkerer like you guys, buying all kinds of beans, roasts, additional equipment, researching times, shots, results and so forth, but if i am realistic, i'm not going to do that. I just need something that makes me a great cup of coffee every time.

We've had a capsule machine for about 2 years with no concerns towards quality of coffee. About 6 months ago i invested in a Hario V60 dripper and a Fellow Ode (can't remember if it's a gen1 or gen2, but it has the SSP burrs) for pour over coffee. I'm already growing tired of the manual process and the about 5 whole minutes it takes to make a cup of coffee. I need something more... automatic.

We have a fairly small kitchen with not much space on the countertop, however the right machine is more important than a small machine. I highly prioritize silence and hate loud noises, especially in the morning.

I have limited experience with espresso, but my partner has some experience and we have a barista in the family.

Our preferred drink types are espresso, americanos and milk-based drinks. We usually drink 1 cup each, every day. We rarely have guests.

I am from Denmark, in the EU. I am looking for recommendations for machines, that i can look for, used, refurbished or on sale.

Candidates: The barista in my family has a Sage/Breville Barista Pro and swears to Sage machines. I think those machines look great. I've been researching several of those, but there are also a lot of complaints in the posts on this subreddit. I just don't want to buy something i'll regret. When my Fellow Ode grinder was still in consideration, i almost jumped on the Bambino Plus. I also saw a relatively cheap Barista Pro that i thought about buying, until i read somewhere that the build quality is.. improveable, and the grinder could also be improved.

I don't know much about the abbreviations you guys use, so i would appreciate if you could not use them and instead write out the whole words, so i can research them. Thank you all very much for all your help.",1,1755774651.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

Everything around me reminds me of you- whenever I open my eyes and you're not there, whenever I prepare my coffee just how you like it, whenever I hear my phone ring and receive notifications, I wish it was you. I remember you when I prepare for work because for two years, whenever I moisturize and do my skincare, we'd be facetiming. I remember you whenever I go for lunch because you always send me reminders during lunch time.

It's been hard. So hard. You've been a part of my life for the past two years and when routine suddenly comes to a halt, it is like me going for scuba diving and then suddenly, my tank stopped working. It's hard to eat. I force myself to have a least a decent meal once a day cause I don't want to be sick. It's very difficult to sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and end up crying cause I remember how happy we were. How carefree we were, until we have to give up on each other because of consequences and choices that was both imposed to us.

How do I say goodbye and let go of the man who has been my anchor, my home, my happy place? It was different with you. I've been alone for 5 yrs and when you came, everything became beautiful. You took care of me, treasured me, loved me. IDK how to live my life without you.

I wonder how are you doing. Do you eat on time? Do you drink enough water for the day? Do you miss me? Do you miss the way I send my good morning love messages everyday? Do you think of me in random timings of the day and wish it was me you've chosen? Do you feel pain in your heart when you realize you've lost me?

You told me that you were the happiest while you were with me, that I am your happy place too.

I hope you're doing well. I miss you and I love you.

The first time, I ordered a latte with oat milk because I can’t have dairy (it causes me a lot of pain). He gave me regular milk instead. I didn’t say anything that time because mistakes happen, and I just threw it out.

The second time, I was extra clear about ordering a vanilla latte with oat milk. He gave me regular milk again. When I asked him if it was oat milk, he insisted it was. But when I tasted it, I could tell immediately it wasn’t. I politely asked him to remake it, and while he did, he left out the vanilla syrup completely. I’ve had this drink before, so I know how it’s supposed to taste.

When I brought it back again and told him, all he said was, “oh that’s weird,” then took the drink back. I don’t even know if he actually fixed it because it still tasted like plain coffee with oat milk, no vanilla at all.

At this point, I feel like he just doesn’t want to serve me properly. I don’t even know him, but it honestly feels personal. From now on, I’m going to wait for other staff instead of letting him take my order.",1,1755774131.0,u_LawAccurate5917,0,1.0,False

1mw7qsi,https://i.redd.it/bdsdwfqprckf1.png,Kitchen Table Conversations: Foxtrot & Russo plot the future (Between the Cathedral and the Dungeon),"**TL;DR:** 

After last season’s unlikely quadruple with Fiorentina, Owl Foxtrot and Ángel Russo spend a late night at the kitchen table sketching futures. Cathedrals in Spain, dungeons in Romania, experiments in the MLS or South East Asia. A manifesto is written that will underpin whatever comes next. No loanees, no over-32s, academy first, forgotten talents revived. Whether it ends in exile or triumph, the Foxtrot-Russo doctrine is coming with them.

[**FULL TEXT:**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D4pYq1vdoB1-hZ3LDZucBVNUIZs_Z0tPv2opNCKJjCU/edit?usp=sharing)

It starts, as these things always do, with too much caffeine for Owl, and too much brandy for Ángel.

A roll-up caught at the corner of Ángel’s lips, curling its ash downwards, towards Owl’s pocked and scarred kitchen table. The house is still, the city quieter than usual. Somewhere across the Arno, fireworks crackle but not for Fiorentina, not for us, just for summer itself.

It’s late, and we’re unwinding after a long day at Viola Park. We are still at the kitchen table, still scheming. The fixture list for the season ahead is open to one side, a notebook of scouting reports on the other. There is also a growing sense that all of this could end badly. Since winning the quadruple I made the decision to make some changes. Some might say too many. Ángel and I have written a doctrine, a manifesto, of how we are going to do things here and now and likely in the future.

Ángel drops into the chair opposite, exhales like an old accordion, and grins. “Hermano, we are going to get fired.”

He says it like a toast to the future. Raised glass, and all.

Maybe he’s right. The scale of last season’s success just wasn’t supposed to happen. The guys from Madrid coming in and taking over the club wasn’t supposed to happen. Our manifesto made its way to the boardroom, and promises about age cut-offs, loanees and the academy pipeline were made. Those weren’t supposed to be tested in public quite so soon. But, here we are. Another night at the kitchen table, another season stretching out in front of us, the future drifting inexorably into harder focus as the seconds tick by on the clock.

That is where the conversation turns this evening. Not toward Florence, not the season ahead. But beyond. To the next stop. To the possibility that we’ll be out of here in a year’s time.

The conversation starts with Spain. Spain comes up first, because it always does when we’ve joked and chatted amiably about where we go next. The country’s footballing culture lends itself to building something from nothing, of taking a good club and turning it into a contender for the crown. There are cathedrals waiting in Galicia, in Bilbao and in La Coruña. It would be a long term project, five years to catch up to Real and Barca and a few more to solidify whoever we end up with into perennial contenders for the title and the cup.

Ángel leans forward, eyes gleaming. “If we build up one of those clubs, hermano… it will outlive us both. Like Sagrada Família, we would just be the first architects. We would start it, but really we would never finish. We’d be laying the foundations, and laying the first bricks.”

Gaudi’s cathedral isn’t finished, and maybe never will be. The clubs we’re looking at in Spain don’t even know that architects are looking to build stories around them. But, we remind ourselves, right now we’re still laying the foundation in Florence, and it feels fragile with our pivot away from 4-3-21 to 3-4-3 and a move away from foreign stars.

From Spain, the conversation takes a different turn. An idea forming as I think and speak.

What if we leave the cathedral to others, for now? What if, after Florence, we spend two seasons in the dungeon instead? Defensive football, catenaccio’s bastard children, the game played in shackles. Why not look to clubs in Greece, Ukraine, Romania or even further afield? We go there and we find concrete stadiums, hard men and football reduced to survival. Low blocks and defensive masterclasses, strangling opponents into boredom and likely absorbing the ire of the board and the fans as we squeeze the joy from the game.

Ángel doesn’t flinch. He just nods, like it makes sense. “To know the cathedral, you must also know the dungeon. One without the other is half a faith.”

He’s right. You can’t understand beauty without ugliness. You can’t understand creation without discipline. If we’re going to continue developing, and finding new angles, then maybe we have to spend a season in black coats, slogging our way through 0-0s until a header wins it in the 88th minute. An experiment, a deliberate heel turn from the free-flowing, attacking style we’ve become renowned for, and accustomed to. Maybe, just maybe, we find a laboratory project for the dark arts.

The conversation continues but Ángel is restless. He gets up and half floats, half stumbles to the balcony. He returns a while later smelling as though he’s been for a coffee break in Amsterdam. He’s had twenty minutes to himself and wants to offer his thoughts on other projects that could be interesting, other places we could go. 

Portugal: Braga, the eternal bridesmaid, waiting to break the trinity of Porto, Benfica, Sporting.

Serbia: A complete unknown in terms of tactics and structure, but tempting because of the fan culture and heritage. A blank page, six or seven seasons of slow-burn, taking a continental nobody into European relevance.

The Netherlands: Groningen, perhaps, appealing considering it was a job offer that didn’t materialise after I left Stevenage. Intriguing options elsewhere too with the possibility of building a fourth power to compete with PSV, Feyenoord and Ajax.

MLS: Philadelphia’s working-class fight, the city of brotherly love. Continental champions in waiting? Learning the machinations of a set-up closer to the NBA than the Premier League - very, very interesting…

South East Asia: Malaysia or Thailand. Names more exotic to me than any Champions League group. Places where football is pure mystery. Very much a new frontier with games played in the baking sun and 60,000 fans for derbies I’ve never heard of. Very intriguing.

Each of the options we discuss is seductive in its own way. Each of them feel like they could become home, for a while at least. 

One thing is certain: the manifesto we’ve settled on won’t stay behind in Florence. Wherever we go, it comes with us. Yes, it may need some adjustments depending on where we eventually land, but the core is simple.

* No loanees…unless they are absolute starters with options to buy.
* No players over 32. We sell them, release them, or turn them into coaches.
* Academy first! Plug holes with youth, not panic buys.
* Build a cultural spine. So far at Fiorentina this consists of Poles and Serbs at the back, and Italians up front.
* Give second chances. We buy the forgotten, the discarded, the undervalued.
* No 4-3-2-1. It’s too easy.

Florence is the starting point, it has been tested under fire for a few months. The season ahead will see it succeed or likely see us fired. If we are fired, we will take the manifesto into exile and find another proving and testing ground.

Ángel raises his glass, the brandy catching the lamplight. “Peace and blessings, hermano. If it all burns to the ground this season, may it burn wildy! If we build a castle on the foundation this season, may it stand for a long time!”

I laugh, because right then I realise that whether it’s cathedrals or dungeons, Portugal or Serbia, success or the sack, this thing is ours. Our project. Our doctrine. Our pilgrimage. When we do leave or get booted from Florence, the expectation will be for me to take a big job, in a top 5 league. But damn the expectation, we go our own way. A long-term cathedral build, or a short stint in the dungeon - when the time comes the job market decides the club. If the club speaks to me, then we go there.



Wherever we go next, I know they won’t be expecting us, and they had better be ready.

There are very valid reasons for sometimes having to put stuff in a storage unit such as in the middle of a move or life instability or using it as backstock for your business. But it’s crazy to me that some people just have stuff in storage as overflow from their house. My dad has two storage units full of junk. He buys things impulsively and then doesn’t use them and then sticks them in storage. Things like folding bikes, mini fridges, coffee makers, etc. When I say someone might want them he says it’s too much of a hassle to sell them. Ok? Give them away. There are people far less fortunate than him who could really benefit from a free bike or coffee maker. Why let it just sit in storage for the chain to rust until you eventually throw it away? 

It makes me sad to know that there are people who could really use chairs or a table or something that is just sitting in storage unused. ",16,1755773871.0,Anticonsumption,9,0.94,False

So, I have this neighbor in my apartments. He’s the nicest old man ever. I would place him in his mid to late 70s. He’s healthy enough and mentally stable enough to not need to be in a nursing home, though. However, he has absolutely no one in his life. No one visits, he doesn’t talk to anyone, and he has absolutely nothing in his apartment. He’s also a military veteran, as am I, which is one reason why me and him hit it off and started getting along. I’ll sit on his patio sometimes and chat with him. Even if I’m in my 30’s and he’s 40 years my senior…we have built a solid friendship filled with morning coffee and military banter.

I don’t know his whole backstory or where his kids are, or if he even has any. I just know that his wife passed away last year and for some unknown reason this man has nothing to his name. I’m not sure if it was because of hardship or what, but his car is pretty much broken down. All he has in his apartment is a foldable like lawn chair, a twin mattress on the ground, and a little 32 inch TV. He’s never told me why he doesn’t have anything, but did say he can’t afford it and that his income (assuming mostly just Social Security) is only enough to pay for rent, a little bit of food, and a few bucks in his gas tank every month. I know that he doesn’t have anyone else because he’s here on the holidays, and no one comes to visit. Plus he’s said something about not seeing family. We started chatting on our patios together or having our our coffee together. Once I saw how kind this man was, and how he was living, I immediately had an an idea.

I want to help make him a home. I told myself that somehow I would save up, work extra shifts, or get donations in order to surprise him. Have him an apartment full of furniture (it’s a tiny 500SF studio apartment might I add). I’ve got a bed frame, mattress, loveseat, coffee table, kitchen table, TV stand, and a dresser picked out online. Found some great deals and didn’t cost much at all for all that. Also, a 50” TV and a $250 grocery Walmart gift card. I do realize that I could easily go to Goodwill or Facebook marketplace or craigslist and find all this stuff for probably $500, but it’s gonna be old. It’s gonna stink, and he doesn’t deserve that. I think the joy of having something brand new that no one‘s ever owned before would just be awesome. So, here goes.

How much do I need? Well. I’m personally contributing $800 from my savings. I can’t do any more than that. All the items come out to around $1670. Since I can only put forth $800, my donation raising goal is just the other $870 left. Truly grateful for anything that anyone can give. Also, I have pics of everything I’ve saved online that he will be getting.

I know this is completely random. But sometimes people just need to be reminded that their not alone in this world. This guy‘s name is Ralph. Like I said. He’s a vet. He’s such a genuine dude. His wife recently passed away. He doesn’t have kids that come around at all he’s completely alone. Imagine that. So. One way or another, I’m going to get this done. Then, I’m going to get it all delivered (free delivery), and will be here the day that they come to set it up. Please help me accomplish this goal of mine.

One day in the canteen, while I was sprinkling masala on pakoras, she came up to me and cracked a random joke:
“Yeh coffee powder toh nahi hai? Once we actually sprinkled coffee powder on pakoras by mistake.”

It was such a lame yet oddly cute joke, and I couldn’t help but feel maybe she was interested. As she approached khudse and which girl approaches to start a convo in the ECONOMY???But then, I’ve also heard from colleagues that she makes eye contact with almost every guy, so I keep doubting myself.

“Coffee powder chahiye?”

She just smiled and left. Now I’m stuck wondering

As a child, there were a few occasions when I would wake up feeling completely enchanted, as if I had been up for hours and wasn't even sleepy.

We had daylight savings time a few months ago, and I made a mistake setting my alarm. I felt fantastic when I naturally woke up. I felt as though I had slept for years after getting that extra hour. I had no inclination to return to sleep or even the slightest sense of grogginess. It was truly a weird but great experience that I’d imagine a lot of people feel when they’ve had a perfect nights sleep.

I’ve tried going to be an hour earlier or getting up a bit later and can never seem to get this quality of sleep again. After breakfast, I take supps like ashwagandha ksm 66, l theanine and moda from ndepot, highstreetpharma and sportsresearch.

One day I using a machine at the gym that involves pushing up while your sitting and I still remember the sound 🥶 my shoulder made this awful crunchy sound and it hurt, thought maybe a pulled a muscle so I waited..and waited.. and it never fully left. Everytime I tried to start working my arms again in anyway I’ve tried atleast it burns horribly, I sanded a bench this week and I could barely hold my arm up to pour my coffee the following day. I’ve done physical therapy 5 times since this surgery and I’m really dreading having to do it again (not that they’ve called me back anyways I’ve called 3 times). PLEASE any advice? It’s really thrown me off I have a pretty physical job, I can’t even carry my 1 year old in my right arm anymore or pick him up without pain. I’ve dreaded working out since and have gained much of the weight back.

Little backstory.

I write erotic literature instead of watching porn. Some of it’s from a subs perspective and I heavily masturbate while writing… which I also do when writing from the dom perspective. In fact, I only write/refine while I’m masturbating because that’s when I feel inspired lmao. I fully immerse myself into the mindset of whoever my narrator is. Then when I’m in the same mood, I go back and read stuff I wrote for round 2. No, you can’t read it. 

The thing is in most real situations, I feel like I’m playing sub while observing and analysing thinking “yeah you don’t know what you’re doing with me, do you?”It always goes something like

Just have confidence. You’ve got it. Fuck that’s hot. Anything, you’re in charge. I’m your slut. You don’t need to ask me that. You’re so cute. Mhm. Want me to show you? Yeah? Like this. Got it? You like that? Get on your fucking knees then-

Then my brain is like wait a sec… eh whatever this is fun too. I haven’t fully subbed for anyone since my situationship of 2021. Then a few days ago, when I was reading back my writing, I thought fuck it. My first send was a silent coffee send to a domme I liked and that tipped me over the edge for sure. I don’t think it feels AS good as receiving sends, but it felt good enough to be triggering.

The main issue is most appear to get a bit intimidated by my confidence, and some end up subbing for me. In their defence, I have been told I have bratty, borderline domme energy even as a sub💀 But 2021 kept me in my place so it’s possible. That was the epitome of subspace. Also, I know how D/S dynamics work at its core.

Anyways, that’s me. I’m not sure where I belong in all this. But it’d be cool to join you guys and explore my submissive side. We’ll see :)

She called me on phone and said that i tried hard for promotion and u should have been thankful to me instead you are unhappy 
Than the discussion came to such that she asked in a rude way that what type of work have u done that you are expecting y hike 
She kept on increasing the tone and pitch of what she was saying that i am trying to explain you that hike is not possible than i said may be in future year end but she said you are such dumb that you aren’t understanding a thing
My view point here is i absolutely got it what she was trying to make me understand however i was expecting a good hike on promotion (this she not getting) and than labelling what good things you have done to ask for more hike

I said let’s talk tomorrow maybe because we both aren’t understanding each other view point and yiu are talking rudely

Now current situation she has stopped talking to me i say hi she ignores we go with other colleagues for coffee she leaves when i m present and isn’t not engaging with me in any conversation (non work)
Work wise she has started highlighting my minute mistakes is stricter than ever and raises questions on everything i do or miss 

Had a chat with another colleague she told me that manager told her that i (manager) had asked senior manager for my promotion but she is ungrateful and unhappy and she hasn’t thanked me and god knows what else she has told other employees 

I am not getting how to deal with this. Offcourse she is right she might have helped for my promotion but i have done work entire years to have me promoted . After listening and handling her behaviour all these years my self respect is not allowing me to go to her and say thankyou all i was expecting as an employee that if i asks for y hike if that’s not possible you can tell employe no this is not possible let’s look for an alternative but humiliating a employee just because he she asked for a good hike isn’t something supposed to be done
Now if i don’t do good terms with her i know i am doomed every sibgle day will be tourtue

Tldr -manager was rude i said directly that yiu are being rude her behaviour changed and is not pointing me at slightest of things

Seeking clarity on a very recent breakup after (only) three but very intense months. Sorry it's quite long but I'm trying to be impartial. We're two women in our early 30s (sexuality isn't an issue for any of us).

I met her through common friends, we shared looks and chatted, then texted a bit here and there for weeks. Met up for an evening and then coffee nothing more because we live in different cities. In May we decided to meet up for a short trip together (5 days). We got physically, emotionally and intellectually very close but without any verbal or sexual commitment yet, trying to not take things too quickly. We voiced concerns about the distance, about her burnout, about attachment patterns and possible issues. She said she was avoidant, aware and working on it, and that in her last relationship she wasn't as much as before. I said I had anxious tendencies in the past but was really secure now, even if I tend to feel/commit faster than average. We also checked long-time compatibility and learned what makes the other feel comfortable or safe, or what could be a trigger. 

It felt amazing. On the last evening she said she wasn't sure nor ready to commit because of burnout issue, she wanted time to herself to focus on getting back to work. I said I felt confident and could wait, that I thought it made sense and wanted her to set her priorities straight. On the way back, I thought ""she might be the one"". For context, I'll add that I very rarely fall for someone, it's happened only once in the last decade and it was much more casual. I have never, even in past intense relationships, felt so certain about someone. I wasn't in a rush because I felt it would all just happen organically, that time wasn't a problem and that I could wait without anxiety.

We texted more afterwards, with the same vibe as the trip. We weren't tied, it was all about discovering the other and exploring compatibility further, then we started texting much, much more, dropping the ""ifs"" to engage more into heavy flirt and sexting. After a few weeks we spent at least an hour on the phone everyday, talking about anything and everything. A month after our trip, I was away for three days (no signal), she had a party with lots of alcohol and slept with a random guy. The day after I received the most heartfelt and loving text ever, she was a mess, afraid she'd ruined everything before it even started, apologized profusely, asked to talk things through. We did. I didn't feel jealous, I know she has a high sex-drive, the sexting had me on overdrive too and we weren't officially tied. That single text was enough for me to process it, the honesty, guilt and willingness to make amends for us to work was all I needed and I still think that now, even after the breakup.

So, summer couldn't come quick enough, but we joked that it was probably better to have to wait. I had rented something for July, she met me there the very day I arrived and stayed almost three weeks. All perfect, the real beginning of our relationship, including physical intimacy and lots of shared activities and the small things of daily life. We talked about the future, mostly in light ways, half-jokes, varying from weekends together in Autumn to sharing thoughts about what we'd like our lives to look like in 10 years. With her, I bought tickets to visit her in September. She brought me to her parents' home for two days, we had fun and it was all smooth.

By the end of the third week, she voiced concerns about energy and time issues, as she hadn't been able to go back to work as planned (not her fault) and hadn't found anything else yet. I said we didn't have to rush and she could take more time than initially planned at her parents, coming back to me later that month. Mid-July, wedding together (mutual friends), spent most of our free time together, half hidden at first and then kissing in the open. It was super romantic and an amazing weekend. We spent a bit over a week apart afterwards, then she invited me to her parents' again (main reason was she's exhausted by changing places too often), and after 4-5 days we spent another 4 days at my rental place. That last week was a bit more difficult as the stress of getting back to work took over her and she was less into physical intimacy. We had two very serious conversations about what we should do. She suggested to take a break of a few months, for her to sort things through, but without cutting contact. I said I couldn't be put on hold like that, that I'd probably just wait anxiously to know what would happen, but that maybe we could try to give ourselves more space in the coming weeks, to keep things lighter and have her focus on herself, and to have more flexibility because she was overwhelmed by the idea that I'd be visiting too often even if she didn't have the energy. We acknowledged that I wouldn't go to her place in August as initially envisioned, and we'd wait and see in Autumn. I felt like I could be flexible for her, because a bit of extra cost for last minute tickets isn't an issue compared to moving at a better pace for both of us. She agreed and we parted after a very romantic evening/night.

Our first week apart, I felt like everything was fine. I missed her, and she said it too, but somehow we got back to texting and calling a lot, probably more than we should as both of us had work to deal with. She had a very rough week. Then ten days ago, we were both with bad PMS and had two rough conversations. Different topics but same pattern: she texted for support, I got into overanalysing instead of listening, she withdrew, I felt hurt. Each time, after a few hours, we explained what happened on each side emotionnally and what could have been done different to avoid the hurt, and all was good again for the next day. On Monday I texted that I probably needed more time to digest the two miscommunications, and we discussed by text how to rely less on each other because it's not always possible, she was open and okay, it felt like we were reconnecting in a way. Then I asked how she felt about all that. She went silent for two minutes, then called to break up.

We've been texting everyday since, both initiating contact, both saying I miss yous regularly. I'm deeply hurt and confused, I wonder if I just expected too much from her, if she was lying to herself about her feelings or her capacity to handle anything at all. I wonder if we should go NC (she said she didn't want that but would respect my decision), and/or if we can mend things later, when she's had that personal time to herself and feels ready. The breakup felt so sudden but I'm not too blind as to say it was out of the blue. I can't know if nor when she'll be ready though, and I'm unsure how to proceed now. I still feel like we could be an incredible match, part of me still has this serenity that we're meant to be and I just need to be patient and do my things, spend time with my people, that she'll come around eventually. But there's of course doubt too, and heartbreak.

1mw78cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mw78cs/a_refurbished_home_hides_many_secrets/,A Refurbished Home Hides Many Secrets.,"Despite its fresh paint and polished mosaics, the house felt lived in from the moment I stepped inside. It smelled of plaster dust, sharp and clean, but beneath it clung something older - warmth soaked into the wood, as though the walls remembered meals and laughter. Odd, for a place so recently renovated, a fact the realtor had repeated almost to the point of insistence.

I told myself I needed that renewal. The move wasn’t about square footage or mortgage rates so much as distance. From the old job, the hostile boss, the endless small-office wars. The new position promised steadiness, a manager who listened, colleagues who minded their own work. A clean start, and this house was meant to be the reward.

The kitchen drew me first. Counters stiff beneath my hands, hinges creaking as if relearning motion, the fridge humming in steady breath. Morning light cut through the high window and fractured on the island, spreading across the floor in the shape of a seven-pointed star. I stood there that first morning, coffee cooling in my hand, and thought: it’s a lucky house.

Everywhere I walked, the house seemed to move with me. The third stair lifted its note like a small bell each time I passed. Drafts curved faithfully toward the living room. Doors leaned shut with the softness of pages closing. Rooms guided me always inward, until I found myself where the house seemed to want me: the living room.

There, comfort gathered in full. Cushions slumped warm from the sun, a rug that hushed each step, ceiling beams converging overhead like carved beads. The room wasn’t quite square, but softened, seven-sided, as if shaped more by intent than design. At twilight the beams looked ornamental, suspended like charms.

Even the basement carried that stillness. Its door, freshly painted and oiled, caught the sun as I passed, glowing for a moment before dimming again, as though the house drew its breath inward.

I never went down until the power failed one evening. Flashlight in hand, I turned the knob. It yielded easily.

The air was cool, mineral, faintly sweet, like my grandparents’ wine cellar. Moonlight spilled through the narrow window and fell in neat, careful lines. The floor was too smooth for a basement, the concrete sanded down as though someone had gone to lengths to erase its roughness.

The breaker box gleamed against the far wall, its switches aligned like teeth. I thought of messaging the realtor later, to thank her for such careful refurbishment. It was rare to find a place where even the hidden rooms had been treated with such care.

…

I didn’t properly meet my neighbors until the third week.

I’d seen their houses on my walks - whimsical variations on a core theme, one rising with clean brick lines, another softened by ivy, another brightened with shutters and a garden spilling slightly onto the sidewalk. I thought, now and then, that I glimpsed someone through a window or heard a voice carrying across a lawn, but I could never be sure.

But that evening they arrived together, like a delegation, each balancing something in their hands: bottles of wine with supermarket ribbons, casserole dishes still steaming under foil, a wicker basket lined with a gingham cloth and heavy with bread.

They filled the living room with little effort, arranging themselves on the sofa and chairs as if they’d been here countless times before. Their warmth was immediate, their smiles wide and practiced. In minutes the house was alive with the clink of glasses, the soft scrape of cutlery on bone china, and voices tumbling into laughter.

The food was wonderful - shockingly so. I helped myself to second, third, even fourth servings of lasagna, and tried not to sound overeager as I praised the couple who had brought it. They only exchanged a knowing glance, smiling like proud hosts, though it was my house.

At one point the drawer in the kitchen island jammed as I reached for extra cutlery. I tugged uselessly until one of the men chuckled and brushed past.

“Let me,” he said. A moment later I heard his steps on the basement stairs. He reappeared almost instantly with a screwdriver in hand, triumphant.

“Managed to find it quick enough,” he laughed, as if the tool had been waiting for him.

Later, one of the women excused herself to use the toilet. She stopped halfway down the hall, asking which door it was.

 “Just the next one on your left,” I said.

“Ah,” she replied, nodding with certainty, as though I had only confirmed what she already knew.

Curious, I asked, “Did you know the people who lived here before me?”

For a heartbeat, the room seemed to pause. Then one of them nodded, smiling as he set his glass down.

“Oh yes,” he said. “We knew them all.”

Another added, with a chuckle that was just a little too smooth: “We know this house very well indeed.”

By the time the plates were scraped clean and the last drops of wine drunk, I was flushed with warmth - not only from the alcohol, but from the strange sense of inclusion, of being woven seamlessly into their circle. At the door they thanked me profusely, as though I’d hosted them, pressing my hand or patting my shoulder before vanishing into the night with their emptied dishes.

I locked the door behind them with a kind of satisfaction I hadn’t felt in years. The house glowed with the afterimage of company: the faint perfume of bread and wine, the hum of laughter still clinging to the walls. For the first time, I thought, perhaps I could belong here.

I doused the lights room by room in a slow, meditative rhythm, the old floorboards creaking beneath my steps, until only my bedroom glowed faintly upstairs.

Later, with the window cracked open, I sipped the last half-glass of wine and let the cool night air wash over me. The houses across the street were still lit, squares of gold burning against the dark. Yet no shadows moved behind those curtains, no silhouettes passed in front of lamps. The façades stared back at me, silent and blank, glowing only to insist they were alive.

I told myself the neighbors must simply be tired after the long dinner. The thought soothed me.

I lay down, listening as the house settled around me, boards easing, pipes sighing. And just as sleep began to take me, I heard it - something deeper, muffled, rising from beneath the floorboards. A sound almost too faint to catch. Like the house itself had sighed.

…

The next morning, sunlight slipped through the blinds in its usual pale strips. I showered, dressed, made coffee - ordinary rituals, grounding me in the start of another workday. But when I stepped outside, briefcase in hand, I noticed the street was as empty as the night before. The same houses stood in their neat variations, lights still humming in windows, but not a single person stirred. No slamming of car doors, no joggers, no children waiting for the bus. Even the air seemed to hush itself.

*Was it always this quiet in the mornings?*

I lingered longer than I should have, scanning for the smallest sign of life, until finally I muttered that it was none of my business and walked on.

Work passed uneventfully, but in a good way. A respectful, peaceful work environment - where everyone just sat down, got their work done without fuss. Where exchanges in the break room felt like breaths of fresh air, rather than heavy with tireless gossip and backhanded complements.

Yet when I returned home at dusk, I kept noticing how quiet it all was. The houses lit like stage props, but no cast to play their parts. I unlocked my door and stepped inside, feeling a strange relief to be swallowed again by my own silence. It was peaceful here, wasn’t it? Quieter than anywhere I had lived before.

*This was the kind of life - the kind of neighborhood - I’d always aspired to live in.*

But as I moved about the evening - reheating my left-over casserole, thumbing through a new book, readying for bed - the quiet never really settled.

I kept catching myself looking out at my neighbor’s windows, hoping for some sign - any at all - of movement, but it never came. A peculiar sort of liminality where you felt alone, yet not. 

Something about the way the pipes kept knocking deep below the basement every half-hour or so kept me ever so slightly on edge too. That, and the way the basement door glowed in the setting sun, in hazy hues of crimson melting into amber - like the threatening flare of some watchful, venomous creature - made me wary of it. 

But of course, the power went out again that very night.

*Hilarious.*

I grabbed my torch, reluctant but resigned. 

I sighed, before flicking it on, and navigating my way down to the basement.

In daylight the house felt calm, almost protective, as if its walls had been storing quiet for years and were willing to share it with me. But at night, without the ambient, low light filtering through curtains, the silence seemed to sharpen. The hallways felt longer, the corners heavier, the ceilings higher. Every pane of glass reflected my own movements back at me, as though something else were watching just behind. 

And then there were the faint pinpricks I sometimes noticed only in the darkest corners - tiny red motes, too dim to be dust, too steady to be tricks of my eyes. I told myself they were from the appliances, some unseen standby light or sensor. Still, once seen, they followed me, like scattered eyes half-buried in shadow.

I began to suspect that the peace I’d admired by day was only a mask, and that in the dark the house showed its truer face.

The door swung open soundlessly as I opened it. A scent met me - cold and strong - carrying with it a scent that reminded me of neither mildew nor dust - but something much earthier - like disturbed ground.

I descended, noticing the way the light of my torch seemed to shiver without command. Pipes and boxes, stacked furniture, the expected clutter of an old basement greeted me.

I found the fuse box, flipped the breaker, and heard the house above me click and hum back to life.

I was about to turn and leave, but something about the way the dust particles caught in my torch-beam - as if tugged by a draft from deeper in the dark - drew my attention. 

I followed it a few steps past the reach of the singular bulb overhead, until my torch-light met a section of the wall where the stone looked different, rougher. And lower to the floor, half-hidden behind a shelving unit, I thought I had seen an opening - narrow, almost nothing - just enough to let that strange air breathe through.

I stood there longer than I should have, staring, listening. It felt like the house was holding its breath with me.

I crouched, bringing my face closer to the gap, and pointing my torch into the crack. The draft slid cool across my face, carrying with it that same raw scent of turned earth. The space beyond was narrow, irregular - not a tunnel so much as a crack in the stone, but deep enough that I couldn’t really see where it ended.

I leaned in, squinting, waiting for the beam to catch on something solid. For a few seconds, there was nothing - only shadow piled on shadow, my own breath shallow in the confined space. I sighed, making a note to myself to find a way to seal it off when I had the time. But just as I began to withdraw my head, I thought I saw it: the faintest glimmer, two points suspended in the black, catching the light for a heartbeat before sinking back again. Not bright, not obvious, but enough to give the unmistakable impression of something looking back.

I froze.

I looked again. A pair of eyes. Yearning. Patient. Like a child waiting for a piece of candy.

Unsure what to do, I wordlessly stood up, and headed back up, too afraid to react.

I slammed the basement door behind me and stood there in the hall, chest heaving, the silence of the house pressing close around me. Upstairs the lights glowed steadily again, calm and ordinary, as though nothing had happened at all.

…

Sleep never came. I lay awake in the upstairs bedroom, staring at the ceiling while the clock ticked steadily on the dresser. Every creak of the settling house, every whisper of wind at the shutters set my nerves on edge. When at last the windows began to gray with dawn, it felt less like the start of a new day and more like a reprieve - thin, temporary.

The neighborhood outside was the same as before: lawns trimmed, curtains drawn, driveways empty. The houses simply sat still and shone with their quiet lights. I told myself it was nothing - maybe everyone simply had places to be earlier than I did. 

Regardless, walking to the car, I couldn’t help but feel the weight of a hundred eyes, all unseen behind those curtained windows.

Work did not go well. I sat at my desk fighting to keep upright, fumbling simple tasks, letting emails pile without answer. By midday, my supervisor frowned, then sighed. “You’re no good to us half-asleep. Go home, get some rest.” 

I didn’t argue, but I didn’t really want to go home either. I tried going to a nearby café, two blocks over from my office. 

It was there that my mind finally got some reprieve.

The chatter of strangers, the soft hiss of the espresso machine, the familiar clink of porcelain - all of it wrapped me in a comfort I hadn’t realized I needed. I ordered another coffee, then another, trying to stretch the afternoon out as long as possible. I watched the rain bead against the window, people passing by with their umbrellas, anything to keep my thoughts away from the crack in my basement.

But exhaustion is a patient hunter. 

By the third refill my hands shook with fatigue, and my vision blurred at the edges. I realized, miserably, that I couldn’t outrun sleep forever. When I finally pushed myself up from the table and stepped back into the damp air, the only place left to go was home.

Back in the house, I lay on my sofa, restlessly. The basement kept creeping its way back into my mind.

*What had I really seen? Surely nothing - just a trick of the light, nerves wound tightly by the outage. And yet…*

I sighed, getting up and walking toward the basement door again.

I paced back a forth a few times, before finally committing.

Hesitantly, I turned the knob and descended once more. The air was cool, still. The shelves stood steady, undisturbed. I crouched at the same place, torch in hand, and found the gap utterly ordinary - a thin seam in the stone, no deeper than a foot. Nothing stirred. Nothing stared back.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Everything was normal again. Perfectly, disappointingly normal.

*Just as I had hoped.*

…

That evening, as I was finally getting comfortable again, there was a knock at the door. The same group as before stood on the porch - the women with their practiced smiles, the men carrying covered dishes. I let them in, though something about their presence felt different this time, as if a thread had pulled taut.

They settled in the living room again, chatting lightly, their voices hushed, careful. The food was good, better than I’d expected, but the atmosphere clung close, like damp air. Between mouthfuls, I found myself blurting, “So, what do you all do? For work, I mean. I’ve noticed the mornings are always… quiet.”

The question landed heavier than I intended. For a beat too long, no one answered. Then one of the men chuckled, though it sounded forced. “We keep busy,” he said. Another nodded quickly, adding, “Odd schedules, you know how it is.”

They moved the conversation along before I could press further. Soon after, they excused themselves, leaving behind the remains of the meal and a faint unease that lingered long after the door shut.

I walked them to the porch, waved as they split off toward their homes, then, on impulse, hurried to the window. From behind the curtain, I watched one of the couples - a man in his heavy coat, a woman clutching his arm. They walked without a word, their steps almost too even, too measured. At their door, they didn’t glance around, didn’t fumble with keys, just slipped inside as if the house had opened to them.

I waited, watching the windows for some sign of light or movement. None came. Instead, through a narrow pane near the ground, I saw them descend the stairs. A door opened, a dim glow flickered once - and then they were gone, swallowed by their basement.

*They never came back up.*

…

Sleep became a strained effort from that night onwards.

I kept getting this urge to sit up, and peek out at my neighbors’ homes.

Even when I did commit to sleep, I would constantly startle awake to some faint creaking and rumbling deep in the bowels of the house, and though I told myself it was the house settling, the sound had a way of crawling into my chest and sitting there. 

Every morning, I was gray with exhaustion, my usual coffee just barely keeping me awake.

Work suffered. Several times I nearly nodded off at my desk, once during a meeting. My supervisor suggested I take some time off, “just a week, to clear your head.” I agreed, though I knew no week would be enough.

At home, I found myself glued to the windows. 

I watched the houses like a man waiting for a signal, desperate for proof of life. The lights came on at dusk, glowed steadily until dawn, but not once did I see a curtain twitch or a door open. No one came out for work, no deliveries were ever made, no children played in the yards. Nothing. It was as if the whole street were a set piece, staged for my benefit, while the real activity lay hidden, somewhere.

Perhaps underground.

At night, the noises grew bolder - low thuds, faint clatters, sometimes even the impression of a voice carried through the vents. Each time, I would sit up in bed, heart hammering, staring toward the basement door at the end of the hall. I wanted to go down, to fling it open and see once and for all what waited there. But the thought of facing it froze me in place. Instead, I lay awake until dawn, watching the ceiling, counting every sound, knowing I wouldn’t sleep, 

knowing I couldn’t.

…

The days began to blur together. 

I told myself I was only taking time off to rest, but I hardly left the house. Curtains drawn, lights dimmed, I kept my silent vigil. The neighbors’ windows stared back at me like blind eyes, never once blinking.

I tried to reason it out. Maybe everyone here worked nights. Maybe it was some kind of community agreement - quiet mornings, quiet evenings, nobody making a fuss. But even in saying it, I could hear the falseness. 

I knew what I had seen - or rather what I hadn’t.

I knew the sounds beneath my house weren’t just figments of my imagination.

…

It was in the stillness of one early afternoon that something inside me finally cracked. I had pulled the curtains tight against the light, and in the dimness I noticed it again - that faint, glowing seven-pointed star from the light of the upper window. I’d always thought it charming, once. 

Now?

It looked like an eye, sharp-edged and cruel, glaring down into the room.

*Glaring at me.*

The living room too, felt different. The way the crooked walls leaned in on me, threateningly, conspiring to press the room shut. The ceiling beams that once caught light like beads on a string, pressed down heavily, the joints knotting together in sharp, unnatural angles - less a pattern, but a snare - a geometry that tried to bind me inside it - closing tighter the longer I stared.

And then I saw them again in the dimness: the red specks. 

Tiny pinpricks, barely visible in the darkened corners - one above the archway, another tucked near the ceiling vent, another staring from the hallway like a burning insect. I held my breath, suddenly certain I was not alone.

I rose, slow as if my movements were being watched, and turned toward the nearest light. It was no trick of exhaustion this time. Leaning closer, I saw, nestled in the tangle of a small potted plant, the faint glassy bulge of a lens.

I knew it then. 

I was being watched. 

*They were watching me.* 

The thought struck so sudden I was already moving, stumbling out the door and across the street. My heart thudded like it would split my ribs. I half-expected a curtain to twitch, a shout to stop me—but nothing stirred.

The crooked-shuttered house loomed. I set my hand on the knob. It turned too easily. The lock had clicked, yes, but shallowly, like a toy made only to sound real.

The door swung inward at the faintest push. Inside, the air was cool and stale, as though sealed for years. The living room was tidy—too tidy. A half-read magazine curled yellow on the table, cushions plumped, curtains half-open. It felt staged, preserved, not lived in.

The silence here was heavier than in my own house. Not absence of sound, but absence of life. Every object seemed set slightly apart from itself. My breathing rasped too loud as my gaze fixed on the plain wooden door at the end of the hall.

*The basement.*

I told myself I’d only look, only open it and see. But my hand was already on the knob, already turning. The hinges moaned as I pulled it back. A damp draft curled up from below.

I crouched at the top of the stairs and peered down. The light didn’t reach far - just the first few steps, then shadow. A smell of earth rose up, faintly metallic.

And, steadying myself against the frame, I began to descend.

The steps creaked under my weight, each one louder than the last. I half expected the neighbors to come rushing in, demanding to know what I was doing in their house. But no one came. The air grew colder the farther down I went, the draft sharper against my skin.

The basement was… ordinary. Too ordinary. A washing machine sat in the corner, boxes stacked neatly along the wall, the faint smell of detergent clinging to the stillness. 

For a moment, I almost laughed at myself. Had I really imagined everything?

Of course I hadn’t.

I narrowed my eyes, searching. For what, I wasn’t sure.

And then my sight caught the far wall.

It was there again. The same uneven gap I had in my own basement, the one I had never dared to inspect too closely. A rough seam where the stone and concrete didn’t quite meet, as though the house had been set atop foundations that belonged to something older, something the builders had merely covered rather than disturbed.

I crouched down, pulse jittering against my throat. The gap was wider here, easily large enough to slip a hand through. A breath of cold air pulsed from within, damp and insistent, carrying with it the faintest murmur so faint I couldn’t be sure if it was sound at all, or merely the suggestion of it, shaped by the stone.

I should have turned back. Instead, I pressed my palms against the jagged edges, and the wall shifted. Not much, just enough. Plaster sloughed away in sodden flakes, and beyond it lay a blackness so absolute it seemed to drink the light from the basement.

I don’t know what drove me then - exhaustion, obsession, or some older compulsion seeping out through the crack. Perhaps only the need for finality, the need to force the silence to speak. Whatever it was, I pushed myself forward, scraping through until my shoulders cleared, then my hips, then the soles of my shoes.

And I was inside.

The air was clammy, mineral-heavy, pressing against my lungs. My flashlight shivered over raw stone, catching on lines that didn’t look accidental - rather smooth as if worn down by endless repetition. 

This was a passage.

A tunnel sloped downward at once, a crude incline spiraling into earth. My shoes scraped loose gravel that hissed downslope ahead of me. I hesitated, but the silence behind me felt heavier than what waited below, so I descended.

The air changed as I went. Cooler, yes, but laden too, as if with centuries of dust ground too fine to ever settle. Each breath tasted metallic, faintly briny, as though seawater had long ago seeped into the rock and lingered still.

A sound began to emerge. Not voices, not exactly - more like the collected breath of many people whispering just at the threshold of hearing, not rising or falling but merging into a single tide-pull of sound. I froze, straining to distinguish words. None came. Only that endless susurrus, like waves sucking at shingle, patient and eternal.

Every few steps I looked back. The pale rectangle of the basement was shrinking, already no more than a warped glimmer. My stomach clenched. If that wall sealed itself again - if it had ever been a wall at all - then no one would ever know I was down here.

Still, I kept walking.

I followed the whispering.

The passage twisted illogically, curving left, plunging downward, rising again. My sense of distance unraveled - I could not tell whether I had gone fifty feet or five hundred. The air was cooler still, carrying the musk of confinement, a scent like bodies packed too close together in the dark, though none were there.

Then, at the precipice of nausea and misdirection - I noticed it: a hairline crack in the tunnel wall, faintly familiar. I leaned closer, pressing my eye against it, and my heart lurched. 

On the other side of the thin veil of earth was a room I knew too well. The bare concrete floor, the slant of the steps, the jumble of paint cans in the corner. 

My basement.

The whispers swelled, as if pleased by my recognition. For a mad instant, I felt like they were urging me onward, coaxing me deeper into the labyrinth that stitched neighbor to neighbor, home to home, until perhaps the whole street was webbed together in a single buried artery.

Following the noise, I eventually squeezed through a narrow cleft in the stone, the rough edges rasping my shoulders and peeling cloth from my sleeves, finding myself in a vast chamber.

The air hit me like damp wool; heavy, wet, and sour with the layered stench of decay. The ceiling hung so low I had to stoop, its surface bristling with roots and beads of black condensation that fattened and burst with slow, deliberate ticks. Candles jammed into fissures spat and wept down their stubs, their glow smeared and multiplied in the sweat of the stone. Shadows leaned unnaturally long, folding and overlapping until they seemed to bend around some hidden core, as though the walls themselves recoiled from illumination.

On the earthen floor lay six bodies, each arranged with care along the prongs of a vast figure gouged into the soil. Death had marked each differently: one collapsed into an articulated cage of bone still wearing the husk of a funeral suit, another shriveled to a leathern skin that clung tight as drumhide, another bloated with the greenish swell of half-preserved flesh. A slick of fat glistened at the jaw of one, hardened to yellow wax where it touched the dirt. The mingled odors of sweet corruption, dry mildew, and old earth rolled together into something nauseating but almost reverent, like incense turned sour.

The seventh space gaped empty, its soil churned with fresh scarring, as though impatient hands had redrawn the lines again and again, sharpening the groove to accept what must soon complete it.

Then I looked up.

The walls were crowded with photographs - whole families smiling stiffly on front porches, children’s portraits, candid shots from kitchens and backyards. Beneath them, yellowed leases, school certificates, and utility bills were pinned in meticulous rows. One cluster of images showed a man and woman whose features matched two of the bodies on the ground. Another cluster matched the others.

And then, farther along, I saw my own face. My parents. My siblings. My résumé. Copies of letters I’d written years ago. Camera feeds flickered above it all: my living room, my bedroom, my basement stairs.

The pattern was undeniable. These were the former residents of my house.

I shuddered to think what that meant for me.

Around the chamber’s edge, the neighbors stood in a ring, their faces half-lost in the glow, lips working in a ceaseless chant. The sound was not speech so much as grinding cadence: breath drawn ragged, consonants bitten short, syllables collapsing into one another until they became a shingle of sound that scraped the ear raw.

I pressed myself against the damp, sticky wall, hardly daring to breathe. Their voices rose and fell in uneven cadence, half-prayer, half-conversation, like a crowd rehearsing lines from different plays.

“He suspects.”

“No matter. Tonight he belongs.”

“To our lord.”

Then, cutting through the babble, came a tone I knew at once: calm, polished, practiced.

The realtor.

The same voice that had once praised crown molding and promised a “house with character.” Smooth, unshakable, the voice of someone who never failed to close a deal.

“His place has been waiting,” she said, her words rounded and precise. “The walls already know his name. Our lord already knows his name.”

“They resisted too,” murmured a man, almost sheepish.

“They fought,” said another.

“They wept,” sighed a third, almost fond.

“But all children sleep, in the end.”

“As will the seventh,” the realtor replied, rising above them.

 “And when the seventh sleeps, the circle will be complete. Our lord will breathe through his lungs.”

“Our lord will see through his eyes.”

A low murmur rippled through the circle - threads of hunger, relief, longing, tangled together.

“He is close.”

“He is ready.”

“He will open the way.”

Silence fell, sudden and crushing, as though the air itself had been sucked from the chamber. Only the faint hiss of a candle remained.

My hand slipped against a loose stone. It clattered to the floor - small, ordinary, but in that silence it exploded like a gunshot.

The murmurs died. No one moved.

“…Did you hear that?” a voice whispered.

The silence deepened, shivering, brittle. Then, all at once, every head in the circle turned. Not one after another - all together, too fast, too clean, like marionettes jerked on the same string.

Dozens of blank eyes, glinting in candlelight, fixed on the dark where I crouched.

For a heartbeat, the whole room held its breath. Then the realtor’s voice, soft as velvet closing over a coffin lid:

*“He is here.”*

Adrenaline seized me like a hand on my spine. I lurched upright and bolted, stone skinning my arms as I tore down the passage. Behind me came the shuffle of shoes on earth - not frantic, not clumsy, but steady. Too steady. Dozens of feet striking in perfect unison, every step slamming the chamber like a drumbeat inside my skull.

Then the voices followed, slipping between the rhythm of their march like oil through cloth.

*“Don’t run,”* one said, hollow and even, *“We don’t want you hurting yourself.”*

*“Everything will be okay,”* crooned another, the syllables thick and honey-slow.

The tunnel pressed in tighter, my vision strobing at the edges. I dropped to my knees, palms skidding on damp stone, groping for the slit of light I swore had been there - my basement, my way out.

Behind me the footsteps never faltered, filling the space, filling me, their march and my blood now one deafening rhythm, a heartbeat not my own.

I shoved a shoulder into the gap, bone grinding against rock. The stone tore at my clothes, bit into my skin. For a moment I was wedged - ribs caught, lungs clenching, the earth holding me fast.

The voices drifted closer, weaving between each other like a lullaby.

*“Come back.”*

*“You don’t have to be afraid.”*

I clawed forward, skin peeling, breath shredding in my throat. My hips caught next, and I had to twist, spine screaming, until the stone finally released me with a soundless scrape.

I spilled through at last, sprawling across the cold slab of my basement floor, the sting of torn flesh sharp in the air.

Behind me, the voices did not raise or falter. They seeped through the crack as though the wall itself were speaking, steady as a prayer.

I stumbled up from the basement, clawing for balance, crashing through the kitchen and down the hall. Every breath was a rasp, every step dragging a streak of grit and blood across the floorboards.

The door loomed before me - simple, familiar, absurd in its ordinariness. The frosted glass glowed faintly, a pale imitation of daylight. Safety. Escape. Life.

I seized the knob with both hands, slick with sweat and blood. It turned, yes - it turned like it always had. But when I pulled, the house answered.

Clack.

Not the dull, human sound of a deadbolt. No. This was sharper, metallic, hungry. A sound like teeth closing around bone.

The seams along the frame shuddered. The wood moaned, fibers tightening like sinew, as if the whole house clenched at once to hold me inside.

*“No, no, no-”* My own voice came back to me, ragged and unrecognizable.

I rushed back to the basement door and threw the bolt, then dragged a shelf into place, books and tools crashing to the floor in a rain of useless clatter.

For a moment, silence. Only my pulse in my ears.

Then - the sound of the knob turning, softly, patiently. A creak, then a slow knock. Three measured raps.

Murmurs from behind the wood, sweet and stale.

*“Don’t lock us out.”*

*“We all belong here together.”*

Panic clawed higher in my throat. I staggered through the hall, into the kitchen, grabbing at the back door. The knob twisted beneath my palm, but the same click followed - the wood tightening as if bracing itself to hold me in.

A shape caught my eye - motion at the window.

I turned.

Across the yard, my neighbor was stepping from his porch, stiff and deliberate, eyes fixed on me. Then another, and another. They crossed the lawn without a sound, gathering along my house.

They pressed themselves to the windows.

Every one of them.

Palms spread flat. Faces leaned close, cheek to pane. Their eyes stared through at me, unblinking, catching the faint light in strange reflections that looked too bright, too wet.

A dozen mouths moved at once, muffled by the glass, whispering things I couldn’t make out, but all of them smiling, all of them watching.

The whispers overlapped, swelled, some voices turning sharp, almost scolding

*“Stop it. Stop it.”*

*“Our lord won’t be happy with you.”*

Others curled into a cloying sing-song, 

*“Don’t worry, sweetheart. You’re safe here. We’ll take care of you.”*

The house vibrated with it, the glass humming faintly as their breath fogged the panes. Smiles stretched too wide, too steady, splitting into snarls and croons.

I stumbled back, heart hammering, staring at the impossible wall of faces around me. Every window on the first floor was filled. I was sealed inside, trapped in my own house, their voices clawing at me from all directions.

Panic seized me. My eyes shot upward - the stairs. The bedroom.

I bolted, two steps at a time, my body lurching forward as if chased by the noise swelling below. I burst into my room, chest heaving, and grabbed at the curtain.

Outside: my car, parked at the curb. My only chance.

For a moment I froze, the chanting rising beneath me, swelling into something that wasn’t words anymore, just a pressure in my skull.

Then I drove my heel into the glass.

It shattered around me in an explosion of cold shards, the afternoon air slicing my face. Without another thought I hurled myself through, down onto the pavement.

The pain was immediate, white-hot, snapping through my leg like fire. My ankle folded under me with a sickening crack. I screamed, or thought I did - the sound drowned in the roar of blood in my ears.

I rolled onto my side, vision warping, breath hitching against the shock. The night smelled of iron and dust, my face wet where glass had sliced it.

*Move. Move.*

My car loomed just yards away, unreal and shining under the streetlight. I clawed across the lawn, dragging my useless leg, grass slick beneath my palms. Every shift of my weight sent agony screaming up my body, but the chanting from the house was louder now, echoing out through the broken window, their voices a chorus spilling into the night:

“Come back.”

“You’re safe with us.”

“Don’t run.”

“He is waiting for you.”

I hit the curb, fumbling at my pocket, keys slick with blood. Somehow I got them into the lock. Somehow I turned. The handle gave, and I dragged myself inside, collapsing against the steering wheel, gasping, the horn blaring once in a long, muffled note.

The house behind me pulsed with voices, calling, pleading, demanding.

Then the sound changed. No longer steady, no longer coaxing - it broke apart. Ragged sobs, hiccupping wails, voices tearing themselves raw. Some keened like children. Others moaned low and guttural, as though their throats were splitting under the strain.

And their mouths - God, their mouths. Lips quivering, stretching too wide, some grinning, some crumpled into masks of grief, every face vibrating with need. The voices overlapped until words were nothing but noise, then reassembled, jagged and broken:

*“Our lord needs you.”*

*“Our lord needs your body.”*

*“What will our lord do without you?”*

Some shrieked it high and thin, others crooned it like nursery songs, syllables slurring through their sobs. It was a chorus of grief, of hunger, of worship. A sound that didn’t belong in human throats.

The nearest neighbor pressed her face against the windshield, teeth bared in a rictus that was half a smile, half a sob. Her breath fogged the glass in frantic bursts, and she dragged her tongue across it, leaving a wet smear that ran down like tears.

*“Don’t leave us.”*

*“Don’t leave him.”*

*“Don’t leave.”*

Their wailing rattled the street, a dirge swelling until it shook the engine itself.

I twisted the key - once, twice. My ankle throbbed like fire, the pain snapping my vision white, but I forced it again. The engine coughed, sputtered - then roared.

As I slammed the pedal, the car lurched forward, wheels thudding over bodies that broke apart too easily, like brittle effigies stuffed with wet leaves.

In the rearview mirror they collapsed to their knees, clawing at the pavement, arms outstretched, their cries echoing after me: not anger, not threat. 

Just a howling, endless grief.

I didn’t stop driving until the houses thinned, until the highway signs gave way to the smear of city lights. Every throb of my ankle was a reminder that I wasn’t dreaming. I pushed until the tank hit red and found a cheap motel off the interstate, the kind with buzzing neon and a clerk who didn’t bother to look up.

For three nights I barely slept. Curtains drawn tight, TV humming low. Every time I closed my eyes I saw the glass, the mouths, the way their palms pressed against me like the house itself was breathing. I lived off vending machine snacks and the emergency cash I’d crammed in my glovebox months ago and forgotten.

On the fourth morning I couldn’t stand it anymore. My leg was swollen purple, every nerve screaming, and I knew I had to tell someone. Anyone.

The police station was fluorescent and humming, antiseptic in a way that almost calmed me. I stood at the counter, swaying on my good foot, and when the officer asked what was wrong, the words tumbled out.

“There were people, they - they were at my house, they wouldn’t let me leave, they knew my name, they said things about a lord, I think they wanted to sacrifice me to it, they-”

My voice broke. I gripped the counter, knuckles white, trying to steady my breath. The officer gave me that look, the careful, measured one they must practice for drunks and lunatics.

And then my gaze drifted - just for a moment - to the badge on his chest.

And I froze.

The badge gleamed under the light, sharper than it should, every line too clear.

I’d seen them before. Hell, maybe this one had always been like that. But looking at it now, it seemed wrong - too perfect, too deliberate, each point cutting the air like a blade.

“…Was it…” My throat closed. I forced the words out.

*“…Was it always a seven-pointed star?”*",10,1755772342.0,nosleep,0,0.92,False

I also like a bit of aesthetics mixed in. I'm looking for a white case with proper room for figures and decor. I was looking at HYTE Y70, but I'm not sure if it's actually good or overhyped. I like the idea of a little screen to use for an app to monitor temps and in standby, put a gif on it. Aesthetic wise I want something white and blue and maybe food related decor. Something like Cinnamoroll and cafe food type stuff. I don't care about the color of the parts inside as much. I also need recommendations on a liquid cooler. The case can be plain white, decor comes after anyways.

TL;DR: Need white desktop case recommendation to fit Cinnamoroll and cafe food aesthetics (Sky blue, cloud, pancakes/cake, and coffee/tea type decor), liquid cooler recommendations, and insight on if HYTE Y70 is a good fit or not. You can recommend anything and give any insight.

Build: Compatible With ATX, Windows Pro, Liquid Cooler, White Case, Blue Extension Cables, 2 Sticks Of 34gb Of Ram, OLED Main Monitor, Tons Of Storage (2Tb or more?)
All recommendations and inputs are welcome. I'm using this pc for gaming, streaming, art, voice acting, and more creative type stuff. I want something future proof and powerful. I don't want something that isn't worth the price. Like when new iphones come out and they overcharge. I don't want overcharged stuff, I want something well worth the money.

Budget: Around 2k? Would prefer under, but can afford more if reasonable. Money isn't the issue, just don't wanna be wasteful with it. (Expensive ≠ Quality)
Budget is flexible 2k-3k. (Only if needed, building this within a couple months preferably.)

It smelled of plaster dust, sharp and clean, but beneath it clung something older - warmth soaked into the wood, as though the walls remembered meals and laughter. Odd, for a place so recently renovated, a fact the realtor had repeated almost to the point of insistence.

I told myself I needed that renewal. The move wasn’t about square footage or mortgage rates so much as distance. From the old job, the hostile boss, the endless small-office wars. The new position promised steadiness, a manager who listened, colleagues who minded their own work. A clean start, and this house was meant to be the reward.

The kitchen drew me first. Counters stiff beneath my hands, hinges creaking as if relearning motion, the fridge humming in steady breath. Morning light cut through the high window and fractured on the island, spreading across the floor in the shape of a seven-pointed star. I stood there that first morning, coffee cooling in my hand, and thought: it’s a lucky house.

Everywhere I walked, the house seemed to move with me. The third stair lifted its note like a small bell each time I passed. Drafts curved faithfully toward the living room. Doors leaned shut with the softness of pages closing. Rooms guided me always inward, until I found myself where the house seemed to want me: the living room.

There, comfort gathered in full. Cushions slumped warm from the sun, a rug that hushed each step, ceiling beams converging overhead like carved beads. The room wasn’t quite square, but softened, seven-sided, as if shaped more by intent than design. At twilight the beams looked ornamental, suspended like charms.

Even the basement carried that stillness. Its door, freshly painted and oiled, caught the sun as I passed, glowing for a moment before dimming again, as though the house drew its breath inward.

I never went down until the power failed one evening. Flashlight in hand, I turned the knob. It yielded easily.

The air was cool, mineral, faintly sweet, like my grandparents’ wine cellar. Moonlight spilled through the narrow window and fell in neat, careful lines. The floor was too smooth for a basement, the concrete sanded down as though someone had gone to lengths to erase its roughness.

The breaker box gleamed against the far wall, its switches aligned like teeth. I thought of messaging the realtor later, to thank her for such careful refurbishment. It was rare to find a place where even the hidden rooms had been treated with such care.

…

I didn’t properly meet my neighbors until the third week.

I’d seen their houses on my walks - whimsical variations on a core theme, one rising with clean brick lines, another softened by ivy, another brighted with shutters and a garden spilling slightly onto the sidewalk. I thought, now and then, that I glimpsed someone through a window or heard a voice carrying across a lawn, but I could never be sure.

But that evening they arrived together, like a delegation, each balancing something in their hands: bottles of wine with supermarket ribbons, casserole dishes still steaming under foil, a wicker basket lined with a gingham cloth and heavy with bread.

They filled the living room with little effort, arranging themselves on the sofa and chairs as if they’d been here countless times before. Their warmth was immediate, their smiles wide and practiced. In minutes the house was alive with the clink of glasses, the soft scrape of cutlery on china, and voices tumbling into laughter.

The food was wonderful - shockingly so. I helped myself to second, third, even fourth servings of lasagna, and tried not to sound overeager as I praised the couple who had brought it. They only exchanged a knowing glance, smiling like proud hosts, though it was my house.

At one point the drawer in the kitchen island jammed as I reached for extra cutlery. I tugged uselessly until one of the men chuckled and brushed past.

“Let me,” he said. A moment later I heard his steps on the basement stairs. He reappeared almost instantly with a screwdriver in hand, triumphant.

“Managed to find it quick enough,” he laughed, as if the tool had been waiting for him.

Later, one of the women excused herself to use the toilet. She stopped halfway down the hall, asking which door it was.

 “Just the next one on your left,” I said.

“Ah,” she replied, nodding with certainty, as though I had only confirmed what she already knew.

Curious, I asked, “Did you know the people who lived here before me?”

For a heartbeat, the room seemed to pause. Then one of them nodded, smiling as he set his glass down.

“Oh yes,” he said. “We knew them all.”

Another added, with a chuckle that was just a little too smooth: “We know this house very well indeed.”

By the time the plates were scraped clean and the last drops of wine drunk, I was flushed with warmth - not only from the alcohol, but from the strange sense of inclusion, of being woven seamlessly into their circle. At the door they thanked me profusely, as though I’d hosted them, pressing my hand or patting my shoulder before vanishing into the night with their emptied dishes.

I locked the door behind them with a kind of satisfaction I hadn’t felt in years. The house glowed with the afterimage of company: the faint perfume of bread and wine, the hum of laughter still clinging to the walls. For the first time, I thought, perhaps I could belong here.

I doused the lights room by room in a slow, meditative rhythm, the old floorboards creaking beneath my steps, until only my bedroom glowed faintly upstairs.

Later, with the window cracked open, I sipped the last half-glass of wine and let the cool night air wash over me. The houses across the street were still lit, squares of gold burning against the dark. Yet no shadows moved behind those curtains, no silhouettes passed in front of lamps. The façades stared back at me, silent and blank, glowing only to insist they were alive.

I told myself the neighbors must simply be tired after the long dinner. The thought soothed me.

I lay down, listening as the house settled around me, boards easing, pipes sighing. And just as sleep began to take me, I heard it - something deeper, muffled, rising from beneath the floorboards. A sound almost too faint to catch. Like the house itself had sighed.

…

The next morning, sunlight slipped through the blinds in its usual pale strips. I showered, dressed, made coffee - ordinary rituals, grounding me in the start of another workday. But when I stepped outside, briefcase in hand, I noticed the street was as empty as the night before. The same houses stood in their neat variations, lights still humming in windows, but not a single person stirred. No slamming of car doors, no joggers, no children waiting for the bus. Even the air seemed to hush itself.

*Was it always this quiet in the mornings?*

I lingered longer than I should have, scanning for the smallest sign of life, until finally I muttered that it was none of my business and walked on.

Work passed uneventfully, but in a good way. A respectful, peaceful work environment - where everyone just sat down, got their work done without fuss. Where exchanges in the break room felt like breaths of fresh air, rather than heavy with tireless gossip and backhanded complements.

Yet when I returned home at dusk, I kept noticing how quiet it all was. The houses lit like stage props, but no cast to play their parts. I unlocked my door and stepped inside, feeling a strange relief to be swallowed again by my own silence. It was peaceful here, wasn’t it? Quieter than anywhere I had lived before.

*This was the kind of life - the kind of neighborhood - I’d always aspired to live in.*

But as I moved about the evening - reheating my left-over casserole, thumbing through a new book, readying for bed - the quiet never really settled.

I kept catching myself looking out at my neighbor’s windows, hoping for some sign - any at all - of movement, but it never came. A peculiar sort of liminality where you felt alone, yet not. 

Something about the way the pipes kept knocking deep below the basement every half-hour or so kept me ever so slightly on edge too. That, and the way the basement door glowed in the setting sun, in hazy hues of crimson melting into amber - like the threatening flare of some watchful, venomous creature - made me wary of it. 

But of course, the power went out again that very night.

*Hilarious.*

I grabbed my torch, reluctant but resigned. 

I sighed, before flicking it on, and navigating my way down to the basement.

In daylight the house felt calm, almost protective, as if its walls had been storing quiet for years and were willing to share it with me. But at night, without the ambient, low light filtering through curtains, the silence seemed to sharpen. The hallways felt longer, the corners heavier, the ceilings higher. Every pane of glass reflected my own movements back at me, as though something else were watching just behind. 

And then there were the faint pinpricks I sometimes noticed only in the darkest corners - tiny red motes, too dim to be dust, too steady to be tricks of my eyes. I told myself they were from the appliances, some unseen standby light or sensor. Still, once seen, they followed me, like scattered eyes half-buried in shadow.

I began to suspect that the peace I’d admired by day was only a mask, and that in the dark the house showed its truer face.

The door swung open soundlessly as I opened it. A scent met me - cold and strong - carrying with it a scent that reminded me of neither mildew nor dust - but something much earthier - like disturbed ground.

I descended, noticing the way the light of my torch seemed to shiver without command. Pipes and boxes, stacked furniture, the expected clutter of an old basement greeted me.

I found the fuse box, flipped the breaker, and heard the house above me click and hum back to life.

I was about to turn and leave, but something about the way the dust particles caught in my torch-beam - as if tugged by a draft from deeper in the dark - drew my attention. 

I followed it a few steps past the reach of the singular bulb overhead, until my torch-light met a section of the wall where the stone looked different, rougher. And lower to the floor, half-hidden behind a shelving unit, I thought I had seen an opening - narrow, almost nothing - just enough to let that strange air breathe through.

I stood there longer than I should have, staring, listening. It felt like the house was holding its breath with me.

I crouched, bringing my face closer to the gap, and pointing my torch into the crack. The draft slid cool across my face, carrying with it that same raw scent of turned earth. The space beyond was narrow, irregular - not a tunnel so much as a crack in the stone, but deep enough that I couldn’t really see where it ended.

I leaned in, squinting, waiting for the beam to catch on something solid. For a few seconds, there was nothing - only shadow piled on shadow, my own breath shallow in the confined space. I sighed, making a note to myself to find a way to seal it off when I had the time. But just as I began to withdraw my head, I thought I saw it: the faintest glimmer, two points suspended in the black, catching the light for a heartbeat before sinking back again. Not bright, not obvious, but enough to give the unmistakable impression of something looking back.

I froze.

I looked again. A pair of eyes. Yearning. Patient. Like a child waiting for a piece of candy.

Unsure what to do, I wordlessly stood up, and headed back up, too afraid to react.

I slammed the basement door behind me and stood there in the hall, chest heaving, the silence of the house pressing close around me. Upstairs the lights glowed steadily again, calm and ordinary, as though nothing had happened at all.

…

Sleep never came. I lay awake in the upstairs bedroom, staring at the ceiling while the clock ticked steadily on the dresser. Every creak of the settling house, every whisper of wind at the shutters set my nerves on edge. When at last the windows began to gray with dawn, it felt less like the start of a new day and more like a reprieve - thin, temporary.

The neighborhood outside was the same as before: lawns trimmed, curtains drawn, driveways empty. The houses simply sat still and shone with their quiet lights. I told myself it was nothing - maybe everyone simply had places to be earlier than I did. 

Regardless, walking to the car, I couldn’t help but feel the weight of a hundred eyes, all unseen behind those curtained windows.

Work did not go well. I sat at my desk fighting to keep upright, fumbling simple tasks, letting emails pile without answer. By midday, my supervisor frowned, then sighed. “You’re no good to us half-asleep. Go home, get some rest.” 

I didn’t argue, but I didn’t really want to go home either. I tried going to a nearby café, two blocks over from my office. 

It was there that my mind finally got some reprieve.

The chatter of strangers, the soft hiss of the espresso machine, the familiar clink of porcelain - all of it wrapped me in a comfort I hadn’t realized I needed. I ordered another coffee, then another, trying to stretch the afternoon out as long as possible. I watched the rain bead against the window, people passing by with their umbrellas, anything to keep my thoughts away from the crack in my basement.

But exhaustion is a patient hunter. 

By the third refill my hands shook with fatigue, and my vision blurred at the edges. I realized, miserably, that I couldn’t outrun sleep forever. When I finally pushed myself up from the table and stepped back into the damp air, the only place left to go was home.

Back in the house, I lay on my sofa, restlessly. The basement kept creeping its way back into my mind.

*What had I really seen? Surely nothing - just a trick of the light, nerves wound tightly by the outage. And yet…*

I sighed, getting up and walking toward the basement door again.

I paced back a forth a few times, before finally committing.

Hesitantly, I turned the knob and descended once more. The air was cool, still. The shelves stood steady, undisturbed. I crouched at the same place, torch in hand, and found the gap utterly ordinary - a thin seam in the stone, no deeper than a foot. Nothing stirred. Nothing stared back.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Everything was normal again. Perfectly, disappointingly normal.

*Just as I had hoped.*

…

That evening, as I was finally getting comfortable again, there was a knock at the door. The same group as before stood on the porch - the women with their practiced smiles, the men carrying covered dishes. I let them in, though something about their presence felt different this time, as if a thread had pulled taut.

They settled in the living room again, chatting lightly, their voices hushed, careful. The food was good, better than I’d expected, but the atmosphere clung close, like damp air. Between mouthfuls, I found myself blurting, “So, what do you all do? For work, I mean. I’ve noticed the mornings are always… quiet.”

The question landed heavier than I intended. For a beat too long, no one answered. Then one of the men chuckled, though it sounded forced. “We keep busy,” he said. Another nodded quickly, adding, “Odd schedules, you know how it is.”

They moved the conversation along before I could press further. Soon after, they excused themselves, leaving behind the remains of the meal and a faint unease that lingered long after the door shut.

I walked them to the porch, waved as they split off toward their homes, then, on impulse, hurried to the window. From behind the curtain, I watched one of the couples - a man in his heavy coat, a woman clutching his arm. They walked without a word, their steps almost too even, too measured. At their door, they didn’t glance around, didn’t fumble with keys, just slipped inside as if the house had opened to them.

I waited, watching the windows for some sign of light or movement. None came. Instead, through a narrow pane near the ground, I saw them descend the stairs. A door opened, a dim glow flickered once - and then they were gone, swallowed by their basement.

*They never came back up.*

…

Sleep became a strained effort from that night onwards.

I kept getting this urge to sit up, and peek out at my neighbors’ homes.

Even when I did commit to sleep, I would constantly startle awake to some faint creaking and rumbling deep in the bowels of the house, and though I told myself it was the house settling, the sound had a way of crawling into my chest and sitting there. 

Every morning, I was gray with exhaustion, my usual coffee just barely keeping me awake.

Work suffered. Several times I nearly nodded off at my desk, once during a meeting. My supervisor suggested I take some time off, “just a week, to clear your head.” I agreed, though I knew no week would be enough.

At home, I found myself glued to the windows. 

I watched the houses like a man waiting for a signal, desperate for proof of life. The lights came on at dusk, glowed steadily until dawn, but not once did I see a curtain twitch or a door open. No one came out for work, no deliveries were ever made, no children played in the yards. Nothing. It was as if the whole street were a set piece, staged for my benefit, while the real activity lay hidden, somewhere.

Perhaps underground.

At night, the noises grew bolder - low thuds, faint clatters, sometimes even the impression of a voice carried through the vents. Each time, I would sit up in bed, heart hammering, staring toward the basement door at the end of the hall. I wanted to go down, to fling it open and see once and for all what waited there. But the thought of facing it froze me in place. Instead, I lay awake until dawn, watching the ceiling, counting every sound, knowing I wouldn’t sleep, 

knowing I couldn’t.

…

The days began to blur together. 

I told myself I was only taking time off to rest, but I hardly left the house. Curtains drawn, lights dimmed, I kept my silent vigil. The neighbors’ windows stared back at me like blind eyes, never once blinking.

I tried to reason it out. Maybe everyone here worked nights. Maybe it was some kind of community agreement - quiet mornings, quiet evenings, nobody making a fuss. But even in saying it, I could hear the falseness. 

I knew what I had seen - or rather what I hadn’t.

I knew the sounds beneath my house weren’t just figments of my imagination.

…

It was in the stillness of one early afternoon that something inside me finally cracked. I had pulled the curtains tight against the light, and in the dimness I noticed it again - that faint, glowing seven-pointed star from the light of the upper window. I’d always thought it charming, once. 

Now?

It looked like an eye, sharp-edged and cruel, glaring down into the room.

*Glaring at me.*

The living room too, felt different. The way the crooked walls leaned in on me, threateningly, conspiring to press the room shut. The ceiling beams that once caught light like beads on a string, pressed down heavily, the joints knotting together in sharp, unnatural angles - less a pattern, but a snare - a geometry that tried to bind me inside it - closing tighter the longer I stared.

And then I saw them again in the dimness: the red specks. 

Tiny pinpricks, barely visible in the darkened corners - one above the archway, another tucked near the ceiling vent, another staring from the hallway like a burning insect. I held my breath, suddenly certain I was not alone.

I rose, slow as if my movements were being watched, and turned toward the nearest light. It was no trick of exhaustion this time. Leaning closer, I saw, nestled in the tangle of a small potted plant, the faint glassy bulge of a lens.

I knew it then. 

I was being watched. 

*They were watching me.* 

The thought struck so sudden I was already moving, stumbling out the door and across the street. My heart thudded like it would split my ribs. I half-expected a curtain to twitch, a shout to stop me—but nothing stirred.

The crooked-shuttered house loomed. I set my hand on the knob. It turned too easily. The lock had clicked, yes, but shallowly, like a toy made only to sound real.

The door swung inward at the faintest push. Inside, the air was cool and stale, as though sealed for years. The living room was tidy—too tidy. A half-read magazine curled yellow on the table, cushions plumped, curtains half-open. It felt staged, preserved, not lived in.

The silence here was heavier than in my own house. Not absence of sound, but absence of life. Every object seemed set slightly apart from itself. My breathing rasped too loud as my gaze fixed on the plain wooden door at the end of the hall.

*The basement.*

I told myself I’d only look, only open it and see. But my hand was already on the knob, already turning. The hinges moaned as I pulled it back. A damp draft curled up from below.

I crouched at the top of the stairs and peered down. The light didn’t reach far - just the first few steps, then shadow. A smell of earth rose up, faintly metallic.

And, steadying myself against the frame, I began to descend.

The steps creaked under my weight, each one louder than the last. I half expected the neighbors to come rushing in, demanding to know what I was doing in their house. But no one came. The air grew colder the farther down I went, the draft sharper against my skin.

The basement was… ordinary. Too ordinary. A washing machine sat in the corner, boxes stacked neatly along the wall, the faint smell of detergent clinging to the stillness. 

For a moment, I almost laughed at myself. Had I really imagined everything?

Of course I hadn’t.

I narrowed my eyes, searching. For what, I wasn’t sure.

And then my sight caught the far wall.

It was there again. The same uneven gap I had in my own basement, the one I had never dared to inspect too closely. A rough seam where the stone and concrete didn’t quite meet, as though the house had been set atop foundations that belonged to something older, something the builders had merely covered rather than disturbed.

I crouched down, pulse jittering against my throat. The gap was wider here, easily large enough to slip a hand through. A breath of cold air pulsed from within, damp and insistent, carrying with it the faintest murmur so faint I couldn’t be sure if it was sound at all, or merely the suggestion of it, shaped by the stone.

I should have turned back. Instead, I pressed my palms against the jagged edges, and the wall shifted. Not much, just enough. Plaster sloughed away in sodden flakes, and beyond it lay a blackness so absolute it seemed to drink the light from the basement.

I don’t know what drove me then - exhaustion, obsession, or some older compulsion seeping out through the crack. Perhaps only the need for finality, the need to force the silence to speak. Whatever it was, I pushed myself forward, scraping through until my shoulders cleared, then my hips, then the soles of my shoes.

And I was inside.

The air was clammy, mineral-heavy, pressing against my lungs. My flashlight shivered over raw stone, catching on lines that didn’t look accidental - rather smooth as if worn down by endless repetition. 

This was a passage.

A tunnel sloped downward at once, a crude incline spiraling into earth. My shoes scraped loose gravel that hissed downslope ahead of me. I hesitated, but the silence behind me felt heavier than what waited below, so I descended.

The air changed as I went. Cooler, yes, but laden too, as if with centuries of dust ground too fine to ever settle. Each breath tasted metallic, faintly briny, as though seawater had long ago seeped into the rock and lingered still.

A sound began to emerge. Not voices, not exactly - more like the collected breath of many people whispering just at the threshold of hearing, not rising or falling but merging into a single tide-pull of sound. I froze, straining to distinguish words. None came. Only that endless susurrus, like waves sucking at shingle, patient and eternal.

Every few steps I looked back. The pale rectangle of the basement was shrinking, already no more than a warped glimmer. My stomach clenched. If that wall sealed itself again - if it had ever been a wall at all - then no one would ever know I was down here.

Still, I kept walking.

I followed the whispering.

The passage twisted illogically, curving left, plunging downward, rising again. My sense of distance unraveled - I could not tell whether I had gone fifty feet or five hundred. The air was cooler still, carrying the musk of confinement, a scent like bodies packed too close together in the dark, though none were there.

Then, at the precipice of nausea and misdirection - I noticed it: a hairline crack in the tunnel wall, faintly familiar. I leaned closer, pressing my eye against it, and my heart lurched. 

On the other side of the thin veil of earth was a room I knew too well. The bare concrete floor, the slant of the steps, the jumble of paint cans in the corner. 

My basement.

The whispers swelled, as if pleased by my recognition. For a mad instant, I felt like they were urging me onward, coaxing me deeper into the labyrinth that stitched neighbor to neighbor, home to home, until perhaps the whole street was webbed together in a single buried artery.

Following the noise, I eventually squeezed through a narrow cleft in the stone, the rough edges rasping my shoulders and peeling cloth from my sleeves, finding myself in a vast chamber.

The air hit me like damp wool; heavy, wet, and sour with the layered stench of decay. The ceiling hung so low I had to stoop, its surface bristling with roots and beads of black condensation that fattened and burst with slow, deliberate ticks. Candles jammed into fissures spat and wept down their stubs, their glow smeared and multiplied in the sweat of the stone. Shadows leaned unnaturally long, folding and overlapping until they seemed to bend around some hidden core, as though the walls themselves recoiled from illumination.

On the earthen floor lay six bodies, each arranged with care along the prongs of a vast figure gouged into the soil. Death had marked each differently: one collapsed into an articulated cage of bone still wearing the husk of a funeral suit, another shriveled to a leathern skin that clung tight as drumhide, another bloated with the greenish swell of half-preserved flesh. A slick of fat glistened at the jaw of one, hardened to yellow wax where it touched the dirt. The mingled odors of sweet corruption, dry mildew, and old earth rolled together into something nauseating but almost reverent, like incense turned sour.

The seventh space gaped empty, its soil churned with fresh scarring, as though impatient hands had redrawn the lines again and again, sharpening the groove to accept what must soon complete it.

Then I looked up.

The walls were crowded with photographs - whole families smiling stiffly on front porches, children’s portraits, candid shots from kitchens and backyards. Beneath them, yellowed leases, school certificates, and utility bills were pinned in meticulous rows. One cluster of images showed a man and woman whose features matched two of the bodies on the ground. Another cluster matched the others.

And then, farther along, I saw my own face. My parents. My siblings. My résumé. Copies of letters I’d written years ago. Camera feeds flickered above it all: my living room, my bedroom, my basement stairs.

The pattern was undeniable. These were the former residents of my house.

I shuddered to think what that meant for me.

Around the chamber’s edge, the neighbors stood in a ring, their faces half-lost in the glow, lips working in a ceaseless chant. The sound was not speech so much as grinding cadence: breath drawn ragged, consonants bitten short, syllables collapsing into one another until they became a shingle of sound that scraped the ear raw.

I pressed myself against the damp, sticky wall, hardly daring to breathe. Their voices rose and fell in uneven cadence, half-prayer, half-conversation, like a crowd rehearsing lines from different plays.

“He suspects.”

“No matter. Tonight he belongs.”

“To our lord.”

Then, cutting through the babble, came a tone I knew at once: calm, polished, practiced.

The realtor.

The same voice that had once praised crown molding and promised a “house with character.” Smooth, unshakable, the voice of someone who never failed to close a deal.

“His place has been waiting,” she said, her words rounded and precise. “The walls already know his name. Our lord already knows his name.”

“They resisted too,” murmured a man, almost sheepish.

“They fought,” said another.

“They wept,” sighed a third, almost fond.

“But all children sleep, in the end.”

“As will the seventh,” the realtor replied, rising above them.

 “And when the seventh sleeps, the circle will be complete. Our lord will breathe through his lungs.”

“Our lord will see through his eyes.”

A low murmur rippled through the circle - threads of hunger, relief, longing, tangled together.

“He is close.”

“He is ready.”

“He will open the way.”

Silence fell, sudden and crushing, as though the air itself had been sucked from the chamber. Only the faint hiss of a candle remained.

My hand slipped against a loose stone. It clattered to the floor - small, ordinary, but in that silence it exploded like a gunshot.

The murmurs died. No one moved.

“…Did you hear that?” a voice whispered.

The silence deepened, shivering, brittle. Then, all at once, every head in the circle turned. Not one after another - all together, too fast, too clean, like marionettes jerked on the same string.

Dozens of blank eyes, glinting in candlelight, fixed on the dark where I crouched.

For a heartbeat, the whole room held its breath. Then the realtor’s voice, soft as velvet closing over a coffin lid:

*“He is here.”*

Adrenaline seized me like a hand on my spine. I lurched upright and bolted, stone skinning my arms as I tore down the passage. Behind me came the shuffle of shoes on earth - not frantic, not clumsy, but steady. Too steady. Dozens of feet striking in perfect unison, every step slamming the chamber like a drumbeat inside my skull.

Then the voices followed, slipping between the rhythm of their march like oil through cloth.

*“Don’t run,”* one said, hollow and even, *“We don’t want you hurting yourself.”*

*“Everything will be okay,”* crooned another, the syllables thick and honey-slow.

The tunnel pressed in tighter, my vision strobing at the edges. I dropped to my knees, palms skidding on damp stone, groping for the slit of light I swore had been there - my basement, my way out.

Behind me the footsteps never faltered, filling the space, filling me, their march and my blood now one deafening rhythm, a heartbeat not my own.

I shoved a shoulder into the gap, bone grinding against rock. The stone tore at my clothes, bit into my skin. For a moment I was wedged - ribs caught, lungs clenching, the earth holding me fast.

The voices drifted closer, weaving between each other like a lullaby.

*“Come back.”*

*“You don’t have to be afraid.”*

I clawed forward, skin peeling, breath shredding in my throat. My hips caught next, and I had to twist, spine screaming, until the stone finally released me with a soundless scrape.

I spilled through at last, sprawling across the cold slab of my basement floor, the sting of torn flesh sharp in the air.

Behind me, the voices did not raise or falter. They seeped through the crack as though the wall itself were speaking, steady as a prayer.

I stumbled up from the basement, clawing for balance, crashing through the kitchen and down the hall. Every breath was a rasp, every step dragging a streak of grit and blood across the floorboards.

The door loomed before me - simple, familiar, absurd in its ordinariness. The frosted glass glowed faintly, a pale imitation of daylight. Safety. Escape. Life.

I seized the knob with both hands, slick with sweat and blood. It turned, yes - it turned like it always had. But when I pulled, the house answered.

Clack.

Not the dull, human sound of a deadbolt. No. This was sharper, metallic, hungry. A sound like teeth closing around bone.

The seams along the frame shuddered. The wood moaned, fibers tightening like sinew, as if the whole house clenched at once to hold me inside.

*“No, no, no-”* My own voice came back to me, ragged and unrecognizable.

I rushed back to the basement door and threw the bolt, then dragged a shelf into place, books and tools crashing to the floor in a rain of useless clatter.

For a moment, silence. Only my pulse in my ears.

Then - the sound of the knob turning, softly, patiently. A creak, then a slow knock. Three measured raps.

Murmurs from behind the wood, sweet and stale.

*“Don’t lock us out.”*

*“We all belong here together.”*

Panic clawed higher in my throat. I staggered through the hall, into the kitchen, grabbing at the back door. The knob twisted beneath my palm, but the same click followed - the wood tightening as if bracing itself to hold me in.

A shape caught my eye - motion at the window.

I turned.

Across the yard, my neighbor was stepping from his porch, stiff and deliberate, eyes fixed on me. Then another, and another. They crossed the lawn without a sound, gathering along my house.

They pressed themselves to the windows.

Every one of them.

Palms spread flat. Faces leaned close, cheek to pane. Their eyes stared through at me, unblinking, catching the faint light in strange reflections that looked too bright, too wet.

A dozen mouths moved at once, muffled by the glass, whispering things I couldn’t make out, but all of them smiling, all of them watching.

The whispers overlapped, swelled, some voices turning sharp, almost scolding

*“Stop it. Stop it.”*

*“Our lord won’t be happy with you.”*

Others curled into a cloying sing-song, 

*“Don’t worry, sweetheart. You’re safe here. We’ll take care of you.”*

The house vibrated with it, the glass humming faintly as their breath fogged the panes. Smiles stretched too wide, too steady, splitting into snarls and croons.

I stumbled back, heart hammering, staring at the impossible wall of faces around me. Every window on the first floor was filled. I was sealed inside, trapped in my own house, their voices clawing at me from all directions.

Panic seized me. My eyes shot upward - the stairs. The bedroom.

I bolted, two steps at a time, my body lurching forward as if chased by the noise swelling below. I burst into my room, chest heaving, and grabbed at the curtain.

Outside: my car, parked at the curb. My only chance.

For a moment I froze, the chanting rising beneath me, swelling into something that wasn’t words anymore, just a pressure in my skull.

Then I drove my heel into the glass.

It shattered around me in an explosion of cold shards, the afternoon air slicing my face. Without another thought I hurled myself through, down onto the pavement.

The pain was immediate, white-hot, snapping through my leg like fire. My ankle folded under me with a sickening crack. I screamed, or thought I did - the sound drowned in the roar of blood in my ears.

I rolled onto my side, vision warping, breath hitching against the shock. The night smelled of iron and dust, my face wet where glass had sliced it.

*Move. Move.*

My car loomed just yards away, unreal and shining under the streetlight. I clawed across the lawn, dragging my useless leg, grass slick beneath my palms. Every shift of my weight sent agony screaming up my body, but the chanting from the house was louder now, echoing out through the broken window, their voices a chorus spilling into the night:

“Come back.”

“You’re safe with us.”

“Don’t run.”

“He is waiting for you.”

I hit the curb, fumbling at my pocket, keys slick with blood. Somehow I got them into the lock. Somehow I turned. The handle gave, and I dragged myself inside, collapsing against the steering wheel, gasping, the horn blaring once in a long, muffled note.

The house behind me pulsed with voices, calling, pleading, demanding.

Then the sound changed. No longer steady, no longer coaxing - it broke apart. Ragged sobs, hiccupping wails, voices tearing themselves raw. Some keened like children. Others moaned low and guttural, as though their throats were splitting under the strain.

And their mouths - God, their mouths. Lips quivering, stretching too wide, some grinning, some crumpled into masks of grief, every face vibrating with need. The voices overlapped until words were nothing but noise, then reassembled, jagged and broken:

*“Our lord needs you.”*

*“Our lord needs your body.”*

*“What will our lord do without you?”*

Some shrieked it high and thin, others crooned it like nursery songs, syllables slurring through their sobs. It was a chorus of grief, of hunger, of worship. A sound that didn’t belong in human throats.

The nearest neighbor pressed her face against the windshield, teeth bared in a rictus that was half a smile, half a sob. Her breath fogged the glass in frantic bursts, and she dragged her tongue across it, leaving a wet smear that ran down like tears.

*“Don’t leave us.”*

*“Don’t leave him.”*

*“Don’t leave.”*

Their wailing rattled the street, a dirge swelling until it shook the engine itself.

I twisted the key - once, twice. My ankle throbbed like fire, the pain snapping my vision white, but I forced it again. The engine coughed, sputtered - then roared.

As I slammed the pedal, the car lurched forward, wheels thudding over bodies that broke apart too easily, like brittle effigies stuffed with wet leaves.

In the rearview mirror they collapsed to their knees, clawing at the pavement, arms outstretched, their cries echoing after me: not anger, not threat. 

Just a howling, endless grief.

I didn’t stop driving until the houses thinned, until the highway signs gave way to the smear of city lights. Every throb of my ankle was a reminder that I wasn’t dreaming. I pushed until the tank hit red and found a cheap motel off the interstate, the kind with buzzing neon and a clerk who didn’t bother to look up.

For three nights I barely slept. Curtains drawn tight, TV humming low. Every time I closed my eyes I saw the glass, the mouths, the way their palms pressed against me like the house itself was breathing. I lived off vending machine snacks and the emergency cash I’d crammed in my glovebox months ago and forgotten.

On the fourth morning I couldn’t stand it anymore. My leg was swollen purple, every nerve screaming, and I knew I had to tell someone. Anyone.

The police station was fluorescent and humming, antiseptic in a way that almost calmed me. I stood at the counter, swaying on my good foot, and when the officer asked what was wrong, the words tumbled out.

“There were people, they - they were at my house, they wouldn’t let me leave, they knew my name, they said things about a lord, I think they wanted to sacrifice me to it, they-”

My voice broke. I gripped the counter, knuckles white, trying to steady my breath. The officer gave me that look, the careful, measured one they must practice for drunks and lunatics.

And then my gaze drifted - just for a moment - to the badge on his chest.

And I froze.

The badge gleamed under the light, sharper than it should, every line too clear.

I’d seen them before. Hell, maybe this one had always been like that. But looking at it now, it seemed wrong - too perfect, too deliberate, each point cutting the air like a blade.

“…Was it…” My throat closed. I forced the words out.

*“…Was it always a seven-pointed star?”*",1,1755772213.0,u_metadalf,0,1.0,False

1mw76am,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTAppsEngine/comments/1mw76am/were_living_the_scifi_dream_how_ai_automation_is/,🚀 We’re LIVING the Sci-Fi Dream: How AI Automation Is Rewriting Our Daily Lives—Are You Ready for the Next Level?,"Have you all noticed how AI automation is absolutely *booming* lately? It's not just big tech companies anymore—it's reaching right into our homes and daily workflows. From scheduling our meetings while we sleep to auto-coding basic websites, things are changing FAST. 

Is anyone else excited that... honestly, we're *living in the future*?!

Let’s talk about why this is awesome and maybe a *little* intimidating:

• **🛠️ Productivity on Steroids:**  
No more tedious copy-paste sessions! AI automates repetitive tasks, leaving us with brainpower to focus on the creative and complex problems that actually get us excited. Writers, developers, artists—you name it! Everyone can offload their “boring stuff” and chase new ideas.

• **🌐 Access for All:**  
You don’t have to be a coding genius to set up automated workflows. Low-code AI platforms and integrations mean everyone from students to stay-at-home parents can build something cool to solve their unique challenges.

• **📈 Speed Speed Speed:**  
What took hours before can now be done in minutes. It’s so uplifting to finish your work early and still have time for a walk, or a fresh pot of coffee… or both. 😄

But okay, let’s be real—exciting as it is, AI automation can be a mixed bag. There's that worry: will we all be *replaced* by our own creations? Or, maybe, are we actually unlocking new levels of achievement and moving up the value chain?

Here’s what I’m noticing:

- Work is changing, not disappearing.  
  The need for creativity, empathy, and lateral thinking is skyrocketing! AI automation makes “busy work” a thing of the past, letting humans focus where we’re strongest.
  
- The barrier to entrepreneurship is dropping.  
  You can launch a micro-business in a weekend! Build, ship, test. Even just for fun, it feels so encouraging to try.

- Even if AI takes some jobs, it’s also creating new ones—the “prompt engineering” skills I see popping up alone are a testament!

Does all this make me happy? *Absolutely.*  
But I’m also aware that we need to make thoughtful decisions as automation spreads. How do we retrain, upskill, and ensure everyone feels empowered, not “automated out?”

I’d love to hear:  
• What little (or big!) automation win has brought a huge smile to your face recently?  
• Are you more excited or anxious about AI automation, and why?  
• What do you wish existed in the world of AI workflow tools?

Let’s celebrate how AI automation unlocks new levels of happiness and creativity—while also getting real about the challenges ahead. Bring your positive stories, *tough questions*, and wildest ideas below! 🚀",1,1755772147.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

1mw75ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1mw75ao/new_school_new_crush/,New school new crush,"I moved schools not long ago and there’s that one girl that caught my eyes. I moved with two of my best friends and we know some people so it’s not that awkward.

That girl is not in the same grade as me, and every time I see her walking in the hallway or at lunch she always looks at me. Once I was sitting drinking coffee with my friends and I notice her side eyeing me, and then instantly looked away when I noticed.

However what I am worried about it how old she is. She is definitely younger than me and much shorter than me, which does concern me because I am a short guy (1.74/5’9). And also I heard that people in this school judge a lot, and I mean A LOT. 

What should I do? I’m a bit scared approaching her, but maybe I can somehow find her instagram.

What do you people think I should do????",1,1755772050.0,Crush,0,1.0,False
