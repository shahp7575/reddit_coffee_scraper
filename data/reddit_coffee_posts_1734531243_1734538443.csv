1hh4sv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1hh4sv6/pots_and_pornographymasturbation/,POTS and Pornography/Masturbation ,"after living for years of POTS and being diagnosed I have decided to write this thread with my experience and see if other people have same experience or some symptoms I have.  

in my personal experience I think I have pots since I was like 15yo (now 32)yM. 

I always had mild symptoms never fainted or be light headed and only for a year realised my Heart rate is going up when I stand and after I eat ( the increased hr after eating is only for 1 year now that I know of)

I only had palpitations and feeling weird after eating and standing up, I sometimes feel hot ( especially in the evening) or cold ( if I don t eat) also somehow my POTS is related to my ears - I had ear fullness and sometimes when I had a flare up I heard and felt my  pulse in the ears after climbing stairs ( It is strange I do not have high BP) I have also constant Tinnitus which is most of the time mild and only high when I m tired or stressed.

My biggest episodes were triggered in aug 2023 by a anxiety attack when I had problems with my wife and I tried to use marijuana for anxiety which made it much worse - ( I only used it 2 times) 

At the time I had no Idea I have pots I always drank coffee, and drank a little of alcohol but everything seemed fine.

after I solved my anxiety problems and for more than half a year I had no anxiety whatsoever I noticed my HR was not going down as it was supposed to be normal and I realised It could be pots, initially I was thinking it might be inappropriate tachycardia syndrome. (my hr now is around 90-95 when standing on an empty stomach on a good day and fluctuates to 100-110-115 rarely and around 90-95 to 130-135 after eating and standing up or climbing 2 flights of stairs)

after a few months of medications and complete lifestyle change and diet I am much better day by day and my palpitations were reduced to >95% and now I barely realise sometimes I have them.

My theory is that my POTS might be organic and not genetic and I think it could be the result of 18 years of struggle with masturbation and pornography. It also affected my emotional side and even if I have exciting or good news I tend to have high HR.  

I have done so much research on this and red books about how pornography influences the brain and I concluded this is mainly the reason why I have POTS. Pornography is such a bad thing people use and think it might be beneficial but from what I red and I believe it is a poison for mind and body and combined with masturbation can lead to a lot of harm. I personally experience massive heart rate of 150-160 after orgasm, also very rarely I had very bad migraine all day after masturbating like 2-3 times in the morning.

1 year ago I decided I have to stop watching pornography and masturbate which I did even it was very hard the first 3-6 months and once or 2 times a month I have gave up and did it once or twice but I got back and fought and the longest period of abstinence was 3-4 months ( I have forgot to count) because I also lost interest in counting the abstinence period. after a big struggle I can positively affirm that I am porn free after all this years and even I know I might have a time when I can fall I will never get back to it and I will always fight it. The benefits are numerous and the Rewarding System has reset I can naturally laugh and enjoy life my Brain Clarity has improved , stamina mood etc.

What I can reassure people is that pornography and masturbation is very bad for long term is it like a poison that you slowly drink even short term is very bad and the best scenario  to have a healthy sexual relationship with one person and if possible get married and be faithful because this is how things are naturally supposed to be and will save us a lot of pain and whoever has POTS understands.

It was just sort of dark and sad back there and the front is really pretty and just felt a bit more lively.

They brought out complimentary ros√© which was lovely. I ordered the cherry cola cocktail (which tasted like flat pop which I enjoyed!) and my boyfriend ordered a great Pinot noir. We started with the frito misto (SO GOOD). The side sauce was divine and I don‚Äôt even know what it was.

I can look at options in Khao Yai but considering I don't need to be anywhere near any landmark or place of note, maybe someone has some relative out of the box ideas. There needs to be nature, but it doesn't need to be near a park or any tourist hotspot or natural landmark. Just a lot of trees are fine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think about a bright smile, professional teeth whitening often comes to mind. The transformation it provides can be stunning, affecting not only your appearance but also your confidence and overall self-esteem. The process delivers compelling results that many people desire, leading them to seek out this popular dental treatment.

Before embarking on a teeth whitening journey, many individuals have questions about what to expect. The ‚Äòbefore‚Äô state typically involves teeth that may appear discolored, stained, or dull. Various factors contribute to this issue, including:

- **Diet:** Certain foods and beverages like coffee, tea, red wine, and berries can lead to staining over time.
- **Tobacco Use:** Smoking or chewing tobacco can leave significant marks on your teeth.
- **Aging:** As you age, the enamel on your teeth wears down, revealing a yellower dentin beneath.
- **Dental Care:** Irregular brushing and flossing may result in plaque buildup, which contributes to discoloration.

These factors leave many individuals feeling self-conscious about their smiles. However, with professional teeth whitening, this problem can often be corrected, leading to dazzling ‚Äòafter‚Äô results that make a remarkable difference.

The professional teeth whitening procedure usually begins with a consultation. During this time, your dental professional will evaluate the current state of your teeth and discuss your whitening goals. Depending on your needs, they may recommend different whitening methods, such as:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method involves applying a high-concentration bleaching solution directly to your teeth under controlled conditions, often giving immediate results in just one visit.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits may include custom trays and lower-concentration whitening gels for a more gradual whitening process, which can be more convenient for some patients.

The procedure generally takes around one to two hours for in-office treatments, or you can spend a couple of weeks with at-home kits, following your dentist‚Äôs instructions. Many patients experience noticeable differences even after their first session, showcasing significant transformations in the appearance of their smiles.

After the whitening treatment, the ‚Äòafter‚Äô results can be nothing short of extraordinary. Many individuals notice a brighter, whiter shade to their teeth‚Äîoften several shades lighter than before. Here are some benefits you can expect from professional teeth whitening:

- **Boosted Confidence:** A bright smile can enhance your self-esteem, allowing you to engage more freely in social situations.

Understanding the Safety and Effectiveness of Teeth Whitening Treatments
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bright, white teeth are often seen as a symbol of beauty and health. As a result, many people consider professional teeth whitening treatments to achieve this ideal smile. But how safe and effective are these treatments? Here, we'll explore vital aspects you should know before deciding to whiten your teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding Teeth Whitening Treatments

Teeth whitening typically falls into two main categories: in-office treatments and at-home kits. In-office whitening, performed by dental professionals, uses powerful agents that yield quicker results. On the other hand, at-home kits, available over the counter, offer a more gradual whitening approach. While both methods can significantly improve the color of your teeth, their safety and effectiveness vary.

### Safety Factors to Consider

When choosing a teeth whitening treatment, safety is a major concern for many. Here are some important factors to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Professional Guidance:** It's essential to consult with a dentist before starting any whitening treatment. A dental professional can assess the condition of your teeth and recommend the safest option.
- **Approved Products:** Look for products that are approved by dental associations or regulatory bodies. These products have been tested for safety and efficacy.
- **Dental Health:** Individuals with existing dental issues, such as cavities or gum disease, should address these problems before whitening. Treatment could lead to increased sensitivity or pain if underlying conditions exist.
- **Potential Side Effects:** Some common side effects of teeth whitening include tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. These symptoms usually subside shortly after treatment.

### Effectiveness of Treatments

The effectiveness of teeth whitening treatments can be impressive, but it varies based on several factors:

- **Original Tooth Color:** The natural shade of your teeth plays a significant role in the final results. If your teeth are naturally dark or stained, it may take longer to see significant improvements.
- **Type of Treatment:** In-office treatments usually offer quicker and more dramatic results compared to at-home kits. Professional whitening can lighten teeth several shades in just one visit.
- **Duration of Treatment:** Following the recommended treatment duration is vital. In-office sessions may last about an hour, while at-home kits could require daily use for a few weeks.
- **Maintenance Post-Whitening:** Maintaining your bright smile involves good oral hygiene and possibly touch-up treatments. Avoiding foods and beverages that stain teeth, such as coffee and red wine, is also beneficial.

### Long-Term Results

When you opt for professional teeth whitening, it's crucial to have realistic expectations. While results can last several months to years, several factors will influence this longevity:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Personal Habits:** Your lifestyle choices, such as smoking or frequent consumption of staining foods and drinks, will impact the duration of your whitening effects.
- **Routine Maintenance:** Regular dental cleanings and follow-up whitening treatments can help maintain the brightness of your smile.
- **Age and Genetics:** As we age, the structure of our teeth changes, which can influence how they respond to whitening treatments.

### Alternative Whitening Methods

If you're concerned about the potential risks associated with professional whitening, consider these alternative methods:

- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These products contain mild abrasives and special chemicals to help remove surface stains. They are less effective than professional treatments but can aid with maintenance.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people turn to baking soda or hydrogen peroxide. While these methods may provide slight improvements, it's crucial to use them cautiously to avoid damaging your enamel.
- **Diet Adjustments:** crunchy fruits and vegetables can help in naturally scrubbing surfaces and preventing stains.

Understanding the safety and effectiveness of teeth whitening treatments is essential before you decide to proceed. Consulting with a dentist is the best first step, ensuring you choose the method that suits your needs and maintains the health of your teeth and gums. With the right approach, you can achieve the vibrant, confident smile you desire.

### Conclusion

Achieving a bright, white smile can significantly enhance your confidence and overall appearance. The transformations seen in before and after images of professional teeth whitening serve as powerful testimonials to the effectiveness of these treatments. Many individuals experience a noticeable change, often shedding years off their smile and boosting their self-esteem in social and professional settings.

Safety is paramount when it comes to teeth whitening. Professional treatments are designed to be not only effective but also safe for your dental health. Dental professionals use regulated products and techniques that minimize risks, ensuring that you achieve the desired results without compromising the integrity of your teeth or gums. The careful assessment of your dental condition beforehand guarantees that any treatment is tailored to your unique needs.

A commitment to oral health should accompany any cosmetic journey. Post-treatment care, including maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dentist visits, can help prolong the effects of whitening, keeping your smile radiant for years to come. It‚Äôs important to note that while professional teeth whitening can yield impressive results, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and reducing habits like smoking or excessive coffee drinking will contribute to long-lasting brightness.

This is going to be a long one so buckle up‚Ä¶ I have spoken to friends about this over the span of 6yrs but I feel like I need some advice from strangers on the internet lol. So I 20F met this guy we‚Äôll call him Adam 21M back in my freshman year of high school and he was a sophomore. I was getting my volunteer hours filming for the school football team and he was a player. We exchanged numbers, texted, late night phone calls, etc; I really thought things were going good and we were getting along exceptionally well. To my surprise a couple weeks in he had ended things for reasons at this point I do not remember. I started speaking to someone else who ended up being my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship however real it can be when you‚Äôre 14-15 yrs old. When Adam found out he decided to apologize and tell me he was sorry wanted a relationship with me etc. I had declined and we went quite awhile not speaking and avoiding each other in the halls. this lasted about a year and half when we connected again. Once again started chatting and had made plans to meet up, we ended up hooking up and it went radio silent on his end. Life moved on and about another year later we started speaking again made plans and hooked up and once again I was ghosted. I started making a joke of it to my friends that this was my annual hookup. He ended up getting into a pretty serious long-term relationship so I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in awhile but once they had ended their relationship he reached out to me again and we started talking and I‚Äôm sure from the pattern of where this is going you know what happened next, this one was different, we stayed the night, he made me coffee in the morning kept me around a little bit later into the afternoon and I had finally thought we were going somewhere and that this time he really liked me like this time and where my dumbass thought he was going to sweep me off my feet and ride into the sunset but once again I was ghosted. We hadn‚Äôt spoken for probably 5-6 months when he reached out to me again late this past August and we started chatting, I made a promise to myself I wouldn‚Äôt be so readily available and being in college I was pretty busy and had other things to occupy my time and mind but the chatting had went well and progressed. He asked me out for lunch by my school and we went out had good conversation and I finally felt like I was taking control of the narrative, until‚Ä¶ you guessed it, radio silence. I had decided to take a respectful approach this time and just messaged him thanking him for lunch and how lovely it was catching up and I hope everything was alright. He had reached back out about day later explaining to me he was basically hung up on his ex (a different girl) and how she was practically harassing him at his place of work bringing in the guy she had cheated on him with. I tried to be reassuring and encouraging telling him this girl was clearly trying to get a reaction out of him and for him to ignore it but had put the timeline together and since that lovely morning we had together to him reaching out again, he had gotten himself a new girlfriend.

1hh4brx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hh4brx/why_i_hate_christmas_again/,Why I hate christmas again,"I hate complaining but I feel I need to do this or else I will just pop.

When I was 15 I moved to my father because my mother was physically and mentally abusive. My sister decided to stay with our mother and become a walking early 2000s talk show setlist but that's a story of its own. My father's partner moved in with him and brought her own children. I will call them my parents later on. Other than in some blogs we mixed pretty well as a patchwork family and while not 100% harmonious we did well.

Christmas became surprisingly good for me. In my previous living situation, it was the time when you had to be especially careful or else you got yelled at and beaten with household utensils. If you cleaned your room ""wrong"" you got a beating and were sent away so my mother could clean it the ""right"" way and go through your stuff. Christmas changed after moving. Preparations were a lot more relaxed and there was no shouting or beating. Christmas eve had a program now that was not just about food and presence. After my father's partner and her children returned from church we would enter the room with the present and the tree and before opening them there would be cards from family friends been read, one always sends a Christmas story that is also read, and then one of the children was to give the presents to everyone. After all the presents were opened and some talking, there was food and games. On the second day, we would have breakfast together and then everyone did their own thing until we met in the afternoon to visit a restaurant. A little corny but I liked it very much and developed the ""I like Christmas not for the gifts but for spending time with my family"" mentality.

During adulthood, some dynamics changed and some people moved away or became more nomadic. I got diagnosed with depression and went into therapy, I do way better but the sessional variation clings to me like dogshit. and I went back to hating Christmas again. I never really understood why until this year.

I feel invisible.

Around six years ago I was diagnosed with an unfortunate combination of allergies. Cow Milk protein, chicken protein ( the meat and the egg) and soy. I don't balloon or choke, but I will have incredibly painful colics and get ""drunk"" meaning I do lose orientation, self-preservation, and the ability to make safe decision making. Driving is one of the worst things I could do in this situation. After it sank in I could not eat in a normal restaurant or cafe my parents completely stopped calling me up to go to drink a coffee or tea, something that we did at least once a month before. When I visit them during dinner time, I either get some tomatoes with red onions, oil and vinegar, or nothing at all because they have nothing in the house for me. In the six years, my godmother finds a new dish I can eat every week when I visit her, the only remembered that I can eat a certain kind of hot dog brand and that's it. They have smartphones and access to the internet. They can visit the same sides as I do and are still asking what my allergies are. This Christmas is the first time the looked into which restaurant I can visit. Still, I have yet to call the restaurant and talk with them about my allergies. My friends keep my allergies in mind and even cook for me separately. Our secretary at work makes sure the Christmas treats I get are stuff I can eat and even almost threw herself between me and our new boss because he was about to give me the wrong parcel.

I tried to invite them to dinner at my house, cook for them or just talk over coffee/tea it worked two times when they showed up with my niece. And it is not that they do this with the other's as well. I often hear how my sister had dinner with them so much that they got annoyed because she wanted bbq and it was exploding their food bill. They talk how they went by or met the others with their families and had tea or coffee, and visited an exhibition. Months later I get to hear: ""We thought you might have liked it too."" But it's not that they call me in time when it's still open.

This year was especially bad for me.

Two years ago I was diagnosed with endometriosis in addition to my already established pcos. I got told if I want children I should be fast about it. The thing is I do want one. I am an aromatic asexual, so I have no idea what even to do with a partner but I do want to be a mother. Not just a mother but a good mother, that's one of the reasons I went to therapy for so long. I found a fertility clinic and a sperm bank that had a donor and put away money for three treatments. I have to pay for all of this out of pocket since I am not married. After three failed inseminations we moved to IVF, off which I could afford 1 treatment. I had already massively overspent on my initial savings and the prognosis of: Well it does look all well and should go pretty good with you. no longer inspired optimism. During the IVF treatment, I learned that even with a partner I would need IVF to conceive. And on the day one of five possible eggs was scheduled to be implanted, I got a call that all of them had stagnated in their development and none was viable. My parents were the only one in the family that knew I was on this journey and I called my father that this last attempt had failed and I would not have children. It was a short call in which he told me he was sorry and had been excited for the baby. and maybe we both had been a little bit too excited. And that's it. His partner called the next day to tell me how sad she was about this. Which was fine and I was grateful for nut than came the solutions: When I was done grieving I could find something else to put my energy in. Followed by a list of things I have 0 interest in or I already am doing and this gem: ""You could voluntarily work at a counselling hotline and help people with real problems.""

It's like they stopped listening to me years ago. They did not realize I am in no pictures until I told them and then they were shocked. Most interactions are initiated by me. 'Hey, this movie came out and is not shit. Do you want to see it?' Two months after the failed IVF treatment I got 1 message where I was asked how I am doing and when I answered that I did not good I got the answer. ""Still?"" They are radio silent until I met up with them and then they show me pictures of their grandchildren and all the things they are up to. And when I try to tell them I could need some help they look at me with this pitied look and tell me about the things I could do to make me feel better. ( What about adoption? Did you start therapy again? Well then I don't know either.)

I have friends who do care and ask about me but it just hurt that my family seems to forget about me at every twist and turn. I had no good months this year. Nothing feels as it should. I should have or prepare to have a child. I should not randomly start to cry during every hour of the day, have spurs of insomnia, spiked blood pressure and depression. And next week the same people who can be there for the family members who are loud and healthy will sit around reading a Christmas story about caring for each other and charity.

Here is the beginning of a new story of mine. Any and all feedback welcome please. ","When I was in my late twenties, I would go through the morning newspaper, search the obituaries, and attend the funerals of strangers in my neighborhood. That wasn‚Äôt a regular hobby for me, certainly not something I‚Äôd ever done before, but I was sort of unemployed and bored and sad and running out of free things to do. In that economy, the only other free activity is running, and it was too cold for that. Plus, running makes me too hungry, and I didn‚Äôt have enough money for any extra hunger. 

Needless to say, I was in a weird spot. It was near the end of this very strange, year long period of my life, at one of these funerals, where I met Pete. 
It was a Saturday morning in February. Thirty degrees and snowing, one of those bleak days where it looked like someone went outside and turned the saturation down. I was attending a funeral in my neighborhood of some doctor that passed away from a heart attack. He was only 41. 

There, in the dark, back left corner of St. Anthony‚Äôs Cathedral, a young man slid into the empty pew behind me. Nobody else was in the back, say, 15 rows. Except for me, of course. 


When the priest instructed the mourners and me to open up to hymn 473, I heard a soft, low voice behind me. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you coming to some of these funerals,‚Äù he said, with an accent I couldn‚Äôt quite decipher yet.


Nothing in life surprises me, and strangers don‚Äôt scare me. I was hungry for conversation, for anything. So I whispered right back, ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù


 He had a commanding and slightly alluring presence. He signaled to me to lean in closer for a whisper, and I did it. 

‚ÄúYou vibrate on a strange frequency‚Äù he said, in a quiet but playful voice.

I smiled. It feels good to be recognised, even by strangers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúWhat are you doing at this funeral?‚Äù he said. I could tell now, the accent. He was Irish.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing at this funeral?‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúWould you like to go for a drink?‚Äù he said.

I shrugged. ‚ÄúOkay, if you‚Äôre buying,‚Äù Like I said before, strangers don‚Äôt scare me, and I was in no place to turn down a free drink. Or a free anything, for that matter. 

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said. 

So we left the funeral early and Pete led the way out of the Cathedral and through the freezing rain to a pub just across the street. We sat in a corner booth by the window. Not many people were in there, it being early on Saturday morning and all. I‚Äôm not sure if this really counted as a date, but I hadn‚Äôt been on one in a while.


Pete broke the silence. ‚ÄúSo what do you do for work?‚Äù he asked. It‚Äôs like his accent strengthened upon entrance into the Irish Pub. 

I took a swig of my beer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNot right now, at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, I work in a coffee shop a few days a week. But I don‚Äôt have, like, a real job.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo they pay you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù
‚ÄúSounds like a real job to me,‚Äù he said, bringing his beer to his lips. This made me feel a little better. I am always looking to feel a little better. 

‚ÄúSo what do you do?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a‚Ä¶taxidermist,‚Äù he said with an expression that recognized the bizarre nature of his profession. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù I said, and I was smiling and I couldn‚Äôt help it. He was decent looking and somewhat interesting and was buying me a beer. This was the best thing to happen to me in months.

	‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs weird,‚Äù Pete laughed. ‚ÄúBut someone‚Äôs got to do it! It‚Äôs sort of,‚Äù he paused and looked at me intently, ‚ÄúA family business type thing.‚Äù 

	I nodded. ‚ÄúSo your family, they‚Äôve moved here to the United States?‚Äù

	‚ÄúNo, they‚Äôre still in Ireland.‚Äù

	I raised my eyebrows. ‚ÄúThen what are you doing here?‚Äù

	‚ÄúSo how come you get to ask all the questions then?‚Äù he bargained with a smile. 

	‚ÄúAlright, that‚Äôs fair. Let‚Äôs talk about something else,‚Äù I suggested. 

‚ÄúGood idea,‚Äù Pete said. ‚ÄúWant another one?‚Äù he asked, pointing at my beer. 

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I said. Which is sort of the mantra of my life. 

He returned with two more beers. ‚ÄúWhat do you do when you‚Äôre not sitting at funerals?‚Äù he asked. 

	‚ÄúI read, mostly.‚Äù 

	‚ÄúAnd what are you reading now?‚Äù 

	‚ÄúMoby Dick,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOr re-reading it, actually.‚Äù 

	‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious.‚Äù 

	‚Äú I am,‚Äù I said. I pulled out my worn copy out of my tote bag. It was tearing at the edges and had yellow post-it notes sticking out of the sides. I stole this copy from the university library where I worked back in college. I learned early on, insteading of buying my books new, just take them from the library. That way, some other students have already highlighted or underlined the important parts. You just had to trust that they were smart enough to know what they were doing. I always did. I trust just about everybody.
 ‚ÄúMy favorite professor in college told me that you can‚Äôt go to heaven unless you‚Äôve read Moby Dick.‚Äù I told him. 

	He raised his eyebrows but did not reply, so I filled the silence. ‚ÄúNot that I think I‚Äôm going to heaven, or anything,‚Äù I added.

	His eyes lit up with attention, ‚ÄúSo you aren‚Äôt very religious, then?‚Äù 

	‚ÄúOh, the heaven thing? I don‚Äôt know. It might be real, I just meant I‚Äôm not sure if I am going. If I had to put money on it, I would say it‚Äôs not real and none of us are going anywhere. But I dunno. It was just a little joke about Moby Dick.‚Äù 

	He interrupted. ‚ÄúRight, but I just met you in a church, so I assumed you were the religious type. But I guess I was wrong?‚Äù 

	‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre not all the way wrong. I grew up going to Catholic school, and my family was religious in the traditional sense, you know, we went to church and all that. Although I‚Äôve never really personally believed in God.‚Äù This was true. 

Pete was nodding slowly, trying to figure me out. ‚ÄúI understand. I‚Äôm not a firm believer in Jesus Christ myself‚Ä¶But this professor of yours,‚Äù  Pete said, changing the subject, ‚Äúhe seems like a real know-it-all.‚Äù

I was glad to switch topics. ‚ÄúOh he is! And that is the best part about him. He literally knew everything there is to know about English Literature. I‚Äôve never met a more consistent person in my life. He wore a tweed jacket and a bowtie every single day. Never used a powerpoint or wrote on the board or anything like that. Just came in with an annotated copy of the book we were reading and one singular piece of handwritten notes of the topics he wanted to talk about. His classes were like a book club,‚Äù I paused, catching my breath. I could feel myself grinning.

 ‚ÄúLike a really, really expensive book club. And he had to clear his throat every forty five seconds and sometimes he coughed so hard I thought he might peel over and die. But damn, he was smart. If I could do anything in this world, I would attend his class once a week for the rest of my life.‚Äù

Pete smiled at my enthusiasm. ‚ÄúWow, that sounds amazing. What was his name?‚Äù 

‚ÄúDr. Grammar.‚Äù I said. 

Pete laughed. ‚ÄúSeems fitting,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù I said. 

We both paused to sip on our beers. I looked out the window. The freezing rain had turned into snow and it came down hard and fast and sideways and I realized I was definitely a little tipsy and started eating the free peanuts from the small bowl in the middle of the table. It doesn‚Äôt take much to get me drunk, especially when all I‚Äôve been eating for the last few days were scrambled eggs and ramen noodles. 

‚ÄúTell me now, would I like that Dr. Grammar of yours?‚Äù Pete asked me. 

‚ÄúHis classes weren‚Äôt for everyone. But it‚Äôs hard to say,‚Äù I said, in between peanuts. ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt really know you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want to know?‚Äù he questioned.

‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù I asked, squinting my eyes a bit, 

‚ÄúWhy are any of us here?‚Äù he deflected, and raised his hands up and tilted his head toward the sky, trying to get a laugh out of me.

I think there's some unspoken rule about how much one can eat of those free bar snacks, or at least the rate at which you consume them in order to remain polite, but I didn‚Äôt really care. I was hungry. And I wasn‚Äôt trying to impress him, necessarily. But then again, what was I doing? In that pub? At those funerals? Here on planet earth? 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, but you know what I meant. Why are you here, in the United States, here in Philly? Here at that funeral?‚Äù I nodded my head in the direction of the church. 

‚ÄúAlright, alright. I‚Äôm here doing a bit of research for scientific projects related to my profession.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs conveniently vague,‚Äù I said.

He quickly replied. ‚ÄúAnd so are you!‚Äù

‚ÄúNot true. I gave you that whole spiel about my English class.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo? You‚Äôre a bit of a nerd, that‚Äôs all you‚Äôve told me. I want to know why you‚Äôve been going to the funerals. If you tell me that, then I‚Äôll tell you more about me.‚Äù

	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I rubbed my eyes, which is something I do when I‚Äôm embarrassed. Sometimes, you don‚Äôt know how you feel until you're a little drunk and finally have someone's undivided attention and your words start speaking for themselves. 

‚ÄúI guess I don‚Äôt have many friends here in the city anymore, you know. Everyone‚Äôs moved to the suburbs with their fiances or busy practicing law or taking their kids to soccer practice and I‚Äôm still here and,‚Äù I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúIt's  just lonely, I guess. And I don‚Äôt want to go to mass because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Doesn‚Äôt feel good. Doesn‚Äôt feel right. ‚Äù 
I paused. 
‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt sit around by myself anymore. I need to be around some other people, even if they‚Äôre all sad. At least I know funerals are real, you know? I don't believe that Jesus died. Not for my sins, not for me. But I do know that the Doctor from this morning died. I know because I watched his wife cry at the podium.‚Äù I let out a big sigh, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but it comforts me, knowing that death is consistent and its threat is ever present and its effects are eternal, and none of us can escape it. It‚Äôs the only thing we have in common. It‚Äôs the common denominator for us all.‚Äù 

	‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Pete looked a bit shocked by my honesty, as was I.

‚ÄúSo you think I‚Äôm a freak now?‚Äù I asked. 

‚ÄúSo what? You‚Äôre a bit,‚Äù he held his thumb and his index finger close together to demonstrate, ‚Äúmore fucked up than I thought, but you‚Äôre no worse than me,‚Äù he said.

	‚ÄúI sort of doubt that,‚Äù I said, looking up from my beer.

	‚ÄúMaybe I can help you feel less lonely,‚Äù he said softly, his eyes searching mine.

I noticed the sudden shift of intimacy. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I was unsure what to make of his gesture.

He hesitated for a moment, as if debating whether to share something personal. He was whispering again, even though nobody was in the place now except  us and the bartenders. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be honest with you now. More honest, I mean. I have a unique profession,‚Äù he began carefully. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just a taxidermist.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat else do you do?‚Äù

He took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI specialize in human preservation,‚Äù he confessed quietly. ‚ÄúIt's an unconventional field, but that‚Äôs what I do.‚Äù

I leaned back slightly, processing his words. ‚ÄúHuman preservation? What, like... preserving dead bodies?‚Äù
His revelation hung in the air between us, heavy with implications. What was I doing? Who is this guy? 

Pete nodded, his expression serious yet strangely earnest. ‚ÄúExactly. Sometimes, I'm hired to preserve the bodies of loved ones, as a way for families to keep memories alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, are you saying you were hired to preserve the doctor from this morning?‚Äù I asked.

Pete's eyes softened with understanding. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúIt was his dying wish. He wanted to be preserved, to remain a part of this world in some way.‚Äù

I was taken aback. ‚ÄúDid you know him?‚Äù

He nodded again. ‚ÄúWell yeah, Dr. Taylor‚Äôs a client. Sometimes the client themself will request my treatment in their living will, sometimes the family requests it after their loved ones pass. Either way, I always go to the funeral, just to get a better idea of who this person is, or‚Ä¶I'm sorry,‚Äù he paused and corrected himself, ‚Äúwas.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù I was dumbfounded, ‚Äúbut how does this work?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the family is unaware of a client's request, I have to stay behind and talk to the next of kin, tell them who I am and what I do and that I now have legal ownership of the remains of their loved ones and a responsibility to carry out my process. It can get messy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I can imagine.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo this Doctor Taylor,‚Äù it felt weird saying his name. Suddenly, his death didn‚Äôt feel as comforting as it had before, ‚Äúhis wife knew what was going to happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, Dr. Taylor contacted me years and years ago, right when all of this medical preservation stuff was just starting to break through. He gave me a cash advance and we signed a couple of contracts and that was that. Then just a few days ago, his estate lawyer called me as soon as he died and I was on the next flight out of Ireland. Pretty standard case.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo you just travel wherever death takes you then?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHuman preservation isn‚Äôt quite legal everywhere. Even in the EU, the legality isn‚Äôt uniform throughout. Here in America, it‚Äôs only legal in Pennsylvania and New York. Client‚Äôs gotta be a resident of one of these states at the time of death. So, obviously, I go to a lot of funerals here in Philadelphia. I always sit in the back, so I don‚Äôt make a scene, and I‚Äôve seen you at a few over the last few months. The first two, I thought it was just a coincidence. But seeing you today, I knew it had to be something else.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust those two states? Nowhere else in America?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the two. Down there in the confederate states, it‚Äôs definitely not legal. You know how they are down there,‚Äù he said, chuckling. ‚ÄúCan you imagine?‚Äù 

A southerner myself, I was offended. Had he been this pretentious the whole time? ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt call them the confederate states, anymore, by the way. And to be honest, no. I don‚Äôt know what you meant by that.‚Äù 

He attempted an American, southern accent, and I was annoyed when it turned out pretty good. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a redneck. I‚Äôll kiss my cousin, but human preservation‚Äôs backwards.‚Äù

I scoffed. ‚ÄúNot everyone down there is like that. Even so, I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôd disagree with them about the ethics of your career. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about it, honestly. I mean, death‚Ä¶ Death is supposed to be the end.‚Äù

	Pete definitely felt my shift in tone. The snow was falling heavier now.  He lowered his voice again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, that was insensitive. I understand your reservations about what I do. It‚Äôs not a profession that everyone can accept. But for some families, it provides comfort knowing that they can preserve the memory of their loved ones in a tangible way.‚Äù 

I shuddered at the thought of preserving a body and stuffing it like some sort of prized animal. Do these families prop it up? Keep it on the couch in the living room? Move it to  the dining room table for dinner? I wanted to ask, but I was afraid of what Pete might respond. I wasn‚Äôt ready for this to be anything other than hypothetical. 

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs my point. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to preserve anything after death. It just feels like you‚Äôre trying to play God.‚Äù I said. 

Pete looked at me for a long minute, drinking his beer and then half slamming it on the table. ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt believe in God, remember?‚Äù he reminded me. 

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. 

‚ÄúWhatever. How long are you here for?‚Äù 
‚ÄúThis project should take up the next week or so‚Äù
END FOR NOW


Other ideas: 
Why Irish ? Playing with the idea of the famine, his family made money preserving the pets of the really wealthy during the Irish famine or something?

Why doesn‚Äôt he move to Philly? He doesn‚Äôt want to be an American, she thinks he's ignorant and uneducated about American history, maybe they get in some literary argument about which country has better classic literature

He makes soo much money (the preservation process costs a ridiculous amount of money) to be able to travel back and forth, he likes his family and life in Ireland, but he‚Äôs never married bc his life is weird and always on the go

She's having a sort of famine herself - she‚Äôs hungry for friendship/companionship as well as physically hungry and broke, so she might start working for him to make some money?

However, I feel like the new muscle strain associated with melee combat may need a bit of tweaking (note that my opinion may change as I play more, and as a gamer I am unfamiliar with physical exercise, and that my only personal experience with muscle strain is a sore neck after staring at a screen for 14 hours a day).

Currently, it feels like muscle strain/exertion builds up pretty quickly regardless of fitness/strength. As it stands, it seems like the weapon skill has much more significance in determining how much effective combat you can have before your character starts slowing down. If this is the case, then it does mildly help professions that give levels into specific melee weapons, but some players may feel bottlenecked on their weapon choice so their combat doesn't get too sluggish too quickly.

Overall I don't mind this change as it provides another way to make your character naturally feel stronger as they become familiar with a weapon type and the muscle strain takes longer to accumulate. It even increases the risk factor during the early days as exertion/exhaustion/strain can be a deadly combo if you get too ambitious. However, I feel like fitness/strength levels should also have a more significant role in determining strain/wear-and-tear of your character as it personally feels like I'm gimped too early in the day compared to earlier builds (but I also understand how people may like this change! This is just my opinion).

While I am not 100% certain of all the factors that play into strain/exertion with melee combat, my one suggestion at this time would be to **incorporate fitness, strength, and weapon skill levels at different weightings to calculate muscle strain accumulation.** While weapon skill can still remain the dominant factor, I feel like lower-weighted contributions from your general physical stats can help mitigate the pain of using a new weapon type without devaluing the extra distance you can go with a ""preferred""/weapon type with a higher level. Perhaps heavier weapon classes can calculate more weight from strength, with lighter weapons being affected more by fitness (2-handers vs 1-handers)?

This is just my word spew while drinking my morning coffee before hopping back into another day of Zomboid.

I did tech work for a while and occasionally machines would be destined for the scrapyard. I salvaged some parts for other projects and made this air roaster. Maybe it can give inspiration to others.

-Welded aluminum frame w/ hole drilled through for the ""drum"" which is a modified flour sifter that sits on top of a mesh strainer for heat distribution.
-Cut and bent the vanes of the sifter to get the beans moving without getting pinched, this took some trial and error!
-Drive motor is a Mastrena brew module. I left the spindle on and just tapped it since I lack machining tools.
-Power supply is from a Cimbali M2 and added a DC speed controller 
-Heat is provided by a heat blower gun sitting under the frame

It can roast a half pound of beans at a time and chaff goes everywhere, the neighbors can definitely smell the coffee! Takes about 8-10 minutes to first crack and second will start about 3 minutes later and I switch to cooling a little bit into second crack.

It goes into some mason jars for a week or two and then is ready for brewing in my Cimbali M29 Select which is also Frankensteined a bit, that will be another post eventually!

I started Zep mid September. Stepping on the scale this morning I thought I was going to be disappointed again as I've been hovering just above hitting the 40 pound target since before thanksgiving. To be perfectly honest, I'm feeling some scale dysmorphia, because this journey has been so unlike any other time I've lost weight.

What's working:

* **Calorie deficit using the LoseIt app**. I'm not religious about tracking, but it's been important to make sure I'm getting enough protein and staying within 1000-1200 calories/day. I aim for at least 100g/day of protein
* **Water!** I start each day drinking at least 8-16 oz before coffee or breakfast.
* **Strength training /Walking** \- I work out 3x/week with a trainer for 30 minutes. I'm not a gym rat. I walk a few miles almost every day, and with the cold weather, I ordered a walking pad (downsized version of treadmill). It's coming today! I choose exercise that will be sustainable and easy to fit within my schedule.
* **Eat food that remembers where it came from** \- I have Hashi's, so was eating pretty clean prior to going on Zep (limited gluten, dairy, red meat). I steer clear of processed foods, only occasionally using protein shakes (vegan) or protein bars.
* **MagO7** has been a game changer around avoiding any issue with constipation
* **Way less alcohol** \- prior to starting Zep I was having one bourbon/ginger beer nightly. I switched to a non-alcoholic bourbon and only occasionally indulge in the real stuff. Definitely helps curb inflammation + I read alcohol can inhibit Zep from working as well.
* **Therapy + Journaling** \- both have helped me to retrain my brain around negative thinking and I'm learning more about my triggers, which used to lead to me using food to soothe or tamp down feelings. For the first time in a long time, I have certainty I will get to my goal. When I start to go down a darker path, I push myself to name 5 things that are working right now. This simple trick really helps me elevate mindset.
* **Advocating for what I need** \- I fired my endocrinologist who wasn't listening when I told her I needed to move up my dosage. My PCP took over my script, and my dose at 7.5 is working well again with less food noise.",7,1734534387.0,Zepbound,1,0.89,False

I moved to the city a while back and have been quite reluctant to go out on dates because everybody had warned me about the gold diggers and sugar babes. However, we all give in eventually.

I was quite intrigued. So, she randomly asked if we should go out on a date after like a week of random chit chat. I stopped thinking with my brain and started thinking with my dick. Met her. Still pretty. Suggested we should head to a cafe for a coffee date. Instead, she decided we should head to a pub. 15 mins in, I learn she's a beautician who hasn't cleared her 12th. Still understandable. 1 hour in, she helped herself with 10 vodka shots and a hookah. Without the basic decency to even ask me once. Midway through the date, I was slapping myself in my head. I tried to make conversation but she was more bothered about the shots being too hard. Her personality was polar opposite of her appearance. I'm way too disappointed with the shallow nature of the folks here. Once she was done with her drinks, she wanted to leave, which I was quite thankful for. Deleted and blocked her immediately. This was my first and last attempt to date in Delhi. If you're a decent guy with a respect for your hard earned money, don't go out with these gold diggers.

There are two people who i will be talking about.

I started this job back in late July, and it was just me and one therapist as this clinic opened in January of this year (2024). The other therapist is also the owner of the clinic, and she was great at first but I quickly realized what type of person I was going to be around. At the time of me being hired she was about 6-7 months pregnant, so I was aware that her maternity leave was on the horizon. By this time, the baby was predicted to be smaller than what the doctors were hoping, and per her words was told to stop drinking coffee, and to stop working out to potentially help the baby grow more.  She had informed me that she would be hiring two new therapists full time and I was happy about that because it meant that I would have a job while she was gone. With her that wasn't fully my issue, but all she does is try to embarrass me in front of patients. Ill give two different situations. 

1. One morning I decided to head to a different coffee shop than Dunkin, ask I had more time to spare than I usually do at 6:30AM. By this time, both of the I got my old favorites, and headed to work. She had asked me about the coffee, I told her I really enjoyed it and she said she would try it in the morning. I was kind of confused because, shes pregnant, but shes so small that no cashier would be able to tell unless you told her. Her patients all looked at her like she was out of her mind, and one even asked ""should you be drinking coffee?"" Valid question given the circumstances. ""I keep it under 200mg."" Another patient quickly asked what we were all thinking, ""How do you know that it's 200mg if you're not the one making it, and you have a medium cup?"" No answer. Alrighty. Well, the next morning she came in with a LARGE coffee from the same shop I mentioned earlier. Without saying a good morning, or a how are you, in a full room of patients she literally yells : ""GIRL, THIS COFFEE IS DISGUSTING I DONT KNOW WHY YOU SAID IT WAS GOOD, ITS SO GROSS AND ITS SOOOOOOOOOO EXPENSIVE, I HATE IT!."" I literally just didnt say a word, and stared at her for 30 seconds, and walked away. I had to stop myself from tellling her to shut the fuck up, it was 7 in the morning. Im barely functioning, and id much rather still be in my bed. 
2. The second time, was about a week later. I was online shopping for a new pair of Lululemon leggings. To note, I only buy one pair ever 2-4 years because a. their expensive, b. the quality allows them to last that long if you take care of them properly. She is a frequent shopper there, so I asked her what line of their leggings are her favorite, she told me, and then asked if I was going to get a pair and I just replied without thinking and said ""Im after paying them."" I knew I shouldn't have said it right after because in all truth how I go about purchasing them is nobodies business but my own. But, she wasted no time and said ""No, dont after pay them, if you cant afford it in one payment you cant afford them at all. After pay is the worst invention ever, its so stupid."" Again, in a room full of patients. And yes, the whole clinic was looking at her like she had two heads. 

Now.... first of all, I've had to stop myself numerous times during these incidents because I am known to rebuttal back usually, but of course us being in a professional setting I can't say what I want so I've just shut my mouth all together. Luckily shes now on leave until the end of January so that took some of the weight off my shoulders. 

The OTHER therapist has actually almost given me numerous brain aneurism. Fresh Grad right out of PT school. Graduated top of the class apparently. Late 20's. Great Resume, sounded promising. Well thats what it felt like at first. I was quickly proven wrong. My job as an Aid is to assist when needed/asked, keep up with laundry and cleaning, and turn over the beds once a patient is all set with one. Well since he got here in October hes done/managed to do the following: 

1. Put 3 patients on clearly dirty beds, even when the patient themselves protested that it looked like the bed was dirty. 
2. Blow his nose (like wet blow) and multiple patients have asked him if he was sick
3. Broke his portable desk, broke the printer, and broke the brand new laptop he was given at the start of his employment
4. Messed up scheduling people (literally not his job) and it took our admin almost 2 days to fix it, which means they had to call people and reschedule them. He refused to take responsibility for that so it made it seem as though the admin did it when they literally all were home for the day at the time of the incident 
5. Creates the biggest messes on the gym floor, and i had to save two elderly patients from tripping over stuff because they were focused on doing the exercise and not so much to what was on the ground
6. Will use ALL the beds with ONE patient, and then when its time for the next round of patients, he will STARE at me while im trying to clean them all but refuses to pick up the other spray bottle and help me out for a few seconds. Im not fast enough for him but does nothing to help
7. Gets upset when I take lunch at certain times because he claims he needs my help. What he fails to realize is that, no matter when I take my lunch, it would be when someone needs me. But i need to eat its not his place to have any say. 
8. And whenever he DOES need my help, its him commanding me around like im a robot. ""You need to help them do this one"", ""You should know what to help them with next."" Never any formality like ""Please"" or ""Thank you"", he just talks AT me. I wasn't raised to ask people for help without manners, and that I should expect no help if I don't use them because its kind of rude. 

I finally reached my limit on Friday, when he turned to me and said ""You should know that they don't ever do that exercise, you've done this like 5 times."" 

I didn't say word back to him. I helped the patient finish their exercise, turned everything that I was supposed to over, grabbed my stuff and walked right out the door. I genuinely felt like if I continued to stand there I was going to punch him in the throat. 

Am I the asshole?

We live out of state and are moving to South Jersey in a few months. We're going to rent for a year or two to get our bearings. We both work from home, so we can choose where we live.

1hh3djw,https://i.redd.it/ht5biqnzfm7e1.jpeg,My bilirubin is still high 3 months after hep c treatment ,"I plan on seeing a doctor about this, but I need some kind of idea of what to expect. My bilirubin is at 1.7. All of my other liver levels are down but bilirubin is still as high as it was before.  The note from my Dr said ""please meet with primary care to determine cause and possible treatment"". 

I'm going to add in all possibly related health information, so I'm sorry for the length. I'll try to keep it coherent. I tried to join the hep c sub, but it's a restricted sub and I haven't been accepted yet. It seems to be dead. 

I had hep c for 5/6 years before treatment. My hep c Dr told me my liver damage was between either levels 1 and 2, or  2 and 3, I can't remember for sure. 

15-20 years ago, I was suicidal and overdosed on Tylenol a handful of times. I was hospitalized for it 3 times, one time I wasn't hospitalized until around 24 hours after initially taking the Tylenol. I knew I likely did some damage. 


Liver damage is something I can live with. I've been clean for 6 years, I no longer drink, I take good care of myself, I stay hydrated, I don't take anything with Tylenol when I have a headache or am sick. From what I understand, cirrhosis isn't reversible but is not a big deal as long as you don't further the damage, right? 

But my Dr had also told me about 1 in 5 people get cancer from hep c. I've known several people with hep c but have never known anyone with hep c to get cancer, so I'm not liking those odds. 

I have been losing weight since last spring- I've lost about 15-20 pounds without trying. I'm 4'11 and currently around 90 pounds, but a few months ago was around 85-88 pounds. This was from around 110-115 in spring. I dropped weight *fast*. Within about 2 months I was in the low 90s, and by mid summer I was in the high 80s. It's stabilized since then though.  

I have stomach aches in the morning a few times a week, but I also drink coffee with too much caffeine sometimes. I had assumed that was the cause and have tried to cut down on the caffeine. 

I'm tired all the time, I actually thought I had narcolepsy for a little bc I'd fall asleep standing and couldn't drive for more than 10 mins bc falling asleep was such a risk. I've been sleeping more to try to combat that and I think it's helping, although I'm still pretty fatigued sometimes. I'm so drained by the end of the day. 

I don't think I'm yellowing. My eyes don't look yellow, my skin tone hasn't changed.  My undertone has always been a neutral I think. 

I've also wondered if I'm anemic- I get dizzy and lightheaded sometimes, and lose a lot of blood during my period. The first 2-3 days I have to empty my 30mL cup every hour or so, sometimes more. The blood is pure blood, not like regular chunky/thick period blood.  I generally lose 400-700mL per period. I have extreme fatigue during my period and suspect it's from the blood loss but idk for sure. I know extremely heavy periods can cause anemia. 

I had hypothyroidism when I was pregnant, but as far as I know, it fixed itself after having my son. The medication made me feel worse after I had him, and my Dr took me off it. Iirc it's bc my labs for my thyroid levels were back to normal. 

I have no other diagnosed health conditions.  I'm kind of freaking out, but want to know what the most likely cause is. TIA

1hh3a35,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hh3a35,Park Hyatt New York Trip Report,"Just finished up a 2 night stay at PHNY with a Guest of Honor, here are my thoughts:

THE GOOD-

The view was absolutely amazing from the room. We had room 2102 and it had a beautiful Central Park view from both the bedroom and bathroom. Room itself was great from giant bathroom, fantastic water pressure in shower with rainfall and movable nozzle, and good size bedroom. The bed was extremely comfortable and my P2 said she had the best sleep ever in that bed. The pool, whirlpool and gym were absolutely amazing! Getting to exercise with a few of the NYC skyline was something that I didn‚Äôt even know I had on my bucket list. Unlike other reviews I‚Äôve seen, the staff were actually great. Always warm and polite and started small talk when appropriate. We got in at noon on check in day and we were able to get our upgraded city view room right away.

THE OKAY-

The room service breakfast was vastly different both days. The first day we didn‚Äôt get any condiments, my P2 got the wrong bacon, and no powder sugar on the pancakes. However the food was delicious both days and the 2nd day we had no mistakes either the order, had our coffee poured for us, and was given an extra apple juice for whatever reason. Pancakes and waffles were some of the best I had and the juices were very good as well. If it weren‚Äôt for the GOH, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have paid the $120 for the breakfast however lol.

THE BAD- 

No locker rooms near gym and pool but they did make that very clear both before and during the stay so can‚Äôt knock them too much on it.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and were definitely happy with our 80k point redemption for the two nights. We would definitely come back for another special occasion or staycation when in New York City in happy to answer any questions anyone has in the replies!",12,1734533677.0,hyatt,14,1.0,False
1hh39v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SuperiorPromos/comments/1hh39v5/what_exactly_is_a_promotional_product/,What Exactly Is a Promotional Product?,"Have you ever received a pen with a company logo on it? Or maybe a tote bag, T-shirt, or even a mug? That‚Äôs a **promotional product**‚Äîa custom-branded item used by businesses to market their brand and leave a lasting impression on customers.

But promotional products are much more than freebies. They‚Äôre one of the **most effective advertising tools** for building brand recognition and loyalty. Here‚Äôs why:

# What Exactly Is a Promotional Product?

A promotional product is any item that is branded with a company‚Äôs logo, name, slogan, or message and is distributed to promote the business. These items are often useful and practical, ranging from pens, calendars, and keychains to higher-end items like backpacks, drinkware, or tech gadgets.

# Why Are Promotional Products So Effective?

1. **Cost-Effective Advertising:** Promotional products have a low cost per impression. For example, a branded T-shirt might cost a few dollars to produce but can generate thousands of impressions as it‚Äôs worn over time.
2. **Practical and Memorable:** People tend to keep and use promotional items, meaning your brand stays in front of them daily. A coffee mug on someone‚Äôs desk is a constant reminder of your business.
3. **Wide Reach:** When someone uses or wears your promotional product in public, your brand gets exposure to a much broader audience.
4. **Builds Loyalty and Relationships:** People love free, useful items! Giving away promotional products creates positive associations with your brand and encourages loyalty.

# Where Can You Get High-Quality Promotional Products?

At [**SuperiorPromos.com**](https://www.superiorpromos.com/), we specialize in high-quality, affordable promotional products for businesses of all sizes. Whether you need custom calendars, tote bags, pens, or apparel, we‚Äôve got you covered. Our products are designed to leave a lasting impression and help you grow your brand.

Promotional products are an investment in your business‚Äôs visibility and reputation. If you‚Äôre looking to stand out in a competitive market, check out [**SuperiorPromos.com**](http://SuperiorPromos.com) and see how we can help you make your mark!

Thank you from the absolute bottom of my heart. I have regained and taken back so much of my life because of you. I thought I had no triggers. I was exhausted and sad. I had given up so much of what I love just to get relief (coffee). And that relief just was not coming. I was convinced I needed to up my doses of amitriptyline. I was convinced I would never be able to have another baby if I wanted one because I suffered so much. I‚Äôve given up my daily can of Coke Zero, the treat I looked forward to most after giving up cups of coffee and espresso. And not only is it better for my migraines, it‚Äôs better for my health. Because regular coke has calories and real sugar and therefore really feels like a big treat, something I definitely do not need every day. Although I do still get vertigo attacks and days that I feel off, they are much fewer and further between. Attacks have gone from hours to 5 minutes or less. Sometimes I can even fight through them and remain standing or cooking or doing whatever it is that I‚Äôm doing. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this will be long term. But even the few weeks of relief I have found has changed me. I‚Äôm not afraid to take my kids places anymore. I don‚Äôt dread when my husband is on shift for 24 hours worried I‚Äôll have vertigo and be down and out for the day. Im even feeling brave enough to sit here while I type this and enjoy my first americano in months (halfway through, feeling that glorious caffeine buzz but so far no dizzinessü§ûüèº). Maybe I‚Äôll even be brave enough to drive the two hours it takes to visit my sister soon. 

I know so many of you suffer daily. And I absolutely feel for you, this is not something I would ever wish on anyone. But for anyone who is in the ‚Äúcutting‚Äù phase to find relief I beg you to cut out the fake sugar. Because better days could be right around the corner.

Tl,dr.: Please, can someone tell me about a routine to get the most consistent result needing the least amount of talent and work?

I bought a GCP 2021 and been using it since. I wanted a machine not too expensive that will last a long time.
I moved in with my girlfriend this year and she just hates the coffee the machine produces.

She has a cheap DeLonghi ""espresso machine"" for around 100 bucks and she preferres the espresso from it. 
And i have to admit, comparing to it, the shots I'm producing on the GCP are really shit.

It's a mix of too sour and too bitter. Tingeling in the back of the throat. Maybe it's even more sour than bitter. It's consistantly bad like this.

The coffee from it was always kinda shit to me, but I just thought it's me who has to learn the art of making espresso. So I stayed patient and tried to improve my game. Comparing to good Viennese espresso i get get around every corner in my neighborhood (I live in Vienna).

It's now a few years later and it didn't improve to the point I'm satisfied.

So I have a modified DeLonghi MG49 grinder. I modified it myself, and it now is able to produce a much finer grind and I'm convinced it's espresso grind, because I'm able to set it to a finer degree than a optimal flowrate would need. It's just dripping barely on the finest setting.

I got it for free from a friend and a short research later I found out a lot of people seem to use it for espresso grinds successfully.
So i gave it a try, thinking the mod will break the motor shortly afterwards, but it was free so whatever.
Didn't happen. Still works fine 3 years later.

So I tried to clock it in by slowly increasing the grind setting.
From barely dripping to flowing freely with no resistance at all.
I noticed there is not a lot of in-between of the two extremes.
There is a sweet spot visually (it looks right) but it's really hard to get. 


Tried all the different stages. The sour-bitter taste didn't vanish.

I did the 9 bar mod.

I'm using the default portafilter with the default basket for double shots. Not the pressurized ones.

I use only the default tools coming with the machine. 
I surf without a temperature display.
About 10 seconds after the red light lights up. I let the water flow for around 10 to 15 seconds (double basket), or till the espresso cup is full... 

Weighing it exactly for consistent results didn't improve anything. Around 20g. Tried out different volumes. Nothing helped. 

I thought maybe the it's coffee beans itself and tried a lot of different roasts. All comparing to the shots the delonghi cheapo produced. The delonghi was always better. 
It was also more consistent. It seems the grind doesn't have to be on point to be drinkable.

Comparing to the GCP where the smallest missing variable makes the shot unbarable. 
I don't want to weigh the coffee everytime for just a mediocre shot. My girlfriend also will not have it. 

Is it normal for it to be that difficult to get a normal coffee? I don't need it to be world changing. But how is it possible that the 5 times more expensive machine is not able to deliver the same quality as the cheaper one. 

How is this machine so popular if it's so hard to get it right?
Is it possible there is something wrong with the machine? How to trouble shoot?
Is it all my fault and I'm just not made to be a barista?
 
Are these cheap delonghi machines conceptualized around a customer who knows jackshit about making espresso?
If so, how are these machines ""worse""?

Is it the grinder in the end? If it is, is it really only possible to get drinkable coffee out of a GCP if you have an expensive grinder beside it?

Can someone tell me about a routine to get the most consistent result needing the least amount of talent and work?",2,1734533151.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False

It all started back in May when my son was born. Our home got hit with a nasty stomach flu. It was just me and my daughter that caught it. Thankfully my wife didn't catch it, because her c-section was scheduled 2-days out. I'll make the next part hidden/spoiler in case you don't want to hear the details of a stomach flu.

>!\>!So it started with my daughter. Typical kid throwing up, etc. I was the one taking care of her because my wife was pregnant and due any day. I knew I was probably going to catch it... and I did. It was one of the worst stomach flus I've had too. I threw up so much food. Even after limiting myself that day leading up to it. I threw up SO MUCH DAMN FOOD. It was a moment of realization as I sat on the floor next to the toilet, throwing up the third time and still seeing food in my puke. I thought to myself ""How did I eat all this? I could've sworn I ate light today"". I really wanted to stop puking at that point, but it was because I had eaten so much that I was puking so much !< I learned in that moment I ate ""light"" in accordance with what I thought back then was light. It was a reality check and I realized that I sucked at portioning and monitoring my caloric intake.

The c-section day came. I had not eaten in well over 24-hours, but I actually felt fine. Actually, it was probably closer to 48-hours. I just fueled myself on powerade and water. This wasn't a personal decision, it was just what the primal part of my brain was telling me I could stomach.

After the c-section though I had ordered some food from the hospital. Just light stuff like a soup and crackers. I think I had a small sandwich later that day too. When we returned home from the hospital, I was really scarred from the stomach flu and ate light for almost an entire week. Even lunch and dinners were more like snacks. I eventually started eating meals that were more full, but I had somehow naturally skipped out on eating breakfast in the morning-- and the strange part about it is it was something I didn't even really realize. I just had my 1-2 morning coffee with 1x milk and that was it. To this day, 7-months later, that is still my ritual. Wake up around 6am, 1-2 coffees in the morning, and lunch starts at around 11am-12pm. The next meal is dinner, and that's usually it. Without realizing it, my body naturally slid into a schedule of intermittent fasting.

I've lost 45 lbs since my stomach flu in May. In those 7-months, I can't think of a single day that was really difficult or where I was fighting with myself to break this new eating lifestyle. I finally found my groove that works for me. I've tried so many different diets and workout regimes over the last 10+ years, and finally found one that works for me.

I want to end this with 2 things.

The first is that it can take a long long long time to find the diet and lifestyle that works with you. But keep at it. There will be many downs, but there will also be many ups too. It took me over 10 years, but it was worth it. I hope if you're reading this that you find what works for you too. It needs to be something that you can live with for the rest of your life. If it's not, then it is not the right diet for you.

The second thing is that while you are losing it, realize that it is completely normal to have periods where you feel hungry. And during those periods, it's OK to not eat. Remember that this is a mental game. Unfortunately our brains truly have a mind of their own when it comes to food. It's a battle and you need to be prepared to fight when the moment strikes.",18,1734532303.0,loseit,15,0.8,False

But this one MOB is my roman empire of crazy mothers. For context, this was an out of town wedding, I had to drive 3 hours to the venue which was a stunning property with a Victorian BnB plus farm that was converted to a wedding venue. It was in the middle of wine country so just a stunningly beautiful place to hold a wedding. The couple put me and my second shooter up in a nearby hotel as it was going to be a full day (11 hours) of planned coverage so we would not be driving home until the next day. There was also a videographer team of two working alongside of us, plus an independent wedding planner so every angle of planning and logistics was going to be covered for the couple to have not a thing to worry about.

From the moment I arrived though it was chaos. The carefully co-ordinated timeline we had planned out with the couple and the vendors went out the window from the very beginning. They wanted to swap around order of events that we talked them through and the wedding coordinator had cleared with the venue and other vendors. But we were an amazing team who rolled with the punches and thankfully the couple was laid back enough that they weren't fixated on a vision, just on having a good time with their people. Which, fair enough.  If I was shooting this wedding alone I might have lost my mind working with no timeline for what was a very large wedding. But having the other photographer, the videographers and the wedding planner there we all made it work.

Now, onto the MOB. When we arrived we were supposed to have 1 hour of getting ready photos with both the bride's people and the grooms party, time to do shots of the venue itself, flat lays, etc. But immediately the bride wanted to get into her dress, do some quick photos with her bridal party and do first look with the groom. We go into the Victorian house on the property the family was staying at night before and night of the wedding to use one of the main floor parlour rooms for this moment. So it is bride, MOB, one videographer and me entering to get her into the dress and document that moment with her mom. When we walk into the room the FOB and an uncle (not sure but he was hanging out with FOB all day) are in there because there was a small bar set up making drinks.   
  
As we are now doing the getting into the dress way ahead of schedule I told them not to rush, to make their drinks but then clear the room so bride could get changed. One thing about the room was though set up as a traditional sitting room, it did *not* have replica furniture in it. The only part of the room relevant to this part of the story was the coffee ""table"", and I use that term loosely. Basically it was a large rectangular glass box, [something like this.](https://glassfurniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/glass-coffee-table-cubic-3.jpg) So very easy to not notice unless you are looking right at it, because it is well... see through. As FOB grabs his drinks and turns to leave the room him bumps right into it. Nearly goes tumbling ass over tea kettle, some of his drink spills but manages to catch himself on a chair and prevent a big disaster. 

That is the moment MOB flies off the handle. She immediately starts screaming at him in Polish, and though I know exactly 0 words in Polish I knew she was tearing him a new one. The bride tries to calm her mother down stating to her something like ""Mom, it's okay, accident happens."" but this does very little to actually calm MOB down until FOB and the other family member scuttle out of the room. The moment he is gone MOB calms down and we proceed with getting the bride in her dress and acts like a sweet lamb the whole time, like me and the videographer did not just witness her go nuclear five minutes prior.

After this the lead videographer and myself exchange looks and a few quiet ""can you believe that just happened?"" before we move on to the first look. Now in my years of working weddings I know some people have boiling point or moments their anxiety flares, maybe MOB was worried the dress would have been ruined by FOB's drink? Who knows? But I go on with my day thinking that was MOB's moment and everything else will be fine from here.

Charlotte, I was wrong. So very wrong. 

The next MOB moment came an hour or so later, after we did family photos and now I properly get to go bridal party photos (again because the timeline was getting flipped around) so I am with the bride and her party when I see MOB stomping up to us with the wedding planner frantically on her heels trying to be a buffer so I could finish the group photos. It did not work.

 When MOB reaches us she calls for the bride and MOH (who was the bride's older sister);

MOB: Bride, I need to talk to you. NOW!

MOH: We are doing photos right now, it will have to wait until we are done. 

MOB: No, it must be now. I can't believe you'd do this to me. I can't. I just can't believe this. 

BRIDE: Is it really an emergency mom? 

MOH: Yes! We must fix it right now. I will not sit there! I won't it needs to be changed!

The bride and MOH ask for a moment, which I tell them is totally fine and they step to the side with the wedding planner to chat. I proceed with photos of the bridal party left out of the convo, but as I am taking some pictures of them I can somewhat overhear the conversation. I was able to surmise that MOB was in the venue switching the seating arrangement and tables on her own. When the wedding planner found her told her everything would need to be switched back to how it was for the caterer to give people the correct meals. MOB was vibrantly upset and said she refused to sit at the table she was assigned too and that she needed to be moved. The exact why I didn't overhear but after the earlier outburst I assumed maybe MOB and FOB were no longer together and she did not want to sit with or near him. 

Fine minutes later the Bride and MOH return for photos and we wrap up. I later find out from the wedding planner that it wasn't a case of who the MOB was sitting with. It was that the table she was assigned to sit at was a table in the middle of the room's configuration, right in front of the couple sweetheart table, but there was a table to left side of the sweetheart table (where the bride would be sitting) and she wanted to be at the table and the seat that was as close to the bride as possible.   
  
The rest of the day runs rather smoothly and I start to think the worst is behind us once the ceremony is over and dinner has started. Besides some comments that the MOB made to me or my second shooter during cocktail hour about very minor complaints like the microphone cutting out for a few seconds during the ceremony, that the flower girls ""wasted"" the petals during the processional by dumping them all in one spot, or that the couple immediately went with us after the ceremony to do a champagne spray shot with their groom/bridals parties and they could not congratulate them right away, etc. Surely there can't be anything else MOB can freak out about, right? Right? 

Wrong.

Through the dinner courses speeches were given by friends and family members. When the MOB and FOB get up to give their speech they approach the podium with a leather folder and pull out a prepared speech which is handed to FOB and he starts the speech off. Now, as a reminder there is 2 videographers there each holding cameras but also they have 2 fixed cameras recording from different angles so they have at least 4 feeds of this speech being documented. The FOB had a heavy accent and English was clearly not his first language and he read off the speech that was very nice, and short - saying all the things one would expect a FOB to say. 

It is about 3 minutes total and when he is done with that was prepared then he looks up tosses the paper to the side and addresses the room saying "" That is what my wife wrote for me to say, now I will speak from my heart.""

Cue the nuclear freakout from the MOB. She very dramatically rolls her eyes, huffing and than starts to hit the FOB.

These were not the mildly annoyed taps of a wife trying to get her husband to cut his shenanigans (oh yeah, also by this point we had found out MOB and FOB were not separate/divorced). These were open hands slaps against his arm, chest and side of his head that I could fully hear as I was standing near the middle of the room with the lead videographer. We immediate share a look of wide eyed concern and at that moment I was wondering if I or the wedding planner needs to be calling the police or at the very least some of the venue guys to break up what looked like a domestic assault happening in plain view of everyone. Once again MOB is angrily berating him in Polish and trying to now grab the microphone from his hand even looking like she was trying to claw his arms to get it. FOB was however a solid man and was able to kinda push her off and walks around the podium to stand in front and continue on with his off the cuff part of the speech like nothing was happening. 

FOB proceeds to give a very sweet and short addition to his speech, talking about how he is proud of Bride as a father and even of MOH and that he is considers himself fortunate to have raised who strong, incredible women whom he admires. For being just a spur of the moment/speaking from the heart it was incredibly sweet to hear and well done. When he is done he literally does a mic drop and goes back to his seat to the roaring applause from the rest of the wedding guests. 

Now as this part of his speech is happening, MOB is throwing what I can only describe as a toddler tantrum on the other side of the podium. She is red in the face, still spouting off in Polish, throwing things around and stomping her feet. Carrying on like this until the MC returns the microphone to the podium after FOB was done and then she proceeds to open her folder, pull out some papers and read her part of the speech *LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED*. 

The real kicker was about two minutes in, she turns to the couple and says; ""The wisdom I give to you both is that marriage takes patience and kindness.""

There was some other minor moments through dinner that I could see MOB having tense words with the MOH and other family members but I had no idea what was said but I can only assume it was about her behaviour. When videographer and I returned to our table the wedding planner joked with us saying hopefully none of us would have to give evidence or testimony about what just happened to the police that night.

At the end of the night when we (videographers and us) are packing up to leave we go to say goodbye to the bride who was already fairly tipsy. She apologized profusely for changing the timeline and for the drama we witnessed. She also added ""My mother gets like this when she is stressed.""

This wedding was in September 2024 and I have since sent the photo gallery to the couple, they loved it and not even in one photo could you tell there was so much MOB drama. They sent a long email back grateful for the memories and that was that. To this date I don't think there was any further fallout from what happened and hopefully I never have a MOB try to top this one. ",6,1734532125.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I worked as a Line cook once before, at a coffee house with a Greek/Mediterranean menu for food items ranging from flatbreads, salads, to gyros. It was light work, the chef was only there sometimes, and each cook would work solitary shifts, having the small kitchen all to themselves. I worked there for a few months, a little under two years ago.

However for the past year, I‚Äôve been working as a deli clerk on a bowl line (similar to Chipotle), making sandwiches, bowls, burritos, wraps, the like‚Ä¶ Not cooking anything, though..

I want to assume that I have the experience required for this job, but I‚Äôm nervous. I literally start this job tomorrow.

So I 20F met this guy we‚Äôll call him Adam 21M back in my freshman year of high school and he was a sophomore. I was getting my volunteer hours filming for the school football team and he was a player. We exchanged numbers, texted, late night phone calls, etc; I really thought things were going good and we were getting along exceptionally well. To my surprise a couple weeks in he had ended things for reasons at this point I do not remember. I started speaking to someone else who ended up being my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship however real it can be when you‚Äôre 14-15 yrs old. When Adam found out he decided to apologize and tell me he was sorry wanted a relationship with me etc. I had declined and we went quite awhile not speaking and avoiding each other in the halls. this lasted about a year and half when we connected again. Once again started chatting and had made plans to meet up, we ended up hooking up and it went radio silent on his end. Life moved on and about another year later we started speaking again made plans and hooked up and once again I was ghosted. I started making a joke of it to my friends that this was my annual hookup. He ended up getting into a pretty serious long-term relationship so I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in awhile but once they had ended their relationship he reached out to me again and we started talking and I‚Äôm sure from the pattern of where this is going you know what happened next, this one was different, we stayed the night, he made me coffee in the morning kept me around a little bit later into the afternoon and I had finally thought we were going somewhere and that this time he really liked me like this time and where my dumbass thought he was going to sweep me off my feet and ride into the sunset but once again I was ghosted. We hadn‚Äôt spoken for probably 5-6 months when he reached out to me again late this past August and we started chatting, I made a promise to myself I wouldn‚Äôt be so readily available and being in college I was pretty busy and had other things to occupy my time and mind but the chatting had went well and progressed. He asked me out for lunch by my school and we went out had good conversation and I finally felt like I was taking control of the narrative, until‚Ä¶ you guessed it, radio silence. I had decided to take a respectful approach this time and just messaged him thanking him for lunch and how lovely it was catching up and I hope everything was alright. He had reached back out about day later explaining to me he was basically hung up on his ex (a different girl) and how she was practically harassing him at his place of work bringing in the guy she had cheated on him with. I tried to be reassuring and encouraging telling him this girl was clearly trying to get a reaction out of him and for him to ignore it but had put the timeline together and since that lovely morning we had together to him reaching out again, he had gotten himself a new girlfriend. The on and off texting continued for about another 2 months, until I found it pointless and had stopped answering entirely. He had sent me random things like memes on instagram that I had responded to, but once again I stopped all together. Around Monday night he sent me a DM asking ‚Äúwhy are we playing cat and mouse‚Äù, I had responded ‚Äúonly one person is playing and has been for years‚Äù.  I will attach that convo below for readers to indulge themselves. Please the read texts to get his response to wanting to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.

I have it. When I say I ""have it"" I don't mean I'm aware that everyone has a full and rich life. No I mean I know what they've done.

I'm in a coffee shop typing this. I know the guy who just walked in and ordered a latte beats his wife. He beat her three nights ago. A two weeks ago. And about two or three times a month on average since they've been married. Two years ago he beat her so hard she miscarried.

I know every horrible thing anyone I'm within... I dunno I guess about 50 yards of me at any given moment, has ever done.

But that's not the bad part. As soon as the bad things they've done pops in my head, it's followed by the good.

The guy who's picking his latte from the barista right now beats his wife. But also volunteers on a suicide hot line. He's saved 37 lives from suicide.

The lady at the table next to me is just a jerk. Screams at cashiers when her coupon is expired and never returns her shopping cart. And she defended her daughter from the rest of the family when she came out as a lesbian

I know what you're thinking. ""But this is wonderful. You see the good side of everyone!"" And sure for the Karen at the next table maybe it is a good kind of perspective. But the coffee guy wife beater?  He hasn't balanced his scales.

And if it was just thoughts, I could live with it.

But 3 years ago I was coming back with my wife from running errands. We startled a guy who was trying to break into our house. He had 3 felony warrants for armed robbery and he knew he would die in prison if he got caught again. 

But I also knew that he was robbing my house to feed his family. So I paused. I just stood there. And he shoved my wife and ran off. My wife hit her head on the concrete step and died.

I'm not trying to tell anyone that seeing the good side of people is bad. It's nothing that simplistic.  Even the worst of us are complete human beings, my experience has convinced me of that.

But people do horrible things that don't get outweighed by the good they do. There are people walking around who even the most compassionate among us would be comfortable labeling monsters who shouldn't be just free in society.

*<Saying Good Morning to You> by Anna Yanami*

This morning, I‚Äôm pretending to be reading magazines while observing the opposite of the road through the glass as usual.

The magazine corner of the 7-Eleven on the way to school can see the crossroad perfectly. Obviously, that includes him, who is waiting for the traffic lights to turn green every morning.
I have to greet him today, and then I‚Äôll muster my courage for us to go to school together‚Ä¶
At this moment, I can smell something delicious.
The staff member is yelling, ‚ÄúFresh smoked sausages!‚Äù
I love all of the hot foods in 7-Eleven.

Their smoked sausages are all natural. That powerful crunchiness is its signature. The smoked taste really arouses one‚Äôs appetite. The palm-size is perfect for eating one in the morning.
Typically, it‚Äôs prepared earlier. However, today‚Äôs sausages seem to be fresh.
Right now, he is nowhere to be seen. I quickly lined up before the cashier.
This is the only time you have to line up before the cashier. I can barely contain my excitement. Then, it‚Äôs finally my turn.
‚ÄúOne smoked sausage, please!‚Äù
‚Äú116 yen.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright. Ah, just right.‚Äù

As I was taking money out of my wallet, familiar laughter could be heard from the opened automated door. He‚Äôs waiting for the traffic lights with his friends.
Then, it turned green.
‚ÄúNo need to put it inside a paper bag! I‚Äôll just hold it like this!‚Äù
I took the sausage. Then, when I was trying to put my wallet back, I realized both of my hands were full.
He‚Äôll leave if this continues.

I hesitated for a moment before biting the sausage horizontally. After that, I barely slipped through the closing automated door and dashed out.
(Warning: Never run with a bamboo stick in your mouth, whether horizontally or not.)
I have to say hi to him.
‚ÄúOO-kun, good morn-‚Äú
I caught the sausage falling from my mouth. My shoulders dropped depressingly as the lights turned red.

He already went past the zebra crossing and departed along with his cheerful friends.
I still‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt get to greet him today.
The fresh sausage seems to taste a little bitter for some reason.

*<I Told You I Won‚Äôt Give Up> by Anna Yanami*

I‚Äôm a bit different this morning. I‚Äôve formulated the perfect plan to say ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù to him.
I headed out home slightly earlier. On my way to school, I got a good position in the 7-Eleven convenience store‚Äôs eating corner. I‚Äôm trying to order more snacks at the cashier. If I choose a hotdog, he will leave before the staff member can finish heating it.

That‚Äôs why my conclusion is to buy riceball takoyaki.
Riceball takoyaki can be immediately consumed right after purchase. This way, I can immediately chase after him upon sight.
The roasted takoyaki with salty and sweet sauce and mayo is absolutely perfect. It tastes as good without heating.

Also, the milk foam of the hot latte I ordered tastes very good too. I‚Äôve been completely attracted to it recently.
Someone seemed to have lined up behind me while I was listening to the coffee machine grinding the beans.

‚ÄúEh, Ako-san? I didn‚Äôt know you would drink something other than sweetened juice.‚Äù
The person who talks to me is my classmate XX-kun.
His mouth is ass. He always says things that piss me off.

He‚Äôs holding a cup of iced coffee. Poor guy. He probably still doesn‚Äôt know how good a latte is, right?
I ignored XX-kun and looked outside the window.
I jolted. ‚ÄúHe‚Äù and his friends are already waiting for the traffic lights at the crossroad.
I was utterly unaware because I thought I would be safe by heading out earlier.
I hastily tried to open the coffee machine‚Äôs lid, yet I couldn‚Äôt. It was automatically locked for safety purposes.

I could only stomp my feet around as I waited anxiously. At this time, I heard a ‚Äúdododo‚Äù sound. The latte is finally ready.

Open the lid, pour the coffee, and close the lid. Done.
The traffic lights at the crossroad coincidentally turned green. I can still probably catch up if I‚Äôm quick.
I hastily dashed out of the automatic doors, but then I quickly headed back inside.
Indeed, I just remembered that I needed to add sugar.

During this time, XX-kun threw a pack of something at me. I caught it mid-air. It‚Äôs sugar. He must have noticed that I forgot to put it in, right?
However, I still returned to the eating corner like this.
‚ÄúAko-san, don‚Äôt you need sugar?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt say anything and continued opening the coffee cup‚Äôs lid.
XX-kun, you won‚Äôt understand, anyway.
My principle is to put two packs of sugar in my latte‚Ä¶

As usual, I occupied the food court by myself. However, someone called my name this time.

The meaty stuffing and chewy dough are extraordinary. I have to try it 5 times every week in winter.
XX-kun doesn‚Äôt seem to know where he‚Äôs heading. He looked in my direction and said, ‚ÄúOh, I see.‚Äù What a smartass.

Outside the window, OO-kun is waiting for the traffic signal at the zebra crossing. A girl is standing next to him.
That‚Äôs Jko-chan.
She‚Äôs the girl who has been hanging out with him lately. I can see they are chatting happily.
Going to school with a guy in public, I think this is a little indecent.
XX-kun put a cup before me when I was eating my pork bun silently.
It‚Äôs a hot latte, a large one also.

I glared at him because it blocked my sight. As for XX-kun, he sat down two seats away from me.
‚ÄúHere. You like coffee, right?‚Äù
XX-kun didn‚Äôt say that loudly.
Come to think of it, it‚Äôs December 24th today. Is this a Christmas present?
Even though I don‚Äôt really like it, I‚Äôm not a girl who tramples on other people‚Äôs kindness.
The pork bun has already depleted the moisture in my mouth. A cup of hot coffee can soothe my body.
The coffee is thick, but there‚Äôs a refreshing taste of milk mixed within. This is delicious every time I try it.‚Äù

XX-kun, did you put sugar into this?‚Äù
‚ÄúI did. Ako-san wants two packs of sugar, right?‚Äù
You can‚Äôt be helped. I sighed internally.
A large cup needs three packs of sugar.

However, a mature woman must not expose her emotions so easily.
The traffic light turned green. He and Jko-chan laughed and walked across the zebra crossing.
Seeing that, I can feel there‚Äôs an extra tinge of bitterness in my latte.

*<New Year‚Äôs Gift> by Anna Yanami* 

I usually have breakfast in the convenience store.
One of my recent favorites in the rest area is charcoal grilled chicken skewers (salted). I don‚Äôt think I need to explain.

Those who are interested can look at the ingredients table. Yes, the row with carbohydrates.
Even though I don‚Äôt remember the actual numbers, it‚Äôs a champion because it‚Äôs so low.
Also, I‚Äôm having hot black coffee instead of a latte.
This is a champion for low values. That‚Äôs two champions in a row.
Convenience stores these days let you choose your coffee taste from ‚Äúlight‚Äù to ‚Äústrong‚Äù, but it tastes especially strong today.

I stopped leaving my house early lately. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt see OO-kun going to school outside the window.
‚ÄúAko-san, you stopped eating meat buns these days, yeah?‚Äù
The person saying unnecessary things is my classmate, XX-kun.
We‚Äôve been eating together in the corner recently.
Also, I used to eat pork buns. What an amateur.

He‚Äôs always sitting two seats away from me. How self-conscious. It‚Äôs disgusting.
Even though he doesn‚Äôt care about others in every way, he‚Äôs even meaner today. I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs having an American hot dog in the morning.
That‚Äôs right. The carbohydrates in a hot dog exceed 30 grams.
I want to eat that too.
Also, he just has to be drinking a latte instead of coffee today.
I want to drink that too.
But I thought I could ask for a bite from him. Then, one of the girls from our school started talking to XX-kun.

The two whispered something to each other, and then, after a while, that girl took a bite of XX-kun‚Äôs hot dog before leaving.
‚Ä¶Even though I don‚Äôt know who that is, she‚Äôs such a greedy and despicable girl for wanting somebody else‚Äôs food.
XX-kun chuckled after I finished my skewers.
‚ÄúAko-san, are you still hungry?‚Äù
This guy is as impolite as usual.

XX-kun gave me something when I was about to ignore him. It‚Äôs a yuzu pepper-flavored tofu stick.
One stick of this gives you 10 grams of protein. It‚Äôs pretty chewy as well.
‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre trying to lose weight lately. Here‚Äôs a little snack for you.‚Äù
‚Ä¶This person is really impolite, after all.
I remembered that girl as I chewed on a tofu stick from another person.
Comparing a tofu stick to a bite of an American hotdog, I think I won here.
*Although that‚Äôs how I feel, somehow, my heart is itching a little*. It‚Äôs irritating‚Ä¶


**Too Many Losing Heroines! V6 Chapter 4**

*Literature Club Report - Special Edition*
*<I Choose You> by Anna Yanami*

I'm standing in front of the usual convenience store.
But I can't go inside. The sign is down, and the windows are covered with sheets.
Someone spoke to me when I stared at the building.
""Hey, Ako-san. Did this convenience store close down?""

The clueless interloper is XX-kun. Oh dear, he knows nothing.
I saw them bringing new shelves into this building yesterday evening.
That means the convenience store will open again once the renovations are complete.

I took out 3 different types of boneless chicken from my bag after giving him a half-assed response.
XX-kun widened his eyes. My my, I know you won't understand.
The large sign along the road was also taken down, so a different chain store might move in once renovations are done.

That's why I got up early and bought boneless chicken from three different chains.
I plan to compare them and predict which chain will move in next.
Let's start with the first one.
When I bit into it, the aroma of spices filled my mouth. But the taste doesn't lose out, either. After the fragrance escaped through the nose, the meat's flavor spread throughout my mouth. Yes, this is the one I've decided on.

Though it's decided already, to be fair, I must also evaluate the second one.
The crunchiness upon the first bite is exhilarating. The juicy meat further boosted my already skyrocketing mood. This is it. It's decided.

But having said that, I must not let the third option cool down.
Despite its crunchy appearance, the finely textured breading danced on my tongue.
Each chew changes the texture and fragrance. It's bewitching, to be honest. This one is also a definite choice.
...Well, it seems I've decided on all of them.

Since I had no choice, I began planning a second round of evaluation, but XX-kun was staring at me.
Perhaps he wants some, too? How greedy of him.
However, since he always shares his food with me, I guess I should be kind occasionally.
XX-kun shook his head when I said he could take a bite.
""I'm not a fan of eating after someone else. I'll pass.""

What's with this guy? So rude.
Annoyed, I stacked the three pieces of chicken and took a big bite.
He's still watching me as I savor the feast fit for a king.
""Ako-san, where will you eat breakfast once this place closes?""
I'll eat at home.

Because the only reason I started coming here was to go to school with OO-kun, but now that he has started going out with Jko-chan, there's no reason for me to come here anymore.
*But I kept feeling better and better upon seeing XX-kun's anxious look.*
I ignored him and shoved the rest of the chicken in my mouth.
Let him be anxious. He'll understand everything once the new store opens.",17,1734531380.0,TooManyLosingHeroines,5,1.0,False

1hh2hbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagoapartments/comments/1hh2hbg/deciding_between_printers_row_and_logan_square/,Deciding between Printer's Row and Logan Square?,"So I am 24 and I am moving to Chicago - I have narrowed down my neighborhoods to Printer's Row and Logan Square.

Logan Square / Wicker Park area have all the things I'm into - book stores, coffee shops, lots of restaurants. I think I'll find a lot of like-minded people there, and my goal is is to put myself out there more and try to make friends. But it has been so difficult to find a spacious unit at an actually reputable complex. It's pretty expensive there too.

I really like Printer's Row because the luxury apartments are really nice there, it's quiet, and it has easy transportation to pretty much everywhere in Chicago (which is a huge plus, cause I want to experience every neighborhood). But everyone I've talked to says I will get bored in South Loop quickly - there just isn't a lot. But the library and some of the art institutions aren't far, but I guess otherwise, there just doesn't seem to be a lot around. It's also like 10-15 min away from work.

This is a huge decision and I've been so indecisive. Any advice?",0,1734531309.0,chicagoapartments,6,0.5,False
