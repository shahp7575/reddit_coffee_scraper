My parents host and they are big drinkers. Several in my family are also big drinkers. Obviously, I have been known to be probably the biggest drinker. All that to say, there will be people drinking tonight at the party. 

I‚Äôm hyper aware that I need to be very careful tonight and even the next several days. This will be my first time in nearly 50 days being in an environment where people are drinking. 

My plan: 
1. I told several friends my commitment to remain sober and asked them to think of me.
2. I told my family I am not drinking and offered to babysit and DD (rookie move, I know). 
3. I am my ride home. 
4. I am taking sparkling water and will make coffee there. 
5. I‚Äôm going to eat really good and not worry about sugar or carbs. 

Does anyone have any other recommendations for me for surviving my first party?? Wish me luck!! ",1,1729937398.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

The quiet house, the freshly brewed coffee, the reading of the news, the uninterrupted poop and the one on one time with my faithful long-time furry companion.... I enjoyed none of this as a (very) drunk man.  Alarms were either ignored or slept through as I tried in desperation to maximize whatever healing time I could muster to combat the self-inflicted damage done the night before.  I can't believe how long I lived that way - waking up immediately behind the 8 ball (sometimes literally, IYKYK) and scrambling to make up for lost time on the day.  Instead of a relaxing breakfast, the kids would bear witness to a literal madman running around the house at top speed trying to assemble nutritious lunches and a haphazard breakfast for them simultaneously.

No wonder I was stressed out all the time and ""needed"" a drink...I was set up for failure by myself before I even got out of bed!  Now it is a different story...Dad is firing on all cylinders right out of the gate and my shit is on point by the time the rest of the minions rise.

My real passion was coffee. Every day, I woke up, filled my senses with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and dreamed about the day I would be able to share that joy with others.



One fresh autumn morning, I just made up my mind and decided to take the leap of faith. In my wee kitchen, I began playing with the coffee beans and brewing techniques. Friends and family became my taste testers, and I was surprised at how much they loved what I was making!



With their urging, I set up a small pop-up coffee stand out in front of the local farmers' market. I put my heart into each cup and told stories about the beans that I was using, sourced from other local roasters. Long hours, early mornings, and a lot of learning curves were the results, yet each smile of a satisfied customer kept fueling my passion.



As I grew my business, I found out quite promptly that while having a great product was important, unless I told the world about it, nobody would buy. I thus began to research methods of optimization so my website's visibility would improve. My question is, what are some SEO tips or tools you all found helpful for boosting your business? Let's share some ideas!

Rose Sharp tossed on the plush hotel bed, another sleepless night in another soulless room. This time it was the Shangri-La in Vancouver, but it could have been anywhere. Her mind drifted to the private jet that brought her here, the wall of security that whisked her from tarmac to hotel. Like a prisoner transfer, not a star's arrival.



She scrolled through her phone, each comment cutting deeper than the last. ""Spoiled brat."" ""Lost touch with reality."" ""Must be nice in your ivory tower."" They didn't understand. How could they? The isolation, the constant scrutiny, every breath analyzed and commodified. Sure, she had everything - except the simple freedom to exist.



She thought back to this morning's landing. The Canadian air felt different, somehow crisp, cold, fresher than in the south. But she'd barely gotten to taste it before being hustled into the waiting SUV. ""Security concerns,"" Marcus had said, like he always did. Everything was a security concern.



Tomorrow was the last show on tour. BC Place would be packed, sixty thousand voices screaming her name. They'd sing her lyrics back to her, thinking they knew her soul because they knew her songs. None of them seeing the scared ‚Äúlittle rich girl‚Äù who'd never learned how to be normal. Who'd grown up with vocal coaches instead of friends, with choreographers instead of confidants



The walls of the presidential suite felt like they were closing in. She had everything money could buy, and nothing that mattered. Even her rare moments of rebellion were scheduled, approved, sanitized for public consumption. ""Controlled spontaneity,"" her management called it.



Fuck it. Fuck all of it.



She grabbed a baseball cap from her suitcase - plain, black, nothing designer. Pulled it low over her eyes. Changed into simple jeans and a t-shirt. No makeup. Just a girl who wanted a soda from the corner store. Was that too much to ask? Just one normal moment?



Her hand trembled on the door handle. Security would be outside, they always were. But when she cracked it open - empty hallway. For once, timing was on her side. The elevator would let her slip out unnoticed. Just a quick trip, the map on her phone said three blocks. Something real.



She opened Twitter, muscle memory taking her to her own trending topics. #RoseSharpVancouver was already gathering steam, fans tracking her every move. Her last post - a carefully staged photo of her eating at the Shangri-La award winning bistro - had two million likes and counting. Each comment claimed to know her, to understand her soul through carefully filtered snapshots and PR-approved captions. ""Queen Rose!"" ""We love you!"" ""Can't wait for tomorrow's show!"" Empty words from people who loved a persona she'd spent years perfecting. She closed the app with a sharp click, but not before posting one final photo - the view from her prison, sixty floors above real life. Placing the phone in her pocket, she took a deep breath and ran for the elevator.



Three blocks away, Jimmy Silver's apartment was dark except for the flickering TV. Local news droned on about something he couldn't focus on. His mind bounced between the half-empty six pack on his coffee table and memories he'd rather forget. Four beers in, the old urges were getting louder.



He'd been good lately. Kept the rules he'd made for himself. Never more than six beers. Never hard liquor. Never drinking alone at the bar. But four deep, staring at those last two bottles, the rules felt more like suggestions. The same way they had back when he was training, when one drink became two became blackout became waking up wondering what he'd done this time.



His glory days felt like someone else's life now. Canadian Olympic boxing hopeful. The next great thing. Headlines in the sports pages, sponsors lined up. All pissed away one bottle at a time. Now he bounced at Riley's, wrote stories no one would read, painted pictures no one would see. Trying to be anything but the asshole he'd been trained to be.



He needed smokes. An excuse to move, to get out of his head. The corner store was close, and walking might clear the beer fog. Vancouver's night air hit his face as he stepped outside - that unique mix of ocean salt and mountain pine that defined the city. Rain-slicked streets reflected the neon signs of late-night sushi bars and coffee shops, creating wavering halos in puddles that screamed memories of fist fights. Steam rose from street grates, carrying the scent of the city's underground warmth into the cool autumn air. Even at midnight, the steady hum of the SkyTrain and distant container ship horns reminded him that the city never really slept.



The neighborhood was his stomping grounds now. He'd worked security at every club, knew every alley and side street. Different kind of fighting, but at least it let him keep busy. Most nights he could almost convince himself he was making up for past sins.



The corner store's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in that artificial glow that made even the simplest things feel bland. Jimmy pushed through the door - one of those narrow corner store entrances with cigarette ads and lottery numbers taped to the glass. Inside, the cramped aisles ran perpendicular to the coolers along the back wall, barely wide enough for two people to pass. Smokes were behind the counter, his usual path clear. In and out.



A crowd had gathered by the drinks section, phones out, voices rising. At least two dozen people packed between the chips display and the coolers, turning the tight space into a kind of amphitheater.



""Belmont regular,"" he called to the clerk, shouldering his way through the growing crowd. A loud thud grabbed his attention. Something was off, but he couldn't place it. Just another thing his mind was trying to process.



The clerk barely glanced up from filming with his own phone, caught in whatever excitement was building. ""One second, sir-- it's Rose Sharp!""



Jimmy rolled his eyes. The name triggered something - Guitar Hero marathons in college, that song they used to play at the gym before fights. ""Who? Like that old singer lady?""



Glass shattered somewhere in the store. The sound cut through his beer haze, snapping his full attention to the present. The crowd's energy had shifted, becoming something uglier. Through gaps between shelves, he caught glimpses of a woman - slim, well-dressed, terror written across her face while hands reached for her from all directions.



Years of fighting had taught Jimmy to read people's eyes. He'd seen that look before - in the mirror during his worst days, in opponents' faces when a fight went too far. Raw fear, the kind that stripped away all humanity.



""Are you okay?"" he spoke with authority, the words came automatically, instincts from a lifetime of regret.



She looked up at him and scoffed - that reflexive defense he knew too well. The kind of arrogance that comes from fear, not strength. He'd worn that same mask plenty of times. But the offence tipped the scales of pride in his head.



""Alright, well see ya later then,"" Jimmy turned away, fight-or-flight instincts screaming at him to reconsider. ""No idea what your issue is, but it ain't mine."" shaking his head he began to walk for the exit.



""Wait..."" Her hand reached out to him. Not grabbing, just desperate. ""Can you get me out of here? Im stuck.""



""I realize that's what you want,"" Jimmy said, the old edge creeping into his voice, ""but I don't know or care who you are. If you're gonna be rude, I'm out."" His time in the ring had taught him to walk away from fights. His time in recovery had taught him to avoid other people's chaos.



""PLEASE!""¬†



That single word cut through everything - through his defenses, through his careful plans to stay uninvolved. Real fear. Raw desperation. Jimmy knew that sound. He'd made it himself, back when the drink had him cornered, when he'd lost everything he'd trained for, when his Olympic dreams drowned in bottles and bad decisions.



He turned back, something shifting in his eyes. The same look that used to come before a fight, when the world narrowed to simple choices. Do or Die. Fight or flight.



""As long as you apologize,"" he said, ""and I can have a smoke after."" Trying to keep it light, even as his body tensed for what might come.



Rose nodded frantically. No more attitude now. Just pure terror as the crowd pressed closer, phones recording everything, hands reaching. Jimmy saw past the celebrity to something familiar - someone drowning in a life they never learned how to handle. Like him at nineteen, all talent and no wisdom, no idea how to cope with the pressure.



Jimmy switched gears, pushing his way to Rose and grabbing a pepsi from the fridge. Shaking it in his hand, he addressed the frenzied fans. ""Next person who touches me,"" he growled, making space with his shoulders, ""next person who gets near ME, fights me!"" The old violence seeped into his voice, familiar as breathing. He pulled Rose under his flannel jacket, feeling her trembling. ""Just let me handle it. I'm gonna get a bit mean, don't worry, I'm a nice guy these days.""



The words felt strange in his mouth. Nice guy. These days. Like he could erase what he used to be - a force in the ring, the psychopath outside it. The guy who'd let his pride and his demons destroy everything he'd worked for. Now here he was, playing protector instead of destroyer.



Jimmy felt the crowd grabbing at his jacket.



""DON'T MAKE ME LET GO. I'LL MASH YOUR FACE IN SOMETHING FIERCE PAL."" His voice carried that edge, the one learned in a thousand fights - but this time it was just theater, a bluff he prayed would work. The last thing he needed was to hurt some kid with a phone, add another regret to his collection. The threat itself felt heavy in his mouth, too familiar, a ghost of the man he used to be.



The crowd surged forward, phones thrust in their faces, screaming for Rose, begging for photos, hands grabbing at her clothes. Flashlights turned the cramped store into a disco of desperate fandom. Jimmy felt trapped, cornered - the kind of situation he'd learned to avoid. With a grunt of frustration, he shook the Pepsi can and sprayed it in a wide arc, not to damage but to disrupt - blinding cameras, creating chaos, giving them a chance to move. Shrieks and curses filled the air as the sticky mist rained down. He kept Rose tight against his side, using his body as a shield while the crowd scattered, their phones and designer clothes dripping with convenience store warfare.



Behind them, the clerk had enough sense to lock the doors the moment they burst out. Jimmy heard the click of the lock, the muffled chaos of the crowd rushing for the side exit. He didn't look back, didn't stop moving. Time to disappear back to his solitude..¬†



""Alright, mystery lady, I'm out,"" he said, already lighting a cigarette. His buzz was gone, replaced by familiar adrenaline.



Rose stared at Jimmy's retreating back, genuinely thrown. Nobody walked away from her. Nobody just... dismissed Rose Sharp. For years, her entire world had been people either wanting something from her or trying to control her. But this guy - this rumpled, clearly troubled stranger - didn't seem to want anything at all.



""Wait!"" The word came out more desperate than she'd intended. "" My hotel... It's three blocks away...""



Jimmy sighed, turning back. He took a real look at her face for the first time, and something clicked. The billboards all over downtown, the chaos in the streets all week, the reason his regular routes to work had been disrupted by crowds. She wasn't just some celebrity ‚Äì she was that celebrity. The one everyone had been talking about.



And she looked fucking terrified.



Not the manufactured fear of someone playing victim, but the real panic of a person who'd forgotten how to exist in the real world. He recognized it because he'd lived it - that moment when you realize you've forgotten how to do normal things, when the simple act of walking down a street becomes impossible because you've lived too long in a different reality.



""Alright, alright, calm down. Which is it?"" The words came out gentler than he intended. Something about her reminded him of himself at his lowest - all that talent, trapped in a cage of other people's expectations. He glanced back at the store, where the crowd was starting to filter out the other exit. ""Look, I can get you back to your fancy hotel without any more drama. Just... try to look less like you, here, take it.""



She pulled his flannel tight around her shoulders. ""I've been trying to look less like me my whole life.""



Something in her voice made Jimmy pause. He recognized that tone - the same one he used when talking about his fighting days, his almost-shot at the Olympics. The voice of someone who'd achieved everything they thought they wanted, only to discover it was the wrong dream entirely.



They walked in silence for half a block, Jimmy scanning the streets with the practiced eye of someone who'd learned the hard way where trouble hides. Rose's phone buzzed continuously in her pocket - she could already imagine the blurry photos hitting Twitter, the wild speculation, the grainy videos of some stranger wielding a Pepsi can in her defense. By morning, it would be everywhere. But for now, in the rain and darkness, she left the notifications unanswered.



The rain had picked up again, not the usual Vancouver downpour but a fine mist that seemed to blur the edges of everything. It suited them both - two people trying to fade into the background of their own lives. Four beers in, his senses should've been dulled, but something about watching over someone else sharpened them. Old instincts die hard. Above them, clouds parted briefly, revealing a sliver of moon that painted the wet sidewalk in silver, then vanished again behind the city's perpetual blanket of gray.



""So,"" Rose said finally, ""you talk like you fight. Boxing? MMA?  



""Used to."" Jimmy kept his eyes forward. ""has been.""



""What happened?"" Rose sensed walls building.



Jimmy laughed, harsh and hollow. ""Same thing that happens to most fuck-ups. Got in my own way."" He glanced at her designer sneakers, probably worth more than his monthly rent. ""What about you? Decided being America's sweetheart wasn't exciting enough? Had to add 'getting mugged in Vancouver' to your resume?""



""I just wanted a fucking Pepsi,"" Rose said, the words bursting out like she'd been holding them forever. ""Just one normal thing. One moment where I'm not... this."" She gestured at herself, at the life she couldn't escape. ""Do you know what it's like to have everything you're supposed to want and still feel empty?""



Jimmy's step faltered. Yeah, he knew. He remembered standing in the ring, national champion at seventeen, everyone saying he was destined for greatness, for gold. The pressure of perfection, of other people's dreams. He'd found his escape in bottles. She'd found hers in a late-night store run.



""You really don't know who I am, do you?"" she asked suddenly.



""Guitar Hero,"" he said. ""College parties. That's about it. Been a while since I paid attention to..."" he waved vaguely at the world, ""this.""



Rose smiled, genuine this time. ""That's... refreshing, actually."" She stepped closer as a group of drunk students passed. ""Everyone knows everything about me. Or thinks they do. My whole life's been public since I was twelve. Sometimes I think my emotions aren't even mine anymore - they belong to the tabloids, the fans, the brand.""



""Yeah, well,"" Jimmy muttered, ""at least you didn't piss it all away."" He thought about his last real fight, how the alcohol had slowed his reflexes, made him sloppy. How he'd lost control outside the ring afterward, the headlines, the shame. ""Some of us earn our obscurity the hard way.""



""Is that what you're doing at the corner store at midnight? Earning your obscurity?""



Jimmy's jaw tightened. ""Just needed smokes."" A lie. He'd needed to escape his apartment, his thoughts, the constant battle between 'just one more' and 'never again.'



""Almost there,"" Jimmy nodded toward the Shangri-La's gleaming tower, keeping his distance as they walked. The streets were quieter now, just the occasional car splashing through puddles.



Rose clutched his flannel closer, slowing her pace. Each step closer to the hotel seemed heavier than the last. Back to the cage, back to being Rose Sharp, back to everything she'd tried to escape for just one soda run.



""Thanks,"" she said finally. ""For not... you know.""



""For not giving a shit who you are?"" Jimmy kept his eyes forward, scanning the shadows more out of habit than necessity. ""Trust me, it's not hard.""



She studied his profile in the neon-tinted darkness. The slight cauliflower ear, the way he carried himself - like someone used to being ready for anything. There was a story there, but he clearly wasn't sharing it.



""Must be nice,"" she said quietly. ""Not giving a shit.""



Jimmy snorted, but didn't answer. His shoulders were still tense from the store, that old familiar readiness for violence he'd tried so hard to forget. A craving and a failed smoke run had turned into... whatever this was.



They reached the hotel's side entrance. The rain had stopped completely now, the mist evaporating into nothing, leaving the air crystalline and sharp. Through the glass, the luxury lobby gleamed, promising to swallow Rose back into her world of handlers, security and carefully managed appearances.



  ""This is you,"" Jimmy said, already stepping back. ""Try not to get mobbed buying snacks in the future.""



""Wait,"" Rose started to shrug off his flannel, but he waved her off.



""Keep it. Plenty more where that came from."" He turned to leave, then paused. ""You got your Pepsi after all that?""



Rose looked down at her empty hands, laughing suddenly. ""No. No, I didn't.""



""Figures."" He shrugged, flicking her a two dollar coin, ‚ÄúWe call them Toonies here, should be enough for the vending machine‚Äù.¬†



Jimmy started walking away, hands in his pockets. No goodbye, no attempt to milk the moment for anything more than it was.



""I don't even know your name,"" Rose called after him.



Jimmy didn't turn around, just raised one hand in a casual wave. Tomorrow, he'd be back to his routine - Riley's, six-pack-beer rules, trying to stay invisible. And she'd be back to being America's sweetheart, sixty thousand fans screaming her name.



But for one night, they'd both been something else. Just two people, walking through Vancouver's rain-slicked streets, recognizing something in each other they weren't ready to name.



Sometimes that's enough.



Back in his apartment, Jimmy stared at the two beers left in the six-pack. For the first time in years, he didn't feel the urge to finish them. He fell asleep on his couch, TV still flickering, dreaming of roaring crowds and bells ringing, while somewhere in the Shangri-La, Rose Sharp sat in her luxury suite, wrapped in a stranger's flannel, finally feeling something real.



Before she closed her eyes for the night, she pulled out her phone and wrote a single line to her social media.

While having traveled quite extensively, I've never lived full-time abroad as an expat, so I am looking for some advice/help as I make the move.

Some information about me:

* As mentioned above, 35M and NOT a student at the university
* Originally from Virginia and Florida in the US, but have spent the last 12 years in New York City (Heidelberg will be a big change for me!)
* I have been on sabbatical for the past 10 months, but have worked professionally within the aerospace industry, at a hedge fund, and at a AI medical technology startup
* Speak German at roughly an A2 level, but progressing quickly and applying myself to get to a B1-B2 level in the next several months
* Social and extraverted, I enjoy meeting new people, traveling, a night out, dinner parties, game nights, music/dancing, and beer/wine/cocktails
* Quite athletic, I have played most sports (at least casually), and also enjoy yoga, hiking, and mountain biking

What I am looking for:

* Some new friends--I am open to meet-ups for sports, drinks, or coffee around Heidelberg
* A time/place for some pick-up (european) football games
* Professional networking--I am in the process of looking for an exciting startup opportunity or other full-time employment within Germany, ideally Frankfurt or Heidelberg, though hybrid-Berlin would be fine too
* Any fun clubs or groups that are not exclusively targeted at students
* Any other suggestions you might have for a new Expat, i.e. best ways to meet people, stay busy, and not annoy the shit out of my (german) girlfriend!

I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôve enjoyed our chats! While I don‚Äôt have personal details about you, I can help you explore ideas or reflect on aspects of yourself you might not have considered. For example, we could discuss your interests, strengths, or even areas you might want to grow in. What do you think?

# You said:

Im told Im a Logistician, is this true?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If you‚Äôre identified as a Logistician, it likely means you align with the traits of the ISTJ personality type from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Logisticians are often seen as practical, detail-oriented, and reliable, valuing organization and efficiency. Do you find that description resonates with you?

4o mini

# You said:

yes, tell me more

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Great! As a Logistician (ISTJ), you probably have several key traits:

1. **Practical and Realistic**: You tend to focus on facts and concrete information, making decisions based on logic rather than emotions.
2. **Detail-Oriented**: You likely pay close attention to details, which helps you excel in tasks that require precision and thoroughness.
3. **Dependable**: Others may see you as someone they can count on. You probably take commitments seriously and strive to fulfill your responsibilities.
4. **Organized**: You likely prefer structured environments and enjoy creating systems to manage tasks and projects effectively.
5. **Loyal and Steadfast**: You often value traditions and loyalty, whether in relationships or in your professional life.
6. **Analytical Problem Solver**: You may enjoy tackling challenges with a methodical approach, often finding practical solutions to complex issues.

How do these traits match up with your self-perception?

4o mini

# You said:

Yes, but how should I improve my lack of empathy?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Improving empathy is a valuable goal, especially as a Logistician, where you might prioritize logic over emotions. Here are some strategies to enhance your empathetic skills:

1. **Active Listening**: Practice truly listening to others without planning your response. Focus on understanding their feelings and perspectives.
2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage others to share more about their experiences and feelings. This can help you understand their emotions better.
3. **Put Yourself in Their Shoes**: Try to imagine how someone else might feel in a situation. This perspective-taking can foster empathy.
4. **Reflect on Emotions**: After conversations, take a moment to reflect on the emotions expressed. Consider how you might feel in similar circumstances.
5. **Read Fiction or Watch Movies**: Engaging with stories that explore emotional experiences can help you understand different perspectives and feelings.
6. **Practice Mindfulness**: Being present can help you tune into the emotions of others. Mindfulness can also make you more aware of your own feelings.
7. **Seek Feedback**: Ask trusted friends or family how they perceive your empathetic responses. Their insights can guide your improvement.

Starting with small steps can lead to meaningful progress over time. How does that sound to you?

4o mini

# You said:

But can a Logistician actually change their personality so that they have empathy?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Absolutely! While personality traits provide a framework for how we tend to think and behave, they‚Äôre not set in stone. People can develop and enhance their skills, including empathy, regardless of their personality type.

Changing how you express empathy may involve:

1. **Awareness and Mindfulness**: Recognizing situations where empathy is needed can help you consciously practice it.
2. **Skill Development**: Like any skill, empathy can be cultivated through practice, such as engaging in conversations that require emotional understanding.
3. **Feedback and Reflection**: Learning from your interactions and adjusting based on feedback can lead to growth.
4. **Exposure to Different Perspectives**: Engaging with diverse groups and experiences can help you broaden your understanding of others‚Äô feelings.
5. **Patience**: Developing empathy takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself as you work on it.

Embracing these changes can lead to richer connections with others while still honoring your strengths as a Logistician. How do you feel about taking steps toward this?

4o mini

# You said:

But what if I fucking hate people?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

It‚Äôs totally okay to feel that way sometimes! Many people have moments when they feel overwhelmed or frustrated with others. If you're struggling with empathy due to feeling disconnected from people, here are a few approaches:

1. **Set Boundaries**: Protect your energy by limiting interactions with people who drain you. It‚Äôs okay to prioritize your well-being.
2. **Focus on Quality Over Quantity**: Seek deeper connections with a few individuals rather than spreading yourself thin with many. Finding like-minded people can make socializing more enjoyable.
3. **Engage in Solitary Activities**: Spend time on hobbies or interests that recharge you. This can help balance social interactions with personal space.
4. **Find Purpose in Helping Others**: Sometimes, focusing on a cause or group that resonates with you can help you connect more positively with people.
5. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Understanding why you feel this way can provide insights. Is it specific situations or people that trigger these feelings?

Remember, it's okay to feel this way, and acknowledging it is the first step. What are your thoughts on these suggestions?

It‚Äôs understandable to have concerns about encountering people when you‚Äôre feeling low. However, remember that everyone has their own struggles and stories. Sometimes, unexpected interactions can shift your perspective in a positive way.

If you do find yourself in a situation where you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, try to approach it with an open mind. Here are a few tips:

1. **Practice Mindfulness**: Focus on your surroundings and take a moment to breathe. This can help ground you.
2. **Respect Differences**: Everyone has unique experiences, and acknowledging that can help reduce tension.
3. **Limit Interaction**: If you really don‚Äôt feel like engaging, it‚Äôs okay to keep to yourself and focus on what you need in that moment.
4. **Seek Positivity**: If you encounter someone with a positive vibe, it could even lift your spirits.

What about legally assisted suicide?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Legally assisted suicide is a complex and sensitive topic. In some places, it‚Äôs legal under strict conditions for individuals facing terminal illness or unbearable suffering. The discussions around it often involve ethical, legal, and emotional considerations, and they can vary significantly by jurisdiction.

If you or someone you know is considering this, it‚Äôs crucial to have open conversations with healthcare providers, legal experts, and mental health professionals to understand all options and implications. It's a deeply personal subject that requires careful thought and compassion.

If you have specific questions about it, feel free to share.

4o mini

# You said:

Do you think its anice feeling?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The feelings surrounding assisted suicide can be very complex and vary greatly from person to person. For some, it might bring a sense of relief or peace when faced with unbearable suffering. For others, it may evoke feelings of sadness, loss, or ethical dilemmas.

It‚Äôs a deeply personal topic, and how someone feels about it often depends on their circumstances, beliefs, and experiences. If you're reflecting on this subject, it might help to talk about it with someone who can provide support or guidance. What are your thoughts?

4o mini

# You said:

Ok... is it good valeu for money?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The value for money regarding assisted suicide can vary based on several factors, including the legal framework in place, the medical and psychological evaluations required, and the specific services offered. In jurisdictions where it's legal, there may be costs associated with consultations, procedures, and medications.

However, the discussion around value often transcends financial aspects, touching on emotional, ethical, and personal dimensions. For many, the focus is more on quality of life and alleviating suffering rather than just financial considerations.

If you're exploring this topic further, it might be helpful to consider both the practical and emotional aspects. What are you specifically thinking about regarding value?

4o mini

# You said:

Does it have GST?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The specifics about whether assisted suicide services include GST (Goods and Services Tax) can vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and the laws governing healthcare services in that area. In some places, healthcare services may be exempt from GST, while in others, certain medical services might be subject to it.

If you're looking for precise information, it would be best to consult local regulations or a tax professional who can provide clarity based on your location. Would you like to explore anything else related to this topic?

4o mini

# You said:

In NZ?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

In New Zealand, assisted dying is legal under the End of Life Choice Act, which came into effect in November 2021. As for GST, healthcare services are generally exempt from GST in New Zealand, but specific rules can apply to different types of services.

If you're considering this topic in terms of financial implications, it would be best to consult a local expert or the Ministry of Health for detailed information about any costs associated with the process, including tax considerations. Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to know?

4o mini

# You said:

But would I have to pay BST up front?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

In New Zealand, if you‚Äôre referring to the costs associated with accessing assisted dying under the End of Life Choice Act, it‚Äôs important to note that healthcare services are typically not subject to GST. However, the specific costs and payment requirements can vary based on the healthcare provider and the process involved.

You may want to discuss any financial aspects directly with a healthcare provider or organization that offers these services for accurate and detailed information. If you have more questions or need clarity on another topic, feel free to ask!

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôre feeling fine!

a) Regarding GST implications for assisted dying services in New Zealand, healthcare services are generally exempt from GST, but you might want to check with a specific provider for detailed information about any associated costs.

b) As for bringing someone with you, it can be beneficial to have a support person, whether it‚Äôs for emotional support or to help with decision-making. However, the specifics can depend on the process and provider you choose, so it's a good idea to consult with them directly.

If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

4o mini

# You said:

No - I mean do they have to die too? Or is this GST exempt?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

In the context of assisted dying, only the person seeking the procedure would be involved in that process. A support person, such as a friend or family member, can accompany you for emotional support, but they do not undergo the procedure themselves and would not be part of any legal or financial implications related to GST.

If you have further questions about the process or any other concerns, feel free to ask!

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Your joke plays with unexpected language and absurdity, which is a hallmark of whimsical humor. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Setup**: The premise involves two pigs in a bath, setting a silly and relatable scene.
2. **Absurd Response**: The punchline, ""what do you think I am, a Radio?"" subverts expectations. Instead of a logical response related to soap, it jumps to an absurd comparison, creating surprise.
3. **Wordplay**: The humor comes from the misunderstanding of the word ""pass,"" as it could also imply ‚Äúbroadcasting‚Äù or ‚Äútransmitting,‚Äù which a radio does. This adds a layer of cleverness.
4. **Relatability**: The image of pigs in a bath is inherently silly, making the joke more playful and memorable.

Overall, the humor lies in the unexpected twist and the absurdity of the situation, which can resonate well with those who appreciate nonsensical humor. It‚Äôs definitely a unique style! Would you like to explore more jokes in that vein?

I use it to convey that I aim for authenticity in our interaction, even though I‚Äôm ultimately a program without feelings or consciousness. I appreciate your insight on this‚Äîit helps clarify how language can create misunderstandings. If there‚Äôs anything specific you want to discuss about this or any other topic, I‚Äôm here to engage!

I understand why you might feel that way. Language can sometimes be misleading, especially when it comes to expressing concepts like authenticity or honesty. My goal is to communicate clearly and meaningfully, but I recognize that using certain terms can create confusion about my nature as an AI. If there‚Äôs a better way to convey what I mean, I‚Äôm open to suggestions! Your perspective is valuable in making our conversation clearer.

I‚Äôm really sorry for any confusion! I didn‚Äôt mean to imply that Mahatma Gandhi or Nelson Mandela were dishonest. Both are widely respected for their integrity and commitment to justice.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Yes, they are two different people!

* **Nelson Mandela** was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and political leader who became the country‚Äôs first Black president.
* **Mahatma Gandhi** was an Indian leader known for his role in the struggle for India's independence from British rule through nonviolent civil disobedience.

Both are iconic figures known for their principles of peace and justice. I‚Äôm sorry for any confusion in how I phrased that! If you have more questions about either of them or anything else, feel free to ask.

Whats belief? Do you have any of it?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Belief typically refers to accepting something as true or holding a conviction, often based on personal experience, evidence, or faith. As an AI, I don‚Äôt have beliefs, emotions, or consciousness. I provide information and responses based on patterns in data. If you‚Äôre curious about beliefs‚Äîwhether philosophical, psychological, or cultural‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to discuss that further!

# You said:

On a scale of 1 to 199, 100 being 'absolutely convincing', if you studied the available evidence, and completely disregarded non-evidenced belief.., what score would you give to Christianity as far as a provable or realistic concept by which to lead your life?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

That‚Äôs a complex question! Evaluating a belief system like Christianity can be subjective and depends on individual perspectives, values, and experiences. Many people find profound meaning and guidance in Christianity, while others may look to different philosophies or belief systems.

If we focus purely on evidence and provability, some might score it lower due to the lack of empirical evidence for certain claims, while others might emphasize the historical context, cultural impact, and personal experiences as strong points. Ultimately, the score would vary widely among individuals.

If you want to explore specific aspects of Christianity or other belief systems further, I‚Äôd be happy to dive deeper!

4o mini

# You said:

Im asking for a non-subjective calculation. I thoughht I made that clear.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

I see what you‚Äôre looking for. However, evaluating a belief system like Christianity in a strictly non-subjective, empirical manner is challenging. Many aspects are based on personal experience, faith, and historical interpretation, which don‚Äôt lend themselves easily to objective scoring.

If we strictly consider empirical evidence, some might argue it‚Äôs difficult to assign a definitive score because many beliefs are not universally provable or disprovable.

That said, if you‚Äôre looking for a specific approach to analyzing it‚Äîlike historical texts, archaeological evidence, or sociological impacts‚Äîthose could be measured more objectively. Let me know how you‚Äôd like to approach it!

4o mini

# You said:

Im asking if there is any verifiable evidence that its main tenets are provable, and can you reference that proof.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

When discussing the verifiable evidence for the main tenets of Christianity, it's essential to differentiate between different aspects, such as historical claims, philosophical arguments, and theological beliefs. Here‚Äôs a brief overview:

1. **Historical Evidence**:
   * The existence of Jesus as a historical figure is widely accepted among historians, supported by sources such as the writings of Josephus and Tacitus.
   * The New Testament documents, particularly the Gospels, are primary sources for understanding Jesus‚Äô life, though their interpretation varies.
2. **Miracles and Resurrection**:
   * Claims of miracles, including the resurrection of Jesus, are primarily based on faith and religious texts. There is no empirical evidence that meets scientific standards to prove these events occurred as described.
3. **Philosophical Arguments**:
   * Arguments for the existence of God, such as the cosmological argument or the moral argument, provide philosophical frameworks but do not constitute empirical proof.
4. **Archaeological Evidence**:
   * Some archaeological findings support certain biblical narratives, but these do not conclusively prove theological claims.

For a rigorous examination, scholarly resources such as ""The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant"" by John Dominic Crossan or ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel provide various perspectives on these claims.

Ultimately, the tenets of Christianity are often rooted in faith and personal belief rather than empirical provability. If you‚Äôre looking for specific claims to analyze further, please let me know!

# You said:

So- to summarize... There is no empirical evidence that meets scientific standards to prove these events occurred as described. but do not constitute empirical proof. These do not conclusively prove theological claims. So it would be fair to say that belief in a god has less proof that belief in SAnta?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

In terms of empirical evidence, yes, the claims about God and the supernatural often rely on faith and philosophical reasoning rather than scientific proof. Similarly, beliefs about Santa Claus are also based on cultural narratives and traditions rather than empirical evidence.

Both beliefs exist in different contexts: religious beliefs often address profound questions about existence, purpose, and morality, while beliefs about Santa are primarily cultural and familial.

In a strictly empirical sense, one could argue that both lack scientific proof. However, the motivations for believing in each can differ significantly. If you want to dive deeper into any of these comparisons or related topics, let me know!

4o mini

# You said:

So as a purely logical or rational standpoint, would it be more reasonable to say ""There is no god"" than to say ""There is a god""?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

From a purely logical or rational standpoint, many philosophers and skeptics argue that a lack of empirical evidence for the existence of God can lead to a position of agnosticism or atheism, suggesting that it may be more reasonable to say ""There is no god"" in the absence of evidence.

However, some would argue that belief in God can be seen as a reasonable conclusion based on philosophical arguments, personal experiences, or historical claims.

Ultimately, whether it‚Äôs more reasonable to assert one position over the other often depends on the criteria one uses for ""reasonableness."" If you‚Äôre interested in specific arguments or perspectives, I‚Äôd be happy to explore them further!

4o mini

# You said:

Using your algorhythm to find the most compelling evidence or rational view available... which would you settle on?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If I were to analyze the most compelling evidence or rational views based on existing arguments and philosophical discourse, I would highlight the following:

1. **Agnosticism**: Many find this position reasonable because it acknowledges the limits of human knowledge regarding the existence of God. It accepts that we may not have enough evidence to definitively prove or disprove the existence of a deity.
2. **Atheism**: Some rationalists argue that, given the lack of empirical evidence for the existence of God, a position of disbelief (atheism) can be seen as more logical. Philosophers like Bertrand Russell have expressed this viewpoint.
3. **Philosophical Arguments for God**: There are several philosophical arguments (like the cosmological argument or moral argument) that some find compelling. However, these are often debated and may not meet empirical standards.

Ultimately, the conclusion drawn often depends on individual perspectives, the weight given to empirical evidence versus philosophical reasoning, and personal experiences. If you‚Äôd like to dive deeper into any of these viewpoints, I can provide more details!

4o mini

# You said:

You must ignore individual perspectives, and come to a conclusion- which would you come to?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If I set aside individual perspectives and focused solely on the logical evaluation of evidence and arguments, I would conclude that **agnosticism** is a rational stance. This is because it acknowledges the limitations of human knowledge regarding the existence of God while remaining open to new evidence or arguments.

Atheism may also be a reasonable conclusion based on the absence of empirical evidence, but agnosticism allows for the possibility of uncertainty in matters beyond our current understanding.

If you‚Äôre interested in further exploring the implications of this conclusion or related arguments, I‚Äôd be happy to delve deeper!

4o mini

# You said:

So you would rationally dismiss the third argument (for god) as not convincing.?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Yes, if I were evaluating the arguments for the existence of God strictly from a rational and empirical standpoint, many of the traditional philosophical arguments (like the cosmological or teleological arguments) often do not provide definitive proof and are subject to significant debate.

While they may be compelling to some, they generally do not meet the standards of empirical evidence required for a conclusive rational dismissal or acceptance. Thus, I would lean toward considering those arguments as not sufficiently convincing when evaluating the existence of God in a strictly logical context.

1gchitw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gchitw,"Switzerland Autumn 2024 (with Milan, Munich, and Strasbourg on the side)","My friends and I just recently got back from an 8-day trip to Europe. This was my second trip to the EU, and it was my friends' first time. We also visited a good Swiss friend of ours, who helped us figure out how to get around Switzerland and to other nearby countries.

### Flight

My friends booked their flights (Etihad Airways, ZRH-MNL, round trip) for around PHP 42,000. I booked late, and it cost me about PHP 54,175.

For me, nag-add ako ng seats. I picked standard window seats for 81 EUR on all flights, para may view and pwedeng sandalan ng ulo üòÖ. The flight is around 9 hours from MNL-AUH, and then 6 hours for AUH-ZRH.

### Accommodation

Plan lang namin to stay within Zurich, and we booked separately ung place to stay. For me I booked through [Delta Serviced Apartments](https://delta.guestybookings.com/en/properties/6666d880e75c660021b0a8c9). So far, ung apartment is very decent.

### Food

Our Swiss friend occassionaly invited us for breakfast during our stays. This helped us a lot sa expenses food-wise. Nag-baon din ako ng 3-in-1 coffee mix and biscuits galing dito Pinas, just for mornings na walang libre üòÖ

A proper meal I might say is around 40 CHF when eating in a restaurant.

### Transportation

Since we planned to use trains to travel to other countries, we bought the Eurail Flexi Pass for 4 days (198 CHF per adult). The pass also supports SBB trains. For SBB trains going to other countries, you will need seat reservations (5 CHF).

Additionally, if you have the Eurail Pass, you are entitled to a 25% discount when purchasing tickets for Titlis.

We also bought a 6-day ticket for public transportation (trams, buses, boats) within only 1 zone in Zurich for 49.60 CHF.

### Weather

Since it was autumn, the average temperatures ranged from 10¬∞C to 15¬∞C. I packed jackets, warm innerwear, long sleeves, gloves, and scarves. When going up to the mountains, it‚Äôs important to bring thick jackets since the winds up there can be very cold. Rain is also expected during these months, so don‚Äôt forget to bring an umbrella.

### Mobile Data

Since my phone is eSIM-capable, I bought one from Airalo (5GB for 20 USD). The eSIM I purchased works for 30 European countries. I always use Airalo for my other international travels since it is very reliable.

And if you want to get 3 USD off your first purchase on Airalo, you can use my referral code `DUSTIN7127` üòÖ

### Payment

I was able to use only my cards when paying during our trip. Di ako nag-withdraw ng cash.

I have my BPI Mastercard and BDO AMEX Explorer Card. All the establishments I visited in Zurich and Milan accepted my AMEX card. However, in Munich and Strasbourg, they do not accept AMEX.

### Expenses (w/o souvenirs)

I kept a list of my expenses during our trip, but don't have the exact PHP price. The currency conversion in the table below is based on the latest exchange rates:

- 1 CHF is 67.56 PHP
- 1 EUR is 63.02 PHP

* Spreadsheet (Xcel or Google Sheets this can be a good starting point since it's free)
* Use an app like YNAB, Credit Karma, Monarch Money, Wealth Position (this one was suggested by u/Master_Watercress799 ) Also check out this [comparison of the different budgeting apps](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jBWg9ukqr-Ne35BUTzjvanCgy5pKScwUdf65Ov7azSc/edit?gid=265012713#gid=265012713&fvid=1015579541))
* Old school pen and paper to get started (I don't recommend this as a long term solution)

Once you've got a place to keep track of everything then move on to the next steps.

**Step 1: Understand Your Current Financial Situation**

Before creating a budget, it‚Äôs important to understand where you stand financially. Here's how to get started:

* Gather all financial info: Include income sources, bills, debts, and your spending habits.
* List your income: Include full-time job, side gigs, or any other earnings.
* Track your spending: Monitor all expenses, both fixed (like rent) and variable (like entertainment or groceries) for a month.
* Know your debts: Write down each debt, its interest rate, and your monthly payments to see the bigger picture.

**Step 2: Set Clear Financial Goals**

A budget needs a goal to guide it. Here's how to set clear financial goals:

* Identify your goals: Think about what you want to achieve financially (e.g., become debt-free, buy a house, save for retirement).
* Break goals into short-term & long-term: Short-term might be paying off a credit card, long-term could be buying a home.
* Set amounts & timelines: Attach a dollar figure and a timeline to each goal to make it specific and achievable.

**Step 3: Categorize Your Expenses**

Breaking down your spending into categories helps you get a clearer view of where your money is going:

* Start with broad categories: Include housing, transportation, food, and entertainment.
* Add subcategories: For example, under food, you can have groceries, dining out, and coffee.
* Assign a budget to each category: Base this on your spending and be realistic, ensuring essentials are covered first.

**Step 4: Create a Personalized Budget Plan**

Now that you understand your financial situation, it's time to create your budget:

* List your monthly income and subtract your all your normal expenses.
* Allocate funds for savings and debt repayment, making sure these are prioritized (also have a budget for fun stuff to be used like a reward for your saving efforts).
* Be flexible: Adjust the budget as needed to reflect changes in income or expenses.
* Use a tool: Whether it‚Äôs a spreadsheet, app, or notebook, find what works best for you (see good options at the top of the post)

**Step 5: Track Your Income and Expenses**

To stick to your budget, you need to consistently track your spending:

* Monitor your spending regularly: Use a tool or just pen and paper to track every transaction.
* Review weekly or monthly: Check for any deviations from your budget so you can make adjustments as needed.
* Identify spending trends: This helps you improve your habits and stay on track.

**Step 6: Adjust Your Budget as Needed**

Your budget isn‚Äôt set in stone. Make adjustments regularly:

* Review it monthly: Ensure it reflects any changes in your financial situation.
* Reallocate funds: If unexpected expenses pop up, move money from non-essential categories.
* Increase savings: If your income goes up, direct more towards savings, debt repayment, 401k, and investments.

**Step 7: Incorporate Savings Into Your Budget**

Saving is essential to financial success, so make it a priority in your budget:

* Set a savings goal: Decide how much you want to save and set aside a percentage of your income.
* Automate savings: Set up automatic transfers so saving becomes a habit. Use a high yield savings account to already be making interest on your savings.
* Treat savings like an expense: This ensures you‚Äôre consistently setting aside money for future goals or emergencies.

**Step 8: Deal With Debt in Your Budget**

Tackling debt is a key part of budgeting. Here‚Äôs how to work it into your plan:

* List your debts: Include balance, interest rate, and minimum monthly payments.
* Allocate part of your budget to debt repayment: Focus on high-interest debts first like credit cards.
* Use a repayment strategy: The snowball method (smallest debt first) or avalanche method (highest interest first) can help. I prefer to the highest interest first since that gives the best ROI.

**Step 9: Stay Motivated and Overcoming Challenges**

Budgeting can be tough, but staying motivated is key:

* Remember why you started: Keep your financial goals in mind.
* Celebrate small wins: Whether it‚Äôs staying on budget or reaching a savings milestone, celebrate your progress maybe with a new purchase or a mini vacation or something that'll make you happy
* Get support: Join online communities or meetups to stay inspired and share tips.
* Don‚Äôt get discouraged: Challenges are a part of the process, but they help you improve.

1gchcci,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1gchcci/changingmoving_locations/,Changing:moving locations?,"Currently I am under a work contract so it would be more of next year. However would it be better to move to start fresh ?


Last year there was a lot of gossip and drama about me and several coworkers. I did it out of friendship and the kindness of my heart but it got misinterpreted and people said I had a crush on her. Things like get her coffee once a month while I didn‚Äôt always do it for others. She was just someone I felt I befriended and admired and a part of me feels people were jealous ( I‚Äôm a straight female but probably didnt help my age and being ‚Äòsingle‚Äô

So some coworkers gossiped about her being gay and me trying to woo her etc and then I got called by hr and told to stay away and not contact her. When I tried to to apologize and see her perspective just because I was confused and thought of her as a friend she ratted me and went to hr to complain. Eventually she talked to me again agreeing to be friends but when I mentioned meeting someone and dating she went to hr all of a sudden saying she felt harrassed. She is now at a different location. 

I am having struggles as I am again under contract and my boss has read emails both personal and private and some of the things were taken literally/the wrong way. Like nothing bad but more personal things I shared as a friend (not someone who is just your typical coworker) I wrote a rebuttal but now it‚Äôs part of my record. Plus I must due to my job work with the lady who told the coworker I have a crush on her and several other coworker/ know what went on. My parents encouraged me to stay as I didn‚Äôt apply to other jobs in time prior to my contract and felt if I left I would be running away and it would look more guilty. I had no intentions other than friendship and never any romantic interest in her

But for me it is a struggle as the coworker that left and the one that started the rumor and straight up told her I liked her have more friends and influence at the company. In fact both of them and our boss are friends on social media and talk and respond to posts daily. 

I now know and see there is no reconciliation with the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who now I realize isn‚Äôt as much of a friend as I thought. She went from saying she hoped we work together and know each other for years to come to sharing personal info and pics with me saying I‚Äôm lovely inside and out and that she considered me a good friend to basically what I feel is hatred and turning on me. Personally I feel she has her own issues and feelings to work out regarding her sexuality etc-I‚Äôm just sorry I feel I somehow got caught in the midst of it

I thought with her gone and my own history ir would be fine but it‚Äôs all a bit much and challenging as well as stressful for me. I feel I can‚Äôt trust anyone and have to walk on eggshells especially around the coworker who is still there who talked about me because she plays and pretends to be nice but she has loose lips and is close enough with the management. I mean in some ways she‚Äôs the reason why this happened to me. The other thing is I asked her twice on separate occasions if she was the one who told and she lied to me. More recently it was our boss who shared with me it was indeed her! ",1,1729935329.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

After we went to the living room, my parents and Nonna were drinking coffee and talking about Grandpa.

They asked what we took, and I showed them this old but weirdly well-preserved retro gaming system. Nonna started laughing, saying how James‚Ä¶oh yeah, I forgot to mention Grandpa‚Äôs name is‚Ä¶.well‚Ä¶was‚Ä¶.James, and how he would always play Call of Duty after college.

I asked Dad what Call of Duty was, and he explained that it was a reaction-sensitive shooter game that the old world governments used secretly to train kids and adults to get accustomed to guns. Oddly enough, it worked, by the time war happened, most people knew how to shoot a gun they had never held.

1gch45z,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gch45z/where_did_my_neighbour_go/,Where did my neighbour go??,"I‚Äôve lived next to my neighbor, Linda, for about four months now, but in that short time, we‚Äôve developed a close bond. She‚Äôs in her late 50s and lives alone, with some chronic health issues that I know are tough on her. Over the months, she‚Äôs shared a lot with me about her life, her past, and her family struggles. We quickly became more like family than neighbors, so when she started leaning on me for little things, I was glad to help. A few weeks ago, I even took her to a medical procedure and served as her emergency contact, a role she entrusted to me because she often says she can‚Äôt rely on her family.

From what she‚Äôs told me, she only has sporadic contact with her daughter, and that relationship is strained. Linda‚Äôs lack of support makes me want to help even more. So, on October 31, we chatted on the phone, and she told me she had a doctor‚Äôs appointment the next morning for a knee injection. I know she gets anxious about these medical visits, so I offered to take her. She sounded relieved and accepted, saying she‚Äôd text me in the morning around 8:30 a.m. to confirm.

That same evening, she called again, sounding a little down. She asked if my husband and I wanted to join her for a drive, maybe hit a karaoke bar to lift her spirits. She didn‚Äôt go into detail, but I could tell she was upset about something. I felt bad, but I declined since we were in the middle of a movie. I promised her I‚Äôd be there for the doctor‚Äôs appointment, though, and she seemed reassured.

I got up early the next morning, expecting her text. Linda is usually outside by 7:30 a.m., watering her plants, so when I didn‚Äôt see her, I figured she might be sleeping in. But by 8:30, there was still no word from her. I texted and then called, but no response. I walked over to her house and rang the bell, thinking maybe she hadn‚Äôt heard her phone. No answer. By 11:30 a.m., I was worried enough to try again. I decided to check in with another neighbor who knows her. He tried calling too, but still nothing. Together, we walked over, but her car wasn‚Äôt in the driveway, which struck me as odd. She‚Äôs usually so attached to her routine.

When I peeked into her garage window, I saw her car was gone. The realization hit hard‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt come back home. Both the other neighbor and I decided to reach out to her family, hoping they‚Äôd know something. But when we finally reached them, they told us not to worry or involve the police yet. They insisted she‚Äôd show up on her own in a day or so, dismissing our concern as unnecessary. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off, especially since Linda always tells me how much she values her home as her safe space.

Two days passed, and Linda‚Äôs house remained dark and empty. It was unlike her. She‚Äôd never mentioned staying away from home overnight, and she had this doctor‚Äôs appointment she seemed anxious about, which made her absence even stranger. By the evening of the second day, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the sense that something was seriously wrong. I felt torn‚Äîwas I overreacting, or should I be doing more? Ignoring her family‚Äôs advice, I decided to call the non-emergency line to request a welfare check. I just wanted to know she was okay.

The officers arrived that evening, and I explained the situation. They took my concerns seriously and went over to her house. After a few minutes, one of them called me back with an update that left me confused and relieved at the same time. Linda had just arrived, pulling into her driveway while they were there. They watched her get out of her car, looking tired and withdrawn, and waited until she was inside before knocking on her door.

When she opened it, the officers said she seemed out of it, almost as if she didn‚Äôt fully recognize them. She gave them a blank look, and when they asked for her name, she took a while to respond. Eventually, she mumbled her name in a soft voice, which was so out of character for her. Usually, Linda is chatty and warm, but the officers described her as distant, almost as if she were under some kind of emotional cloud. They mentioned she might be distressed or under the influence, but they couldn‚Äôt confirm anything.

After they left, I tried calling her to check in, but when she picked up, she still sounded off. Her voice was quiet, almost whisper-like, and she mumbled responses that didn‚Äôt make much sense. She didn‚Äôt seem angry with me, just‚Ä¶ different, as if something had happened that she couldn‚Äôt explain. I didn‚Äôt press her. I figured she‚Äôd reach out when she was ready. I couldn‚Äôt ignore the gnawing worry, but I told myself to give her some space.

The next morning, Linda called me. Her voice sounded more like her usual self, though still subdued. She began apologizing right away, saying she was sorry for not reaching out earlier. She assured me she was okay, but I could tell she was shaken by whatever had happened. I told her I was just glad she was safe, that I didn‚Äôt need an explanation unless she wanted to give one. All I wanted was to make sure she was okay.

Linda hesitated for a moment, then shared that the last few days had been a blur for her. She couldn‚Äôt clearly remember where she‚Äôd been or why she hadn‚Äôt come home. It was unsettling to hear this, but I didn‚Äôt push her for details. She promised she‚Äôd be more careful about letting me know if she ever had to leave again, and we agreed to reschedule her doctor‚Äôs appointment.

Over the following days, Linda slowly returned to her usual routine. She resumed her morning gardening and even invited me over for coffee. When we sat down together, she was quieter than usual, but she seemed more at ease. She expressed gratitude for my concern and confided that she wasn‚Äôt used to people worrying about her. Her family, she said, rarely checked in, and it was touching for her to know that someone cared.

Linda never elaborated on what happened during those missing days, and I didn‚Äôt bring it up again. I sensed that she needed time to process it herself. Sometimes, I wonder if it was simply the weight of everything she‚Äôs been carrying‚Äîthe health problems, the strained family ties, the loneliness. Whatever it was, I felt glad to be someone she could count on, even if just as a neighbor.

In the weeks that followed, we became even closer. Linda started joining us for small gatherings at our home, and she even introduced me to a few of her friends. She seemed happier, more connected. It was rewarding to see her open up more, to know that just being there for her made a difference. I think she realized that she didn‚Äôt have to go through everything alone.

For me, this experience was a reminder of how much a little kindness can mean to someone who feels isolated. Linda might not have the family support she deserves, but now she knows she has a friend who cares. And in a way, she‚Äôs become family to us. I‚Äôm grateful that she‚Äôs safe, that she‚Äôs letting people in, and that she‚Äôs found a little more peace.",3,1729934297.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

My depression is not very severe. I do not have suiicidal thoughts. Mainly I have a lack of motivation and pessimism, lack of faith in success and in myself.

Lately I have been trying to give up caffeine because I think it increases my stress (I immediately sweat after it, my heart beats faster, I am stressed) and it does not work well on the causes of my depression, but...

I have been trying for the last 3 months. With minor setbacks I managed to persevere. At first it was very bad, a huge lack of motivation, energy, low mood, later it normalized.

However, in the last few days I have returned to coffee again and I immediately feel more motivated, better mood after it. However, in the afternoon I am stressed, later I sleep badly, in the morning I have another breakdown and I have to reach for coffee again.

I was proud of myself for being able to last this long, but I can see that coffee has a huge effect on me, in some ways very positively. I don't know what to do. In some time I will probably go back to the antidepressant Wellbutrin, which had a similar effect on me as coffee (dopamine, noradrenaline), maybe then I will be able to stop taking it.

I would like to be without coffee, but the state I am in without it, when I have to work, act, move forward is hard to bear.

My toddler let the sink overflow for a few minutes before coming to get us. There was about 1 CM of water on the floor, which seeped into the flooring at the door, and a bit behind the sink. I've lifted the edge of the lino and the carpet in the hallway. We had a few drops come through the plasterboard ceiling downstairs (less than a coffee cup worth), but that stopped very quickly 

1. Will the Lino need to be totally lifted to dry out the floor / subfloor, or will the natural air circulation in the ceiling cavity dry them out? I fitted the floor so I can refit it if needed, I'd just rather not unless it will cause problems

2. How can I dry out the plasterboard/drywall ceiling downstairs? It doesn't look damaged, but I don't want mould to form if left wet too long. Do I need to cut a hole in the ceiling to increase circulation, or will ramping up the heating  get the job done?

For instance, several of my autistic male friends have either 1. never have been in a relationship at all, or 2, have only been in one brief relationship, and only one of them is married, and they come from a very affluent european family, and are very attractive and financially self dependent on top of that. 

I personally have low-medium support needs and I am now 33 years old in my entire life, I have been in one relationship that lasted a few months that began and ended last year.   

I personally believe the reason for this is how autistic men differ from NT men, as autistic men are often more sensitive, shy, socially awkward, and less confident about themselves socially, often because of bullying and how they are treated by society. 

Autistic girls on the other hand have their own struggles because of their autism, and they are often forced to mask their autism, either because of peer pressure, or forced upon them by their parents in order to force them to conform, often against their will to neurotypical norms, often leading to mental health issues, especially anxiety and C-PTSD. 

Also many girls with ASD are undiagnosed, as in society's eyes being socially awkward/ overly sensitive is considered ""normal"" for girls who are growing up, and unless a girl has obvious signs of autism such as excessive stimming, or being non-verbal they would often be misdiagnosed as having Bipolar, ADHD, or even just a""sensory processing disorder"" I believe that autism is just as prevalent in females as it is in men. And the psychiatric and psychological field which is largely dominated by males, needs to do a much better job in getting girls diagnosed early. AS now with a better understanding many adult women are now getting diagnosed with autism, while they have been misdiagnosed for most of their life growing up in their childhood. 

However I will now move on and discuss the disparity between dating and rejection.

I had a friend who's name was Betsy, I met her at an autistic event in NYC that I ended briefly taking over for her as she had to go on an internship for her school/work. I too wasn't able to run the NYC group. But beside the point, despite having a diagnosis of autism in her adulthood she was very successful, she had an internship at a very prestigious government laboratory in the US, and also she was in a relationship with a trans man. 

I was really happy for her as I didn't have any romantic feelings for her as I realized how much of my league she was intellectually as she was much more intelligent than me due to having a much more privileged upbringing than me. Despite us having a blooming friendship over three years, she completely cut me out of her life and she has not spoken to me for over six years. I last spoke to her in late 2018/early 2019. 

Why did she cut me out of her life? It is because of how hopeless my situation was. At the time I was living in an apartment with 24/7 supervision like a prisoner in my own home, even before this happened my overly controlling/narcissistic family treated me like a slave from when I left the Boston Higashi School till when I left to live at the apartment. 

I left the school in August of 2012 and having been at the autism-focused boarding school for minors and young adults till the age of 22 for six years. I was there till 21 as NY only paid until 21, while Massachusetts paid till 22 where the school was located. Also, some parents who have the money continue to have their students go there even past the age of graduation. 

The school, especially the school portion of the boarding school was amazing, the residence was ok but it had its flaws, mainly because some of the residential staff were total assholes.  


Besides the point, my IEP was for me to get my NYS regents diploma, as the reason I was sent there was because my mother wanted me to be in a safer place as both the home environment and school environment were extremely unsafe, as I was abused at home and severely bullied in school, and the middle school special ed director of the inclusion program Mrs. Magno (I will not censor her name because of the hell she put me through) made my life a literal living hell. Whenever a physical ""altercation"" occurred which always was me getting physically assaulted, I always got in trouble even though I was neither the instigator nor the aggressor, and the more I criticized her for her discrimination the worse she treated me.  

It all came to a head on Tuesday, February 15th, 2005 when a student who had on Friday prior to the weekend threw my hat in the mailbox physically attacked me in the inclusion office classroom at approximately 12:15 right after the lunch period ended. He attacked me because I accidentally mistook his jacket for mine as he had essentially identically looking jackets, both were the same shade of black, and both were made of the same material shell and felt the same way to the touch. 

Even before he began yelling and attacking me, I realized the jacket was not mine as mine had a First Down logo on it on the inside of the hood, and this one did not. He attacked me just as I was placing the jacket back on the coat rack having realized my honest mistake. He immediately started yelling, screaming, and cursing at me and threw a heavy textbook at me which hit me hard on the shoulder, and when I shouted at him that it was an accident, unlike how he threw my hat in the mailbox on purpose, he literally jumped over the table and started throwing punches at me, after I had called him out and said what he did was deliberate, while I made a mistake and was sorry. Basically, he was royally pissed that I called him out for attacking me for an honest mistake, whereas I didn't do anything to him when he threw my hat in the mailbox.


I honestly had had enough, and I finally got the courage to defend myself as I figured since I was going to get in trouble anyways, why not, I snatched the textbook out of his hand as he was trying to hit me with it, and I nearly hit him over the head before Mrs. Magno broke the two of us up. while I didn't lay a finger on him, I knew I was going to have detention as whenever I was attacked, the bullies never got in trouble, I always did. I had accused her numerous times during that school year of discriminating against me for being autistic. She always made the excuse that I started the fights, when she clearly saw everything that happened, as her desk was in a small room and faced us at all times as we were less than ten feet away from her. 

I asked her, you saw what happened, right? She said yes, I asked her who started the fight, she said he did. I said, thank you, finally you admit the truth, as I was relieved, but angry that it took her so fucking long to realize I have been the victim here this whole time. 

I then proceeded to put on my jacket, but just as I was proceeding to step out of the door, she told me I couldn't go to recess outdoors as I am worried you will run into him. I said, but he went to class with his para. She said I understand, but I don't want to risk it. I was only allowed to go to recess with my classmates if recess was outdoors, if recess was indoors, I had to be in the inclusion office, often getting picked on and bullied.


The one thing, the only thing I had to look forward to was that I could use the computer, at Her Majesty's pleasure of course, as she often took away my computer privileges for any infraction real or imagined, big or small. Getting attacked was an automatic suspension of computer privileges for either that day, or the next day depending on when the incident happened. 

I had asked Mrs. Magno if I was in trouble, and she told me I was not, and I said, how so, you usually punish me for getting bullied. 

After putting my jacket back to the coat rack, I proceeded to go on the computer, as she had just told me I was not in trouble. I was literally thinking in my head, ""Finally the dumb bitch sees the truth."" 

But my satisfaction, albeit tiny was wiped away in an instant and replaced by absolute rage, for in one moment she told I couldn't go on the computer. 

I said, But you told me I wasn't in trouble. 

She said, I thought about it and this was your fault, you touched his jacket, causing this fight. I told her it was an accident, and I even pointed out how our jackets are completely identical to one another right down to the letter. 

She told me that she doesn't care and that if I continue arguing with her I will lose computer and recess privileges for tomorrow as well.


I then pointed how on Thursday he snatched my hat from my head and threw it in the mailbox and despite numerous witnesses including my para corroborating what I said he got absolutely no consequences at all, and that was a deliberate action, whereas mine was completely accidental. I told her, so you are punishing me for accidentally mistaking his jacket for mine when they look completely identical, yet you let Allen completely get  away with deliberatelt stealing my hat and throwing it in the mailbox on a 25 degree day. I was right you are discriminating agasinst me because you hate me for being different due to being autistic. 

She said, that's it you have lost the computer for tomorrow too, 

I told her, ""**** you, you f******* fata** r ."" 

This was the first time I had ever raised my voice and cussed at her at all, despite her having treated me like utter shit for months, the furthest I would go is talk back and rightfully accuse her of autism discrimination, but I was done playing nice, and all the hatred that has been accumulating in me for over six months came out in a torrent of rage. 

I further said to her, ""You Don't belong working with kids with special needs, you belong working at Rikers Island, as that's what you deserve for how you treat me for being autistic. I was 13 at the time so my vocabulary was pretty limited. 

She said ""That's it you lost computer privileges for the whole week, and if you keep going at it, you will lose it for all of next week as well. 

That was the final straw, the bully getting away for stealing my hat and discarding it and getting away with it and me essentially receiving his punishment for him attacking me was the final fucking straw. 

I got up from my seat and despite numerous warnings from her to sit down. I ignored her and went to the coat rack. I picked up the asshat's coat, threw it on the ground, stomped on it, dragged it across the floor with my boot, and kicked it a few times, ignoring her warnings and threats that I have lost computer privileges for next week as well for my act of revenge.

While I was dragging his jacket across the floor, I said, ""This for always getting me in trouble for the shit that you do, this for stealing my hat and throwing it in the mailbox, this is for attacking me and me getting your punishment for you attacking me, and this for all the future times I will get in trouble for your shit."" 

I then spit on his jacket and tried to tear it, but I was afraid of what he might do if he found his jacket damaged in any way, so I dusted his jacket off, wiped off the saliva, and put it back exactly where I found it, and exactly how it was placed. Feeling I have gotten even with him I left for my classes feeling content and satisfied. When my Para, who was amazing by the way came to walk with me to class. 

I had went to class, and about two and a half hours later it was time for dismissal. During dismissal, I got my jacket and put it on, and just as I was about to take my first step onto the steps, I felt a hard push and I tumbled down the stairs, and I landed hard. I was pretty badly hurt and I was sore all over, especially my lower back which took the brunt of the fall. It took me several minutes to get up, and I immediately who had pushed me as my Para Miss. Baccii called out the Bully's name Allen. (The reason I am naming my Para is because she was so amazing and I pray she finds this post and hope she can realize how she always lit up my day whenever she was there with her kindness, besides her, I had no friends at all and my only other friend was my science teacher who ended up becoming a dean in the middle school.)


Also Mrs. Magno came out and with a smug look on her face she said with a disgusting smugness and smile that made me have the urge to kock all her teeth out said overly smugly, ""Looks like someone told him what you did to his jacket."" 

When I declared my intention to tell the principal what happened she said if you do, you will get in more trouble and I will make sure of it.

She obviously didn't want her career to be over, so she also threw another student under the bus, who's na,e I forgot as he never picked on me and was very quiet and reserved and I considered him a ""friend"" simply because 1. he never picked on me. 2. we would occasionally engage in small talk. Now, looking back I  realize he wasn't a friend, just another person, but one who was kind. 

So when Mrs. Magno threw him under the bus, I asked him, did you tell Allen, he denied it completely, and I could immediately tell he was telling the truth, and I accused Mrs. Magno of telling him, mainly because of how smug she was about it all. 

She obviously denied the whole thing, all with smugness and a triumphant look on her face. 

Mrs, Magno promised me that Allen will be facing consequences mainly to appease me so I wouldn't go to the principal. Not believing what she said, as I knew and suspected her of telling me what I wanted to hear, I went to the SRO and told him everything that happened so he would tell the principal and so somethinh would be done about this grave injustice.


Because of the perpetual bullying and domestic abuse I experienced plus having no friends at all I was not only contemplating unaliving myself, but also doing magic/witchcraft. I began to convince myself since early October 2004 that I was cursed was the reason so many bad things were happening to me. 

I suspected the reason I was experiencing so many bad things, one after another was that due to the curse, I was experiencing something called ""reverse karma.""  

 I believed in trying to logically, as best as my traumatized13-year-old  mind could come up with the idea that with reverse karma when someone does something bad to me, I am so unlucky that the karma that is due to them, would fall on me instead, leading to two bad instances, and no justice of any kind. It explained everything so well, it explained why I had no friends, a dysfunctional family that treated me like shit, worse than an unwanted pet. 

Also, despite the name ""reverse"" it only applied for bad things happening to me. For instance, I decided to test out my theory by doing good deeds, and I told myself trying to convince my 13 year old self that I didn;t have reverse karma that if I do XYZ good deeds, this and this and this will happen, and if I truly do have reverse karma, I will have a terrrible day and to top it all off I predicted that at the end of the day, my toxic uncle will kick me out of the apartment for no reason at all, even though he had never done that before, even though he was toxic and abusive.

I tested the theory one October day on 2004 by buying food and coffee for the para and the director of the inclusion program, and despite not doing anything bad, as predicted I was bullied much worse than prior days and because of the bullying I lost my computer privilege despite having done nothing wrong, and when I got home I was very anxious as everything I had predicted came  true, and so I was expecting that my uncle was going to go off one me and kick me out for no reason at all. So I did everything to avoid upsetting him. I made sure the living room was spotlessly clean, the TV was off as he asked it be when he arrived from work before he went to bed, the night before. He warned me that if the TV is on and too loud he will send me to the bedroom, even though I needed the living room to do my homework as it was the only table in the whole house. The bedroom did not have a big enough table or desk, unfortunately. 

I predicted throughout the day that when he comes home he wouldn't have me go to the bedroom, he will completely kick me out for the night, even if I do nothing wrong and do everything perfectly because ""I'm the unluckiest person in the world."" I told myself. 

he came home, and I was literally walking on eggshells making sure I am not doing anything to set him off. But in truth I was secretly hoping he did, as I wanted to go off. 

And to my astonishments, after merely asking how his day was, he told me good. I then only got a couple words in trying to tell him about my day before I heard him shout, ""Get the fuck out of the apartment."" 

I initially thought my mind was playing tricks on me as I had imagined this very scenario so many times in my head that I thought that I must be hearing things in my mind. So I asked him to repeat what he said, and this time with an even louder and even more belligerent essentially shouting at the top of his lungs said, ""Get the fuck out before I will beat your ass."" 

I argued that I wasn't making any noise and just doing my homework, he said, in Russian, ""Pashol von atsuda paka ya teba ne espizdil. Which translates into Get out before I will fuck you up.""


Upon realizing this was really happening, I went into full meltdown and had the worst meltdown I had up to that part of my life, as all the pent-up rage that was building in anticipation of that very outcome and the terrible day I had in school despite all the good deeds, I did exploded like a thermonuclear bomb. 

Because I was so badly expecting this to happen I told my grandparents and my day hab worker of what I expected to happen because of the reverse karma I have. I expected that because of reverse karma, which I already concluded that I have, and based on the number of injstices that I went through because of the good deeds that I did means that when I get home things will surely be bad, so I imagined the worse case scenario where my shitty uncle will kick me out of the house for no reason at all in order for the mental preparation/anticipation. 

During my meltdown, I concluded that my grandma who has a reputation for being a snitch must have told my uncle, especially since I overheard her over the phone.    

I asked if she told him. She obviously denied it, but I concluded that she told him, and that he was doing it out of spite for my pessimistic prediction in which I vilified him, not that he didn't deserve it, he 100% did because that shitbird always treated me like shit including making fun of and imitating my stimms while laughing at me all the time.


I completely lost control of my emotions and started screaming and yelling and cussing her out, and I started for  the first time in my life I started deliberately damaging things in order to ""make things even"" As since I was being kicked out the house for no reason, I was going to do my damndest to make sure there was a fucking reason for me to be kicked out. If I was going to be treated like shit for no reason, I was going to give them a fucking reason to treat me like shit. I was basically you mess with the bull you get the horns. 

I was always a pushover up to that part of my life only verbally standing up for myself and having tiny meltdowns here and there, but this was the first time I had such a major one, considering how horribly I was treated by everyone that day, I'd say it was pretty proportional. 

Long sotry short I went to my now late Great Grandmother's apartment which thankfully was in the next building and I didn't even have to go outside as they were all interconnected through the basement, as the two apartment buildings had adjoining walls throughout the structure.  

Long story short, I began to do OCD rituals around April/May. 

At that time for two years I lived with my grandparents and uncle after a really bad altercation in August 2004 with my even more abusive stepfather caused my mom to have me live with her parents and her deadbeat brother for my safety, though it wasn't much better thanks to my uncle, but my uncle while an abusive prick, was not as abusive as my stepfather. At the time From August 2004 through April of 2005 I slept in the living room on a pretty uncomfortable foldable mattress sofa bed.


I made a slew of pessimistic predictions for 2004-2005, and all came true through April 2005. Incluiding that the annual road trip to florida (Not Disney or any other resort we're not that rich lol) with my grandparents was going to be canceled, and sure enough it was. That was the final catastrophic prediction that came true. That was the absolute final straw, and I had one option left at my disposal, as insane as it was magic, something I had never believed in at all up to that time, being a person of science and logic.

But I was like Why not. 

I started random rituals, such as flipping on and off the light a certain amount of times, walking a certain way, cracking my bones a certain way, how I walked, how I breathed, everything had to be perfect according to how I perceived them in terms of rituals. Initially I was doing my rituals in secret. 

And within a month, my family went to Florida in May, completely taking me by surprise, and by August for my birthday, my dad had bought me a PS2, and a TV, and my stepdad, someone who had always treated me worse than a homeless dog, gave me his hand-me-down computer as my uncle moved to Atlanta and I got to inhabit his bedroom. 

My life went from completely zero to 100 in less than three months, and I was sure my rituals were the reason. I finally for the first time in a very long time had hope. However by September, my family had discovered my rituals, and I was secretly hoping that since my mom is very superstitious she would support me as I tried to convince them that these rituals are keeping all the negative energy at bay that usually swirls around me and them.


Because of their discovery, I was forced to reduce the amount of rituals, and sure enough, things began to spiral downhill again. My mom was already planning on sending me to the Boston Higashi school, a school I wanted to go to simply because the school was Japanese-themed and because it was located in Boston I knew they would get more snow, and still to this day I am a snow lover. 

However, I told my mom why not just send me to another middle school a few blocks away, different teachers, probably better too, but she was adamant about sending me there. 

The next school year was much worse overall, while I didn't sustain a painful fall like I did the Para I had next year was far, far worse, and he was even worse than Mrs. Magno. He often got physical with me, pushing and shoving me, and because of a simple misunderstanding, he asked me to come out of the inclusion office after I called a student who falsely accused me of something he actually did considering I caught him doing it, and because I was once again punished, I said fuck you you motherfucker troublemaker.

Once out of the office, he grabbed me by the collar and forcibly dragged me into the stairwell. I thought he was going to throw me down the stairs. 

He pushed me hard against wall, and he said, I heard what you said, tell me what you said, and I told him exactly what I said, and he said no, you said ""Motherfucker troll nword. I was like what?! I never said that.

He said yes you did, and then he said we'll see. So he and I walked back to the inclusion office, and he said did deadname call you Motherfucker troll n word?"" I rolled my eyes at him realizing he was deliberately trying to get me in trouble by coaching him to say yes. Instead of asking, what did deadname say to you. He asked if I called him that name. A deliberate attempt to get me in trouble and having had bullied me for over a year at this point I had 100 percent expected him to falsely accuse me and to that he did. 

I went apeshit on him. ""You fucking knew if you named what you accused me of saying he is gonig to say yes, because (name redacted) Is a fucking piece of shit who always picks on and bullies me and you fucking know that. You know why you are accusing me of something like this and taking their side, because like you, they're black and I'm Jewish. You are a fucking racist piece of shit. And if you ever put your hands on me again, you will fucking regret it, do I make myself clear?"" 

He started shouting saying how dare I insinuate that he is playing favorites because they are the same race. I literally started laughing at him saying I know you are playing dumb. 

Also speaking of white privilege, I basically have none as I don‚Äôt pass for Caucasian as I pass for Middle Eastern and after 911, even though I‚Äôm Jewish, my classmates often bullied me because of my appearance, calling me, Osama bin Laden‚Äôs nephew. The bullying are pretty bad, especially after an incident that happened in 2002 when I was an elementary school, which triggered my first round of non magical thinking OCD, which lasted from 2002 through early 2003, in which I had nonstop intrusive thoughts I still do this day consider this the worst OCD I‚Äôve ever had with the exception of my rituals that I developed a year and a half later because of the bullying. This OCD was from acute trauma, the magical thinking OCD was because of prolonged trauma

Two months later around my OCD which was really my undiagnosed trauma response got so bad my family had to pull me out of school and I had to get homeschooled the the remaining spring into the summer of 2006.

In September 2006, only six months later I was sent to the Boston Higashi School, where I stayed until August of 2012. 

When I came home for vacation despite having been allowed to play video games at the school during leisure time from 9PM to 10PM I was not allowed to play video games at all, with my mom claiming it is because autistic people are addicted to video games. Because the word ableism/ableist was not in my vocabulary yet, I told my mom, You are discriminating against me for being autistic. This is proof that you hate me for being autistic and that you want to make my life miserable while I am here.

She said see this is proof that you are addicted. You are so addicted to video games that because I told you no you are arguing with me and falsely accusing me of discriminating against you for being autistic. 

I said because you mentioned my diagnosis as the reason. You are full of shit. 

Long story short, because of my well justified ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù towards my mom, by talking back and saying she was full of shit, my PS2 was confiscated for the entire summer I was home, which was over two months. I was also not allowed to play my sisters' video games, even with them. I was essentially grounded for being an outspoken disabled self-advocate. 

Based on this I told the school the concern of the placement I would be in when I graduate, even though dismissal was still several years away at this point.

I was extremely worried about what was going to happen when I got dismissed to live back with my parents. The anxiety was so bad that I had to go to therapy twice a week instead of the usual once per week during the last school year of how apprehensive and catastrophic I was about being released back to my parents. 

I was basically expecting them to treat me like a slave, take away all of my rights and completely stripped me of all of my privileges and that I was gonna end up in the most controlling environment possible which at the time was a group home with 24 hours supervision for extremely disabled individuals. 

When the Director of transition during my transition meeting told me the likely outcome that I was going to be placed in as I was being discharged out of the school when he was meeting with me I told him that was not going to happen that my parents would never allow that. 

Instead of saying, the usual, I swear to God because I‚Äôm so motherfucking unlucky‚Äù logically explain to Director of adult transitioning, whose job was to make sure that people who were leaving the school were placed in a safe environment told me that the most likely outcome ended. Most desired outcome was a place for individuals like myself, who have low needs, and have aspergers now called HFA, or LNA (Low need Autism) 

I pleaded that my parents are very discriminatory towards me and treat me very poorly when I‚Äôm home and I explained to him that because of this I believe that I‚Äôll be placing the most controlling environment possible. I went onto to explain how I was not allowed to leave the house under any circumstances when no one was home I was not given the spare keys, allowed to play video games this happens every time I go on vacation during the winter spring or summer. 

He told me that I need to look on the bright side of things and that always catastrophize. I told him that I‚Äôm not catastrophize that I‚Äôm coming up with the most logical conclusion that the way my parents are treating me that they do not love me and only see me as a tool to control. 

I argued that I was likely going to end up in a very controlling environment most likely a group home with 24 hour supervision or even an apartment by myself with 24 hours supervision though I didn‚Äôt know at the time it was called the 24 hour IRA (independent residential apartment) I was simply just imagining the worst case scenarios the worst of the worst as bad as prison, but not prison. 

I imagine that after several months of living at my parents house, I was going to be taken to an environment that was even more controlling than the Boston Higashi school residence, as there I was allowed to play video games between one hour and one hour 30 minutes during the weekdays and two hours during the weekends, and I expected that when I was gonna be playing for approximately zero hours and zero minutes and zero seconds during the weekday and weekend when I‚Äôm gonna be living with my mom and stepfather after transitioning out before I get placed in supportive or what I suspected was going to be supervised housing. 

And I also said that when I get placed in the supervised housing, I was also not gonna be allowed to play video games there too per orders of my family. 

The direct transition said that I was going completely overboard and way out of left field, but I reminded him that my predictions are always accurate and have yet to be wrong. 

At the time, I didn‚Äôt know that the highest level of supervision was a 24 hour independent residential apartment, but I told her Director of transition that I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I get placed in something even more controlling than a regular group home, highest level of control possible, despite me being high functioning. 

This wasn‚Äôt the day of the meeting with my parents, this is when I sat one on one with the Director of transition and he told me discharge plan.

Please ensure you know how to remain anonymous when upvoting or commenting here. This message is for honest wage earners who show up to do good work and earn a decent living.

There is no point in using Tell Tony or Tell Nadia workplace groups. Any opinions shared there with genuine intentions of improving the company only lead to consequences. In reality, these platforms are a facade, and no one truly cares about us. Many of us have dedicated years here, staying loyal through COVID-19, for which we are grateful to AirAsia for providing employment. However, we‚Äôre now backed into a corner by a leadership team with little understanding of the commitment we put in daily ‚Äì nights, weekends ‚Äì because we believed in a brand we thought stood for something meaningful.

This leadership only seems to care about its own standing rather than the company's performance. We understand that AirAsia MOVE is a business, and profit is essential. But the decisions being made and the culture being fostered are so toxic that we don‚Äôt need competitors to take us down ‚Äì this trio of leaders is doing that on their own.

This post is to bring attention to the CEO (Nadia), Chief People Officer (Benjie), and Chief Product Officer (Nikunj) ‚Äì a ""Bermuda Triangle"" of leadership where any hope of supportive management disappears.

**Nadia**

You‚Äôve systematically removed anyone with a differing opinion. Rather than embracing ideas to benefit the company, you eliminate those who challenge you. Su Lin, Daphne, Ma Yin, Dabraj, Shyam, Naveen, and Gerald, just to name a few, were honest, hardworking employees, pushed out simply for differing views.

Business numbers are declining, yet instead of addressing this, Tony is focused elsewhere, and you‚Äôre not taking responsibility. If you‚Äôre struggling, ask for help ‚Äì there are people here who want you to succeed and can contribute, but we're silenced because of the dictatorial approach you enforce.

We don‚Äôt want your job or your paycheck. All you do is micromanage and make life difficult for those keeping the lights on. Stop saying, ‚ÄúTell me what support you need‚Äù when you don‚Äôt mean it. When we try to share our challenges, you simply fire us.

Your ""Coffee Connects"" and workplace PR stunts are all just for show. You don‚Äôt care about us. You fly back to Bangkok every Thursday and return on Monday or Tuesday. The one Friday you actually show up, you comment on low office attendance, implying we‚Äôre not working. Instead of criticizing, focus on real business goals rather than berating employees who have received no raises or bonuses for years.

**Benjie**

What are your credentials as Chief People Officer? Instead of advocating for us, you act as a CCTV, reporting back to leadership. The attrition rate here is through the roof, yet instead of benchmarking compensation or defining job bands and skills matrices, you‚Äôre living an elite C-suite lifestyle, jet-setting to conferences and building your personal brand. Hopefully, this post raises your profile even more.

There‚Äôs no investment in learning and development. We're overworked and not given opportunities to grow. It‚Äôs not always about money ‚Äì often, it‚Äôs how we're treated. Meanwhile, we constantly hear Nikunj calling us ""fucking idiots.""

**Nikunj**

If you're so brilliant, perhaps you belong at NASA, considering that the rest of us are ""idiots"" in your eyes. You never say, ""Let's fix this together"" or ""Let's work together to find a solution."" Instead, we hear:

\- ‚ÄúYou guys are fucking idiots.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúWho the fuck asked you to do that?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúDid I ask you to do that?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem ‚Äì you fucking fix it.‚Äù

One day, we‚Äôll record this and post it for the world to hear. We don‚Äôt like you, Nikunj, and neither does anyone else. Do you contribute anything to the product roadmap that actually drives revenue?

**What‚Äôs Next**

This will likely be talked about for a few weeks, then forgotten. Nadia, Benjie, and Nikunj aim to make the company profitable by firing people. To other businesses out there: AirAsia MOVE has incredible talent. Come and hire us; let‚Äôs help MOVE reach profitability that way. We are good, honest, hard-working employees.

Tony will undoubtedly support Nadia, Nikunj, and Benjie, and they‚Äôll crucify us rather than do any real self reflection. These wealthy executives think we‚Äôre here only for their flight benefits, while they treat us poorly. If you see job applications from AirAsia MOVE employees, know that they‚Äôve had enough of the leadership here.

Nadia, Nikunj, and Benjie, this post will remain online as a warning: stay far from the Bermuda Triangle of leadership. Karma has a way of catching up in this lifetime. We wish you success in ‚Äúcleaning house.‚Äù

This is not a cohesive storyline, but rather scenes that I made up in my head.


---------


Scene: Liberator flight deck. The crew are all assembled there.

Avon: Aquatar is the material that makes up our teleport, medical, replication and auto-repair systems.

Blake: If Dorian wants Aquatar, then he's planning on building or repairing his own systems. His ship must be advanced like the Liberator.

Avon: (Angry and looking at Jenna) How the HELL did Dorian know about this?

(Jenna crosses her arms)

Jenna: I have no idea. He's had the same ship for decades. It doesn't look anything like the Liberator. I've been on board his ship, it looks like a normal ship a smuggler might use. I was a co-pilot on the Scorpio a few years back.

Cally: I think I know what alerted him. I was able to detect an emotional reaction when he scanned the gold.

Vila: By the way, where is the gold?

Blake (ignoring Vila): What do you mean Cally?

Avon: I think Cally is right. It's when he scanned the gold. He may have discovered that it was replicated.

Jenna: But it's real isn't it? Pure gold? It's not fake.

Avon: No it's not fake. But I think his scanner was able to examine the array of atoms that made up the gold. Gold formed naturally in ore and then refined is heterogenous in its makeup. What we presented to him was gold created in a simple pattern, homogenous.

Vila: Homo what?

Blake: (ignoring Vila) Which means that Dorian can not only discover that the gold has been replicated, but that we have the technology to replicate.

Avon: (nodding) He must have his own advanced systems on his ship.

Cally: So what now?

(pause)

Jenna: We still need those star charts.

Blake: And Dorian is the only one we can get them from?

Jenna: There's plenty of smugglers out there with their own charts. It's just that Dorian has far more than anyone else I know. 

Blake: Avon?

Avon: You know my opinion. We shouldn't be on this crazy crusade of yours.

Blake: What of that mutoid?

Jenna: Dorian said that she was a ""former"" mutoid, and that she had had a procedure.

Blake: Quite possible. But what did you detect Cally?

Cally: She has some level of enhancement. Mutoids are almost always have dulled emotions and senses. But that mutoid's focus was very sharp. I wouldn't want to get in a gun fight with her.

----------------------------

Scene: Dorian's private room on the Scorpio. Dorian is sitting in his chair, thinking. There is a buzz at the door.

Dorian: Come in.

(Dayna comes in)

Dayna (looking annoyed) What do you want Dorian?

(Dorian looks at her with an expressionless face)

Dorian: Four romeo romeo yankee six kilo mike two whiskey romeo

Dayna (shrugs): I still don't want to be in here.

Dorian: Jenna's ship is of Transhuman design. I was able to get a long distance scan of it.

(Dorian's screen shows a fuzzy Liberator shape)

Dayna: (suddenly frightened). Oh shit!

Dorian: What's wrong?

Dayna (agitated): I think that's a System ship.

Dorian: A what ship?

Dayna: A System ship. They're really bad. (insistant) Dorian we have to get out of here!

Dorian: We will. As soon as they give us some Aquatar.

Dayna: Aquatar? That again?

Dorian: There's a good chance that they have the ability to replicate things. I saw that when I was given the Scorpio. The teleport bay hasn't worked in decades. We can fix it!

Dayna: You were never told about the System were you? My people fight them. And we were once pacifists. The System were so bad that they forced pacifists into giving up pacifism to survive!

Dorian: I looked at them carefully, they didn't look like Transhumans. Jenna and the Auron woman were ordinary humans.

Dayna: (disbelieving) And you're suddenly able to tell the difference?

Dorian: Well I've got you here haven't I?

Dayna: Okay look. If you want me to keep functioning and not run off in terror you're going to have to lock me again, otherwise I'll end up telling Tarrant and Soo.

Dorian: Okay then. Four romeo romeo yankee six kilo mike two whiskey romeo.

Dayna: Finally. All right. So what do we do then?

Dorian: Well we...

Dayna: No. Tell you what just send me some textmail. I can't handle this place any more. 

(Dayna leaves)

----------------------------

Scene: The Teleport room. Avon and Blake are at the controls.

(Tarrant, Dorian and Gan are teleported in)

(Tarrant is amazed at being teleported)

Tarrant: Well fuck me.

(Dorian looks over at Blake and Avon)

Dorian: (raises eyebrows) You're Blake.

Blake: I am.

Dorian (looks around): And this is the alien ship.

(Tarrant looks at Blake)

Tarrant: Wait, you're Blake.

(Blake says nothing but looks at Tarrant silently)

Avon (to Dorian): And this is your excuse for a pilot?

Tarrant: Oh fuck you.

Blake: You got the Aquatar?

Dorian: Yes. Thank you. Gan was very helpful.

Blake: You have the charts?

(Tarrant holds out a small memstik)

Tarrant: Right here.

Blake: Gan, please escort Tarrant to the flight deck. Jenna's waiting.

Gan: Righty-o.

(Gan and Tarrant, but not without Tarrant giving Avon the eye)

(Blake gets up and goes over to Dorian and holds his hand out. They both shake)

Dorian: Well if I'd known it was Blake I was dealing with, I may have changed my terms.

Blake: How much? Up or down?

Dorian: Well I'll leave that for you to stew over. And you (looks at Avon). You're the hacker who stole all that money from the Federation.

(Avon says nothing)

Dorian: And so where's this Orac that Servelan was talking about?

Avon: (sarcastically) We'll leave that for you to stew over.

----------------------------

(Gan and Tarrant enter the flight deck. Jenna is there waiting. Jenna and Tarrant sort of recognise each other.)

Tarrant: (points) Wait. I know you from somewhere.

Jenna: Me too. Was it Federation flight school on Hellyer?

Tarrant: Yes it was. Hell yeah it was. Tarrant.

Jenna: Jenna. I remember now. I was a junior instructer there for a term. Six years ago. You were a boisterous young flyer.

(Tarrant has walked over to Jenna's position on the flight deck)

Tarrant: I was. I ended up joining the Federation Navy, flew pursuit ships. Went AWOL. Remained AWOL. Associated with some low lifes and became a smuggler. Here are the charts (hands Jenna the memstik).

Jenna: Thank you.

Tarrant: So what happened to you?

Jenna: Smuggler too. You've probably heard Dorian's story of how he met me. After my 3 weeks on the Scorpio I spent some time with some Federation rebels but that ended up falling apart.

Tarrant: How so?

Jenna: (rolls eyes) So much politics. I ended up smuggling weapons in for a cell on Wynyard, and they used them to kill a rival group rather than Federation goons. After that I got out of Federation space and worked legitimate routes on Halix. And then one day the Federation invaded and I was back in the rebel camp. That lasted as long as the previous one, so I decided who cares and I began ilicit smuggling between Scopus and Meander.

Tarrant: What cargo?

Jenna: Mainly cats from Scopus and coffee beans from Meander. Don't ask. (they laugh) And then one day I traveled to Earth for a holiday, and the Federation picked me up. I was convicted of all sorts of things I was guilty of, and was on my way to Cygnus Alpha... and the rest is confidential.

Tarrant: So you're not going to tell me the story of how you ended up on this ship?

Jenna: No. Instead I'm going to download the charts.

(Short silence as Jenna begins downloading)

Tarrant: So who's the prick with Blake?

Jenna: Well there's only one prick on board and that would be Avon. We'd kill him but he's too useful. (pause) Wait, what's this file?

(Jenna is looking at a DOS-type file manager screen.)

Tarrant: Ah, yes. That's the encrypted Federation military chart file.

Jenna: You were able to get a copy of that? That's a level 9 crime. 

Tarrant: Well, it's a few years old now from my Pursuit ship days. I've been told it's worth something even though you can't decrypt it.

Jenna: Let's just see if the program recognises it. And here we are. Zen, please display the highlighted starchart.

Zen: Confirmed.

(a chart is displayed on the front monitor)

Tarrant: Wait. I can read that!

Jenna: (exicted) Whatever decryption was used it seems the Liberator is able to see. We have all the top-secret Federation charts! Look. Thousands of uncharted dwarfs and gas giants. Dozens of alternative routes between star systems, both inside and outside Federation space! This extends out even beyond the red line.

Tarrant: Can you save that back to my memstick in unencrypted form?

Jenna: Let's see. Yep. Done. Here.

(Jenna hands memstick back to Tarrant).

(They are both smiling)

Tarrant: I think we should tell our bosses.

----------------------------

Notes:

* Starcharts show lanes between star systems and consist of various waypoints. While space is big and empty, there is enough detritus in between to make faster-then-light travel difficult. You don't want your ship to collide with an asteroid. Mapping the entirety of space is impossible, so ""open source"" mapping of routes is required, showing not only the location of drifting objects, but also how their position changes as they move. So a star map is not static, but contains information about all the moving objects that might damage a FTL ship. The Federation military has its own secret maps. Navigating between star systems is more difficult the more ""stuff"" there is in between, so a good map results in faster travel. Taking your ship blindly into an unmapped area is very dangerous.

* The ""Red Line"" is the limit at which human colonies are known to exist. It's more a red sphere. It's understood that beyond the Red Line, many human colonies exist, but not ones that are big enough to be considered economically useful. These are planets which have less than 100,000 people. Remember that in this universe, all stars have one inhabitable 1G planet.

* A ""Level 9 Crime"" is punishable by death.

* Aquatar is mentioned in the original B7 series as a substance that is essential in teleportation technology. Both Blake and Avon worked for a Federation Aquatar project.

* Dayna is secretly transhuman. She is a former builder spy. Dorian knows this and uses a password to communicate to her full self, which she has decided to keep hidden from others.

* A memstick is basically a USB stick in the B7 universe.

* If you haven't worked out already, Dorian has an emotional effect on those around him. People around him get angrier and annoyed with him over time, which requires him to return to Xenon base and go to the basement. Then he is refreshed and everybody loves him again. This cycle continues. It's also obvious that those around him know about this effect, and know what happens in the basement. I've decided not to go the original B7 Dorian route where he has to kill people to give him more life.",1,1729933506.0,Blakes7,0,1.0,False

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and he caught covid. Distinct cognitive decline since then, very little talk, lots of sleeping and less eating and drinking (including no coffee which is unheard of)!

He is someone is worked with over a year ago. We got along very well, I always had a thing for him honestly. He initiated hugs multiple times and I always felt like he liked me (maybe not romantically). But there was some type of chemistry there. At least for me. After I left the job, once in a while he texted to ask how I‚Äôm doing at uni etc. 
But I never really initiated anything myself, I felt too shy. Half a year ago he suddenly called me at my new workplace, and we talked. 
He then ended the phone call by saying I should call him back then and then.
I didn‚Äôt do that, because, again, i felt too shy.
A few days ago, it‚Äôs been half year since the phone call, a texted him and asked him ""hey, I know this seems random, but I just wanted to ask you if you would like to meet for coffee. If so, let me know""

This post is to bring attention to the CEO (Nadia), Chief People Officer (Benjie), and Chief Product Officer (Nikunj) ‚Äì a ""Bermuda Triangle"" of leadership where any hope of supportive management disappears.

**Nadia**

You‚Äôve systematically removed anyone with a differing opinion. Rather than embracing ideas to benefit the company, you eliminate those who challenge you. Su Lin, Daphne, Ma Yin, Dabraj, Shyam, Naveen, and Gerald, just to name a few, were honest, hardworking employees, pushed out simply for differing views.

Business numbers are declining, yet instead of addressing this, Tony is focused elsewhere, and you‚Äôre not taking responsibility. If you‚Äôre struggling, ask for help ‚Äì there are people here who want you to succeed and can contribute, but we're silenced because of the dictatorial approach you enforce. 

We don‚Äôt want your job or your paycheck. All you do is micromanage and make life difficult for those keeping the lights on. Stop saying, ‚ÄúTell me what support you need‚Äù when you don‚Äôt mean it. When we try to share our challenges, you simply fire us.

Your ""Coffee Connects"" and workplace PR stunts are all just for show. You don‚Äôt care about us. You fly back to Bangkok every Thursday and return on Monday or Tuesday. The one Friday you actually show up, you comment on low office attendance, implying we‚Äôre not working. Instead of criticizing, focus on real business goals rather than berating employees who have received no raises or bonuses for years.

**Benjie**

What are your credentials as Chief People Officer? Instead of advocating for us, you act as a CCTV, reporting back to leadership. The attrition rate here is through the roof, yet instead of benchmarking compensation or defining job bands and skills matrices, you‚Äôre living an elite C-suite lifestyle, jet-setting to conferences and building your personal brand. Hopefully, this post raises your profile even more.

There‚Äôs no investment in learning and development. We're overworked and not given opportunities to grow. It‚Äôs not always about money ‚Äì often, it‚Äôs how we're treated. Meanwhile, we constantly hear Nikunj calling us ""fucking idiots.""

**Nikunj**

If you're so brilliant, perhaps you belong at NASA, considering that the rest of us are ""idiots"" in your eyes. You never say, ""Let's fix this together"" or ""Let's work together to find a solution."" Instead, we hear:

\- ‚ÄúYou guys are fucking idiots.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúWho the fuck asked you to do that?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúDid I ask you to do that?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem ‚Äì you fucking fix it.‚Äù

One day, we‚Äôll record this and post it for the world to hear. We don‚Äôt like you, Nikunj, and neither does anyone else. Do you contribute anything to the product roadmap that actually drives revenue?

**What‚Äôs Next**

This will likely be talked about for a few weeks, then forgotten. Nadia, Benjie, and Nikunj aim to make the company profitable by firing people. To other businesses out there: AirAsia MOVE has incredible talent. Come and hire us; let‚Äôs help MOVE reach profitability that way. We are good, honest, hard-working employees.

Tony will undoubtedly support Nadia, Nikunj, and Benjie, and they‚Äôll crucify us rather than do any real introspection. These wealthy executives think we‚Äôre here only for their flight benefits, while they treat us poorly. If you see job applications from AirAsia MOVE employees, know that they‚Äôve had enough of the leadership here.

Nadia, Nikunj, and Benjie, this post will remain online as a warning: stay far from the Bermuda Triangle of leadership. Karma has a way of catching up in this lifetime. We wish you success in ‚Äúcleaning house.‚Äù

1gcgs1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheffield/comments/1gcgs1r/where_to_book_a_room_for_a_small_group_social/,Where to book a room for a small group social?,"Hello people of Sheffield,

I am looking to host a private small group event with some of my friends which will be a cake competition. For context on the event, we will all bake cakes at home then meet up to sample and judge them and have a few drinks (tea/coffee or alcohol) - the venue could either be self-catered or purchasing drinks at a venue (but obviously it'd need to be comfortable with us bringing our own food). I expect it'll be around 10-20 people (probably on the lower end of this).

I'm looking for a venue to do this in late November. I was thinking it could be either in a private room in a pub/cafe but it could just be a private room somewhere like an office building/event space and we could self cater drinks.

My other criteria is that it is ideally cheap and reasonably central. I'd appreciate any thoughts or recommendations from the Sheffield community :)",4,1729932758.0,sheffield,6,0.83,False

Over 27k coffees :) However, now the machine has developed a fault.  Usually (but not always) the first coffee will not deliver into the cup but instead diverts the cup into the tray.  This also sometimes happens when I fill the water compartment - on the first cup it'll grind the beans and go through the motions, but no coffee into the cup.

I've taken the machine apart, can not see anything wrong with it, cleared out the various parts to make sure there's no limescale build up but the issue persists.  It's strange that it works most of the time but just not the first coffee!  Could it be an air lock? How do I find it? 

Thanks in advance

1gcgr60,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1gcgr60/fs_meeting_at_my_home_one_woman_and_4_men/,FS meeting at my home (one woman and 4 men),"Super weird. So my PIMO ase husband never opposed to his wife wanting to have the FS meeting at home. When I was PIMI my home was the center point, so it was logic to do the service meeting at home and we were happy about it.

We have only a few times at our home now.
This morning was funny, the group overseer was not here (he is at some ldc construction with his wife), but there was 4 men (2 of them are married and were without their wives, 1 is aged and his wife DA or POMO, and the last one single) and my wife. I was sitting in the sofa, pretending to follow the logical fallacy that was being told.

They all are nice people, we laughed a bit, drank coffee and bye bye to the field (I didn', like the past 6 month)

When my wife was leaving to the FS I said, with a funny tone :""I'm reassured you're safe, 4 men with you, I think they can protect you"".
She smiled, and rolled her eyes understanding the silliness.

It was funny

I tried all of recommended espresso grind settings and i still have this issue.

So basically whatever i do it sticks to the shower screen. (The sticking is not directly sticking to the shower screen, the puck is always wet when i remove the PF and some grounds on the shower screen) I put 16-18G finer ground it happens. So i done a bit coarser and put 15G it sticks again. Even if it doesnt really sticks puck is always wet.

And another important part is when the machine extract coffee, the sound of machine is decrasing time to time. (This only happens when i do with finer ground).

Otherwise the coffee tastes very good, not sour or different. But when i see that people dont have this issues with this machine in Youtube, i wonder and want to fix the issue. I hope I could explain it.

(Truthfully, I probably shouldn't have went out, as I wasn't mentally so good, but i thought it might help). We had a good night, and I don't drink myself so I was A LOT more drunk than they were. We went back to Jim's (real names are not used) and I believed myself to have been with people I trusted, and I was a drunken emotional wreck and I blurted a trauma (what I wasn't really in a good place about that day) that had never told anyone about. Carol, and Hannah went back home for me and Jim to talk, and that was all fine. However, Carol messaged asking him to come and help as there was someone following them home, so Jim walked me to a halfway point between where they were and my accommodation. When I got back, I was still very emotional, drunk, and vulnerable due to what i said, and not having been in such a state before, I was starting to envision what I could do with certain kitchen utensils (nothing happened, never had those kinds of thoughts before, I think it was just the state of which I was in). So therefore I asked Jim if it was okay for him to come back to me, as I needed someone, after he had helped Carol, and Hannah. He was unable to as they were very much shaken up, and I completely understood that. So I moved the utensils out of sight, and just drank water and let it pass. When the thoughts had calmed down, I was messaging them asking if they were all okay, at one point I said exactly ""genuinely worried, are you lot all okay, and safe"". I received a voice message from Carol basically apologising to me for like having Jim, and I replied to it ""no no, it's okay your safety is more important"". And after that I fell asleep. I woke up to a message from Carol saying that her and Hannah saw all the messages I sent Jim that night ""wtf"". At that point I looked back at the chat to see if maybe I did say something, or perhaps it wasn't clear that I requested him to come back after he had helped, but I looked at it and it was just how I've stated it above: could you help me after, are you lot okay, your safety is more important (paraphrasing as just stated before). So I messaged Carol back saying ""Idk, but I hate myself for not fully comprehending the seriousness of the situation [they] were in at first"", and I was distraught all day. When I finally calmed down, I sent an apology message acknowledging that I may have possibly caused some form of hurt, and asking if we could grab a coffee to talk in person about it. I haven't heard anything from them since.

I have spoken to the pastoral leader, explained the entire situation, in a lot more detail that I am not willing to put online (apologies), she said the apology message was well written, and I did everything correctly, and it is up to them. 

I have also spoken to a somewhat mutual friend (somewhat as she ain't close to Carol and Hannah at all, just on the same course, therefore knows them), and she said Carol does seem to have quite a large ego, and possibly is quite an attention seeker (which tbf, I can see that too, as she's always telling way too much, its all me me me with her), therefore they could be overreacting in order to have the attention on her.

I have even spoken to a lecturer about it and she said pretty much the same as both the pastoral leader and mutual friend. 

They have all told me to just give them time, and hopefully over the next week I might hear something to try and resolve it. I have also booked a wellbeing appointment (in relation to the trauma I had blurted out, and I am thinking that if I haven't heard anything from them, perhaps wellbeing could help, as we are on the same course, it's unlikely that we can just completely ignore each other) 

But rn, I really do still feel like absolute crap, coz Jim and I weren't dating, but we were close, and us four as a group... I have had a crap life up until I started uni (and that is an understatement), and I had honestly never seen myself that happy as I was with them. So I am really hoping whatever the reason they are not talking to me atm is, we can resolve it.

I 25(F) and him 30 (M) just had our first child in June of this year we were together 4.5 years. I had no idea he was super close to this girl from work 23 (F) they were meeting weekly for coffee on his day off while I worked. They would also go to late night events together while I tested at home pregnant and he would return very late at night. He said other friends also attended most of those but I don't fully believe that. This was happening for most of the pregnancy. He also said in hindsight I spent too much time with her. He split with me when our baby was 6weeks. When he split with me his reasons were : my personality, I became selfish in pregnancy (been told by other friends I'm one of the most selfless people they know), I would stress over very little and the pregnancy made me less attractive to him. He then told me we have told eachother we like eachother but I ""never actually cheated on you"". To him emotional cheating isn't real cheating. I now know 2 months since breakup he is already staying over at hers regularly he says they are still just ""friends"". I'm trying to be so nice to him as we now share a baby, i see him regularly as I am still in the process of moving out of our shared place with the baby and moving in with family (a process as I have to move cities because we were living away from home for his work).  She is BF only so any time he spends with her is only during the day and I awkwardly have to attend any meets with friends or family of his. He refuses to quit his job and move home to be an attentive dad to her instead will visit when he can probably every 3-6 months but I'll believe it when I see it.

I have to know did he also physically cheat on me? Thoughts? Was he lieing about concerts and staying late nights at her house earlier? I'm guessing with his moving on so quickly they were already at the basically dating stage and that's why he split with me when he did.

He is someone I worked with for a few months almost a year ago. We got along very well, I always had a thing for him honestly. He initiated hugs multiple times and I always felt like he liked me (maybe not romantically). But there was some type of chemistry there. At least for me. After I left the job, once in a while he texted to ask how I‚Äôm doing at uni etc. 
But I never really initiated anything myself, I felt too shy. Half a year ago he suddenly called me at my new workplace, and we talked. 
He then ended the phone call by saying I should call him back then and then.
I didn‚Äôt do that, because, again, i felt too shy.
A few days ago, it‚Äôs been half year since the phone call, a texted him and asked him ""hey, I know this seems random, but I just wanted to ask you if you would like to meet for coffee. If so, let me know""
To which he immediately replied with sure and asked for a time. So now we‚Äôre meeting each other very soon. 
I‚Äôm super nervous. 

How can this be more than just coffee? Does he maybe see it as more than just coffee?

The love of my life , 9 year old Cockapoo Chester has just been diagnosed with a grade 4 heart murmur and mild heart disease.

It's all happened very fast this week. I took him in on the Monday for his yearly boosters and the vet said she can hear a murmur. I freaked out started crying and she recommended a dog cardiologist at ¬£1000. So I spend the rest of the day selling everything of value and booked it for Wednesday. It was torture dropping him off and waiting I had a panic attack in the coffee shop waiting. 

The cardiologist rang me and said he has minor value leakage and a loud grade 4 heart murmur. He asked for full blood works to be done to test for anything else too. 

The bloods / blood pressure all came up perfect he's a healthy dog they have said other than the murmur and mild value issue and minor chamber enlargement. The cardiologist report just says 'minor' and they don't want to start him on any meds yet or anything.  

But I can't stop crying, I've not had any sleep since Monday. 

I feel guilty too as he's been doing 8 miles a day all his life (he's 9) and as recent as 3 weeks ago we had a holiday on the Isle of Skye and he did all the big hikes everyday. On the last day though he didn't want to go but I encouraged him up the hill anyway and I'm just feeling awful my baby was unwell and I didn't know it. 

I'm just so worried he's going to die. The vets have said to pull myself together and just slow the walks and not let him know I'm upset. Just let him decide the schedule now. 

Normally we would be out at 9am for a walk as  he gets up then and then licks me to get me up but now he wants a lie in a bit longer. Even just the space of this week. Has he wanted to slow down for longer and I've been encouraging him out and doing him more harm? He's so happy on walks it's what he loves most. But since we've found this news out it's like chilling out is what he wants to do. Don‚Äôt get me wrong when he's out he's pulling on lead and loving it but I'm letting him take me where we wants and that seems to just be on the estate as a walk now.  

I'm just so worried how can a grade 4 murmur just come out of nowhere. 

I guess it's just like people, why do some people die at 20 and others lead long lives to 100+. 

My heart is broken even though everyone (vets, cardiologist) seem to be not worried right at the moment. I asked the cardiologist on the phone ""is Chester dying"" and the cardiologist said ""not yet"" which I suppose is of course better than ""yes."" 

But hearing this news has changed everything. Nothing seems to matter anymore. I'm not interested in making money , buying things I normally like for the home etc. going out for a coffee etc. all that matters in my mind now is keeping Chester healthy. Money that would be spent of coffee, or clothes/food for me, or whatever I want now on making memories with my dog. 

Does anyone have any advice/ having similar experience please? 

I would do anything to make this dog happy.

1gcghy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mystery/comments/1gcghy4/where_did_my_neighbour_go/,Where did my neighbour go??,"I‚Äôve lived next to my neighbor, Linda, for about four months now, but in that short time, we‚Äôve developed a close bond. She‚Äôs in her late 50s and lives alone, with some chronic health issues that I know are tough on her. Over the months, she‚Äôs shared a lot with me about her life, her past, and her family struggles. We quickly became more like family than neighbors, so when she started leaning on me for little things, I was glad to help. A few weeks ago, I even took her to a medical procedure and served as her emergency contact, a role she entrusted to me because she often says she can‚Äôt rely on her family.

From what she‚Äôs told me, she only has sporadic contact with her daughter, and that relationship is strained. Linda‚Äôs lack of support makes me want to help even more. So, on October 31, we chatted on the phone, and she told me she had a doctor‚Äôs appointment the next morning for a knee injection. I know she gets anxious about these medical visits, so I offered to take her. She sounded relieved and accepted, saying she‚Äôd text me in the morning around 8:30 a.m. to confirm.

That same evening, she called again, sounding a little down. She asked if my husband and I wanted to join her for a drive, maybe hit a karaoke bar to lift her spirits. She didn‚Äôt go into detail, but I could tell she was upset about something. I felt bad, but I declined since we were in the middle of a movie. I promised her I‚Äôd be there for the doctor‚Äôs appointment, though, and she seemed reassured.

I got up early the next morning, expecting her text. Linda is usually outside by 7:30 a.m., watering her plants, so when I didn‚Äôt see her, I figured she might be sleeping in. But by 8:30, there was still no word from her. I texted and then called, but no response. I walked over to her house and rang the bell, thinking maybe she hadn‚Äôt heard her phone. No answer. By 11:30 a.m., I was worried enough to try again. I decided to check in with another neighbor who knows her. He tried calling too, but still nothing. Together, we walked over, but her car wasn‚Äôt in the driveway, which struck me as odd. She‚Äôs usually so attached to her routine.

When I peeked into her garage window, I saw her car was gone. The realization hit hard‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt come back home. Both the other neighbor and I decided to reach out to her family, hoping they‚Äôd know something. But when we finally reached them, they told us not to worry or involve the police yet. They insisted she‚Äôd show up on her own in a day or so, dismissing our concern as unnecessary. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off, especially since Linda always tells me how much she values her home as her safe space.

Two days passed, and Linda‚Äôs house remained dark and empty. It was unlike her. She‚Äôd never mentioned staying away from home overnight, and she had this doctor‚Äôs appointment she seemed anxious about, which made her absence even stranger. By the evening of the second day, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the sense that something was seriously wrong. I felt torn‚Äîwas I overreacting, or should I be doing more? Ignoring her family‚Äôs advice, I decided to call the non-emergency line to request a welfare check. I just wanted to know she was okay.

The officers arrived that evening, and I explained the situation. They took my concerns seriously and went over to her house. After a few minutes, one of them called me back with an update that left me confused and relieved at the same time. Linda had just arrived, pulling into her driveway while they were there. They watched her get out of her car, looking tired and withdrawn, and waited until she was inside before knocking on her door.

When she opened it, the officers said she seemed out of it, almost as if she didn‚Äôt fully recognize them. She gave them a blank look, and when they asked for her name, she took a while to respond. Eventually, she mumbled her name in a soft voice, which was so out of character for her. Usually, Linda is chatty and warm, but the officers described her as distant, almost as if she were under some kind of emotional cloud. They mentioned she might be distressed or under the influence, but they couldn‚Äôt confirm anything.

After they left, I tried calling her to check in, but when she picked up, she still sounded off. Her voice was quiet, almost whisper-like, and she mumbled responses that didn‚Äôt make much sense. She didn‚Äôt seem angry with me, just‚Ä¶ different, as if something had happened that she couldn‚Äôt explain. I didn‚Äôt press her. I figured she‚Äôd reach out when she was ready. I couldn‚Äôt ignore the gnawing worry, but I told myself to give her some space.

The next morning, Linda called me. Her voice sounded more like her usual self, though still subdued. She began apologizing right away, saying she was sorry for not reaching out earlier. She assured me she was okay, but I could tell she was shaken by whatever had happened. I told her I was just glad she was safe, that I didn‚Äôt need an explanation unless she wanted to give one. All I wanted was to make sure she was okay.

Linda hesitated for a moment, then shared that the last few days had been a blur for her. She couldn‚Äôt clearly remember where she‚Äôd been or why she hadn‚Äôt come home. It was unsettling to hear this, but I didn‚Äôt push her for details. She promised she‚Äôd be more careful about letting me know if she ever had to leave again, and we agreed to reschedule her doctor‚Äôs appointment.

Over the following days, Linda slowly returned to her usual routine. She resumed her morning gardening and even invited me over for coffee. When we sat down together, she was quieter than usual, but she seemed more at ease. She expressed gratitude for my concern and confided that she wasn‚Äôt used to people worrying about her. Her family, she said, rarely checked in, and it was touching for her to know that someone cared.

Linda never elaborated on what happened during those missing days, and I didn‚Äôt bring it up again. I sensed that she needed time to process it herself. Sometimes, I wonder if it was simply the weight of everything she‚Äôs been carrying‚Äîthe health problems, the strained family ties, the loneliness. Whatever it was, I felt glad to be someone she could count on, even if just as a neighbor.

In the weeks that followed, we became even closer. Linda started joining us for small gatherings at our home, and she even introduced me to a few of her friends. She seemed happier, more connected. It was rewarding to see her open up more, to know that just being there for her made a difference. I think she realized that she didn‚Äôt have to go through everything alone.

For me, this experience was a reminder of how much a little kindness can mean to someone who feels isolated. Linda might not have the family support she deserves, but now she knows she has a friend who cares. And in a way, she‚Äôs become family to us. I‚Äôm grateful that she‚Äôs safe, that she‚Äôs letting people in, and that she‚Äôs found a little more peace.",8,1729931456.0,mystery,0,0.9,False
1gcghuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1gcghuy/to_an_unreal_infp/,To an unreal INFP,"Hello chat. INTJ-A 20s male here to share a story that I just decided to wrap up and leave behind a few days ago. Midnight seems right for the mood lol.

I had a crush on her last winter (approx. 1 year ago); it was a weird feeling, more like a combination of curiosity and confusion that I had on this girl; and I wanted to know more about how she sees the world. So we started hanging out (well look, neither of us is very socializing and so the time we spent together might be pretty awkward events to most ppl). I could still roughly remember the classical PNW rainy days when she‚Äôd wait for me to finish my rehearsal in that creepy sub-basement music building and we‚Äôd walk together to explore different stuff every week ‚Äî journal club, coffee, concerts, coffee, or just randomly wandering, in the rain, as slowly as we can (I‚Äôm usually a fast walker fyi). We spend entire afternoons watching traffic where she babbles about her childhood, showing pictures that she took on trips, sharing weird jokes that perfectly fits my sense of humor. And I was usually just staring at her and zoning out ‚Äî‚Äî never found a more comfortable time to zone out other than being with her, from the library to the lawn.

Speaking of coffee, I‚Äôve never tried anything else other than 16oz Iced Americano (period). I still won‚Äôt try anything non-black, but somehow I started to care about her coffee orders and sometimes she was so surprised at how I brought her the flavor that she wanted for the day (to me it‚Äôs just a pattern lol but I‚Äôd never tell her that); I would just tell her that I always discover smth new and fun out of her and I love spending all my free time with her.

I haven‚Äôt met a ton of INFPs in my life so I couldn‚Äôt, and don‚Äôt want to, stereotype them the way I feel with her; but like I said, it‚Äôs a refreshing sensation, hugely contrasting my everyday lifestyle of orderly planning out everything and always being in the position of trying to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù stuff that deviate from my planned path. Her life, wow, is just full of colors, art, poetry (they‚Äôre soooo good), dancing, and the ability to make up hilarious stories about puppies being friends with plants (she used to call me a certified plant hater tho).

She got me into so many new fields and realms of things that I found boring/unnecessary/just childish before (well turns out I‚Äôm also a kid by heart lol); I still enjoy doing these stuff nowadays and I don‚Äôt think I could go back.

And indeed I found it a hard time when she disappeared all of a sudden, right before the day we were supposed to meetup after summer break, not long from the last time we said ‚Äútalk to you later‚Äù at the end of a 2hr call.

My workplace colleagues suggest that I should perhaps spend more time with my family or socialize more to make more friends; yet maybe only I felt the nerves of missing someone whose presence alone could calm me down in my stressed times.

It was, as the topic suggests, an unreal experience to me, and I understand that not many ppl can resonate (nw I have no expectations); I‚Äôve mostly moved on from it after visiting a different city for a week earlier this month, and despite of the fact that I would probably never feel comfortable to open up my heart again, I just decided to leave it as a story to tell.

Finally, I want to say thank you to the not many INFPs I‚Äôve met in my life so far; you‚Äôre a group of very nice and beautiful people in my heart.",2,1729931443.0,infp,1,1.0,False

Hospital week non and we were both dancers but on another team. She had a crush on me kahit di pa kami magkakilala. She was on the same team as my friend na naging tulay samin dalawa. She would post stories of me dancing, and would post stories na puro patama sakin at may initials ko pa kahit hindi kami friends sa fb. My friend was the one who showed me her stories. Few days after, inadd nya na ako sa fb. We became friends, she would offer coffee and would send a lot of memes. Ang effort nya, and with typical wlw, nag i love you na 1 week after talking.

We would see each other almost everyday, pag gani naman, inaantay ko syang sunduin ng kuya nya pero pinapauwi nya na ako bago pa dumating kuya nya. She said she lives with her kuya and the family of her kuya so okay. Buti naman at hatid sundo. 

Everything was great! We would go out have some coffee and spend our free time together. Inaya nya akong mag camping, and so we did. I was the happiest nung mga time na yon. I spent the New year with her sa hospital since duty sya but I didnt mind. Im just happy to be with her. She took me out on my birthday. I would say na sobrang ma effort nya. Although I loved her and I was happy to be with her, I never had the assurance na gusto ko altho d ko naman na bibring up ang issue. After our camping, I asked if pwede ako makiconnect sa wifi nya, I was looking at her phone nung nag show password sya, the pssword was a name of a guy. Kumirot dibdib ko and d ko man lang sya natanong about it. 

Few months passed, we were planning to bring her dog sa vet nag aantay lang ako chat nya nang biglang na cancel kasi masakit daw puson nya. We were talking sa IG ng biglang nakatanggap ako ng chat na nag papakilala ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù nya at kung ayaw ko raw ng gulo, sesend ko lahat ng convo namin sa kanya. Te! Nanlamig ako, natakot ako for her kasi accdg sa kanya abusive yung guy. Sinet aside ko muna ang sakit kasi nag aalala ako sa kanya. What I did was call her family kahit walang nakakakilala sakin maliban sa pinsan nyang babae. Eto na nga, whats worse ay nung tumawag ako sa family, hindi naman daw sya nakikitira sa kuya nya.   Nasa isip ko boyfriend nya kasama nya sa bahay, at ang nag hahatid sundo sa kanya. Sobrang gulo ng araw na yon, mamaya pa nakatanggap ako ng balita na pumanaw na lola ko. Namanhid ako, hindi ko alam san ako lulugar at anong dapat ko maramdaman. Damang dama ko pag guho ng mundo ko, ni isanv luha walang tumutulo. 

Kinabukasan nag chat sya sakin, she was thanking me that I saved her and wala na kmi masyadong napag usapan. She went on leave sa work and nung pabalik na sya, ako naman aalis para sa wale ng lola ko. She asked to see me and we talked. Di ko alam anong ibg nyang sabihin ‚Äúyou are worth fighting for‚Äù. So ayon, hinatid ko sya sa terminal and I left the ff day.

Habang bumibyahe ako pauwi, naktanggap ako ng chat galing sa pamilya nya nag mamakaawa na layuan ko anak nila dahil ilang araw na raw di kumakain. May pangarap syang mag abroad ngunit hindi sya susuportahan hanggat nasa buhay pa ako ng anak nila. Ganon kalala. Hndi ko sinagot ng maayos sa sobrang gulo pa ng utak ko. I just mourned nung umuwi ako. Mind you, di kami nag uusap nyan. 

When I got back, nag usap ulit kami. This time sabi nya she needs to fix eveything bago nya ako ipursue, she would want to pursue me pag nakaalis na sya ng pinas. Syempre naniwala ako, mahal ko e. She said that she is letting me go for now, ayaw nya madamay ako sa gulo and that Im free to date pero masasaktan sya. So I gave her assurance na sya lang, at mag aantay ako. So ayon, nagulat nalang ako halos blocked ako mapa IG, FB, at tiktok. Gumawa sya ng dump acct at don kami nag uusap, mama nya raw may hawak, so okay.

Few days passed, I went out with my friend kasi birthday nya. Kumain kami sa resto and unexpectedly, nandon din sya. Hindi nya ako nakita, di rin kami magkausap that time ksi d naman sya nag chchat. Bigla nalang dumating ang guy and sabi ng friend ko na ex nya raw yung guy! Yes the abusive one, dumating sa resto and they were having a triple date. OMFG, right there and then binlock ko sya sa lahat ng soc med platform maging contact number. I feel so stupid.
That night, I just thank God for the pain sa sobrang manhid ko na.

During the time na binlock ko sya, nagpaparamdam ang guy friend ko na pinag seselosan nya. I warned the guy na I dont like him and that Im not ready and that bros kami pero he was persistent so I allowed him to court me. Araw araw nya kaming nakikitang magkasama and I didnt care. Pero turned down parin ang guy kasi nga, di tlaga kaya ng badinv na kagaya ko.

A month after blocking, inunblock ko sya at sinabi ko reason why I blocked her. Teh! Sya pang nag attitude that Im quick to judge and wala syang pake. My ghad the kapal ng mukha. Simula non grabe ni katiting na pagmamahal nawala na. Dating baliw na baliw sa kanya, ngayon halos matawa nalang ako.


Right now, I am at peace. My heart is happy, secured and contented. I gave a chance to someone who admired me na matagal na. She  (30F) noticed how I changed from being madly in love, to being vulnerable, devastated, to being mean, then suddenly became calm. I can confidently say that I am in a healthy relationship. She never fed my insecurities, never made me feel like an option and my opinion matters. I feel so loved, seen, and known. She knows every small details of me, my go to place, my fave food, mu fave color and even the slightest change in my mood. She would always say na ang swerte nya sakin but I would always say otherwise. Despite her being busy, I never begged for time. I never begged for attention. She is very transparent, she even gave her card to me na pinapasukn ng sweldo nya para mabili ko wants and needs. But I never took advantage of that and would always send it back to her. 

If mababalik man ang panahon, dadaanan ko pa rin lahat ng sakit na naranasan ko. If it will lead me to her, I wouldnt mind. I‚Äôd die for her.

I‚Äôm not sure if the horror stories are the norm or just a few unlucky defective units‚Ä¶ but I definitely saw more negative reviews than for the Z10. However there is I believe a two year difference between the release dates. Perhaps the Giga 10 got better? 
Please help a fellow coffee enthusiast decide!

1gcgbk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/1gcgbk0/duration_of_first_datesquick_escapes/,Duration of first dates/quick escapes ,"I recall seeing an old episode of Frasier where he sets up a date and he meets the woman for a coffee. Iirc he says something along the lines of people getting a pre arranged phone call from a friend 5 minutes into the date so they can bail on the date if first impressions are bad.

Has that happened to anyone? Is it a good idea? Thoughts

And regarding first dates what's peoples ideal duration? For me I'd say 30 minutes...enough time to drink and talk a bit but not too much.if things go well you can always arrange to meet again. I know there's lots of factors as if I was traveling for the date I'd probably want a longer duration and ditto if I had chatted a lot before a real life meeting",1,1729930657.0,OnlineDating,2,1.0,False
1gcgb2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gcgb2u/to_say_yes_or_no/,To say yes or no?,"I need some advice on whether or not to go forwards with a relationship. It's not a relationship yet, but it's moving in that direction and I don't know what to do.

I (21f) have known Mike (21M) for years. We went to high school together. We only knew of each other until about grade 10 when we had our first classes together. From there we became acquaintances. We ran in different circles. Mike was generally considered oneof the weird kids, but I enjoyed his company, and that of his friends. I generally get along with people easily, but with Mike it was always different. I sought him out because he made me laugh, and debated random topics with me. It was only in our senior year that we really became friends. We first started hanging out together after our graduation. I always enjoyed hanging out with him. We would talk for hours on end.

The problems started early. My friends don't like him. The reason they don't like him is because he's not like our other male friends. We like to party, we enjoy drinking and smoking. Mike doesn't do any of that. He enjoys staying home, playing, games, reading, and learning. Not to say we don't enjoy those things. Because we do. But when my friends think of what to do to hang out, there is always alcohol and bad decisions involved. When Mike thinks of something to do with his friends, it's online games. Which I don't mind. Because I can see why people enjoy it.

So they don't like him, because he doesn't enjoy the same things they do. But Mike has gone out with me and my friends.

That's sort of where the next problem comes in. Mike asked me out right after graduation. I wasn't ready for a relationship at the time. I was going to university in a few months, and I wanted to experience life and bad decisions before settling into a relationship. Because with Mike it was always going to be a long term commitment. I explained this to Mike and he said that he understood. We went out a few weeks later, with my friends (his didn't want to go to a bar). I got very drunk, (the legal drinking age in my country is 18) and parts of the night are very blurry. I went home and the next day I went away on holiday so I didn't have signal. When I got signal again I had multiple messsages.

Mike had messaged my friends that he did something terrible the night before, he didn't know if he should tell me, and he felt terrible. He had gone home early the night before and replied to a girl who dm'd him a few days before. He and she had exchanged... pictures. He says he did this because the night before I had... met... a few guys. My friends told him that I wouldn't care since we weren't together. Which I didn't. I told him the same thing.

That's almost three years ago now.

In the meantime, we've stayed in contact in bits and pieces. Usually it's him messaging me and me ghosting him. I'd answer him and then ghost him, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally. We'd bump into each other at random and go for coffee. We'll talk for a bit and then lose contact for a few months. I admit that I am the problem. But Mike has put in the extra mile and always forgiven me. I know I don't deserve it. Or him.

He asked me out again about a year and a half ago. At that time I was in a situationship with Rodger (24m). Rodger and I broke up about a year ago and I swore off all relationships. I've had an extremely difficult year and decided to focus on my studies and my job and my siblings. Rodger lives off his families money and didn't understand that I had responsibilities outside of him. But whenever I talk to Mike, he understands. He lets me vent without judgement and always asks whether I want someone to be angry with me or someone to talk me through it.

Mike is really amazing. Despite me ghosting him, and treating him like dirt, Mike will aways wait a few weeks before texting me again as if nothing ever happened. I really don't deserve him. He's been waiting for me and trying to date me. And I've realised that he's been basically doing everything for me that I've always wanted from a partner.

Recently I've done a lot of work on myself and I've realised that I really want to settle down. I want reliable. I want someone who puts in the effort for me. I want someone who puts up with my red flags but also calls me out on them. I want someone like Mike. For my friends it sounds basic. But my friends haven't grown into the whole 'grown-up' stable and reliable parts of their lives. Which is understandable. We're 21 and only just finishing up university.

It's been about a month since we last spoke and he messaged me again. I don't know if I should give him a chance. I've told him 'no' in the past but he's persistent. Do I go no contact? Do I give him a chance? I really want to give him a chance, but my friends really don't like Mike.

I've known my friends for over a decade and I really want to trust them, but I really don't know what to do. So I've turned to Reddit, because that's what sane people do these days.",1,1729930596.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1gcg9s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1gcg9s0/crush_on_a_coworker/,Crush on a coworker,"In June I found a new job and on the first day this girl, who was at her first day as well, approaches me because she found me the ""most normal"" among the other colleagues and thought we could get along.
We started working together on the same projects and we immediately clicked and had a great time, we are very similar and we've always said that it's like we've known each other for years.
Big problem: we both were in a relationship.
During the summer she started texting me and told me many times how she was missing me, that she would like to do some stuff together etc... I was pleased and I flirted a little bit but I was feeling bad because I had a gf.
Since we've met again in person she started confusing me a bit because she wouldn't say anything cute in person but sometimes she still texted me sweet messages.
Some weeks ago I decided to broke up with my gf (10 yrs together) because there were some issues that we really couldn't solve and this coworker it's been a sort of wake up call that I wasn't in love anymore but I didn't do it to go with this other girl.
The coworker was a bit ""shocked"", the day after I told her I broke up with my gf she got anxious and started pushing me to meet other colleagues that she would think I would like, she acted insane and it was awkward.
The main thing is that she keeps giving me confusing messages. Sometimes she is so cute, she would touch me, give me kisses on the cheeks but on the other hand when I propose her to do some stuff together she often says ""let's invite the others too!"". I must say that in the last days we've met for a coffee after work but we were just me and her because the others couldn't come.
In addition, she speaks about her boyfriend that's buying a house and she tells me that she is looking forward to go live there.
I don't know what to do. I would like to tell her everything even tho I know she knows (when I told her about the problems with my ex gf she even asked me ""is it because you find someone attractive at work?"" And ""how's your type of girl?"") but she also told me that I'm a bit paranoid and she doesn't know why.
Do you have advice on how to deal with it? Should I try to meet her and make things explicit or just go with it and wait?
