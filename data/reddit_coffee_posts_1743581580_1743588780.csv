I turned and walked quickly away into the maze of alleys, alone with the sound of my own laughter echoing off the walls.

Or was it mine? Hard to tell anymore.

The Tokyo night swallowed me. Neon signs flickering overhead. Incomprehensible characters that somehow felt more honest than English. At least here the words admitted I couldn't understand them.

Six months since Sarah left. Six months since she'd said the words that still echo in my skull. ""There has to be glass between people, Ryan. Space. That's where actual connection happens. Not in trying to become the same person.""

I didn't get it then. Glass meant separation. Space meant distance. I'd spent my whole life trying to eliminate those things.

Mom's voice in my head: ""Ryan, where are you going? Did you take your medicine? Did you finish your homework? Are you wearing the blue shirt I laid out?""

Every question a tether. Every answer a reassurance that I was still there, still visible, still doing exactly what she expected. After Dad left when I was seven, I became her project. Her certainty. Her one controllable thing in a world that had betrayed her.

I learned the rules quickly. Keep your room perfectly organized. Anticipate needs before they're expressed. Don't create problems. Don't be unpredictable. Make yourself essential but never difficult.

""You're such a good boy, Ryan. Not like your father. You'd never leave.""

And I never did. Not really. Not until Sarah forced my hand.

I checked my watch. 11:42 PM. I pulled out my phone. Three messages from Diego. Two from Emma. Even one from Lisa. These people I barely knew, worried about me. The sensation was unfamiliar. Uncomfortable.

Mom never worried when I was exactly where she expected me to be, doing exactly what she'd planned. Sarah never worried because I made sure everything was taken care of before she could even think to be concerned.

I found myself at a small park. Deserted at this hour. A vending machine hummed nearby, its light creating a small island in the darkness. I bought a can of coffee, the liquid warm in my hand.

I sat on a bench, remembering the day Mom had her first real panic attack. I was thirteen. Came home twenty minutes late from school because Mark Stevens had invited me to see his new bike. Just twenty minutes. Found her on the kitchen floor, hyperventilating, certain I'd been kidnapped or hit by a car or decided to leave like Dad.

I never came home late again. Built my life around her certainties. Her schedules. Her expectations.

When she died my senior year of college, I felt both grief and a shameful relief that I didn't recognize until therapy years later. But by then, the patterns were set. I'd transferred them seamlessly to Sarah.

The coffee was too sweet. I drank it anyway.

My phone buzzed. Diego: ""You okay man? We're heading back to the hostel. Let us know you're safe.""

I stared at the message. The simple concern in it. No demands. No expectations. Just genuine worry for my well-being.

Mom would have sent twenty messages by now. Would have called the police. Would have needed detailed explanations and promises it would never happen again.

Sarah, near the end, wouldn't have messaged at all. She'd grown tired of my constant updates, my need to know where she was, my suggestions for how her day should proceed.

I texted back: ""I'm fine. Need some time. See you later.""

Simple. Honest. No elaborate excuses or reassurances.

I looked up and caught my reflection in the vending machine's glass front. Just one reflection this time. Just me, sitting alone on a bench in a foreign country, halfway across the world from everything familiar.

""You look like Dad in that light.""

Mom's words from my high school graduation. She hadn't meant it as a compliment. Dad, who had left us. Dad, who had chosen freedom over family. Dad, who had broken her heart and, by extension, committed an unforgivable crime against us both.

I never knew him well enough to see the similarities myself. Just fragments of memories — his laugh, the way he'd lift me onto his shoulders, his arguments with Mom that I'd overhear from my bedroom.

""You're suffocating me, Karen. Watching every move. Planning every minute.""

""I'm trying to create stability for our son!""

""You're creating a prison for all of us.""

Their final fight, the night before he left. I'd heard it all from the top of the stairs, seven years old and trying to understand what it meant to suffocate someone without touching them.

Now, at thirty-two, I finally understood. I'd become my mother. Had done to Sarah exactly what Mom had done to Dad, to me. Created a prison of perfect care, of anticipated needs, of suffocating attention.

And like Dad, Sarah had eventually chosen freedom.

Another reflection appeared in the vending machine glass. Me, but younger. Around seven, with a child's unguarded expression.

""Is it really you?"" I whispered.

The child-me said nothing, just watched with curious eyes. Not judging. Not accusing. Just witnessing.

I reached out toward the glass. The child didn't mimic the movement. Instead, he pointed to my phone.

I looked down at it. The screen showed my text conversation with Diego, his concern and my brief response.

When I looked up again, the child reflection was gone. Just my adult face staring back, distorted slightly by the curved glass.

I stood up, tossed the empty coffee can into a recycling bin, and started walking again. Tokyo at midnight felt both chaotic and orderly. Intense activity contained within clear boundaries. Freedom within structure.

I thought of Dad again. Had tried so hard not to over the years. Mom had removed all his photos after he left. Returned letters he sent me unopened. Eventually, he'd stopped trying to contact us.

Last I heard, he was living in Arizona. Remarried. Two kids from the new marriage. A whole life I knew nothing about. I'd found him on Facebook once, five years ago. His profile picture showed him laughing on a hiking trail, arm around a woman about Mom's age but somehow lighter, less burdened.

I hadn't sent a friend request. Had closed the laptop, gone to Sarah's apartment, and proposed three weeks later.

Now I wondered: had I been running from becoming him for so long that I'd overcorrected into becoming Mom instead?

I reached a main street. Shibuya or Shinjuku, I couldn't remember which was which yet. Crowds even at this hour. Massive screens overhead, flashing advertisements. More reflective surfaces than I could count.

I kept my eyes forward, afraid of what I might see in all that glass. But strangely, the reflections had stopped. Or at least, they'd normalized. Each shop window I passed just showed me as I was — disheveled, tired, alone, but fully present.

My phone buzzed again. Not Diego this time, but an email notification. From Dad. As if my thoughts had somehow summoned it.

Subject: Saw you're in Japan Message: Your Instagram came up in my feed somehow. Looks like you're traveling. That's great. I spent a month in Kyoto when I was about your age. Changed everything for me. Would love to hear from you if you're ever ready. No pressure. - Dad

I stared at the screen. Ten years since his last attempt to contact me. Had he been following me online all this time? The thought should have felt invasive, but somehow it didn't. Just sad. A father watching his son's life from behind glass.

I pocketed the phone without replying. Not ready for that conversation yet. Maybe never would be.

The hostel was a twenty-minute walk. I could go back, face Diego and the others. Explain... what? That I'd had a psychotic break? Seen myself multiplied in a window? That I was just another tourist having a bad trip?

Or I could find another hostel. Start over. Become someone new again.

My hand went to my pocket, touched the folded paper I'd carried since Chicago. Sarah's final note, left on our kitchen counter.

""I've tried to tell you this so many times, but you never really hear me. You're so busy managing life that you're not living it. I need to go somewhere you haven't already planned out for me. Maybe someday you'll understand what I mean about the glass between people. I hope you find someone who needs what you offer. I'm sorry that person isn't me.""

I'd read it so many times the creases were starting to tear. Had analyzed every word, looking for hidden messages, for hope, for a path back to her.

But maybe she'd meant exactly what she wrote. Maybe I hadn't heard her because I'd been too busy planning my response instead of truly listening. Too focused on solving the problem of her unhappiness rather than understanding it.

I stopped walking. Found myself before a large department store. Closed now, but the façade was entirely glass. In it, I saw not multiple versions of myself, but a single reflection.

Behind it, almost like a projection, I could see Mom in her final years. Small, bitter, alone in her immaculate house. Everything in its proper place. No one allowed close enough to disrupt the order she'd created.

Is that who I'd become in another twenty years, if something didn't change?

My phone buzzed again. An actual call this time. Diego.

I answered without planning what to say.

""Hey,"" his voice, concerned but not panicked. ""Just making sure you're alive.""

""I'm alive,"" I said.

""Good. We're at the hostel. Emma made tea.""

Such a simple statement. No demands. No expectations. Just information freely offered.

""I'll be there soon,"" I said.

""Cool. Or not. Whatever you need, man.""

Whatever I needed. When was the last time someone had said that without already having decided what my answer should be?

I ended the call and looked at my reflection once more. Still just one version of me. But somehow, it felt like a more complete version than I'd been in the restaurant. The face looking back at me carried traces of Mom's anxious care, Dad's restless freedom, Sarah's guarded distance, even Diego's easy acceptance.

All those people existed within me. Had shaped me. Glass between us, yes, but also glass that reflected parts of them back to me.

I started walking toward the hostel. Didn't know yet if I was going back to this particular group, to Diego's tea and Emma's concern. But I was moving forward, not running away.

And for now, that was enough.

Hard to sleep that night. Kept seeing faces in the shadows. My faces. Mom's eyes looking through mine. Dad's mouth. Sarah's disappointment.

I'd made it back to the hostel around 1 AM. Everyone asleep except Diego. He'd just nodded when I came in. No questions. No demands for explanations. Just pushed a mug of tea across the common room table, already cold but still there. Waiting.

""Thanks,"" I'd said. For the tea. For the space. For not making me explain.

""No problem,"" he'd answered. Then went back to his bunk.

Simple. Why was simple so fucking hard for me?

Morning now. Tokyo waking up outside. Noise and light filtering through cheap curtains.

I reached for my phone. Checked my messages before remembering – no one to report to anymore. No one waiting for my ""Good morning, here's my plan for the day"" text. No Sarah to manage. No Mom to reassure.

Just me. But which me?

The hostel bathroom was cramped. Three sinks, three mirrors. I avoided looking directly at them as I brushed my teeth. Wasn't ready for what I might see.

""You survived the night!"" Emma's voice behind me, too cheerful for 7 AM. Australian. Everything a joke to hide the seriousness underneath.

""Barely,"" I said, rinsing my mouth.

""Looks like you saw a ghost in that restaurant.""

I looked up then. Couldn't help it. Mirror right there. But just me looking back. Tired eyes. Three-day stubble. None of the Other Ryans from last night.

""Something like that.""

""Well, we're heading to Meiji Shrine today. You in?""

Was I? Part of me wanted to hide. Find a capsule hotel where no one would ask questions. Start over tomorrow with new people who didn't see me freak out.

Old Ryan would have already planned an excuse. Perfect words to slip away without causing offense. New Ryan had no fucking clue what to do.

""Yeah,"" I said finally. ""I'm in.""

She smiled, genuine. No hidden agenda I could detect. ""Great! Kenji says it's super peaceful there. Might be good for...""

""My clearly unstable mental state?""

Emma laughed, not meanly. ""I was going to say 'for your jetlag' but sure, that works too.""

I almost smiled back.

The shrine was exactly what I needed. Huge trees creating shadows and light. Wide gravel paths where you could see people coming from a distance. No surprises. No reflective surfaces except one small pond near a side garden.

Kenji explained the purification ritual at the entrance. Water to clean our hands and mouths. Simple movements that felt ancient. Respectful.

""You pour with the right hand first, then left,"" he demonstrated. ""Then cup water in your right palm to rinse your mouth.""

I followed the steps carefully. Wanting to get it right. Wanting to be respectful. Old habits. But this time it felt different. Not about control but about connection. To tradition. To something bigger than my fractured self.

Diego hung back with me as the others walked ahead.

""You want to talk about last night?"" he asked.

""Not really.""

""Cool.""

We walked in silence for a minute. Gravel crunching under our shoes.

""But if I did?"" I found myself asking.

""I'd listen.""

Simple words. But they hit something in me. When had anyone ever just listened? Mom always had solutions. Schedules. Medications. Sarah had theories about my ""issues"" from all the psychology books she'd read.

""I saw myself,"" I said before I could stop it. ""Not just once. Like, twenty versions of me. All watching from that window. All different but all me. Some angry. Some sad. Some like they knew something I didn't.""

Diego nodded, face serious. ""In Peru, my uncle once drank ayahuasca with a shaman. Said he spent the night talking to different versions of himself. Past selves. Future selves. The self he might have been if he'd made different choices.""

""Did they think he was crazy?""

""No. They thought he was lucky. Most people never see themselves clearly. Only the mask they show others.""

I thought about that. My reflections hadn't been wearing masks. They'd been raw. Exposed. Everything I tried to hide from others. From myself.

""I think I've been living behind glass,"" I said. ""Watching life instead of being in it.""

Diego stopped walking. Looked at me directly.

""That's a heavy realization, man.""

""Yeah.""

Ahead of us, Emma was taking photos of massive wooden gates. Lisa was reading something from a guidebook to Kenji, who was politely pretending he didn't already know whatever she was telling him.

Normal people doing normal tourist things. Not having existential crises in sacred spaces.

""Sarah told me something when she left,"" I said. ""That there has to be glass between people. Space. That connection happens there, not in trying to become the same person.""

""Smart woman.""

""I thought she meant distance. Separation. But maybe...""

My phone buzzed. Email notification. Dad again.

Subject: Sorry Message: Didn't mean to intrude. Just good to see you out exploring the world. Your mother always wanted everything planned and certain. You seemed to be breaking free of that. Proud of you. - Dad

Five minutes ago, this would have made me angry. How dare he judge Mom? How dare he be proud when he wasn't there? But now, with Diego beside me and last night's reflections still fresh in my mind, it felt different.

Dad saw me. Or at least, saw something in me worth noticing. Not managing. Not fixing. Just seeing.

We reached a massive tree with paper prayers tied to its branches. Omikuji, Kenji had called them. Fortunes and wishes.

""Want to write one?"" Diego asked.

A nearby stand provided small pieces of paper and pencils for a few yen. I paid without thinking about it.

What to write? A wish? A prayer? A hope for the future?

I stared at the blank paper. So many possibilities. The old Ryan would have agonized over finding the perfect words. The exact right sentiment.

Instead, I wrote simply: ""Help me see clearly.""

Tied it to the tree with all the others. Hundreds of hopes and wishes fluttering in the breeze.

That's when I saw her. Not in a reflection this time, but standing across the open courtyard.

Sarah.

Impossible, of course. She was in Chicago. Had no idea where I was. Couldn't be here.

But there she was. Or someone who looked exactly like her. Same dark hair. Same way of standing with weight shifted to one hip. Same oversized sweater she always wore when traveling.

""You okay?"" Diego's voice seemed distant.

""I need to..."" I didn't finish. Just started walking toward her.

She turned slightly, profile now visible. Not Sarah. Of course not Sarah. Just another tourist with dark hair. Nothing like her up close.

I stopped, embarrassed. Heart pounding like I'd been running.

When I turned back, Diego had wandered toward the others. Giving me space without being asked. Respecting the glass between us.

And in that moment, I finally understood what Sarah had meant.

The glass wasn't a barrier. It was a membrane. Permeable. Necessary. Without it, we suffocate each other. Try to make others into extensions of ourselves. With it, we remain separate but connected. Distinct but not isolated.

I'd been trying to eliminate the glass. Between me and Mom. Between me and Sarah. Maybe even between the different parts of myself.

No wonder I was seeing fragments everywhere I looked.

I walked back to the group slowly. They'd moved on to a small garden area. Emma taking more photos. Lisa consulting her guidebook. Kenji pointing out something to Diego.

Normal people doing normal things. But now I saw the glass between them too. The space they naturally maintained. Not distance. Not isolation. Just the healthy separation that allowed each to remain themselves while still connecting.

My phone buzzed again. Text from an unknown Japanese number.

""This is Tanaka-san. Kenji gave me your number. The fish eye sees everything but judges nothing. Come back when you are ready. No charge.""

I stared at the message. How had he known? What had he seen?

I looked up at my new friends, these people I barely knew but who had already accepted me. Fragments and all. No need to be perfect. No need to manage every interaction.

Felt strange. Terrifying. Freeing.

For the first time in months, maybe years, I took a deep breath that filled my lungs completely. Let it out slowly. Felt something loosen in my chest.

""Ready to continue?"" Kenji asked as I approached.

""Yeah,"" I said. And meant it. ""I'm ready.""

We spent the whole day exploring Tokyo. Temples. Markets. Places tourists go and places they don't. Kenji leading, rest of us following. But something was wrong. Off. Each time I caught my reflection in store windows, subway car glass, puddles on the street – it lagged. Moved a second after I did. Smiled when I wasn't smiling.

No one else noticed. Or if they did, they didn't say anything.

By evening, back at the hostel, I was twitchy. Seeing movement from the corner of my eye. Turning to find nothing. Feeling watched constantly.

""You okay?"" Diego asked on the hostel roof. Cheap beers. Combini snacks. Tokyo's light pollution hiding the stars.

""I want to go back to that restaurant,"" I said suddenly.

Four heads turned toward me. Concern on each face.

""You sure?"" Lisa asked.

""Need to. Need to see.""

""See what?"" Emma's voice had lost its usual laugh.

I couldn't answer. Couldn't explain that my reflections were getting bolder. Closer. One had waved at me from a passing car window. Another had mouthed words I couldn't make out from a hotel lobby as we walked by.

""I'll come with you,"" Diego said.

""We all will,"" Emma added, though her voice wavered slightly.

Kenji looked uncertain. ""Tanaka-san might not appreciate group return after..."" He searched for diplomatic wording.

""After I lost my shit?"" I finished for him.

He smiled slightly. ""I was going to say 'after unexpected departure.'""

""I got a text from him,"" I said. Pulled out my phone to show them.

But the message was different now. Not what I remembered reading.

""THE REFLECTIONS ARE HUNGRY. COME BACK.""

My hand shook. I closed the message before anyone could see it.

""He invited me back,"" I said weakly.

That night, sleep wouldn't come. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw faces. My faces. Watching from the darkness behind my eyelids. Whispering things I couldn't quite hear.

I slipped out of bed at 3 AM. Grabbed my phone. Went to the common room.

The hostel's long mirror caught my movement as I entered. But my reflection didn't match. It stood facing me directly while I was in profile. When I turned to face it, it turned away. When I raised my hand, it remained still.

""What do you want?"" I whispered.

The reflection's mouth moved. No sound. But I could read the words.

""EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.""

I backed out of the room. Heart hammering. Back pressed against the hallway wall.

No mirror here. No reflective surfaces. Just dim emergency lights and silence.

My phone buzzed in my hand. Email notification. From Dad.

I opened it with trembling fingers.

""Son, I've been seeing your photos online. But there's something wrong with them. There's someone in the background of each one. Someone who looks like you but isn't you. Are you okay? Should I be worried?""

Attached was a screenshot of my Instagram. Me in front of a Tokyo temple. And behind me, partially hidden in shadow, another Ryan. Watching. Smiling too widely.

I hadn't posted any photos since arriving in Japan.

Deleted the email. Turned off the phone. Slid down the wall until I was sitting on the floor.

What was happening to me?

Next evening. Same narrow alley. Same vending machines. Same lanterns. But everything distorted somehow. Colors too bright. Shadows too dark. Sounds muffled like I was underwater.

Tanaka-san's place looked wrong. Door slightly crooked. Blue curtain tattered at the edges.

Inside, same counter. Same seats. Same focused lighting. But no people. No Tanaka-san. No other customers.

Just emptiness. And silence.

""Hello?"" My voice echoed slightly. Impossible in such a small space.

Movement from behind the counter. Someone rising slowly into view. Tanaka-san, but wrong somehow. Skin too pale. Eyes too dark. Movements jerky, mechanical.

""You came back,"" he said. Voice distorted. Multiple tones layered over each other.

I looked toward the door. Couldn't see my friends. Hadn't they been right behind me?

""Where is everyone?"" I asked.

""They're here. They've always been here.""

He gestured toward the window. The one where I'd seen my reflections before.

But now it showed the restaurant interior, doubled. My friends sitting at the counter. Eating. Laughing. Another Ryan with them. Perfectly integrated. Smiling at something Kenji said.

""What is this?"" My voice shook.

""You wanted to understand the glass between people."" Not-Tanaka smiled, teeth too sharp, too numerous. ""Now you can experience it. From the outside.""

I backed toward the door. It wasn't there anymore. Just solid wall.

""They won't miss you,"" Not-Tanaka continued. ""They already have a Ryan. A better one. One who doesn't see too much. Doesn't feel too deeply. Doesn't need too desperately.""

In the window, Mirror-Ryan laughed at something Emma said. Placed his hand briefly on Diego's shoulder. Comfortable. Confident. Everything I wasn't.

""This isn't real,"" I said. To convince myself more than anything.

""More real than you think."" Not-Tanaka's face shifted slightly. Features rearranging. Becoming more like mine. ""Reality is just the story we agree to tell each other. They've agreed to a story that doesn't include you anymore.""

I pressed my back against the wall where the door should be. ""What do you want?""

""What all reflections want eventually. To stop reflecting and start existing.""

Not-Tanaka—his face now a grotesque hybrid of his features and mine—moved around the counter. Each step wrong. Too fluid then too jerky. Like someone learning to use a body for the first time.

""Your mother built glass walls around you. Your father left you trapped behind them. Sarah saw them but couldn't break through. Now you've built them around yourself.""

He was closer now. Close enough that I could smell something wrong about him. Like metal and old fish.

""Perfect container for a reflection to become real.""

I slid along the wall, desperate for escape. Found myself at the window. Pressed my hands against it.

Could see my friends so clearly. Just inches away. Mirror-Ryan turned slightly, saw me watching. His smile widened. Raised his sake cup in mocking toast.

I pounded on the glass. ""Diego! Emma!""

They didn't react. Couldn't hear me.

""The glass between people,"" Not-Tanaka whispered, now right behind me. Breath cold against my neck. ""Sarah was right. It's where connection happens. But also where replacement happens.""

I spun around. Pushed past him. Ran to the back of the restaurant. Found the door to the garden courtyard from my memory.

Outside. Night air. Small pond reflecting moonlight.

And reflections. Hundreds of them. Standing around the garden. All me. All wrong in subtle ways. Some missing eyes. Some with mouths too wide. Some partially transparent. Some solid but distorted.

They began moving toward me. Slow. Deliberate. Hands outstretched.

""We've been waiting,"" they spoke in unison. My voice multiplied into cacophony. ""Waiting for you to see us. Acknowledge us. Let us in.""

I backed up against the pond edge. Nowhere else to go.

""You're not real,"" I said, voice breaking.

""We're as real as your mother's anxiety. As real as your father's absence. As real as Sarah's departure. All the things that shaped you. Made you. Broke you.""

They were closer now. A ring of my own faces, staring with hungry eyes.

""Each rejection. Each loss. Each moment of control or abandonment. We were born in those spaces. In the glass between you and the world.""

The closest one reached for my face. Fingers cold as ice.

""And now we want to live.""

I lost balance. Fell backward into the pond. Water closing over my head.

Opened my eyes underwater. Saw not the night sky above but a ceiling. Hostel ceiling. Fluorescent lights.

Gasped. Flailed. Realized I was in a bathtub. Fully clothed. Water freezing.

Diego leaning over me, face tight with worry. Emma behind him. Lisa at the doorway.

""He's awake,"" Diego called to someone I couldn't see.

""What happened?"" My teeth chattered.

""You were sleepwalking,"" Emma said. ""Talking to yourself in the mirror. Then you turned on the bath and got in. Wouldn't respond to us.""

""How long?""

""We found you ten minutes ago. You've been... not yourself since yesterday.""

I struggled to sit up. Water sloshing over the tub edge. ""Yesterday? The shrine?""

Diego and Emma exchanged glances.

""We never made it to any shrine,"" Diego said carefully. ""You started acting strange at breakfast. Talking to your reflection in the coffee shop window.""

Nothing made sense. My memories of the peaceful day felt so real. The shrine. The wooden prayer tablets. The realization about the glass between people.

""What day is it?""

""Still Thursday,"" Lisa said from the doorway. ""Day after the sushi place.""

One day. Not two. Everything since the restaurant—the shrine, the understanding, the growth—just hallucination? Dream?

""Where's Kenji?"" I asked, suddenly aware of his absence.

Another silent exchange of glances.

""He went to find the place again,"" Diego said. ""The restaurant. To talk to the chef.""

""Tanaka-san.""

""That's just it,"" Emma said. ""We can't find it. The alley. The restaurant. Nothing. Kenji's been searching for hours.""

Cold deeper than the bathwater spread through me.

""My phone,"" I said. ""Need to check something.""

Diego handed it to me. Water-spotted but working. I pulled up my messages. Found the text from the Japanese number.

Still there. But normal now: ""This is Tanaka-san. Kenji gave me your number. The fish eye sees everything but judges nothing. Come back when you are ready. No charge.""

Not the hungry reflections version I thought I'd seen.

""Help me up,"" I said.

They did. Brought towels. Clean clothes. Left me to change.

The bathroom mirror showed only me. Pale. Frightened. But moving correctly with my movements. Nothing unusual.

Until I turned to leave. Just for a second, in the periphery of my vision, my reflection remained facing the mirror while I faced away.

I froze. Slowly turned back.

Nothing abnormal now. Just my terrified face staring back.

""You okay in there?"" Diego called through the door.

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""Coming out.""

In the hostel common room, my friends waited. Concern clear on their faces.

""Kenji called,"" Lisa said. ""He can't find the restaurant. No one's heard of a sushi chef named Tanaka in that area.""

""That's impossible."" My voice sounded strange to my own ears. ""We were all there.""

""We were somewhere,"" Diego said cautiously. ""But the place Kenji took us... he can't locate it again.""

Emma leaned forward. ""Ryan, what happened to you at that window? What did you really see?""

I looked at each of them. The genuine concern. The fear. The confusion.

""I saw myself,"" I said finally. ""Not just one reflection. Many. All slightly wrong. All watching me. Wanting something from me.""

Instead of dismissing me, they listened. Really listened.

""And tonight,"" I continued, ""in the bath... I thought I was somewhere else. Back at the restaurant. But wrong. Distorted. The reflections were trying to... replace me.""

Saying it out loud should have made it sound crazy. Instead, it felt frighteningly real.

""We need to find that restaurant again,"" I said.

Diego shook his head. ""I don't think that's a good idea.""

""You don't understand. The reflections... they're still out there. Still watching. Still wanting in.""

As if to prove my point, the hostel window darkened suddenly. Not night falling—it was already night. Something blocking the light from outside.

Faces pressed against the glass. My faces. Dozens of them. Watching us with hungry eyes.

Emma screamed. Lisa backed away. Diego stood, positioning himself between us and the window.

""Still think I'm crazy?"" I asked, voice shaking.

The faces began to smile. A uniform, terrible smile.

My phone buzzed. Text message appearing on the screen.

""THE GLASS WON'T PROTECT YOU FOREVER.""

Outside, in Tokyo's endless sea of reflective surfaces, my fragmented selves were waiting. Watching. Growing stronger.

And somewhere between the maze of mirrored buildings and rain-slick streets, the real Tanaka-san's restaurant remained hidden. Waiting for me to find my way back.

To understand what it truly means to see yourself clearly, even when the reflection shows something you fear.

To learn whether the glass between people is meant to connect us—or imprison us.

To discover which version of me would finally emerge from this fractured existence.

Looking for advice,"I have no idea why it’s happening- but I am in maintenance ( or was) at 2.4 mg wegovy after over 2 years. My insurance stopped covering any weight loss drugs in January. I started with compound sema from IVIM. It didn’t seem to be working so I did a month on compounded Tirz . I had an insane sweet tooth and binged uncontrollably for 6 weeks. I switched back to the compound sema and still am gaining . I’m up 10 lbs since the switch . The food noise is back in full force. It could be that Tirz doesn’t work for me and the compound sema from Empower was just a fluke or a bad batch?. Either way I paid 499 a month for the compounded Torz and 399 for the compounded sema so I don’t mind buying from novo direct if I have to. I have 2 months of sema compound. I use IVIM. Has anyone experienced this when switching to the compounded version? I even upped my dose to 2.8… just to see. I have zero  positive side effects . I was happily maintaining at 2.4 for 1.5 years on Wegovy. Does anyone know which telehealth providers are doing novo direct? It’s not an option on Ivim yet. Because I was at my goal weight and now am 10-15 lbs from it my primary care doctor will not prescribe to me. Wegovy chaged my life in so many ways . My mental health improved and I take less anxiety meds, I stopped drinking alcohol (not a sip in 2 years) I didn’t have a problem with alcohol but addiction does run in my family so it’s nice to not ever want to drink. I also was able to quit smoking. I guess I’m a bit bummed about the compounds not working and wondering if anyone has had this experience … if you think maybe it was fluke and I should try compound tirz again from another pharmacy/ tele health or if you know who is writing RX to novo direct.

The 5K Your Way. Move Against Cancer initiative is not just about physical activity; it is about promoting overall well-being and offering a supportive network for those affected by cancer. It encourages individuals to engage in regular exercise, connect with others who understand their experiences, and enjoy the benefits of being part of a caring community.

Our goal is to help inspire and empower people impacted by cancer to live an active and fulfilling lifestyle. There is now overwhelming evidence to show that moving when living with or beyond cancer is better than sitting.
 
Our group meets on the last Saturday of each month at specific parkruns. We are not a running group, walking is encouraged. It’s for anyone affected by cancer, patients, family, friends, healthcare professionals. A support group with a difference with some chat and coffee!

Love is the boy 

Who watches the play

Sitting on the side

As the girl dances on stage

Love is the man

With his sweeping arms

He has rose flowers in hand

And promises on his lips

Why is it aging wine

Or a vodka shot?

Why not a sip of tea

Or a caffeine drip?

I want to dance on stage

Watch from afar

I want none of these things

And all of them

And if I must love—

Let it be like this:

A knock, not a parade.

A rhythm, not a serenade.

Hey, I say; do you wanna play?

Let's have tea; a cup of coffee

Discuss this thing between you and me

What do you want?

And what do I?

Let's talk with truth, no lie

Speak your piece and we can try

It not a run, or standing in place

But in between, a walk

Where I'll stop and admire

Sometimes run wild with desire

I've (32M) been living in Frankfurt for about 1.5 years now. As an Econ PhD candidate, I've realised that, apart from my husband, I've been mostly hanging out with friends from uni. I would like to break out of this little 'bubble' (if you like) to listen to a greater variety of perspectives from different walks of life. In my free time, I like singing, learning languages (I speak 5 fluently), and playing volleyball. I also teach German to refugees and asylum seekers in a language café.

For the past 2 hours I've been frantically looking for my glasses. My morning routine is always the same but after I finished my coffee to start work I went to pick up my glasses and they had disappeared into thin air. My flat is tiny but we are packing for moving next week and there are boxes everywhere. Looked everywhere, husband looked everywhere.

I did 4 things:

[Pulled 5 cards](https://imgur.com/a/find-glasses-s0BlWTG) with Lenormand (often used to find lost objects). Immediately that told me that the glasses were someone obvious (Sun), near something round (Ring) or where I had looked before (going round and round) but hidden (Clouds). I freaked out because my husband had just put the washing machine on (which goes round and round). Flowers could be near a flower vase on the table, or possibly near my toiletries for my morning beauty routine. Anchor told me that they were wedged/stuck somewhere.

Recited the [Si Quaeris](https://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Sancti/SAntoniusDePadova/SiQuaeris.html) \- a Latin prayer to Saint Anthony of Padua, Patron Saint of Lost Items

Performed a ritual to Seer, with the Goetic Words of Power method.

Performed one of the extra 36 Powers rituals from Stillness & Light book (GOM Patreon), which uses 2 Angels, Harachel & Metzerel. (I quickly performed the monthly empowerement first, which had only come out yesterday and which I had not had time to do yet).

After all these rituals, I got up again and thought of the cards. The Ring - a round shape, a ring-like shape. I thought, there are several big rolls of parcel tape on the floor by the coffee table near the couch, where I had been sitting drinking my coffee. Of course I had already looked there. This time I moved all the rolls, moved a bunch of cellophane plastic that was on top of them (like a big fluffy CLOUD) and a sheet of paper which was also covering things. Guess what? The glasses were right there, on the floor, hidden by the tape, plastic and paper.

It goes without saying that my gratitude and praise extends to ALL the above entities who assisted me - Saint Anthony, Prince Seer and the Great Angels Harachel and Metzerel - not to mention to my Lenormand teachers who taught me to read the system.

And now I can relax!

EDIT: I know that hammering an issue with Magick is not the best strategy and that less is more, but I was truly desperate because I'm moving in just over a week, I don't have time to get a new pair made, not to mention the cost, which would have been about £400 /over $500 USD.",4,1743585394.0,GalleryOfMagick,0,1.0,False

1jpk7l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1jpk7l8/paris_trip_review_march_2731/,Paris Trip Review (March 27-31),"

Hello everyone! Since I found a lot of useful (but sometimes incomplete) information here while planning my trip, I wanted to share my experience to help others.

I traveled with my boyfriend, and here’s how our trip went:

# Day 1: Arrival & First Impressions

We landed at CDG airport around 19:30 after a long day of travel. We took the RER B into the city and transferred to our hotel in the 14th arrondissement – Hôtel Moderniste.

# Hotel Recommendation: Hôtel Moderniste

* **Absolutely fantastic!** I can’t find a single flaw.
* Impeccable hospitality, cleanliness, and service.
* Would highly recommend it!

I had planned our trip a month in advance, but just before leaving, I decided to focus more on enjoying Paris itself. My biggest tip? **Walk as much as you can!** The city is stunning everywhere you look. I downloaded several transport apps, but in the end, **Google Maps** was the easiest and most accurate for navigation.

# Day 2: Exploring the City

We started with a **free guided tour** in the Latin Quarter leading towards the Louvre. After that, we wandered around, stopping wherever we found something interesting.

We visited **Musée d'Orsay** (both of us are under 26 and from the EU, so we got in for free). The line looked long, but it moved very quickly – about a **10-minute wait**. The museum was incredible!

The weather was unpredictable—one moment it was windy, the next sunny, then rain. We stopped at a cute café for a break and also visited a bakery to try some pastries. The coffee wasn’t amazing, but it was decent.

In the evening, we picked up our things from the hotel (which was great for **storing luggage for free!**) and freshened up before heading to our **Louvre booking at 19:30**. Pro tip: Arrive **10-15 minutes later** than your scheduled time to avoid crowds and walk right in.

After the Louvre, we took **Metro 6** to the Eiffel Tower and had dinner at **Les Amours** – 10/10! No huge crowds, no reservation needed, and the food and service were excellent.

That night, we took the **bus instead of the metro**—a great way to see parts of the city you’d otherwise miss. Traffic wasn’t bad, and Paris is beautifully lit at night.

# Day 3: More Sightseeing

In the morning, we visited **Parc des Princes** (half by tram, half by bike). **I highly recommend using the city bikes**—they’re super easy to rent and give you a better feel for the city.

Next, we took the metro to **Montmartre**, explored, and then walked down to the **Luxembourg Gardens** (which were packed since it was a Saturday, but still breathtaking).

From there, we took the **bus to Pont Alexandre III**, had coffee in the city, and then headed for our **Seine River cruise at 20:00**.

⚠ **Heads up:** It gets **very cold** on the upper deck of the boat! The queue looked intimidating, but it moved quickly (about 30 minutes). It was nice, but honestly, **not as amazing as the hype** suggested.

After the cruise, we went to the **Eiffel Tower & Trocadéro**—WOW. Street musicians, live performances, a vibrant atmosphere—**one of the highlights of our trip!** We hadn’t planned this, but it turned out to be an amazing experience.

# Day 4: Versailles & Last Night in Paris

In the morning, we headed to **Versailles (13:00 booking)** via **RER C**. Again, we used **our EU under-26 free entry**.

📱 **Tip:** Download the official **Versailles app**—it helps you navigate the palace and learn about what you’re seeing.

Versailles is **possibly the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen**. Yes, it’s crowded, but since it’s massive, it doesn’t feel overwhelming.

After that, we went **shopping at Galeries Lafayette**, explored more of the city, and wrapped up our trip.

# The Final Night & Airport Journey

Our flight was at **6:00 AM from Beauvais Airport**, so we had to get to the **shuttle bus in Saint-Denis Université**.

🛑 **Important Warning!**

* We took the **last Metro 13** around **00:30** to reach the bus stop.
* Everything was fine **until the last station**, where we were left alone with some **sketchy guys**. The same thing happened outside the station, but police arrived, and they scattered. More people showed up soon after, and we felt safer.
* Line up for the shuttle **by 2:30 AM** to secure your spot. The bus filled up quickly and left earlier than scheduled!

# My Tips for Paris

* **Navigo Pass**: Get it **at the airport** or load it onto Apple Wallet—it’s the fastest and most convenient option.
* **Under-26 Free Entry**: We **got into everything for free** with our EU passports. If an attraction could be **booked online, we reserved it in advance**; otherwise, we just showed our passports at the entrance and walked right in!
* **Hotel Storage**: Our hotel stored our luggage **for free all day** on the last day. We even relaxed at the reception, charged our phones, and then headed to the airport.
* **Plan, but be flexible**: We often changed our route when we saw something interesting nearby, and it made the trip feel more spontaneous and enjoyable.
* **Paris is safe, but be cautious late at night**—especially if you're taking the last metro to a remote area.
* **McDonald's** was our go-to for quick, safe food. When choosing other restaurants, **check Google reviews** before walking in—you won’t go wrong!

💬 If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I’d love to help.

Ah! The good idea is to entrust the organization of the holidays to Joël. But what is the joke? I was caught up in this shipwreck, it was a foregone conclusion... it starts as soon as you get to your ""brilliant"" corner. No, not great, but GREAT! He had warned us, the access path is a little down there. He takes care of pushing Lucie's chair. Lucie tensing up to hold back. A wheelchair is rarely suitable for crossing a freshly plowed field, but it is a shortcut. Finally, the famous path is first found by smell. So no, it's not a little path that smells of hazelnuts, it's more of an open sewer. The path is a bit greasy. You speak! Don't panic, it's over there, he extends his arm, pointing in a direction between a parked white car and a large bush a little further away. A car, therefore, a road, at the very least a possibility of avoiding filling up the plowed field. I'm going to kill him. Yes, I. Go kill him.

The car is parked on the side of the road. No... A road, not one of those things made by gravelling a rotten path and brushing it with liquid tar, no! A very flat, very smooth road, made with asphalt. The holidays seem to be going well. We're going to postpone Joël's killing. We notice these two guys walking casually in the field, shirtless, a bath towel thrown over their shoulder. They go behind the bush. We talk to organize the rest of the course when the two guys come running back, Olympic champions to see their performance. Ah, just not motivated, the bear that follows them must have a pituitary problem, or else it has branched off on its evolutionary branch, it missed the elephant exit. Pierre has a start in front of the painting, a chance, and he opens the car door. Pierre and Joël rush in, I grab Lucie and throw her into the back seat. I lean against her and slam the door. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the two guys jumping over our shelter. The bear follows them, using the roof as a springboard, which brings the ceiling back to the level of the headrests. The side windows were blown out. The two windshields are; disguised as abstract stained glass windows. A huge flash of light, immediately followed by a riot of gunfire. We get out of the vehicle, what a wreck! The bear is sprawled on the ground, around fifty guys surround him, where did they come from? Ah, the athletes from earlier, they're talking, no, they're arguing.

— You closed the gate incorrectly.

-  No. I closed it well, I checked

-  Oh yes ? Why did they come back to life?

I stare at them, they change, they become smaller, little ones on stilts. Am I dreaming or do they have horns? No time to deepen a cry of horrified amazement 

— Damn my car!

A new character, tall, slender, pleasant face, blond with blue eyes, white teeth that could be used for toothpaste.

— Damn, were you the one who messed up my cash register?

— No, it’s the bear.

One of the goons on stilts calls out to him.

—Gabriel!

With a small gesture inviting you to come closer. A conversation in a low voice, and the name Gabriel approaches

—   Two years of vacation on Eden Island!

Let him take us out, handing us little cards. I looked down at the cardboard, like my companions, and when I looked up again, I was on a plank terrace, in a bed of tulips. Not alone, there is with us the crowd of bear hunters. They discuss in French, German, English, the discussions turn into shouting matches and degenerate into fights.

- Welcome !

I didn't see the guy coming. He is jovial, he grabs our cards.

— Ah, you are Gabriel’s guests

— Um, do you know him?

— Ugh, a rich kid who offers stays every time he's drunk.

 Take another look at the cards

—   Fuck two years!

Does he think he's Chirac's puppet? The fight behind doesn't calm down, a guy thrown at Lucie grabs her dress, a light fabric, and Joël's sister finds herself naked. Joel is indignant

—You could have worn a swimsuit, right?

— Me, I had to enjoy the sun! Hey! Did you see?

She looks down her body while presenting it to us, her hands at hip level. Note from Pierre.

- What, do you have a full pussy?

—  But he’s stupid, I’m standing, I’m walking. And…

She is interrupted by a slap on the buttocks. She turns around with a big smile

—  That's nice, it's been two years since someone last put a hand on my ass.

The guy, at first surprised, breaks into a big smile. Smile replaced by a grimace of pain when she shoots his crotch.

— That's just for your education.

We find ourselves on the road, next to “Gabriel’s” car. Well, this morning, we didn't smoke anything. What was in the coffee? That it leaves two years of memories? The guy who comes in cool, springy walk, tanned, blonde hair... Shit!  The Gabriel of my “dream”. He gets in his car and drives off. We look at each other uncertainly. Lucie grabs the bottom of her dress and lifts it up to her chin. It presents a naked body, but golden like a loaf of bread coming out of the oven. She lets her clothing fall. We didn't dream.

— Ben you’re still up.

— Fuck!",2,1743584536.0,HFY,0,1.0,False

1jpk4cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AISEOInsider/comments/1jpk4cy/amazon_nova_act_beats_claude_gpt_on_browser_tasks/,Amazon Nova Act Beats Claude & GPT On Browser Tasks (With Proof),"Do you know what the difference is between the AI tools we have now and the AI tools coming tomorrow?

Today's AI can tell you about the weather. Tomorrow's AI will pack your umbrella.

**Watch the video tutorial below.**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-nZNUiUOBs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-nZNUiUOBs)

Amazon just dropped a game-changing AI that does exactly that – and nobody seems to be talking about it yet.

I just discovered Amazon Nova Act hours after its announcement, and the benchmark results are shocking: it's outperforming Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT.

This isn't just another AI model – it's a completely different approach that could change how we interact with technology forever.

# The Amazon Nova Act Breakthrough Nobody Saw Coming

Amazon Nova Act isn't just another chatbot. It's an AI model specifically trained to perform real-world actions within your web browser.

While everyone's been focused on text generation and image creation, Amazon quietly developed an AI that can:

* Click buttons
* Fill out forms
* Navigate websites
* Make selections
* Complete transactions

And it's doing it better than any other AI on the market right now.

The most jaw-dropping part? The benchmark results. On the screen spot web text test (following natural language instructions), Amazon Nova Act scored 0.939 compared to Claude 3.7 Sonnet's 0.900 and OpenAI's 0.883.

For screen spot web icon tests, the gap is even bigger.

This isn't just an incremental improvement – it's a leap forward.

# Real-World Tasks Amazon Nova Act Can Handle Today

Here's what Amazon Nova Act can actually do right now:

It can order food delivery for you. In the demo, it navigates to Sweetgreen, selects delivery, chooses menu items, and even sets a 20% tip – all automatically.

It can search for a coffee maker on Amazon, select the first result, scroll down, and add it to your cart without you touching a thing.

It can find your recent order from a restaurant and reorder it with a simple command.

It can search for hotels in a specific city between certain dates, sort by reviews, and start the booking process.

And maybe most impressive of all – it can handle CAPTCHAs, the very things designed to stop bots.

This isn't science fiction or a tech demo. This is working technology available right now.

# How To Access Amazon Nova Act Right Now

Amazon Nova Act is currently only available to customers in the US via Nova.amazon.com.

For developers, there's a GitHub repository with all the documentation you need to start building with the Amazon Nova Act SDK.

The process is straightforward:

1. Visit [Nova.amazon.com](http://Nova.amazon.com) (US only for now)
2. Get your API key
3. Export it in your terminal
4. Install the necessary packages
5. Start creating browser automation scripts

Even the GitHub repository includes ready-to-use examples like ordering a coffee maker or finding hotels.

# What This Means For The Future Of AI

I believe we're at a pivotal moment in AI development. What Amazon Nova Act represents isn't just a new tool – it's a shift in what AI can actually do for us.

Within 6-12 months, I expect these capabilities to be everywhere. Imagine:

* Telling your virtual assistant to ""renew my car registration"" and having it complete the entire process online
* Having AI research, compare, and purchase the best flight deals for your vacation
* Automating your entire online shopping process with simple voice commands

The line between what requires human action and what doesn't is about to shift dramatically.

# How Businesses Should Prepare For Amazon Nova Act

If you run a business, this technology should be on your radar for several reasons:

1. Customer service automation will reach new levels
2. Operational tasks can be automated far beyond what's currently possible
3. Early adopters will gain significant competitive advantages
4. New business models will emerge around this technology

The businesses that adapt quickly will have a major edge over those that don't.

That's why I'm helping businesses prepare for this AI revolution in my AI Profit Boardroom.

Inside, you'll get:

* Weekly mastermind calls with direct support
* Automation templates ready to implement
* Real-world case studies of successful AI implementation
* A new AI course every month

# Amazon's Tactical Play In The AI Race

Make no mistake – this move by Amazon is strategic. By focusing on action-oriented AI that can complete real-world tasks, they're carving out a unique position in the AI landscape.

While other companies focus on text and image generation, Amazon is building AI that can actually do things for you.

And it makes perfect business sense for them too – an AI that can shop for you fits perfectly into Amazon's ecosystem.

I predict we'll see rapid integration with other Amazon services, especially voice assistants like Alexa. ""Alexa, order my weekly groceries"" could soon be completely automated end-to-end.

# The Developer Opportunity Is Massive

For developers, Amazon Nova Act represents a huge opportunity. Amazon is clearly focusing on getting developers on board first by releasing the SDK early.

They're hoping to create an ecosystem of apps and extensions built around the Nova Act API.

If you're a developer, getting in early could position you at the forefront of a whole new category of AI-powered apps.

Even if you're not technical, understanding what's possible will help you identify business opportunities nobody else sees yet.

# My Prediction: Amazon Nova Act Will Change How We Work

I believe Amazon Nova Act and similar technologies will fundamentally change how we interact with computers and the internet.

Tasks that currently take minutes or hours of manual clicking and typing will be automated away.

This won't just save time – it will change what types of work humans need to do. The value of being able to operate a computer interface will decrease, while the value of deciding what needs to be done will increase.

Quality control will become more important than ever. Making sure your AI agents are performing correctly will be a critical skill.

# Why You Need To Start Preparing Now

The time to start thinking about how AI agents will impact your work and business is now, not when they're already mainstream.

That's why I've built resources to help you stay ahead of the curve:

**Have you ever felt like your to-do list was out to get you?** Like, no matter how many fancy calendars or strategic apps you try, your tasks somehow *multiply* like… rabbits? 🐇

I feel you. **Time blocking** was my go-to hack for a hot minute. *Until,* well, it wasn’t. There I was, proudly mapping out every. single. hour. of my day, only to *crash and burn* by lunchtime! Instead of conquering tasks, they conquered me. 😅

Sound familiar? Don’t worry—I was right there with you, until I discovered the *game-changing* 10-minute twist that saved me 10 HOURS a week! **Seriously!**

**So what’s the secret sauce?**

1. **Set a 10-minute timer:** Sounds silly, right? But bear with me. It's all about tricking yourself into starting. Even the scariest tasks seem manageable when you're just committing to 10 minutes.

2. **Pick ONE task only:** No multitasking madness aloud. Focus on that one task and watch how much clearer and calmer your headspace becomes. *What’s more productive than a chaos-free mind?*

3. **Power boost breaks:** After each 10-minute segment, allow yourself a quick break. Dance it out, pet your dog, grab a coffee—whatever recharges you! 🔋

4. **Stack it up!** If you’re on a roll, do another 10 minutes. Keep stacking until you feel like you've tamed the task beast!

Here’s a personal gem: I used to dread emails. They were my nemesis. 😤 But tackling them in bite-size, 10-minute sessions made them far less intimidating and *way* more manageable.

**Why does this work better than classic time blocking?**

- **Less pressure:** A day full of blocked squares can feel like a prison sentence. 🙄

- **Flexibility rules:** Life is messy, and this method lets you pivot and adapt without feeling like a failure.

- **Momentum magic:** Once you start, it’s easier to keep going. Who knew a tiny 10-minute leap could start an avalanche of productivity?

This isn’t just about doing more—it's about *feeling* better about what you're doing. After giving the 10-minute method a real whirl, I found I was not only more productive, but *way* happier too. And that’s priceless, right?

✨ I’d love to hear what you think—is this tweak something you're planning to try out in your own routine chaos? Let's keep the convo going and share what works for our unique, glorious, messy lives! 🌈

## Key Considerations Before You Buy: Finding the Perfect Fit

Choosing the right **sleeper sofas for small spaces** requires careful consideration. Here are some crucial factors to keep in mind:

*   **Size and Dimensions:** This is paramount. Measure your available space meticulously,taking into account both the sofa's dimensions when closed and when fully extended as a bed. Pay close attention to depth, width, and height to ensure a comfortable fit. Consider whether a **narrow sleeper sofa** is the best option for particularly tight spaces. For corner spaces, a **sleeper sectional small space** might prove ideal.*   **Sofa bed size:** Sleeper sofas come in various sizes, including twin, full, and queen. Choose a size that comfortably accommodates your guests without overwhelming the room. A **twin sleeper sofa** is a good choice for single sleepers or children, while a **queen sleeper sofa small space** offers more room for couples. A **full size sleeper sofa small space** provides a nice middle ground.

I have made a couple of friends and have gotten a few advice from them about restaurants and street food places but that doesn't cut it for me. Hence, I am here seeking advice and suggestions from the diverse people of this subreddit and hoping in the process, I will get to know/learn about a place or area that I haven't so far. 

I work around the Minto Park area and live in the Park Street Area. I definitely do not want the overpriced overhyped bars and restaurants around the place I live. As to what I want to do, I love cafes. Expensive, non-expensive, it doesn't matter as long as their coffee tastes good. I like simple walks around parks, scenic places, or quiet areas (something like Southern Avenue, for example). I love reading, philosophy, community clubs, cinema, artsy activities (pottery, painting, etc.), sucker for museum, historical places, aaaand that's about it? (I think). I mostly explore/travel alone, but don't mind group activities (as long as it isn't crowded with 5+ people). 

Apart from suggestions of places, I would also need your help in understanding what people ""do"". How do I make new friends/ Meet new people here? What are some of the cultural events that may take place soon? What are some of the groups / online circles that are pretty ""happening""? 

Oh, and one last thing, I don't mind travelling as long as the place is connected via metro or has a metro within a 3 km radius. For somewhat short distances (5 to 18 km), I would much rather just book cabs or Uber ride share. It might be stupid, but I just cannot trust the private buses that I see on the street.

1jpjoal,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jpjoal/i_think_im_being_stalked/,I think IM being stalked?,"Has anyone here ever dealt with being stalked? Because I think I might be in that situation, and I honestly don’t know what to do or how to handle it.

It started last year, and at first, I didn’t think much of it. This guy began showing up everywhere I went, but I chalked it up to coincidence. You know, running into the same person at the grocery store, on the bus, or at a coffee shop isn’t that unusual. People have routines; it happens. But after a while, it started feeling less random and way too frequent. I’d grab coffee, and he’d be there. I’d go for a walk in the park, and he’d show up. Even when I’m just walking home, I’d see him nearby, like he’s always lingering, watching. It’s unsettling, to say the least.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to avoid him. I’ve changed my routines completely—going to different coffee shops, taking different routes home, even skipping plans I was looking forward to because I didn’t want to risk running into him. Yet, somehow, he always seems to find me. It’s like he knows where I’ll be, no matter how much I try to shake him off. I don’t know how he’s doing it, and honestly, that’s part of what scares me. Is he following me without me noticing? Does he know something about my schedule that I don’t realize I’m giving away? I feel like I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, and it’s exhausting.

The worst part is, I don’t even know if I’m overreacting. I keep questioning myself: Am I just being paranoid? Is this all just some weird series of coincidences? But then my gut kicks in, and it’s screaming at me that something isn’t right. I’ve always been the kind of person who trusts their instincts, and right now, my instincts are telling me to be careful. Still, I feel stuck because I don’t know what the right move is.

Should I confront him? Part of me wants to just walk up to him and ask why he’s always around, but I’m scared that could escalate things or make him angry. What if he denies everything and I end up feeling even more trapped? On the other hand, I’ve thought about going to the police, but I worry they won’t take me seriously. What if they just brush it off as me being paranoid because I don’t have any solid evidence? I don’t want to make things worse, but I also can’t keep living like this—constantly anxious, constantly afraid.

I’ve been reading about stalking online, and it seems like there are so many different ways people handle it. Some recommend documenting everything—dates, times, places—but I don’t even know where to start. Others say to tell friends and family, but I feel embarrassed to bring it up. What if they think I’m imagining it? I’ve kept this mostly to myself because I don’t want people to think I’m being dramatic, but honestly, I feel like I’m at my breaking point.

If anyone here has been through something similar or has any advice, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts. What did you do? Did it help? How do you even begin to deal with something like this? Just something that can help me.

We have a four year old son and three months ago I gave birth to twins. It was a high risk pregnancy and I developed a condition that threatened their lives while still in the womb. Ended up having a surgery. Thank goodness, I now have two beautiful, healthy girls. 

My husband isn’t hands on and is overwhelmed with the babies. We’ve discussed this at length and I’ve had to accept that I simply won’t get the help I need from him, he doesn’t have the tools in the toolbox for many reasons (which I’m processing myself through therapy). He said once they reach six months old he’ll be more invested. 

One of the way his overwhelm presents itself recently is his anger. He goes from 0-100 over such small things and this is negatively impacting me and my kids. Especially when he shouts. 

I’ve begged and begged for couples therapy but he’s not open to it at all. The issue is I have so much resentment building up in me that I’m finding it very hard to move forward. When he then loses his temper or gets angry with me, I feel like I’m withdrawing from him even more. Added to this, my mother has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. I’m feeling very overwhelmed myself and his meanness/anger makes me feel unsupported.

He keeps telling me to move on after an incident, but I have tried to explain that unless there is a change in his behaviour or actions to break the pattern, I can’t move on. 

Things he’s lost his temper over or unkind things he’s said over the last few weeks:

- Being woken up to help me take care of our three kids in the morning and losing his temper because he needs 15 minutes to wake up alone before he can help (I wake up everyday to take care of the kids - no lie in for me)
- Told me he’d rather let the marriage end than go to couples therapy

- Told me not everyone needs therapy, he’s one of those people. Told me to focus on my own therapy to ‘fix my issues’

- Went to bed late after dinner with friends, shouted at my son and I the next morning for waking him up - told my son to get changed out of his leggings because ‘they’re for girls’
 
- Locked the bedroom door and shouted at me this morning after I went downstairs to get coffee for us because he was naked under the covers and I left the door open (we had people in the house - they were downstairs too)

AIO for thinking until he takes accountability and addresses his anger it’s impossible for us to move on?

I'm the only one who drinks coffee in the house - maybe 2 or 3 cups a day. I used to hand grind but wanted the convenience of electric. With all the retention management on the Opus, the end to end grinding process is longer than manual. I definitely have the option of putting up with the Opus, but it's not a fun part of my day.

These compact devices provide easy access to clean and filtered drinking water without requiring extensive installation or plumbing modifications. With the increasing emphasis on health and hydration, countertop water dispensers offer a practical and efficient way to ensure that fresh water is always available. Their sleek design and functionality make them a great choice for those looking to optimize their kitchen or office space while staying hydrated throughout the day.

One of the primary advantages of countertop water dispensers is their compact and portable design. Unlike bulky free-standing dispensers, these units fit neatly on kitchen counters, office desks, or break room tables, making them ideal for small spaces. They are easy to set up and require minimal maintenance, which is especially beneficial for busy households and workplaces. Many models are designed to be compatible with standard water bottles or direct filtration systems, offering flexibility in water supply options. This convenience makes countertop water dispensers a valuable addition to any setting where space is limited but clean water is essential. **For more:** [**Countertop Water Dispenser**](https://www.haibowater.com/countertop-water-dispenser)

Another major benefit of countertop water dispensers is their ability to provide purified and temperature-controlled water. Many models come equipped with built-in filtration systems that remove contaminants such as chlorine, bacteria, and heavy metals, ensuring safe and great-tasting drinking water. Additionally, these dispensers often offer multiple temperature settings, including hot, cold, and room temperature options. This makes them highly versatile, catering to various needs such as preparing tea, coffee, or refreshing cold drinks. The ability to access clean, filtered water at the desired temperature enhances both convenience and health benefits for users.

Countertop water dispensers also contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing the need for single-use plastic bottles. By using a dispenser, households and businesses can minimize their reliance on bottled water, thereby decreasing plastic waste and promoting eco-friendly consumption habits. Many modern dispensers are also designed with energy-efficient features that help reduce electricity consumption, making them a sustainable choice for conscious consumers. Investing in a countertop water dispenser is not only beneficial for health and convenience but also supports global efforts to reduce plastic pollution and energy waste.

In conclusion, countertop water dispensers are a practical and efficient solution for ensuring access to clean and filtered water in homes and workplaces. Their compact design, advanced filtration capabilities, and temperature control features make them a valuable addition to any space. Moreover, their environmental benefits align with sustainable living practices, making them an excellent choice for those looking to reduce plastic waste and energy consumption. As hydration remains a top priority for health-conscious individuals, the demand for countertop water dispensers continues to rise, reinforcing their importance in modern living and working environments.

I slept at 6am, woke up at 10am and he was unlike himself. I knew he was not ok. I took him to the vet and 10 hours later he passed away. I was with him and I told him what a good boy he always was and how much I loved him. 

They don’t know what went wrong. 
I am confused and in so much pain. I don’t understand, he was completely fine!!! I’m so sad for all the years we will not have together, he truly was one of a kind. 

We would call him our little puppy because he acted like one. As soon as anyone would walk through the door, no matter who, he’d throw himself at their feet and ask them for belly rubs. 
He loved massages, from my husband and preferred his beard to an actual hairbrush. 😅
He came with us almost every time we would go out (non-work related). 
He always slept next to me or on me. 
And he was the most trainable cat I’d ever met! His favourite game was fetch. 

He was my puppycat. I hope he knew just how much I loved him.

But no. I overslept (10 hours sleep disturbed by my ""emergency"" alarm), got a coffee, breakfast (cause the pill..) and started to work. 

No. Not at all. My Brain is foggy. 

I did The Work for about a hour. No results. 

I do it for so many hour, that my rate will be like $1/hour.... 🤦🤦

So I went to rest to the bed with a book.. Nope. Still foggy. 

Cant go outside, waiting for a courier and I really wnat to finish before I move... 
What do YOU  do with this utter shit? 😭

My go to activities that usualy dont help at all (except Ritallin, that usualy works but not Today) 

1) Drink water 
2) Protein - food
3) Medication
4) Break
5) Go outside

Current break is anyhow just ""not working but thinking about it with regrets"" 🙄🤦",1,1743581679.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
