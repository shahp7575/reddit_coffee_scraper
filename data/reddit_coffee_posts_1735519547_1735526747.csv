For those of yous about to get out, or recently out (and anyone else out). (Current executive in a large service industry with 5,000 employees. I didn’t finish college and started at the very fucking bottom and worked my way up. So, I know a thing or two and want to help, legitimately). 


Get yourself some good shirt stays. Pictured above. These cost $11.75 on Amazon Prime with two day delivery. They’re nice, go over the toe and under the sock, so no nasty nut schalpping surprise. Most importantly you look squared away. 

Attach those shirt stays to a nice shirt. Wear a nice pair of trousers. Match your belt color to your shoes.   White under shirts, ONLY. I’m telling you, a nice crisp professional look will get you past 95% of applicants these days. You won’t believe the shit I see come into one of my branches for an interview. Anyone in a nice shirt and trousers is going to catch hiring managers’ eyes. 

In fact, go to JC Penny’s, Macy’s or even Men’s Warehouse. Get two to three shirts. (Plain either white or light blue), and two pairs of trousers (one blue l, one black, both tailored). It may cost a little money up front but will pay dividends in the future. Trust me, invest in yourself. 

If you can afford a tailored suit, even better. But, not necessary. I’d rather see you in a well fitted shirt and trousers and a cheap AF and ill-fitting suit. It demonstrates self-awareness and social awareness, too. Ties are great. Don’t get a silk tie for god-sake! You’re not a cheap ass pimp. 

Most of the people your age come in looking like shit, like they don’t care, or dressed in street clothes that look like shit but cost their parents’ entire government check for the month. Stand out. 

Shave. Mother fucking shave. 

If you can’t, clean beard. No one is going to want to hire Ragnar Lothbrok outside of very few employers. 

Almost forgot, don’t wear white socks. Moving on…

Tone it down. I’ve seen so many veterans (especially POGs) ramp up the military jargon and “attitude “. Lots of “check”, “tracking”, “roger”, “Oscar Mike”, “send it”, etc., combined with an annoying ass alpha dog military manner. 

Civilians don’t know what the hell you’re saying and are weirded out by it. Us veterans, just think you’re gay. And not the good gay.

Just come in with your Sunday School professionalism. Be relaxed. Talk like a human being, and throw in some “Yes, Sir’s” “Yes, Ma’am’s”. 

Don’t be cocky. They’ll say they care, but no one cares that you are a Marine, beyond the thought that you’ll work hard and be responsible. 

Brush your fangs! Especially you gotdanged smokers and coffee drinkers. Bring some chewing gum too. 

After your interview, if not offered a job on the spot, follow up. Many hiring managers deal with hundreds of applicants. Drop and email or quick call and thank them for their time. 

Get a professional email. Gmail is great. Pussyslayer2002@yahoo.com will get ignored. Just some version of your name @ gmail is good. Proton is another good service. I guess yahoo is okay if you’re a fucking boomer. Hotmail is a no no. Ghetto AF. 

Once you land your job, be appreciative. It may not be your dream job, but stability, hard work and a little something extra will take you a long way and breed prosperity. Job hopping looks bad on a resume. And you tend to have to start at the bottom all over again. 

Once I stopped job hopping I went from $11.71 per hour to over $100k a year salaried with a 20% performance bonus in less than 10 years. You have to grind. 

Finally, remember, you’re a Marine. That means you hold the reputation of every Marine past, present and future on your shoulders. Act like it.

Supplemental:

Get a mentor in the civilian world. 

Ask vets who are out and successful about their journey. Emulate them. 

If at all possible, LEARN TO WRITE. I took a technical and creative writing course and it served me exceptionally well. 

Learn smartsheet, excel, word, google sheets, etc. 
Have someone review your resume. 

And if anyone here needs any of that help, feel free to DM me. I’m happy to help any young Marine in any way I can. I’ve made a ton of mistakes and have things to teach about what not to do.

1hpcvdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1hpcvdw/my_wife_makes_me_feel_unappreciated/,My wife makes me feel unappreciated,"My wife (33) and I (35) have an 11-month-old little boy. It is not easy at home, we are a bit alone without family support. Lately, I increasingly feel like I am not living up to my wife's expectations. We do not talk much, there is little enthusiasm, few or no sweet words. I receive more criticism about how I do certain things wrong or not well enough than compliments.

Yet, I do my best to make our life easier. I believe I do more than the vast majority of partners. Planning groceries, going grocery shopping, planning meals, cooking (coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and other teas), doing the dishes, putting away the dishes, serving meals, vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the carpet, dusting, scrubbing the shower, cleaning the toilet, washing clothes, folding and putting them away, taking out the trash, taking out the recycling, maintaining the kitchen, making the bed, changing the cats' litter, managing our finances and investments, doing our taxes. She might do one or two things of this list from time to time, but I do them on a daily basis.

We share responsibilities about 50/50 when it comes to our son. For several months, I exclusively took care of him at night so my wife could rest. I sleep in the living room, sometimes only 4 non-consecutive hours. I do not have time to nap. No more sports or exercise. No time for entertainment either. I help with diaper changes, bottles, baths, I play with him, rock him, take him outside in the stroller or baby carrier. I try to be present and involved. I make sure exclusively that my wife's breast pump is always ready to use. Cleaning, sterilizing, drying, and storing the breast pump, other bottles, and baby equipment is primarily me too.

I bring in about 70% of the household income and I do not mind. I am passionate about my work and ambitious. I work from home, so I can see my boy grow up. The days feel very long as I go from night/morning baby duty to work with barely seconds in between, sometimes. The frequent context switches affect my concentration and productivity. I am the only one who can drive, so whenever there is an in-person appointment, I have to take time off. If my wife needs to go out alone or make an important call, I have to take time off work as well to watch after our baby. Some weeks, I can only work a few half-days.

More than ten years ago, our sex life was quite active and varied. Today, I would describe it as rare and bland. Maybe once every month or two. Always the same things. I do not feel desired at all. I still desire her and make sure she knows it.

I can sometimes be unpleasant, after all, I am not always in a good mood. I have to manage the stress of being a new parent at home and the stress and expectations of work. She is on parental leave and is often exhausted due to lack of physical fitness, milk production, and other health issues.

1hpcv0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTransGirls/comments/1hpcv0e/chasers_who_lovebomb_and_the_curse_of_passing/,"chasers who lovebomb and the ""curse"" of passing","have you ever out with a guy who treats you like a queen, free drinks, introduces you to his friends, hand holding, most romantic night of your life, dancing in the middle of the street, endless giggles? then in bed they want your dick? i've had two of those. my theory is these men are the loneliest most insecure kind of man. they project lots of confidence because they know you're weak and need some kind of sense and hope for love. they shower you in compliments. what gives them confidence? being with many girls at once. they date all kinds of girls, all weights, races because they want to feel wanted. and when they're with a hot passing trans girl they know they won because they can be in public with you acting all in love and then in the bedroom they think they are kings and you're subservient to their deepest fetishes just because you're trans.  the first guy i ever liked would spit in my mouth and choked me until i had a bruise on my neck because i lacked that much confidence. and then he would give me princess treatment. what else? we trans girls are the easiest to ghost. that's the last step.

is stealth better? only if you're confident. being stealth made me realize cis girls go through so much shit. being a stealth pre-op girl i've gotten sexually harassed on dates, sometimes i still have guys treat me like crap because i'm so insecure. i will never forget when i was on this stealth date with a handsome fit guy who earned 80k a year and i thought i was finally being treated seriously and then he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick. i yelled, what are you doing?? and he accused me of making the entire thing up. lol.

when you're a pretty trans girl, the men can't be transphobic to you. it's been so long since anyone called me a slur. but, today alone the guy who was asking me out found out im trans and instead of simply blocking me he made a deeply disgusting sexual remark that he wouldve never said to a cis girl. but even in his transphobia he couldn't deny sexualizing me.

i thought sex and sexuality would be liberaring when i was younger and impressionable. sometimes, it can be fun, i havent paid for a drink on a date in many months, i get guys to pay me ubers, etc etc. but it also opens the door for the type of disrespect that we young impressionable women don't know how to indentify at first. a guy forcing himself on you just because he got you a drink is still predatory. a guy who is begging you to go to his hotel when you said no is still disrespectful, there's nothing attractive about begging a woman for sex. and lastly, the ""respectful"" chaser who wants to look but not touch is still a fetishist.

i don't actually think passing is a curse, it saved my life, i admit it. but it opened up some new ways of being disrespected. i began dating in 2024, and i'm leaving this year disappointed, traumatized and still deeply oversexualized even by guys i went on innocent coffee dates with who think i'm cis. 

being trans is being an image, you go from the ugly duckling to a unique stunning woman. you appreciate attention but unfortunately disrespect seeps in with that attention because the attention is sudden instead of gradual like with cis women.

one of my acquaintances is a non passing trans woman, sometimes i'm deeply jealous of her. she has a giant friend group, she probably likes her own dick lol, she lives her life like she's got nothing to lose. i'm in my barbie stealth girl bag and i can count respectful men only on one hand, my cis girlfriend is jealous of me and i still can't find the confidence in me to not let men walk all over me sometimes. but hey, one day.

1hpcs2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialFiction/comments/1hpcs2d/whiskers/,Whiskers,"It was the last thing Margaret expected to see in the core of Jupiter—a single, wiry feline whisker floating in the viscous, impossible atmosphere of metallic hydrogen. She didn’t dare touch it, though every instinct in her human mind screamed to pluck it from its hovering position and inspect its mystery.

The others were silent. Jacob, their mission lead, stared at the whisker like it might detonate. Dr. Lin bit her lip, muttering equations about gravitational anomalies under her breath. Even Ahmed, usually the loudest voice in their debates over the ethics of drilling into the gas giant's heart, stood frozen.

“Is it... moving?” Margaret ventured, breaking the oppressive stillness.

It was.

Not in the linear, predictable way objects obeying physics should move. No, the whisker pulsed, twitching as though it belonged to something alive. But that was preposterous. Nothing should live here—not with pressure strong enough to crush titanium, temperatures hot enough to liquefy dreams.

“I think it sees us,” Ahmed said at last, his voice hollow.

“Whiskers don’t see,” Jacob snapped, though his tone wavered. He was lying—to himself as much as to them.

Margaret stepped back instinctively, her boot sliding against the metallic platform they had deployed. They were miles deep into the Jovian abyss, their ship tethered to an experimental bore rig—an absurd contraption that pierced clouds of helium and hydrogen like an interstellar corkscrew. What had started as a routine probe to harvest data had spiraled into madness when they’d struck something solid in the supposedly molten center.

The whisker wasn’t alone anymore.

Around it, faint shapes began to emerge in the shimmering fluid—a web of lines, forming and unforming. No, not lines. Tails? Tentacles? Each carried the same texture, faint and feline, as though the universe had doodled a cat onto the fabric of reality and erased most of it, leaving smudges of surreal possibility.

“I vote we abort,” Dr. Lin said, her voice trembling.

“Too late,” Jacob said, his voice cracking. “It knows we’re here.”

“It?” Margaret turned to him, but Jacob wasn’t looking at the whisker anymore. His eyes were locked on something behind her. Something huge. Something breathing.

She turned. And there it was.

The entity defied logic. It was cat-like only in the vaguest of senses—if a cat were stretched through dimensions, warped by gravitational tides and folded into a shape the mind struggled to parse. Its fur shimmered like crushed opals under invisible starlight, its eyes were twin eclipses, and its mouth...

“Did it just smile?” Ahmed whispered.

The thing purred. No, the sound was deeper, resonating through the bones of the ship and into their skulls. Margaret clutched her helmet, trying to shake the vibration loose, but it wasn’t just sound—it was language.

“Stay.”

The word rippled through them, bypassing their ears, their translators, even their brains. It burrowed straight into their spines, planting a singular command.

“Stay where?” Margaret demanded, her voice thin against the Jovian din.

The entity moved—or rather, reality warped around it. One moment, it was meters away; the next, it loomed so close she could see the fractal infinity swirling in its fur. She wanted to scream, to run, but her body refused to obey.

“Margaret,” Jacob said. “You’re... changing.”

She looked down. Her hands had begun to blur, edges smudging as though rendered in soft charcoal. Panic rose, but so did something else—a warmth, a pull, like she was meant to dissolve into whatever this creature was.

“Leave her alone!” Ahmed lunged, but the moment he touched Margaret, his hand fused into hers. They both cried out as the purring escalated, now a torrent of words neither could comprehend. The creature’s smile grew, its mouth unfurling in impossible ways.

“Together.”

“What do you want?” Dr. Lin shrieked, clawing at the controls. “We’re just scientists! We—”

The creature didn’t wait. It surged forward, a tidal wave of limbs and whispers, swallowing them whole.

For a moment, there was nothing.

And then, a room. Simple, Earth-like. A coffee machine gurgled in the corner. Papers lay scattered on a table.

Margaret sat up, blinking. “What the...?”

The others were there, too, intact. No signs of the creature. No sign of Jupiter.

But the whisker? It was on the table, still twitching. And next to it, a note:

Last year we stayed at Finest DR. We loved food quality, service, coffee bar, silent disco. Our oldest loved the silly night club on site.

We’d love to keep all of the things above but have a nicer beach. The boys still like things like water slides but we don’t want to be surrounded by Littles.

Flexible on location. We like upscale but not uber fancy. Must have great food. Would rather stay at a midsize rather than mega resort but open if something hits all the right notes.

I have to assume she thought it was empty...but I have to say in all my years of doing dishes, this one hasn't come up lol.

She put those little fabric softener balls in the dryer. I mean what would dry heat do to little balls of fabric softener other than bake them onto the damn dryer wall?

She once put pizza rolls in the microwave for 10 minutes...like almost caused a fire. I ate pizza rolls my whole childhood and have never done anything close to that. Just yesterday she put room temp food in the microwave for 5 minutes...I was just glad I was there to say it does not require that much time. This is her and my partner's first gas stove and needless to say, it makes me nervous.


She seems clueless and typically doesn't seem like she has common sense at times. I don't actually remember how I was at 19, I was probably too busy trying to survive. So I am thinking maybe I was also an idiot, just not to the same magnitudes. But she doesn't have a particularly stressful life: she works part time, put off college until next semester as a new HS grad, and the only chore she has is the dishes. This isn't causing any relationship problems with myself and her, I've just lowered my expectations for her honestly. And maybe become a bit worried about our overall safety.

But now I am wondering if this is normal or if this is a type of parenting I should be concerned about with my partner. I do worry that my partner babies her too much and doesn't allow her to grow up. Sometimes she does behave like a 12 year old (baby talk, wants simple or easy things done for her, doesn't take initiative to clean around the house). She seems a little slow for her age. Feel free to give some anecdotes about your own teens.

TLDR: Is me thinking she should be a little more...thoughtful...too high of an expectation for her as a teen?",0,1735525797.0,relationship_advice,8,0.5,False

More tests are needed above ground for excess radiation.” A loudspeaker fills the bunker with its booming robotic voice

“Bullshit” 

October 19th, 2025, 8:00 am

A man and his family were the last ones to enter the safety of the Buffalo, New York bunker. They had planned on leaving much earlier, but when you have two young children nothing goes according to plan. Making the final turn into their suburban neighborhood one word passes through the two parents' minds “Finally”. As they drive into the driveway of their home, the father is careful to make the parking as soft and quiet as possible to not wake his kids. The car stops with a subtle squeak of the breaks, the mother looks back at the kids, still sound asleep.

They both look at each other and smile, getting out of the car each one unbuckles and picks up a child. Both are still sound asleep, all the excitement of the past 20 hours has worn them out. Walking up to their house, it looks like a stereotypical icon of middle-class living. Perfectly preserved and updated 19th-century home just off the border with Canada. Having everything parents of two could ask for. Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a basement. 

Upon unlocking the front door, with his daughter still in his arms asleep. Open the door, the windows covered with blankets just in case they break because of The Storm. Thankfully so far nothing seems broken. Both Parents walk upstairs and put their children to bed. Walking downstairs not saying a word to not wake the sleeping kids. The father gestures over to start taking the blankets off the windows to let light in. 

The final touches of the living room are complete, both parents are satisfied that the room doesn't look like a Tasmanian Devil came in and tore up the place, they decide to go and make breakfast. 

“Still don’t understand why we had to stay in the shelter for so long, I don’t buy the “radiation” nonsense,” the father says as he grabs eggs from the fridge.

“Now John, they are the professionals. What they said goes. I mean, it’s better to be sure than sending people outside and getting radiation sickness or something.” “I mean, do you want Sally to grow another arm? She is Six and already a handful with two,” the mother points out, heating a pan on the gas stove. 

Handing her the eggs and bacon, “You’re probably right Susan, I still have imprints from George holding on to me when the actual Storm hit, he was shaking like a leaf.” John says, giving a little chuckle. 

“I saw that. Sally was surprisingly calm, I think I heard her whispering the “Wheels on the Bus” song to herself, I started to go along with her and it calmed my nerves surprisingly.” “Wanna turn the TV on and see what the news is saying? It’s a little past eight o’clock”

“Sure, didn't they say the news channels were the first to cover the aftermath?” He questions

“I believe so, yes. We might as well see what they have to say” Susan says. John kisses his wife on the cheek and goes to find the kitchen TV remote, which is in the junk drawer. Pointing it to the wall-mounted TV and pressing the power. Changing the channel to “Buffalo Channel 7 News” which was just starting

8:25 am

“Good Morning Buffalo!” The TV bursts out at almost full volume. John frantically turns it down so as to not wake up the kids. A man and woman anchor show up on the screen. “I’m Jim” “And I’m Jennifer and this is Channel 7 for Buffalo”

The camera pans over to the anchorman, he's wearing a black suit and tie combo. He has his iconic million-dollar smile showing his bright white teeth. “If you are seeing this now, that means that you were one of the first lucky few residents of Buffalo to get out of the shelter and beat the traffic, and I have to say ‘Congrats’.”

John, looking up at the TV screen sipping his coffee, was not too impressed with the remark “Jackass”

“Language” Susan gives him a gentle jab, “George and Sally will hear you”

“Sorry” 

The camera pans over to the Anchorwoman, clearly not too impressed with the remark but has to remain professional “Yes, our on-the-ground reporters will take it from here” The picture changes to a scene of a reporter on the side of a major road. “Can you hear us, Audry?”

There is a small delay before the reporter replies “I can hear you loud and clear Jennifer!” She has to speak up with the cars passing by slowly. “We are here on Humboldt Parkway right next to the Main Street bridge that crosses over Scajaquada Expressway!” “As you can see!” The camera pans to the main roads, it’s hectic. “There is bumper-to-bumper traffic going both ways, it is at a standstill! Reports of multiple accidents on the roads! Police are working very much overtime here Jennifer! No reports of any fatalities so far! We have been getting a few reports of loved ones not being able to get in contact with relatives who live just beyond the Canadian-American border, but we believe that it is very likely because of The Storm!” The camera pans up toward the sky, news choppers fly overhead. Like bees. 

“It looks like Richard was given the go-ahead to report live from the sky, and word from his end?” The screen switches back to the newsroom. “We are just about to switch over to him now. Thank you so much Audry” the anchorman says. “You too, we will be here to report on any further development!” The on-site reporter finishes before getting cut off and returns to the newsroom. 

There was a bit of a pause for a few seconds and the anchors talked amongst themselves, making a few dumb jokes that John Misses. He looks over to his wife. “I guess it was a good thing that we were the last ones to the shelter, last ones in and first ones out. We got to miss that shit show.” John says, jabbing a thumb at the TV.

“Yes, but It still took us, what? An hour to get home? At least the kids were asleep by the time we got home.” Susan says, cracking a few eggs. “How do you want your eggs?” “Sunnyside please,” John says, turning back to the TV just in time for the picture to change, sipping on coffee.

The anchorman finished his corny jokes and turned to the camera, “We now go to our eye in the sky. Richard, can you hear us at all?” The screen changed to a birds-eye view of the roads down below, the bottom header saying “Bumper to bumper for miles”

“I can hear you loud and clear Jim, as you can see the traffic just goes on for miles, heading away from the shelter” The camera pans along the roads “There seem to be multiple accidents moved to the sides of the major roads so traffic can keep moving, but it is not doing much.” The camera begins to pan a bit eastward. “As you can see it just stretches. I have never seen this many cars on the road before” 

Inside the helicopter, Richard looks west over towards the American-Canadian border for more to cover. “And towards the border, we should be seeing the same situa-...” he stops mid-sentence. The pause from the reporter is defining. Just the helicopter camera and the city view, panning as it hovers.

“Richard?” The anchorman says confused. 

“Everything alright up there?” “Richard?” The anchorwoman, now sounding concerned for her colleague. The silence lasts a little longer until Richards' voice comes back over. 

“James, turn the camera towards the border. Now!” the reporter yells to someone in the helicopter with him. The camera quickly pans over towards the Canadian-American border. 

“Hey Susan, come take a look at this,” John tells his wife, who just finished up the eggs. “What is it dear?” she asks as she turns off the stove and walks over to him. She starts to take in the TV images. 

The report starts to describe his view “Umm, sorry. I don’t know what I’m seeing up here. Normally where the old Fort Erie is now just forest. Yes, it’s just forest.”

“Richard, that does not make any sense.” The anchorman chimes in, the annoyance in his voice is very noticeable, clearly feeling like he’s being made a fool.

“Fly us over James.” “I don’t care if it’s illegal! Just do it!” The camera starts to move over the border and into Canada. Except, nothing is there. All the buildings, roads, shops, and everything else are now just. Forest. The scene is just an endless forest as far as the camera can show.

John drops his cup of coffee, smashing it onto the ground. Upstairs, hearing the commotion and then the breaking of the coffee cup, John and Susan's two kids are awoken and slowly make their way down the stairs. Sleep still in their eyes, tired and drowsy. Feeling as if they could sleep until Christmas. Finally make their way to the kitchen entrance rubbing their eyes. “Mommy? Daddy? What’s going on? The older one says, still rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Her little brother was right next to her, clutching a teddy bear. 

Susan quickly goes into mother mode “Don’t worry sweethearts. Everything is going to be fine. Come here.” George quickly runs over to her being picked up. Susan gestures for Sally to go to her father, still watching the TV. He picks her up and comforts her. 

More information comes out of the TV. “We have more reports coming in from other stations now, please bear with us folks.” The anchorwoman says just as she's being handed papers. “We are now getting multiple reports of the same scene from other Canadian and American border states. With what looks like just an endless forest.”

John, needing to see with his own eyes, “Sally, I need you to stay here with mommy and your brother, Ok? I need you to be a big girl.” “I will be right back, I need to see if grandma and grandpa are alright”  Sally looking up to her father nods in understanding. 

Looking over at her husband, “Be careful dear.”

“I will Susan” John says, giving her and George a kiss on the cheek. 

During the 2016 Presidential year, John's parents decided to retire north in Canada to escape it all. They moved right next to Peace Bridge to be close enough to visit every other weekend. During the preparations for The Storm, John and his dad set up telescoping shacks. Including a light signal to do Morse code to each other in case communications go out for a while.

John makes his way from the kitchen to the backyard of their home. The wooden telescoping shake was lifted to have a better viewpoint on the Canadian side of the border. Wooden stairs make their way into the main structure. A red wooden door was found in a junkyard and used for the entrance, Sally was the one who picked it out. John opens the door and steps inside.

The room was nothing special, the walls were bare wood with wire sockets on three of the 4 sides. On the wall facing the border, a massive window was installed to use the equipment. A large LED spotting lamp was added with a function to use More Code. A large telescope and an Amature Radio set were also on the desk as well in case of emergencies. It was his father's one that he bought during the Cold War. 

John peers through the telescope to see if the news report is true. They were right. Forest. A wall of thick green forest is the only thing he sees. Not a house, a shop, a school, or even a damned road to be seen. His parents' house should be right in front of his eyes, but it wasn't. Just fucking trees. 

In a last-ditch effort of hope, he tries to signal his father. Who at this time should have been in his shack right now. “-.. .- -.. --..-- / .- .-. . / -.-- --- ..- / - .... . .-. . ..--..” \[Dad, Are you there?\] Nothing. He tries it again, more slowly. Still nothing. They're gone, he thinks. Head in his hands trying his best not to cry, but the tears slowly start to fall from his eyes. One. Then two. Then three. 

“John! You better come see this!” Susan yells for him inside the house. He wipes away his tears, not for him but for his family's sake. He must be strong for them. He runs out of the shack, down the stairs, and into the house. Susan and the kids are no longer in the kitchen/dining room. Hearing the living room TV on that is where he goes. Susan, Sally, and baby George were all sitting in front of the TV. Susan had Sally in her lap, and George was right next to them playing with his teddy bear not having a care in the world. 

He comes over to them and picks up George still playing with his bear. Placing him on his lap while Sally is on her mother's. On the couch, they watch the breaking news on the TV. 

“MSNBC BREAKING NEWS” 8:55 am

“Good Morning America, My name is Andrea Mitchell.” “I am reporting Live from outside the White House, as President Seth Mckinney is about to address the nation.” Underneath the reporter, multiple headlines pass by. “No word of affiliate stations in the following countries: Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Australia” the list goes on. The Audio cuts back to the reporter. “The address to the Nation will be going over every Television network, every radio station.”

9:00 am

She pushes on her ear to listen to something, “We are now changing to the President of the United States”

Mexican-American Border, New Mexico 8:00 am 

The Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico is a barren mostly uninhabitable wasteland with the only life being a handful of creatures, including daring humans. The daring among them, normal people would call them “Crazy” for wanting to live in such a hospitable environment. These few not believing in words of authority, upon hearing about The Storm, and Bunkers decided to take it upon themselves to build their very own away from civilization. 

The desert seems vast and endless, a perfect spot for a handmade bunker. One such bunker sits just a few miles from the border. An old outhouse sits there, worn from the dry sun and freezing nights. An old farmer’s Ford truck accompanies it, hastily parked. 

The silence of the desert is suddenly filled with sounds of hydraulics and gears. A metal panel covered in sand lifts, shaklee. The crude hydraulic system struggling to lift it. Revealing stairs leading into the earth. With thumps of feet, an old man with long white bears and a shotgun comes out, slowly. Pointing the gun in every direction.

“HA!” he says in triumph “I knew the damneded government was liein about that stoopid Storm”

The old man takes off his hat revealing what is left of white hair, whipping sweat. “Martha! Get yer ass up here and take a lookie!” His wife, a skinny old woman comes stomping up after him “Alright, so you were right all along, can we go home now!”

“Don’t worry my love” he gives her a toothy smile “I have one more thing I want to see before that” “Get in Bessy!”

His wife, visibly angry with him “Fine, but I still think we should have gone into the shelters with everyone else” “Those earth shakes still making me shake a few” 

Not hearing his wife's remarks, he goes over to his truck and starts it. Giving it a few honks to make his wife move. “Am coming, am coming” she says walking over to the truck and getting in” They begin to drive off-road, southwest for a long while. Marth, now confused as to why they haven't gone back home. “Where are we going again?”

Her husband “I want to see how the border wall held up”

Now visibly angry with her bonehead husband “Are you kidding me? Good Lord! You couldn’t do this later?”

“I want to see how it held up is all. Is that so hard?” Giving her a toothy smile. Still angry with her husband, and in the end nothing she could do. He was driving. A short while later the old couple make it to the border wall. It was a sight to behold. In surprise, he slammed on the brakes, stepping out onto the hot sand in astonishment. “My god.”

Where was once a tall wall of steel, was now a steaming bent-over mess of metal. Red hot. So hot you could see the heat shimmer off the metal beams, distorting the view on the other side. Cautiously, the old man walks over for a closer look. 

“Be careful, please Ernest!” His wife yells at him from the truck. Still looking at the heap of metal, he waves a hand in understanding. Getting closer to the coolest and widest part, he hops over to the other side of the Wall. It's still desert, except for a hot purple glowing ditch in the earth. He estimated it to be 2 feet wide, but he was unable to tell how far it went down because of the smoke. It seemed to go on for miles, East to West, slowly curving. 

Ernest jumps back over the wall, almost losing his footing, and rushes his wife to get back in the truck. He starts the truck, kicking sand and first in the air as he speeds off to the nearest town. 

“What is it? Ernest? What did you see?” Martha questioned him. 

Ernest, Still paying attention to the road, describes the purple ditch in the sand, stretching for what seemed like miles and miles. “Good god,” she says to him. Facing back front, without a second thought she turned on and adjusted the radio to the nearest news station. 

“Ladies and gentlemen who are now toning in, we are about to go live at the White House in Washington, D.C. Where the President is about to address the nation over the recent news coming in. To recap, All over border states, the same thing is being said, to the Canadian-American border it seems that the country of Canada is gone. And reports are coming in from the southern border states on the Mexican-American border with the same kind of news, The Country of Mexico is gone” There was some whispering coming through the speakers, “We are now going to broadcast the President's address to the Nation”

Washington, D.C. 8:20 am, 40 minutes to National Address

The military has been called to keep D.C. under control and in order. The Capital was in complete chaos as more and more reports came in from news stations around the country. Senators running to and from offices and chambers trying to get a handle on things. Over the last few years, the political landscape of the United States has changed drastically. 

Both the House and Senate are Democratic Majority, ever since the fracturing and splitting of the Republican Party in Early 2022 has allowed the Democratic Party to have major wins in the Midterm Elections. And path the road to the landslide win in the 2024 US Election.

From the fracturing and splitting of the Republican Party, the Bull-Moose Party was formed with the framework of the Original party that Theodore Roosevelt formed in 1912 and incorporated a more Progressive-Conservative approach. The notable reasoning for this split is that former President Donald Trump was imprisoned for his involvement in the riots of January 6th, being charged with treason and disqualified from running. Was given 25+ years in federal prison with no parole. This was many republican congresspersons' final straw, and they decided to leave the party and for the Bull-Moose Party. 

After these shocking events, the Republican Party is now a shell of its former self. Having its reputation tarnished, it is now fully controlled by a handful of Far-right extreme senators. Who only have a small amount of power and a handful of states in their political control. 

Each party leader is in conversation with their respective house and senate leaders. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both convening in Schumer's office, finish going over how to keep Congress from going into a deadlock. The desk phone rings. 

Looking at the number on the phone, the Senate leader instantly recognizes the number and answers the phone. “Hello? Chuck Schumer speaking” The person on the other side has a feminine voice. “This is the White House, Please Hold for the President”. This was a subtle click then a wait, looking up at the House leader he puts the phone on speaker for him to join the conversation.

This is another click and a male voice comes through the phone speaker, “Chuck? It’s Seth. I wanted to call you personally. How’s it over there?”

“Well, Mister President. It’s chaos here at the moment, everyone is still trying to figure out what the hell happened. Jefferies is here with me now, you are on speaker sir.”

“Oh fantastic, I was planning on calling you next Hakeem. I’ll cut to the chase, I need both of you here at the White House in 30 minutes, I already have the Vice-President rounding up both the House and Senate Minority leaders of the GOP and Bull-Moose as we speak, we need to have a meeting to deal with the crisis”

The congressman, happy that the ball was moving in some direction “We were just discussing the same thing, sir, we-” Before he could finish speaking there was a knock on the office door. He tells the person on the other side to come. It's the Vice-President. Schumer standing to greet her “Madam Vice-President” Jeffries does the same.

Vice-President Lilly “I presume you know why I’m here?”

The president chimes in from the desk phone speaker “I was just telling them now Lilly, I presume you have the other four leaders?”

Both House and Senate Leaders looked behind the Vice-President, the four party leaders were standing in a little group. To the left was Mitt Romney, Senate Minority leader, and Liz Cheney, House Minority leader of the Bull-Moose Party. And to the right was Ted Cruz, Senate Minority leader, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, House Minority leader of the GOP. “Yes sir, they are outside waiting now.”

“Fantastic! I will see you all here soon!” 

*Click* 

The White House 8:25 am, 35 minutes to National Address

The subtle click of the plastic phone was the only sound in the Oval Office, just Seth, the desk, and other furniture. Taking a deep breath and rubbing his eyes, Seth pushes back from the Resolute Desk to stand and stretch. He’s still getting used to his new leather chair, a reproduction of the one JFK used. He just got it a few weeks before The Storm. 

He slides his fingers over the desk, walking over to the window only to see the Secret Service patrolling the perimeter. Some military vehicles are parked for extra security. At least it is a sunny morning. *Knock Knock*

Looking over to the door “Come in”

The door opens, and his aide, John Malkovoy comes in. “Sir, the camera crew is ready to set everything up.”

“Alright send them in. Also, is the speech done?”

“Yes sir, I have it with me,” John says walking in holding papers that could only be said speech. John ushers the camera crew in to start setting up for the broadcast. Moving the big furniture to make room for the equipment, they have to push it to the side, stacking the smaller pieces as there is no time to take it out of the office. 

Walking over to his aid, “So? How does it look?” questioning him.

“It looks great sir, encouraging, hopeful, informative, and straight to the point.”

“Good Good. And everyone else? How are they holding up?”

“Everyone's doing alright, Jen cried in her office for a few, but she picked herself back up and got to work.” Remembering something “Also The House and Senate Majority and Minority leaders are on their way with the Vice-President, I just got the word right before they left.”

“That's good to hear John.” Seth put his hand in front of him “The speech?”

John, taking a second for his brain to catch up “Oh Yes Sir, forgive me.” he hands him the speech.

“It’s fine,” Seth says thinking. He’s a good kid, a little slow, but still good. Seth thinks as he looks over the speech. “Give me some time to memorize it. Also have the members of Congress meet in the Cabinet Room, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the rest of the cabinet, set up a TV in there so they can watch the speech as well. Once I am done I will join them there. I'll leave everything else to you. I will be in the President's Room, come get me 15 minutes beforehand.”

“Yes Sir”

“John, Thank You,” He says to John, the aide nods his head and turns around to perform his duties. Seth walks by the camera crew setting things up, speech in hand. He opens a door to the president's room. Originally used as a separate dining room, when coming into the office, Seth wanted a place to sit and relax for a few minutes. To ease his nerves. The room was housed in a few soft comfortable chairs, a big dark chenille green sofa up against the wall, and a large oak coffee table in the middle of 2 couches. Side tables on each side of said couches and sofa. 

Seth walks over and sits in one of the big brown soft reading chairs in the corner, which has a lamp on it and a phone in case he needs anything. Sitting down and turning on the light, he starts to read the speech, muttering the words to himself. Hours before he mentioned he wanted to write some fast-action executive order to get ahead of the chaos that will most likely plague the Nation for some time. Many will not like what he has to do. Few of the orders will be mentioned in the speech. 

Time passes, and Seth has read the speech front to back multiple times. Before he started to read it again there was a knock on the door. 

Looking up from the speech to the door “Come”

The door opens and John walks in “We are 15 minutes from going live Sir”

“Good, could you get Victoria to come here, please? I need to ask her something about this speech. I want her opinion on something”

“Yes Sir, Right away” John turns around to go and get the Speechwriter. A few minutes go by when there's another knock on the door. “Come in”

The door opens and Victoria walks in, she's wearing black dress pants, a white button-up, and a navy blue blazer with black flats. She seems a little confused. “You wanted to see me, Sir?”

“Yes please, have a seat. Just wanted to talk about the speech for a minute before we go on the air”. He gestures to one of the chairs. She takes the offer. “It’s good, I just wanted to ask about the ending bit here” He points showing her, reading it off, “Thank you, and let us move forward together with courage and resolve” 

Looking from the point of the speech and back to him, “What’s wrong with it?”

Seth needs to explain a bit more. “I think it doesn't get the message through as to how serious the situation is. I believe to get the severity across it would be a good idea to have it end in a way I don’t normally end my speeches. Do you understand?”

“I think so Sir, I mean I thought about putting “God bless you and may god bless the United States of America,” But then I remembered throughout the campaign you stated that you were not a religious man. That's why I didn't add it in.”

“Yes I remember, but I think it would be a good idea to add something along the lines of that in, to show the seriousness of the situation we are in. To get it across” He gestured with his hands with a bounding crossing motion, like crossing a line. 

Victoria takes a moment to ponder what he means, “I see what you mean. Want me to write it in?” He hands her the paper, she takes a pen crosses the old final sentence out, and replaces it with a new sentence. “There. How does that look?” She hands the speech back to him, he rereads the final bit with the added change. 

“Looks good Victoria” looking up from the speech.

“Is there anything else Sir?” She asks as she gets up from the chair. 

Looking up at her “No, thank you.” She gives a little nod and makes her way out the door. Looking down at his watch, 5 minutes to the address. Quickly looking over the speech once more with the changes, he makes his way back to the Oval Office. 

Upon opening the door, the once-active room fell silent when he walked in. “Hope I’m not interrupting anything?” There was a little chuckle from a few of the people. Seth makes his way to the Resolute Desk and makes himself comfortable. Speech now in front of him. John walks over to him “Sir, the Congress members are in the Cabinet Room.”

“Thank You, John. I presume the TV is in there as well?” looking over to the aid. 

“Yes Sir”

“Good”

The aid walks away as the camera crew is done setting up.

The man behind the camera, “Alright everyone we are on the air in.” He gestures with his fingers. He gestures with his fingers “5, 4, 3, 2” And mouths One, and a light goes on the Camera.

Millions of Americans sit in front of the TV, their phones, Radios, or any other device that can play the speech from the President. Waiting in anticipation for what he has to say. 

“My fellow Americans, Today October 19th, 2025 was supposed to be a celebration. Not just an American celebration, but a worldwide celebration. Of our species surviving an extinction-level event. One that would have changed the fabric of our society and the course of our future. Sadly as many of you know, that does not seem to be the case. 

As to what I am speaking of for those who still do not understand. On our borders with our northern and southern neighbors, something extraordinary has happened. On our northern border, which once was homed to Canada, the cities, towns, roads, and parks. There are now mountains, forests, grasslands, arctic tundras, and many more. Our southern border is showing the same thing. Mexico, where the same kind of cities and towns, now sit deserts, rainforests, mountains, and barren coastlines untouched by humanity. 

Moreover, with extensive time and research from our satellites overhead, this government believes one thing, we are no longer on Earth. Looking extensively at photos taken by said satellites has shown that the areas of Central America, and the Caribbean have also been affected. The island state of Hawaii and the Territory of Puerto Rico are still with us.

Hawaii has been moved to less than 50 miles off the coast of California. And as we speak we are in contact with the Governor of Puerto Rico and Hawaii to get them anything they need. Our overseas territories have now been moved to various areas along both the Pacific coast and the Atlantic coast, and we are now trying our very best to get in contact with them via satellite. To the reason why we and these landmasses have been brought to this strange world. We do not know, and we may not know for a time.

I promised you when I took the office of the presidency to be as full, transparent, and truthful; Let me be absolutely clear: as of right now, we are cut off from home. But that does not mean we are alone here, later this evening we will be releasing orbital photographs and basic maps on the official government website. To the east of us sits 2 continents, for now, we will be designating them the following: Alpha will be the closest continent and Bravo will be the farthest away from North America. These names will stay until we know the official names of the 2 continents from those who call them home.

In response to this unprecedented situation, the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defence, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I have decided to raise our national defense posture from DEFCON 3 to DEFCON 2. Effective immediately, all military leave is canceled, and all service members of the United States Armed Forces are ordered to report to their nearest base for further instructions.

To address this crisis, I will be signing several executive orders, including the following:

1. All landmasses that were once the nations of Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean are now under U.S. protection. These areas shall be designated as U.S. territories until further notice.
2. Expeditions into these territories will begin promptly to locate critical resources.
3. The Stafford Act will be put in place, and FEMA and the Red Cross will be put into full effect.
4. All non-essential government services will be temporarily suspended.

Later today I will be discussing with the Heads of both the House and Senate Parties how to apply for these orders precisely. 

I strongly advise businesses to adopt a work-from-home policy, this will work under the Defense Production Act until we can acquire the resources lost from imports. Furthermore, the federal and state governments will convene with the Department of Labor, and the Department of Transportation on how to maneuver this great obstacle ahead of us. 

If you are a business that cannot do a work-from-home policy, we ask you to please get in contact with the DOT, or do vehicle sharing between employees. 

In preparation for The Storm doing far greater damage, each major city bunker has a minimum of 6 months' worth of supplies. State governments are here advised to ration those supplies out for a time until they can be replaced. With this in mind, all non-essential manufacturing is hereby suspended under the Defense Production Act. As well as the Stafford and National Emergencies Act to coordinate in repurposing industries to manufacture essential goods for the time being. More information will be released on the official government website.

My fellow citizens, I know many of you are feeling a mix of confusion, fear, and perhaps even loss in light of these events. We are in uncharted territory, but we are not without strength, and we are not without each other. We have faced extraordinary challenges before, and together we have always found a way forward.

To every American, I ask you to remain steadfast. Trust in your leaders, look out for one another, and remember that, as always, we are stronger together. This is a time of great uncertainty, but I have faith in our unity, resilience, and shared strength. Together, we will face this new world with courage and resolve.

Thank you, and may God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.""

I’ve been buying ahead on foods I can store longer-term (ex, dry beans, coffee that can be stored in the freezer, etc.) This isn’t prepper level, but I’m trying to buy while it’s presumably cheaper and lets me opt out of even a few purchases during the next administration.

Also purchased: Shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, bar soap, laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, razor blades, coffee filters, motor oil, bulk bottles of dish soap, etc.

I’m also planning on getting fresh rechargeable batteries as mine no longer hold a charge.

I try to be low-consumption in general, so it’s been an interesting process for me.

The library is a fantastic resource I use a lot for audio books, movies, craft lessons, etc, in addition to physical books. I try to buy thoughtfully and plastic-free whenever possible, but I’m planning on continuing to improve in 2025.

I moved down here with my girlfriend a little over a year ago. Things got rocky between us rather quick following the move, and we didn't get out to socialize much. We decided to split up this summer and she moved back to our home state, but I wasn't able to due to the lease/work commitments. I also really love this area and would prefer to stay!

Any advice for meeting late 20/early 30 year olds?

I've gone to a few bars and coffee shops the past couple months and I've met a handful of awesome people, some of which I've exchanged numbers with and we've met up again, but the age gap remains an issue for me. 

I'd like to avoid the college bar scene if possible. Drinking is not a problem, but I don't like having to yell over music when trying to meet people

My next plan is to attend some events at game shops, does anyone know if there are others around my age at those events?

Should I turn to the ""find friends"" version of dating apps? I've been hesitant to this point as I believe most people act differently behind a keyboard

1hpchv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1hpchv1/tonsillectomy_experience_as_a_21_year_old_male/,Tonsillectomy Experience as a 21 year old male,"After years of recurrent and chronic tonsillitis—and a particularly bad year of longer term complications from repeat infection—I finally got my tonsils removed on 12/16. This group has been super helpful as I prepared for and navigated my own recovery, so I only feel it’s right to share my experience. 

**Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional and nothing I say should be taken as medical advice. Everyone’s experience is unique and you should consult your doctor for the most informed information.**

Surgery 12/16: my operation took place late-AM. It was very smooth, and was not very stressful for me. My surgeon had great bedside manner and made the process as stress free as possible. I experienced very minimal discomfort after waking up, drank a few glasses of water, had a popsicle and went on my way.

 Day 0/1: Not too painful. Tylenol and Advil was sufficient. I had a few liquidy protein smoothies, drank lots of water, Gatorade, and had some lukewarm bone broth. Sleeping the first night was difficult, and fair warning, it didn’t get easier until day 9/10. 

Day 2-4: Pain increased, so I began to take oxycodone and Tylenol as prescribed to me. At this point, I also had a lot of swelling making it hard to swallow even water. I called my doctor and was prescribed prednisone, which alleviated A LOT of the swelling and pain within a few hours of the first dose. This was a game changer for me. I continued to consume soft foods like protein smoothies, bone broth, coconut water, Gatorade etc. I also started eating mashed potatoes. This was a staple for me all recovery. I cut my mashed potatoes with bone broth to make it a soupier consistency and easier to eat. Around day 2, I also stopped talking much because it was too painful. I decided to rest my voice and avoid unnecessary discomfort. 

Between days 1-2, I did have 3 minor bleeds. But all stopped at home within an 30mins-an hour by holding ice water in the back of my throat, as instructed by my surgeon. I did not bleed again after day 2. 

Day 4-8: the pain really increased during these days. I’m not exactly sure what day was the worst or when it peaked. All of these days are kind of a blur to me. I also became intolerant to cold foods. So I quit consuming anything colder than room temperature. Mashed potatoes were still on the table, and I started eating eggs. A lot of soft scrambled eggs. 

Day 9 & 10: this is when I started to turn a corner. The pain decreased notably and I was able to talk a little bit again and started to regain an appetite. I discontinued the oxycodone at this point. My diet remained similar to the days prior. I found the soft foods not to be too painful, and I didn’t feel like putting myself through extra discomfort to try out new things. 

Day 11-13: strong improvements everyday. I could talk almost without pain again. My voice still sounded muted, but I expect this to improve with time. I started mixing in ground beef, soft cooked fish, shredded chicken and pasta to my diet. My body thanked me for this! I also was able to finally start sleeping at night. The nights prior were very hard for me to sleep, and I was starting to feel unwell from the lack of sleep. Days 12 & 13 I left the house for a few hours to run light errands with my mom, grab coffee, etc. It was nice to get out of the house! 

Today (day 13) I feel about 75% back to normal. I’m still eating relatively soft foods to be on the cautious side, but I’m content with the variety of things that I can now eat. I do look forward to eating a steak soon though 😋

WHAT HELPED ME:
- HYDRATION. It’s important to stay hydrated for healing, but also to keep your scabs moist. I drank a lot of water, and tried to get electrolytes in through coconut water and Gatorade. Coconut water was great for me to drink all throughout recovery, and was an easy way to drink some calories. Gatorade was good for me the first few days, but by day 3 or so, the salt stung too much. So I stopped drinking this until later in recovery ~day 10. 
- HUMIDIFIER. I invested in a high-quality humidifier to keep my throat moist as I slept. I think this helped a fair bit. 
- ICE. I can’t say enough good things about ice. It relieved a lot of pain throughout the recovery. I used an ice head wrap (like the one for wisdom teeth) and an additional ice pack to rest on my lower neck/throat. I iced 10+ times a day for the first 10-11 days. 
- PREDNISONE. This helped relieve SO much pain. I think a lot of my initial pain came from swelling. I took prednisone days 2-10ish. I was initially prescribed 5 days worth, but requested a few days more after I realized how much it helped. I will note, the prednisone did make it harder for me to sleep and stay asleep. 
- HEALTHY FOODS. I’m a healthy eater in general, and am a big believer that the foods you consume affect how well you heal. I prioritized consuming high quality foods like bone broth, clean-ingredient protein powders, organic coconut water, etc. I’m sure this played a part in my recovery. 
- LAXATIVES. I knew from reading y’all’s posts that I would be constipated after surgery. I began proactively taking Miralax 1-2x daily and Ducolax 1x daily and a probiotic to prevent extreme constipation. Yes, I got constipated, but not too bad because I started laxatives before it was too late. 
- WALKS. I took 2-3 short (10-15 min), very low-intensity walks starting on day 2 or so. This helped relieve my restless legs, gave me sunlight, and kept me from going stir crazy indoors. 
 
RANDOM NOTES: 
- Morning time was the most painful for me. Waking up and drinking water was very uncomfortable, but once my throat got reacclimated to drinking, I felt better for the rest of the day. 
- Sleeping wasn’t too fun. I had a hard time sleeping, partially induced by the prednisone I was taking, and by sleeping with my head elevated. 
- I developed a cough after surgery. I think this is pretty common, and my surgeon said not to worry. I still have it, but it’s improving. I was afraid it might affect my scabs but it didn’t seem to. 
- Salt stings bad! After day 2, I had to stop drinking Gatorade and consuming pedialyte pops because the salt in them stung too much to tolerate. 
- Iced Coffee. I’m a big coffee lover. The first two or three days, I didn’t drink any coffee just because I was so out of it. But I started drinking a glass of iced coffee in the mornings around day 3 or 4. This made me happy, gave me a little boost of energy and made me feel a little more normal. I knew hot coffee is off the table, so I opted for iced.
- Water alarms. I did wake up at night every few hours to drink water. More frequently earlier on, and less frequently later in the recovery. I do think this helped prevent some pain in the mornings when I woke up and drank my first sips of water for the day. 
- I used so many tissues and paper towels to spit out mucus during the first week or so of recovery. Like so many. Stock up. 

Look, there’s nothing fun about this surgery. It’s painful as hell, but I got through it, and I know I’ll be glad I had my tonsils removed when I no longer deal with 24/7 tonsillitis and recurrent infections. It’s uncomfortable, but not as scary as some of these posts make it seem. If you are about to go through this, or are just starting your recovery, I wish you the best. I’m thankful for all of the posts here that helped me prepare for my experience, and I’m hoping you might find something helpful from this post.

*Prologue:*

Anise was sitting at home, alone as usual. The Winterfest holidays were nearly over, and tomorrow she would have to return to work. Shifting her focus from the tv to her watch, she felt that sinking feeling that one feels when they know their holiday is coming to an end.

""Better head to bed, I guess"" she mumbled to herself, a note of disappointment evident in her voice. Still she hesitated, weighing up the pros and cons of a good nights sleep vs a few more hours of blissful sloth-ing.

Before she could really make up her mind, her tv show was interrupted by an emergency broadcast. Apparently Mt. Komorebi, which she hadn't even known was a volcano, was currently erupting. Through the window she could see thick flurries of what she had thought was snow, but now realised was volcanic ash. Startled, she realised that the settling debris had already nearly blocked out the entire window. She wouldn't be able to get out. Not that she would want to - who would charge out into the ash and lava and flying rocks, when they could stay safe inside their comfortable home?

How lucky she was, she thought, to be living in a world where houses were indestructible and your fridge was always full of food, even if you were completely cut off from the outside world.

With a stretch, she settled back on the couch and wondered what she ought to do now.

""Well, I guess there's no work tomorrow, so I may as well stay up all night after all!""

Legend has it that Mt. Komorebi is a sleeping dragon that over time has been encased in ice and snow, slumbering peacefully with the villages perched on top. In ancient times, villagers would set offerings down in gratitude for the home the dragon provides.

In modern times, this home is taken for granted by many. The fertile land and bustling tourism trade had made Mt. Komorebi a prosperous place, and it soon became known for being on the leading wave of technological advances. 

It was these technologies which saved the country's citizens, as every house in Mt. Komorebi was fitted with a Sim-Tec SmartHome system, ensuring comfort and security even without external input.

Though the citizens are safe for now, they have no means of freeing themselves from their stony prisons.

*Trapped in their own homes, how will the citizens cope? How many will fall apart? And how many will bloom where they are planted?*

***1. Anise Winters***

With her small 2 bedroom home covered in ash and solidifying lava, Anise was trapped. She knew it would be unlikely that anyone would ever bother digging her out, and so she treated the situation as an early retirement. No more would she have to work, or pay bills. No more being forced to attend work parties, or make small talk with her overly-friendly neighbours.

The only real downside, she mused, was that now she would never be able to travel. It had always been her dream to travel the world. As soon as she graduated highschool she left the sleepy town of Willow Creek and spent her entire life savings on a one way ticket to Mt. Komorebi. She had intended to backpack around the world, but found it more difficult than she expected. She'd been forced to get an office job and 5 years later she was still stuck there, trying to earn enough money to keep travelling.

Despite being encased in stone, Anise had genuinely never felt more free. She had the freedom to make her own choices, be as loud as she wanted, and follow her own schedule, sleeping & eating whenever she was so inclined. She was free from other people's expectations and rules, and was no longer bothered by noisy inconsiderate neighbours.

For the first year of her imprisonment, Anise mostly just lounged around, reading and watching movies. She finally had time to catch up on all those shows everyone at the office talked about. As time went on she thought she would get bored, but that day never came. Instead she became happier and more content with each passing day. She began exploring the world from her own home - listening to exotic music, following foreign recipes she found online, and experimenting with the fashions of other countries.

You may have thought she'd be lonely, trapped by herself. But Anise loved solitude, and besides, Father Winter visited every year. Socialising once a year was enough for her at first, but eventually she did start feeling a little lonely. Her house started feeling a little too quiet, and she had almost stopped speaking aloud entirely. When Winterfest finally rolled around again, Anise could barely sleep. She was just so excited to finally have someone to talk to again.

That year Father Winter brought her a smart speaker. She was skeptical at first, but soon found herself talking cheerfully to it as she went about her day. It revitalised her to have someone to talk to, even if that ""someone"" was a household appliance.

The next year he brought her a pet sheep. Anise was overjoyed with the creature which loved to frolic and play. She was always cheered up by its antics, and loved snuggling against its soft fleece.

The next year, Anise begged him not to leave. They had developed a strong friendship over the years, and there had always been an undercurrent of romance between them. This year they finally acted on it. Father Winter agreed to move in, and began going by his real name - Hugh Healy. Hugh promised to never leave Anise alone again.

***2. Bell Winters***

Bell's father gave up his immortality to be with Anise and start a family. By the time Bell was a teenager, her parents had passed away from old age. Her childhood had been filled with love, comfort, and freedom. Influenced by her mother's love of exploring other cultures, Bell embraced the multicultural aspects of Winterfest. After all, it's a holiday that incorporates so many traditions from so many cultures.

Living alone in a house buried under solidified lava, Bell lived in darkness. So when Winterfest came around, she particularly embraced the spirit of hope. The hope that the darkness of winter would one day give way to the sun & warmth of spring. In Bell's life there was so much darkness, that she sometimes thought she'd never see the spring.

For Bell, Winterfest was a deeply spiritual time of year. She lit candles, remembered her parents and the good times, sang songs of lament and hope, and made a vow of simple living. For the duration of winter, she would eat only what she could grow herself, and use only what she had made herself. It grounded her and every year when spring came, she felt reinvigorated and inspired.

As a child, when the new Father Winter came to visit on Winterfest, he would give her a gift and then spend hours in the kitchen speaking with his predecessor. Their laughter and friendly conversation was a wonderful lullaby for little Bell. Over time the new Father Winter came to be a very good friend of the family. 

After her parents died, he stopped his lengthy visits. And one day when she was a young adult, an entirely new Father Winter came to visit on Winterfest. Collin Gonzalez was younger, and more reserved. Bell instantly distrusted him.

Over the years she began to think about him more often. When she was cooking, she found herself wondering if she should offer him a meal next time. When she was petting her mother's pet sheep, she found herself thinking about his fluffy beard. Hesitatingly, she began texting him. To her surprise the conversation flowed easily over text, despite how awkward it was in person.

As Bell gradually fell in love with him, she began withdrawing from him. Scared to fall in love, because she knew how much it hurt to lose someone you love. That year on Winterfest she went to bed early and turned off all the lights, locking herself in her bedroom to avoid seeing him.

The next morning she felt a strange pang of regret. She hadn't realised how much it would hurt not to see him. Maybe she was already in too deep, and would get hurt either way. She picked up her phone, hoping there would be a text from him. There wasn't. She lay in bed for most of the day, feeling too gloomy to get up and do anything. At some point she must have dozed off, because she was awakened by the appetising aroma of freshly baked apple pie. With her heart pounding, she hesitatingly moved down the stairs, and saw him in the kitchen. The man she had fallen in love with. Baking an apple pie.

Looking up, he seemed relieved. He gently helped her descend the stairs and ushered her onto a chair, placing a large slice of pie on the table in front of her. She ignored the pie.

They looked at each other for a few moments, each trying to put their thoughts into words. She asked him why he was here. He told her he was worried when he didn't see her, so he'd stayed until she woke up. He asked why she had stopped responding to his texts. She started eating the pie, in an attempt to avoid the topic. He sat patiently while she finished eating, and then reached for her empty plate. Their hands touched, and their eyes met. Almost in unison they both blurted out ""I love you"".

***3. Carol Winters***

Although they were buried underground, the house was fitted with a Sim-Tec SmartHome system which controlled the lights and thermostat. Gradually the lights brightened in the morning and faded at night, with the hours changing as the seasons did. In winter the thermostat also cooled the house - not enough to freeze them, but enough to make them grateful for the cozy fire.

Although Carol didn't mind the long dark winters, when the house cooled enough to enjoy a cup of hot cocoa by the fire, what she really loved was the summertime. Those bright warm days that filled you with energy. The days when all you wanted to do was splash and play in the nice cool water, and eat fresh fruit. The days she spent playing loudly and happily with her siblings. Carol was the eldest of the triplets. Growing up she had a great friendship with her sister Candy, and her brother Caine. The trio were best friends, and despite sharing a cramped bedroom, they never fought.

Homeschooled by their parents, Carol was captivated by the differences between the northern and southern hemispheres. As she grew up, she imagined what it would be like to celebrate Winterfest in the summer time. Her favourite festival combined with her favourite time of year. She was particularly drawn to one continent - a gigantic continent that belonged to only one country, and had all sorts of climates, from deserts to tropical rainforests. When she became an adult, Carol decided it was time to make her dreams come true! From now on she would celebrate Winterfest during the summer time! BBQs, water fun, and nice refreshing fruit salads. 

It took some work to convince Father Winter to come visit them in summer instead of winter, but eventually the appeal of a summer holiday was too much for Federico Engle to refuse. Due to the out-of-season nature of their summer Winterfest, Federico was free to spend multiple days with the family. He turned up, gave out gifts, and then they spent 3 whole days just relaxing and soaking up the summer vibes. Federico and Candy had an annual watermelon eating contest, and Caine practiced all year to beat him at MySims Racing. Over time Carol & Federico's friendship grew into a casual relationship.

One year Federico pulled Carol into the garden and confessed to her that he was thinking about retiring. Like her, he preferred the warmth and it was getting harder and harder for him to find the motivation to do his usual Winterfest run. It was this moment that Carol chose to reveal that they were going to have a baby. Federico was overjoyed, and proposed right then and there.

The small family continued to enjoy life together, welcoming baby Dove, and eventually being joined by the new Father Winter, Adam Seaman, who became Caine's spouse.

***4. Dove Winters***

With so many people crammed into the tiny two bedroom house, Dove found it difficult to get time to herself. She found that she could lose herself in programming and by doing so, completely drown out the chaos around her. As she grew up her search for solitude became a necessity. She felt she would lose her mind if she couldn't get just a few hours of peace and quiet a day. Please, please! Just a few hours! Surely that's not too much to ask?

Browsing the web she found that LIES Inc. was still functioning. LIES Inc. (Lacklustre Idealistic Environmental Solutions) was a company founded by one sim, and run primarily by AI. Due to the lack of human involvement, the company was still running despite the worldwide collapse of civilisation. The AI running the company were hiring civic planners to work from home. Dove immediately applied and was accepted. She used her full time employment as leverage to gain full control of one bedroom of the house. The others are happy to accommodate her and set up sleeping bags in the loungeroom. Finally Dove had her peace and quiet.

As an only child, Dove found herself alone as the older generation aged up and passed on. With a house that was finally quiet, Dove still locked herself in that same small room, filling her free time with freelance programming work. Almost as though she was now trying to ignore the dead silence of the house that once bustled with life.

Although she put up perfunctory decorations each year, she never even bothered to open the gifts which Father Winter left her under the tree each year. Her annual tradition was to go downstairs, eat a bowl of yoghurt with fruit, & pull out the storebought ready-decorated tree from under the stairs. She would then go back upstairs, locking herself in her room and not emerging for at least 24 hours. The next day she would head downstairs, eat a bagel, and take down the tree, before again heading back to her office. She didn't need a social life, or a family, or even hobbies. All she needed was to dive into her work and block out the reality she was living in.

One Winterfest as she was just passing middle-aged, disaster struck. Her router needed to be restarted. Which meant.... she would need to go downstairs.

She sat there, wondering whether it was worth it or not, maybe she could just continue her work tomorrow and go to bed early tonight? No, she wouldn't be able to sleep knowing that there was a stranger creeping around in the house below her. It was 7:30pm. She had half an hour before he should arrive.

Deciding to risk it, she crept down the stairs, pausing at every imagined sound. She made it to the ground floor, with only the twinkle of Winterfest tree lights guiding her way. Then she froze. She'd managed to avoid Winterfest since she was a child, but now she found herself face to face with Cooper Wilcox.

Although she had thought she was comfortable in her solitude, having another living breathing person in front of her made her realise just how starved for companionship she was. She hadn't had a real conversation with anyone in years, and when was the last time she felt the warm touch of human skin? She suddenly remembered - the last time anyone had hugged her, was on her 15th birthday. Her mother gave her a great big hug, and being a recalcitrant teenager, Dove had shrugged her off and told her that she's too old to hug her parents. Dove had slowly shied away from human contact, so gradually that she hadn't even realised it until decades later.

Looking at Cooper, it was as though he could read her mind. The two fell into each others arms, and simply embraced under the gently twinkling lights. Soon one thing led to another and the house was no longer silent and empty.

Although Dove continued her workaholic lifestyle, she made changes for her family. Cooper looked after the girls most of the day and night, but they would have breakfast as a family, and at night Dove would read them a bedtime story. Gradually though, things started shifting back to how they were before. Dove still joined them for breakfast, but would quickly finish her bowl of cereal and then take her coffee upstairs to her office. Some nights she would join Cooper & read the girls their bedtime story, but more and more often she lost track of time and forgot to even say goodnight. She'd forget to eat too, if her husband didn't bring her meals to her.

Cooper happily raised their two daughters almost on his own, and despite their mother's solitary ways, they never felt alone.

***5. Eve Winters***

For Eve and Evergreen, Winterfest was the happiest time of year. It was the one time their mother would put aside her career and devote herself to family time. Her father raised the girls to be full of holiday cheer all year round, and as they grew up their Winterfest spirit only grew stronger.

Every room in the house (except for her mother's study) was cramped with wreaths and garlands, Winter Holiday music played every minute of every day, and although the girls had to be in bed before he arrived, they would leave out fresh cookies for Father Winter each year. Eve loved to bake and knit, and soon made herself a stunning collection of ugly Winterfest sweaters. Evergreen preferred to paint, and wore slightly more subdued festive clothing.

To be honest, Eve had always dreamed of marrying Father Winter, and hoped that when they finally met, they would get along. However, when their first Winterfest as young adults came around, it was Evergreen who stole the new Father Winter's heart!

Eve was disappointed, but as she got to know Issac Hong she realised that the two of them would never have worked out, and that he was actually perfect for her sister. She congratulated the two whole heartedly on their wedding day, and was thrilled when they announced their pregnancy. Eve loved being an aunt, but it made her want her dream romance even more.

As a result, when the next Winterfest came around, Eve threw herself at the \*new\* new Father Winter, Gregory Mintzias, and scared him off. Issac sat her down and told her a bit about his successor, and suggested that maybe she should write to him and apologise. Evergreen also had a private word with her, encouraging her not to try to force a romance and instead to approach Greg with no expectations. ""Just get to know each other, and if it's meant to be, then it will be.""

And as it turned out, it was indeed meant to be. Evergreen and Issac's son Fir soon had cousins - Eve and Gregory became the parents of triplets named Frankincense, Figgy, and Fable. The household was louder and more joyful than ever before. 

It truly felt like Winterfest every day.

***6. Frankincense Winters***

Winterfest? More like vomit fest.

Surrounded constantly by Winterfest cheer, Frankie grew to hate the holidays. As a toddler she has no choice but to endure the year-round holiday costumes. But as a child, she ran away whenever her mother tried to force her into ugly Winterfest sweaters. A wise move, as that very summer her sister Figgy died of overheating while wearing a sweater and beanie, sitting by the roaring fire, and drinking cup after cup of hot cocoa. What kind of parents put the ""holiday spirit"" above the literal safety of their children?

Despite the death, her family kept their spirits high, and simply hung her stocking every year as though she was still with them. They continued their tradition of 7 square meals a day (supplemented by constant snacks and hot drinks) even after Frankie's cousin Fir died young of a heart attack. Aunt Evergreen died soon after - Eve said it was heartbreak, but Frankie suspected it was clogged arteries.

Somehow Uncle Issac and her father Gregory seemed completely unaffected by their unhealthy diets. Frankie theorised that it was a perk of being Father Winter. However, since they had given up their immortality, they too would eventually pass away from old age (albeit a lot later in life than normal sims).

As the household numbers dwindled, it became harder for Frankie to escape her mother's attempts to spread holiday cheer. Everywhere she turned, her mother was there with some festive activity for them to do together, desperate to spend time with her remaining family members. Frankie wasn't against spending time with her family, but why did it always have to be about Winterfest?

One fateful Halloween, Eve was beginning her annual Winterfest decorating spree, trying to find any square centimetre of space that wasn't already decked to the brim. This year she had decided that they needed more twinkling lights. Surely THAT would awaken Frankincense's Winterfest spirit! After 3 days of covering every inch of the house in more lights than Frankie would have thought possible, Eve finally hit the switch. But before she could admire her handywork, she was electrocuted. It would be reasonable to assume that Eve's DIY electrical work was the culprit.

Frankie may have felt guilty, since it was her own stubbornness which had driven her mother to such unsafe extremes, however she was also rational enough to realise that her mother should have avoided the obvious dangers of splicing electrical wires without proper training or basic safety measures.

And just like that, Fable and Frankie were left alone in the house. After they mourned their family, they decided to remove the excessive Winterfest decorations, and began taking steps to improve their health. Although they initially agreed to do Winterfest at the appropriate time of year, as winter approached, Frankie began to feel anxious. Her fear only mounted as time moved on, and finally she had a breakdown. Fable gently comforted her, and compassionately agreed to not decorate the house this year.

The next year was much the same. 

By the third year, Frankie was no longer having panic attacks, but was still unable to handle Winterfest decorations or holiday music. Fable kindly suggested that they don't decorate the shared sections of the house, and that Fable would only decorate inside her own bedroom. Frankie bought her a pair of earbuds so that she could still listen to winter holiday music. It would be the last Winterfest gift Frankie would give for a long time.

The sisters lived peacefully, both happy with their agreement.

However, that contentment didn't last long. Fable devised a plan to bring the Winterfest spirit back into their home, by setting Frankie up with Father Winter! She delicately brought it up with Frankie, and despite her best attempts to avoid a Winterfest romance, Frankie gradually found herself becoming more interested in the man that her sister thought was ""just so perfect for you!"". Eventually she agreed to text him, and the two started a long-distance flirtationship. When Winterfest came around that year, Frankie found herself unexpectedly excited to finally meet Aubrey Ash face to face.

During the following year Fable noticed that Frankie's coldness had melted a little, and hesitantly suggested they put up a tree this year. To her surprise, Frankie not only agreed, but added to it by suggesting they have a grand meal, and perhaps even a gift exchange.

Fable excitedly set about painting her sister the best present she could, and Frankie in turn carved Fable a lovely bunny sculpture. On Winterfest Aubrey arrived and the two love birds shut themselves away in Frankie's room. When they emerged, they asked Fable how she'd feel about Aubrey moving in with them. The household was filled with joy once again!

But good things never last. Being a third wheel 24/7 led to Fable becoming jealous, and she wasn't sure if she had made the right choice by introducing Aubrey to her sister. It wasn't very long before Aubrey and Fable started an affair, which continued behind closed doors even while Frankie endured a somewhat uncomfortable pregnancy.

Even the very day that little Ginger was born, Aubrey missed the birth because he was in bed with Fable. Frankie didn't suspect a thing, until one evening it was bathtime and her daughter was hiding. Frankie went into Fable's bedroom, but instead of finding a wayward toddler, she caught her sister and her husband red handed.

After Ginger was located, bathed, and tucked into bed, Frankie confronted the adulterers. She divorced Aubrey on the spot, and declared them both her enemies. She wouldn't listen to either of them, and demanded that her ex-husband leave and never contact them again.

Aubrey agreed to end the affair and leave the house, which fatally broke Fable's heart. His departure and Fable's death left Frankie raising Ginger all on her own. She firmly banned Winterfest from the house, and anytime Ginger asked about Winterfest or her father, she was sternly told not to ask those sorts of questions.

***7. Ginger Winters***

Though her mother forbade the topic of Winterfest, that just made Ginger more curious. When she was a child she began researching the holiday on her laptop, and she would often fantasise about celebrating it with both of her parents, a perfect happy family.

Ginger took up many creative hobbies, and when her mother died she invited her father to move back home. The long-estranged father & daughter focused on the heart of Winterfest, with homemade decorations and feasts enjoyed together. The only thing missing in Ginger's life was a family of her own. Luckily, Toby Westbrook came down the chimney and the two felt an instant connection. Ginger wanted lots of kids, but in the end they were happy with their twins Holly & Harmony, and their youngest son Herald.

Each year as Winterfest approached, Ginger and her family began making decorations, preparing delicious meals, and making heartfelt gifts for one another. She became skilled in everything from painting, to jewelry making, to cooking, and even becoming an expert nectar maker. Each year the house was decked out with homemade decorations, and the family spent Winterfest eve cooking together in the kitchen. The house was filled with love and laughter, which would endure even after Ginger and Toby passed away from old age.

***8. Holly Winters***

Holly thought Winterfest was a bit boring. Sure, there was delicious food and decorated trees and a stranger who comes down your chimney to give you gifts... But what was the point of all these traditions? Where did they come from? Her mother insisted that Winterfest is about being with family, and making things yourselves. But the internet had other ideas. The internet claimed these were religious symbols, and since Holly wasn't religious (and had never met anyone who WAS religious), she was confused. If her family wasn't religious, but they celebrated Winterfest, then how could Winterfest be a religious holiday?

She began delving into various religions and founds lots of conflicting information. As an easily frustrated teenager, she had nearly given up on searching for meaning when she came across an article on Buddhism. It caught her attention and as she read more she began feeling very excited. Here. Here was the meaning she sought. Here was a path towards a contented life.

From then on she practiced mindfulness in her daily life and gradually it became easy and natural for her to forgive and accept, rather than to hold resentment and try to control the people and events surrounding her. She joined her siblings in their annual Winterfest celebrations, and they sometimes joined her in her meditations. One year, with the help of the new Father Winter, Felix Powers, they surprised her by making a meditation area in their garden.

When Holly and Felix began a family, Harmony and Herald wished them the best, and the small household continued their happy existence.

***9. Ivy Winters***

With ""hippies"" for parents, Ivy became focused on appearances. Although there were no outsiders to impress, Ivy did her best to always be her idea of the perfect hostess. As a teen she became interested in cooking, and obsessed with keeping the house clean. As a young adult she began hosting dinner parties for the family, although it may seem odd to have such a formal gathering for people who you see every day, Ivy relished the weekly gatherings. To her, it was a well ordered island in a sea of chaos.

To her joy she discovered that the new Father Winter, Gerald Drew, was a kindred spirit. A fellow snob in a world of slobs! Together they had two daughters, and hosted perfect dinner parties every week. On Winterfest after the hubbub of the holiday was done, and the kids were in bed, the two liked to sit by the fire and share a bottle of nectar.

Ivy couldn't imagine a better life than the one she was blessed with.

***10. Joy Winters***

With parents like Ivy and Gerald, Joy had no choice but to follow in the footsteps of millions of teens before her, and rebel! Her neatfreak mother, obsessed with appearances and manners. Her mildly sexist father, still giving her dolls as a teenager, as though she would never grow up in his eyes. The house constantly reeking of disinfectant, and sparkling as though made of ice. Joy found the house as cold as ice too, metaphorically speaking.

Joy and Jubilee were best friends. When Joy started wearing black and spiky accessories, Jubilee also started experimenting with her own look, finding herself most comfortable in dark oversized t-shirts and a grungy aesthetic. At first their mother did the whole pearl-clutching act, as though the world would end if her daughters expressed themselves, and their father dismissed it as a phase. But their Great Aunt Harmony and Great Uncle Herald spoke up on their behalf, entreating them to let their daughters be themselves. Ivy and Gerald finally settled on a plan of inaction; they would simply ignore their daughters' ""shocking"" fashion choices. The girls were happy enough with that, at least it meant they stopped nagging.

As time passed the household grew smaller, with their Great Aunt passing away, then their Great Uncle, eventually their father passed away too, and finally their mother. Of course, this happened over decades, not all at once. By this time the girls were adults, and the freedom to be themselves was wonderful. They ate whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted. They slept whenever they wanted, they partied whenever they wanted, they read and danced and made art whenever they wanted to. They enjoyed cooking for each other, and baking desserts together, laughing and playfully fighting over who got to lick the mixing spoon.

Morgan Richard, the new Father Winter, was the perfect addition to their lives. He'd ""gone into the family business"", but hated the outfit and the persona he had to enact on the job. When he came down their chimney the first time, he couldn't resist joining their household and throwing off the shackles of employment. He shaved off the ridiculous beard and dyed his hair back to black, styling it into a magnificent mohawk. He put his piercings back in, and threw his heavy old ""Father Winter"" coat in the closet, donning his preferred punk attire.

The trio had a wonderful time, just enjoying the simplicity of life and true freedom together in their basalt tomb.

***11. Krampus Winters***

When Joy gave birth to a son, it caused a lot of consternation. For the past two centuries or so, her family had been having daughters, and marrying Father Winters. It seemed a very strange thing to them all now, as they realised it was perhaps a little bit creepy. But Joy had had a son, and had no intentions of going through pregnancy again. What would her son do as an adult, alone in the house, when his parents and aunt had passed away? Even if he did happen to fall in love with the next Father Winter, they could never have children together. The family line would end, and poor little Krampus would almost certainly be doomed to a lonely existence.

Morgan broached an idea; little Krampus should become a Father Winter, thus enabling him to travel through the fireplaces. He would never need to be lonely. It was the only solution, even though it meant he wouldn't be allowed to choose his own destiny - his mother and aunt would be taking away his freedom and controlling his life, the same way their parents had tried to do with them. With great dismay, the women agreed. It was the best chance they could give little Krampus.

And so they enacted their plan. Years passed, and eventually the time came to say goodbye. The elderly Joy and Morgan had tearful smiles as they watched their son climb into the fireplace and disappear from their lives. With some sadness, but knowing they did the right thing, they felt a great weight lifted from their shoulders. They were finally ready to leave this mortal coil. They passed away in each other's arms, with peace in their hearts and a gentle smile on their faces.",1,1735524682.0,u_HereToAdult,1,1.0,False

It’s a great maker but you have to put some initial time in to get right. I’ve read so many posted from members who are disappointed with their Moccamaster. Words like “underwhelmed” and  “overhyped” popping up consistently but they also don’t give us all info we need to help you. Some have put in the work and are still disappointed. If you are moving up from a Cuisinart it is a whole new tasting experience. 

So this is what coffee taste like…

Here is what has worked for me and it took me like 5 pots to dial it in.

Get a scale. Amazon sells good ones for less than $25. Weight your beans and water. The markings on the water tank are off a bit.

Grind a bit coarser than medium. I grind at 10 with my Oxo grinder. I’m getting good results with the Oxo but I’m eyeing a Ode 2 or Eureka grinder.

Brew time is important too. I shoot for 4:30 - 5mins. I like a 1:17 ratio. Nice calculator below.

https://goodcalculators.com/coffee-to-water-ratio-calculator/

Beans can make a big difference. DD is a decent bean but I have found fresh roasted beans from my local specialty coffee shops to be superior. You really can taste difference in body and strength that never came through with the Cuisinart.

I can almost guarantee you will be successful if you apply my methods and other tips that you gather from other members.

I'm from the Midwest originally, so I'm extroverted, was taught manners, and just genuinely go with the flow.

In SF, I consistently went on dates with people I clicked with—whether from the apps, meeting women while walking in the park, coffee shops, art classes, restaurants, bars (note: I don't drink), and heck even the grocery store.

In Chatt, it's been the complete opposite. I get matches on the apps, but most don't reply after the initial connection. The women I have approached in person (twenty or so) are either married, have a boyfriend, or are recently divorced and aren't interested in dating at the moment.

Of the dates I've gone on, most have been with women who are religious and want their partner to be just as religious as they are (I'm agnostic), or women who don't want kids (I do at some point), or women that don't have their life together (no job, minimum wage job, no life goals...etc.)

I'm looking for a girlfriend who ends up being my best friend, and eventual wife. I'm hoping you Redditors, have tips for where I might find her in/around Chatt.

To speed up the inevitable google-stalking, here's my LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinbeveridge/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinbeveridge/)

I was fantasizing about us hanging out and dating. She resigned, I took the opportunity to give her my number and she reacted really well and agreed to go out for coffee. She gave me her number, and she left me a Christmas present on my desk in her last day. Fast forward, she ghosted me. My limmerece was really bad I cried a lot, it took me months to recover. My limmerece continued even though we were NC for 5 months.

This year I have another LO. She is my doctor, I have a chronic condition and I see her multiple times a year. This is even harder. I don't know how I developed this so fast, but the fantasies is keeping her alive in my head, it is harder to recover. I think she is married and that makes me feel worse.

My boyfriend and I are heading to Hawaii for the first time in mid-January. I previously posted our itinerary for our first 5 nights in Oahu and got some great feedback, so now I'm looking for advice on our Big Island portion. I'm trying to balance seeing the sights with some relaxation time, especially because our Oahu days are pretty packed. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

  
Arrival Day:

Land around 1 PM, pick up rental car and drive to Kona

Hit up a grocery story (any recommendations?) for a few things

Dinner in the Kona area (would love suggestions for restaurants, nothing super expensive)

  
Day 1:

Drive up to beaches on the Kohala Coast (suggestions for good swimming beaches in the winter?)

Spend the day relaxing on the sand!

If feeling up for it, may go to Mauna Kea Resort for drinks in hopes of spotting manta rays (we are not doing a night snorkel)

  
Day 2:

Fairwind Snorkel Cruise booked in the morning

Optional things to do after: Greenwell Coffee Farm or Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park

  
Day 3: 

Big day trip! Taking the southern route to Volcanoes National Park, stopping at Punalu'u Bake Shop and Punalu’u Black Sand Beach along the way

What are the must-dos in the park? Chain of Craters Road? Lava tubes? We'd be up for an easy hike.

I'm guessing this will take most of the day and we'll head right back after the park, but if we have time we'll stop at either Rainbow Falls or Akaka Falls before heading back. Is there a better choice?

  
Day 4:

No definite plans, perhaps heading back to beaches to relax after our big driving day. Any other must dos?

  
Day 5/Departure Day:

Our flight doesn't leave until 8:45 PM. I booked our accommodations for an extra night, so we won't have to drive around with luggage in the car. Ideas for what to do this last day?",1,1735524051.0,VisitingHawaii,4,1.0,False

**""The Cryptid Plant Collector’s Guide to Not Dying Horribly""

---

You know, when I left the city and moved into a remote cabin in the woods, I thought my life was going to be peaceful.  

Chop some firewood. Read some dusty plant books. Maybe write angry letters to the editor of gardening magazines.**  

Instead, I’m now the proud caretaker of a sentient rose bush with attachment issues, glowing mushrooms that insult me, and a vine that screams louder than my neighbor’s divorce attorney.**  

But I guess life has a way of keeping things interesting.  

---

 CHAPTER 1 – *The Screaming Vine of West Hollow*  

Let me set the scene for you.  

I’m thirty-five, single, and live in a cabin I inherited from my great-uncle who mysteriously vanished into the woods.  
He left behind two things:  
1. **A library full of bizarre plant journals.**  
2. **An outhouse that leans so far to the left it could double as modern art.**  

People always ask why I never moved back to the city.  

I could say it’s the fresh air or the solitude… but honestly? It’s because **the plants here are more interesting than people.**  

I used to be a botanist. One of those guys who spent more time hunched over microscopes and mislabeling terrariums than socializing. I even wrote a thesis once: **“The Effects of Humidity on Fungal Growth in Controlled Spaces.”**  

**Riveting stuff, right?**  

So when I stumbled on that vine in West Hollow, you’d think I’d have handled it like a professional.  

Instead, I screamed louder than it did.  

Now, here’s the thing. I don’t scare easy. I’ve camped next to bears, got chased by an elk during mating season (that’s a long story), and once mistook a beehive for an abandoned birdhouse.  

But **plants aren’t supposed to shriek.**  

I brought the vine home, naturally. What else was I supposed to do? Leave it there? It was **clearly upset** and honestly… I related.  

I named it **Harold.**  

---

 CHAPTER 2 – *The Fungal Cult of Dewpoint Valley*  

Harold the Screaming Vine wasn’t the only weird thing I’ve collected.  

A few weeks after moving in, I stumbled into **Dewpoint Valley.** That’s where I found the mushrooms.  

Now, before you say it—no, I wasn’t hallucinating. I’ve only tried *psychedelic fungi* once in college, and I spent six hours convinced my RA was a tree.  

The mushrooms in Dewpoint Valley were different.  

They **glowed.**  

Not softly like bioluminescent fungi. **They flared up whenever I insulted them.**  

The first time I found them, I knelt down, poked one with a stick, and said:  

“You’re ugly.”  

**It turned neon green.**  

“Stumpy.”  
**Brighter.**  

“Disappointment.”  
**Blinding.**  

At that point, I couldn’t tell if I was a scientist or **a life coach for emotionally sensitive mushrooms.**  

But I brought them home too.  

They live in my bathroom now. I named them **The Glare Gang.**  
Whenever I stub my toe on the sink, they pulse bright orange in sympathy.  

---

 CHAPTER 3 – *Personal Life? Never Heard of It*  

Now, I know what you’re thinking.  

“Surely a man who collects cryptid plants has hobbies outside of gardening.”  

**Incorrect.**  

I tried dating once.  

Took a woman out for dinner at that Italian place in town, the one with the garlic bread that could probably revive the dead. I thought things were going well until she asked about my job.  

“So, you’re a botanist?” she said.  

“Sort of,” I replied. “I, uh… hunt cryptid plants.”  

She laughed. I didn’t.  

The date ended early when I accidentally mentioned **the rose bush that growls when I don’t water it.**  

Turns out “I collect haunted plants” isn’t the dating flex I thought it was.  

So yeah. It’s just me, **Harold the vine,** and **the Glare Gang.**  

And I guess that’s fine.  

Who needs romance when you’ve got **a fanged rose that leaves thorns shaped like hearts** on your doorstep?  

---

 CHAPTER 4 – *The Fanged Rose and the Neighbor’s Cat*  

Let’s talk about **Valentine.**  

Valentine is **the Fanged Rose** that grows just outside my shed. She appeared one day, fully grown, in a place where I swear no plant had ever existed before.  

Her petals are blood red. Her thorns can pierce leather gloves. And when I prune her too aggressively, she **hisses.

I named her Valentine because:  
1. She’s sharp, beautiful, and wants me dead.**  
2. It felt appropriate.**  

Last fall, I caught Valentine interacting with the neighbor’s cat.  

Now, the cat (Mr. Pickles) is **terrifying.** He once stole an entire rotisserie chicken off my kitchen counter and left no trace.  

When I spotted him sitting nose-to-petals with Valentine, I thought I was about to witness **a supernatural showdown.**  

Instead, Valentine… **curled her vines around him.**  

Mr. Pickles purred.  

I stood there for ten minutes wondering if I was hallucinating or if I needed to start charging admission to **The Cryptid Cat Café.

---

 CHAPTER 5 – *A Day in the Life of the Cryptid Plant Guy*  

Most mornings, I wake up early. Not because I’m disciplined—**Harold wraps around my foot until I trip out of bed.

I make coffee, feed the plants (because, yes, they expect breakfast), and spend the day hiking, documenting new cryptid flora.  

Last week, I found a mushroom that hums like a broken speaker.** I named it Greg. Greg hums louder when it rains.  

Afternoons are spent journaling—mostly notes like:  
- **“Don’t step near the pond; the water lilies bite.”**  
- **“The tree stump by the fence is whispering again.

By evening, I sit on the porch. Valentine curls by the steps, Harold hums softly in the wind, and the Glare Gang pulses from the window like a low-budget disco.  

It’s not a glamorous life.  

But it’s mine.  

And honestly?  

I wouldn’t trade it for anything.









New start.


CHAPTER 6 – *The Fern That Fixes Hangovers* 

You know how people say nature heals?  

They’re not wrong.  

I woke up last Saturday with the kind of headache that makes you question your entire life. I wasn’t even drinking—**Valentine accidentally punctured a beer can near my window, and I inhaled whatever fumes drifted inside.**  

Don’t ask. It’s a long story involving me, a raccoon, and a dare to see if cryptid flora responds to alcohol. Spoiler: They do.  

Anyway, I stumbled into the woods, hoping the fresh air would help. That’s when I found **The Hangover Fern.

It was small, growing by the creek—**leaves shaped like delicate little hands** that drooped toward the water. When I crouched next to it, the fern **lifted slightly,** like it was reaching toward me.  

I narrowed my eyes. “Are you trying to help or just messing with me?”  

The fern rustled gently in response.  

I took a chance and rubbed one of the leaves between my fingers. It smelled faintly of mint and something else—**the kind of clean, sharp scent you only find in fancy spas that charge too much for cucumber water.**  

Ten minutes later, my headache was gone.  

So now I have **an anti-hangover fern growing on my kitchen counter.**  

I’ve named it **Fernando.

Fernando thrives on jazz music and sunlight. If I forget to water him, he droops dramatically until I apologize out loud.  

Honestly, I respect the commitment.  

---  

**CHAPTER 7 – *The Lantern Bloom and Why I Don’t Need Flashlights Anymore

A lot of people underestimate the woods at night.  

Sure, it’s peaceful during the day, but after sunset? **The entire forest turns into something else.

Sounds carry differently. Tree branches stretch in ways that don’t seem physically possible. And if you wander too far without light, **you’re probably not coming back.

That’s how I found **The Lantern Bloom.**  

I’d gone out for a night walk, mostly to check on the Glare Gang (they like moonlight, believe it or not), when I saw something flickering by the riverbank.  

It looked like a flower—**soft golden petals glowing faintly in the dark.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the moon, but when I got closer, the bloom **brightened.**  

It wasn’t until I brushed a hand against the petals that I realized what it really was.  

The damn thing **followed me home.

Now I have a **sentient light source** sitting in a ceramic pot on my porch. When I go for walks at night, it **drifts behind me, hovering gently like a balloon.**  

I call it **Lumi.

Lumi flickers brighter when I say dumb things, which—according to my plants—happens more often than I’d like to admit.  

But it’s comforting. Nothing sneaks up on you when you’re being followed by a floating flower that glows like a lantern from a Studio Ghibli movie.  

---  

**CHAPTER 8 – *The Tea Leaves of Slightly Questionable Insight* 

I’m not a tea person. I’ve always been more of a coffee guy—strong, black, and capable of jump-starting a car if necessary.  

But one evening, while hiking up by the old quarry, I found a bush covered in **delicate silver leaves that shimmered under the moonlight.**  

Naturally, I plucked a few and brewed them.  

Because that’s what you do when you find random magical plants in the wild, right?  

**Bad idea.**  

The tea didn’t just taste good. **It gave me visions.

The first time I drank it, I saw my neighbor’s cat (Mr. Pickles, the rotisserie chicken thief) **leading a parade of frogs through my backyard.** I thought it was a hallucination.  

It wasn’t.  

When I checked later, there were **tiny muddy footprints everywhere.

Now I make tea whenever I’m about to do something stupid. Lumi usually flickers in warning when I grab the kettle.  

It doesn’t stop me, but I appreciate the effort.  

---  

**CHAPTER 9 – *The Whispering Clover That Definitely Knows Too Much* 

Some plants **shouldn’t talk.

I found **The Whispering Clover** tucked beneath a log near my cabin. It looked normal—just a patch of soft green leaves—until I stepped on it by accident.  

“**Excuse you.**”  

I jumped about three feet in the air.  

The clover **sassed me.**  

I knelt down, carefully brushing the leaves aside. “Sorry. I didn’t realize you were, uh… conscious.”  

The clover rustled softly. “**Clearly.**”  

I dug it up, transplanted it to a pot, and now it sits on my windowsill **judging me every morning.**  

“**Is that really what you’re wearing?**”  
“**Maybe don’t put that much butter on your toast.**”  
“**You forgot to water Fernando.**”  

I’d throw it out, but honestly? **It’s the most useful plant I own.**  

---  

**CHAPTER 10 – *The Foxglove That Steals Shoes* 

I didn’t know foxgloves could steal things.  

Apparently, **cryptid ones can.**  

I first noticed the issue when I couldn’t find my boots. I looked everywhere—under the bed, behind the couch, even in the fridge (don’t ask).  

Eventually, I spotted **a bright purple foxglove** swaying near the edge of my property, **wearing one of my shoes.**  

Yes. **Wearing it.**  

I approached cautiously, holding out my hand. “Hey. I need that.”  

The foxglove **bounced away** like I’d personally offended it.  

It took two hours and an entire loaf of bread to bribe it into giving the shoe back.  

Now the foxglove (named **Foxy** because I lack creativity) has its own pile of “treasures” near the shed.  

Sometimes, I leave out shiny things just to keep it happy.  

I don’t know what happens if you make a cryptid foxglove angry, and frankly, I don’t want to find out.  

---  

At this point, I’ve accepted that my life is… unconventional.  

Some people collect rare coins. Others collect art.  

Me?  

**I collect sentient plants with questionable morals.**  ",1,1735524008.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

My son is 7 months old. I took meds my entire pregnancy and then once I went back to work. I stopped because I’m an over-supplier and didn’t want all the extra milk to go to waste. I was comfortable taking it while breastfeeding my full term and healthy child especially since I took it while pregnant but I wasn’t comfortable donating it to babies that were preterm and/or medically fragile even if I could disclose it to the parents and everything. So I just stopped. I drank caffeine instead (I work in a coffee shop) and that’s okay for work since I’m only part time and I’ve been doing the same thing for so long. 

I had forgotten and underestimated how bad my ADHD was. I had been medicated for 5 years prior. I forgot how hard it was to do literally anything.

I’m really trying to make it to a year and then start reducing my supply. My son rarely takes a bottle so I have no use for the milk aside from donating it.

She stated that she's happily single and not looking for anyone but at the same time feels like that she has gotten maybe too combfortable and should put herself out there more.

I upgraded my previous set up to a Breville Bamnino Plus and a fellow Opus Grinder over the holidays and am having the hardest time dialing in my espresso.

Taste: flat flavor to start, sour at the end

Roast Date: 12/3

Roaster: Grand Coffee, Las Pilas

Roast Level: medium roast

Bean Details: this is from their site, I'm not that well versed: ""blend of two premium lots of coffee from farmers in Jalapa and Huehuetenango, Guatemala""

Opus Grind Size: 2.75

Dose: 18g

Yield: 36g

Time: espresso begins pouring at 12s and ends at 30s. I've been manually using my bambino by ""pre-infusing"" my shot for 8s, by holding the button down for 8s. TBH I'm not even sure if that is the right thing to do, but otherwise the automatic setting doesn't appear to yield enough an output.

Work flow: At a 2.75 Grind size, I grind enough for 18g of espresso for a doubleshot, dual wall, 54mm portafilter. I tamp down the espresso as evenly as possible. And then once it's ready to go, I insert the portafilter, and to start, I hold down the doubleshot button until about 8 seconds, let go, then the espresso shot begins to pour around 12 seconds and I manually stop the machine at 30 seconds.

I'm thinking I need to grind finer and or perhaps add more water to get close to 40g of espresso output but would love to see what you all think, thank you!!!",2,1735523543.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1hpbyne,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1hpbyne/do_i_have_endometriosis/,Do I have endometriosis? ,"Hi guys, I'm a 17 year old girl and I've had constipation my whole life. I usually go like 2x a week, and this is the best it's been in my life. I've tried different things but each time my tolerance gets stronger and I have to move on to something stronger. I'm constantly in either discomfort or pain but there's not much I can do. My stomach is always bloated, my ribs are distended, and I got my period when I was 11-ish. 

The first few years of my periods were really heavy, then they kind of whittled down and now I really don't know what to expect. Usually the first two days are really heavy, and I get cramps. But after that, my period is much lighter. 

Tbh it feels silly to call them ""cramps"", it feels like I'm being killed. I didn't always get cramps, but now I always do, but only on the first day, not on the next. There's no moderation either, just like my uterus is being knifed out and ripped apart for an hour or two, it wakes me up at night, hurts so bad I cant move or speak. I can always always feel it in my thighs, butt, and lower abdomen. I just lay in bed shivering and sweating and feeling like I'm going to faint. 

I don't know why but I always take a colofac and I feel like it works but it takes about an hour or so to feel the effects. Usually a bowel movement would help me, and it's easier to pass stool on my period, but last week my cramps woke me up and they were just as bad. I took a colofac and a hot water bottle but nothing worked for an hour. I don't know if this is a symptom but after the pain went I cried for my mother for like an hour. And I've had period pain this bad before but I don't get so emotional after it. All my sisters and my mom have period issues (not like mine) but doctors don't do anything despite my father being a doctor himself. 

I'm constipated but I also have acid reflux, I frequently have trapped wind and feel nauseous. I'm 43kg 5'2 and I have had iron deficiency for a few years. I usually have oatmeal for breakfast, two other meals (could be healthy or unhealthy), and I usually have 12-16 hours between dinner and tomorrow's breakfast. I take coffee every third day, as I have tried taking it everyday but my stool is always very little and it doesn't feel as if I've emptied my bowels. I try to get in 8,000 steps a day, but I'm not very active. I drink 4-5 glasses of water daily. I've been in pain during my periods for years. 

I had a phase in my life where before I would get my period, I would get these intense headaches that could last days. Literal worst pain in my life, thought about putting a gun to my head. I went to a children's hospital where they said they were probably migraines, but most of the time it was a mix between a cluster headache and migraine. Other times it was a migraine with aura, and sometimes a headache came on suddenly and strongly that wasn't like anything I've had before. Vomiting would help me loads, and I'd increase my chance of getting a migraine if I slept late. They happened almost monthly and it would hurt too much to cry or move a muscle. They started when I was 11, ending when I was 13. MRI done with innocuous cyst found in subarachnoid space. Never had one since thank God. 

Only once did my headache coincide with my period, I had a striking hot fever, nausea but unable to vomit. This doesnt happen always but sometimes when I have a fever, I get this tingling and heavy pressing sensation starting from my arms/legs to my fingers/toes. It causes my fingers to bend upwards like a 90° angle, my tumb folds in my palm and my toes cramp. My limbs just go cold but my forehead is still hot. Then the heavy pressure on my wrists increases like there is a weight being dropped on them, and I lose all control and feeling in my limbs, until the two sensations meet in my stomach, reach their worst and fizzle out. It feels like paralysis, I've tried hitting my hand against the bedframe and felt nothing. That time I had this exact thing happen and then I got my period a moment later. Fever usually lasts 3 days but cramping fizzles out immediately. Usually feel nauseous and out of breath. I've also never been diagnosed with any other deficiency or illness.

I'm sorry I've typed out this tedious essay, but I just am curious if anyone else has experienced similar things in their life and has been diagnosed with endometriosis. Sorry for TMI !!! ",1,1735523361.0,endometriosis,0,1.0,False

She likes scrambled eggs with tiny bit of butter in the morning, also pancakes, but mix in a healthy stuff if you can. She'll complain that you're making her gain weight but will love you for it nonetheless. Anyway, cook for her when you can.

She will talk back a lot, gets defensive most of the times. She does because she had to grow up and fend for herself at young age. Her parents separated when she was young. 

When she's having anxiety attacks, make sure to hold her and tell her, you're there with her. She might take a few trips in the toilet during those times. Make sure to fart in front of her first, it will take a lot of guts if you're shy but it will really help her. 

When she gets overwhelmed with emotions, she tend to go in her own world. She will either play Sims (if you're lucky, you will have an avatar there and you will have a simulated relationship with her avatar, don't judge her for that), her favorite movie is Shrek and she knows all the dialogue in French and have it memorised (You'll see her watch the movie series a lot of times), she also loves FRIENDS TV show... both in English and French... Movies and Shows are her escape from reality. Be supportive.

She has a doudou, a cloth from when she was young, make sure to keep it from being lost and that it's always with her when she makes trips, it calms her during the night and helps her sleep. She may or may not forget to wash it so help her wash it when she doesn't have time, ask her beforehand if its okay to wash it. 

She can be a bit of loner and might people please at times then she'll forget to take care of herself, be there for her when this happen, listen to her first and do try to understand her point of view, don't say anything until she's done talking. She will appreciate it. 

When you're at a crossroads and having disagreements, be her friend and understand her point of view and ask her for the same when you want your side heard. It gets easier to work around things after that. 

She likes her board and card games. Get her one, if not, get her 5 dices, a pen and paper 😉 she'll beat you on most games she know, especially mario karts and if you're too good do let her claim victory when she's having a bad day, it will cheer her up. 

Tea... make sure to offer her tea whenever you can. She likes tea and prefers them over coffee. 

She likes to drink but make sure she doesn't drink a lot, she gets stomach problems after that. 

Make sure you always have toilet papers or she will start stealing them from her work 😂

Her oldest younger brother has a lot of allergies so make sure to ask her if you want to gift/buy him snacks. He likes Animé, he does art, sport and gaming. You two will get along if you have atleast one in common. She has another younger brother and a little sister. The little sister is into horoscopes so do entertain her curiosity when she asks for your date of birth. The youngest brother is like a little puppy on caffeine, make sure he doesn't hurt himself. 

The rest are for you to navigate but it will be worthwhile. 

I loved her when I was in your position and I still have love for her and I wish her the best in life. I'm an old news, you don't need to worry about me and you probably won't hear about me. Do your best to love her honestly and earnestly. I wish you both all the best and loving relationship.

1hpbwt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costa/comments/1hpbwt4/how_screwed_am_i_after_my_first_shift/,How screwed am I after my first shift?,"I was recently offered a barista job at costa (with no prior work experience, let alone as a barista)- my manager specifically said in the interview that normally they do a trial shift, but that he didn’t see that as necessary and was just going to start with an orientation shift.

Well my orientation shift was the day before yesterday, and… it definitely could have gone better! I’m normally quite quick to pick things up, but even simple things like steaming the milk right took me way more attempts to learn than they really should have. My manager seems like a lovely guy, but he’s very passionate about his job and I legitimately can’t tell how much patience he has for people who are learning/less good at making coffee. 

I thought this orientation shift was from 6:30am-12pm, but at around 8:30am he told me that my shift was done. I assumed I’d just made a mistake- he told me the details of my orientation shift at the interview when I was already holding a lot of info in my head and didn’t follow up in writing- cool, whatever. But my second ‘red flag’ came after I left, and I got a call from him telling me I needed to return the uniform he gave me. Like I said, I don’t know how coffee shops normally operate, but it seems… highly unlikely that the store just holds onto all the employees’ uniforms. 

He said he’d be in contact about my next shift but I haven’t heard from him (not that that by itself is especially concerning)- am I about to get ghosted? We haven’t signed any paperwork yet so if he wanted to bin me now would be the ideal time to do it, and honestly I wouldn’t blame him! I’m still somewhat hopeful - mainly because I reckon the store really needs workers and/or there were no other applicants (it seems unlikely that he’d hire someone with no work experience on the spot without a trial shift for any other reason!), but the uniform thing in particular is making me worry.

About me: I'm 28, male I love to run, travel, ski/snowboard, fish, and just about every outdoor activity you can think of. I co-founded a software company in the real estate space, so I work a lot—probably too much. I'm from the Midwest originally, so I'm extroverted, was taught manners, and just genuinely go with the flow.

In SF, I consistently went on dates with people I clicked with—whether from the apps, meeting women while walking in the park, coffee shops, art classes, restaurants, bars (note: I don't drink), and heck even the grocery store.

In Chatt, it's been the complete opposite. I get matches on the apps, but most don't reply after the initial connection. The women I have approached in person (twenty or so) are either married, have a boyfriend, or are recently divorced and aren't interested in dating at the moment.

Of the dates I've gone on, most have been with women who are religious and want their partner to be just as religious as they are (I'm agnostic), or women who don't want kids (I do at some point), or women that don't have their life together (no job, minimum wage job, no life goals...etc.)

I'm looking for a girlfriend who ends up being my best friend, and eventual wife. I'm hoping you Redditors, have tips for where I might find her in/around Chatt.

Spending any time X, IG or Reddit, you’ll see disheartening statements regarding how inept the medical and scientific communities are at preventing and treating disease in the U.S. 

There is no shortage of criticism against every single stakeholder in the current system, from insurance companies, PBM and pharmacies, to physicians / clinicians and hospitals to pharmaceutical / device companies, to NIH /private funding, quality of science, scientific methods, and scientific journal gatekeeping.

This criticism is necessary and useful in keeping all parties in check, avoiding fraud or inaccuracies, and promoting the best, most authentic output. I appreciate folks for being vocal and providing feedback and criticism - no system is perfect and like any operating system, the bugs and errors need to be sorted to optimize future iterations. 

I will not delve into the complexities of overhauling the health insurance system in the U.S., nor will I weigh in on subsidized or universal healthcare proposals—that is a separate discussion. Instead, I prefer to focus on a set of First Principles: How do we define and promote “good health”? How do we prevent, detect, and treat disease? And how do we discern the true nature of the human body from scientific errors?

I’ve spend my entire adult life studying human health and disease and ultimately developed a large practice as a cardiologist. I deeply love what I do. I enjoy counseling patients on diet and exercise, educating them on their cardiac conditions, preventing disease, detecting disease, and all of the scope of care that cardiology allows me to do for people. I spend much of my free time reading journal publications or attending conferences to stay up to date on the science. I’m fascinated by the human body, its immense complexity, and its only partially known internal working code and mechanisms.



Here are the First Principles as I see them:

1. **Genetics is, and always will, play a critical role in affecting our health both as a species and during our individual lifetime (please read further before assuming this is a nature vs nurture statement).** I remain profoundly humbled by the millions of years of evolution and natural selection that has shaped our current genome, epigenome, and psychosocial milieu. This is the underlying code of our “software”.  Although our Homo sapiens genome has undergone mutation, genetic drift, and selection over the past hundreds of thousands of years, it structurally and functionally has remained largely the same. There is some variation however on an individual level. Our newborns will have a small number of random and unique mutations as part of the natural error process of DNA replication. Some will also inherit DNA mutations/variants or chromosomal abnormalities from their parents. All of us will acquire somatic gene mutations during our lifetime from carcinogenesis / DNA damage or from the error process of replication. In some of these instances, there are clear gene mutations/variants or chromosomal variants that are shown to correlate with disease —e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell, Tay-Sachs, Huntington’s, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 13, trisomy 18, Turner syndrome, Cri du chat syndrome, DiGeorge, Williams, etc. In other instances, gene variants/mutations do not necessarily lead to harm or disease, or if they do, they show incomplete penetrance—such as with Lynch syndrome, hemochromatosis, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
   1. **But we have so much more to learn.**
      1. We need to **discover more genetic variants** that are associated with established diseases. This includes sifting through massive genomic datasets and identifying signals for gene variants—SNPs, insertions, deletions, repeat expansions, nonsense mutations, etc.—that lead to disease. We need to accelerate technology (including AI) to help us analyze these massive databases, project simulated models, and predict which gene variants play disease-affecting roles. 
      2. We need to **develop genetic-based tools to screen** individuals and populations for high-impact variants (e.g., newborn screening, polygenic risk scores, hereditary cancer syndromes). Many of the screens can take place in-utero or in the newborn to quickly enact targeted therapies, but I foresee future technology to provide a continuous monitoring of DNA variations/mutations throughout one’s lifetime, almost as a measure of how much risk one has accumulated by measure of known disease-promoting genes/variants compared to accumulation of health-promoting genes/variants. 
      3. We need to **develop gene-based therapies** that treat these genetic mutations at the source (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9 or other gene-editing technologies), potentially curing conditions that were once thought to be untreatable. These therapies may be as simple as turning “on” or “off” a gene, or potentially therapies that insert or remove genes. Progress is underway with Sickle Cell. Moreover, we need to understand the implications of silencing or upregularing one gene variant at the expense of other genes in the genome.
      4. We need continue to **study and** **integrate -omics** (e.g., proteomics, metabolomics, etc) to form a more comprehensive picture of how these mutations manifest in real-world disease and how best to target them. Google’s AlphaFold is an example of this. How can certain protein shapes and configuration affect other proteins or receptors in the body?  This will help us to develop novel proteins and drugs which target these proteins and receptors.
      5. **Epigenetics has also become increasingly impactful on human disease.** DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs can modulate gene expression. External factors (nutrition, toxins, early-life stress) can alter these epigenetic marks. Understanding these changes is key to developing more precise prevention and treatment strategies, and allows us to modify some “nurture” into our inherent “nature”.
      6. **We need to discover genes which promote health in already healthy individuals**. Some people truly are lucky in their genetic lottery. Their genes prove to be seemingly resistant against detrimental DNA damage, lipid metabolism, neurodegeneration, etc. These are the lifelong smokers with no significant coronary plaque or lung cancer at the age of 90. These are the collection of gene variants which predispose to less disease, less obesity, less cancer, less ASCVD, and less diabetes despite sometimes very unhealthy lifestyles. Gene variants which lead to less DNA replication errors, earlier satiety, deeper sleep, improved muscle mass, improved fat metabolism, improved insulin sensitivity, and any and all markers of human quality of life. As a use case example I think this also plays a role in obesity. I think many people attribute obesity to a strictly behavioral problem, when the reality is it is incredibly likely that many obese people also possess any number of gene variants which alter their satiety, insulin responsiveness, cholesterol metabolism, neurotransmitter response to food intake, etc and lead them to an uphill battle despite the strictest of diet and exercise routines. The reality is most of our human genome has evolved to reward overconsuming - sugar, fat, calories, etc all trigger immense positive feedback neurotransmitter loops. The abundance of food and immediate availability in modern world, although is positive evolution of our intelligence, has become counter-evolutionary to our bodies.  Yet when we try to combat this, I believe it is true that one individual’s calorie restricted diet can lead to a significant sense of hunger and craving throughout the day whereas the same magnitude of calorie restriction in another individual can lead to minimal side effects due to the way the body processes the hemostasis of a calorie restriction based on genetic determinants and protein/ neurotransmitter variation.  I think we will discover that there are far more potent genetic underpinnings to addiction or aggressively positive neurotransmitter feedback loops, including food, alcohol and drugs, than previously understood. This is not to negate the essential role of behavioral and psychosocial factors, but rather to highlight that some people are born with variations in their feedback loops for satiety and neurotransmitter responses to addictive substances that make it far easier to succumb to those diseases. The GLP-1 agonist medical therapies (Ozempic, Mounjaro) are a perfect example of this and demonstrate how simply altering one protein receptor in the body can have a profound impact on satiety. Similar statements could be said about exercise and sleep. Why does one individual feel a sense of endorphins-release euphoria with cardiovascular training while another individual does not? Why do some people feel well rested with 4 hours of sleep whereas others need > 8 hours despite similar lifestyle and biometric variables?
2. **The quality of science is essential and critical. Above all else, we need to operate science in the context of epistemology.**
   1. We must ground our research in **rigorous methods**, **transparent data**, **reproducibility**, and **peer review**, recognizing that scientific knowledge evolves over time. Training in academic institutions my whole life, I’ve become disheartened with the amount of “fluff” that is produced. Medical students and researches are taught to publish for the sake of publishing, even if the data is low quality, retrospective or suffers from substantial sampling or statistical errors. This dilutes the quality of authentic, real science.I’ve also become disappointed by some of our RCTs. In cardiology, some of our biggest RCTs where were previously “positive” were later overturned and found to be harmful or neutral due to endpoint manipulation, poor statistical methods, or simply outdated data during a time in which the environment was different. Some example is prophylactic aspirin for primary prevention of ASCVD, recent data surrounding the ticagrelor controversy post PCI, post-MI beta blockers, colchicine, ICD in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, etc. 
   2. **Scientific data should be open access data to maximize collaboration, reproducibility and accountability.** This means that particularly for NIH funded research that there should be no reason to gatekeep raw data if part of a clinical trial and/or research study. Clinical endpoint should be heavily scrutinized. A medication may prove to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, but if all-cause death is not reported or shown to worsen, that needs to be transparent(see recent JAMA: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827168) 
3. **We need to discover more ways in which our lifestyle and environment impact our health.** This extends beyond social media’s obsession with macronutrient profiles of our diet and amount and type of exercise. Frankly, I think our understanding of diet and exercise has relatively plateaued and do not expect much more insight unless new food groups are created. There will always be extremists who tout diets like the carnivore diet, but the reality is most sensible people and the medical community have a reasonable understanding the the Mediterranean/DASH diet or plant based diet are optimal, that saturated fats tend to correlate with worsened lipid profiles, that increased simple carbohydrate loads and sugar intake tends to correlate with insulin resistance, the portion/calorie control is part of moderating weight, etc. The fad diet supporters and/or critiques of  specifics food items (i.e. seed oils) are low yield and low impact efforts in my opinion and do not seriously impact health if the totality of one’s diet is reasonable. But I do think there are unique chemicals, compounds and agents that are probably either not identified or not understood well enough in how they could harm the body. Microplastics right now is an example of one class of agents that is identified but not well understood. It has been found in carotid plaque for individuals receiving CEA, but we do not know its role yet - whether incidental or causal in atherosclerosis. Others classes of agents that need to be better investigated include endocrine-disrupting chemicals, nanoparticles, PFAS, and RF/ EMFs waves. It’s very easy to say they do not play a significant role or factor, but until this is actually tested, and reproduced a a large scale, I think there needs to remain some degree of caution and skepticism.

Help?","I don't know if I have ADHD or anything similar, but I once heard someone mention self medicating for ADHD with caffine and I feel like I can't relate more. But I am unsure if I have ADHD and I feel hesitant to not try other things first and see if maybe I can kick this dependance on caffine.

I do try to measyre how much I have in a day, and atm I only really have: one energy drink a day, 2 cups of coffee a day, or some tea in a day. Some days I only have half an energy drink, a couple cups of tea,ir one cup of coffee. On the rare day I'm super tired (say I had a closing shift followed by an opening shift with only a few hrs of sleep between them) I will max out at say an energy drink and a tea.

It takes me a while to get moving in the morning (generally 2 to 3 hours) unless I have caffine. Even if I feel perfectly rested, I need caffine to actually get out of bed proper. otherwise, I meander around and stare at things I want to do but can't seem to do them. Or I start to do them but I instantly loose focus and will keep losing focus no matter what.

Hell, I will even have days where I do literally nothing all day because I didn't start off with some caffine. Then I work up to maybe a few hours of productivity and then it just dies back down. But with caffine,I can jump start my day ahd be productive like 2 to 3 times as long.

It's like everything I want to do has some kind of innitial energy to then let the dominos fall and let me work on whatever task it is I want to do. Even things like gaming or hobbies take way too much energy. It feels like caffine has become the only thing that helps me do that. It feels like nothing inside me will ever generate energy. I feel more mopey with out it too. But I hate relying on something like that and don't want to lean on the habit.

I am trying to exercise and eat better. I feel better when I do these things. But they don't seem to help evergize me much over all yet. I have tried making myself get out of bed, but then I just stare at things blanky and genuinely cannot focus at all- like focusing takes a long gearing up period.

It does at least seem like being super busy without the option not to helps, as I am made to get up and do something (say, work), and then I come home being able to focus. But I am not sure how to replicate that efficiantly without caffine. (I even drink caffine to go to most early shifts too, so idk maybe that's part of why it helps.)

I also struggle with developing habits, so any advice to also do that helps a lot. Like I can make a habit and keep up a streak for months then miss one day and it instantly breaks. And even things that I do like every day for months at a time are very concious, thoughtful, energy draining decisions that I have to maintain. Examples: showering, brushing teeth, getting my bed ready to go to sleep, exercise. I can of course make and stick to habits, it's just kinda difficult sonetimes.",2,1735521290.0,productivity,3,1.0,False
1hpb94s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicWomen/comments/1hpb94s/having_difficulty_finding_a_parish_to_call_our/,Having difficulty finding a parish to call our home,"My fiancé and I are in our mid/late 30s. He grew up Byzantine rite; I grew up Roman rite. 

We’re both quite conservative and favor traditionalism in the liturgy. We’re also looking for an active parish community with younger families and other 30-somethings.

We’ve both been on a spiritual journey since we got engaged in 2021. We spent two years in the Eastern Orthodox Church before reverting to Catholicism. 

We are currently parishioners at a Roman rite  parish and attend a NO Mass. My fiancé struggles with finding inspiration in the homilies. Some of the priests are better speakers than others (I don’t doubt their faith, I just think some are more straightforward than eloquent). We’ve made friends with another couple at our parish, which has been a blessing. We also joined the KC chapter/women’s auxiliary, but meetings are sparse and us and the other-mentioned couple are the youngest folks in the group. The people in the parish chapter are wonderful, but it would be nice to meet others closer to our age. 

My fiancé recently told me he feels lonely at our parish because 1) Most people leave immediately after Mass ends and there is no social hour (coffee/donuts), and 2) Having grown up in the Byzantine rite, he feels as if the NO Mass is watered down. I can understand why he feels this way especially after I spent time in the Orthodox Church. The Latin Mass is too foreign for him; Divine Liturgy is where he feels most comfortable. The issue for him is that the Byzantine rite community he grew up with has changed significantly. His family was deeply involved in their home parish (two hours away). He hasn’t felt the same sense of community at the local Byzantine parish we visited. There were a lot of converts, which is fantastic, but being new to the faith (and to Catholicism), many of them were hyper-zealous and came across as aloof; there were very few cradle Byzantines left in the church. He says apart from the liturgy, he doesn’t recognize the community any longer. He has been grieving what no longer appears to exist. I know it weighs deeply on his heart. 

I’ve spent a lot of time in prayer asking God to direct us to our spiritual home, but I’m worried my fiancé will never feel 100% at home in any parish (Roman or Byzantine). I can’t imagine the grief he feels every Sunday. Sometimes, he gets very frustrated about it all; I can’t blame him, I’d love a more close-knit parish community too. I’m just struggling to figure out how I can best support him. Ideally, we could rotate going to a different rite (Mass/Divine Liturgy) each Sunday. 

We plan to visit more parishes (including another Eastern rite parish), but I worry about him not feeling happy or spiritually fulfilled anywhere. He can be quite picky. At the same time, I suspect he is being a bit prideful in perhaps expecting too much from a parish; I think things have changed since COVID in both rites. How can I be a better partner to him during this time?

I apologize for rambling. I’m a bit emotional and I’m currently recovering from being sick. Any encouragement or prayers is appreciated. ♥️",6,1735521269.0,CatholicWomen,2,1.0,False
1hpb8km,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hpb8km/why_isnt_the_lagom_casa_more_widely_recommended/,Why isn't the Lagom Casa more widely recommended? Fed up with DF64 Gen 2 and this seems...perfect?,"I'm fed up with my DF64 Gen 2 and have been looking into alternatives. Lots of grinders get recommended but the more I look at the Casa the more a) it seems perfect for me and b) surprised I am that it isn't a more widely recommended grinder. 

Context: I mostly drink light roast pourovers, and love my ZP6 for that. I do espresso a lot too though, and my wife drinks espresso daily. Mostly light roast but we dabble in a bit of everything. I use the JX-Pro and prefer it to the DF, but she uses the DF for convenience. We cycle through a lot of beans from around the world at any given time, so have to change settings daily.

So here's what matters to me and why I'm thinking about making the switch:

Build quality & engineering: The rubber feet and wave spring on the DF64 are awful design. So much room for inconsistency. I have many other complaints but this isn't a DF64 rant thread. Basically the build and engineering annoy me so much that I avoid using it. Option-O seems like the polar opposite of DF engineering, and I like nicely made things.

Consistency: on the DF, I can get decent consistency if I don't change grind settings. Problem is, I switch between different beans and brew methods all the time. So if I go from 10 to 50 back to 10, often that 10 will behave like 12. And yes, I do it with the grinder running, go past 10, and then adjust back, to ensure the burrs are tightly seated in the rubber. Opening it up to clean it will change both my zero point and calibration. The Casa should be more consistent in grind settings and retaining calibration after cleaning.

Cleanliness and retention: the Casa seems like one of the cleanest grinders out there. The DF64 is messy. Bellows is necessary given the poor chute and declumper design, but every time I do it, fines and chaff go everywhere.

Taste: I don't really care about conical vs flat. Tried enough coffee from different grinders to understand that it's a red herring. The Mizen profile from Option-O sounds really nice and versatile, and even though it will mostly be for espresso, I think I would enjoy something different from my ZP6 for pourover with certain beans. Right now my DF doesn't give ""different"", it just gives ""worse"" for pourover.

I don't mind spending a lot more money if necessary, say on a P64 or Zerno, but the Casa seems absolutely perfect. I don't care about grind speed. The price also seems like an absolute bargain for an Option-O. Am I crazy? Any reason I shouldn't pull the trigger? Why isn't this the most widely recommended sub-$500 grinder?

Long Post.

Hello there, fellow long-haulers. I wanted to post about my experience as I read that many people are still struggling with the same issues I have experienced, and to a degree, I still do.

This is by no means medical advice, so please don't take it as a treatment protocol. Also, this is what I have done and worked for me. Consider that every condition, body, and situation is different.

Let me start with a little bit of backstory.

I am a 40 y/o male based in Sydney, Australia with no major health issues prior to the pandemic.

I got my first shot of Pf in August 2021. No issues after the first shot. 4 weeks later I got my second dose of the same brand. The venue was different, closer to home so I biked there and back. Unsure if the exercise right after had any effects or impact.

One week after the second dose I woke up in the middle of the night with tachycardia which lasted until noon the following day.

I had a week of no symptoms and had another episode of tachycardia one week after and one more one week after that. Always on a wed. From there on, I had no symptoms for 3 weeks.

3 weeks after I had my first bad episode of chest pains, tachycardia, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing and multiple symptoms.

Between then and June this year I visited the Emergency department close to 30 times with chest pains, tachycardia and so many other symptoms. I tested positive for COVID 3 times, 2 RATs and one blood test with high COVID protein count.

At my lowest point, I struggled to breathe. Taking a few steps would cause a spiking high heart rate, fluctuating blood pressure and trouble breathing. I had trouble getting up and usually, the mornings would be the most challenging with extreme exhaustion, chest pains, tachycardia and headaches/head spinning.

In addition to the doctors in ED and my regular GP, I consulted with 2 more GPs, a rheumatologist, a respiratory specialist, a gastroenterologist, a naturopath, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a neurologist, a chiropractor, an acupuncturist and a physiotherapist.

I have done a CT scan of the coronary arteries and lungs, an MRI of the heart, the brain and spine, the chest wall, multiple ultrasounds of the heart and chest wall, multiple x-rays of the chest and heart, blood tests, sleep apnea studies and still pending follow-ups with multiple doctors.

Out of all the studies and tests, there were a few discoveries:

* spike protein of over 20,000 and positive nucleocapsid protein
* positive autoantibody at a titre of 1:160
* very high sensitisation to dust mites and grass mix
* small amounts of plaque in the arteries

These are the prescribed treatments I have done:

* 4 months of colchicine starting in November 2021. Initially, 2 pills a day for a month, followed by 1 pill a day for the rest of the treatment. 
* 10 days course of oral steroids, 5 days of 50mg followed by 5 days of 25mg in June 2024
* 2 antihistaminics taken one in the morning, off the counter and one at night, prescribed, starting in June 2024. I will take them until the doctor tells me to stop
* SSRIs:  50mg prescribed by my GP, which has helped with my anxiety. I take them daily for a few months now. Not looking to get off of it for now. Started in 2023, stopped for 6 months and restarted in May 2024 after a relapse.
* Prep / pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention: This I have been of for a long time and still do
* 40mg statin: Ongoing since Dec 2021.
* Migraine medication - injectable: once a month for 2 months starting in August 2024. No major effects positive or negative.

Additionally, I have tried the following unprescribed supplements:

* Vedicinals: tried this for 3-4 months starting in 2022. Initially, I felt a bit of an improvement in chest pain and breathing but didn't last long, symptoms came back while still on it, so decided to stop. Tried again in 2023. Fewer improvements this time.
* Vitamin D: use it mostly during winter and overcast days. currently don't take it as is summer here.
* Vitamin C: used for a month in April 2024, then replaced by citric fruits, mandarin or kiwis, first thing in the morning.
* Enhanced NAC: found this to be recommended by multiple people online. Tried 3 times a day for 3 months, then once a day for 3 more months, and then stopped. Started in April 2024. Unsure if this had any effects.
* Vitamin B complex: take one daily starting after I stopped the enhanced NAC.
* Naturopath remedies: tried this very early in 2023. Total waste of time and money. Unsure of what I got given but had zero positive effect on me.

Additional treatments I have done:

* Hypobaric pressurised oxygen therapy (HBOT): short-term benefits, allowed me to be more active, but didn't help long term. Did 10 sessions in a soft shelf capsule in 2022 and 10 sessions in a hard shelf capsule in 2023.
* Counselling: I had two different therapists. The first one caused more anxiety and frustration than help, second one was better and gave me better coping mechanisms and tools to manage frustration and anxiety. Still ongoing.
* Acupuncture: small and short-lived benefits. Did 8 sessions in 2024, two-three times a week
* Chiropractor: adjustments to the spine and chest. 7 sessions  in 2022 but no improvements
* Physiotherapy: strengthening and massage. This really helped with the pain. Started this after the steroids and antihistaminics, so keep that in mind. Sessions include strengthening exercises and massage. Still ongoing. feeling improvements, especially pain. Started in August 2024

Things that helped me:

* Walking: this one was the most surprising one. If pains appear or feeling like I'm about to have tachycardia, going for a light walk for 20 minutes helps. pace depends on my energy levels. I got a dog 2 years ago, so I go for walks 3 times a day usually 20 to 30 minutes each time but can go up to 90 minutes a time.
* Yoga: I picked up yoga before the pandemic and it was one thing that I was able to do without triggering pains or tachycardia. however, I did pace myself at the beginning, until I was more comfortable. Session of up to 20-30 minutes 4 -5 times a week.
* Weight training: I have done weight training throughout the whole duration of my illness. However, I have stopped and restarted many times. Some stops lasted months and when restarted I started very very low. Think 5 - 10 min with 1kg or 2kg. Currently, I don't lift more than 12 kilos at the time. But I can go for 30-40 minutes. Lifting too heavy causes pain and a general feeling of unwellness.
* Low-sugar diet: I have been vegetarian since 2017. However, I have reduced my processed sugar intake. I did find I have sugar cravings, mostly chocolate. While I haven't been able to cut it off entirely, I have reduced the amount significantly.
* Salt intake and pressure socks: I did this suspicious of having POTS. I found the socks helped, especially while exercising. After a couple of months, I stopped using the socks but kept the salt intake.
* Limiting alcohol use: I increase my consumption in early 2024, mostly to deal with the stress and frustration of life and illness. Now I limit my consumption to 1 or 2 drinks every fortnight. I replace it with lime and bitters or tonic and lime. I prefer wine or vodka tonic instead of beer.
* Limiting caffeine: I changed to decaf coffee for 2.5 years. I recently started reintroducing caffeine and I can take 1 cup of regular coffee a day. I might take an additional cup of decaf if I'm craving coffee.
* Physio: I found the physio exercises were a great way to re-introduce weight training into my life. Additionally, the massages during the sessions really helped with chest and back pain. The relief doesn't last long, but the more sessions I've done the better I feel.

Things that have negative effects:

* COVID infections: they have had different effects, suspecting that different variants had different effects. The first two infections didn't make the symptoms worse, but the third one caused a bad relapse.
* Lack of sleep: If I don't sleep a minimum of 6 hours I experience chest pains the following day. I tend to take naps during the day when feeling tired. Sleep also helps reset the pain.
* Stress: Stress caused by work or finances or similar causes chest pains.
* Extreme weather: too cold or too hot days seem to have small effects.
* Overexercise: This is improving, but overdoing it seems to trigger chest pain.
* Doing too much: Doing too much, think a busy day at work, taking care of the house and then going out after work. I pace myself with my social life, work, house responsibilities, taking care of my dog, dating, travelling, etc.

Where I am right now:

* Pain: pain has reduced significantly. I don't feel pain for most part of the day, and when I do is not too bad.
* Tachycardias: Episodes have stopped for now. Heart rate is normal even if chest pain is present. HR goes up to 150 bpm while exercising without major effects other than a little chest pain.
* Sleep: I'm able now to sleep better, I also changed my routine to go to bed by 9.30 pm and wake up at 5 am. I usually walk the dog at 5.30 am and I'm at the gym by 6.30 am. Take a nap during the day, usually during lunch or after work.
* Exercise: I'm now able to exercise daily. I work out at the gym between 30 to 40 minutes four times a week, do yoga twice a week and recently added 20min cardio at the end of the day, run outdoors or cycle at the gym, walk the dog 3 times a week and play volleyball at the beach for up to 3 hours once a week. The more I do the longer I can do it for. I can lift heavier and the pain seems to get better. Pain is not gone and if I get too tired then I do start feeling pain, and while still lingers, it doesn't stop me.
* Work: I work remotely full-time in a desk setting. I still try to go to the office once a week and looking to increase that to twice a week. The social aspect helps me improve my mood. I take regular breaks and try to manage the stress as much as possible
* Travelling: I have been able to travel domestically and overseas with the longest trip being from Australia to New Jersey without major issues. I have a little fear of flying and on my last flight, a rough landing combined with an infection caused a relapse.
* Social life: I had to rebuild my social circles and make new friends. I'm social and outgoing which makes it easy to make friends, I start new friendships by talking about limitations so people know what to expect from me about what I can and cannot do. Sex life is back to normal without issues.

Next steps:

* Relapses: relapses still happen. The first time I got sick I was very sick for 6 months, including 3 months unable to leave the house or go very far. Second relapse lasted 3 months, third relapse lasted 6 weeks. They usually happen around flu season or cold winters. I'm expecting a relapse a year which lasts for about 4-6 weeks.
* Doctors: I'm seeing a nerve pain specialist next, referred by the respiratory specialist. Have a follow-up with the respiratory specialist who is also researching COVID. I also have a follow-up with the rheumatologist and still doing physio and counselling.

For now, I'm trying to do the best I can while my health is under control. I will take things as they come and will deal with relapses and symptoms as they come, but for now, I feel like I have recovered up to 90 per cent, with most of the improvements happening in the last 6 months.

Please feel free to contact me directly with any questions, however, I would prefer comments so all the people can benefit from the information.",2,1735521122.0,vaccinelonghauler,0,1.0,False

I've been staying in the hotel where I work for a few days again. And it sucks because I'm never not available. Guests have started to notice this, and instead of going to the agent on duty (the younger of the two), they'll come to my room even though my door has a DND on the handle. And it's  not always for something small that I can just ruin into the apply closet for either.  Sometimes, it's for grievances with other guests. And I just have to be like, ""Sorry, I'm not on the clock. You'll have to go to [front desk agent on duty].""
But they say that they have and he isn't doing anything. 
There was one time after my shift when I was in the lobby getting a drink from our minibar and a couple was trying to get more coffee for their room and he wasn't doing anything but saying,  ""oh,  I can't make coffee Ave breakfast has ended.  (Which is billshit)""
They recognized me in my civilian clothes (I admit I have a very recognizable face and walk). The couple were just likeugh, could you just go get us the coffee? So I did. It's annoying by not too bad. 

The part that pisses me off the most is the tardiness. He is habitually 30 - 45 minutes late to every shift. 

His mom, the night audit does the same stuff and also turns the lights off in the treat shop (which is open 24/7. More and more often,  I'll get there in the morning to a line  of guests trying to check out or buy something. and she'll still be asleep. YES SHE FALLS ASLEEP DURING HER SHIFT! 

The part that I dislike the most is sometimes, our gm will be easygoing the cameras from her house on her phone Ave see that there is a long line of people, call me and say get down to the lobby an hour or two before my shift starts just to take care of whatever is going on that NA is ignoring. 
I wouldn't mung it if it weren't pushing my hours dangerously close to 32. In order to get government assistance, I can't work more than that a week. 

Yes, I understand that she needs to hire people to replace them before she starts firing,  but the amount of bullshit in willing to put up with is only so much!

We had a nice coffee date on the 18th December, seemed to get on well, and had planned a second date on the 21st but unfortunately he got the flu so we had to postpone. I paid for the first date as he was coming straight from work and had something on that evening, so I said I'd grab us coffee so we didn't waste time standing in a queue. He said the next one was on him. I personally don't like someone paying for me on the first date so didn't mind doing this - after all it's only coffee (I do not feel like he owes me anything!)

We had exchanged numbers and were messaging back and forth via WhatsApp as I had to head to my parents for the holidays on the 21st and won't be home for another week (though my parents house is only an hour away from mine)

Up until the 24th he was really talkative, lots of messages etc and then he said he was sorry he wasn't overly chatty whilst he was unwell (even though it was fairly nonstop), I said that was fine and that we didn't need to talk all the time (because we both have lives, aren't dating, and barley know each other)

The past 5 days it's like getting blood out of a stone. He's sending short responses or leaving me on read. 

He messaged me on Saturday asking if I wanted to meet up early this week otherwise things might ""fizzle out"". I suggested Monday as its the only day I'm free and I'm happy to meet him halfway (only about a 30-40min drive). He read my response, left it on read, and has been on Whatsapp multiple times today with no response. I also know he had no plans for today (but I did)

And since I don't know where else to post it, I thought this subreddit was the best place for it.  
  
I am a Lebanese Christian, but more importantly, a fellow neighbor who struggles to understand the animosity between our two countries and peoples. Why is it that we, who share so much in common—our food, culture, vibrant nightlife, and histories—are stuck in this cycle of hate and conflict? Why do we hate each other instead of holding Europe accountable for its historic discrimination against both of our peoples?



Sometimes, I imagine what it would be like to have a coffee in Tel Aviv and take a train from there to Beirut. Our people could truly get along! While I deeply despise Hezbollah and understand the threats it has posed to Israel, that doesn’t explain why Israel bombed us in the 1950s, broke the armistice treaty, or invaded us in 1982. And today, even after a ceasefire, your army continues to carry out actions that make it hard for us to see peace as a possibility. If the roles were reversed, I’m sure you wouldn’t feel friendly toward a country that treated you the way Israel treats us. And that's not even mentioning the atrocities committed in Palestine and the ongoing suffering of the Palestinian people (relevant here because it's an example of how you treat your neighbours when they're weaker).



Israel is so much stronger economically and militarily than Lebanon, which is why I believe it’s your duty to show a proof of good faith. Such actions could strengthen the arguments of those who, like me, reject the notion that “resistance” against Israel is the only option.



There was once a thriving Jewish community in Lebanon. It’s heartbreaking that today, the Israeli government continues to provoke and harm us—sometimes even threatening our eradication—while claiming to act on behalf of the Jewish people. Sadly, such claims fuel the very anti-Semitism I’m sure you’ve encountered.



In Lebanon, we often debate this issue. Many of us advocate for dialogue with Israel, but we’re quickly shut down by reminders of countless Israeli violations of our sovereignty. I’m genuinely curious—does this topic ever get discussed in Israel? Do you personally feel that Lebanon shouldn’t exist, or do you believe, as I do, that one day we can live together in peace?



I’m not here to attack or provoke anyone. I’m here to learn, to hear your perspectives, and to find hope that one day our peoples can move past this tragic history and build a brighter future together.



Shalom, and thank you for taking the time to read this.

I find it very hurtful and don't know how to react. I'll get into the details of the letter, but here's some context first:

* We broke up about 9 months ago. Things weren't working for a while and we were both unhappy, but I was the one who finally pulled the plug and ended it. At the time, I saw it as no one's fault, we just didn't work out. My ex and I are in the same service organization and have mutual friends, but I asked that we go no contact for a month or two just so I could have some distance.
* After two months, my ex really wanted to have a big clear the air conversation to help process the breakup. She said we could process it over time, but I didn't want to drag it out so I said we can air everything out in one go and then whatever comes up after we deal with on our own. It ended up being a long and painful conversation, mostly consisting of her apologizing for her behavior and letting work and depression get in the way of our relationship. I admitted whatever mistakes I felt I made, and it seemed like we could move forward at least as cordial friends. My ex said she wanted to try being actual friends. Since we were friends before dating, I agreed to try as long as we took baby steps. I reiterated to her at this point that I had no intention of getting back together and it seemed like she understood.
* After one or two 1:1 hangouts and phone calls, I felt there was a lot of emotions left on both sides and it was too hard. So I went to her in person and said I want to move on and it's too painful to be friends. I told her I'd say hi in group settings, but I can't do 1:1 contact and we should deal with our emotions on our own. She then revealed she had been hoping we'd get back together the whole time. It didn't hit me at the time, but I was hurt by this because it felt like she wasn't being true with her intentions.
* A few months later we are at the same party. I feel anxious but tried some exposure therapy and engage in small talk with her for about 10-20 minutes. It seemed fine until later when she came to say goodbye and asked if I wanted to get coffee sometime. I said no, it's too hard, but she kept asking why and was very persistent. I kept saying no, even going so far as to say ""I heard you have a new boyfriend, I don't think us hanging out is appropriate."" Eventually she left but said I can always call her if I want to talk. I was really angry the days after this, but left it alone. I blocked her number to prevent myself from reaching out, because how can I say I don't want 1:1 contact when I am the one reaching out?
* Again like 2 months later she texts me in a group messaging app saying she's hurt that I find it hard and painful to be around her and that she misses me. She says she's not going to force a friendship but she is hopeful we will be friends in the future. I didn't know how to respond so I didn't.
* 3 weeks after that, we again happen to be at a party together. This time, I didn't go up to start a conversation, we pretty much ignored each other the whole time. We only acknowledged each other at the very end when people were leaving, exchanged brief pleasantries and then went our separate ways.
* The following weekend is when I get this letter on my doorstep, tucked in an old book I had lent her when we were dating. The letter basically said: here's my last attachments of you, with this I am letting go. I don't know if you care about me anymore, but it's clear you don't want me in your life right now. You got everything you wanted since the breakup, to get rid of me, disregard my existence, but I sense a deep sadness within you. I have had a great year and really found myself, I hope you find yourself too. Respectfully, I am never reaching out again.""
* If this is truly the end, I am glad, but I found the letter very hurtful. Am I overreacting? She isn't in my life, so it feels very disrespectful to call me sad and depressed. And I haven't tried to disregard her existence, but I feel she keeps crossing boundaries and begging for a friendship. Have I not been clear enough with her? Did I need to specifically say ""we will never be friends, stop reaching out?"" I'm trying to figure out if I'm being immature or hurtful, so please enlighten me.",3,1735520859.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Hey Reddit, first post, need some help. I, 23F, have an older sister, 26F, named Ellen (fake name). Context: We've never been really close as siblings. Our parents divorced when I was 4 and she was 7. Our parents now get along well enough, but when they first separated they were both doing bad. Both in a depression, our dad drinking a lot (he's an alcoholic) and our mom struggling to keep it together mentally and financially. I don't have a lot of memories from around this time.

Recently me and my sister met up over coffee to have a 1-1 talk for the first time in a long time after barely haven spoken for 2 years (1st year because I was living abroad). Ever since moving back to my home ""region"" (same country, different city ca. 45 min away) in February I haven't heard much from Ellen, which at first wasn't that unusual. By Springtime I had a feeling something was off. I went on a vacation with my dad and later with my mom and asked them about it separately. Both of them confirmed my suspicions that Ellen was avoiding me. They both explained to me that Ellen had recently come out and accused them of having treated us (and her specifically) unfairly during our youth right up to our college years. According to Ellen they had often given me more/easier privileges. Think typical Older-Younger sibling stuff, but she expressed that our case was even more exaggerated. Neither of my parents think this to be true and they have called and talked about it to reflect, but they remain convinced that it is not the case. This weighed on me for the rest of the year. Especially for our younger years I don't have a lot of memories (trauma tends to repress) and so I don't feel like I'm in a position where I can say wether it true or not. Ellen didn't talk to me about it, until a few days ago when I reached out to her and asked to meet up for coffee.

After some regular chit-chat I asked (shortened): ""I heard you feel like we were treated differently growing up, you wanne talk about it?"" She said ""Yeah, I don't feel that way, it's just the truth."" She started by recounting how hard the divorce was on her. She became responsible for me when our parents weren't able to. For example, when our dad would start drinking too much or our mom would sob, my sister would pull me away and watch TV with me in our room. I started developing serious anger issues to deal with the stress. Apparently at age 4 I got mad, stole her pocket money, ripped it and burned it. (I found it a little bit hard to believe that a 4 year old could do that, but I do know that I was able to get that angry, so I didn't question it.) When things like this happened, according to my sister, my parents would run to me to try and calm me down and would tell her to pay it no attention and to try and let it go. She told me nobody ever made sure she was ok or to reassure her that I wouldn't hurt her (anymore). Again, there's no way for me to know if this is true or not. If so, that truly sucks. She told me other things, like when our dad would complain to her how much our mom sucked (she was 9) and how my mom told her she's the only one she can talk to and how she was her best friend (she was 13). Ellen then started telling me that she's been in a therapy program for 6 months already and that it should help her uncover her most deeply rooted problems and that this part of her youth was the biggest issue. The part that left her ""no room for fun or being a kid"". That does indeed suck. When we got older it was other typical stuff like she had to fight to be able to go out with friends while I didn't and got to do it when I was younger, that kinda thing.

She says she's been distancing herself from me because I am a trigger to her. She says she doesn't blame me for these things, but she fears that being near me for too long might cause her to snap and get angry at me. She said that, when I previously would talk to her about my hardships, she doesn't find the capacity to take on my troubles. This was fairly early in the convention so I made a note of not bringing up things that happened to me or are currently happening to me. Thing is, I'm currently going through the hardest time of my life. I've been looking for a job since February and haven't found anything, it's given me enormous stress and panic. It's slowly been grading me down until I felt like my life had no purpose and I started thinking about suicide a concerning amount of times. My therapist and doctor recently prescribed me an antidepressant, the first one I've ever taken in my life. I've been on and off in therapy since I was a child, first to manage my anger issues, then to address my poor relationship with my dad (ca16 yo), then to work through the aftermath of losing my virginity to a rape (18 yo), couples therapy and now my current therapist. It's never come to the point where I wanted to take my own life and it is terrifying.

But I didn't tell her about my state of being. I told her that I noticed the distance set between us and she said she didn't mean to pull me into all of this. I told her that that is impossible, when your plan is to distance yourself for (at least) a year from your only sibling. Of course I would notice, find out and be worried. I've been wrecking my head over what could've happened and if I had done something wrong. She said that that's fair. It made me realise she didn't even consider what I would feel or think during this time. In fact, a lot of the things she said, from later in our youth when I started growing a conscious, are things I similarly experienced and she thinks are exclusive to her. We have the same parents and the same household after all. I also had to deal with our dad's drinking or our mom's fat phobia or school grade expectations. Ellen believes she shielded me for a lot of it, but there's no way for me to tell how much. All I know is that I had to deal with it too and that it effected me too. I kept quiet and sympathetic, because I know it was a hard youth. I asked if there's anything that I had done in the later years (age 16+) that I could recall and maybe apologise for to give her some closure. She said no, apart from 1 thing that happend this year.
Around September we were having a conversation for the first time that year over text and I was talking about my struggles looking for work. I talked about how difficult it was to not lose hope and my industry was doing so bad that nobody was hiring. She asked me if I had applied to work in a grocery store as a temporary solution and I said no. I told her that I know myself (I used to work at H&M as a student) and that that would only make me more depressed and feel like I had given up. I would be afraid I wouldn't get out of that job and that for now I was doing well enough financially (I have saved up a lot and my partner has a full time job) so that I don't feel like I need to resort to that yet. She texted back saying it's not fair for me to complain to her about the work search because when she was looking for work she did apply to work as a cashier and got rejected. She did have more money issues and therefore she felt like I was acting like a bit of a brat. I ended the conversation there and it's been a load on my shoulders since, right up to this coffee date.

Ellen asked me to never compare our ""looking for work (LFW)"" experiences again. She said her situation (she got a good job after looking for 9 months) was way worse. During her LFW she lived in my dad's old house for a very low rent and he would sometimes get so drunk he would scream at her and she was scared he would come at night to physically kick her out. The reason for his anger was that she took awful care of the house (trash and clothes everywhere, not doing any chores, ridiculous energy costs, even not flushing the toilet) and it hurt my dad a lot to see it (not to excuse him, just context). She had very little money because she had to take care of herself, her BF and the cat Boo (important for later). I didn't know about this and felt/still feel awful for her. Knowing my dad he did this and would not remember afterwards, thus he would deny it.

However, this is where I did push back. I said we didn't need to argue, but I wanted to get some thoughts about that off of my chest. I told her that 1.) the fact she felt terrified of our dad was horrible 2.) doing financially bad because your BF contributes nothing to your household is kinda your choice. Of course it's more complicated then that, but financal status is a factor to be considered when picking a partner. For the 6(?) years they've been together he hasn't properly contributed anything financially to your situation. In fact both my parents have sunken thousands of euros into him, paying for his studies, transport, insurance, ect. Food for thought. 3.) That Boo was a family cat that you claimed for your own when dad left the old house and couldn't take her with him. I loved her dearly and almost spend my entire life with her (yea, it's an old cat) but because I was out of the country at the time you couldn't bother telling me, let alone asking me what to do with her? And now you complain to me that you couldn't take care of her? Despite this, if at any point you would've reached out to ask for financial help for Boo I would've asked ""how much?"" and so would our dad.
 
That's where my conversation with her ended. 30 minutes later I was talking to my dad about this, and together with him I started to realise some holes in her arguments and I felt a bit riled up. For example, she said she had to pay half her dorm rent when I didn't have to. My dad pulled up the receipts, it's not true. We both got the same base budget for a dorm, she just went over it because she wanted a dorm that would fit both her and her BF and she had to pay the extra. I got less money problems? We both got a 10k inheritance from our grandmother who died 10 years ago, that is what I am living off of rn. My sister? She burned through it slowly over the years because she had to pay for both herself and her BF. In fact, a lot of her financial complaints seemed to leed back to her having to pay for her BF.

I'd also like to clarify that my parents also did awful things to me that had dire consequences, since I apperantly have to defend that. Ever since my SA, I've had nightmares where my dad raped me, if that gives you an idea of my relationship with him. I actually get along with him fine enough in short bursts, but I also hate him and fear him more than anyone in the world. When I was 9 I physically fought my mom because she called me fat. She's also thrown glass at my face and bullied me. She also insisted for years that I was trans (I'm not, but shout out trans people <3) I also have vivid memories of feeling betrayed while my sister bullied me on the playground with her friends in primary school.

In summary, Saying you can't afford someone any sympathy because you believe your experience was worse is lacking basic human empathy. Saying you can't compare our situations by comparing our situations and declaring yours to be worse is contradictory. Saying I can't tell you how I'm doing because you don't want to be burdened with my problems but then lamenting to me about your well-being for hours is hypocritical.

The next day I texted her saying that the coffee date was a mistake and that I'd rather go no contact than low contact. I blocked her number and Facebook. This is bothering me constantly and I can't get it out of my head, so now I feel like the one who needs space. Did I overreact? Am I an asshole for not feeling worse for her? I do feel bad for some parts, but overall I feel like she's throwing a pity party.",8,1735520710.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

Eating food is really too difficult.,"I started on 30mg in September and then was upped to 50mg of lisdex (Elvanse is the brand name in the UK) because it wasn't effective enough. 

I used to work out a lot when I was unmedicated and it really started to be a form of self medication. I'd force myself to go (in a healthy way, it taught me to be more productive) when I felt stagnant, and I always at least felt like I'd accomplished something during the day. I also really liked the physical results and there are just many benefits to working out, of course.

As well as this, I enjoyed cooking and prepping meals as it gave me something to do. Plus, I needed to eat a lot with all the exercise 3-4 timws a week. I've always had a fast metabolism and ate like a pig usually. 

But boom, then I started meds and didn't need the exercise to feel productive as I would get everything I needed to DONE on the day. Work was a breeze, besides the occasional crashing. I'd have a smoothie and breakfast in the morning and then another smoothie in the afternoon and eventually cook a small dinner when I finally gained my appetite back. A typical day of eating for somebody on amfetamines, I have learned.

However, fast forward 4 months and now we're about to hit January. I have lost 14lbs and steadily going down. I really did not need to lose any weight as I am normally 9 stone (58kg). I am 5'2"" and a small female for reference. I've lost all my muscle as I no longer have energy for the gym because I just can't eat enough. The medication has been rinsing my system. I can't eat enough nutrient dense food because everything makes me gag in the first 3-4 hours.

I'm ready to go, sure, but I'm not strong. I drink plenty of water, yes. The last time I tried to train I was shaky and immensely light headed. I can't do exercise on no food.

Therefore, I am considering coming off of it completely. I'm so torn. I want my ""gains"" back, and a healthy gut. But on the meds I just have to eat what I fancy and it is really not good for me. And it's just never enough. I went from eating a lot in a day, to barely anything and just water/coffee.

I've been off it all this Christmas week so I could enjoy food. It's been nice, and I'm less cranky and don't have the Vyvanse/Elvanse ""rage"" of course. I'm not a zombified robot who's only goals are checking off tasks. But the downside of course is how distracted I've been. It's driven me nuts. I've been back to forgetting what the fuck was happening in a conversation 2 seconds prior.

Do I stop completely? And manage? And if I stop, does that mean they won't let me back on them again in future even if I wanted to?

Or, do I just take the meds on the days I really need them and have ""rest days"". So, only taking them at work (I work weekends and a few weeknights at a bar) or when I'm driving. ",6,1735520677.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

without getting into all the details, the lady seemed very frustrated and as i was trying to back off from the situation and leave it be, my mother (who wasn’t really picking up on the scenario) ended up screeching one of the chairs against the floor and it caused the lady to throw her hands over her head and tell us to just take the whole table and that she was just going to leave. while this was happening i made sure to back up and attempt to diffuse the situation by getting my mother to stop making noise and trying to explain herself because it was clearly making things worse. 
the woman went to the other side of the cafe and was telling the barista something when my mother made us just leave without the table or the chairs.
while i would have handled the initial situation much differently than my mother did, i feel like my attempts at diffusing the situation did absolutely nothing to help. what can i do better? if i or someone i’m with accidentally cause a meltdown of some sort how should i

A problem (i don't know if its a real problem) every time i go to bloom my coffee bed, is that a crater/sink whole seems to form and based on watching videos this shouldn't be happening. Wondering if anyone knows if i'm doing something wrong here!!

1hpaqml,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1hpaqml/mod_the_official_deal_thread/,[MOD] The Official Deal Thread,"Welcome to the /r/Coffee deal and promotional thread! In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

This also serves as a megathread for coffee deals on the internet. If you see a good deal, post it here! However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Daily Question Thread would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask! And please, ask for permission first rather than forgiveness later.",5,1735519763.0,Coffee,2,1.0,False
1hpaqbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hpaqbx/why_do_i_attract_men_on_opposite_sides_of_the/,Why do I attract men on opposite sides of the spectrum online?,"I often match with men that want to take me super seriously before meeting me and act almost clingy as well as men who are super low effort, and not looking for anything serious. I don’t know what to do with either other than I know I’m not interested in them. 

Any ideas of what might be causing this behaviour on my end? I try not to engage more than is needed to get a sense of a person, but sometimes the texting does go on longer than needed and makes way for the clingy type. They tell their friends about me before meeting me and I find it strange. The ones I barely text with other than to set up a date and build some surface level rapport are so low effort. Car and coffee dates are their form of dating but they’re rarely intentional.

I am looking for new hobbies/interests that will help me make new social connections. Until recently, most of my outside of work activities revolved around kids' extra-curriculars. I have some free time now, and I don't know how to fill it.

What do you do for fun? I've read other posts which suggest taking a class or registering for something from the leisure guide. Are you currently participating in any activities that you would recommend for making social connections?

I have considered:
- cooking classes
- dance classes
- book clubs

I work from home primarily, which doesn't help with social connections. 
I have joined Meetup and have been to one event so far.

From other posts on Reddit, it seems that many others are also trying to make friends in Winnipeg. I would love to make a connection to go for coffee, a walk at the Forks, see a movie, go to the Leaf, etc.",7,1735519555.0,Winnipeg,0,0.89,False
