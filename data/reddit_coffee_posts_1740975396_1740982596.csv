For a second, everything felt familiar - the way you sipped your coffee, the way you glanced at your phone, the way your presence filled the space. I wanted to say something, to ask how you’ve been, to share the little things that have happened since we last spoke. But instead, I just walked in, grabbed my favorite coffee, and left pretending I didn’t see you, pretending I didn’t care.

The truth is, I did. I do.

I miss you. Not just the way things were, but the way I could talk to you about anything and everything. I miss the way we used to laugh over the smallest things, how we made plans for places we never got to visit, how we found comfort in just sitting together in silence.

But I know we’re better this way. We made our choices, and maybe this distance is what’s best for both of us. Even if it stings a little, even if part of me still wants to tell you everything, I’ll respect the space we now have between us.

I hope you’re doing well. I hope you’re happy. And maybe, just maybe, I hope you miss me too.

I am 26 year old Australian guy thinking of doing a Group Tour across Spain and potentiallly Portugal during either May,June or July. I have only travelled Asia before, but never really been to Europe, and since its first time in Europe, I was thinking of doing a group tour.  I just wanted to get people thoughts on travelling to Spain on a group tour as opposed to travelling solo.

If I was to give a brief summary of my personality, I would say I am half extroverted and half introverted. I am quite social and do like to meet new people and make new friends, go to bars, potentially go to a nightclub (i do enjoy spainish music). But I also do have have a quiet side, and would prefer to stay in my own room rather than in shared accomodation, and I wouldn't want to make the focus of my trip around going partying and getting drunk everynight. Ideally, my main hobbies on a trip include:  
\-Finding good food and coffee  
\-Occasionally finding a good bar/nightlife (not something I would want to do every night thought)  
\-Meeting new people.  
\-Exploring the cities and exploring nature - I would love to find a good swimming spot or something.

The benefits I could see from doing a group tour could include:  
\-having a set plan and itineary   
\-being around a guide that is familiar with the culture, language, go to spots in a city. (I unfortunately cannot speak Spainish)  
\-being more safe in a foreign country  
\-Having more people to socialise with and make friends.

I have done a few groups in Asia, some have been great but others I haven't really enjoyed. The two main disadvantages I could think of include:  
\-Sometimes feeling rushed and not having a just chance to explore a city at your own pace.  
\-Occasionally, being in a group that you do not reallly gel with (I've never really had this happen). But given my age, I know some group tours like G adventures and topdeck have older crowds (30-40) and contikis have younger crowds (18-22), so I am not sure if I would be on a trip with people my age. 

I know especially the two factors that I mentioned above are common for group tours that try and squeeze mutliple countries in europe in a short time span. My preference is to properly explore one or two countries, rather than only getting a short time in 10 different countries. Usually, when I travel my preference is to go with friends. But unfortunately, none of my friends are able to go with me at the moment, so the options would be a group tour or solo travel.

For those who have done a group tour around Spain or Portugal such as a contiki/top deck or any other tour, I would love to hear your experiences, recommendations, do/do nots etc...   
  
Thanks in advance :)

1j2c4rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1j2c4rz/what_the_hell_italy/,"What the hell, Italy?","I recently learned that between 70% and 90% of Italian households own a Moka Pot. Yet I, as an American, went my entire life without knowing about this perfect method of brewing coffee. I knew about cowboy coffee, drip machines, pour over, french press, espresso, cold brew, and even the aeropress.


But no Italians ever shouted from the rooftops the revelation of the Moka Pot. They didn't break into my house and shake me awake in the middle of the night to let me know about the Gospel of the Moka, as they should have. No, they have all been as quiet as mice. And come to think of it, they have been suspiciously quiet, and I have begun to consider the possibility that they have been attempting to hide the revelation of the Moka Pot from the rest of the world.


I will admit that I do not know any Italians, nor do I know of any Italians in my neighborhood or my city. But that is not an excuse for their silence. They should have sent missionaries to preach the gospel of the Moka to the rest of the world! The Moka Pot should be among the first things children learn about in life, along with God, Shakespeare, Bach, and Mathematics.


It's something so fundamental, so essential, that I can't even imagine the world I lived in prior to three days ago, when I brewed my first cup of coffee using a Moka Pot. I don't remember any of it. It's all black. I don't even remember who I was. When I try to, I go into some kind of dissociative fugue state, only to wake up several hours later gently caressing my Moka Pot, having no idea how or where I spent those hours.


Anyway, I digress. Actually I need to get ready for bed. I've been awake since 5am and I've had 12 cups of coffee today. The point is, less than 5% of American households have a Moka Pot and that needs to change.",1,1740982036.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 - The Reluctant Wisdom Seeker

“Welcome, noble wisdom seeker. As you begin the first module of the Ascension, know that you are chosen to honor the All-Father and to strengthen the pillars of Asgård. Your dedication and loyalty illuminate the way forward for all who serve. In the light of Mimir's Well, the strength of Yggdrasil, and the power of the Runes, you will be tested. Embrace these trials, for they are the forge through which your true potential is revealed. 
By the will of Odin, let your journey begin.”

The reluctant wisdom seeker felt the need to continue but something drew his attention elsewhere. Huginn accepted his gaze and tactfully pointed its beak in the direction of his terminal. Helpfully, it brought the anomaly stream into view and closed the training module. From somewhere over his right shoulder he heard the faint suggestion of Munin, “Try shutting your eyes to bring your mind back into balance.” It was a rehearsed motion as he brought his eyelids together and let the darkness envelop him for just the moment and only the moment. He didn’t know why but he always opened them again before the image of Odin was able to emerge. It was a kind of tic, without explanation, but scratching an unseen and unfelt itch whenever a resync was needed. With his attention back on the terminal he was able to feel the memory of Astrid. Munin dressed itself in the ascension gown at the edge of view. She had ascended three months ago and the bird made sure he felt prideful as her older brother, sometimes not as subtly as he would have liked. The high blue collar was befittingly formal for the ceremony, he thought, but put it out of his mind as he redirected his eyes toward Huginn. The crow plucked a ticket from the growing stream and opened the detailed view.

Through the eyes of a fellow Väljare, he was able to identify a minor distortion. It seemed to be caused by the positive air pressure while she moved from a travel module onto the platform. With two fingers raised, our wisdom seeker dictated to Munin, “Please step in front of the shop window to your right. This is a good place to reflect for a moment.” He immediately heard the same words repeated through the Väljaren’s Munin and soon after she closed her eyes. As the all-father filled her view the connection was terminated and the detail view closed. The ticket caught alight and reduced to a tiny blue flame which Munin happily swallowed as usual. Working at Odin Corporation was a blessing which only touched an elite few who showed certain potential. Everyone had a place in Yggdrasil but few ever climbed its branches. Leif’s grey pupils dilated only slightly and Huginn hopped nearer to the stream of tickets on the leftmost screen. The air hummed with the low notes of distant machinery as the crow manifested another detailed ticket view. This anomaly arose from Väljaren fatigue. Tiredness was common but usually went unnoticed. “Drift Alert! Please proceed to your nearest light chamber,” he spoke to Munin without lifting his gaze from the terminal screen. When he lowered two fingers into a raised fist the words transcribed themselves to an aura in front of the Väljare. He needed to interface a little longer or risk disconnecting from his implant. The Väljare managed to find an open pod rather quickly and without further intervention. The ticket immolated as before but left behind a wisp of green. Munin indulged. 

Bringing a degree of focus to the right screen, Leif  began staring through it. The shape of the data pulsed in his blurred vision like rain on the surface of a pond. Huginn clacked its beak, bringing Leif back into the still room. The calming hum was both warm and comforting like the terminal which cradled his body but also teetering on the edge of stifling, dulling the senses in a way that felt like wading through a thick fog. The bird clacked again and Leif was at full attention watching the numbers and symbols drift from all directions, a chaotic flow of data. Four objects caught themselves in the slipstream of a rune that Leif recognized and in an instant Munin pulled the thread-like collection of symbols from the screen, letting it hang limply from its beak for a moment. The thread floated out of its mouth as a strand of spider’s silk slips on the wind. It was absorbed into the left terminal screen and a new ticket emerged at the position. 

Huginn spoke directly to Leif, “It’s time to partake in the water of Mimir’s well.” An aura like the one he had just used to correct a drift anomaly began to creep in at the edges of his vision. Slipping out of the terminal was irritating, not because the use of his muscles after hours of motionlessness was a chore, but because the sensation of weight on his joints was a reminder that the ravens couldn't do everything for him. They both flew ahead of Leif as he exited his cubicle on the long row leading to the common area. There was a warm light which spilled over the high walls through the hanging atrium. About half the sprawling warehouse was cubicles, each housing a single two-screen terminal, a few hundred in total. The other half was an indoor garden spotted with sapling birch trees at the threshold, giving way to a grassy clearing in the shade of an enormous ash tree. Surrounding the tree were several round tables to accommodate each cohort of Väljare and on the far side was a single pane of glass overlooking the city below. From the outside, Odin Corp. appeared as a monolithic terrarium housing and protecting the world tree, Yggdrasil. Leif sat on the far side of the tree so that he faced the great ash tree, back to the sun warming his shoulders. He took a flask of a deeply blue liquid from the center of the table. 

“Hey Leif”, started Erik whose corporate kyrtill flashed brilliant blue as he approached the sitting area, sun beams passing through crooked branches. “These are new,” he continued as he brushed his fingers over the wandering grooves of the wooden table. “We can share our ravens here. Have a seat.” Erik sat down and Leif placed his free hand onto a small metal rectangle inlaid within the wood, Erik did the same. In vivid black, a raven appeared on Erik’s left shoulder, its head turned, an eye curiously searching the surface in front of it. “Wow. That is new,” Erik observed as he took a bottle from the center of the table for himself, his Huginn jumping onto the raw wood. The two ravens approached each other across the table with an excited hesitation. Leif’s looked around with a puzzled head movement as Erik’s bird vanished momentarily. Two more Galdrar sat down to accompany Erik and Leif, their presence reactivating the coherence table’s connection followed by two more ravens perching at their sides. “They sent out a jovin bulletin on them this morning. Coherence table. It uses neural multiplexing to broadcast a translated projection to the other people touching the input pads,” said Grant, reading the intrigued looks of everyone’s Huginn. “Must have been flagged as non-essential,” shrugged Erik. “I spent the morning deep in runes. It's hard to allocate for much else.”
Leif’s Huginn nodded in understanding. 

Grant prided himself on maintaining broader awareness streams, processing at a level that didn't exactly make Leif or Erik envious but they feigned impressed at the freshman behavior. “I got a rune earlier,” Leif added coyly. The eyes of ravens widened clockwise around the table. “It was luck I guess. I've been underclocking while working on the ascension module again.” The other ravens narrowed their tail feathers and stood taller showing a kind of solidarity. Leif’s Huginn was secretly blushing under its ebony plumage. Ascension was a special rank, a status beyond Galdr, reserved for those closest to Odin. The rites were a test of consciousness. There were 9 trials, representing the nine days Odin hung from Yddrasil. The first trial was difficult enough that very few continued. It was a meditation on pure neural processing where each galdaren was  tasked with rapidly hopping streams in an effort to complete an unknown data set. Too long on any stream and you would receive bad data, leading to an incomplete or unstable set of data at the end. Anomaly detection and remediation was one thing but real-time error correction was hard, not unlike finding patterns in the raw data feed. Leif was glad that his friends respected the effort behind the ascension trials. “It was ᚢ (Uruz),” he continued. “I've seen them before, usually with just three to five integers behind it. I was called to the Well before pulling the ticket but I'll have a look when I get back.” 

The mention of ascension, despite Leif’s quick retort, left a vacuum in the conversation. The galdrar drank their deep blue tonic. The warmed liquid tingled the tongue. It was as viscous as milk and clung to the sides of the flask just the same. While it was slightly bitter to most, the subtle acidity made it pleasant like a hot cup of coffee. “I have a rotation with a silver guild later this week. I was thinking it would be a good retreat before Galdrmót,” Grant said as he swung his flask past Huginn by the nape of the glass. The bottle obscured the raven from view just long enough for it to don a leather apron suddenly. Leif cut in, “I’ve always wondered how you manage Väljare rotations with everything else?”. Grant swapped his left hand for his right on the metal pad and a meeker raven took over. It carried a small metalworking mallet in its beak. “I grew up with the guild and silversmithing is a challenge on its own but different in ways that count. The memory allocation weaves several domains at once which is exactly the kind of training needed for the game,” Grant’s Munin roosted on the handle of the mallet now resting on the table. The annual competition was held every summer, across Asgårdian regions. The live broadcast attracted the attention of most everyone. There was an open call…",1,1740981888.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

&#x200B;

**I miss my husband so goddamn much.**

&#x200B;

I (35M) divorced my husband (36M) three years ago. And God, I miss him. I asked for a divorce for a few reasons, most of which being that his depression got exponentially worse day after day and he refused to seek treatment. Sometimes he wouldn't even go into work and ended up getting fired from his job. I stayed with him for so fucking long, praying that one day he would start trying to get better. It was all I ever wanted, but that day didn't come. I sobbed the entire time signing those papers, and when I handed them to him and asked for a divorce, he just gave me the emptiest, deadest look and signed them without a word. My heart felt like it had been shattered with a hammer, anger and sadness and fear tied together in the world's tightest, ugliest knot and inset deep into my chest.

I put on a brave face for my friends, tried to frame it as shackles coming off and a new beginning, but it was a lie. It just hurt, and it keeps hurting, and it will never stop hurting. He was my soulmate. I'll never love anyone like I loved him. He used to be so sweet and loving, so passionate and happy and every other wonderful thing a man could want from another.

They say each day gets easier, but it isn't for me. It's been three years and I'm still reaching over to the other side of the bed in the morning to pull him close, and it always stings when my hands touch fabric and not his skin. It's been three years and I'm still expecting to see his car in the driveway when I get home from work. It's been three years and my heart isn't any less broken than the day he left.

I've been stalking his socials, I'll admit. He's been getting back to the gym, started meds, and I see him smiling so genuinely in these photos. He looks so incredible. Maybe if I had just waited, he would have changed his mind and went to a doctor like he is now? Or was it me that held him down? Was I making it worse?

I hope not. I wanna go over to his place and just fall into his arms and beg him to take me back. Maybe he's wishing the same thing about me. If there's even a chance I could have my boy back I feel like I should try. I'll never know otherwise.

EDIT: One: I am a homosexual man. My husband is a homosexual man. I am not a woman. Yes, I know I'm effeminate and kind of emotional. Get creative.

Two: my husband was a binge drinker. He refused treatment no matter how much I begged. We got antidepressants but he wouldn't take them. I know he's started meds now because he's posted about them and his 2 yrs sober chip that he got last month.

Three: I never stopped loving him. I never loved him any less. Near the end of our marriage, I started drinking to cope. The second I realized I was, I realized he was dragging me down with him, and I couldn't help him anymore. I didn't dip the second it got hard. Many of you are being kind of rude. I'll accept that I wasn't the perfect husband, nobody is. But claims that I never loved him are just wrong and make me feel sick to my stomach.

EDIT 2: No, I am not the catalyst for this. His depression started when his young brother died terribly and unexpectedly. It's not because he just hated me so much. We were childhood sweethearts and had been together for years when this happened.

**Significant-Noise212**

*Sometimes, people just cannot progress until they hit rock bottom, and maybe you leaving was that for him. It doesn't necessarily mean you held him down, he just couldn't find the desire and motivation to progress while you were holding him. Don't beat yourself up. It wasn't your fault he was sick and didn't want to ask for help. In the end, we all need to want that help, without it all other people' efforts are worthless. In the end, if you ended amicably, you can always hit him up and ask how he feels. Maybe he'll ignore you, maybe not, but you'll now you've tried. And stop stalking him. That is keeping you from healing.*

>OOP: Thank you, I needed to hear a lot of this. Maybe I'll call him just to see how he's doing. He doesn't hate me, I know that much. I'd like to see him regardless.

**Update - 3 days later**

&#x200B;

Well, with Reddit's advice, I did it. A few days ago, I called my (35M) ex-husband (36M) whom I divorced after 6 years when he refused to seek treatment for his depression.

I called him later in the evening. It was the first time we'd spoken since a bit of trouble he'd had while he was still drinking 2 1/2 years ago. He picked up on the second ring. Our conversation was a little stilted at first, as to be expected, but he said he was really glad to hear from me. We ended up meeting up for coffee yesterday as so many of you suggested. I'll admit: it was kind of hard to see him, but in a good way? He looked so much better than the last time I had seen him, but he looked exactly like the man I married. He had put off a ton of weight (he gained like 75ish pounds during his struggle with depression, and before some dick says so, I didn't leave him because of his weight gain), he looked way healthier and very put together. I'll just say it: he looked incredibly hot. What made it hard was that I couldn't kiss him hello like I used to. But God, the way his eyes lit up when he saw me, I barely needed to.

We got our coffee and sat, and he updated me a little on his life in the last 3 years.

What really turned his life around was in part the divorce but moreso a DUI (nobody was hurt, he was caught a few blocks from his apartment). He's since gone to rehab and AlAnon, gotten his license back, and had to use a breathalyzer whenever he started his car for a while. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol since and I told him I was so fucking proud of him. He's also started antidepressants, and made a point of telling me that they're not SSRIs, but when I asked what that meant he got embarrassed and told me nevermind (???). Bottom line is that they've been helping him, he's back to being a gym rat, and he's almost completely turned his life around. This was around the point I started tearing up. It just felt so good knowing he was okay. Better than okay, he was *good*.

I also apologized to him for not sticking by him. He cut me off and said I had nothing to apologize for. He was a wreck, and I was being dragged down with him. That also felt good to hear. I apologized for not contacting him much during the last 3 years. That apology, he accepted.

He was dating someone for a few months, too. He broke up with him once he tried to get him to drink on New Year's. He seemed dismissive of the guy. Guess it wasn't too serious.

We got up and went on a walk after a few hours, and I think we both realized it felt like a first date. I had to stop myself from trying to hold his hand at a few points, I'll admit. We ended up sitting on a bench in a nearby park, and I confessed.

I told him I missed him more than anything, how I never stopped loving him, and how if he wanted to, I'd love to try again from the beginning this time. We'd go to couples' therapy, keep our heads above the water, and take it slow. He was quiet for a minute before he told me something. He said he was doing better now, but there may be a time where he sunk low again. Depression isn't easily cured, and he was far from cured. He still had bad days, but he said there would be one difference: he promised he would never stop trying to improve. He was never going to give up like he did before, and refused to neglect me like he used to. If I was willing to accept that truth, he was willing to try again. I agreed, and he pulled me into an embrace and snuck a kiss to my temple. You know when it's the first warm day of spring after a cold, harsh winter, and the soft breeze and basking sun hit your skin at the same time? It felt something like that, to the 1000th degree. After a while he walked me back to my car and squeezed my hand goodbye, and the second I got inside I started sobbing like a baby. Happy tears, though.

I'm currently sitting in bed, kicking my feet like a teenage girl, texting him back and forth to schedule an actual date. He said he'd plan everything, and try his best to make up for the birthdays and anniversaries he missed. He said it would ""knock my socks off."" What a dork. I love being in love. Not gonna lie, this is gonna be a bit hard to explain to my friends and family. Not looking forward to those conversations, but right now I don't care. My man loves me.

Thank you to everyone who had kind words to say, and all the people that messaged me with sympathy and advice. I hope we all find happiness, and love if we want it. I never would have made the leap if y'all hadn't encouraged me. Best of luck to all of you, and sorry for the overly flowery language <3

*I knew a woman who divorced her husband for the same reasons. They’d had 3 kids, one whom was mentally ill. Married for 25 years. She was tired of covering up for him, dealing with his shit. He was losing clients, etc. So she kicked him to the curb. Three years later, he’d gotten sober, counseling. They remarried. She loved the person, not the drunk.*

After years of verbal and emotional abuse, I finally realized *I* was not the problem, as I was continually told during every argument while being criticized and gaslit. I am not 100% sure he is a narcissist… in fact, I actually think he could be ASD, but he won’t even admit that he is responsible for any of our problems. So irrelevant.

I began documenting our daily interactions and typing out the things he said to me verbatim so I wouldn’t have a chance to “talk myself out of it” or minimize the conversations in my mind. I’ve now done this for over a year, and read all of the vile, hateful things he’s said to me- often when our kids are right on the other side of the wall- pretty frequently to step back and remind myself what kind of person he is and the type of marriage this is.

Something finally clicked, and I can’t open myself up emotionally to him or trust him at all. It’s not even hatred; it’s just apathy and revulsion. I don’t care about his opinion on anything, I genuinely don’t care about what he thinks of me, I don’t want to be around him, and it’s incredibly refreshing but also terrifying because I think this is really the end. I’ve been emotionally distancing myself for months and he continually tells me how “mean” I’ve been to him (LOL) by maintaining boundaries, “Lower your voice. You will not speak to me that way.” keeping a respectful distance, only discussing the kids, and emotionally grey rocking. 

I’ve cut off almost all intimacy… but unfortunately I have needs… and I’ve been drinking heavily, which I know needs to stop. Suddenly, he’s being SO nice, caring, doting, thinking ahead and planning nice things for me. Being affectionate, caring, complimentary. Literally woke up early to go out and get me coffee TWICE this week and let me sleep in. Genuinely apologizing when he says something out of line. Thanking me for things I have done for our kids for years. Obviously I am responding positively to these things. 

Is this love bombing? I am so confused. I obviously don’t want to get divorced and only see my kids half the time, and I’m worried about finances. But
I don’t trust him at all. I keep saying, “I don’t understand why you’re being so nice.” And he says, “what do you mean?” or “you’re being nice to me!” like he does this all the time.

The worst part about all of this is knowing he’s capable of this kindness and thoughtfulness, but (for the most part) completely withholding it for the last couple of years.",1,1740981658.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

I only recently have been thinking about our relationship and idk if it’s very healthy. 

He is kind of strict about what I wear and where I can go. Which I don’t really mind too much. Because he’s also really nice like he always brings me my favorite coffee almost every time we see each other or we go together and he never gets annoyed and he is honestly really nice and he gets me presents all the time. Like not crazy huge stuff but it makes me feel really nice like he loves me. And he doesn’t pressure me with sex. But honestly I was supposed to go over to his house yesterday last night but I told him I couldn’t because my parents wanted to watch a movie together and he said no I have to come over. I wasn’t on my phone really because I was watching the movie and then I fell asleep and today I saw that he sent me a lot of texts last night like he was angry and said mean stuff to me. He thought I was ignoring him or something or lying. My mom told me that he even came over at like 2am to see me but she told him that I was sleeping so he just left. It’s not that weird since we live close by but still. It just made me feel a little weird. Like I’m sorry I fell asleep but it was an honest mistake. Also like one time he kind of “slapped” me but not really, it wasn’t hard and he kind of just pushed my face. It didn’t hurt or anything. And he said sorry. I kind of just tried to forget about it because I really love him so we never talked about it again. 

Maybe this is just like his personality? And he’s not abusive. I’m only wondering because my mom asked me if everything’s okay since he came by so late and he seemed upset. 

Like I said he’s really nice. He normally treats me like a queen. ",1,1740981560.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
1j2c04j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1j2c04j/aita_for_telling_my_25f_partner_27m_that_its_not/,AITA for telling my (25F) partner (27M) that it's not my fault he has no friends?,"My partner and I have been together for about 2 years now. He has no vices and focused only on his work. On his days off, he stays at home (in our apartment), doing house chores. He loves to cook so that's what he does when he has free time. I never have to worry about laundry too as he does the heavier chores. I do the dishes and folding, I cook sometimes too. I am the one maintaining and cleaning our tiny apartment, and we never had issues with this dynamic we have going on. During our first few months he made it clear and insisted I never had to worry about laundry and food anymore since he told me he should be doing all that. I work from home, basically working Monday through Friday alone in our house while he's working six days a week. As for the expenses, we share equally on bills and expenses. We never had issues with this as well. Weekends are my days off and I take these days to meet with my childhood friends (some who are also my cousins) and my sibling/sister. Some weekends I go home to my parents. This is because his field of work requires him to work on the weekends and on those days that he's at work, I am left alone feeling bored and sad. For context, I have always been an adventurous person. I love going on trips, swimming, eating out and visiting cafes with friends. I love talking and catching up. He on the other hand, have no legit friends. He says he has a few ""friends"" (but more like acquaintances) at work, those he can laugh with and talk with casually, but not on a deep level like the ones I have. When I ask him about friends during his high school and college years, he just tells me he had a few at some point. Now? None. Maybe he was just an introverted guy and I am his complete opposite, but I see him acting normally toward others like any person would. He can be loud and funny too. He jokes all the time and smiles, which I don't get because how on earth did you not have friends with that personality right? Sometime I think maybe it's because of his upbringing. He grew up with strict parents. At one point he shared that growing up his father didn't allow him to be outside and play too much. That he'd always get scolded if he played basketball and get all sweaty and dirty. He told me maybe that was the reason why he never really learned how to make friends and have fun during his younger years. I was the opposite though. I had the time of my life during my teenage years. I enjoyed every bit of it and gained my friends for life. My friends and I were together since kindergarten. We were classmates in primary and secondary schools. We were school mates in college. We have been through hell and back. I have them as a family even before my partner came into the picture. Up until now, we meet each other occasionally for a simple dinner or coffee. When we have the time, we still drive around and catch up like before.

The problem is, my partner seem to not like this. One time we argued that I went home late when I went out with my best friends who I consider family. He told me ""that is not how a female should act"". When we got together the first time, I made him aware that I'd still want to have a life outside of a romantic relationship. I told him that I am the adventurous, social type, but only with my closest friends. To be fair I never mingled with just anyone other than friends or family, and it has been like this ever since.

I told him that they are family too. I said that I need a life other than staying inside the apartment waiting for him to come home from work. I told him I need some fun in life too. It's not like I do this every week I said. Of course we're all adults and have our own responsibilities too. I tried to include him in our plans so he can meet them and experience some time with them, so he could know "" how it's like"". He met the whole circle once then never again. I also have two best friends from this circle who I regularly talk to. My partner knows them and is okay with them. But sometimes us three would go out and come home late, which I would always inform him. I always shared my location and updates him from time to time of our activities and whereabouts. My friends fetch and drop me off door to door, so I don't see what he's so worried about when he tells me ""It's too dangerous outside"" ""girls shouldn't be doing that"" ""why come home late and make me overthink"" telling me that I am making him worried. One time he joined us, he just slept in the car. Sometimes I get sad that I never get to talk to him about fun things. It's just about work, work, work.

At one point I told him to calm down and trust me for once. I get it that he's been cheated on before, that's why maybe he has some issues with me but I never gave him any reason to overthink about anything. I told him that it wasn't my fault he have no friends of his own.

I just want to meet my friends without him being salty about it and throwing tantrums like a kid everytime I'm with them. It's not like I'm always with my friends all the time. Once or twice a month is not a crime.

Now I'm thinking of all the future arguments we're gonna have if we don't talk about this. I also wanna know the things I can say or do to make this situation work for the both of us.

1j2byt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1j2byt3/billys_happening_now_in_hawaii/,Billy's Happening Now in Hawaii,"Today let’s talk about some cool things I did after coming to Hawaii on this business trip.

On my first day here, Friday, I visited Spill the Tea Cafe and had a chance to talk with a lot of people across the board: people in leadership, people who are therapists, and most importantly the teenagers visiting the cafe. It had just been a few months since I last visited but the same kids who were going through tougher times in the past were doing a lot better. The work that we do seems to be working, and that’s always a good thing to observe. Then I went to the beach with Kiki and Alec to catch some waves and talk about life at the beach.

Yesterday was a big day. I started out with my morning bows at the hotel and set out west for a cup of coffee and malasadas for an early morning breakfast. Then I visited my favorite restaurant in Oahu, Ono Seafood, for some poke and headed to the Honolulu public library. I wrote about The Peopling of Hawaii yesterday, that was the book I picked up; I hope to return to the library tomorrow to check out some more Hawaii-specific books only available at this library.

On my 6am coffee walk it was still dark. The lights from the houses on the hills reminded me a lot of Tansen, Nepal. Here is Tansen:

And here is Hawaii:

I’ve been walking this particular trail in Hawaii every time I visit, and this year I noticed something different: there were so many fish here I could see them moving around even in the dark. I had never seen that before. What gives? Then on my way to the library I saw why.



https://preview.redd.it/9mxvo1jczeme1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96b19173ae6479044ca54b458e06dfa2bd17f843

Genki balls! So these are mud balls assembled by hand with some chlorophyll and other enzymes designed to foster purification in the Ala Wai waters. Ala Wai is this manmade canal in Honolulu that I’ll get into in another writing and I cannot believe I haven’t written about Ala Wai before considering how much I love the place. Anyway! My friends told me about the Ala Wai Genki project but today was the first time I saw it in person. They take volunteers and meet every first Saturday of the month so if you’re in Honolulu around that time, go make some mud balls and help clean up the waters!

If you zoom in, you’ll see that all of that is fish!

Then I headed towards Pearl City to visit United BJJ for the big event: Self defense for Hawaiian teenagers taught by the very great Angela Lee Pucci! My definition of success is very generous, even if nobody shows up the fact that I show up means that the event was a success. But aside from me there were actual Hawaiian teens interested in learning self-defense through our collaboration!

[https://www.instagram.com/p/DGrdllTPkGG/](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGrdllTPkGG/)

It’s wildly cool that we can kinda… Make anything happen in our lives. I love helping the youth and I love jiu jitsu, and somehow through a series of lucky encounters I became a bridge for those two to connect in Hawaii. Many of the teens are interested in continuing training and I have no doubt they will kick some SERIOUS ass, aside from being able to defend not only themselves but other vulnerable people!

It was also a very educational event for me, not just because of the material that was taught but because it showed me how teens think in this day and age, especially teens who never considered self defense or martial arts. It’s easy to teach kids who are engaged enough to come train on their own, but kids who need that extra encouragement to come try it out, how are they thinking about all of this and how do they engage in training? I got valuable experience in observing how kids operate and it will be helpful for me in the next run of similar programs.

Did I mention there were people asking for future iterations of this class? How awesome is that?

After the event I headed towards Foster Botanical Garden. I wrote about why this is important here ([Read full story](https://julylifecoach.substack.com/p/sri-lanka-myanmar-hawaii))

Now that I know how important this garden is, it was a great honor to meditate under the bodhi tree here; it’s literally the descendent of the same tree I meditated under in India.https://www.instagram.com/p/DGtQ9GdRnE8/?img\_index=1

I meditated at the tree and bowed at the Buddha. It felt great to be this peaceful. After that I had multiple options but I chose to do one thing and turn in early: take surfing lessons.

I always get my lessons at Moku Surf Shop in Waikiki, they’ve always been helpful in developing my surfing skill. Yesterday was no different; I caught so many waves yesterday even with high tide conditions thanks to my teacher. I have a crazy muscle ache today because of that, but hey — better than not having surfed at all.

Then I wrote a very depressing article (lol) and went to bed. Today I had a lot of things happen too, but I think they deserve a bit more thought before writing so I’ll let them rest in my head for today.",1,1740981403.0,u_julylifecoach,0,1.0,False

Lemme me know which one is KittyXYuri,"There are several types of meet-cute moments in rom-coms, each setting up different dynamics for the romance. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. The Accidental Collision

The classic “bumping into each other” moment—literally! Spilled coffee, dropped books, or a tangled mess of belongings make for an awkward but endearing introduction.

Example: Two strangers crash into each other at a busy intersection, sending papers flying everywhere.


2. The Mistaken Identity

One character confuses the other for someone else, leading to a funny (or embarrassing) situation.

Example: A woman mistakes a stranger for her blind date and starts talking like they’ve met before.


3. The Enemies at First Sight

They instantly dislike each other, whether due to competition, clashing personalities, or a misunderstanding. But that tension? It turns into attraction later.

Example: They both reach for the last book at a bookstore and start arguing over who saw it first.


4. The Forced Proximity

They’re stuck together in an unavoidable situation—delayed flights, a shared Uber, a work project, or even being handcuffed together (yes, it happens).

Example: Two strangers end up seated next to each other on a long flight, forced to make conversation.


5. The Saving Grace

One character helps the other in a moment of distress, instantly creating a connection.

Example: A guy helps a woman escape an awkward conversation with an ex by pretending to be her date.


6. The ""I Know You From Somewhere""

They recognize each other but can’t quite place from where, leading to curiosity and eventual realization.

Example: They were childhood friends but haven’t seen each other in years.


7. The Wrong Place, Right Time

A misunderstanding or bad situation leads to something unexpectedly romantic.

Example: One is caught trespassing in a private garden, only to realize it belongs to the other.


8. The Matchmaker’s Setup Gone Wrong

A friend or family member sets them up, but the date goes completely off the rails.

Example: A blind date goes terribly, but they run into each other again in an unexpected setting.


9. The Shared Obsession

They meet through a mutual love for something—books, music, a specific hobby—leading to an instant connection.

Example: Both reach for the same rare vinyl record at a music store.


10. The One-Sided Crush

One person has been secretly admiring the other for a while, and their first meeting is either adorable or a total disaster.

Example: The barista finally works up the courage to talk to their longtime customer.

When we met, you stole the focus and told me you had inappropriate sexual feelings for me. You asked me not to tell my wife. I told her before I reached the car and she forgave you.

On that day, before I left, I sat with you for an hour, supported you and tried to find a way to stay friends despite not returning your feelings. I was kind to you despite everything. All on a day when we were supposed to be talking about my feelings of depression which almost resulted in me taking my own life.

And then you lied to my friends to protect your shame. You told them it was me who expressed feelings for you, that I had been demanding and cruel to you. You ignored my wife's kind efforts to speak to you. You played the victim with your crocodile tears. One or two of them believed you, and you let them.

You are selfish. You are disgusting. You are sub-human. You are a monster. I hope you never have kids. I hope he leaves you. It's only a matter of time. 

I will never forgive you and I lied when I said I had.

I hope you are miserable for the rest of your life you selfish piece of shit. Fuck you and how fucking dare you.

***If you met yourself for the first time, what would you notice about yourself?***

What makes it fun is when you add a situation or context to the prompt. Some examples:

* If I see myself having coffee: I would notice the polite mannerisms and that I am very comfortable just enjoying a book with my coffee.
* If I speak with myself at a networking event: I probably won’t be too impressed with myself because I tend to be slow to warm up to people I don’t know, so the conversation may be stale.
* If I speak with myself on a bus: The conversation would be pretty fun. I feel relatively comfortable talking to strangers in a non-professional environment.

It’s a fun exercise that also has actionable learnings.

I know I should get better at networking, especially now that I have my own business. This prompt really nailed home the idea, enough that I want to put myself out there to get more practice.

1j2br5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1j2br5o/this_is_how_i_was_finally_able_to_get_5_days_off/,This is how I was finally able to get 5 days off FF’s and Focus & Flows with minimal WD’s,"What’s up fellow quitters! This sub has helped in in so many ways over the course of my recovery from this garbage, I have taken so much from it but have given very little. So I figured I’d share my progress so far in hopes it might help even one person still struggling. 

A little backstory, well now after proof reading it it’s a LONG backstory lol… I was hooked on Kratom that started 3 years ago. I started super low dose as it helped me stay sober from a years long alcohol addiction. I have also never had any other addiction issues at all other than alcohol. I also never knew about withdrawals or anything of that sort with Kratom because, well, I guess I was too stupid to do any research and I trusted that it was just a plant like coffee as it was told to me at the store where I first bought it. Naturally it escalated a bit but never really had any negative effects on me at all besides a few nights here and there of bad sleep and GI/Gut issues, so it never really got out of control. I own a very successful real estate company, I am 14 years married to the love of my life, have 3 beautiful kids, I hit the gym every day and it helped me get shit done. 

Fast forward a year and a half and I find these stupid ass Feel Free and Kanva Focus and Flow “All Natural and safe” feel good tonics. I knew they had Kratom and Kava in them and heard FF was fermented, but had zero idea the hell I was about to endure. 

As likely with most all of you, I started at 1-2 a day and ended up at around 15 a day at $10 a piece on top of it. It destroyed everything with my health. GI and gut issues, skin issues, extremely bad eye issues, breathing issues, sinus issues, numbness in my left arm, prostate issues and so much more. It got so bad I would get extremely sick when I took them, but would get even sicker when I didn’t. Not to mention the hell I have put my family and my finances through on this garbage. 

I tried cold turkey a few times, and it was pure hell. I made it to day 2 and literally wanted to die. I can handle physical withdrawals all day, coming off alcohol is no walk in the park at all physically. It’s the mental withdrawals that I couldn’t handle. The extreme and crippling anxiety was insane. I would pace around my house all night long in a constant state of panic. I tried warm baths, helper meds (which only made it worse), meditating, listening to music, playing actual music on my guitar, everything and couldn’t shake it. Then there’s the impending doom, depression and feeling of worthlessness. It was the most awful thing I have ever experienced in my life. I  know it’s only “3 or 4 days to a week or two max” I have read, but I am, again, a business owner, father, and husband and just cannot take that kind of time off life. It just wasn’t an option. I tried everything under the sun as well, from tapering the Feel Frees, switching back to Kratom and tapering, getting Kava from a Kava bar to mix with Kratom powder. I tried skipping days, locking myself in the house/have my wife take all the funds and go everywhere with me. None of it worked. 

So I had heard from many people in this sub, and also in the Quitting Suboxone sub that Suboxone was the answer. Now let me please preface what I am going to say next. I am by no means a doctor, nor is this any sort of medical advice. This was my LAST and ONLY resort. I did extensive research on the pros and many cons of Suboxone, as should anyone contemplating this route. I have read the WD’s from prolonged Suboxone use are way worse than FF’s if not done correctly due to its long half life*** 

So currently I’m at day 5 off everything besides the subs and it has been so very tolerable. In fact my day 2 I was feeling almost completely myself again. I had my energy back, my feelings and emotions, the zombie fog brain was gone, I actually slept a bit more than I had in months and months. The only thing that was and is still a little off is/was my body temp regulation and broken sleep. As I mentioned I did sleep, but would sleep a couple hours, get up for 30 min - an hour then sleep a couple more hours and then get up for the day. The first 3 nights I would wake up completely soaking wet in sweat, to the point my wife and I would have to change the sheets and my clothes  in the middle of the night. Then during the day I was always cold, and I’m literally never cold. But today at day 5 I can happily say this has been the best day yet. I haven’t had a single thought or craving to go get one, and even day 1-4 I didn’t have many cravings at all, and when I did they only lasted a short minute or two. I hit the gym the last 3 mornings and crushed it, I have gotten more work done in the last 4 days than I have in the last month. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I still have a TON of work to do on myself, so please know that I know very well about the “pink cloud” and I am not out of the woods yet at all. I am seeing a counselor 2 times a week, I am exercising daily both physically and mentally at the gym and with a mind game and meditation app. I just wanted to post this to say that to anyone that just cannot kick it, for whatever reason - work, the shitty withdrawals, family obligations, etc., this could be something to look in to, but only as the absolute last resort. 

It is also very important to note… docs will try and start you on a ridiculously high dose, I have seen 16mg/day, 12mg, hell even 4mg a day is WAY too much. I inducted according a guide I found on the Suboxone sub which you can search for, the first day I started at 0.25mg, waited 90 minutes, then took 0.5 mg, waited a couple hours and took another 0.5 mg until I got up to 2mg. I leveled out on that for 4 days. I am now going down 25% every 4 days, which is about the time it takes to level off until I am completely off. I already went down from 2 mg, to 1.5 mg today and have felt nothing at all. And again I went from 15 FF’s/Focus & Flows a day to 1.5 mg Suboxone in 5 days and had very, very minor physical withdrawals on day 1, zero mental WD’s. 

Again I know this is long but when I was up for nights on end all I could do was read posts like these to get me through the hard times and take my mind off the suck, so I hope this may help even just one person still shackled to this bullshit. Feel free to message me with any questions. It’s a long road ahead but all we can do is take it day by day. Keep up the good fight y’all, everyone’s recovery journey is different. Pick what works for you and get to work. But I promise you, it does get better whichever journey may be. 

***Edit, also if you have any fuck you money left after this insanely expensive addiction, which I surely don’t, but… there is also an option to get a shot called sublocade if for any reason you have a hard time getting off Suboxone and it’s a life saver from what I hear. That is more for people that start on extremely high doses and can’t taper down, or people that are super to Suboxone and even at low doses tapering makes them sick. The issue is even with insurance, which not all do cover it, it can be $200 - $400 a shot, and without insurance it’s $1200 - $3000 a shot depending on where you get it, and you could need 4-6 shots, again depending on your usage. I don’t plan on having to go this route at all as again I will not be on Suboxone long enough to become dependent on it.*** end extremely long rant. ",1,1740980557.0,Quittingfeelfree,0,1.0,False

For those of you who remember me and have been following my journey since June 2024, welcome back. Hope you’ve been learning and experimenting and well along your curing journey. For those new here, what’s up. I’ve been going fucking hard at this shit for a while.

June - November I was so strict that everyone thought I was insane. Like my daily meals and lifestyle were so on point it was like I was in the military or some shit. December up until now, I’ve been falling off. Drinking here and there, eating out, haven’t gotten sun cause it’s winter time, just stupid things. Overall, have still been strict on the diet and Darko’s protocol. But need to be back at 100% FORCE.

Anyways, still well along my curing journey. Have only had 2 outbreaks so far since starting the cleanse back in June, so not bad. I’ve noticed I don’t really have any triggers for outbreaks, they just randomly fuckin happen.

I still believe that my time is coming. Just have to stay at it. We all start our curing journey hoping to cure this shit just a couple months doing some type of regimen, but unfortunately that isn’t the case. This will take several months if not 1-2 years maybe (depending on how toxic and strict you are). It’s just the harsh truth. Some of you will never cure yourselves cause you won’t fully dedicate yourselves to it cause “it’ll take too long”.

Anything worth having in life takes sacrifice. I spent my whole fucking summer last year doing nothing but work, get sun, and follow my overall regimen like a God. Didn’t hangout with friends, go out, anything. Kept to myself. If you can’t manage to say no to going out to eat or no to going out to drink or no to anything bad for you, then sorry you’re fucked. You won’t cure or accomplish anything.

I went hard for 5 months straight and fell off the last 2 months cause I was coping with coffee or sometimes nicotine and just overall being a pussy. Now I’ve been back at it. Shits mentally exhausting man trust me, I get it. It’s easy to crack sometimes. But you gotta just get over it and push on. 

One thought that keeps me going is “What other choice do we even have?” It’s either bitch about herpes and have it for the rest of your life and be miserable, or at least TRY to do something about it and GIVE IT YOUR ALL. 

The amount of information I’ve learned, books I’ve read, articles, the people I’ve paid money to talk to, the money I’ve spent on supplements, real life experience with these diets, HAS BEEN INSANE. I’m just as pissed off and tired as you guys man, especially being given the wrong information on this wonderful subject we call herpes. 

No one’s coming to save you, you must save yourself. Start your journey if you haven’t already. Ask people questions. Learn. TRY MOTHER FUCKER. This is a fight for your life back and it won’t be very easy. Well, it can be, but it all depends on YOU.

For those of you who are still lost on what to do, or where to start, the only thing I can really tell you is to look up Darko Velcek on YouTube or Rumble. Go on his website and learn. He has everything there on how the human body TRULY works. Email him if you must. He is one of the main keys to all of this. Not Yahki, not Chris, not AaJonus, not James, not Dr. Sebi, NONE of these people. I’ve done my due diligence and tried and learned all their shit. Personal experience and facts beat anything and everything.

Good luck to you all. Happy to answer any questions you may have.

How to Stay in Control – Sunday Night Musings from a GMAT Tutor,"The prep is done. The drills are behind you. But as test day gets closer, that creeping anxiety tries to make itself at home. This isn’t about luck; it’s about control. And control starts with a game plan.

Excerpts from my post here, on Anxiety from a few weeks ago - [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1ilknt8/breaking_down_test_anxiety_causes_how_to_gauge_it/)

# Test Day Game Plan: Stay in Control

**Don’t Let Anything Affect You.** Your focus is your power—nothing else matters today.

**1. If You’re Testing at a Center:**

* **Book Smart:** Schedule your exam so you have at least **3 hours after waking up** before heading out.
* **Fuel Right:** Stick to a **bland, reliable breakfast**—**today is not the day to experiment.** Coffee + slow-release energy foods (bananas, eggs, oats) will keep you steady.
* **Move Your Body:** Go for a run in the morning or do a quick workout to channel that pumped-up energy.
* **Avoid Driving:** Take a cab or have someone drop you off. You don’t need that extra stress.
* **Arrive 45 Minutes Early:** Find a **quiet spot or a nearby coffee shop** and warm up with **10-15 easy-to-medium Quant & CR questions**—**don’t check answers.** The GMAT’s algorithm makes the first few questions count, so the **exam should not be your first problem of the day.**
* **Ignore the Test Center Drama:** The registration process is **exhausting**, and test center staff can be… well, let’s just say *power-hungry*. Don’t let their attitude throw you off. Stay polite, stay detached, and focus on your game.
* **Check Your Setup:** Once at your desk, make sure:
   * Your **wet marker works** and your scratch pad is clean.
   * The **mouse is smooth** (no grit, no lag).
   * The **screen is clear** (no smudges or glare).
   * If they allow **earplugs**, use them.
   * Dress warm—the **center will be cold, and anxiety will make it worse.**
* **Pre-Test Breathing:** As you go through instructions, use the extra time before selecting your test order for **breathing exercises**. Bring your **resting heart rate down**—calm mind, sharp focus.
* **First Question = Key to Momentum** The first question **sets the tone** for the rest of the exam. Approach it carefully, but don’t obsess over perfection—just **get into your flow.**
* **Stay Locked In:** Ignore distractions. Focus on **one question at a time** and ensure you **complete all sections.**

**2. If You’re Testing at Home (Online):**

* Same rules apply—except no commute.
* **Clear your table** and place your **phone behind you.**
* **Ignore proctor drama.** Some of them love to throw their weight around. Don’t let it get to you—it’s not worth it.

Your job? **Stay calm, stay sharp, and execute your plan**

# How to Mitigate Test Anxiety

Now that we understand how to gauge them - lets talk about few things which we can do to mitigate any test anxiety we may have.

**1. Reframe Your Mindset: Shift from Fear to Challenge**

* **Adopt a Growth Mindset:** Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures. Focus on progress, not perfection.
* **Normalize Anxiety:** Even top scorers feel test anxiety. Reframe it as excitement—your body is preparing to perform.
* **Replace Negative Thoughts with Affirmations:**
   * Instead of *“I’m bad at tests,”* say *“I’m improving with practice.”*
   * Instead of *“If I fail, my life is over,”* say *“This is just one step in my journey.”*

**2. Prepare Smarter, Not Harder**

* **Simulate Real Test Conditions:** Take timed, adaptive practice tests to build endurance and get used to GMAT dynamics. Take practice tests away from home so you learn to cope with the challenges of a foreign environment.
* **Optimize Study Techniques:**
   * Use **active recall** and **spaced repetition** to reinforce concepts.
   * Develop **strategic elimination** and **decision-making skills** to work efficiently under pressure.

**3. Manage Physical & Emotional Stress**

* **Mindfulness & Breathing:** Try box breathing—inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4.
* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):** Tense and release each muscle group to relieve tension.
* **Exercise & Nutrition:** Prioritize hydration, avoid caffeine overload, and opt for **low-intensity, longer workouts** over short, high-intensity ones.

**4. Build Confidence Through Small Wins**

* **Keep a Success Journal:** After each study session, jot down one thing that went well.
* **Celebrate Progress:** Focus on incremental improvements—every step forward counts.

**5. Stay Calm During the Exam**

* Use the **5-4-3-2-1 grounding method:** Name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste.
* Take **one slow breath** before tackling a tough question.
* If overwhelmed, **pause for 30 seconds**—doodle, reflect on life, or think about family. A mental reset can bring fresh perspective.

She and I have been particularly close through the years due to common interests and similar friendship values. Since graduating, we have lived about 1.5 hours away from each other. She has gotten married and has had 2 children (pregnant with a 3rd) since then. I was present during her first pregnancy and birth, but not much after that. I have gone through a lot of trauma in that time (foreshadowing - caregiving for my sick grandma, her dying, partner cheating, partner deployed overseas, caregiving for other grandparent, etc). Every few months, I would message her falling on the sword saying I knew that I was not being the friend she deserved (I wasn’t) but I was clear about everything going on, not as an excuse, but hopefully informing her about why I was absent. I would send her money for the babies for Christmas and their birthdays from me (which sucks, but better than nothing). I drove to see the fam several times, meeting for breakfast at 7:30am or coffee at the house working around sleep and nap schedules for the kids. During this tough time, I had her on my “close friends” on Instagram. I am very open on that channel so to speak. I would post my very candid thoughts, pictures, fears, etc, particularly about my grandma. My friend knew that my grandma was my mother at one point in my life, and she was one of the most important people to me. I chronicled her illness that spanned over 1.5 years on my close friends, and she saw everything. Hospital visits that spanned a week at a time, sick at home, my sadness, my grandma being sent in an ambulance, etc. When she passed away (almost a year ago as of posting), my friend sent me an Instagram message saying “she will be missed tremendously” but did not text, call, anything. No appearance at her funeral. Given my relationship with my grandma, which she knew about, this response was dismissive to say the least. Not only knowing my relationship with her, but knowing me since I was 18 years old and everything else I had been through,  I did not respond. No flowers, no follow up text or message, nothing, just radio silence. We have not spoken since then and I have no desire to. This has been a deal breaker for me.

She’s a DJ and off the bat she was saying we should be FWB and invited me to
one of her shows the following week. When I went to her show the next week is when I actually realized how interested in her I was, we ended up hanging out a couple nights later we went to dinner and I spent the night at her house. We stayed up pretty late and woke up the next day in the middle of the afternoon. She had a show the next day and had invited me but I could tell something was off the next morning. She was on the phone with her manager all morning and said we should go get coffee but then ended up saying that I should leave because she needed to get ready for her show. I texted her later that day asking her where the venue was at that she playing at and never got a response. I ended up showing up anyway because I got the address from instagram and said hi to her there but she looked uncomfortable seeing me there. I texted her the next day trying to ask what was wrong and she kept on ghosting me. Called a couple times to no avail and then she ended up blocking my number and instagram. I don’t know what I was thinking at the time but I thought it was a good idea to show up at her door asking why she blocked me and if we could work things out, she said she has called the police on me and told me she would never give me another chance again. I know this was the dumbest idea but I didn’t have any bad intentions, I just wanted to talk to her and fix things. She had blocked me on everything so I thought that was the only way. Fast forward to March I see her on the same app that we met on and messaged her there just saying “Hey” she responded saying she couldn’t do this again and that I had been too clingy. I apologized about showing up to her house and we ended up hooking up that night and things went really well. A week later I texted her asking if she wanted to hang again and a couple nights later she did. Things ended up fizzling out somehow after that with her saying that she wasn’t feeling our sex anymore and she stopped responding to my texts. Fast forward to July I see her on the app again and message her, we end up texting back and forth for a little bit and hookup again, although she was telling me that she strictly wants to only hookup with me and have me leave right after. About a week and a half after we hooked up I texted her again saying we should hookup again and she texted me back saying that she isn’t physically attracted to me anymore and tells me that she’s talking to someone else and that we should go our separate ways for good. I tell her I thought you didn’t want a relationship with someone and she says that she meant she specifically didn’t want one with me. I try telling her that I’m a different person from before and that I’ve changed but she tells me that someone can’t change in 4-6 months. She tells me that if I show up to her place again  she’ll have me arrested and blocks me again. Fast forward to last week and see her on the same dating app again and I hit her up just saying “Hey” she replies “Hi again haha” and I ask her how she’s been and she says she’s been good and just focusing on music and that she broke up with her bf a few days ago. I replied asking if she’s still playing shows every weekend and she says that she now only does bigger booking and out of state shows. I reply saying “I know you work hard so that’s cool to see it paying off” and I tell her what I’ve been up to, that I’m graduating this spring and that I’m pursuing a master’s degree next year. I don’t get a response. I wait a day and then say “When are you free this week, you should come over” still no response. I’m at a crossroads right now and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to throw in the towel just yet because I feel like I could get this girl if she just gave me a real chance. We had a good thing going when we first met and I know I fucked it up but I’m just trying to get back to that. For context her profile on the dating app implies she’s looking for hookups so that’s why I said what I said. I’m a good looking guy and we’ve had really good sex in the past so obviously there is a bigger issue. I’m at a crossroads with this girl, I know the next thing I text has to be perfect or I could lose out on her, because she’s the type who will block you. I’m divided between sending on the app “Hey I just wanted to be honest with you, Ik you have your own life and I have mine. I really did enjoy the time we spent together. 
I liked hooking up with you and everything but I felt more of a connection between us than just hooking up.
I hope we can just hang out as friends, it doesn’t have to be physical. If you don’t want that I won’t bother you again” or “I don’t want there to be negative energy between us I just want us to be cool” or texting her on my new phone number that I’m not blocked on “Yo it’s “Name” new number I’m in town let’s do something tonight” help me figure out what to do Reddit I really want something with this girl and know that if I was able to hang out with her a few times I could get her to fall for me.",2,1740980092.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

We live 2 hours apart, I know it's not crazy long distance but just hear me out

At first, things were great, we were meeting up halfway, calling / texting frequently and I felt really close to her but in the past few months, her schedule became really hectic (due to things out of her control) and we hardly talk like how we used to. Because she's so busy, I've been the one doing all the commuting driving to her multiple times a month and tbh it is starting to burn me out.

Anyways, it's not like I don't care about her or anything. We've never fought, we've never had an argument. She's sweet, optimistic, and we get along really well together, but the distance combined with how much planning it takes just to see each other makes me feel so disconnected. I miss the little things like grabbing coffee after work, spontaneous dates, or casual hangouts without having to plan days in advance.

I fear the distance is starting to feel more like a chore. But I did go into this relationship with an open mind. I did not feel this way when we first started dating.

She's also been very overwhelmed lately so I've been understanding and supportive but even so, I feel like I'm putting my own feelings aside because I feel guilty adding to her stress. I feel like I'm loosing myself trying to not make her sad or upset. That's the last thing I want to do. If there was some sort of toxicity in our relationship, I feel like I wouldn't be struggling so much with these thoughts.

I'm just torn because nothing is wrong with her, it's not a personality thing. I just feel now I'm forcing this to work because I feel bad. Idk if this is a normal phase in LDRs, or if I'm gaslighting myself into ignoring how much this is affecting me

**Additional context:**

1. our visits are one day visits, we can't spend weekends due to culture / familial reasons. **My entire DAY trip totals over 4 hours,** and that's being generous if there's no traffic. And we only hang out for a few hours.
2. she always tells me how much of an amazing bf I am, and how she's never had anyone care for her the ways that I have (this feels like a punch to the gut)
3. since we've been together, she tells me I've helped her love herself, she's been more confident, and she's been trying a lot of new things because of me

So now I'm just stuck. I don't want to be her first heart break, but in it all, I feel like I'm breaking myself for her sake. I'd rather me hurt than her. And it hurts, because she says this is the happiest she's ever been.",1,1740979774.0,LDR,2,1.0,False

1j2bg67,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1j2bg67/question_about_developing_taste_everybody_seems/,Question about developing taste: everybody seems to love acidity but I don’t think I do?,"I’m looking for advice but also just curious about other people’s taste preferences and if they’ve changed over time.

Context:
I’ve been using my Chemex for years, often with beans from specialty roasters, but only recently started to get into experimenting with dialing in to get the best flavors.

I’ve found that I seem to prefer my coffee way more extracted than many recipes suggest. I like to grind pretty fine, and the Chemex’s slow drawdowns seem to help create the body that I like. When I try to go even a bit coarser, I find the coffee tastes quite acidic to me in a way I don’t like. Of course the ideal grind size can vary a bit depending on the bean and the roast level, but overall I always prefer finer grinds.

But the sense I get is that many people, including the educators (Lance Hedrick, James Hoffman), really value acidity, and bringing it out in the coffee seems to be part of the goal of a well-done brew. It’s made me wonder if this is an acquired taste I could be developing, or if there’s a world of beans that have much less acidity that I would enjoy more and I should just keep my focus there.

I do love lighter roast beans that have acidic/fruity tasting notes listed, but I like them with a much more balanced extraction that is neither sour nor bitter, but leans bitter if anything.

So I’m wondering if there’s anyone else who really doesn’t like acidity but still loves chasing these delicious cups with really nice beans, and if you are such a person, if you have any tips for me of what kinds of beans to try. I know a lot of this can be subjective but I also have a sense that there are ways that different beans really shine.

TLDR: Is liking acidity an acquired taste that anyone who wants to learn more about coffee should learn to appreciate? Or is it just a preference that seems to be prevalent among pourover experts? And if a preference, where are the non-acidic people hanging out?

1j2bfya,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1j2bfya/petty_revenge_served_cold/,Petty revenge served cold,"I'm a gay man, age 38. I've been through a lot in life, enough to make me realize what truly matters to me in life, friends, and relationships. I have a pretty modern view on relationships, and have come to realize that to me, sex and relationships are not mutually inclusive. What does matter to me is trust, openness, and honesty. If a guy I'm dating wants to sleep with someone else, I'm confident enough in myself and what I have to offer a guy that he'll come back to me, so as long as he's open and tells me about it, as long as he follows a few conditions I have, he can go nuts and have his fun. It doesn't bother me. There's a lot more important things in a relationship than monogamous sex. Long as my needs are being met, I can stay loyal to the guy I choose to be with, and if it makes him happy to sleep with others, well... if he's happy, I'm happy. However, he starts being shady and hiding it from me, there's a problem. 

I have an ex who decided it was a good idea to hide his dalliances on me. I'm the son of a therapist. My entire childhood was an in depth lesson in behavioral psychology. I'm VERY good at reading people and I can tell when something's off, and once something being off is on my radar, I WILL find out what it is.  He wasn't very good at hiding his tracks though, and through a little snooping, spying, and just watching his general behavior, it didn't take long to find out that  he was seeing 3 other guys behind my back. When I'm willing to give someone free reign to do as they want as long as they're open an honest with me about it, hiding it and not telling me about it not only breaks my trust, but really gets me angry. 

When I get angry, I don't get mad, I get creative. I also firmly believe in petty revenge. So I stay calm, cool, and collected, and come up with ways to make people really regret getting on my bad side. This particular ex of mine was really big into cars, and had a 2010 corvette that was his baby. He had no clue I knew about his extracurricular relations yet, so he had no reason to have his guard up around me. And so he never saw it coming when I dumped an entire box of ultra absorbent tampons in the corvette's gas tank. For those unfamiliar with gas tanks, there's a screen inside the tank that prevent any debris in the tank from getting to the engine, and tampons are made to absorb things. So they would essentially suck up all the gas in his tank, yet as gas gauges work by how heavy the gas tank is, it would appear there was always more gas in the tank than there actually was. It took all I had not to cackle like the wicked witch of the west when he called me and asked me to bring him some gas as he ran out when he was on the express way. I tell him I can't because I'm busy at work and can't leave, so he ends up being stuck on the side of the express way for 3 hours waiting for someone to bring him gas. He also ran out again later on in the week, before he decided to have the corvette looked at. While I never admitted to doing it, he did suddenly decide to take me on a very expensive weekend get away at a very nice hotel with a pool suite. So I was pretty sure he knew it was me, and since things were good between me and him otherwise, I didn't break it off and thought he learned his lesson. 

Of course that wasn't the case.

A few weeks later, I catch on that he's still sneaking around behind my back, and the gas tank episode wasn't enough to teach him his lesson. So me, still being the kind nice person who would never do anything petty when I'm mad, sign up my ex on a BDSM website, and make a post saying something along the lines of ""I'm new here, but I'm very much into humiliation and degradation. I'm looking for a master or mistress to call me and make me feel like the piece of shit that I am."" It doesn't take long to get responses from people willing to play the part of master/mistress. One of them was particularly vile and mean, and after exchanging a few messages to make sure this Mistress was the perfect one, I gave her his number and made sure to state that hanging up was part of the fun, and that she should keep calling back no matter how many hang ups there were. She really liked the sound of this and agreed. To say this woman was relentless was an understatement, and I couldn't have been happier with how much effort she put in. Whenever my ex would have enough of messages and calls from her, she'd block the number, only to have her start up on a different number. After a day of this, he turned off his phone and the next day had his number changed. 

A few days later me and him were talking and he finally asked why anyone would do that to him. I just turn, and look him in the eyes with a very cold look on my face and say something along the lines of ""Probably some guy who found out his boyfriend was fucking around with three other guys behind his back even though his boyfriend knows as long as he's open about it there's no issue."" To say the color drained out of his face is an understatement. Casper the friendly ghost would've looked tan next to my ex. When he finally speaks all he can say is ""Oh... you know."" I merely nod, still giving him a look that could freeze the Sahara Desert over before I say ""Mmhmm. I do. And now thanks to you hiding it from me, so do your other fuck boys. Now grab your shit and get the fuck out, I never want to see you again."" Within 5 minutes he has his stuff collected and is out the door and out of my life. 

The sad part of all of this is that he knew I'm very patient and very petty when I'm mad. We'd met at a job where my supervisor at the time did me dirty. That's a story for another time, but to make a long story short, I found it's very easy to find someone's address on the internet, and even easier, disturbingly so, to arrange an appointment to be visited by Mormon Missionaries at 7 am on a Wednesday. I don't care how religious someone is, no one wants to hear about the wonders of the lord and savior Jesus Christ before morning coffee, and my supervisor was no exception to this. Let's just say he never bothered me again for the rest of the time I kept that job. My ex thought I was an evil genius for this, so he had to know he was playing with some dangerous explosive going behind my back. 

All this happened a few years back, so I hope he he's learned his lesson and doesn't try this with other guys... but since a tiger can't change its stripes, I doubt it. He had it good with me, so his loss, not mine. And now after taking that walk down memory lane, time to have a drink to stupid exes and petty revenge. Cheers!

I don’t know what I was thinking at the time but I thought it was a good idea to show up at her door asking why she blocked me and if we could work things out, she said she has called the police on me and told me she would never give me another chance again. I know this was the dumbest idea but I didn’t have any bad intentions, I just wanted to talk to her and fix things. She had blocked me on everything so I thought that was the only way. Fast forward to March I see her on the same app that we met on and messaged her there just saying “Hey” she responded saying she couldn’t do this again and that I had been too clingy. I apologized about showing up to her house and we ended up hooking up that night and things went really well. A week later I texted her asking if she wanted to hang again and a couple nights later she did. Things ended up fizzling out somehow after that with her saying that she wasn’t feeling our sex anymore and she stopped responding to my texts. Fast forward to July I see her on the app again and message her, we end up texting back and forth for a little bit and hookup again, although she was telling me that she strictly wants to only hookup with me and have me leave right after. About a week and a half after we hooked up I texted her again saying we should hookup again and she texted me back saying that she isn’t physically attracted to me anymore and tells me that she’s talking to someone else and that we should go our separate ways for good. I tell her I thought you didn’t want a relationship with someone and she says that she meant she specifically didn’t want one with me. I try telling her that I’m a different person from before and that I’ve changed but she tells me that someone can’t change in 4-6 months. She tells me that if I show up to her place again  she’ll have me arrested and blocks me again. Fast forward to last week and see her on the same dating app again and I hit her up just saying “Hey” she replies “Hi again haha” and I ask her how she’s been and she says she’s been good and just focusing on music and that she broke up with her bf a few days ago. I replied asking if she’s still playing shows every weekend and she says that she now only does bigger booking and out of state shows. I reply saying “I know you work hard so that’s cool to see it paying off” and I tell her what I’ve been up to, that I’m graduating this spring and that I’m pursuing a master’s degree next year. I don’t get a response. I wait a day and then say “When are you free this week, you should come over” still no response. I’m at a crossroads right now and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to throw in the towel just yet because I feel like I could get this girl if she just gave me a real chance. We had a good thing going when we first met and I know I fucked it up but I’m just trying to get back to that. For context her profile on the dating app implies she’s looking for hookups so that’s why I said what I said. I’m a good looking guy and we’ve had really good sex in the past so obviously there is a bigger issue. I’m at a crossroads with this girl, I know the next thing I text has to be perfect or I could lose out on her, because she’s the type who will block you. I’m divided between sending on the app “Hey I just wanted to be honest with you, Ik you have your own life and I have mine. I really did enjoy the time we spent together. 
I liked hooking up with you and everything but I felt more of a connection between us than just hooking up.
I hope we can just hang out as friends, it doesn’t have to be physical. If you don’t want that I won’t bother you again” or “I don’t want there to be negative energy between us I just want us to be cool” or texting her on my new phone number that I’m not blocked on “Yo it’s “Name” new number I’m in town let’s do something tonight” help me figure out what to do Reddit I really want something with this girl and know that if I was able to hang out with her a few times I could get her to fall for me.",1,1740979030.0,textadvice,0,1.0,False

I bought my Vertuo Plus in January and have been very happy with it :D

The flavor has been delicious and i could taste the difference between each pod (mostly barista creations), but these days all the pods are starting to taste the same :(

They all have a very strong and bitter coffee taste to them, and don't taste like how they used to anymore.

I always do the 3 button press wash after around 4 cups, so the only thing i can think of is to maybe decalc it?

But the saleswoman told me i only have to do that once a year, so can that really be it?

We lost touch for about 25 years and re-connected on Classmates.com.  She now has dementia, falls about 3 times a month, and takes prescription medication to knock herself out. She came up to help when I was having surgery and was supposed to be my driver but she stayed up late, took Ambien, then was out of it in the morning and couldn’t take me. Thankfully, my daughter was there also and she drove. We rented an AirBnB, she took Ambien again, and spilled coffee on a chair and didn’t tell anyone, and made a big mess in the kitchen, didn’t clean up after her dogs. I picked up 2 plastic grocery bags of dog sht for her so the owner wouldn’t complain. The owner was pizzed about the chair and all the dog hair. This friend let her dogs run loose in the neighbors yards, they almost ran into the road, and one of them put a big scratch down a ladies beautiful shiny black SUV!  On a cruise we went on, she didn’t control her diabetes, had a major BS crash, and we couldn’t get into her cabin. On another cruise, she took Ambien in the morning and was so out of it, everyone had to watch her to make sure she was safe!  She totaled her car after eating CBD gummies.  Another instance she pulled out in front of a car and I thought we would be T-boned with me in the side of impact!   I planned on distancing myself after our cruise last month.  Last year we talked about going to the Irish Festival in a couple weeks. I had changed my mind after the AirBnB fiasco.  The 2nd cruise was planned a year ahead of time so I felt obligated to go.  I told her yesterday that I couldn’t go to the Irish Festival because my daughter was going to be visiting and she seemed okay with it. Now tonight I got a text basically saying she’s upset that I’m canceling and asking that I explain to my daughter that we already had plans.   I still want to stay in touch with her but I don’t think it’s safe for her to drive 2-1/2 hours to my house and back home and what if she takes Ambien again in the morning and ruins the day.

After living in the city for years and countless visits to Central Park, I thought I'd share my experience about the best ways to enter this massive 843-acre urban oasis.

I've tried pretty much every entrance, but the southeastern corner at 59th Street and 5th Avenue (Grand Army Plaza) is hands down the best starting point. Here's why:

First, it's super easy to get to - multiple subway lines stop nearby (N, R, W at 5th Ave-59th St). Plus, you're right by the iconic Plaza Hotel and the glass cube Apple Store, which makes it impossible to miss.

From this entrance, you can immediately hit up some of the park's most famous spots. The Pond is right there, and it's honestly one of the most picturesque spots with the city skyline reflecting in the water. A few steps in, and you're at the Central Park Zoo and the beautiful Victorian Gardens.

But here's the thing - Central Park is HUGE. Like, seriously huge. I learned this the hard way when I first tried to explore it all on foot. My feet were killing me after just covering a small portion of it.

That's why I started taking pedicab tours, and it completely changed my Central Park experience. These guys know all the hidden gems and movie locations (did you know Home Alone 2 filmed here?). Plus, you get to see way more in a couple of hours than you would in a full day of walking.

I recently took another tour (honestly, I take them even when friends visit), and we covered everything from Bethesda Fountain to Strawberry Fields, Belvedere Castle, and even stopped at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The guide shared some fascinating stories about each spot that you wouldn't find in guidebooks.

If you're interested in exploring the park this way, I highly recommend this tour I found: https://advenfy.com/Central-Park. The guides are super knowledgeable, and they even provide blankets during winter (trust me, you'll want those during colder months).

The best part? You can customize the tour length based on what you want to see. They'll pick you up right by a Starbucks on 6th Ave, so you can grab your coffee fix before starting the adventure.

Quick tip: Book in advance, especially during peak tourist season. The good tours fill up fast, and you don't want to end up with a random guide who doesn't know their stuff.

So yeah, while Grand Army Plaza is my recommended entrance, combining it with a guided tour is really the way to go if you want to make the most of your Central Park visit. You'll see more, learn more, and honestly, it's just more fun than wandering around with a map on your phone.

It was difficult for the first month or so but by mid-Feb, I genuinely didn't see it as a challenge or big deal. 

My win for this month is that I didn't get a Starbucks drink at all. I've generally been trying to cut back on sweet drinks in general, and the small $7 purchases add up greatly but its difficult because starbucks is a conveninent place to get a drink and do some work from. I got one in Jan but as of Mar 3rd, its been 2 full months without a coffee run! Previously I used to get coffee twice a week-ish so I estimate I saved $64 there alone :)

My small setbacks were that I had to pay a big medical bill that I couldn't afford to before and a wedding that cost a ton of money because it had events over a couple of days but these were both unavoidable so I don't count it as going against the nobuy

Other than that, I feel like a changed person after just 2-3 months of doing this. I don't browse through shops mindlessly looking for the dopamine hit anymore, I don't 'crave' new things and I've found good entertainment by shopping from myself first and amusing myself with what I already have at home.

Depending on your location in Starbucks, you can definitely have a livable wage and be comfortable (Plus your benefits and incentives).

From my first hand grinder to now my incoming electric grinder (DF64 gen2) I’ve come a long way appreciating and knowing more about coffee.  
Now the next thing is to get an espresso machine. I had a budget of 50k earlier and saw the Gaggia Classic Pro, however it lacked the temperature and pressure display which I’d like to maintain my consistent shots as well as experimenting new brews. It is possible to mod with a PID yes but I’m not comfortable with that process.  
After researching for a while more, I came across Profitec Go which costs around 1.10 L. It is a stretch from my earlier plan of 50k but I am looking at it as a one time investment for years to come. I got in touch with brewing gadgets on WhatsApp to know more about the warranty and compatibility of the machine in India and was satisfied with their response.  
I feel in this price range I have explored many options and this one sticks out to me but before I pull the trigger I would like to know from someone more knowledgeable than me or from people who are already owning this machine. I’m not comfortable to increase the budget more but I’m open to hear your recommendations & insights.  
A few preferences might help you all to know my taste better. I prefer having milk based coffee. Usually I make coffee for myself only in the house and sometimes for my parents and sister.  
  
A question I had was on the rare occassion of having a few guests let’s say 5, will this machine help to brew back to back shots in a reasonable time?   
Apart from that I’m planning on getting the red colour but that is my personal preference based on the background of the counter I plan to keep this machine on.

This story takes place in the distant past, the summer of '98. I won't go into the in depth back story, but I was living in Atlanta with this guy I'd become friends with. Living situation wasn't great, but I was happy to rent a room from him. 
I was chatting with a girl in an Internet chat room over a couple of months. Nothing too serious as she was in Toronto. 
One day he comes in while I've been chatting with her and suggests a spontaneous road trip, ""quit your job, you can get a new one when we get back, let's go and see if this is real"" etc. I grew up with a mom that would take spontaneous road trips and other irresponsible actions, but he was persuasive and eventually I agreed. We packed up some clothes, got my final paycheck, and hit the road in my 1970 Ford Econoline van.

Drive north and across the border to Canada.  I meet the girl, she is wonderful, she was an on-air radio DJ for a pop radio station and I was a drummer. We agree that we would like to try a relationship, but would need to figure out logistics. 
I'm prepared to head back to Atlanta, when the ""friend"" suggests that we could instead go out to California because he has also been chatting with a girl and she said she worked on a ranch and could get us jobs, etc. 

Since we were already on a journey, I rolled the dice and said sure let's go. We didn't really have enough funds to cover the trip and by the time we made it to Fresno,CA my money was gone. We picked up a hitchhiker on the way and he told me about a place in most major cities where you can work that day and get paid that day. I looked up the company in Fresno and immediately got to doing some day work, so we could afford Taco Bell each night. My ""friend"" spends his days hanging out at a coffee shop trying to get back in touch with the girl he had been chatting with. We are homeless and living out of my van parked in a Blockbuster parking lot at this point. 

One day, after I'd done my day labor and gotten us tacos, we were hanging out at the coffee house and looked up the street at a house that was at the end of the road. We see a bunch of people roaming around the yard, in and out of the house, some of them wearing cloaks. Cloaks in California in early summer. Something was up, and we considered the options as we drank our coffee and watched the action. 

We came up with three options. One, they could be part of a local Renaissance faire. I had worked several seasons at the Georgia Renn Faire as a juggling instructor, so if that is the case we could probably walk up there, say hi, and get along great. Or they could be pagans, both of us had studied some level of paganism, so we could probably walk up there, say hi and get along. The third option we considered was Vampires. I had never LARPed but was familiar with Vampire The Masquerade, Werewolf, and the whole World of Darkness. But we figured if that was what they were doing, we could walk up, say hi, and get along well.

So we finished our coffee and walked up the street. Turns out they were vampires. We asked if we could create some characters and jump in and they were happy to have us. We took on the roles of a couple of Gangrels, fresh off the road and new to town. It was a great night. 

About a week goes by, and my ""friend"" (who hasn't worked a day so far) tells me that the girl he was chatting with found someone else, he contacted his dad and was getting a bus ticket back to Atlanta. I had my van, which represented most of my worldly possessions. I was devastated that he was just going to take off after talking me into this road trip to begin with. Just leaving me there on my own. 

And, like that, he was gone. But after he left, this guy Scott, tells me that I could sleep on his couch. Take some time and get my shit together. He was the vampire Prince of Fresno. A struggling actor in his regular life, he offered up his home for me that summer and got me off the street. I continued playing Vampire that whole summer. I took on a new character as a Nosferatu and became part of the council. 

Eventually I got a gig as a cook for a summer camp and spent part of that summer in the Sequoia National Forest at a skateboard camp cooking for kids and living at the camp. I saved up enough money, thanked Scott for saving my life, and took off for the road again, back to Canada. But that is another story.

Pancakes were $14 as part of a deal with the coffee ($7). Was it as good as their Japan locations? Sadly no, but by LA standards it was solid.

1j2axsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j2axsw/so_about_that_whole_ai_cant_count_fingers_thing/,"So about that whole ""AI can't count fingers"" thing...","A few days ago Rob, the new intern, came into my office about three in the afternoon.  He looked pale.  Hell, he looked sick.

""Rob, damn man, you okay?"" I said, looking up from my workstation.  The newest beta for our AI Model was in the final stages of compiling.  It had been our biggest project for almost 9 months.

Rob swallowed hard.  ""I... I don't know.  I found a problem."" he said.

This caused me to raise an eyebrow.  “A problem with the new AI model?"" I asked.  If so, this could be a problem.  A lot was riding on the roll-out of this new software.

I could see Rob visibly take a moment to collect himself.  ""Not exactly.  Let me show you something.""

Rob walked over and put his laptop on my desk.  He opened it up.  ""Take a look at this.""

On the screen was an AI generated image.  The watermark and beta number for our new software was across the bottom.  It was a simple scene, a smiling blond woman eating salad.  A standard test image we used to calibrate the AI learning model.

""What's the problem?"" I asked.

""The fingers.  Look at the fingers."" Rob said.

I looked closer.  The hand holding the salad fork had six fingers.

""Rob, don't beat yourself up.  The entire AI industry has been dealing with that weird issue for a while now.  Hell, it's practically a meme at this point.""

""It's not that."" Rob said, with this odd break to his voice, and suddenly I realized Rob wasn't sick... he was scared.

""Rob, what the hell is going on?"" I asked, concerned.

Rob looked around nervously.  ""Come over here, I want you to look at something.""

I stepped over to the doorway to my office, looking out over the cubicle farm where dozens of employees were working.

Rob was scanning the cubicles, his eyes moving in a weird, darting motion.  He stopped and gestured over to one of the workers. A stocky older guy working in a desk not far from my office. ""See that one.  Eric I think his name is.""

""Eric Simmons, he's one of our database guys.  You know Eric.  He's worked here for years, as long as I have."" I said, not sure where this was going.

""Count the fingers on the hand he's using to control his mouse."" Rob said.

""Rob this is getting wei-"" I started.

""Just... trust me."" Rob said.

I sighed.  I counted the fingers on Eric's hand.  5.

""He's got 5 fingers Rob, same as you and me."" I said.  Maybe the stress of the deadline had gotten to Rob.

""Okay now... don't look directly at him.  Look... ah... there look at the motivational poster on the wall behind him.  And then, from like the edge of your vision, count the fingers."" Rob said, keeping his voice down.

""Rob listen man, this job is stressful, I get it.  Take the afternoon off, get a start on your weekend.  You've worked your ass off you deser-""

""Please"" Rob said, cutting me off.  His voice practically begging.  ""Just... do it.""

Even now I’m not 100% sure why I humored him.  I closed my eyes and blinked several times.  I focused on the poster, some generic office print, a picture of a sculling team with some trite teamwork slogan slapped below it.  Never paid it any attention.  With the picture in my focus and Eric's hand on the edges of my vision, I counted again.

Six.

I blinked.   I looked, directly looked at Eric's hand again.  5.  I counted again.  5.  Four fingers and a thumb.  No question about it.

I looked back at the poster, letting my eyes focus on a point behind it like one of those old Magic Eye pictures.  I looked at Eric's hand again.  6 fingers.  A thumb and five full other digits.

Rod could see the expression on my face.  ""You see it too, don't you?""

""I.... what the hell?"" I finally let out.

""Step back in your office with me.  I'll try to explain."" Rob said.

Back in my office Rob gestured at his laptop.  ""When I got brought on the team they asked me to look into the whole 'wrong number of fingers' problem.  So I decided to start at the most basic, run a simple pattern algorithm using a large number of pictures of hands.  So I used these."" He pointed at the screen.  It showed dozens of pictures of hands.  Hands holding plates with food.  Hands holding plastic party drink cups.  But from the background and certain faces I knew these pictures.

""The company Christmas party."" I said.

""Exactly."" Rob said.  ""They were already on the share drive, no issues with rights, and this was just a basic first test run it was never gonna get used for anything.  I really just needed some images to start out with.  So I used the base AI model we're already working on and ran them through it.  Got a bunch of pictures back with the wrong number of fingers.  But here's the thing... I don't know why.  I looked over the code.  There's no reason counting fingers should be an issue.  Like you said it's almost a meme at this point but has anyone actually stopped to ask why?  Why something that can make a photo realistic face can't count fingers?  Computers are a lot better at counting than they are at aesthetics and facial features.""

""Rob listen these AI models are some of the most complicated pieces of software ever made, we're going to be finding quirks in them for decades...."" I said, trying to convince myself as much as Rob.

""Yeah, I had the same thought.  So I did another test run.  With a dozen pictures of fake plastic hands as the base image model.  And ran it through the exact same AI Model.  Every single generated image had the proper number of fingers."" Rob said.

He bought up another set of pictures on his laptop.  Again a slideshow of dozens of pictures of hands, but all fake.  Mannequin hands, those possible wooden art hands, gloves on stands… all with the correct number of finges.

“I ran this through the exact same algorithm.  It makes zero sense why these would come out any different.”

""So Rob what are you saying?  And what does this have to do with Eric's hand?"" I asked.

Rob exhaled. ""I'm saying I don't think the AI model is generating the wrong number of fingers.  I think the AI model is right.  I think it is seeing something we're not seeing.""

I made a nervous laugh.  ""What?  Humans all have a secret hidden extra finger that AI models can see, but we can't?""

Rob didn't return the laugh.  ""Our hands are in the picture from the Christmas party.”

Involuntarily, I looked down at my hand.  5 fingers.

This time Rob did laugh.  ""I've been doing the same thing.  Staring at my hands, trying to look at it from every angle and every field of focus.  No luck.""

""So... so what does this all mean?"" I said, pulling my eyes away from my hand.

Rob shrugged.  ""I have no idea.  I don't have enough data yet to tell if this... anomaly is in everyone or not.  I'd need a sample size many factors bigger than this to even start model patterns or trends.

“Did… did everyone’s hand show the wrong number of fingers?” I asked, not sure which answer I was hoping for.

Rob shook his head.  “No.  About 1 in 10.  Eric was one of them, that’s why I pointed him out.  Doug in accounting.  Janet in HR.  And the CEO.  That’s why I came to you.  You’re the senior person who wasn’t showing the wrong number of fingers when I ran those pictures through the AI model.”

“Rob, this is insane.  It has to be a software glitch of some kind.  It’s freaky as hell, I admit but…” I trailed off, not sure how to respond.

“I know but…” Rob paused and I could see on his face he was choosing his words very carefully “I’m very good with this stuff.  If you could see the data like I do, really see the code, you’d get it.  This software is running correctly.  Something is wrong with… reality.” He looked down, perhaps a little taken by how absurd it sounded when he said it out loud.  But when he spoke again there as a powerful earnestness to his voice.  “Something is very wrong with some of the people here.” 

I took a deep breath.  To hell if he wasn’t sounding convincing in pure conviction if nothing else.  But still, what he was suggesting was crazy.  I decided to aim for a middle ground and put the ball back in his court.

“So what do you suggest with do?” I asked him.

“I don’t know yet.  I’m gonna spend the weekend taking more pictures.  I need to know how far this goes.” Rod said.

This caused me a moment of worry.  Not only was he starting to sound just a little more unhinged one of our employees getting arrested or going viral for walking around the city photographing people's hands was not what the company needed right now.

“Rod like I said… go home, get some rest.  If you want to look into this more okay but… be subtle about it.” I told him.

“Yeah I guess you’re right.  I… I need to think on this some more.  I’ll be back Monday morning okay?  Maybe after a good night’s sleep this will make sense.” Rod said and I thought I saw a tiny flicker of relief on his face.

Rob left.  I went back to working my section of the code, mostly front end and UI tweaks, Rob was really the genius as to the core of the AI model. 

About an hour before quitting time I happened to glance up and see Eric standing in the doorway to my office.

“Oh hey Eric, sorry I didn’t see you standing there.” I said.Eric smiled.  “Oh no worry.  Just swung by to ask, what were you and Rob talking about earlier, it seemed intense.” he asked.  His voice was non-committal but for some reason I detected a slight edge in the question.

“Oh nothing, just ironing out some last minute bugs with the AI model.”  I said. I gave a short laugh “Poor kid is still trying to work out the kinks in the hand modeling.”

Eric’s smile dropped.  Then it quickly returned, but the new smile felt very forced.  Then the weirdest thing happened.  Eric walked over to my desk and in a very weird, very deliberate motion reached down and using only his fingertips touched my desk with his fingers spread.

He’s intentionally showing me his hand and fingers, I thought with a slight shudder.

Eric spoke.  “Yes that’s quite a difficult problem I understand.  I hope Rob doesn’t blame himself if he can’t solve it.”  There was nothing specifically threatening in either his tone or his words, but there was something, something just under the surface that made me want to run away.

Eric slowly took his hand away from my desk, and then without another word, turned and walked out of my office.

I sat there for a few moments. I worked in tech long enough to shrug off weirdness from the techie types.  It comes with the territory and high end software development especially as a personality type begins at “delightfully quirky” and ends at “downright fucking weird.”  But still I’d worked with Eric for years and never came out of an interaction with him feeling this… creeped out.

I had enough for the day.  I made sure all my work was saved and backed up to the company file server, locked my workstation and head out.  On the way down the hallway I passed Doug from accounting.  He looked at me, gave me a smile that never touched his eyes, and slowly and deliberately, with his fingers spread wide, waved a cheerful goodbye to me and said “Enjoy your weekend!”

Janet from HR was in the front lobby, updating something on the big bulletin board.  When she saw me she smiled and started briskly tapping her fingernails, one by one, on the edge of the bulletin board as I walked by.

I drove home.  Tried not to think about it for the evening.  Tried really hard not to start at my hands and count the fingers.  I tried to watch TV but I kept getting distracted, keep counting the fingers on the actors and actress and newscasters.  I almost got watching into a Red Sox game but at one point the camera zoomed in on the pitcher’s hand while he had it behind his back before a pitch.  I turned it off after that.  They all had the correct number of fingers but I keep expecting to blink or see it out of the corner of my eye and see six.  I put on some music and drank a beer, then went to sleep.

I felt better in the morning and spent a normal Saturday and Sunday, mostly convinced that Rob had just had a minor breakdown from the stress of the project and his inability to fix what I was again thinking was just a long running and hard to pin down software glitch.  I decided I’d talk to him on Monday morning, pull him off the project for his own good if need be.

And that was it.  Until Monday morning.  I’m not at the office.  I’m at coffee shop a few blocks from my house.  About 6:30, about a half hour before I usually head out for work my phone started blowing up.  Rob was dead.  The morning news report filled me, or at least filled me in with what they knew.  On Saturday afternoon he had gotten into an altercation at a Target.  He was following people around, taking pictures of people’s hands.  Some father had taken him as a pervert trying to take pictures of his daughter and clocked him one and it escalated into a minor fight that someone had, of course, managed to catch on their cell phone camera.  Both Rob and the other guy were let off with a warning.  That wouldn’t even had made the news except that about 3, 3:30 on Monday morning a newspaper truck found Rob dead near his car, parked in the parking lot of our office.  He had used his badge to buzz into the building about midnight.  The login records showed he worked at his workstation for a couple of hours.  Then he had deleted a bunch of stuff from his profile and left.  Then someone had killed him.  The delivery driver found him next to his car.  His head had been bashed in good.  His laptop was smacked on the ground next to him.  The police are looking for the guy Rob got into the fight with on Saturday but I don’t think that’s the guy who killed him.

Because whoever killed him cut off his fingers and took the time to arrange them in 2 neat little rows off 5 right next to his body.

My phone is ringing constantly but I’m not answering it.  I’m sipping my coffee and counting fingers on people.  I’m wondering whether to go to the police and counting fingers on people. 

I’m counting fingers on people and I don’t know what else to do. 

I hope I figure it out before I finally count 6 fingers on someone’s hand.

This happened last week but for some reason it has been eating me inside and today I happened to see the folks I insulted again and I couldn’t see eye to eye with them. 
So this past Tuesday was my anniversary and I was already in a bad mood since I couldn’t get a leave to celebrate it with my wife due to a presentation I had to make. Still it was a happy day and I tried to be positive about it. Then my boss gave me grief over some trivial stuff which ruined my day and I was seriously frustrated and thought of putting in my papers, but I have a wife who’s just taken a break from work and a son who’s still in school and with the job market as is, I just wasn’t sure what to do. I didn’t know who to talk to and what to do. My mental state was bad. 
So after my stuff with my boss I decided to go downstairs with a coffee and just cool it off. This is in Hong Kong, so it was a pleasant day that day weather wise, not too cold, sun was out and I just wanted some time to myself. 
As I stood there in my thoughts a man and a woman, possibly a couple, walked up to me and the guy started speaking with me in Hindi. He was a local HKer, but spoke amazing Hindi. I was taken aback seeing a Chinese speak such good Hindi but I was still in my own zone so didn’t react to him. He started talking about trivial stuff, how my job is, what I do and which department, etc. I work in a bank so I don’t share any details, but my responses were very dismissive and rude(in hindsight). 
He then asks me if I ever really think there is A God, one true saviour and if I want to be free from all pain and suffering? I didn’t quite understand what he meant and it didn’t quite register with me given I was thinking about what I wanted to do with my job. So I just replied I am a Hindu and don’t wish to speak about my beliefs (don’t know why I felt the need to specify my religion). He then took out some leaflets and started showing me some literature when I saw JW.org and realized he was from Jehovahs Witness. I politely but firmly told him I am sorry I did not wish to talk about religion and God and I am thinking about something important. 
He then said he just needs a few minutes of my time to bring Jesus in my life and how I would be able to do better. Again it didn’t register with me as I was just blank at that stage. I again firmly but bit more forcefully said I am a Hindu and I believe in my God and to please not disturb me. 
He then started saying to give him my number so he can visit me later and talk because I need to hear Him. He took out his phone expecting me to share my number with him. I again said no thank you and I will not be sharing my number with him. 
He then began writing his number on the literature and tried handing it to me saying let’s talk later as Jesus will help me become happier or something to that effect. I was genuinely pissed at that point and in a moment of rage I said, I have told you I don’t wish for Jesus to help me, I don’t believe in Jesus, he is Not My saviour and you and your Jesus can GTH. 
Even as I type it I feel genuine hurt. I have never ever insulted someone else’s religion or religious beliefs. I have always taught my son the same, don’t insult someone’s religion or their faith and God, just like you wouldn’t want them to do to you. But I did exactly that. 
I saw this man’s wife flinch when I said what I said, a couple of people around heard it as well and the man looked shaken. He looked at me, said he’s sorry for troubling me and left, saying next time we can talk when you are in a better mood. 
I felt terrible. It’s been a week and I for some reason can’t get their faces out of my mind. I shouldn’t have said what I said about Jesus or their beliefs and I am sorry to any believers in Jesus, I was in a bad mental state and I reacted. 
Today I was downstairs in my office when I saw the couple and I put my head down to avoid them seeing me and rushed back up. I was ashamed. It’s like I committed a crime. 
I am a Proud Hindu, but not a fanatic. I love my religion and my God, but I respect every other religion and faith out there. 
So kind Redditters, AITA ? I am willing to see if I can meet them and apologise to them for insulting Jesus.

Thoughts on UST Pairings,"Hey everyone, I finally got my hands on the NothingProjector PET Crystal ALR motorized screen (100” version), figured I’d share how it’s been so far, especially since it’s pitched as a budget-friendly ALR option. Paid €1,399 on [sale](https://nothingprojector.com/products/132-inch-nothingprojector-black-series-seamless-lenticular-screen), which felt like a steal compared to those €2,000+ screens I’ve been eyeing. Setup was stupidly easy, just plugged it in, hit the remote, boom, it rises from the floor like some sci-fi gadget. Took maybe a minute to get going, no drilling or cursing at wall mounts required.  
  
Attached a pic of it in action in my living room, paired it with my UST projector (a cheap 4K laser one I snagged last year). The 95% ambient light rejection is no joke, I’ve got a big window nearby, ceiling lights on, the picture still pops with solid blacks and bright colors. Watched some 4K stuff last night, felt like I was cheating my old TV out of a job. The PET Crystal surface does this thing where it sharpens details without washing out, even from off-angles (my couch isn’t exactly centered).  
  
Only gripe is it takes up some floor space, about 2.2 meters wide for the 100” model, so my coffee table’s doing a little dance to fit. Still, for the price, I’m not mad. Curious what you all think, worth it over pricier ALR screens? Also, any killer UST projectors you’d pair with this? Mine’s decent but I’m tempted to upgrade.

Looking for some assistance and advice. As the title states, I'm moving from NYC to Louisville as my job is requiring me to relocate. It's a big change for me since I've lived in NYC my entire life, and I'm leaving behind friends and family. I'll mainly be on my own. The nature of my job will have my traveling around the Midwest and South a lot, but I'm looking for a decent apartment to rent in order to ground myself in between my travel jaunts. 

Some details about me: I'm 37, male, gay, and single. I add in the last two traits because they're relevant to me as I'm curious/concerned about dating, having access to lgbt communities, and of course, overall safety. NYC is obviously a big haven for gay folks. I'm looking for a two to three bedroom (mostly two bedroom) and my overall budget is up to $2,000, obviously, spending less would be ideal. Would like to be in a somewhat ""hip"" or more exciting area with amenities like gyms, nice restaurants, coffee shops/tea places, etc. nearby. My office which I'll have to go to semi-regularly between work trips is near, I think, Berrytown and Anchorage. 

I'm mostly a homebody, but I do feel like I'll have to be more active and outgoing in order to build some sort of friendships and relationships to try and keep loneliness at bay. 

Also, any general tips, information, or wisdom anyone would like to impart would really be appreciated. How is living in Louisville in general? South/Midwest life? I'll be traveling around to all sorts of areas in Midwest & South, but I've mainly lived in the northeast. So, anything I should be mindful about? Local customs and the like.

I stayed longer than I should have after a few betrayals because he's always supported me and held me up during literally a year of being unemployed after a major job loss (injured on job of 5 yrs) and is sweet and kind but once things got back decent(meaning both working and doing normal again) and we moved in together so much happened, so many fights and disagreements and no resolutions or even compromises. I was left unheard and misunderstood and if I brought anything up I was seen as fighting or having an attitude. I became exhausted, and eventually would just shut down to not cause bad moods in the apartment; as I was working at a trauma one hospital and everyday was draining already and his Finance job was also draining. Most recently these last four months he did attempt to redeem himself by finally going to therapy and finally being more consistent towards me and actually trying to compromise and find solutions. It's just not the same, I wish it was but I couldn't shake the feelings of possible future betrayals and lies and if I was respecting myself by staying. I'm sorry for the prattling I just need to vent, it's only been two days. Since it was amicable we did decide on a 30 day no contact and if we feel okay to grab a coffee or lunch and set boundaries for possible friendship. Is that good idea? Or should I not? I'm all over the place I'm dialing back into hobbies(I wasn't able to partake in as he lived in Lancaster and I moved in from Philadelphia, so now tons of fun city events to preoccupy me and new job has better schedule not as draining).

And reconnecting question,"I was best friends with my friend since middle school and we went through periods of being closer then a bit less. But in later high school we were really close and it felt reciprocal like we enjoyed one another’s company. But by first year of college things felt off. I tried to ask her to hangout and she was almost annoyed. I totally forgot this event but in middle school I once asked her to hang out after school twice and she said I’m obsessed with hanging out and she thinks it’s clingy. Later she re-initiated and actually did more planning than I did. 

 Back to college: out of routine I just asked what she’s up to etc. We stayed friends but there felt to be a rift. She didn’t tell me why. By second year I moved on to other friendships so we hung out but I wasn’t so concerned. Here she’d either not show up or push the time back: 30 min, 1 hour, etc. 


At one point I got a bit annoyed it felt super one sided and our hangouts felt tense. She also started to look more like me despite us spending less time together if that makes sense. I stopped reaching out. She didn’t even bother.


Years years later she’s engaged and we ran into one another, my mom knows her fiance. We met up for coffee and we said how we should do it again. Never did, she friended my Facebook and added my TikTok only for me to now check and she deleted those accounts and made new ones- doesn’t follow me there lol.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j2afyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1j2afyg/sahm_yet_struggling_w_pride/,SAHM yet Struggling w/ Pride,"My husband [30] and I [33] have been together for almost 4 years. For 3.5 years of that time, we were dating, although he is amazing and does everything for son (previous relationship) and I, I am having a very difficult time letting go of my pride. Let me explain,

We are recently married as of Nov 2024, but our relationship has been nothing but phenomenal. Everything I manifested in a man and a father figure, he possess. His attention to my needs, my struggles as well as my mental shortcomings, he’s been nothing but supportive and there when I needed him most. But although, we were boyfriend / girlfriend before marriage, I still kept my independence intact. So, I never asked for help or any money because for me, I didn’t feel entitled to it. After all, this was only a relationship. Everything he did for us financially, was completely by choice. And I’ve always been appreciative of such. 

Now that we are married, I am still struggling with not just this independence issue, but I’m practically “afraid” to ask for money. Whether it’s for gas, or something pertaining to my business, or even my personal bills like my phone. I don’t really have anything else. I have been a SAHM during the time we met, before working from home, but as of now, I have not worked in almost 2 years due to my health. I’ve been living with my parents, and now we have officially been on our own. 

I think about all the bills, and the fact that he is the “bread winner” of our home, that It makes me feel like I have no say-so or room to ask for any money that he makes. After all he does for me, what type of wife would ask for something as small as a coffee from Starbucks or anything I feel that is a luxury or something pertaining to my business that I’ve had to put on hold over the last year. 

He wants me to be a SAHM, and I too want the same. We homeschool our son, and it’s been a dream for me, but the financial burden on me of, “I should be putting forth something. And if not, I should be working to fulfill these needs for myself because he’s responsible for home priorities not anything else.” This has been MY WAY of thinking before he and I became a couple because of my sons father who used to use money against me, or not even so much help me pay a bill when he was staying with me. Anytime money was in conversation, I was afraid to ask him- which in return created me struggling as a single mother before my husband came along. I was very hardcore independent, and the thing is, I feel like I should be making my own money so that I can help out and be able to provide for my business myself. 

But I know we are “one” now and he will do anything for me but why am I so afraid to ask?! I literally was excited to be able to pick up my business again being that we are finally in our new home, only realize my bills just took a portion of the money I have left. On top of the side business I was doing for the last 4 years, is being put on hold which now I am no longer bringing in the income to take care of my bills. And now will either have to say something or take a chance and get my phone cut off without his knowledge along with other small bills like a credit bill that’s almost paid off.

I’m sorry this was a lot to read but in summary:

Speed: I will definitely give this to the Javabreeze as it is faster at making coffees

Steam: This is where the Luxe is better at, I've noticed it is so much faster to make lattes with it which for me is the highest earning drinks
Profits: As stated in the photos the first is with the Luxe360 at level 5 on a normal day, On average I usually earn 160-190 with it wherein the JavaBreeze also at level 5 only earns me 120-130 on average.

Which would I prefer?
