Move over gold bars and private jets—Richie Rich is diving into the digital world of crypto, and he’s doing it with style. That’s right, everyone’s favorite blond billionaire boy has discovered the magic of Bitcoin, and now he’s obsessed with one thing: **Bitcoin QR codes**. But not just any QR codes—**he's using** [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) to make his Bitcoin life way easier (and way cooler).

So how did the richest kid in the world end up deep in the crypto game? Well, let’s rewind the story a bit…

# The Bitcoin Lightbulb Moment 💡

It all started when Richie’s loyal butler, Cadbury, brought him a newspaper featuring a story on a mysterious digital currency called Bitcoin. Richie read how people were buying pizza with Bitcoin back in 2010 and how now that pizza would be worth millions. His jaw dropped.

“What? I could’ve bought Domino’s and the moon with that pizza money?” he exclaimed.

That was it—Richie Rich, the kid who once owned a robot dog that walks itself, was all-in on Bitcoin. But being Richie, he wasn’t about to just *buy and HODL* like everyone else. No, no. Richie wanted to integrate Bitcoin into his high-tech, cashless empire.

# Enter [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](http://BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com) 🧠💸

As Richie began building his own digital treasure vault, he ran into a problem. Sharing Bitcoin addresses was a total drag.

“What am I supposed to do—email a 42-character string of gobbledygook every time someone wants to pay me?” Richie huffed. “Gross.”

That’s when his tech-savvy friend Gloria introduced him to [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

“Richie, duh! Just turn your wallet address into a QR code,” she said, flipping her iPad toward him. “This site lets you create payment buttons, receive links, and super clean QR codes in like… five seconds.”

Richie’s eyes sparkled. “Are you telling me I can have *customizable* Bitcoin QR codes?”

“Yup,” Gloria grinned. “With optional amounts, labels, and even styles. So your QR code can be rich *and* good-looking. Just like you.”

# Richie Rich Goes QR Crazy 📱💥

Now Richie couldn’t be stopped. He was turning **everything** into a QR code.

* His lemonade stand? Now accepts Bitcoin via a laminated QR code taped to the table.
* His mansion’s vending machine? Scans for sats.
* Even his pet Dalmatian, Dollar, has a QR tag on his collar for donations to “The Bone Fund.”

Cadbury began scanning QR codes around the estate like it was an Easter egg hunt. “Master Richie, the espresso machine just asked me to tip it in Bitcoin.”

“Exactly,” Richie smirked. “It’s the future, Cadbury.”

# Hosting Billionaire Crypto Parties 🎉🚀

Next thing you know, Richie threw a party. But not just any party—a **Crypto Gala** featuring DJ Satoshi, NFT art, and... QR code everything.

At the entrance, guests were greeted with a sign that read:  
**“Welcome! Scan here to pay the 0.001 BTC cover charge (comes with a solid gold churro).”**

The QR codes, of course, were all created using [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). Each QR led to a slick payment link with Richie’s custom branding and preset amounts. Even his tip jars had QR codes with “Thanks for the sats, you legend!” messages built in.

# A Business Empire Powered by Bitcoin

Richie didn’t stop at parties. With QR codes in hand, he launched an entire line of micro-businesses:

* **“R-Bucks”**: His own coffee brand that only accepts Bitcoin via QR codes.
* **“The Satoshi Arcade”**: A private arcade where every game cabinet has a QR scanner and charges 0.0001 BTC per play.
* **“MoonMart”**: A pop-up store in space (okay, technically just a drone floating above Beverly Hills) that sells freeze-dried snacks… payable with a QR scan, of course.

And for his online empire? Richie added **Bitcoin payment buttons** to all his digital stores using the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker payment button builder**. With just a few clicks, he could generate links and buttons that embedded perfectly into his sites. His fans could now tip him, buy merch, and even donate to his charitable foundation (which teaches underprivileged kids about sound money and Lamborghinis).

# Why Richie Loves [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](http://BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com)

We caught up with Richie for a quick interview between yacht parties and mining rig inspections. Here’s what he had to say:

When asked what he’d say to other kids or adults looking to get into Bitcoin, he added:

# Final Thoughts: Don’t Be Poor, Use QR

Okay, Richie didn’t actually say that last line, but we felt it.

Here’s the real takeaway: Whether you’re a mega-rich comic book character or just someone trying to make Bitcoin easier to use in everyday life, [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) is your secret weapon.

* Want to accept Bitcoin without typing out a long address? ✅
* Need a quick, scannable link with a fixed price? ✅
* Want to embed a payment button on your site or blog? ✅
* Like Richie Rich and want to feel cool for using crypto? ✅✅✅

So, go full Richie mode. Slap a QR code on your lunchbox, your side hustle, your grandma’s knitting website—whatever. The future is now, and it’s full of squares. Glorious, money-making QR squares.

Richie wouldn’t have it any other way. 🤑📲

1jvcmgs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jvcmgs,Turned a Parisian corner restaurant kit into an Irish pub (with Guinness!),"Found this kit on amazon and decided to personalize it. I haven’t seen many reviews of the kit (Cute Room Corner Restaurant on Amazon) so I figured I’d pop photos of the completed mini, the process, and the packaging, etc here. 

My advice going into this kit would be to buy fast drying glue (kit comes with none) and have paint on hand (the paint in my kit was dry). Also buy electrical tape. The kit asks you to glue electrical to hold it into place which just isn’t feasible. You’ll need electrical glue to attach the light fixtures to the roof of each floor. 

Other than that it was a lovely kit! I loved making the tiny wine bottles, lamps, martini glasses, and plates. Nothing was damaged or missing in the kit and the pieces weren’t so delicate that I broke them during assembly. 

Everything I personalised was:
-I cut out Irish “wallpaper” for some of the walls and an Irish name (An t-Óglách was an old Irish newspaper, it means The Volunteer) from a book called “Me Jewel and Darlin’ Dublin.” 
I also cut out a circle crest from the book with an Irish harp and the phrase “Freedom through Difficulty” and added it to the bottom floor.  I made tiny newspapers using clippings from the book as well. 
-I used an old earring as a painting for the upstairs floor. 
-I added a tiny “Kennedy’s Irish Coffee” poster upstairs by cutting up an old coaster. 
-I made the tiny Guinness with micro black tubing and felt. 
-I painted the postbox green and black so that it would look like the postboxes in Ireland. 

Overall delighted with how it turned out. The only mishap was a chewed up couch that had to be remade (2nd to last pic). The last pic is of the very guilty culprit. ",1,1744222385.0,miniatures,0,1.0,False

Me (20F) and my BF (24M). In the early months of our relationship, he was really sweet and just genuinely helpful throughout the day with housework. We used to cook together, clean together, etc. It felt like we were a real team.

But over the past few months, things have shifted significantly. He started being really disrespectful. At first, it was just some jokes during the day like, ""I won’t clean the dishes – it's your job,"" and we started splitting activities a little differently. I did the kitchen, and he handled the general house cleaning, made the bed, and so on. I was okay with that. We both work 8-hour days, split all the payments 50/50, and we agreed that the same fairness should apply to home responsibilities.

However, I wasn’t sure what happened, but by the end of February, I started to feel unsure about his loyalty because of his behavior. He became really distant and disrespectful when I tried to text him during the day. He stopped cleaning, and I was left doing everything on my own – even making his morning coffee, something he used to do for himself because he wakes up just before me.

Then, in March, I began to feel almost certain that something was off. He would reply to my texts with just 1-2 word responses, didn’t do anything around the house, and spent most of his time locked in his ""computer"" room. Once, when I asked him to clean the dishes because I had a headache, he immediately said, ""That’s not masculine; that’s how you lose respect as a man."" I was confused and honestly, frustrated.

I didn’t know what was going on, so I did something I’m not proud of. I unlocked his phone while he was asleep, thinking I’d find messages from other girls or something that would explain his behavior. But what I found was even worse… His social media was completely filled with Andrew Tate content. I wasn’t familiar with him before, but after confronting my boyfriend about it, he admitted that he watches Andrew Tate for 1-2 hours a day. He told me he considers him an ""inspiration"" and even a ""mentor."" I didn’t know how to feel about it.

The situation has only gotten worse since then. He’s been sending me daily reels and TikToks of Andrew Tate, and after discovering his ""interest"" in him, I decided to watch the same videos. I have to say, I think he’s understanding things wrong, or at least interpreting them in a way that doesn’t sit well with me. I get that Andrew Tate’s lifestyle is different – he pays for everything himself, his partner doesn’t work, and so on – but we have agreed that we split everything: dinners, holidays, trips, home payments, etc. Yet now, my boyfriend seems furious about cleaning and helping out at home.

I’ve gotten to a point where I’m really tired of this behavior. He seems to be picking and choosing which parts of Andrew Tate’s advice he wants to believe, but not following it through in a way that actually matches the lifestyle he’s endorsing. I feel like it’s affecting our relationship, and I don’t know if the damage is reversible.

So, AITAH for ""banning"" him from watching Andrew Tate? He seems to stop watching it when he’s around me, but I’m unsure if the influence has already taken hold.",2,1744222335.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Any way, the story....

So, when I was around the age 18 to about 22, I lived in this small village in Ohio called Yellow Springs. I was homeless off and on and had to couch surf/be a live in house keeper and do odd jobs to make money, it was rough times but I still kept a positive outlook. Well around 18, I met this girl who I'ma call sussy baka for reasons that will be clear later on (i'll shorten it to sussy). She was a singer, a fire spinner, an artist, and i was honestly SO drawn to her and wanted to be her friend because I was starting my life over and wanted more fun and authentic people around me to support me on my path of healing. 
Around this time, I had just gotten out of an abusive situation with my ex fiance and cut off some toxic family members, so I was very (what I call) dangerously naive and trusting and it wouldnt really regester to me immediately if people werent *obviously* abusive, making me an easy target for narcissists and occultic vampires. 
So sussy and I developed a friendship over the years and I trusted her, (cause why wouldnt I? I met her in *Yellow Springs* where all the hippy women live hApPiLy In HaRmOnY and dont screw each other over....) and almost immediately started to see red flags, but i didnt want to ""judge"" her because I felt like maybe she just needed a good friend. These red flags started out as just things like her getting upset and yelling outside my boyfriend(at the time)'s apartment because I didnt remember we'd made plans to hang out and I didnt want to hang out bc i was crying and had just had a fight with said BF (everywhere in that village is a 5-10 min walk so its not like she drove or took a boot to get to me) 
Then, other odd behaviors started to present themselves the more shit i forgave. She HUMILIATED me on stage during one of my poems in front of an ex boyfriend n his new gf, a crush, and others while wearing the dress i gave her bc ""it looked better on her"" which added a deeper element of symbolism to that betrayal. She n her boyfriend would ask me if i ""even knew what * insert a word * meant any time I would speak with wordplay or talk about anarchy/oligarchy/state of the world shit or talk about psychology"" which would make me start to second guess myself and my intelligence bc the mental state i was in during this time wasnt the best, so i was under the assumption that everyone was smarter than me...
I was always trying to uplift her and show her that she was a good person, and she would act like my friend in private. She particularly loved to pick at me in front of men, and would always make it a point to tell me that i looked like a child (i am very short and at the time was struggling really bad with my E.D.) n even said my butt was shrinking. When other women would walk by, she would get CREEPILY upset and said once, verbatim ""man.....😒....i hate * so and such * so much...shes so pretty and talented. I dont even know why her bf loves her, i would treat him so much better"" n then be super nice to said woman to her face. She would make shit up about people and tell only people who she knew might believe her, as soon as somebody was no longer a commodity to her. 
Well then, i started to see even more......started to notice right after i cut my hair off, she did too. I started going topless and started a topless community, which she later tried to take credit for starting and someone caught her in a lie, and started to share poetry at open mic instead of singing like usual, made advances to ANY man that would so much as look at me (and would sleep with some after i did), started modeling and taking the same types of glamour shots, similar style to MY pictures, and started telling people MY jokes that I wrote. 
Normally people taking inspiration doesnt bother me, i'm a unique person with a unique spin on styles so I am somewhat used to people being inspired by my visions and uniqueness and i want to inspire people. However, this was different.....it was like she wanted to...be me. This bothered me for a few reasons, 1 being like......you're so pretty and talented, tf? Just be yourself... 2, okay, littttle creepy ngl and 3, I have a more spiritual way of looking at things, i wont detail it too much but its not a compliment to be envied...
So this really started to upset me and I wanted revenge, but not in the way girls who get betrayed by their best friends usually go about it, and i wanted proof she was copying me. I sure as shit didnt want her stupid boyfriend, and she had nothing I wanted and i wasnt going to risk looking like *I* was the bully first. So I came up a plan........ operation, reinvent style and become a southern bell. 🤠😎 
So for a couple weeks,  I studied southern accents and how to make it sound really subtle so I can first appear like its always been there, but its more faint, hidden, and ""only noticable"" when I speak louder. I practiced and perfected it and eventually tested it on strangers in public who would ask where I'm from and say they liked me accent... It was time. 
I walked out into the village, makeup on fleek n barefoot and nicotined, and walked right up to sussy baka. I struck up a conversation with her in my shiny new southern accent, smiling with my eyes closed up at the sun, looking sexy and carefree. And she had the usual, obviously masking, micro expression that showed her annoyance at my confidence and charm, one eye focused more than the other (almost side eyeing) and the very forced smile and slightly raised single eyebrow, with a tense disposition. I had arrived. 
I walked away with my hips a'swayin in the dang ol wind while saying ""seea later hunny, have a good rest yur day🤠"" 
Later on, probably a couple weeks later, I came in to the coffee shop where all the locals hung out. I ordered my coffee and went outside for a cigarette. Sussy is off in a corner talking to an older guy, probably about giving her money, n i happen to tap in to the conversation for a minute and what you mother lovin believe it...........she was talking in a very obvious throat drawl. I literally started laughing so hard, it got the attention of the old man she was talking to and she purposely did not look at me when he turned to look at me. I then ashed my cigarette and went on my way, laughing menacingly to myself. 
So as the summer was moving by, i was just living life and enjoying it while it lasted, being around better people and keeping my interactions with sussy to a minimum. When I *would* be around her, I would make sure to talk in that Southern accent. THEN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤠It got to a point where she started to try to compete with me.........over who was more southern. Not having any clue that *I'm* not southern, and that i know she isnt either. But i still entertained it bc i'm a sociopath🥰💅🎀 so she'd be like ""yeAh, * insert my name * yuh really shud come ouwt to mah pappy's faRm some tahm n leaRn how tuh tAn a hAud"" 
N i'd be like ""I maght hAvetuh thAnk abowtd it, thAnx fuh the iAnvAught🤠"" 
Its been years now, I'm 25 and in school......and i still catch myself speaking like this from time to time. N she still has no clue that I know we are both not southern. ",1,1744222270.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Despite repeated firings and little technical ability, they’ve landed a staff engineer title, a book deal, and a co-founder role, all without being able to code. This was because she became the sugar baby to a guy in leadership at a big company. And I don’t say that they can’t code lightly, they genuinely don’t know how to code. In between jobs they tried open source for 1 week, their code was a complete mess, I’m talking they couldn’t even make simple changes to CSS code and can’t run a basic project with npm. So they wrote a script to fake green contribution squares instead. Their method for circumventing live coding interviews was by claiming to master a very niche tech stack where seniority is assumed. Then, once they got in, they focused on glue work, fetching coffee, and corporate social gaming. 

They’ve even recommended I do the same: fabricate senior experience to get past the filters. It’s hard not to feel disillusioned when I’ve stayed honest, worked hard, and still find myself underemployed and relying on food banks.

I know how to “sell” myself, but I’ve always hoped competence and integrity would be enough. This situation has me questioning whether that’s still true, especially in this market. I’m actively looking for my next software engineering role, and trying to reconcile how to move forward in a market that seems increasingly indifferent to merit.

I don’t want to lie, but I’m not confident I can land a job on merit alone given my situation. I have a CS degree pending final credit review, and 5 years of experience—3 in developer advocacy (essentially a junior engineer role with community and documentation work), and 2 as a junior software engineer. 

I’m currently underemployed at a low-paying European social impact company. The market no longer hires developer advocates without prior senior engineering experience, and most software roles now require senior-level backgrounds too. So regardless of the path, I need to become a senior engineer—but that’s not possible in my current role.

After 6 months of interviews, every rejection has been for not already being senior, yet I’m overqualified for junior roles. My local economy is also struggling—I can’t even get hired in retail or food service. The only local option is clearance-based military tech, which I’m ethically opposed to and might not qualify for.


Literally feel like the world is forcing me to lie. Just to be able to eat and have healthcare. I don’t want to. Lying about a whole other job where I reached a senior level goes beyond normal embellishments and risks burning bridges with my current network. But if it’s the only way what other choice do I have?

I wonder what having a coffee in Cuba will feel like ? Someday, I wish to see the science laboratories in Europe., the biggest telescope out there are on my list, someone is on a road trip across Australia, while someone is dreaming of a better life in China,

I also wonder how do the tribes living  off  the coasts of New Zealand live on their islands.

Do you wonder if our beliefs related to anything might just be a fallacy? Like a competition at who has the max headcount for that particular thought.

Imagine someone out there in the universe, crying, or shouting to the void , only to be scared of their own silence. 

The mind wanders, i guess.

Ursula Lindberg, new employee of the Federnet Research Agency, Earth, Human-Arxur Republic, New Terran Calendar 31-Anubis-36 (Old Human Calendar: 27th of September 2048)

A flighty cold breeze caresses my face while I walk. It's early morning, and the roads are only starting to fill with pedestrians and commuters on their way to work. I am slightly excited, after a never-ending battery of tests, interviews, and security evaluations, today I finally start working at the Federnet.

After a quiet 15 minutes walk I arrive, the building is a utilitarian glass cube on the outskirts of the city, facing the mountains. I enter the lobby and show security my new work ID. After a quick check, I’m escorted upstairs and told to wait in a corridor facing a gray door.

While I wait, I notice quite the collection of memes and pictures taped to the wall. From an old-timey *Keep Calm and Hack the Federation*, to a smuggled Exterminators poster with ""*Beware of Predator Lies, Trust the Herd*"" printed on it, to my personal favorite: a picture of a fortune wheel labeled ""*Federation Cybersecurity Be Like*"", with wedges reading ""*Insert Password: ProtectTheHerd123*"", ""*Thinks 'Firewall' Is Literal*"", and ""*When in Doubt, Panic*"". On the bottom of this last one someone had scrawled with a black marker *how the heck we still have a job?*

While I am still chuckling, I hear from behind:“Miss Ursula Lindberg?”

I quickly turn around and from one of the doors has emerged a short asian woman with a simple but elegant black suit.  

“Yes, it’s me. Good morning.”

“Morning, I’m Nguyễn Mai Lan but you can just call me Lan. I am your new team leader”

We shake hands, and she welcomes me into her tiny office. On one side, a huge window frames a beautiful mountain view; on the other, a desk holds a computer and an old family photo, slightly burned on the edges, while a massive Matrix poster dominates the wall. She sits behind the desk and gestures to me to sit on one of the chairs in front of the desk. 

“So, I assume they gave you a general overview of what we do here…” \[I nod\] “As for what you are going to do, well at the beginning mostly information collection: monitoring social media, mapping connections, identifying vulnerabilities, opinions, and compiling profiles. If you work well, we’ll pass you to a more active role disseminating rumors or gossip, creating conspiracy theories and more in general dissent. Do you have any questions or doubts?”

I shake my head. “Very well then, a colleague will arrive to show you around and get you started.” She barely manages to finish the sentence when we hear a soft knock. 

“Come in Alkimos”

*Alkimos?! Could he be…* the door opens and the familiar face of a Jaslip pops in. 

“Hi Ursula”

“Hi Alkimos, I didn't expect… Why didn’t you tell me anything? ”

“That’s our fault I am afraid, due to the fact that he isn’t a citizen he can’t tell anyone external or he will lose his visa” interjects Lan, “Well, I will leave you with him. Nice meeting you Ursula”

“It was a pleasure for me as well”

\[time skip a few minutes\]

After a series of intricate corridors, he opens a grey door. Inside, there are three desks, behind one sits a guy that is more or less my age, that is vibing at some music in his headphones while typing. He raises his head and says:

“Hi, I’m Diego. You must be the new girl Alkimos won’t shut up about.”

“Ehi, that’s not true!” says Alkimos while waving his tails awkwardly.

\[Giggling\] “I’m Ursula, nice to meet you.”

“You guys from the uni are swarming here, this place is getting posh. That said, if you’re as good as him, we might as well pack our bags.”

“You exaggerate”

“Says the guy that last week caused a minor diplomatic incident between the Cradle and Nishtal.”

He then gestures me to come closer and, on the screen, displays a video of what looks like a deepfaked video of a Krakotal general saying “Puah the Gojid, whenever they are in danger all they seem able to do this days is roll up, pray, burn everything down while retreating and then blame us”.  He looks at Alkimos and says “It went viral before they removed it everywhere and it caused a minor diplomatic spat.” And then to me “Don’t be fooled by false modesty, he is pretty damn good.”

“Mah, I wouldn't even work here if they didn't desperately need more people who understand social media, since you guys kinda don’t.”

“I mean if you mean social media with our identities on instead of nicks you are right those died with the Fall more or less” says Diego “But we have plenty of forums and chats”.

“Right. I remember that our parents had something similar to fed platforms, the blue birdie one and the other one, how was it called Fakebook or something?”

“Wait, if you had them, why are they gone?”, says Alkimos.

“After what happened, all those photos and last messages were too much for a lot of people…I went to visit the Memorial Museum in Budapest, there is a room where they project those photos and messages all around and…it’s a lot” I say somberly.

“That I can understand” he says with a pained face, me and Diego exchange a look and he goes “Why don’t you help the newbie in setting up the stuff? It’s getting late.” I take the hint and “Yeah we should really start” I say with a smile.

In the next couple of hours, he helps me to set up profiles on sites like Soft Paws or My Herd and we work together on my first cases. It’s actually quite the patient and attentive teacher, it’s quite nice working with him.  Once he deems me ready, he lets me compile profiles independently, checking in only occasionally.

After my last check, he glances at me: “We’ve been at this a while. Fancy a break?”,

“Yeah, sure. I could use a coffee”

“Diego, are you coming with us?”

“Can’t, too much to do. Have fun guys”

“Before we go, did you bring your own mug? They removed all the paper ones because someone kept stealing them.”

“Nope”

“She can use mine.” Says Diego and hands me a black cup.

We walk two doors down and enter a room with the usual collection of memes and pictures, including this framed ticket: *“Arxur ate my USB drive. Recovery possible?”.* I start giggling while we walk toward an automatic coffee machine on which somebody had taped an image of Sonic with a cup of coffee and the message *coffee because murder is wrong*.

After he grabs a cup of tea and I get a cappuccino, we sit on one of the round tables scattered around the room and start chatting. After a while he looks at me a bit hesitant and goes: “You are from Iceland right?”

“Sort of. My family has been living there for many years. Why?”

“I have a cousin, Admi. We all thought she had died when Esquo got attacked. Turns out she is alive and well. She is on Earth, in a refugee camp in Iceland” he says happily.

“Really which one?”

“One in the south, near Vík”

“Ah yes. I know the place. Are you going to visit her? Can I help you in some way?”

“I am going next weekend, but I don’t really know anything about the place and I would like to bring her something nice. She arrived with nothing. Can you help me find something one of these days?”

“Absolutely! And I would do more, I’ll ask my dad to give you a ride to Vík. The place isn’t exactly near the spaceport and you’ll have to do a crazy detour on public transport.”

“Are you sure? I don’t want to bother…”

“Don’t worry. It’s nothing, besides, he had lived through similar things. I’m sure he’ll be glad to help.”

“Thank you very much.”

“It’s nothing really. When do you want to go shopping? I am free tomorrow afternoon if you’d like.”

“That’s great!”

As I finish sipping my coffee, I stop to think that this job might be really alright.

Welcome to the world of *Bruce Almighty*, where an ordinary guy from Buffalo, New York, gets a shot at being God—or at least tasting what it’s like! Your Benefactor (perhaps Morgan Freeman in a crisp white suit) grants you 1000 Choice Points (CP) and the chance to spend 10 years in this funny yet surprisingly deep universe. Here, you can work miracles, wrestle with the consequences of your whims, or just try not to mess everything up. Will you be the new Almighty, a skeptic, or a mere bystander? The choice is yours!

---

General Setting

The story unfolds in Buffalo, New York, in the early 2000s—a typical American city filled with everyday folks, local news, and mundane struggles. But everything shifts when Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck reporter, is handed divine powers by God Himself, tired of Bruce’s complaints. The world remains realistic, spiced with supernatural flair: miracles happen, prayers get answered (sometimes too literally), and chaos ensues if details are overlooked.

This is a place where humor meets morality—Bruce learns that power isn’t just fun, it’s responsibility. You’ll step into this tale, where you can aid Bruce, take his role, or watch it all unfold from the sidelines.

---

Rules of the Jump

- You’ll spend 10 years, starting when Bruce gains his powers (2003).
- Your abilities and items carry over post-jump, unless they conflict with the next world’s rules.
- Divine powers here have limits: you can’t directly override free will or destroy the universe—God (or your Benefactor) keeps things balanced.
- You can alter the plot (teach Bruce a different lesson, change Grace’s fate, or meddle in his career), but some events may be “protected” by a higher power.

---

Origins

Choose your role in this world. Each origin provides discounts on specific perks and items.

1. Almighty (400 CP)  
You’re a person gifted with divine powers, like Bruce. You can perform miracles, reshape reality, and hear prayers, but with great power comes chaos and accountability. You start in Buffalo, perhaps after a visit from God in an odd spot (like a warehouse).  
*Discount*: On perks and items tied to divine power and creativity.

2. Beloved 
You’re a close companion to the Almighty, like Grace Connelly. You live a normal life but are tied to someone wielding divine might, forcing you to deal with its fallout. You start in Buffalo with a job, a home, and faith in better days.  
*Discount*: On perks and items linked to emotional strength and support.

3. Skeptic 
You’re a cynical observer, akin to Evan Baxter or Bruce’s coworkers. You doubt miracles and believe everything has a logical explanation. You start at the TV station or an office, with a career and healthy skepticism.  
*Discount*: On perks and items related to logic and professionalism.

4. Drop-In 
You arrive in Buffalo with no past or connections, a random witness to divine events. You’ve no set role but total freedom to explore. You start on the street or in a café, with a blank slate.  
*Discount*: On perks and items tied to adaptability and independence.

---

Perks

Perks are grouped by origin, but you can buy any at full price. Discounts halve the cost for your origin.

General Perks

- Sense of Humor (100 CP, free for all)  
Your ability to laugh at yourself and find humor in any situation makes you the life of the party. Even in chaos, you keep it light and upbeat.

- Random Miracle (200 CP)  
Sometimes your wishes come true in unexpected ways. Want coffee? It appears. Need rain? The sky clouds over. These are small miracles, but they add some fun.

- Voice of the People (400 CP)  
You hear “prayers”—the thoughts and desires of those around you. It’s not telepathy, just an intuitive grasp of their needs. You can help or ignore them, but the noise in your head is unavoidable.

Almighty Perks

- Divine Gesture (100 CP, free for Almighty)  
You can alter reality with a flick of your hand: move clouds, turn on lights, or make a dog talk. Small miracles are your playground.

- Chaos Creator (200 CP, discounted)  
You excel at staging grand (and hilarious) events: the moon draws closer, stars spell words, cars fly. Consequences? That’s someone else’s problem.

- Prayer Control (400 CP, discounted)  
You can filter millions of prayers, hearing only what you want and responding with precision. “Yes” or “no” is your call, and chaos becomes manageable.

- Divine Charisma (600 CP, discounted)  
Your presence inspires awe. People see something greater in you, trusting and believing your words. You’re a god in mortal eyes, even without miracles.

Beloved Perks

- Unshakable Faith (100 CP, free for Beloved)  
Your belief in goodness and love never breaks, even when the world crumbles. You inspire others by example.

- Power of Forgiveness (400 CP, discounted)  
You can forgive any mistake and help others improve. Your patience and kindness transform people for the better.

- Anchor of Reality (600 CP, discounted)  
You’re a rock for those lost in divine power. Your presence grounds them, reminding them what truly matters.

Skeptic Perks

- Sharp Mind (100 CP, free for Skeptic)  
Your rational outlook finds logic where others see miracles. You quickly uncover explanations and solutions.

- Professional Success (200 CP, discounted)  
You thrive in your career—journalism, business, or otherwise. Colleagues respect you, and bosses value you.

- Skeptical Filter (400 CP, discounted)  
You’re shielded from divine influence: prayers don’t reach you, and miracles don’t sway you. You stay true to yourself, no matter what.

- Master of Competition (600 CP, discounted)  
You can outshine anyone—even the Almighty—in their own game. Your plans and ambition make you a serious rival.

Drop-In Perks

- Accidental Witness (100 CP, free for Drop-In)  
You often find yourself near key events, from Bruce’s miracles to his flops. It’s your chance to step in or just enjoy the show.

- Independent Spirit (200 CP, discounted)  
You’re unbound by this world’s fate. Freedom of choice is your strength, and no one dictates your path.

- Luck in Chaos (400 CP, discounted)  
When everything falls apart (and it often does), you come out unscathed. Random miracles or others’ mistakes work in your favor.

- Shadow of God (600 CP, discounted)  
You wield divine power indirectly: not creating miracles yourself, but guiding them through others. You’re an unseen puppet master.

---

Up to 8 companions, if you’ve got the CP.

- Canonical Companion (100 CP per one, 300 CP for up to 4)  
Bruce, Grace, Evan, or even God (in human form). They keep their traits and join you.

Create your own: a new Almighty, friend, or skeptic. They get an origin and 600 CP.

Drawbacks

Take up to +600 CP to spice things up.

- Eternal Whiner (+100 CP)  
You complain constantly, like early Bruce. It grates on everyone.

- Random Prayers (+100 CP)  
You accidentally answer stray prayers, sparking minor chaos.

- Divine Wrath (+200 CP)  
God (or a proxy) is peeved and sends petty trials: rain, breakdowns, bad luck.

- Love Crisis (+200 CP)  
Your relationships crumble due to divine power—or its lack. Expect drama.

- Prayer Overload (+300 CP)  
All city prayers hit you at once. The mental noise is unbearable.

- Skeptic on Your Tail (+300 CP)  
Evan or another cynic hunts your secrets to expose you.

---

End of the Jump

After 10 years, choose:

1. Stay: Live in Buffalo, with or without divine power.
2. Go Home: Take your gifts back to your world.
3. Move On: Head to the next jump with new abilities.

She told me that she no longer had feelings (since 2 months), because she felt like she was more of a caregiver than my girlfriend (in the past 4 months I had a hard time quitting a course and looking for another job. I also looked for another car but I was always indecisive about everything, which caused discussions and annoyances to flare up). I respected her choice, even though I found it difficult, and we parted on good terms. The last of our belongings were divided at the end of the month. We actually texted and called each other the entire month of March, we also kept in touch via social media and sent each other snapchats. In this she saved every selfie in the chat that I sent to her. We always had good contact via app about the relationship and how it went etc. In this she did say that I should continue with my life and not wait for her.  She did say that she ""might regret her choice one day"" and that she doesn't see it working to get back together in the short term. She did want to remain friends, and hoped to have a cup of tea/coffee together again one day. Now we haven't had any contact since April 1st, at my request, and she removed me from Instagram and Facebook. I only removed her from Snapchat 3 days later. After that we ""really"" had no more app contact. Now I wonder if I still have a chance to win her back? I hope that this period of no contact helps, and that she wants me back. Because she did say contradictory things, and because she wanted to remain friends and meet up again later. Do still have a chance to win her back?

# 2025's Best Cuisinart Replacement? Top Food Processors Reviewed & Compared!

Is your trusty Cuisinart sputtering, struggling, or simply not performing like it used to? You’re not alone! Cuisinart is a beloved brand for many home cooks, small buisness owners, and even appliance repair technicians. But even the best appliances eventually need repairs or, sometimes, outright replacement. Whether you're searching for Cuisinart replacement parts, considering an upgrade, or just want to explore the current market, this guide is for you. We’ll dive deep into alternative food processors that offer similar or even superior performance, features, and reliability.

This article will provide actionable insights to help you navigate the world of food processors. If you're after a cuisinart replacement bowl, Cuisinart replacement blade, or even a whole new machine, we've got you covered. Finding the right appliance parts or understanding whether it's time for a new food processor entirely can be a daunting task. We aim to simplify this process,providing you with the data you need to make an informed decision.[[Explore Top Rated replacement for cuisinart on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=replacement for cuisinart)
## Why Consider a Cuisinart Replacement?

Before we jump into alternative models, let's explore some common reasons why you might be seeking a Cuisinart replacement.

*   **Wear and Tear:**  Like any kitchen appliance, Cuisinart food processors experience wear and tear over time. Blades become dull,bowls crack,and motors can weaken. Regularly using your food processor for demanding tasks like chopping nuts, kneading dough, or processing frozen ingredients can accelerate this process.
*   **Availability of Cuisinart parts:**  While Cuisinart does offer a range of cuisinart spare parts, finding the exact part you need for your specific model can sometimes be challenging, especially for older machines. You might find yourself searching extensively for a genuine Cuisinart part that's compatible with your unit.
*   **Cost of Repairs:** Depending on the issue, the cost of cuisinart repair, especially if it requires hiring an cuisinart authorized repair technician, might be comparable to the price of a new food processor.
*   **Technological Advancements:** Food processor technology has advanced significantly in recent years. New models offer improved features like more powerful motors, wider feed tubes, pre-programmed settings, and more convenient cleaning options.*   **Capacity Needs:** Your cooking habits and needs may have changed sence you initially purchased your Cuisinart.Perhaps you're now cooking for a larger family or tackling more ambitious recipes. A larger capacity food processor might be a better fit.
*   **Desire for Upgrades:** Maybe there isn't anything wrong with your food processor, but you have heard good things about newer models. Upgrading to a more advanced processor can give you increased functionality.

## Understanding Your Cuisinart: Model Number Lookup and Identifying the Needed Cuisinart Parts

Before replacing your entire unit, it's crucial to investigate whether you can salvage your existing Cuisinart food processor.  A good first step is identifying the Cuisinart model number lookup. This is typically located on the base of the machine, near the power cord, or on the original packaging. Once you've identified the model number, you can begin your search for cuisinart replacement parts.

Common Cuisinart Parts that Require Replacement:

*   **Cuisinart Replacement Blade:**  Dull blades are a common issue. Replacing the blade can significantly improve the performance of your food processor, especially for tasks like chopping, slicing, and shredding.
*   **Cuisinart Replacement Bowl:** Cracks and breaks in the bowl are another frequent problem.  Make sure to get a bowl specifically designed for your model.
*   **Cuisinart Replacement Lid:**  Lids can also crack or become damaged, affecting the machine's ability to operate safely and efficiently.
*   **Motor Components:** For issues with the motor, internal components can sometimes be replaced, but this is frequently enough a job best left to professionals.
*   **Drive Shaft:** The drive shaft, which connects the motor to the blades, can also wear down over time.
*   **rubber Feet:** While seemingly minor, worn rubber feet can cause the food processor to vibrate excessively and perhaps damage your countertops.

Where to buy cuisinart Parts:

*   **Official Cuisinart Parts Website:**  The Cuisinart website is the most reliable source for genuine cuisinart parts. This ensures compatibility and quality.
*   **Cuisinart Parts Online Retailers:** Sites like Amazon often have a wide selection of cuisinart replacement parts from various sellers. Be sure to check reviews and verify the part's compatibility with your model.

Before buying, compare prices from diffrent retailers and always confirm that the part is compatible with your specific Cuisinart model.[[Explore Top Rated replacement for cuisinart on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=replacement for cuisinart)
## When is it Time for a Replacement?

While replacing individual parts can extend the lifespan of your Cuisinart,there are situations where a full replacement is the more practical option. Consider these factors:

*   **Motor Failure:**  If the motor is wholly dead or making unusual noises even after replacing other parts, it's likely time for a new machine. Replacing a motor can be expensive and complex.
*   **Extensive Damage:** If the housing of the food processor is cracked or severely damaged, the appliance may no longer be safe to use.
*   **Cost of Multiple Repairs:** if you find yourself needing to replace multiple parts within a short period,the cumulative cost can quickly exceed the price of a new food processor.
*   **Obsolete Model:** If your Cuisinart is an older model, finding replacement parts might become increasingly arduous and expensive.

From the taker of copious \*Stupid little walks for my stupid mental health\*, I bring you this silly little post for my silly mental health. Available right now, on a phone in front of your face.







I’ve done a fair bit of thinking over the past months, and I realised I’ve mostly been living life on autopilot. Get up, work late, cook, eat, read or game, and repeat. When family or coworkers ask me what I’ve been up to, I don't really have anything to share.  I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.







I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!







You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again.







I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.

Thinking out loud here with questions at the bottom. In my endoscopy they found inflammation in my stomach and was obviously irritated. They also dilated my esophagus a bit. Waiting on rest of results, should have by Friday. 

Went to the ER almost a month ago because I didn’t eat for almost a straight two weeks (couldn’t hold anything down) and threw my blood tests all out of wack. Thought I had kidney and liver issues maybe. Started 40mg a day of omeprazole and that slowly got me back into eating, blood tests showed everything normalizing once I started eating again. Still has not got me to where I want to be. Still can’t eat a big meal (sub 600 cals) or anything on the acidic side. And struggle to get to 3k cals which was a piece of cake before.

Just wild something simple as acid reflux could cause all this. You couple this with anxiety and it’s a shit show in your head lol.

Found today I can handle matcha better than coffee (hopefully not speaking too soon). 

But I am a little concerned about having a couple drinks every blue moon at social events, figuring out what I can have at a restaurant, and getting my calorie count back up.

I couldn’t get a picture since I was driving but I saw a medium sized (50-60lb) tan colored dog on the road. I think it did have a collar. I saw it around 11:05 AM heading towards Castle Rock. It looked pretty scared and went off to the right of the road after I passed. I’m not sure exactly where but it was before the Dinosaur place. I think it might’ve been the mini golf course. Hope someone finds them! Sorry I couldn’t be of more help. 

I added a picture of the area I think I saw the dog in :)",3,1744220575.0,ColoradoSprings,0,0.8,False
1jvbuuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1jvbuuw/just_need_to_vent_if_thats_okay/,Just need to vent if that's okay...,"My mom is an Alcoholic, she has been an alcoholic for 20-21 years.    
She has always made my life hell, to the point of driving me to drink and becoming an alcoholic myself. I am 4 years sober, and after 4 years of sobriety, her actions just want me to drink. I won't, but my god I wish I could have wine again, but I usually just relax with the faux stuff, or maybe kombucha.  

She has destroyed EVERYTHING. All throughout my life, she has ruined couches, TV's, coffee tables, fridge doors, broken glasses and plates, and then some.  Last major thing she destroyed, was another TV. This has been our 2nd TV destroyed by her in a while, but 1 is too many, let alone 2. She stabbed it 8 different times. Yes, that's right, S-T-A-B-B-E-D. Stabbed.  All because of her and my father disagreeing over a stupid Facebook thing. I called the police on her that morning, but they didn't do anything, as per usual.

She doesn't even correlate that alcohol is the reason for why she blows up to the degree she does. She's even stated, in regards to her drinking, "" I am not gonna stop what I like doing. "" regardless of how many times my father has argued with her, begging her to stop.  Like many addicts, she's been through many things that added up over time, and she found drinking as a cope, and as an addict in recovery myself, I can really feel for her on that end. She's hurting, but that doesn't excuse her behavior with hurting others. I can understand both sides, but I feel that when I go to any  victims of addicts, they tell me I'm just another terrible addict who doesn't understand the pain addicts put other people through. I do. I live it daily, I always have. I made the choice to get sober, and better my life in that aspect, but I just want the same for her. Is that so terrible?

I have the option to get a restraining order, but I know for a fact my entire family will hate my guts. All hell will break loose. So what's better? Tolerating it and just wishing on a star? Or having my entire family hate my guts?  My sister won't get the restraining order either, despite her pressuring me to do so, and my dad admitted that he's not strong enough to do it. So where does that leave me? The only person with the sole responsibility of being the bad guy? How is that fair to me?   
  
I can't leave, so please do not suggest that. I get so exhausted by people who tell me to ""just leave."" Jesus, I thought about that, but I literally can't unless I go live on the streets, which isn't any where near safer than here. I'm afraid to leave my father, as the stress from her actions have led him to have a mini-stroke, and to have heart problems. I'm scared that the more arguments they have, and the more she takes her rage out onto others, it'll happen. I want to force her into rehab so bad, but am constantly told it ""won't work"" but what else is there? I'm forced to tolerate her behavior, until I can get some more luck. I've been looking for a job for almost a year now. I had one, but got let go, and finding another one has been hell.   
  
I just want someone to tell me I'm not an asshole, pos, or a loser as my mother makes me feel like on a daily basis when she gets hammered, and projects her emotions and insecurities onto me. It's all she ever does.  I just need to get this off my chest, with people who may also understand.  Please, don't judge my situation harshly if you've managed to get out, and live a better life for yourself. While I'm happy for you, that doesn't mean everyone has the same chances.

1jvbtjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1jvbtjo/how_much_caffeine_is_in_instant_coffee_uncover/,How Much Caffeine is in Instant Coffee: Uncover the Surprising Facts,"**Instant coffee is convenient and quick. But how much caffeine does it have?**

Instant coffee usually contains less caffeine than regular brewed coffee. For many, coffee is an essential part of the day. It provides a much-needed energy boost. Understanding the caffeine content in instant coffee can help manage your daily intake. Different brands and types of instant coffee vary in caffeine levels.

Some might have more caffeine, while others less. Knowing the exact amount helps you make informed choices. Whether you’re cutting down on caffeine or just curious, [learning about instant coffee’s caffeine content is beneficial](https://gomehedi.com/best-instant-coffee/). This blog will explore the caffeine levels in instant coffee and what you need to know.

# Caffeine Basics

Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in various foods and drinks. Understanding its basics can help you make informed choices about your caffeine intake. This is especially important if you enjoy instant coffee, which is a convenient and popular way to consume caffeine. But how much caffeine does it actually contain? Let’s delve into the basics of caffeine to find out.

# What Is Caffeine?

Caffeine is a natural chemical found in coffee beans, tea leaves, and cacao pods. It acts as a stimulant to the central nervous system, helping you feel more awake and alert. Here are some key points about caffeine:

* Chemical name: 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine
* Found in over 60 plant species
* Commonly used in beverages like coffee, tea, and energy drinks
* Average half-life in the body: 3-5 hours

Caffeine works by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. As a result, it helps to increase the levels of other neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. These chemicals improve mood, focus, and alertness.

While moderate caffeine intake is generally safe for most people, excessive consumption can lead to side effects such as:

* Insomnia
* Jitters
* Increased heart rate
* Stomach upset

It’s important to monitor your caffeine intake to avoid these potential side effects. Knowing how much caffeine is in your favorite drinks, like instant coffee, can help you manage your consumption better.

# Sources Of Caffeine

Caffeine can be found in a variety of foods and drinks. Here are some common sources:

|Source|Average Caffeine Content|
|:-|:-|
|Instant Coffee (1 cup)|30-90 mg|
|Brewed Coffee (1 cup)|70-140 mg|
|Tea (1 cup)|20-60 mg|
|Energy Drinks (1 can)|80-200 mg|
|Dark Chocolate (1 oz)|12 mg|

Instant coffee is a popular and convenient way to get your caffeine fix. Its caffeine content can vary depending on the brand and preparation method. On average, a cup of instant coffee contains between 30 to 90 mg of caffeine.

Other sources of caffeine include:

* Soda
* Over-the-counter medications
* Some dietary supplements

Tea is another common source, with black tea containing more caffeine than green or white tea. Energy drinks are also popular, but their high caffeine content means they should be consumed in moderation.

Understanding the sources of caffeine can help you manage your intake. This knowledge is especially useful if you enjoy multiple caffeinated products throughout the day.

# Instant Coffee Overview

Instant coffee is a popular choice for many coffee lovers due to its convenience and ease of preparation. But how much caffeine does it contain? To understand this, let’s take a closer look at what instant coffee is and how it is made.

# What Is Instant Coffee?

Instant coffee, also known as soluble coffee, is a type of coffee that is made from brewed coffee beans. It is processed into a dry form that can be quickly rehydrated with hot water. This makes it a convenient option for those who are short on time but still want to enjoy a cup of coffee.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Feeling Stupid and Scared.,"My STBXW and I filed for Divorce within 4 days of her being back from her military training. She said she was unhappy, we didn’t align anymore (goals, aspirations), she wanted to focus on her career and enjoyed being alone. It was all a lie. 

The next day when she was at work, I took the week off to spoil her with love, affection, and to reconnect. I found her love notes, practiced signature, date ideas, and stupid questionnaires they did together. All on accident. 

January 23rd. She met J. She told me I’d love this guy in her class. We loved the same soccer team. We had the same sense of humor. Hell I’ve seen pictures and the only difference is he’s older and has different color eyes. The 21st of February she told me she wanted a divorce. We flip flopped between divorce and working on the marriage. 

She told me I was emotionally unavailable, some truth to that. I wasn’t as outgoing as she needed, she used to be introverted and never wanted to go out of her comfort zone. I didn’t support her (Supported her through undergrad and her Masters degree, and helped her join the Army). I got my ass to therapy and am continuing. 

Within a month of mentioning the D-word we filed. I tried, I begged, I offered marital counseling. To distance myself from family she didn’t exactly like. To do more, to continue my therapy, give her space. Once I realized she wasn’t budging I let go, painfully. It was all lies. She was, key word was, the sweetest and most gentle person ever. For her to have flipped so fast was scary. Mid-January we were planning a nursery and baby names to try this summer. To she couldn’t stand my touch or presence. 

After I found out I confronted her by just saying “I know”. We had a multi-hour heart-to-heart. Lots of tears, lots of information. A lot of sex, the best I’ve ever had. Her emotional affair I thought was something I could work through. I wanted to save my marriage and rescue that sweet innocent girl I married. 2 days after D-Day she tells me she feels guilty for hurting me and me still being the perfect and sweet soul after her affair. That she processed a separation and wants to follow through. I moved out by that Friday. She threw away 5 years and 2.5 years of marriage away for a guy who is about to move to Germany while I’m right here.

I’m just at such a loss. I gave and gave everything within my body and soul. I trusted and loved her blindly and unconditionally. I hate that I’d take her back if she apologized and asked. I hate that I don’t have that self-respect. I hate that she hasn’t called me for help, or to say she’s sorry and she made mistakes and she’s wrong.

I know my journey just started and I have a new chance to grow. I’m 28, but damn does it scare the shit out of me to think I have to restart and potentially find someone new one day. Trust me I am not ready for dating outside of meeting new people for coffee. 

All the older guys at work have gone through similar things and all say she’ll regret it. Why can’t she regret it now? Why didn’t she regret it when I was taking care of our dogs and the house? Why doesn’t she regret it now and call?I don’t think she’ll ever regret it. 

I want to know the why. I want an answer. Why wasn’t I good enough? Handsome enough? Smart enough? It’s so demoralizing to give someone everything and to just get a shit sandwich.",9,1744220368.0,survivinginfidelity,10,0.91,False
1jvbr2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1jvbr2z/is_javy_protein_coffee_worth_it/,Is Javy protein coffee worth it?,"I've noticed a lot of hype around **Javy Protein Coffee** lately, and as someone who's constantly trying to balance convenience, nutrition, and a tight budget, I was intrigued enough to give it a shot. Over the past month, I've made Javy my go-to morning drink, and I wanted to share my honest, balanced thoughts—especially for anyone else who might be on the fence after reading other **Javy coffee reviews**.

**First Impression & Why I Tried Javy Coffee**

I'll admit right away: I’m not the kind of person who usually goes for instant or protein-infused coffee. But after seeing so many positive **Javy protein coffee reviews** online, my curiosity got the best of me. My mornings had become a cycle of expensive lattes, followed by sugar crashes and regret. The idea of swapping out my usual routine for something healthier, easier, and more budget-friendly was tempting enough to give it a try.

I ordered the Mocha flavor through their official page ([**you can see it here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)), and once it arrived, I got right into it.

**Taste and Consistency—Better Than Expected**

Let's talk about taste, because that's honestly what I was most skeptical about. Usually, protein coffee products taste artificial or gritty. Surprisingly, **Javy coffee protein** had none of that weird texture. It dissolved completely, blending into my almond milk without leaving those nasty clumps or grainy bits at the bottom of the glass. The mocha taste was enjoyable, closer to a mild iced coffee than a sugary mocha latte. It wasn’t identical to my usual coffee-shop order, but I honestly didn’t mind the switch.

**Energy Levels & Hunger Cravings**

After using it daily, the biggest difference I noticed was how stable my energy levels were. Typically, by mid-morning, I'd crash hard and reach for snacks—usually sugary stuff. With **Javy coffee**, the protein seemed to slow down the caffeine absorption, smoothing out the energy burst. Instead of jitters and crashes, I had consistent energy all the way to lunchtime. I also experienced fewer cravings throughout the day, which was a nice bonus I didn't really expect.

**Health & Gut Benefits**

One thing that caught my eye on the packaging was the addition of prebiotics and the MCTs listed among the **Javy coffee ingredients**. I didn’t think much about it at first, but after a few weeks, my digestion noticeably improved. Less bloating and overall smoother digestion definitely made me feel better, which I attribute partially to switching from sugary coffee drinks to something cleaner and protein-rich.

I even checked out their quick quiz ([**quiz page here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?uid=34951&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)), which helped me confirm I'd chosen the right option for my lifestyle.

**Is the Cost Justified?**

Price was my other big consideration. At around $30 per bag (less if you buy more), Javy seemed pricey upfront. But breaking it down per serving made me realize it's only about $1.50 a cup. Given I used to spend roughly $5 daily at coffee shops, this switch saved me a good chunk of change over the month. Plus, making it at home each morning was incredibly convenient.

**Any Downsides?**

For the sake of balance, I have to mention that real coffee purists might find it lacks the depth of freshly brewed espresso. It’s instant coffee, after all. Also, anyone highly sensitive to lactose should be cautious—it contains about 1g per serving. Not a huge issue for me, but worth noting.

**Final Verdict—Worth Trying?**

So, is **Javy Protein Coffee** worth it? I'd say yes, especially if you're someone looking for an easy, affordable way to upgrade your morning coffee routine and add more protein. It's not revolutionary, but after 30 days, I found it definitely improved my mornings enough to stick with it.

Have you tried **Javy coffee**? I'm curious to hear what others think!",1,1744220312.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

One, the old Tortorice's spot, is going to be a candy store. (@allaboardcandy on insta though it sounds like they might go with a different name for the store.) Looks like they do very tiktok-friendly gummy candy boards and stuff but they'll have pick-and-mix and all sorts of stuff. Guessing it'll be pricey, but fun. Don't know their timeline but paper only went up in the windows within the past week or so and it was still visibly untouched inside until then.

Across the street in the former Ultimo spot, paper's been on the windows for a little bit now but today I noticed they've painted ""coffee, conserva, aperitivo"" on the exterior wall so still a coffee shop, but sounds possibly like a Herman's kind of concept? 

Anyone happen to know anything more about either spot?

The familiar face of Kendu will forever be etched into the attendees minds and we can gain a lot of holders through this event.

10-15k people will be attending this event over the 2 days which is crazy, Kendu will be handing Kendu Energy out, making a mural and we will have a tent.

Massive shoutout to StaySeaArt and the Kendu street team for their amazing efforts. This will be the 3rd Florida Festival in 6 months!!!

This is another addition to Kendu’s game changing IRL success.

**Why IRL alpha is important**

IRL alpha is important because it cannot be faked. Whilst memes, tweets, reddit posts( not this one) and whatever else can be faked. IRL products and events cannot be. Crypto isn’t the most trusted space in the world so the fact we have IRL content is massively important for retail investors.

As AI use increases globally, IRL alpha will be the most crucial for investors by far

**What has Kendu achieved/got:**

18k holders

50k certik votes, only other coin to ever achieve this is Pepe.

283 million ATH market cap

Extremely active telegram and social media scores

**IRL events/products**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Some Thoughts**

Kendu is around 10 million market cap, with social media dominance that is nearly unparalleled, with telegram activity that is off the charts. In addition, Kendu also has IRL alpha that has never ever been seen before. Kendu is going to the billions and I believe we will set the memecoin standard for the future. There is no doubt in my mind that we will see ""How ..... is the Kendu of 2029"", people will see Kendu as a benchmark and they will try and match us.

My advice to you is to join the Kendu telegram and just hang around, you don't have to buy Kendu, but I think you will see how different Kendu is to the rest of the competition. Any questions are always welcome, just ask in the telegram or our subreddit [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/).

This is strictly my opinion and is not financial advice but I think Kendu can 1000-3000x this cycle. Yes maybe I am deluded but I truly believe that we are at the foot of one of the best financial opportunities available this decade.

If Shib can do a 1000x in 36 days(from 22 million to 22 billion), with less money and less understanding of the potential of a strong memecoin, I think Kendu can match this.  
Kendu is organic and has an incredible community just like Shib, Doge and Pepe, these 3 have proven that community is the deciding factor in a memecoin and that is all that matters.

Kendu belongs in the memecoin hall of fame with them 3 and we will get there, there is no doubt in my mind. Kendu belongs in the billions and the community deserves it for sure.

She's larger than the Corsair but weaker than the Cutlass? CIG could fix this over a cup of coffee, couldn't they?","The MSR's current NAV speed is 1,200 m/s. What if we just tweak that number to 1,450 m/s? That wouldn't break balance, would it? NAV speeds don't even matter for combat anyway - they just save us commuting time.

Her SCM speed is 215 m/s, only 15 more than the Taurus. Could you mercifully boost it to 600 m/s? Who exactly is this ""blockade runner"" supposed to outrun? A Reclaimer's blockade?

Her turbo boost acceleration is sluggish too. Give her Razor-level straight-line acceleration! Let her hit max speed in 5 seconds - isn't that what a ""STAR RUNNER"" deserves?

If these are too much to ask, and CIG insists the MSR exists to be target practice (absurd ""protect the MSR"" missions included), why not make her quantum travel exceptional? She's got those massive exposed engines - just retcon them as ""specialized Size 4 quantum engines"" and let her match Polaris speeds! Couldn't you update these numbers in five minutes between coffee sips?

Then why not?

The Syulen, half the MSR's size, has better firepower (3×S3 guns solo-operated vs MSR requiring three crew) - why?  
The Spirit, half the MSR's mass, has double the HP (67,000 vs 37,000) - why?  
The $60-cheaper Taurus carries more cargo and firepower (172 vs 114 SCU, 4×S5 vs 2×S3) - why?  
The 400i without ""STAR RUNNER"" prestige outruns the MSR - why?  
The 20% larger Starlancer MAX has better maneuverability (31/31/65 vs 30/30/60) - why?  

The MSR is larger than the Corsair but weaker than the Cutlass Black. Dear CIG, look me in the eyes and tell me WHY???

Weren't you obsessed with the MSR before?  
Didn't you make endless ISC episodes gushing about her?  
Wasn't this your childhood Star Wars/Millennium Falcon fantasy?  
Why treat her like a forgotten stepchild after sales?

In a game struggling to create non-combat content, how hard is it to let a cargo ship simply outrun danger?",25,1744219756.0,starcitizen,13,0.78,False

They are good friends as well, although I spend more time with them one-on-one than together. 

C comes from a place where dental care is not common. His teeth are visibly messed up-sure they stick out at strange angles, but it’s more unusual than off-putting, and doesn’t bother me. What does bother me is the SMELL. Sometimes it’s not perceptible at all, but other times you can smell it from up to 7 feet away, even if I know he’s brushed his teeth that day. It smells a bit like pond water, but -overwhelmingly- like dead animal. If we’re in the car together, the window has to be open in order to breathe; if we’re at coffee I typically look down, and when he speaks I cover my drink. We still spend time together because it hasn’t been too bad until it escalated recently. 

He’s very sensitive about the issue and worries people talk about it behind his back. As he has no insurance or extra money, I’ve gently suggested a new program in our area that fixes teeth if he feels insecure about it and is open to try, and even mentioned a time I dealt with similar health issues (I am severely immunocompromised and got an infection after mouth surgery, successfully treated). He was grateful for the info, but has made no effort to pursue it. 

C constantly complains he’s getting older now and still can’t get girls. He’s otherwise attractive, intelligent, very funny, has a cool very stable job, and lots of talent/knowledge/passion in his interests. He is charismatic with friends and otherwise an absolute joy to be around, and I have no idea how to tell him this is almost certainly the sole issue.

Flash to the other day- we had game night at our house, which we do often, and I made cocktails. He put his half-finished glass near the bookshelf, where I couldn’t find it for two days until I was doing a weekly deep cleaning and went looking for it. I was horrified to find a FULL glass with a diversity of mold and bacterial cultures (4+ individual), that had somehow managed to form in an alcohol glass in less than 2 days. My roommate J (who knows about our friend’s issue) saw it and is banning him from the house, and would like for my immune safety that neither of us hang out with C until the problem is fixed. He's right- in the past few months I have started seeing more signs of perio illness in myself and am worried I’ll have to go through treatment again, which was extremely rough on my body because of my illness. 

C has also expressed romantic interest in me in the past, to myself and our friends, which although he seems to have dropped, I'm not completely sure. I shut this down long ago and made it very clear we will not be partnered ever in the future. Still, I also want to be clear to him again that even if he fixed his teeth, our friendship will stay as-is. I am his closest friend, and am still wondering whether I should even be the one to mention this again, or if he needs to know other people have a problem with it.

None of my previous recommendations that he get help for this have been taken seriously, how can I tell him if he doesn’t fix this issue, we won’t see each other again?

Age: 26

Occupation: formerly a research assistant, currently unemployed.

Hometown: Baltimore metro area

PTO: I accrued 1.25 days a month, and had 14 days paid out when I left my job

I was at my job, an entry-level research assistant position in an academic lab from fall 2020 (my first post-graduation job) to mid-March, and last year it really began sucking the life out of me. As I was applying to grad school last fall, I decided that regardless if I got in anywhere or not, I needed to quit. I was SO burnt out - the commute was miserable and I wasn't paid enough to make moving out from my parents a real option, I felt underappreciated, and promotions were out of the question with funding being so up in the air (unfortunately our lab was already having issues prior to the new admin). Additionally, my boss is a good scientific mentor but a poor manager, and I was sick of dreading our 1:1s. But on the flip side, I really, truly, loved the research I was doing, had great relationships with coworkers, and the general vibes had improved a lot from their lowest point, so I was really torn up about leaving. I knew I'd panic and try to push off quitting, and so I booked this trip last fall to hold myself to the day I decided to leave.

**Section Two: assets + debt**

Retirement: \~$22,700, split 60/40 between a 403(b) and Roth IRA.  
Savings: \~$22k in a HYSA, with $10k set aside as my emergency fund. I also keep $2500 in a non-HYSA that's with the same bank as my checking for easy transfer.

Checking: \~$3k

Investments: $7,500 in a brokerage account

Income: Currently none, but made $16.25-$17.50 an hour (after COL increases) for 3.5 years, and was making $19.23 an hour beginning last summer after pushing for a raise when I quit my job.

Debt: None

**Section three: travel expenses**

Before the trip:

Hotel: $1,169.61 for 4 nights at a SoHo hotel, with $923.04 worth of miles applied to it, so $246.57

Train: $58 round-trip from Baltimore to NY Penn

Insoles: $59.95 - I got new shoes about 2 weeks before this trip that I didn't have time to break in, but my current ones were falling apart so I needed to take the new ones. I bought an extra pair of these insoles in case the new shoes hurt my feet (foreshadowing!) but they didn't end up fitting in my shoes lol - however I did buy them for this trip so I'm counting it

 **Day 1**

6:30 AM: Alarm goes off after 4 (four) hours of sleep - I had a hard time falling asleep because I was so anxious about missing my train. I realize as I'm checking my Fitbit sleep data on my phone that I fucked up scheduling my Lyft (accidentally scheduled for 7 PM 🫠) but luckily am able to book a new one and a driver's close by (which isn't always the case around here!). Phew.

7:00 AM: Throw a Kodiak muffin cup in the microwave and eat it, then order Starbucks to pick up on the way to the station. I add $25 to my card and get a lavender oat milk latte and a Danish. For convoluted reasons, my parents are paying me back for my Lyft, so I'm not including it, but it was about $50 with tip. ($25)

11:15 AM: Get to the station with plenty of time to spare. I spend the train ride alternating between trying to work on playlists and organizing files on my phone and trying to sleep. I manage to doze off a little, which I can almost NEVER do while traveling, and it gives me a much-needed boost.

11:20 AM: Get to NYC and go to use the bathroom in Moynihan only to discover one is closed so every person in this station has convened at the same open one. I run into Walgreen's while waiting for the line to get shorter and buy a pack of tissues ($1.08), and try to get an OMNY card but apparently they only restock the OMNY cards in that store like once every other month, which seems like a big oversight in Penn station? Eventually get through the nightmare bathroom line and get my card in the subway. ($35)

12:15 PM: After several wrong turns I finally drop off luggage at hotel, hop back on the Subway and start my afternoon at Goods for the Sturdy. NGL, pretty disappointed in their selection - a few nice paper brands but overall a lot of really generic notebooks without a lot of options. The pen section is better, and I buy a 0.5 mm Zebra Sarasa pen in forest green. ($3.21)

12:30 PM: Get lunch at La Pecora Bianca! I keep it simple with a pomodoro spaghetti which is really good and also get a spiced cranberry-orange mocktail that's incredible. I accidentally order the Fancy bottled still water and worry that the restaurant probably thinks I'm the type of tourist who won't drink tap water (I almost exclusively drink tap water!) but I do drink a lot of it so it's not a total waste of $8. ($51.54)

1:15 PM: More SoHo time! First stop is Housing Works, which has a lot fewer books and worse clothing selection than I remember (but it's been like 9 years so who knows). Don't end up getting anything here, but briefly consider a $3 bc it's much colder and windier than I expected. I decide to go to Uniqlo instead and duck into the MoMA design store to look at stuff (and warm up) on the way.

1:45 PM: Get lost in the Uniqlo but emerge safely with a hat and some socks 🫡. ($22.80)

2:00 PM: Time for McNally Jackson. I'm immediately obsessed, it's SUCH a good bookstore. I buy a birthday gift for the friend I'm meeting tonight, and then 3 for myself - The Beauty of Games by Frank Lantz, Brief Interviews with Hideous Men by David Foster Wallace, and When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamín Labatut. I've only read the Labatut before so I'm excited for the new ones. (Side note - this made me even more confused about how much space Goods for the Sturdy is taking up because the selection isn't much better than in here?). I could've spent another 2 hours here. ($79.40)

3:15 PM: Make my last two shopping stops. I go to Neuhaus Chocolates and get myself a 12 piece box ($38.72) and also a free sample (!) and then swing by Muji on the way to the hotel and buy a ton of pen refills ($9.80). As I leave I decide I'll need to go back later and get more refills because it would be dumb to deal with shipping anytime soon when there's one a block from my hotel.

3:45 PM: Absolutely wiped out, I head back to the hotel to check in, only to discover my room isn't ready yet. They're very nice about it and I chill in the lobby before finally getting upstairs and immediately collapsing in bed for an hour (didn't actually sleep, but the rest helped) before getting myself ready for dinner. My feet were starting to really hurt by the end of shopping, so I put on boots in the hope they'll be more comfortable.

5:30 PM: Meet a college friend for happy hour at Añejo, and get two margaritas, two carnitas tacos, and we split a salsa sampler and churros. All extremely good, and it's so good to catch up with her. ($66.16)

7:15 PM: We're having such a good time that we decide to go to a lesbian bar in the West Village! I'm the only one with cash so I pay for drinks + tip. ($20)

9:45 PM: After saying goodbye at the subway, we go our separate ways and I head back to my room - I'm happy with the day but my whole body huts and I am already exhausted for tomorrow lol.

**(Total: $352.71)**

 

**Day 2** 

9:15 AM: I wake up for the 3rd time from noise in the street but decide this time I need to get up and get my day started. Throw clothes on and get a cherry blossom latte from the coffee shop in the hotel lobby. Pretty good, the ruby chocolate in it is a nice touch. ($8.44)

10:20 AM: Walk over to the bus stop and pass the Ghostbusters firehouse which is a fun little surprise. I'm heading out of my way because my sister is obsessed with this one bagel place in Chelsea and said if it wasn't good I could Venmo her and she'd pay me back lol. I get an onion bagel with scallion cream cheese and even though I'm not sure it was worth a 15 minute deviation I decide it's good enough and big enough that I'll eat the cost. ($7.46)

11:00 AM: Whitney Museum time! One of my favorite museums but I haven't been here in ages - love the changes they've made to their permanent collection but am pretty ""meh"" about their current temporary exhibit. Realize I'm missing an Amy Sherman exhibit by like 3 days and am bummed, but still have a nice time despite my feet really starting to hurt - I thought I stood at my job enough this wouldn't be an issue! ($30)

2:00 PM: Start to feel really crappy and shaky and can't tell if my blood sugar is low or I'm just tired (or both). See on Google maps that the Starbucks Reserve Roastery is close by, which I've seen pictures of before and always thought looked cool (can confirm, it looks cool inside). I head out from the museum. I get an iced coffee and chocolate tart ($22.91), then text my brother and let him know that I can come visit earlier than planned.

3:45 PM: Schlep uptown to see family! Hang out at my older brother and SIL's apartment for a few hours, watch a few March Madness games (St. Johns absolutely decimating my brackets) and play with my niece. We get ramen for dinner, my brother pays. Have a really lovely time with them.

7:15 PM: Head back to the subway. I forgot to pack toothpaste, and the small tube the hotel gave me has SLS in it, which really irritates my lips. I walk past a store that looks pretty crunchy and successfully find a tube of SLS-free toothpaste. I spend awhile looking at the desserts and snacks they have, but my stomach is feeling a little unsettled, so I stick to the toothpaste ($7.49).

8:00 PM: Make my way back to lower Manhattan, my stomach feeling worse and worse. I have no idea what in the ramen (or the chocolate tart from earlier in the day?) could have upset it, but it keeps me up much later than I'd hoped to be awake and I'm dreading tomorrow.

**(Total: $76.30)**

 

**Day 3**

8:45 AM: Wake up, feel a little better but still not great. My brunch reservation is at the hotel's attached restaurant, Mostrador, so I decide to go and if I feel crappy after can go lay down.

9:30 AM: Brunch. Get French toast and bacon and it's... fine. I'm a little whelmed but also don't have much of an appetite, so that definitely didn't make it more appealing. Because the restaurant is attached to the hotel, I'm able to use hotel credit on it - but to use the credit I can't pay now, I have to pay at check out? At least that's what I gather from the waitress; it's explained very poorly to me. I head back upstairs to change into my boots (hoping they'll be more comfortable than my new shoes) and end up lying in bed waiting for my stomach to settle again.

10:30 AM: After laying down for a bit I decide to push through and head for the subway. Unfortunately the train is super crowded and hot, and I start to feel really nauseous. I am NOT going to be that person who throws up on the subway, so I get off at DeKalb, a few stops early, and immediately feel better once out in the cold air. My special exhibit timeslot isn't until 1:15, so I decide to take my time letting my stomach settle.

11:30 AM: Take a walk around a shopping center by the station and realize that the Brooklyn McNally Jackson is here! I'd been planning on going to a different Brooklyn bookstore that my brother recommended after the museum, but I decide just to hang out here for a while and nix going to that one, figuring I'll probably be exhausted by then anyways. I get The Employees by Olga Ravn and Antwerp by Roberto Bolaño. ($32.61)

1:15 PM: Make it to the Brooklyn Museum in time to make my reservation for the gold exhibit, which is pretty cool - would probably be better appreciated by someone more into fashion, but it's really fun and I'm glad I spent the extra money to see it. ($25) I spend the next few hours going through the museum's permanent collection and am honestly… pretty whelmed by their collection but especially by the curatorial choices they made. I have a protein bar I brought with me, but end up going to the museum café and getting a croissant anyways. ($7.62)

4:00 PM: Surprise - even with boots and compression socks, my feet are super sore again, and I'm still in kind of a bad mood, so I decide to call it a day. I get a postcard with a cool vintage illustration of the museum on it and head out. ($2.72)

5:30 PM: I get back to the hotel and am planning on getting dinner from Mostrador again, since I'm exhausted and it's right there, and come dangerously close to crashing out when I see it's closed and that they only do dinner Wednesday-Saturday (what?!). I go back to my room, drop my stuff off, then order some Italian and go pick it up. ($37.65)

7:00 PM: Eat my spaghetti and tiramisu in bed, watch Monster Factory for like 4 hours, then sleep.

**(Total: $105.60)**

 

**Day 4**

9:30 AM: Take the subway one stop away and get breakfast at Balthazar! Get an almond croissant, a Nutella tartine, and a soft-boiled egg in an attempt to get some protein into my diet (I fail because the tartine is much bigger than I thought it would be and only end up eating half the egg lol), a latte, and they bring me a free glass of champagne since I'm a solo diner. My pastry and bread is spectacular and my waitress is really amazing. I know it gets the reputation of being a little touristy but I have a lovely time. ($37.35)

10:15 AM: However..... my stomach is miserable again (champagne and coffee on a mostly-empty stomach? Shocker!) and I decide to walk around a bit and window shop before heading up to MoMA. When the rain starts to come down hard again, I go into Glossier, which is one of the weirder retail experiences I've ever had (very pretty but bizarrely designed store), and I get a tube of lavender balm dot com because I've finished 3 chapsticks in the last month. ($17.42)

11:30 AM: Get to MoMA, which is an absolute madhouse because of the rain, and buy my ticket ($22). Start at the top floor, where a Jack Whitten retrospective just opened. I only vaguely knew of Whitten because one of his paintings is at the BMA, but the exhibit absolutely blows me away, and is easily my favorite exhibit I saw in NYC.

12:30 PM: Feel dehydrated and a little crappy, so I stop by the espresso bar and get a water and an iced tea ($8.72). There are so many TEENS here - it seems like every middle/high school in Manhattan has a field trip today. Once I feel sufficiently rested, I head back up and start going through their permanent collection. I hadn't been back since before the renovations, and the changes they've made since then are great and I have a great time.

2:30 PM: Check the time to make sure I'm still on pace to spend enough time in the Museum of the Dog and get dinner and discover in one fell swoop that I fucked up the planning for both things. The sandwich place closes at 3 and the museum isn't open on Mondays, oops! It probably ends up being for the best that I can spend more time at MoMA, but I'm still bummed.

3:45 PM: I am sore, hungry, and realizing I forgot to bring a protein bar. I wrap it up and get a postcard from the gift shop, which I'm disappointed to realize doesn't have any of the Jack Whitten stuff in the ground floor shop, so I get a Seurat one instead. ($2.23)

4:30 PM: Make it through the pouring rain to the subway and then to Grand Central. With my plans for today completely messed up, I decide to get food at Grand Central and bring it back to my hotel but really quickly realize I'm so exhausted and hungry I just need to eat there. I go to the Luke's Lobster in the food hall and get a crab roll and a diet coke and absolutely inhale the sandwich. ($35.49)

5:15 PM: Do a little wandering around the station, including down the GCM to see the Kiki Smith mosaic down there, then go back and get ice cream at Van Leeuwen. ($10.74) Have a little ""romanticize your life"" moment eating ice cream in Grand Central and people-watching.

6:30 PM: Take the subway back downtown, and duck into Muji before returning to the hotel. I get a bunch more pen refills, some glasses wipes, and a pack of oil blotting sheets. ($10.23)

7:30 PM: Once again crash in bed early, watch like 8 episodes of Monster Factory, then sleep.

 **(Total: $144.18)**

 

Day 5

9:00 AM: Last day! I go and get breakfast at the Blue Bottle coffee in the lobby. I get another cherry blossom latte and some overnight oats and try to steel myself for the arduous journey ahead of me (lugging my bags with me to Penn station + a two stops on the way). ($12.79)

10:15 AM: Check out - I knew there were facility fees to pay at checkout but my total (even ignoring the added brunch cost) is much higher than I expected, so it sours me a little more on the hotel, which has been pretty mid. ($188.07)

10:30 AM: Make my way to the subway a few blocks away with all my stuff, then get off at 14th Street to pick 8 gluten free everything bagels from Modern Bread & Bagel I pre-ordered yesterday as an early birthday gift for my sister. ($35.80) I drag my stuff up half a block and go to donut pub, where I get a croissant donut and a water to eat there, and then several donuts to bring home (including a chocolate croissant donut for my mom). I have no idea how, but I manage to fit the donuts and backpacks in my already-full backpack, and head back to the subway. ($24.88)

12:00 PM: Against all odds, I make it to Moynihan with all 3 of my bags and baked goods, and I drop them at the Amtrak luggage hold. ($20) I'm so wiped out after carrying them around that I sit down on the ground and text my mom ""i understand rucking as a workout now""

12:15 PM: After catching my breath, I walk to the bus and take it to the Morgan Library & Museum. ($25) The building is gorgeous, and I see some really cool illuminated manuscripts, medieval maps, and a Kafka exhibit, but the exhibit on Belle da Costa Greene is easily the highlight. Incredibly well-curated and contextualized exhibit. On my way out, I stop by the gift shop and buy a sticker of da Costa Greene's custom book plate (""a book is a friend that never changes"") to put in my reading journal. ($3.27)

2:30 PM: My train isn't till 6:30, but I head back to the train station because I'm too tired to even think about fitting anything else into the day.

4:30 PM: Get a late lunch/early dinner from Burger Joint in the station. I get a burger, fries, and a diet coke. ($26.93)

5:00 PM: Right before picking my bags up, a blister on my toe bursts and is super painful. I'm frustrated because I have bandaids, but they're buried WAY in the bottom of my suitcase. I get cuts on my hands so often I know they'll eventually get used, so I suck it up and buy some from Walgreens so I don't empty out all my luggage in the middle of Moynihan. ($6.99) Toe taped up, I get my bags, which all smell like everything bagels now, and go sit in the ticketed waiting area.

6:30 PM: Head home and spend the whole train ride thinking about how nice it will be to not stand up a single time tomorrow.

**(Total: $343.73)**

**Comments**:

1. I was not physically prepared for this trip lol. I still had a great time, am glad I stuck (mostly) to my plans except when my planning was wrong, but having not-broken in shoes was a nightmare - I went to DC last week with the same pair and walked \~8 miles with barely any pain. I also pushed myself way too hard (I have some chronic health issues), but I luckily didn't have any commitments immediately post-trip and could afford to do so. The stomach stuff wasn't really something I could prepare for but was also a bummer!
2. Because it was my first multi-day solo trip that I totally planned myself, I went with a hotel that I thought was cute that I could mostly afford with points, and although I didn't mention it much in here it… really was not a great stay. In the future I'd either pay a little extra for a really nice place I could defray with points, or just pay cash for a Mariott or something where I know what I'm getting, but the place I stayed was just bad value.
3. I wouldn't stay in SoHo again. Convenient but ultimately not my vibe.
4. And finally, spending this much money was scary without an income but I'm so glad I let myself just do it and not over think stuff. The only ""budget"" I had was aiming to spend below my final paycheck + PTO payout, which combined was about $2100, so I did totally fine. For how exhausting it all was, this trip was genuinely healing for my burnout and really helped me ease into being unemployed in a way that's motivated me to keep doing stuff and not stay in the house all day, and I think spending a little extra was totally worth it to avoid the mental load of thinking about money the whole trip.",26,1744219497.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,5,0.96,False

1jvbdya,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jvbdya/friend_is_a_biohazard/,Friend Is a Biohazard,"Of my two best friends, I (30F) live with J (36M) who I’ve known for 5 years, and am also very close with C (37M) who I’ve known for 2 years. They are good friends as well, although I spend more time with them one-on-one than together. 

C comes from a place where dental care is not common. His teeth are visibly messed up-sure they stick out at strange angles, but it’s more unusual than off-putting, and doesn’t bother me. What does bother me is the SMELL. Sometimes it’s not perceptible at all, but other times you can smell it from up to 7 feet away, even if I know he’s brushed his teeth that day. It smells a bit like pond water, but -overwhelmingly- like dead animal. If we’re in the car together, the window has to be open in order to breathe; if we’re at coffee I typically look down, and when he speaks I cover my drink. We still spend time together because it hasn’t been too bad until it escalated recently. 

He’s very sensitive about the issue and worries people talk about it behind his back. As he has no insurance or extra money, I’ve gently suggested a new program in our area that fixes teeth if he feels insecure about it and is open to try, and even mentioned a time I dealt with similar health issues (I am severely immunocompromised and got an infection after mouth surgery, successfully treated). He was grateful for the info, but has made no effort to pursue it. 

C constantly complains he’s getting older now and still can’t get girls. He’s otherwise attractive, intelligent, very funny, has a cool very stable job, and lots of talent/knowledge/passion in his interests. He is charismatic with friends and otherwise an absolute joy to be around, and I have no idea how to tell him this is almost certainly the sole issue.

Flash to the other day- we had game night at our house, which we do often, and I made cocktails. He put his half-finished glass near the bookshelf, where I couldn’t find it for two days until I was doing a weekly deep cleaning and went looking for it. I was horrified to find a FULL glass with a diversity of mold and bacterial cultures (4+ individual), that had somehow managed to form in an alcohol glass in less than 2 days. My roommate J (who knows about our friend’s issue) saw it and is banning him from the house, and would like for my immune safety that neither of us hang out with C until the problem is fixed. He's right- in the past few months I have started seeing more signs of perio illness in myself and am worried I’ll have to go through treatment again, which was extremely rough on my body because of my illness. 

C has also expressed romantic interest in me in the past, to myself and our friends, which although he seems to have dropped, I'm not completely sure. I shut this down long ago and made it very clear we will not be partnered ever in the future. Still, I also want to be clear to him again that even if he fixed his teeth, our friendship will stay as-is. I am his closest friend, and am still wondering whether I should even be the one to mention this again, or if he needs to know other people have a problem with it. 

None of my previous recommendations that he get help for this have been taken seriously, how can I tell him if he doesn’t fix this issue, we won’t see each other again? 



TL;DR Close friend has emotionally sensitive dental hygiene-related health issue (worse than originally thought) and has begun endangering myself others by not treating it.

The whole sugar baby thing kind of felt like a natural fit for me—not just financially, but also in terms of attraction and dynamic. I recently started talking to a potential sugar daddy, and at first, it seemed promising. He’s older, successful, generous (at least from what he’s said), and was pretty straightforward about wanting a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Here’s the thing though—he hasn’t really made any effort to get to know me. Like, we’ve exchanged a few messages, nothing deep, and now he’s already set a date to meet… at a hotel. First meeting, no coffee, no lunch, no casual public interaction. Just straight to “meet me here” vibes—and it’s very clear he’s expecting sex.

I don’t know how to feel. On one hand, I went into this knowing that sex could definitely be part of it. I’m not naive. But I also expected at least some kind of connection first? Or at least a little chemistry or trust-building? Right now, it just feels a bit transactional and kinda icky.

I’m wondering if this is just how it goes in the sugar world, or if this is a red flag and I should dip out. Anyone else been in this situation?

1jvb3ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1jvb3ug/might_this_ice_maker_joy_pebble_review_help_you/,Might This Ice Maker Joy Pebble Review Help You Make the Best Choice?,"Having explored the world of portable ice makers, the Joy Pebble Ice Maker has become a standout for me. It's like having a personal Arctic factory that gives you perfectly crunchy nugget ice at your beck and call. As someone who relishes a chilled drink, this electrical gizmo seems to hit just the right spot.

**Ease of Use**

Operating this device is as easy as pie. With a simple control panel, you just add water, plug it in, and press the power button. It's a bit like setting your coffee machine for the morning brew. My 8-year-old nephew managed to get it up and running with little supervision, proving its user-friendly nature. Even when the ice bin is full, or it needs more water, the indicator light conveniently lets you know. The self-cleaning function, activated by holding the power button for a few seconds, is a lifesaver, sparing you the hassle of manual cleaning. I just wish all appliances had an ""ON/OFF"" button with such magical prowess.

**Ice Quality & Type**

The Joy Pebble machine impresses with its delicate, chewable nugget ice. Each piece retains its flavor and is perfect for cocktails, sodas, and iced coffee. Standing in my kitchen at an unearthly hour gulping down on these delightful ice nuggets has become a ritual. In truth, the texture is heaven-sent and fits the bill for icy lovers who dread clunky cubes. Even my friends, with their fancy drink concoctions, agree it’s unbeatable.

**Strengths**

* Efficient self-cleaning mode
* Easy to operate with clear indicators
* Compact and suitable for countertops

[Check Joy Pebble Z5815NB-BLACK price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0crdk7dfn/)

**Ice Production Speed**

As any evening host might attest, running out of ice mid-gathering is the ultimate party foul. This portable gem churns out ice nuggets at a blistering pace, pumping out up to 33 pounds of ice in a day. Each cycle, lasting about 14 minutes, produces 100 pieces. While testing, I had enough ice to fill several glasses for a spontaneous family lunch, and there was always a frosty stockpile when needed.

**Noise Levels**

In the bustling auditory landscape of a kitchen, the sound from this ice maker is noticeable, yet tolerable. It hums industriously, but it’s not what I’d call obtrusive. I was initially concerned after reading mixed reviews regarding noise, but it’s honestly quieter than my dishwasher. My mother, with her ever-polite nod, found it louder than expected during her afternoon nap, though.

**Durability**

This machine exhibits remarkable stability with its upgraded stainless steel exterior. Even amidst the chaos of kitchen dynamics, it's proven durable and resistant to corrosion, lasting beyond what typical portable appliances might. It's a pleasant surprise, given the relentless cycle of abuse equipped in daily usage by a clumsy clan like mine.

**Favorable Aspects**

* Durable stainless steel construction
* Produces up to 33 pounds of ice daily
* Stylish design with a small footprint

**Competitors**

Comparing this product to competitors like the GE Opal 2.0 and the Ikich Portable Ice Maker, it's evident each has its own perks. The GE Opal delivers similar crunchy nugget ice, but its price tag stretches beyond Joy Pebble’s. Meanwhile, Ikich offers swift ice cubes but lacks the satisfying nugget form for which Joy Pebble is renowned. Each has its strengths, but the ease and quality of nugget ice make the Joy Pebble machine an attractive contender in this market.

**Warranty**

The appliance's warranty, as expected, offers basic coverage, ensuring peace of mind. Although we tend not to think about warranties until a device sputters its last cycle, knowing Joy Pebble's customer service is responsive is a crucial backup plan. This assurance was highlighted in reviews, suggesting any warranty claims would be handled swiftly and efficiently.

**Value Proposition**

Considering the features packed into this ice wizard, its cost holds substantial value. Investing in Joy Pebble makes more sense for those who host frequently or crave nugget ice daily. While it might not be the most budgetary option, the quality you're receiving aligns well with the cash spent, making it a substantial purchase for discerning buyers.

I'm in need of some serious help, tbh the only way i can see of getting out of all this is to end my life, I don't want to but I can't see another out

I'm in my 30's and living with my mother and grandmother. Family is toxic and I now know so emotionally abusive to me as a child and adult including bullying and enmeshment and well, a whole list that I'm grappling with and feeling overwhelmed with now I'm listing it all out to hopefully take to a therapist.

I'm disabled, mental and physical health issues. My mum is overweight and grandmother is also disabled (recently care needs increased a bit, but she is independently mobile and also independent with toilet needs)

Mother is now a hermit, hasn't left the house since December. I ask her to speak to a dr or therapist, she dismisses is. I've told her to pop out and take a break and she says she doesn't want to. I've suggested the carers coffee morning, she asked what she'd want to speak to those people for. She's complaining constantly about caring, but then again refuses any help I've suggested, when I said I'd call in support she started a huge argument.

Anyway, I went away for a couple of days to do something I wanted to. I obviously had to call all the time to tell them when I was leaving the hotel, when I got back, when I left the hotel to walk to the place and call when I arrived. I did it as usual and my grandmother wanted to know as she wasn't well and worries.

When I came back I said that I did it, but going forward I would like to set some boundaries. I'll call but maybe once a day and not all the time and so I have some time for a real break.

Well, it was like I'd asked for something extreme. I then said I wasn't arguing, I just don't want this all the time. I was told I always 'start'. I said it's an issue we have communicating, my mother said there is no issue communicating, it's when I start arguing. Whenever I disagree or say something she doesn't like/agree with it kicks off a huge argument that somehow I started.

Now after a huge argument where she said her life is hell (but won't do a thing to change it or get help) she's being passive aggressive and muttering about me.

I know there are huge enmeshment issues, when I was at school I wasn't ever allowed on class trips unless she could be a chaperone and it was seen as me having a perfect mum. At home though she was asking me why I couldn't be more like my friends or berating me when I performed badly (I was a child performer) and saying everyone was laughing at me. One time made me cry all the way home from a 100 mile journey when I'd messed up a routine when I'd gone with the flu. Also my grandfather had just died tragically that September (this was November) and it was traumatic for me, I got OCD when he was in hospital for cancer treatment.

Our family is full of sociopaths and narcs, great aunts and stuff that filtered in. For example, one of my aunts used to pitch me against her favoured niece as a child and would be like, I'll get you two sweets, oh don't worry, I'll see you later K, I'll just bring them to your house, leaving me in the dark. Also getting extravagant gifts for her and me nothing, which then maed my mother sob when we'd come home and she'd ask why she didn't like me as much as her.

I can't do this anymore, but I can't afford to move and honestly don't have the energy or the physical fitness. I have no real support system that could help me if I move away, just a therapist and a few distant friends. But I can't do it anymore. It's all getting more and more toxic to the point that she attacks me about sitting outside in the garden (something she is free to do but won't).

I don't know what to do. I'm so stuck and I'm desperate for a life of my own, but this is my family, I of course love them and they've always been there for me and they're all I have.

Nothing can be worked through, if I bring any of this up it starts huge arguments and all ""why are you starting now? why today? oh, you had it so hard"" also a lot of ""it's only because...""

Also, it's not always bad, it's fine when it's good and there have been good times. I fear I've made her out to be a monster, but she's not, she does love me.

Sorry, I've rambled, I'm just so stuck.

like yeah, i get it—some of the AI stuff feels overhyped or like it’s gonna replace us, but that’s not the point. it’s not about replacing devs, it’s about supercharging us.

i’ve been using AI for everything from debugging weird ass errors that would’ve taken me an hour, to just writing boilerplate crud so i don’t have to. it’s like having a junior dev who never sleeps (and never complains, lol).

even for planning or refactoring, i just talk out loud (well, type) to chatGPT or whatever tool i’m using and boom—ideas, insights, sometimes stuff i didn’t even think of. feels like pair programming but with less arguing.

and no, it’s not perfect. sometimes it hallucinates or gives off weird vibes, but so do i on a bad coffee day. the point is—it helps.

if you’re a dev in 2025 and not using AI in your stack in some way, you’re falling behind. not cause “tech bro grindset” but because the tools are just too damn useful to ignore.

start small—use it for commits, for code review summaries, maybe even generate a README. it’ll creep into the rest of your workflow naturally, promise.

It’s our engagement anniversary, but we appreciate it more than our wedding anniversary, so it’s supposed to be a happy day…

However, I cried after I got home. It felt like the last straw. I haven’t been TTC for long, but I’ve been a fencesitter for quite some time, and I’ve had enough of people’s comments during that period.

And they seem to be increasing over time, and I can’t really tolerate them anymore.

They talk about TTC like it will happen immediately whenever you want it to.

A few days ago, my mom asked my husband what name he would give our future child.

The day before yesterday, my MIL called me while I was at work to wish me twins!!! And she literally told me, “If you didn’t try because of my son, don’t let it stop you.”

Today, my coworker (who is also my friend) told me, “Let’s try to have babies at the same time, like in June. What do you think?” — she wasn’t joking. She was really serious. She made TTC sound like, “Let’s go for a cup of coffee” or something.

The same coworker later said, ""Your younger sister had twins, and you're still thinking about baby number one? Really, let’s start trying in June!"". To which I replied “It’s not a fucking competition!!! And I’ll be in vacation in June, best of luck to you…”

😩Lies and betrayal on our anniversary? Unbelievable! 😡💔
""You've undergone IVF six times to conceive this child, Ms. Caldwell. Are you sure you want to give up? Is Mr. Spencer okay with this?""
""I'm sure he'll agree."" Callista Caldwell's voice is hoarse after a sleepless night. She's never felt more awake, though.
""I'll schedule the surgery for a week from now, then.""
It's Callista and Luther Spencer's wedding anniversary in a week. This is good—she can end things where they started.
After booking her flight out of the country, she places her hand on her abdomen. There's a blossoming life in there.
She's looked forward to this for the past five years. She never would've expected to give up on it before it could happen.
Chapter 1
The phone pinged again, showing the same trending topic that had been circulating for half a month.
Luther Spencer had spent a fortune on a luxurious estate. He had planted an entire garden of roses by hand to celebrate his fifth wedding anniversary.
Once again, he announced to the world that his heart belonged solely to Callista Caldwell.
Countless comments followed, and each of them was expressing envy for their love.
""Who says relationships with an age gap don't work out? Mr. Spencer's ultimate wedding gift is his hopeless devotion. It's said Mrs. Spencer is six years older, and it took him three years of relentless pursuit to win her over.""
""Everyone knows Mr. Spencer adores his wife. Two years ago, when Mrs. Spencer was trapped during the earthquake, Mr. Spencer risked his life to rescue her.
""He was covered in injuries when he was finally pulled out, and yet he was more set on comforting his terrified wife. The news even showed him holding her, and both of them were in tears.""
""And last year, when a media outlet mocked Mrs. Spencer for her age and claimed she couldn't have children, Mr. Spencer sued them into bankruptcy.
""He even made a public statement saying he didn't care whether they had children or not, but he would never allow anyone to hurt his wife over it.""
Callista couldn't help but force a bitter smile as she read these comments.
Luther truly did ensure no one could hurt her. Yet every pain she ever felt was dealt by him.
When Callista first confirmed her pregnancy, she had been eager to share the good news with Luther. But then she received a message from an unknown sender.
It was a photograph of a pregnant woman.
The young woman's smile was radiant as she posed for the pregnancy photograph. Meanwhile, Luther knelt beside her. He was reverently kissing her rounded belly. His face was filled with joy and contentment.
Tears streamed down Callista's face.
The ultrasound image she had suffered through six rounds of IVF to obtain now felt like a cruel joke.
On their wedding day, Luther had sworn he would love only her for the rest of his life. But it turned out the so-called ""rest of his life"" lasted only five years.
If that was the case, Callista decided she no longer wanted Luther in her life. And her child would not be born into a web of lies.
The door creaked open. Callista's tear-streaked, blood-shot eyes met Luther's, and he immediately panicked.
""What's wrong, honey? What happened? Don't cry—I'll fix it.""
He glanced at the ultrasound image on the table. Without looking too closely, he pulled her into his arms.
""It's okay if the IVF didn't work. Even if we never have kids, it doesn't matter. Having you is enough for me.
""Shh, don't cry anymore. It hurts me to see you like this.""
Callista gave a smile that looked worse than crying.
This man was such a hypocrite.
His child with someone else was about to be born, and yet he was saying this to her face.
Luther didn't notice the change in her demeanor and continued comforting her. ""Cally, our anniversary is in a week. I've planted an entire sea of roses for you and prepared blue fireworks. I'll set them off for you to see, okay?
""Isn't blue your favorite color?""
Callista stared at him blankly. She was still smiling even as tears rolled down her cheeks.
It seemed he didn't remember. She had never liked the color blue.
""Then, in a week, I'll give you an anniversary gift too,"" she said.
Luther's eyes lit up with excitement as he carefully wiped away her ""tears of joy.""
""Honey, I can't wait. I'm looking forward to your surprise.""
Callista silently stared at the ultrasound image.
She hoped that when the time came, Luther would truly be surprised.
Chapter 2
At noon the next day, Luther took Callista to the Spencer residence for lunch.
Luther's mother, Jane Dawson, never liked Callista. She didn't even bother to show up on their wedding day.
After the marriage, Luther moved out with Callista, only visiting his family at the end of each month.
""Honey, whatever it is that my mom says later, don't take it to heart. I'm always on your side. We'll leave right after lunch,"" Luther reassured Callista while holding her hand.
The moment they stepped through the door, Callista heard Jane's laughter.
""Oh, such a sweet baby! Those tiny hands and feet just melt my heart.""
Callista turned pale, and her feet were rooted to the ground. She recognized the woman sitting next to Jane—it was the same woman from the pregnancy photo.
""This is my friend's daughter, Wren Kirk,"" Jane introduced.
""She's pregnant, and her family's overseas, so they asked me to take care of her. I just took her to her prenatal checkup this morning.""
Jane linked arms with Wren and approached them. She handed Luther an ultrasound photo with a meaningful glance.
""Take a good look. Doesn't the baby resemble the parents?""
A flicker of panic crossed Luther's face as he responded with a faint warning in his tone, ""Mom, stop joking around. How would I know? This is my first time meeting Wren.""
Jane cast a glance at Callista and then pushed Wren forward. ""Well then, let me properly introduce you. Wren, this Luther.""
Wren's cheeks turned pink as she said, ""Hey, Luther.""
Luther gave a slight nod, then pulled Callista closer with one arm. ""And this is my wife. Callista.""
""Nice to meet you, Callista,"" Wren said softly.
Callista felt utterly numb. Her hands that were hanging by her sides began to tremble uncontrollably.
So, the entire Spencer family knew about Wren. She was the only one kept in the dark.
""What's wrong?"" Luther immediately grew concerned.
""Are you feeling faint from low blood sugar?""
He quickly retrieved some candy he always carried with him, unwrapped one, and brought it to her lips.
Callista opened her mouth mechanically. Though it was candy, all she could taste was bitterness.
Luther instructed the housekeeper to start serving the meal. He was still holding her hand as they sat down.
""You barely ate breakfast. Have more for lunch,"" he said gently.
Callista silently picked up her glass of water, but Luther swapped it out for a warm one.
""Your period's coming soon. You shouldn't drink anything cold, or your stomach will hurt again.
""The prawns today look good. Let me peel some for you.""
Luther barely ate throughout the meal as he was constantly tending to Callista and ensuring her plate was never empty.
""Luther is so good to his wife. I'm honestly jealous of Callista,"" Wren suddenly remarked. ""I love prawns too. Luther, could you peel some for me as well?""
Wren slid her plate toward him, but Luther acted as if he didn't see it.
""If you want prawns, peel them yourself. I only peel them for my wife,"" he replied.
Callista took a sip of the warm water while suppressing the urge to retch. ""Give them to her. I don't want any.""
Luther froze for a moment, then playfully pouted like a child.
""Fine, I'll eat them myself. Cally, how could you give away the prawns I peeled for you?""
Callista's eyes glinted with sarcasm. They'd already slept together, yet they still pretended otherwise.
Jane set her utensils down with a dark expression. ""Callista, wasn't this your sixth IVF failure? Since Wren is here, why don't you get some tips from her?""
""Mrs. Spencer, I don't really have much experience myself,"" Wren replied. She blushed as she shook her head.
""My boyfriend and I conceived on the first try. It just happened to be my birthday, so maybe being in a good mood helped.""
""Well, my daughter-in-law here is ten years older than you. She's not really comparable to you,"" Jane said with a mocking tone.
""I'm planning to let Wren move into the house so I can take better care of her. Plus, maybe her luck will rub off, and I'll have a house full of grandchildren soon.""
The moment she finished speaking, Luther cut her off firmly. ""I don't agree.""
Jane's gaze turned even colder as she looked at Callista. ""Why not? Just because someone here can't conceive, they just can't bear to see others succeed either?""
""Are you done?"" Luther's voice was icy.
""Mom, if you're determined to make me stop coming here altogether, then by all means, keep going.""
""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause trouble."" Wren stood up with teary eyes and hurried away.
Luther instinctively took a step forward as if to chase her but stopped himself, realizing how inappropriate it would be.
""I'm done,"" Callista said coldly as she watched the drama unfold. She stood and left without hesitation.
The moment she walked out of the Spencer residence's gates, a notification appeared on her phone—a verification message from Wren.
""March 5th is my birthday. That was our first time. He didn't let me leave the bed all day.""
That day, Callista had suffered her fifth IVF failure. She hadn't eaten or drunk anything and had locked herself in her room for an entire day and night.
When she finally gathered the strength to open the door, she'd found Luther disheveled while sitting outside her room. She had even pitied him and comforted him.
As it turned out, Luther had just rushed home from Wren's bed.
How ridiculous. How tragic.
She endured endless injections without complaint for five years. Yet now, the pain in her chest was unbearable, making it hard to breathe.
""Why are you crying, honey?""
Luther had followed her out. Seeing that her face was streaked with tears, he panicked and instinctively glanced at her phone.
Chapter 3
The phone screen dimmed automatically. Luther didn't pay much attention to it and pulled Callista into his arms. He gently patted her back.
""Shh, don't cry. It hurts me to see you like this.
""It's my fault. I shouldn't have brought you here just to upset you. She's my mother—you don't have to put up with her for my sake.
""You can yell at me or hit me if it makes you feel better.""
On the way home, Luther spent the entire ride trying to comfort her. Callista simply closed her eyes and pretended to sleep.
Occasionally, the sound of message notifications echoed in the car. Luther was busy replying to them for the second half of the drive.
When they arrived home, Luther stroked her head.
""Honey, there's an urgent matter at work that I need to handle. Wait for me here, and I'll come back early tonight, okay?""
Callista quietly got out of the car.
After Luther left, she accepted Wren's friend request and opened her social media feed. Pinned at the top of her profile were two photos.
The first was of Luther's back as he planted roses. The second was a sea of blue roses.
The caption read, ""Considering someone took the time to plant my favorite blue roses, I'll forgive you this once. Come and make it up to me.""
Callista's chest tightened at the sight. So Wren was the one who loved blue. Even the roses he planted for their anniversary weren't for her.
She hailed a cab and went straight to the estate. As soon as she arrived, she saw Luther's black Bentley parked nearby.
In the distance, Luther stood with his back to her in front of the sea of roses. He was unaware of her presence.
""If Callista could have children, I wouldn't have needed you. She's where I draw my line. How dare you show up in front of her and throw a tantrum?""
Wren's eyes brimmed with tears. ""Then why come to me at all? Just leave me alone!""
""Don't cry,"" Luther said. His tone softened. ""As long as you behave, I'll take care of you for life.""
Wren wiped her tears and smiled before throwing herself into his arms. ""I can be even better if that's what you want.""
""I cleared an entire afternoon for this. Do you really not know what I want?"" Luther's voice was hoarse as he scooped Wren into his arms and carried her toward the estate.
Just then, Wren glanced back and smirked at Callista. She had seen Callista standing there the whole time.
Through the windows, shadows of their entangled figures swayed and flickered. Callista stood frozen on the roadside. Her chest was heaving with every labored breath.
It felt like a barbed hook had torn into her heart, and each pull left behind a fresh, bleeding wound.
""Are you here to take pictures too? Mr. Spencer and Mrs. Spencer still have such a loving relationship after all these years. It's really enviable,"" a woman nearby remarked with a smile as she snapped some photos.
""Mrs. Spencer must have saved the galaxy in her past life. Every woman dreams of having a husband like Mr. Spencer.""
Callista laughed bitterly as tears streamed down her face. ""But she doesn't want him anymore.""
This so-called estate Luther gave her, symbolizing his devotion, was nothing more than a place where he slept with another woman.
The woman then stared at Callista and became somewhat stunned. It wasn't surprising she'd mistaken Wren for Callista.
After all, Wren bore an uncanny resemblance to Callista at 24, the year she first met Luther.
""I guess men are all the same,"" the woman murmured. Her tone turned despondent.
""At least Mr. Spencer is somewhat decent. He probably just wants a child too badly, even going so far as to find someone who looks just like you.
""Why not let it go? Pretend you don't know. Life will go on as usual.""
""It wouldn't be the same,"" Callista said quietly.
The fact that Luther sought out a woman who resembled her didn't make her feel grateful; it only made her feel disgusted.
After leaving the rose garden, Callista went to the hospital and collected pre-procedure medication for an abortion.
She placed the medicine on the coffee table and stared at it for a long time. She was still overwhelmed by a suffocating ache.
Suddenly, the door burst open. Luther rushed in with his shirt buttoned unevenly. He tripped and nearly knocked over a chair in his haste.
He scanned her from head to toe with a pale face. ""Honey, why did you go to the hospital?""
Chapter 4
Callista's medical card was linked to Luther's phone number, so the notification about her visit and prescription was sent to him.
""Honey, say something! You're scaring me,"" Luther pleaded anxiously.
Callista handed him the bag of medicine, and she lied, ""The doctor suggested I try a new medication. It might improve the success rate of the next IVF attempt.""
""As long as you're okay, that's all that matters. You scared me to death.""
Luther didn't even glance at the bag and casually placed it on the coffee table.
Callista let out a cold laugh.
In the past, he would always meticulously read the instructions no matter what medication she was prescribed as he was worried about potential side effects.
He used to say he couldn't bear the physical pain of IVF for her, but he needed to remind himself that she was suffering for his sake.
Now, she had personally handed him the pre-procedure medication for an abortion, and he didn't even bother to look at it.
The unfamiliar scent of perfume mixed with the aroma of roses in the air made Callista feel nauseous, and soon, her stomach began to cramp. She clutched her abdomen in discomfort.
""Is it your period?"" Luther leaned in, trying to warm her stomach with his hands.
Callista swatted his hand away.
""The smell on you is disgusting,"" she said bluntly.
Luther sniffed himself and chuckled.
""It's probably the scent of roses. I've been going to the rose garden several times a day, trying to make sure everything is perfect for our fifth anniversary. I'll go shower and change my clothes.""
But earlier, he'd said he was going to the office.
Callista couldn't be bothered to expose his lie and simply replied, ""Alright.""
After Luther left, Callista picked up her phone.
For the past five years, her social circle revolved entirely around Luther, leaving her with no close friends of her own.
If she were to leave him, there weren't many people she needed to inform, except for her younger brother, Kai Caldwell. Kai was also her only remaining family member.
But as she stared at his number, she couldn't bring herself to call.
Kai held Luther in high regard as his brother-in-law, and she worried it would complicate things. It was better to wait until she was ready to leave.
That night, Luther lay beside her while gently massaging her stomach.
""Honey, I've delegated all my work for the next two days. Your first couple of days on your period are always the worst, and I can't leave you alone.""
Callista gave a nonchalant response, not taking his words to heart.
Then, a notification sound woke her up in the middle of the night.
""Sorry, did I wake you? There's some work I need to take care of. I'll put my phone on silent. Go back to sleep, honey,"" Luther said softly.
Callista kept her eyes closed, but she was no longer sleepy.
Luther's left hand continued massaging her stomach, while his right hand was free to reply to messages. The warmth of his touch and the occasional low chuckles he couldn't suppress felt like a dull blade cutting into her, one stroke at a time.
""Honey?"" he whispered, testing the waters.
As he hoped, Callista didn't respond.
Luther withdrew his hand, quietly got out of bed, and tiptoed out of the room. Even as he moved silently, his eagerness was palpable.
""How dare you send those kinds of pictures over? Just wait—I'll make sure you can't get out of bed tomorrow,"" he muttered before the door clicked shut.
Moments later, Callista's phone buzzed several times. It was a message from Wren.
""Are you getting old and unattractive, Cally? Luther's been so pent up that he couldn't get enough of me this afternoon.
""He even said he wanted to try something new with me tonight. Can you believe it? He has no consideration for this poor pregnant woman.
""Honestly, I feel bad for you. Luther did plenty of the work to make me pregnant. Meanwhile, you're stuck with sterile IVF procedures, and you still can't conceive.""
Even in the bedroom that was warmed by the heater, Callista felt frozen to the core.
She got up, retrieved a hot water bottle, and climbed back into bed.
For five years, she'd believed she had met Luther too late in life and that their time together would be too short.
But now, with only five days left, she found the time to be unbearably long.
Chapter 5
Callista went to bed late and woke up late as well. As she stepped out of the bedroom, Luther came through the door while holding a bag in his hands.
""Honey, I bought your favorite honey garlic prawns,"" he announced while presenting the package as if it were a treasure.
""I rushed back to keep them warm for you. Eat them while they're hot.""
In the past, whenever Luther upset her, he would buy honey garlic prawns to cheer her up.
Callista never particularly liked them, but she always forgave him—not because of the prawns, but because she loved him.
What was this gesture for today? Was it to ease his guilt after spending the whole night with another woman?
""Honey, did you see the message I sent before I went out? When did you wake up?""
For some reason, Luther felt a vague unease over Callista's recent demeanor.
""No, I just woke up,"" Callista replied as she picked up her fork. She wouldn't let herself go hungry because of him.
When he saw her calm expression that seemed to have no trace of anger, Luther finally relaxed. ""I'll take care of some work first. When you're done eating, I'll join you for a walk.""
Callista continued eating while opening her phone.
Wren had just posted a new update.
""He spoils me so much. I casually mentioned wanting honey garlic prawns, and he immediately went out to get them for me.""
Attached to the post was a photo of a bag of the honey garlic prawns—the same ones Callista was eating out of.
Meanwhile, Luther let out a soft laugh across the table. Seconds later, a new comment appeared under Wren's post.
Luther replied, ""It's good that you're self-aware.""
Not long after, Jane chimed in with her own comment.
""Of course, he should spoil you. Just tell us whatever you want. You're a hero—not like someone else who takes up space but can't even conceive.""
Jane's comment was visible to Luther as well.
Callista glanced up. She was curious to see his reaction. He didn't seem bothered at all. In fact, he was wearing a smile. His expression was filled with warmth and contentment.
Callista chuckled to herself. She pulled up Jane's profile and blocked her on all platforms in one swift move. She had been wanting to do that for a long time.
Before Callista could finish breakfast, Luther's phone rang. It was Jane.
Her sharp voice practically burst through the speaker, and Luther frowned as he looked at Callista.
""Mom said she wants to bring you some herbal medicine. Did you block her?""
""There's no need. I'm not drinking it.""
Jane had a habit of sending her strange, bitter herbal remedies, none of which were helpful. Callista had forced herself to choke them down over the years, only to endure Jane's passive-aggressive remarks about wasting her kindness.
""But you can't just—""
Even if Jane couldn't send her messages anymore, the old ones were still there. Callista slid her phone across the table toward Luther.
The most recent message from Jane read, ""A woman who can't have children is worthless. You couldn't even keep the one you managed to conceive.
""You're such a failure. I won't allow the Spencer family lineage to end with you.""
Callista had been pregnant once in their first year of marriage.
But the baby's heartbeat suddenly stopped at seven months, and she was forced to undergo an induced labor.
Jane had made countless remarks blaming her over the years.
Callista, however, knew Luther had always tried to mediate and spoke up for her in front of his mother. Not wanting to make things harder for him, she had never brought it up.
But this time, Luther frowned at Callista.
""She's still my mom. You should try to understand her a little,"" he said.
""And who's supposed to understand me?""
Callista retorted with a cold laugh. ""Luther, you know how devastated I was back then.""
""But have you ever considered that there might have been a reason for the miscarriage?"" Luther sighed.
""Maybe you ate something you shouldn't have, or perhaps you used the wrong cosmetics…""
Tears spilled down Callista's face instantly.
""Don't cry,"" Luther said. He realized that he had said the wrong thing. ""I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.""
During her first pregnancy, Callista had been more careful than anyone else. She hadn't worn makeup even once, avoided eating out entirely, and refused to travel anywhere far.
When she lost the baby, her entire world collapsed. Luther stayed by her side every moment, never leaving her alone, and took care of her 24/7.
He had reassured her over and over. ""Honey, it's not your fault. Even if we never have children, it doesn't matter. You're all I care about.""
Luther was there for an entire month. He had pulled her back out of the abyss.
But now, she finally understood. He also believed it was her fault the baby didn't survive.
Chapter 6
""I'm sorry. You can hit me or yell at me. Just don't cry,"" Luther pleaded as he pulled Callista into his arms.
""I was spouting nonsense. I deserve whatever punishment you give me.""
Callista couldn't free herself from his embrace, and her tears continued to fall. But deep down, she knew the truth.
Luther hadn't simply misspoken; he was trying to shift all the blame onto her, to justify his infidelity as something inevitable.
Luther grew increasingly remorseful as he said, ""I'll make everything clear to my mom. You can consider unblocking her once she learns to respect you, okay?""
Tears streamed down Callista's face, but she smiled bitterly. Little did he know, there was no future for them anymore.
For the next two days, Luther stayed home to keep her company. Even though Callista barely acknowledged him, he busied himself with cooking all her favorite dishes.
Meanwhile, Wren's social media was filled with updates.
Baby supplies Luther ordered for Wren had arrived. He had booked a top-tier postpartum care center for her.
There were even specially prepared meals for expectant mothers, delivered personally by Luther. And he had left a ""like"" under every post.
That evening, as Luther brought her water for a foot soak, his phone rang.
""It's your brother,"" he said, putting it on speaker. ""He said he just landed a big client and is celebrating. He wants us to join.""
Kai's voice came through the line. ""Hey, Cally, it's been ages since I've seen you. Come with Luther, okay?""
With only two days left before she planned to leave, Callista didn't know when she might see her brother again. Hence, she couldn't refuse him.
""Okay.""
Kai had arranged a small barbecue gathering in the Caldwell residence's backyard.
When Callista and Luther arrived, Kai greeted them warmly.
""Cally, I know you don't like the smell of smoke, so I had them put all the cigarettes away. Pretty thoughtful of me, right?""
Before Callista could reply, someone nearby exposed him. ""Liar! It was Luther who reminded everyone to put the cigarettes away.""
""Luther truly treats Callista like a queen,"" another teased.
""He has to! Otherwise, why would I accept him as my brother-in-law?"" Kai laughed.
Luther rolled up his sleeves and started grilling Callista's favorite meat.
""My wife deserves everything good in life,"" he declared.
""Honey, sit here. Don't let the smoke bother you. Tell me what you want to eat, and I'll grill it for you.""
Callista stayed silent as she was not in the mood to play along.
Suddenly, Kai spoke up. ""Luther, we're out of drinks. Come help me grab a few cases from the basement.""
Luther patted Callista's head gently. ""Wait here, I'll be right back.""
As soon as they left, Callista's phone buzzed with a location pin from Wren. She was at the Caldwell residence too.
Callista's heart clenched. Fearing Kai might act impulsively, she got up and followed them. But the tense confrontation she had imagined didn't happen.
Instead, she saw the three of them standing together, chatting and laughing.
Wren looped her finger around Luther's, and her tone was playful as she said, ""Your son's been kicking me a lot. He must miss his dad.""
""Luther, I'll leave you two to it. I'll grab the drinks myself."" Kai grinned mischievously, and he walked off to give them space.
As soon as he walked away, Luther pulled Wren into his arms. ""So, only my son misses me?""
""You already know the answer to that,"" Wren teased.
Luther chuckled, kissing her as they headed into a room—Callista's childhood bedroom.
Callista's blood ran cold, and her legs nearly gave out beneath her.
She thought back to when her parents passed away in an accident. She had only been 13, and she had begun juggling school and multiple jobs to support Kai.
For her brother, she had taken on every dirty, exhausting task imaginable.
Kai had cried so hard as he walked her down the aisle on her wedding day. He was barely able to speak through his sobs.
""If Luther ever bullies you, come home, Cally. Your room will always be here for you.""
But now, the two people she loved most had joined forces to deliver the cruelest blow. [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1744217885.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False

I wanted to ask: if I’m traveling in the morning from Plaça de Catalunya to Eixample Dreta with a backpack and a suitcase, is it safer to walk or take the metro? I tend to be quite anxious and panicky, and the stories about teenagers ganging up on people in the metro haven’t exactly helped.

I also wanted to check: are the luggage lockers in the city safe? Am I likely to become a target while trying to store my suitcase? (I’ll only be able to leave my suitcase at the hotel in the afternoon.) I’m tall and blonde from Northern Europe, so I don’t stand much of a chance of blending in as anything other than a tourist. 

That said, I’ve been to Madrid, Malta, Lisbon and Florence, and I’ve never felt unsafe—nothing has ever happened to me. 

Lastly, I was hoping to read at least a few books on this trip—but from what I understand, sitting calmly with an e-reader and a cup of coffee in a café might not be realistic, since I’d need to stay hyper-aware of my surroundings. I have also already bought a strap for my mobile phone, maybe I should get it to e-reader as well?

I grabbed this Buck Mason shirt last week after wandering past one of their stores. They call it draped twill and it's a rayon/cotton blend. It's very cool to the touch and I'm a big fan of how it moves- it's almost slinky, but with just enough structure to hold itself together without going full viscose vacation shirt. Got it in navy and off white, and I can definitely see myself making the navy part of my regular rotation (I love the idea of a white shirt, but if it's anything nicer than a tee, someone will spill coffee across the room and a drop will find it's way to me).

The low slung fit of these really lends itself to a more relaxed top, and as someone who loves a high rise, fitted top block, I'm slowly coming around to the anti-fit, hangs off your hips look. These have also softened up incredibly in the month I've had them and are basically lightweight sweatpants.


Accessories are pretty bare bones.

1jvalps,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1jvalps/whats_it_actually_like_beyond_the_bump/,What's it actually like... beyond the bump?,"I'm a planner to my core, and more than a little type A. My spouse and I aren't pregnant yet, but as a planner, I find myself perusing these subs and trying to get a feel of what to plan for. I know I can't plan for everything, and I also know that theoretical feelings are very different than how people say they feel (or what they realize they need) once a baby is actually born. But as two self-employed people who won't have help, I find myself wanting to at least be intentional about research. Being that we're both self-employed, we have no PTO, no maternity or paternity leave, etc. We also live in a state with no short-term disability, so that's another reason we're planning well in advance: so we can sock away money to pad the time one or both of us won't be working. And we will have no village or help, even in the form of temporary visits from grandparents or what have you. Basically, we're completely on our own. No additional resources of any kind. 

That being said, I'm having a hard time understanding some of the things I read here and on other subs, and I'd love if people could weigh in with their takes. (Note: I'm not judging. I'm genuinely trying to understand what I cannot yet relate to.) For example, I often read posts where people are mad if their husband wants to go do plans a few weeks PP. From the perspective of a spouse being there for his partner during such a vulnerable, emotional, and hormonal time, I totally get it. (I've done IVF, so while I haven't experienced pregnancy hormones, I've had a window into what hormones can do to our physical and emotional well being.) On the other hand though, I think I struggle with the concept of being holed up in the house for months post-birth. Like 3 weeks post-birth for example is so fresh, but I'm also struggling to conceptualize not wanting to do plans or be social for that amount of time (or, realistically, longer). Like I feel like I'd wanna go on coffee runs, go out to lunch or dinner, go to a show...? And yes, I understand the mechanics of PP recovery and the importance of baby bonding. It just seems like huge stretches of time to plan for being locked up at home.

There's a lot that feels hush-hush about pregnancy and childbirth. I have friends who have been pregnant and have young children, but as a childless person, it feels like I'm left out of those intimate conversations of what it's really like, and like those interactions are reserved from one mama friend to another. And I think that's hard for me with all the factors I feel like I need to juggle to have a child. I don't want to expect that I won't want outside childcare or a well-vetted babysitter for a year or more, for example, only to find out 5 weeks PP that I'd do anything to go out to dinner with just my husband and feel a little pretty.

I know people who have waited two years for a date night or other kinds of solo or couple plans. I also know people who strap their newborn and are out and about for dinner and drinks after like 6 weeks. I can't possibly know what I'd want, but when you have no village, no time off, no supplementary income, it feels like I need to plan for what I *think* I'd want. Right now, I think that's to retain some aspects of my pre-kid life, as I go stir crazy at home for long. That being said, there's a part of me that's like ""No, you'll probably be so obsessed with your baby that you may surprise yourself, and your desire to be out of the house all the time will wash away.""

I'd love to hear your experience in the immediate aftermath/time beyond the bump, especially for your first kid. I'm worried we're oversaving and overplanning, but I'm also terrified of ending up pregnant and not being able to afford what we might need (self-funded mat/pat leave, childcare, any other things we may need to outsource with no village) to not further stress ourselves when already experiencing such a lifechanging experience. I don't want to be stuck at home and miserable, as we won't have a grandma or grandpa to call up to give me an hour or two to myself.

TL;DR: It's hard for me, as a childless person, to understand what life is like beyond the bump. Just trying to solicit experiences from all walks of life because I'm starting to worry that what we think we'll want/need will be so different than what we actually want/need, and with no help or village we're worried about taking the leap too soon (orrrrr waiting too long, and we're getting too old for that). Please be gentle if you can. It's very hard to wrap our heads around all of this when we have no familial or systemic help to ease the transition, and neither of us have moms or sisters we can go to to ask these sorts of questions. :(",5,1744217516.0,beyondthebump,17,1.0,False
1jvakwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepless_night/comments/1jvakwu/i_stayed_in_a_rental_cabin_with_one_rulenever/,I Stayed in a Rental Cabin with One Rule—Never Look Out the Window After Midnight,"

I booked the cabin for peace and quiet.

After a brutal breakup and a messy apartment lease dispute, I needed to get away. My therapist suggested solitude. Nature. “Reclaim your headspace,” she said.

I found a listing for a remote cabin in upstate New York. It had good reviews, except one odd comment:

>

The cabin was charming. Old wooden floors, a working fireplace, warm lighting, and a tiny bookshelf filled with classics and horror novels (fitting). The only thing that felt off was the large window facing the forest. It was huge—nearly floor-to-ceiling. No curtains. Just open glass staring into dark, endless woods.

On the first night, I lit a fire, made some tea, and started reading *Pet Sematary*. The silence was soothing—no sirens, no traffic, no phone buzz. Just the occasional hoot of an owl.

Around 12:10 a.m., I got up to use the bathroom. As I passed the window, I felt it—*that* feeling. You know the one. Like something is watching you. I stopped. Goosebumps ran up my arms.

Out of habit or curiosity—I’m not sure—I turned toward the window.

But I didn’t look.

I remembered the comment in the review. My brain mocked me. “You really think not looking out a window will protect you?” Still, something in my gut said *don’t*. So, I moved on.

The second night, the air changed.

It started around midnight again. I was lying on the couch, half-asleep, when I heard *something*. A faint tapping. Like a fingernail on glass. Tap. Tap. Pause. Tap tap.

I froze.

I didn’t want to believe it was the window, but… where else could it be coming from?

I sat up slowly. The tapping stopped.

Silence.

I forced myself to not look. Instead, I grabbed my phone and turned on the voice recorder. Placed it near the window. Went to bed.

In the morning, I listened to the recording.

It captured the taps.

But around the 17-minute mark, I heard a faint voice. A *whisper*. So soft I had to turn the volume up full.  
It said:

>

I slammed the laptop shut.

That day, I emailed the host.

>

She replied two hours later.

>

The smiley face made it worse.

By the third night, I was barely sleeping. I didn’t want to stay, but I’d paid for five nights and my pride wouldn’t let me leave early. Dumb, I know.

That night, it rained.

Hard.

The sound on the roof was deafening. Around 12:30, I woke up. I was on the couch again, curled in a blanket, fire dead out. The cabin was *cold*.

I sat up and felt drawn toward the window. I don’t know how to explain it, but it was like something was *pulling* my attention toward it. Like a magnet for my eyes.

I stood up, fully intending to go back to the bedroom.

But my head turned. On its own.

Just a little. Not all the way. But enough.

Enough to see *something*.

It stood in the tree line.

Tall. Too tall. Over 7 feet at least.

Long arms. Pale skin. No clothes.

No face.

Just… the *suggestion* of one. Like someone had started drawing a face, then erased most of it. I couldn’t make out details. Just void-like sockets where eyes should be.

It was standing *perfectly* still.

Facing the cabin.

I jerked my head away. Heart racing.

I stood frozen for five minutes. Maybe ten. Finally, I moved toward the fireplace, lit a match with shaking hands, and restarted the fire. I didn’t sleep.

When the sun rose, I dared to look out again.

Nothing.

Just trees.

I packed a bag and left for town. Got coffee. Sat in the car for hours. At one point, I almost booked a hotel room.

But again—*pride*. Stupid, stubborn pride.

That night was the last.

I brought the axe from the shed inside. Just in case.

I stayed up. Lights on. Music playing. No silence.

Midnight came and went.

No tapping. No whispers.

I thought maybe I was free.

But at 3:12 a.m., the power went out.

Total darkness.

And then—

A knock.

Not a tap. Not a whisper. A *knock*.

From the window.

Three slow, heavy knocks.  
**Knock.**  
**Knock.**  
**Knock.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

Then I heard it.

A second knock. From the other side of the cabin. Then another. And another.  
Knocking from every wall. Every side. The back door. The front. Even the roof.

Like something—no, *many* things—were surrounding the cabin.

Knocking.

In rhythm.

I covered my ears. Curled up on the floor.

Then, a voice came from the window.

The same whisper as before, but louder now.

>

I screamed.

And then everything stopped.

The lights flicked back on.

The fire crackled again, like it had never gone out.

Silence.

I ran out barefoot into the night, got in the car, and drove.

I didn’t look back once.

It’s been three weeks.

Back in my apartment. Life’s almost normal again.

Except… every night at 3:12 a.m., I wake up.

To the sound of knocking.

And a whisper just outside my bedroom window:

The thing is, he looked alright. Chiseled jaw. Clean haircut. Said thanks, mate to the barista. Probably held doors open for old ladies.He knew the rules. Played the part.
But inside, most days, he was flatlining.
He wanted to cry but hadn’t in years.He figured the tears dried up around the same time his ambition did.Now he just carried this dull ache—like a piercing in his soul that never fully arrived, just hovered.
He’d go to the gym, scroll the apps, answer emails, eat chicken and rice. Laugh at the memes, drop a fire emoji on someone’s story, maybe repost a reel of a shredded guy telling him to embrace discipline.It all blurred into static.
Men aren’t allowed to feel anything except rage and ridicule.And he didn’t feel like raging.Didn’t feel like laughing either.So what was left?
Fine.
That was the word. That’s all he ever said.
“Yeah man, all good.”Which meant: I’m barely holding it together, but you’re not really asking.
He was always one bad week away.And lately, every week had been flirting with the line.
But you don’t call that depression, do you?Not when you're paying rent, lifting weights, eating clean.Not when your suffering isn’t dressed for the part.
You get told to be grateful.
He didn’t want to die.He just didn’t want to do this.The endless loop of Get better. Be better. Do more.The world sold it like purpose, but it tasted like punishment.
We laugh at the wrong things.Make heroes of the worst people.Let clowns sell us dreams.
He watched another influencer scream through a smile, telling men to dominate or be dominated.Closed the app.Put his phone on charge.Stared at the ceiling.
He remembered being a kid.Back when the world still felt wide enough to disappear into.Before it got narrowed down to debt, deadlines, and dopamine fixes.
Men aren’t allowed to feel anything except rage and ridicule.So he chose neither.
He chose stillness.Silence.Survival.
He got up at six. Gym. Cold shower. Black coffee.Business as usual.

A complaint heard from a man in black shorts as he walks alongside his friend, a bit shorter than he is, yet has the audacity to wear clothes that he claims to be ""oversized"", he slowed down as he turned behind to see his friend lagging behind him. “It’s been awhile, might as well take advantage of you being here.” He explained. A breeze hit his face as they now walked side by side. “Yeah, but why walk? I just got my license.” The taller one questions, “Exercise-” his friend answered, tapping on his leg to emphasize his point. 

The shorter of the two look up at his face to notice his eyes slowly closing yet reopening every few seconds along with the shadows on his lower eyelid . Evidence of his late night escapades ""Besides, this might be good for you."" He assumes, as both of them stop to let cars pass by them. ""All I need is a cinnamon roll from that cafe you've been raving about."" He declares, wiping his eyes. ""They got the best coffee in town, though I don't really go for the coffee."" He confessed, they both crossed the empty street. The taller guy's eyebrows squinted as he thought about what his friend said to him. ""How'd you know they have good coffee then?"" He asked, confused at the man's recommendation. ""Just trust me on this."" He assured his friend as they perused around a familiar street. Of which some parts smelt like asphalt, passing by  houses with decent paint jobs and stepping on the rocky road. Small rocks crushed to pebbles by the weight of their feet. 

Motorbikes speeding past them as they navigate through the town, weaving through people as they talked. The shorter man reached into his pocket to check the time on his phone every couple of seconds. ""You waiting on a text?"" His friend inquires, noticing his friend constantly reaching for his phone, he shrugs off his friend's question. The smell of freshly baked bread wafting through the air as they stop by a bakery. Baked goods on display protected by a glass shield. ""Kaleb, there's something I need to tell you."" The shorter of the two reveals, Kaleb was inspecting the goods, although nods as a response as he sifts through the array of baked goods, his eyes glistening to the pastries on display. 

Kaleb calls over a lady wearing a beige apron with apricots on it, he points towards a certain pastry. Meanwhile his companion tries to find himself as he slowly breathes. ""Is it about that job you got?"" Kaleb assumes, remembering the time he mentioned a freelance offer he got through a website. ""No, not really."" He looked down to the floor before looking at Kaleb, who was just handed a brown paper bag, he pulled out a donut hole dusted in sugar. ""Then what is it?"" He asked, stuffing the donut hole into his mouth. ""Nothing would change if I were to tell you?"" The man hesitantly asked, they both leave the bakery and tread back on the road. Kaleb, confused by the man's question. 

""Depends."" Kaleb responds, Kaleb's always been the curious one of the two, although he's quite stubborn about certain things. His friend remembers as he hears this response from him, the two continue on their way. The man lost in thought as he walked for a couple minutes. ""So? What is it?"" Kaleb persists, curious about what his friend has to say. ""Take a left."" He directed, they swerved to an intersection, reaching a street of houses full of mute colors. Kaleb looked around, a bit curious to their surroundings as the other man looked down to the ground, throat dry as he walked to a small black gate, ""this is it"" he introduced, opening the small gate as they entered the humble establishment.

The two of them were greeted by warm orange lights, potted plants and one long wood bench were set aside near the main counter. They noticed the grills surrounding the open window, natural overgrowth wrapped around. “You still haven’t told me about-” Kaleb tried opening the conversation once again, his friend ignoring his curiosity. 

""So, drinks?"" 

""Do they have lattes?"" 

""Course they do."" 

""Vanilla then."" Kaleb decided, rolling up his sleeves just a bit, letting his arms breathe, his friend turned for a split second at Kaleb, noticing before he turned to look at the menu, text written with white chalk on a green chalkboard, prices displayed on the side. A bit too expensive he thought to himself, however for Kaleb. It was worth spending a bit more. He relayed the order to the woman sitting down, checking the prices on a piece of paper she had in one hand, while the other took down the order on a blue record book. They exchanged a smile while he turned to see Kaleb sitting down on a small bench a few steps away from him. “This is the first time I’ve seen you bring someone, is something big happening?” The barista inquired, remembering the countless times she’s seen him around. 

“Not yet..” The barista smirked at his reply as she received the crisp bill he handed over. The man left, the woman grabbing a bag of coffee beans from the counter. The man walked over to where his friend was, he sat on the bench adjacent to Kaleb, they didn't talk for a few minutes as Kaleb was busy on his phone. The man’s breaths heavy as he tries composing himself and thinking deeply about what to say next. “I swear if the rolls aren’t good.” Kaleb jokingly warned his friend. They exchanged a small laugh, the man looked at Kaleb, now just noticing the glimmer in his hazelnut eyes. “You were saying?” Kaleb inquired, his friend a bit confused, “Back at the bakery, you were talking about something, yeah?” He clarified to his friend. His face shot up, remembering what he wanted to say, he cleared his throat. “I was?” He jokingly retorted. “Dan, come on. You’re killing me here.” Kaleb pushed, wanting to find out what his friend had to say. 

“There’s something that’s been bothering me.” Dan revealed, Kaleb responded with a sound. “Well, I wasn’t going to mention it but, I feel like it was important you of all people should know,” Dan opened up, Kaleb scooted closer to his friend, “Know about what?” He concerned himself, Dan then looked him in the eyes, his face looked flustered. Kaleb’s face started glowing a light shade of pink. “Kaleb…” 

“I finally got myself a date with this girl I met at work.” Dan said with a soft happy tone. Words couldn’t escape Dan’s mouth as he started talking about the details more. Kaleb’s glow slowly vanished, listening ever so intently to his friend. Lips pursed as he nodded each time Dan talked. 

His chest heavy as he internalized himself, his fantasy shattered with a void of silence, his calm composure started to crumble, forcing a smile on his face. 

Dan laughed as he finished whatever he was talking about. Kaleb didn’t listen even though his face said otherwise. “What did you think I was going to say?”

I have been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years and see a future with him. We are both in our 20s. I do my best to be patient and understanding with everything he is going through, but I know that I can never truly understand how he feels. He can get irritated quickly and I know my high energy can sometimes be draining for him. 

He has been formally diagnosed and has done multiple MSLTs. He’s tried various medications to help him sleep before bed and different daytime medications to help him be more energized throughout the day. So far, no combo has seemed to make a big difference. He has stopped drinking excessive amounts of caffeine for his heart health, but still has a cup of coffee in the morning. 

Do you guys have any advice or recommendations on how I can show up as a better partner? Or any recommendations on what has worked for you to deal with daytime sleepiness, getting more restful sleep at night, and medications that were the most helpful? 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated, both for what I can do and what has worked for you personally while dealing with IH. I love him so much and I want to do anything and everything I can to help him. Thank you all in advance!

“Hello Darkness, my old friend…”

The alarm sounded even less enthusiastic playing the alarm than I was about hearing the cover of the classic song. With my eyes still closed I groggily tried to turn it off with one hand while reaching for my thyroid pills with the other, and ended up missing both. I swore as I reluctantly parted my eyelids to find the alarm button before getting out of the warm bed to find wherever I had left those damn pills. I needed to take them now at this ungodly hour so I could eat my breakfast at a reasonable time. Stupid fucking hypothyroidism. 

At least I hadn’t woken up my husband, ShepHeard. It was a gamble whether he would have gotten up early to take care of the farm animals or not on any given day, but his side of the bed was empty on this occasion. He had probably started with the chickens first, collecting the eggs and refilling their food before heading to milk the cows. The chickens were a bunch of gossipy little bitches, and ShepHeard hated listening to them squabble about the same few topics every day. It was always about mealworms and eggs, only broken up by the occasional snake sighting near the coop. He much preferred the company of the dairy cows, who he claimed “had their shit figured out” and would chit chat with them for hours if I didn’t bug him out of it. At least this meant I had fresh eggs and milk every morning for breakfast, even if my husband preferred using his super power to talk with animals instead of talking to his wife. 

 I finally found the medicine bottle underneath the nightstand. I must have knocked it to the floor in the night, or maybe the cat had batted it down like the little asshole he was. That wasn’t even just my disdain speaking, ShepHeard had confirmed that our orange tabby was an asshole that constantly bitched about the quality of his food. He said at one point that he preferred the mice and rats that he caught around the farm over the fanciest of feasts we served, and I had never really gotten over that. 

I downed the pill with some of the coppery tasting well water and made a mental note to get our groundwater tested again. Since I was already out of bed, I threw on a bathrobe and made my way outside, trying to calculate which animals my husband would likely be tending to at this time. I tried to touch the wet grass as little as possible as I tip-toed my way to the chicken coop, and failed miserably as I arrived with wet feet and a damp bottom edge of the bathrobe. I was so engrossed in the discomfort of the morning dew that I didn’t initially realize the chickens were being unusually quiet. They usually greeted me with a chorus of interested ‘bawk’s and ShepHeard with a flurry of gossip about mealworms. Instead, I found them all huddled together in one corner of the coop, with their daily eggs abandoned in the nesting box. 
Odd. ShepHeard usually collected the eggs first thing, stamping the shells with the date before putting them in the basket by the coffee machine in the kitchen. Natural unwashed eggs could keep on the shelf for a few months, but it was always good to know which of the non-white eggs were in danger of turning into stinky time bombs. 

“Where’s ShepHeard?” I asked the yardbirds. One of the satin silky mixes answered me with a single, frightened “bawk”. God, I wished I could just learn ShepHeard’s powers, instead of feeling like the only one left out of the group chat. Every other creature living here could talk to each other except for me. Maybe I could convince him to carry a radio on him at all times, so he could translate these farm animal squeaks and squawks into english for me. 

The next natural place to check would be the barn, but he wouldn’t have skipped the coop to chit chat with a cow. Or would he? Maybe he paid the cows a social visit before starting the work day. Whatever. I made the trek towards the barn, abandoning all efforts to keep my feet and bathrobe dry. 

The barn door was open, but I didn’t see any movement within. That was strange, it was definitely closed when I went to bed last night, and ShepHeard wouldn’t leave his gossip girls vulnerable like this. 

I jumped when a soft “moo” sounded just behind me. One of the cows had snuck up behind me, and now was trying to nudge my hand for some pets. I reached out to comply, but the cow took a step out of hand patting range. 

“What's wrong?” I asked the cow. I wasn’t expecting a verbal reply, but the cow refused to elaborate anyways. It just stared at me with those big brown eyes, begging me for… something. Was I reading into this too much? “Why are you out here? Y’all are supposed to be grazing in field 6, aren’t you?” 

The cow refused to explain in a way I could understand. “Moo”, it softly cooed, taking another step back and glancing at the barn before laying her sad brown eyes on me once more. 

Something felt wrong here. I took off on a brisk walk to the barn, hoping to find either my husband or a lead to get the cow back into its pen. The cow followed me of its own accord, mooing louder and louder as we neared the open door. It was the only sound I heard on the entire damn farm. 

“ShepHeard?” I called out. “Shep, you in there?” There was no response. I rounded the corner and stepped inside the dark barn, searching along the wall for the light switch. Was it on this wall or the far one? It must be on the other, since I wasn’t finding it on this side. I tried to gently tiptoe through the straw, thankful that it wasn’t wet like the grass outside. My thanks were short lived, however, as I stepped into a warm damp spot. Was this cow piss? The day was getting worse by the minute. 

I finally found the light switch and flipped it on. There was a hand towel on a nail nearby, which I grabbed to wipe the cow pee off my bare foot. It came back bloody. 

“Shep? I think one of the cows has a bladder problem, there’s so much blood in its urine” I said as I glanced back through the barn. I traced my own bloody footprint back through the hay, trying to find which poor cow was leaving puddles of blood outside their pen.

My blood froze. A human sized lump lay in the darkened pile of tainted hay. “Shep?” I said weakly, barely above a whisper as the word struggled out. “Shep? Honey?”

1jva78g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jva78g/this_is_all_i_need_ebook_available_in_wattpad/,This is all I need (e-book available in wattpad),"Thomas Whitmore’s days began at 5:30 AM, his alarm clock blaring like a factory whistle. By 6:00 AM, he was in his tailored suit, gulping coffee as he scanned stock reports on his tablet. His wife, Sara, shuffled into the kitchen of their modest Brooklyn apartment, her robe cinched tight. “You’ll make Jason’s game tonight?” she asked, her voice tinged with hope. Thomas hesitated. “The merger’s hitting a snag. I’ll try.” He kissed her forehead, the scent of her jasmine shampoo drowned out by his cologne.  

At 8:00 AM, Thomas arrived at Sterling Financial, greeted by the sterile hum of the office. His boss, Mr. Hammer, a wiry man with a permanent frown, barked about deadlines. Thomas buried himself in spreadsheets, his pocket watch—a gift from Sara on their wedding day—ticking in his breast pocket.  

**Chapter 2: The Unseen Cracks**  
Sara Whitmore stood at the kitchen window, watching rain streak the glass. Jason’s soccer game would be cancelled, but the disappointment lingered. At 14,Jason had stopped asking his dad to attend matches. Nora, 8, sat at the table, sketching a family portrait with crayons—his father’s figure smudged. “He’s working,” Sara said softly, tousling Nora’s hair. “For us.”  

That afternoon, Sara visited Wilson’s Groceries. Mrs. Wilson, the shopkeeper with kind eyes, noticed her hollow stare. “You look tired, dear.” Sara forced a smile. “Just busy.” Mrs. Wilson handed her a box of chamomile tea. “For the soul,” she winked.  

Thomas missed Nora’s art show. Again. That night, Sara confronted him, her voice trembling. “The kids need you. I need you.” Thomas ran a hand through his greying hair. “You think I like this? The loans, the bills—if I stop, we lose everything.” The argument ended in silence, the chasm between them widening.  

The next morning, Thomas hailed a taxi. The driver, an older man with a photo of his granddaughter on the dash, chuckled. “You remind me of my son—always working. Now, he’s rich, but his kids don’t know him.” Thomas frowned, staring at the pocket watch.  

At work, Mr. Hammer called Thomas into his office. “Your numbers are slipping. Take a day off. You look like hell.” Thomas bristled but complied. On the walk home, he passed a park, children laughing. He froze—Jason was there, kicking a soccer ball alone. He didn’t see him.  

That night, Sara found Thomas at Nora’s bedside, listening to his daughter’s rambling story about a robot. Nora’s eyes lit up. “Dad! You’re here!” Thomas’s throat tightened.  

Days later, Thomas collapsed at work, stress-induced exhaustion. In the hospital, Sara clutched his hand, tears streaming. “We’d rather have you than a bigger house.” Jason and Nora huddled close, their fear palpable.  

Mr. Hammer visited, uncharacteristically gentle. “I did this same dance. Lost my marriage. Don’t be me, Tom.”  
  
Recovery was slow. Thomas negotiated reduced hours, trading his corner office for a cubicle. Sundays became sacred—pancake breakfasts, muddy soccer games, Nora’s art projects plastered on the fridge.  

At Wilson’s, Sara smiled genuinely now. Mrs. Wilson nodded, “Tea worked, eh?”  Years later, Thomas sat at Jason’s college graduation, Nora—now a teen—snapping photos. The pocket watch still ticked, a reminder of time’s fragility. Sara squeezed her hand. They’d learned: happiness wasn’t in the grind, but the moments between the ticks.
  
Hope you guys understood the story....

1. I am putting together a performance review and a letter from the board laying out the weekend activities and tying it all together (essentially the birthday card).
2. I had blue balloons printed with his face on it, Severance style.
3. I have a large envelope with gift #1, which is an ORTBO. I booked us a little mini retreat center. This will have the details of the weekend specified such as dates and activities.
4. I have a blue box with a crystal cube laser engraved picture of us like the one on Mark’s desk (present #2).

I want to have one more gift possibly in a gift bag with something else. I want it to be useful though. I was thinking possibly a severance mug and candle with a note that could be hand written with “your outie loves scented candles and your outie loves coffee.”

I also am considering making a platter of deviled eggs and waffles.

1jva5u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1jva5u8/these_2_fundraising_hacks_helped_me_meet_100s_of/,"These 2 Fundraising ""Hacks"" Helped me meet 100s of Investors (I will not promote)","Most Founders know zero Investors.

I tell every Founder that will listen when it comes to Fundraising that there are 2 ""hacks"" that helped me more than anything when I was trying to raise VC for my last 3 companies.

*Quick Backstory - I moved to LA and didn't know a single investor. So I built a system to strategically get connected and then grew it very quickly to hundreds of investors I met in person.*

**Hack 1 - Start with Funded Founders**

We all want those vaunted ""warm connections"" to investors, but no one really knows how to get enough of them to matter.  The answer is simple - talk to funded Founders, even if you don't know them yet.  Especially those that have investors that you'd like to have as well (Crunchbase has most of this info btw)

Two reasons for this -

1. Founders are amazingly cool, and we love to help each other, so we're way more open to helping strangers who happen to be Founders.  So go talk to some strangers (Founders).
2. Founders can tell you exactly who NOT to talk to, and why, because they just went through this whole gauntlet.  But if they like you, they will often be willing to make a warm intro to their investors.

*My experience* \- I didn't know a single person, so I cold emailed Jason Nazar (had just started DocStoc at the time, sold it later) and said ""Hey I don't know you, you don't know me, but we're both Founders, can we get a coffee and talk shop?""  It turned out Jason had just taken a bunch of capital (I didn't even know this) and immediately made introductions to a bunch of investors who ended up funding my deal.  He's a goddamn Startup National Treasure btw ;)  But all it took was one person to get the ball rolling.

**Hack 2 - Every Investor is a Node for more Investors**

Every investor is a potential node to LOTS of other investors *regardless of whether or not they invest.*  Your mileage may vary, but I found most investors were willing to point me toward other investors they knew because that's how they operate.  It's part chivalry and part ego (in a good way) where they want to show that they can help.

Ask every single investor, unless the meeting just went horrifically wrong, whether they would recommend any other investors to talk to, and if so, if they would be open to an introduction.  BTW if they say no, I can almost guarantee they aren't interested in investing!  But you're going to get a lot more ""Yes"" folks I'd suspect than you imagine, and most people don't even think to ask.

My experience - I started out with just a few investors who were local to LA at the time, but they each introduced me to 1 or 2 of their friends, and I was adamant about asking for more connections (I was cool about it, but I always asked) and they consistently obliged.  In the end I got first hand introductions to hundreds of investors (most of Sand Hill Road) simply by networking through those nodes, in a very short period of time.

... I hope this helps a few of you, but I'd also like to hear if any of you have a similar strategy that's worked well for you that I can share with my fellow Founders.

**Does anyone else have any hacks that I can share?**

I should have left it there but foolishly asked if there was any reason as to why i.e. a physical thing or etc. to which he said  ""I want someone who has more experience and physical.

The living room was anything but peaceful. The chaos was almost a daily routine, though the topics of debate always had one thing in common: they were completely, utterly absurd.

Today was no different. Korvo, Yumyulack, Jesse, and Terry were all gathered in the living room, arguing about something so trivial it could only exist in their strange world of nonsensical debates. The room itself was an eclectic mix of clutter: half-eaten snacks on the coffee table, discarded alien tech scattered across the floor, and the faint hum of the Pupa somewhere in the background, possibly involved in some kind of *Pupa-like* activity.

Yumyulack, ever the perfectionist, was pacing back and forth in front of the couch, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. His face was contorted with frustration, and his eyes were locked onto his sister, Jesse, who was lazily sprawled on the couch, chewing on a piece of candy.

“You can’t just eat candy when it’s still warm!” Yumyulack blurted, his voice almost pleading. “It’s scientifically proven that candy should cool down before consumption!”

Jesse, clearly not caring about the science behind candy, shrugged nonchalantly. “It’s candy, Yumyulack. It’s not going to change my life if I eat it warm. You’re overthinking this!”

“Oh, you’re not just ruining your taste buds,” Yumyulack snapped, “You’re *ruining the candy* itself! If you don’t let it cool down, it’s going to be all wrong!”

Jesse rolled her eyes, unbothered. “Yumyulack, I’m just eating it. It’s not that deep.”

Just as the tension reached its peak, Korvo, who had been sitting at the kitchen table with a mug of what could only be described as *alien mystery liquid*, suddenly threw his hands up in exasperation. He had heard enough. He stormed over, his frustration evident in the way he stomped across the room.

“Enough!” he barked, standing over them with his arms crossed. “I can’t believe you’re actually arguing about *candy temperatures*. This is beyond stupid! We’ve got real problems—like, you know, *the fate of the universe*—and you’re wasting time on *candy physics*?”

Yumyulack turned on him immediately. “It’s not candy physics, Korvo! It’s *science*. Candy has a specific crystallization process, and if you eat it too warm, you ruin the texture and taste. Why can’t you understand that?”

Korvo groaned, rubbing his forehead. “You know what? I’m done with this whole conversation. There are far bigger issues at stake here. Why are there no candies shaped like *clouds*? I mean, come on! Think about it! *Cloud-shaped candy* could revolutionize everything! Why are we still stuck on the same old boring shapes?”

Jesse blinked at Korvo, her mouth hanging open in disbelief. “Cloud-shaped candy? Are you out of your mind?”

Korvo waved his hand dismissively. “It’s a *big idea*, Jesse. Imagine biting into a fluffy, cotton-like candy that actually looks like a cloud. It would change everything.”

“Yeah, *everything*,” Yumyulack muttered sarcastically, “It’ll change the world, Korvo. It’ll change everything.”

The room was growing more chaotic by the second, and as if on cue, Terry, who had been lounging lazily on the couch, sat up with a dramatic sigh. He rubbed his eyes, clearly not wanting to deal with the madness. But Terry wasn’t one to stay out of an argument for long.

“What if we had candy shaped like *toothbrushes*?” he suggested, totally out of the blue. “Like, why not? You could have a minty candy that *looked* like a toothbrush. It’s perfect, right?”

The three of them stared at Terry, their expressions a mix of confusion and disbelief.

“Are we seriously arguing about *shapes* of candy right now?” Jesse asked, her tone laced with exasperation.

Terry, unphased by the skepticism around him, nodded enthusiastically. “Yes! The world needs more creativity in candy shapes. Why not think outside the box—literally?”

“Alright, that’s it,” Yumyulack said, throwing his hands in the air, “You’re all insane. I’m done. There’s no reasoning with you people.”

The room went quiet for a moment. It felt like the argument had reached its peak—until Korvo broke the silence with his next thought.

“You know what? I think I’ve figured it out. The *real* issue is the fact that humans insist on walking everywhere. Why don’t we just build *throwing sidewalks* that *throw* you wherever you need to go? We could have *people-launching machines* to shoot you off to your destination. It would save so much time! Forget walking—let's just get thrown around!”

The room went absolutely silent.

Jesse, her jaw practically on the floor, was the first to speak. “Wait… *throwing sidewalks*? You want to build a sidewalk that throws people around like a *tomato*?”

“Exactly,” Korvo said, clearly proud of himself. “Just imagine the speed! You’d never have to walk again. You could be in *the next room* in seconds. It’s genius.”

Jesse blinked, not sure if she should laugh or scream. “Yeah, but do you know what happens when people fall from the sky? They land like squishy tomatoes. How is that even practical?”

Korvo raised an eyebrow, unfazed. “That’s a *minor detail*, Jesse. It’s about the efficiency of getting places faster.”

Yumyulack’s face contorted in disgust. “What’s the *point* of getting places faster if you’re going to land on your face like an overripe fruit? This is so dumb, I don’t even know where to begin.”

Terry, however, seemed entirely on board with the idea. “Hey, it could work. I mean, we could have *squishy landing zones* at the end. Like giant pillows that absorb the impact. It’s just a matter of designing it right!”

Jesse shook her head, exasperated. “Okay, now we’re talking about *launching* people and having them land on pillows? Why don’t we just go back to walking? This is getting out of hand.”

The entire room fell into silence again, the absurdity of the situation slowly settling in. After a few moments, Jesse broke the silence with a sarcastic grin.

“You know what? Fine. Let’s just wear *yellow sunflower dresses*—because *that* is the only solution to all of this. If we’re going to argue over nonsense, we might as well look cute while we do it.”

Yumyulack immediately picked up the thread, jumping in to argue. “You can’t just wear yellow sunflower dresses! It’s a violation of the natural order! *Men* are not meant to wear yellow sunflower dresses. That’s completely against the fabric of fashion!”

Korvo, not missing a beat, chimed in. “Well, if we’re being honest, men *should* wear yellow sunflower dresses. It would be a bold statement. It would change everything. People would respect the dress code—*finally*.”

The room fell into another ridiculous silence, each of them utterly wrapped up in yet another absurd argument, lost in the depths of their nonsensical debates.",1,1744216097.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

Aurora

The kitchen was suffocating, the air heavy with heat and the lingering smell of oil. Every movement I made sent a wave of pain through my body, a cruel reminder of the beating I had endured just the day before. My brother, Evan, had snapped because I hadn’t prepared dinner in time. His fists were as predictable as the sunrise, and the bruises he left were a part of my daily reality.

Physical pain had become something I could endure, but the emotional scars were harder to ignore. My family never let me forget the accident that had claimed my mother’s life. Their words were blades, slicing into me day after day. It’s your fault. If only you had listened. My childlike mischief, a game in the woods despite their warnings, had cost my mother her life. That guilt was the foundation of their anger—and the prison I couldn’t escape.

""Are you deaf, you stupid girl?!"" My dad’s voice ripped through the haze of my thoughts, dragging me back to the present. He grabbed a fistful of my hair and yanked hard, pulling me off balance.

“I’ve been calling you! What’s wrong with you?” His words were venomous, his grip relentless.

I struggled to pull away, but he shoved me so forcefully that my head collided with the wall. I crumpled to the floor, clutching the throbbing spot on my scalp. 

# The Cursed Alpha’s Human Mate: [Read Link](https://authors.xerfitf.com/index.php/2025/04/09/human-mate-of-the-doomed-alpha-1/1808/)

""You’re not just mute; you’re deaf too!"" he spat, glaring down at me.

I didn’t respond—I couldn’t. After my mother died, I lost my voice, and the doctor called it trauma-induced mutism. He said it might return with time, but years had passed, and I had long forgotten the sound of my own voice. It didn’t matter, though. My family never cared about my words.

“Get off the floor!” my dad barked. “The customers are waiting!”

I dragged myself upright, swallowing the lump in my throat. Tears burned behind my eyes, but I didn’t let them fall. Crying only made things worse. It made them crueler.

In the restaurant, the hum of conversation filled the air. It was strange to see so many customers; our reputation as a haven for loan sharks and troublemakers had scared most people away. My dad said the construction project across the street had brought in new faces. That meant more work for me.

I moved between tables, taking orders and delivering plates, my legs aching with every step. The bruises and burns on my skin screamed with each movement, but stopping wasn’t an option. My family didn’t care about exhaustion or pain—they only cared that I worked.

As the night dragged on, a small hope flickered when the last few customers left. But I knew better than to think I could rest. My dad and Evan always found a reason to punish me.

The door chimed, and my heart sank. Two men walked in and took a seat at a corner table. Their presence was striking, commanding even.

# The Cursed Alpha’s Human Mate: [Read Link](https://authors.xerfitf.com/index.php/2025/04/09/human-mate-of-the-doomed-alpha-1/1808/)

The first man was calm and collected, with gray eyes that seemed to see everything. His short black hair was neatly styled, and his sharp features gave him an air of quiet power. The second man was just as striking, though in a more intimidating way. His piercing blue eyes locked onto mine as soon as I looked up, sending a chill through me. His broad shoulders and confident stance made him seem larger than life. I quickly dropped my gaze and hurried away.

“Aurora!” My dad’s sharp hiss broke through my nerves pulling me from my thoughts. I stared back at him in confusion if he had said something.

“Didn’t you hear me? I said to get them iced coffee!” He growled through gritted teeth.

I rushed to the kitchen, my hands trembling as I poured the drinks. By the time I returned to their table, my entire body was shaking—whether from fear, exhaustion, or both, I wasn’t sure.

The blue-eyed man’s gaze followed my every move, making me clumsier with each step. When I reached the table, my hands betrayed me. One of the cups tipped over, spilling coffee across his pants. He shot to his feet with a curse, the tension in the room thick enough to suffocate me. His companion handed him a handkerchief, his expression unreadable.

I bowed down in an attempt to apologize. My dad rushed over, grabbing my arm hard enough to bruise. “I’m so sorry,” he said, his voice dripping with false concern. “My daughter can be clumsy, I apologize. Please let me make it up to you by replacing your spilled drink.”

# The Cursed Alpha’s Human Mate: [Read Link](https://authors.xerfitf.com/index.php/2025/04/09/human-mate-of-the-doomed-alpha-1/1808/)

The calm man waved it off. “No need. We were about to leave anyway.” My dad’s attempts to convince them to stay were ignored, and the men paid and left without a backward glance. The moment the door closed behind them, the mask of civility slipped from my dad’s face.

He flipped the sign to ‘Closed’ and turned to me, his eyes blazing with fury as he walked towards me. I knew I was in trouble. My heart was racing with fear as I held the tray tightly to my chest. I prayed silently for someone to save me. I didn't know how much more I could take, especially with the fresh wounds from yesterday and the dizziness from the fall. 

# The Cursed Alpha’s Human Mate: [Read Link](https://authors.xerfitf.com/index.php/2025/04/09/human-mate-of-the-doomed-alpha-1/1808/)

“You useless brat!” His hand flew out before I could react, the slap knocking me into the counter.

Pain flared in my ribs as he kicked me, and I curled into myself instinctively. “You want to embarrass me in front of the customers?” he spat, yanking me up by my hair. I tried to beg, but the words wouldn’t come. My heart raced as he ripped my shirt, leaving me in my sports bra, then threw me back to the cold floor.

“You’ll learn your place tonight!” he growled, pulling off his belt. I closed my eyes, bracing for the sting of leather, but it never came. Instead, I heard a loud crash.

I opened my eyes, blinking through tears to see my dad sprawled on the floor. Standing over him was the blue-eyed man, his expression dark and dangerous. His companion leaned against the doorframe, his gray eyes cool but sharp as they flicked to me.

Relief washed over me, but the adrenaline and pain were too much. My vision blurred, and the world faded to black.

I've tried a lot of different nootropics and this is my favorite so far. The past two days I took one capsule with breakfast and another with lunch. It's pretty stimulating like almost drinking a 2nd cup of coffee.

I noticed that when talking to others while on it, my speech was flowing better and I just felt 10/10 and super energized. Not sure if this is due to the effects it has on BDNF, but it gave me a significant noticeable effect.

I wanted to also write about the negatives that I noticed incase this maybe helps someone. I noticed that it makes me feel super hungry all the time and was actually messing with my ability to fall asleep. The first night it messed with my sleep a bit, but it wasn't too bad. I was able to fall asleep fine after a certain point and the next day felt amazing taking it again.

The 2nd day I took my 2nd capsule a little later than the first day and it absolutely ruined my sleep. I felt great up until I was trying to fall asleep, and then the intense feeling of hunger came and it was pretty uncomfortable. It felt like my heart was racing and I got really hot/irritated. Pretty much spent the whole night rolling around unable to sleep and felt awful the next day.

I'm not sure if this was from the MAOI effects and maybe 2 capsules is just too much for me (I'm pretty lightweight when it comes to this stuff). Would love to hear others experiences as the effects during the daytime are amazing.

Nine days ago, I begged for non-cringe LD mom gifts. Three days ago, I updated y’all about gambling on those “Totwoo bracelets” that blink when you miss each other.

WELL. Mom’s fully weaponized it now. Here’s the chaos:

New Developments (Good & Unhinged):

Win: She invented a “glow code”:

1 pulse = “Call me”

2 pulses = “Check your email”

5 rapid pulses = “I bought new plants … send money.”



Fail: She “lit me up” during my work presentation. Boss thought my wrist was possessed.

Chaos: Forgot to charge it once. Got a 3AM text: “Is this thing broken or are you DEAD?”



Unexpected Wins:

Gardening MVP: Survived mud, rain, and her “testing” if it’s actually waterproof (it is).

Step Counter Rivalry: She’s at 15k steps/day. I’m losing. Send help.

Family Gossip: My aunt now wants one “to harass your uncle.”



Would I Buy It Again?

For $150? Still a maybe:

Pro: She’s obsessed. “It’s like a Tamagotchi, but you’re the pet.”

Con: She keeps asking when it’ll track her tomato plants.

1jv9s32,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/1jv9s32/a_rocket_buildinglaunching_game_like/,A rocket building/launching game like simplerockets or kerbal space program but in real time!,"An engineering game like KSP or Juno: New Origins where you give directions to the game and the game executes them in real time. e.g. want to assemble a new rocket with 50 different pieces. 3 days - real time. Want to fill a tank on a new craft with fuel. 2 hours - real time. Want to recover a vessel from a splash landing. 8 hours - real time.

But here is the twist: it's a multiplayer/coop game and having more friends speeds up the times. Many hands make light work. Have a buddy join you then refueling that tank is 1 hour instead of two. Have three friends then it's now 30 minutes. Build an organisation of engineers and scientists and things that would take days can be reduced to hours.

It would kind of be a point-and-click turn-based type thing where people need to strategise and think about the next move. Build out a blue print? Manufacture parts? Refill or drain that tank? Add some extra solid-fuel boosters? Everything will take time so mistakes matter. The rocket is controlled by auto-pilot scripts so someone has to do those and they need to be right first time. Mistakes hurt. You will queue up a series of actions, divide them amongst your mates so things can happen in parallel or simply faster concentrated efforts. Everyone will see the real-time investment. You debate. You double check your math. You debate some more. You tune. You change the work load between yourselves. You reduce the real-time cost. Then you ""submit"" your actions. You then make a coffee and eat some pizza while the timer counts down and the game starts to action your queue.

You might return 15 minutes later. Or two hours. Or the next day. When the queue is done or even partially done you check the math. You check the weight-thrust ratios. You discuss and debate with your friends. Did we make the right call? Is the ship ready to launch? Do we need another day to tune something?

Your huddle of friends are convinced the craft is ready so watch the flight live or a video replay at some later date.

Yes, it's a grind, but it encourages collaboration and team work. You need to think about the science and the math. You need to debate orbital mechanics because mistakes can be recovered but they cost real time and you may not discover those mistakes until your 20 seconds above the launch pad.

Get more friends. Build an organisation. Assign engineers and scientists and auto-pilot scripts. Get production and assembly times down to minutes and the sense of reaching orbit is a genuine feeling of accomplishment. Learn the math and the lingo. Spot and debate design flaws before it's too late.

Compete against other organisations that have to battle the same time-cost. Watch them struggle with mistakes and crashed craft and watch them wish they spent the extra few hours that you used to build in redundant systems.

Of course, for the single player, you can have difficulty options that reduce hours/days down to seconds/minutes, but at that point - just go play KSP or Juno.  :)

I'm in my 30's and living with my mother and grandmother. Family is toxic and I now know so emotionally abusive to me as a child and adult including bullying and enmeshment and well, a whole list that I'm grappling with and feeling overwhelmed with now I'm listing it all out to hopefully take to a therapist.

  
I'm disabled, mental and physical health issues. My mum is overweight and grandmother is also disabled (recently care needs increased a bit, but she is independently mobile and also independent with toilet needs)

  
Mother is now a hermit, hasn't left the house since December. I ask her to speak to a dr or therapist, she dismisses is. I've told her to pop out and take a break and she says she doesn't want to. I've suggested the carers coffee morning, she asked what she'd want to speak to those people for. She's complaining constantly about caring, but then again refuses any help I've suggested, when I said I'd call in support she started a huge argument.

  
Anyway, I went away for a couple of days to do something I wanted to. I obviously had to call all the time to tell them when I was leaving the hotel, when I got back, when I left the hotel to walk to the place and call when I arrived. I did it as usual and my grandmother wanted to know as she wasn't well and worries.

  
When I came back I said that I did it, but going forward I would like to set some boundaries. I'll call but maybe once a day and not all the time and so I have some time for a real break.

Well, it was like I'd asked for something extreme. I then said I wasn't arguing, I just don't want this all the time. I was told I always 'start'. I said it's an issue we have communicating, my mother said there is no issue communicating, it's when I start arguing. Whenever I disagree or say something she doesn't like/agree with it kicks off a huge argument that somehow I started.

  
Now after a huge argument where she said her life is hell (but won't do a thing to change it or get help) she's being passive aggressive and muttering about me.

I know there are huge enmeshment issues, when I was at school I wasn't ever allowed on class trips unless she could be a chaperone and it was seen as me having a perfect mum. At home though she was asking me why I couldn't be more like my friends or berating me when I performed badly (I was a child performer) and saying everyone was laughing at me. One time made me cry all the way home from a 100 mile journey when I'd messed up a routine when I'd gone with the flu. Also my grandfather had just died tragically that September (this was November) and it was traumatic for me, I got OCD when he was in hospital for cancer treatment.

Our family is full of sociopaths and narcs, great aunts and stuff that filtered in. For example, one of my aunts used to pitch me against her favoured niece as a child and would be like, I'll get you two sweets, oh don't worry, I'll see you later K, I'll just bring them to your house, leaving me in the dark. Also getting extravagant gifts for her and me nothing, which then maed my mother sob when we'd come home and she'd ask why she didn't like me as much as her.  


I can't do this anymore, but I can't afford to move and honestly don't have the energy or the physical fitness. I have no real support system that could help me if I move away, just a therapist and a few distant friends. But I can't do it anymore. It's all getting more and more toxic to the point that she attacks me about sitting outside in the garden (something she is free to do but won't).

  
I don't know what to do. I'm so stuck and I'm desperate for a life of my own, but this is my family, I of course love them and they've always been there for me and they're all I have.

  
Nothing can be worked through, if I bring any of this up it starts huge arguments and all ""why are you starting now? why today? oh, you had it so hard"" also a lot of ""it's only because...""

  
Also, it's not always bad, it's fine when it's good and there have been good times. I fear I've made her out to be a monster, but she's not, she does love me.

  
Sorry, I've rambled, I'm just so stuck.
