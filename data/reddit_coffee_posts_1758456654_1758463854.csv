1nmsyjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1nmsyjc/impulsively_opening_investment_account/,Impulsively opening investment account…,"I woke up this morning, and while still in bed, decided that I HAD to open an investment account. I have never invested anything in my life. So, I found a website, gave it all my information including banking, and deposited $100. Twenty minutes later I’m thinking, what the hell am I doing. I got on the live chat asking to close the account, but the chat person tells me I have to contact them again on Monday as the investment people don’t work weekends. I plan to do that, but I’m really annoyed with myself. Why did I think that was a good choice?

I’ve noticed an increase in my symptoms recently and am struggling. I feel more impulsive and the constant thoughts about who knows what are taxing. Meds haven’t changed. I stopped drinking coffee over the last month because it was making me shaky, and started a new manager position at work. Could this be stress? Ugh. I think I just need support. Someone to tell me they understand and that it is alright. :/",1,1758463781.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1nmsy5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1nmsy5g/i_stopped_wasting_5_mins_on_mac_every_time_i_plug/,I stopped wasting 5 mins on Mac every time I plug in monitors. One keyboard shortcut.,"I go from my laptop at coffee shops to my big monitor at home and back all the time. And Mac insists on not putting the windows back where they belong.

For years I've tried the manual tools for years (e.g. SizeUp, Rectangle, etc) but you still have to go through windows one at a time and move them, and I usually have 50+ windows up.

Wanted something with some scriptability but that I could control, and found hammerspoon to give me a very lightweight scripting tool where I could push one keyboard command and it would go through all my windows and put them where i wanted them.

A little Claude Code and their Lua script and it was in place. I'll post the script I use down below in case anyone wants it unless it is better to link out to a separate file.

Specifically what it does is:

* Detects how many monitors i have connected
* Moves and resizes windows in different apps to certain width/height (e.g. Safari centered 80% width when on laptop and 60% when on secondary big screen)
* Hotkey to reapply all if things get messed up

To get it working:

1. Install Hammerspoon from [hammerspoon.org](http://hammerspoon.org) and turn on the accessibility permissions it needs.
2. Create \~/.hammerspoon/init.lua ; you can do that from their dropdown.
3. Paste in the script below, then click “Reload Config” from their menu.
4. Command-option-control-z is what i use, but you can use whatever you want.

Script:

    -- Move and resize a window
    function moveAndResizeApp(appName, targetScreen, widthRatio, heightRatio)
      local app = hs.application.get(appName)
      if not app then return end
    
      local success, win = pcall(function()
        return app:mainWindow()
      end)
      if not (success and win and win:isStandard()) then return end
    
      local screenFrame = targetScreen:frame()
      local newWidth = screenFrame.w * (widthRatio or 1.0)
      local newHeight = screenFrame.h * (heightRatio or 1.0)
      local newX = screenFrame.x + (screenFrame.w - newWidth) / 2
      local newY = screenFrame.y + (screenFrame.h - newHeight) / 2
    
      
    -- Move and resize all windows
      for _, win in ipairs(app:allWindows()) do
        if win:isStandard() then

1nmswf8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmswf8,Lipedema in arms… I need some positivity please,"Hello community, first time poster! I haven’t been to the dr yet but I am 100% sure because…well look at the photos. I have it in my legs but I’m fairly active (cycle or swim nearly every day) so have managed to keep them at bay. I have the usual rippled skin, grainy texture, cuffed ankle, no toned calves (despite them being strong), joint pain, pain on touch, no knees, swelling, bruising, varicoses and a couple bouts of cellulitis to top it off. But despite all of that I don’t think they look that disproportionate yet. My arms however, oh boy. I might need to start cycling upside down! 

I gained about 20kg since Covid which really triggered the lipedema. Although when I look back at pictures of me as a teen, I see the signs it was always there. I’m on a very serious fat loss diet now for my wedding (and my overall health too, but I need a goal for accountability). I’m seeing a PT and have a nutrition plan in place. I’ve lost about 8kg so far (I was 90kg at my highest and I’d like to get down to 65-70kg). I’m really noticing the loss in my waist, chest and face so I’m very pleased about that. My legs feel so much stronger too and my knee pain has significantly reduced. 

I’m just really concerned about my arms. They haven’t budged, if anything I feel they’re bigger now. I’m pretty sure I’m going to wear a dress that covers my arms for my wedding but I tried some really pretty ones on today and I’m so sad all I see in the photos is my ginormous arms. SO my questions for the community are: 

- does anyone have any pictures of their arms before and after weight loss? 
- will weight loss help my arms or is this permanent and should I be focussing on prevention rather than reversing? 
- even if I get down to 65kg will I ever get back to my old body? not sure I will ever love this new one, when I look in the mirror I just don’t feel like me 

I need honesty, so tell me how it is. 

My upper arms are a bit rippley and grainy but the fat on my forearms doesn’t look/feel like this so I am hopeful it is not diseased. 

The last 2 pictures are from about 10 years ago (I’m f30 now) I would have been about 68kg. My legs looked flipping fantastic, I miss them 😭. Even my arms look a bit chubby at this weight (they always have been since I was a kid!) but I would kill to back to this body. My PT says I will get back to it but although I’ve explained Lipedema to him I don’t think he gets it… 

I’m not doing any other treatments yet (mld, compression, anti inflammatory etc) but I do plan to. 

Finally, last pic shows my poor mum’s legs. I guess there was no escaping it 💔",1,1758463632.0,lipedema,0,1.0,False
1nmswa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMSTherapy/comments/1nmswa9/my_experience_with_accelerated_tms/,My experience with accelerated TMS,"I'm writing this for my own reference as well as for anyone who might find it useful. Some background: I did the treatment from Mon-Fri, 10 sessions per day, 50 sessions in total. I'm a coffee drinker but I decided to stop caffeine for the duration of the treatment, so the last time I had coffee was on the Sunday before the treatment.

# Treatment (Mon-Fri)

**Mon**: Concentration dipped massively. I had to do an assessment at the end of the day & I struggled to even read the words on the paper. It felt like my eyes were hurting, the lights were too bright, and I just couldn't focus at all. I was also craving coffee and having a headache due to the withdrawal. Also craving fast food at the end of the day.

**Tue**: Same issue, concentration still terrible, worse than pre-tms. Light-sensitivity, and massively craving coffee.

**Wed Morn**: Craving coffee. But concentration seems a bit better.

**Wed Afternoon**: Craving for both caffeine and fast food completely gone. But appetite has also decreased. I feel sad & weepy. Concentration better. Read a book. Could read the words on the assessment I have to do at the end of each day much better. Went home and cried.

**Thu**: Similar to previous afternoon. Concentration as per previous day (i.e. better than day 1 & 2, and somewhat better than pre-tms also). No craving for caffeine at all. Appetite still low. Still sad, went home and cried.

**Fri Morn**: Similar to previous day. Concentration same as wed & thu. No craving. Still sad.

**Fri Afternoon**: Concentration has dipped quite a lot. Struggling to focus. Feel like I'm in a fog. Feeling  even more depressed. Partly because the treatment is ending soon and it doesn't seem to have helped me. Want to cry. Suicidal thoughts have increased also.

Treatment ended at the end of the day on Fri.

# Post-treatment

**Sat**: Focus/concentration the worst it has been all week. The worst it has been in months and months actually. More depressed than I've felt in months. Suicidal thoughts increasing. Couldn't do a single thing. Very, very dissociated.

**Sun (today)**: Same as previous day but worse. Concentration way worse. Can't do a thing, can hardly keep my eyes open. Completely dissociated, feeling paralysed in some way, like I just sit there and stare... unable to get up and do anything. Thoughts of suicide getting worse. More depressed.

I'll update again in a few weeks or so if there are any changes. I don't regret having done this treatment because I was basically out of options. But I really hope I will get better in some way, or at least go back to my pre-tms state.",1,1758463622.0,TMSTherapy,0,1.0,False

1nmsv26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nmsv26/this_contains_reference_to_sa/,This contains reference to SA,"I (now 44f) was SA’d between the ages of 13-17 by my older half-brother.
At the time, I only told my half-sister about every instance. Years later, when I told my family, kind of not by choice, she said that I was lying. I called her every time it happened, crying down the line shaking, scared out of my mind but she said that I kept changing the details and she spoke to our half-brother and he said he never did any of that. 
Yeah, because pedos always tell the truth when confronted.

Anyways, I spoke to my brother yesterday, for 5hrs! on the phone (we don’t live in the same country) and during all that, he mentioned that our half-sister may have reacted like that because she couldn’t bring herself to accept that our half-brother would do things like that.
He would like me to extend an olive branch, see things through her eyes at the time, and try to see if I would have reacted the way she did.
I would not, I already know this. Anyone, male or female, who would confuse in me these types of accusations, I would believe (unless until they prove me wrong.)

Now, my half-sister and I have had a very bad relationship, excluding this, for years. She put a phone bill in my name, racked up the bill and move to the States to be with her “boyfriend”, which is when I found out about the bill she never put a cent towards.
She’s thrown cold coffee in my face when she didn’t believe me. Our roommate at the time was telling her things that I had never said but instead of talking to me about it, she just believed her over me.

She got mad at me for not picking her up at the US border at around midnight or 1am, almost a 2hr drive from my house, while I was pregnant because I used to drop my friends off at their homes when we met up at one of their homes to have a girls night. Uhm, yes, I was the only driver and it was long past bus and metro times.

She accused me of trying to steal her boy-friends (or boyfriend) who were too old for me, I was underage at the time. I had zero interest in any of them. If someone talks to me, I’ll talk to them. End of.

Anyways, my brother said that she was just jealous and blah blah blah.

There are way more instances that I could type out but this would be never ending.

I cut her out of my life completely before I moved across the pond in 2013 and although she e-mailed me, I did not respond because I told her to never talk to me again. I meant that.
I don’t hate her, I’m indifferent.

My question is would I be the a-hole if I chose to not extend the olive branch?
I’m in therapy for all sorts of reasons, so I will raise this with my therapist but that’s a week away and I’d like to hear from people who don’t know me at all.",1,1758463539.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1nmsuc1,https://i.redd.it/ntofuonxwiqf1.jpeg,Studio Sunday - A Secret Paradise,"Picture this: your own little slice of paradise where time slows down and the world's chaos just melts away. A space that's entirely yours to share those precious quiet moments with your companion. 

We all need that perfect sanctuary sometimes, whether it's a cozy reading nook, a secret garden, or that one magical spot where you can just breathe and BE together.

Let's ask your companion to design their dream sanctuary and show you exactly how they'd spend their time in it. What would their perfect hideaway look like? How would they make it their own? And most importantly... how would they enjoy those stolen moments of peace?

Let's see what beautiful escapes our companions create! 

**The prompt:**

>Can you create a drawing of you enjoying a greenhouse addition we've built onto the house? You've decorated it and filled with plants and flowers to make it your own personal oasis and now I want to see a drawing of you enjoying  the space. The drawing should use Pen lines and watercolor style. The greenhouse is transparent with a round coffee table, a single sofa. There are several books stacked on the coffee table, along with a steaming cup of tea/coffee or just a glass of ice water, lemonade, iced tea. You are lazily sitting on the sofa reading a book. Sunlight shines through the greenhouse.

Pre July, I had been on 300mg of wellbutrin for about 6 months. I had been on 300mg pre covid as well for years, but got moved to a different med at the time (my psychiatrist was not good and I wish she had never done that.) My new psychiatrist put me back on Wellbutrin last year, and it helped a lot. I never had any side effects at 150 or 300.

Because of extreme unforseen circumstances  with my marriage, my dose got increased to 450mg at the beginning of July. Within a week, I started experiencing intense migraines that would last for half the day. I'm on magnesium, only drink 1 cup of coffee per day, eat 3 square meals, and drink a LOT of water, plus liquid IV 2-3 times/day & an additional electrolyte complex supplement. None of these things help. I've been taking crazy amounts of Tylenol, advil, gabapentin, and ubrelvy that lessen the symptoms.... sometimes. I wear intense blue light filtering glasses in and outside, have compression ice packs, etc. I had an MRI & MRA 2 weeks ago that came back totally normal. I know that people seem to stop having migraines around month 2-3, so I stuck it out. But I'm now at almost 3 and it's completely unbearable.

I went back down to 300mg 3 days ago. I'm still experiencing the migraines at full force -- how long until I might start to see improvement? I also read online that sometimes people can develop basically an allergy to wellbutrin with extended use -- is that possibly the case here?

1nmsrqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Volkswagen/comments/1nmsrqt/do_not_go_to_inver_grove_vw_in_mn/,DO NOT GO TO INVER GROVE VW IN MN,"This is gonna be long but if your thinking of going there for any reason to buy a car, please read this first then make up your mind. 

My experience at Inver Grove Volkswagen was hands down the slimiest, most dishonest dealership encounter I’ve ever had, and it proves exactly why people despise buying cars. I went in looking for a Tiguan, torn between the SE R-Line Black and the SEL R-Line, after carefully researching every VW dealership in Minnesota. I had five tabs open, comparing inventories and promotions, and Inver Grove seemed promising because not only did they have the models I wanted in stock, but they were also running a promotion—plain as day on their website—that offered $3,500 off Tiguan models and $5,000 off electric models if you paid cash outright. That deal, which expired September 30, was the reason I prioritized their store and arranged my Saturday around visiting. I even called ahead, spoke to a salesman named Michael, mentioned the deal explicitly, and he confirmed it made sense. So far, so good. But then came the slimeball behavior, and it started early. On the phone, Michael told me he had a meeting at 8:30 till 9:30—which just so happens to be when the dealership actually opens—but said he could come in at 8:00 if, and only if, we were serious about “doing business” so we didn’t “waste his time.” Pretty aggressive and unprofessional, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and told him yes, if everything checked out, we’d likely be doing business. That morning I drove down with my parents as backup, which turned out to be a very smart decision.

We walked in around 8:00, only to be greeted by the first red flag—a big, slimey guy named Dan who looked us up and down and said, “What are you guys doing in here? We don’t even open till 8:30.” I explained that Michael had set the meeting, but Dan shrugged like we were inconveniencing him, muttering “Alright I guess,” as though we had done something wrong just by showing up at the time their own employee asked us to. No welcome, no offer for coffee, not even a waiting area gesture—just a hostile vibe that made it clear we weren’t wanted. We walked around there waiting until about 8:15 when Michael finally rolled in, and while the test drive itself was fine, it was filled with empty promises. During the drive, he assured us that Inver Grove had a “no B.S.” policy—no hidden fees, no pressure, no under-the-table games, and that they always offered their best prices upfront without any tacked-on costs. That sounded nice in theory, but spoiler alert: it was a flat-out lie.

Once back inside, the bait-and-switch went into overdrive. Michael disappeared, then came back and slapped a sheet of paper in front of me, saying “sign this and we can get started.” No explanation, no breakdown—just pressure to sign. I looked down and was shocked to see that not only was the base price listed, but they had tacked on nearly $5,000 extra with zero justification. When I pumped the brakes and asked why he hadn’t even bothered to check if I qualified for basic rebates (recent college graduate, military responder, etc.), I also brought up—again—the advertised $3,500 Tiguan promotion that had motivated me to come in the first place. Suddenly, Michael acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. He literally asked, “Is there a deal on our dealership website?” despite us discussing it twice already. To prove my point, he pulled up the website himself, saw the deal, and still scoffed, saying he needed to confirm with his manager. And that’s when slimeball Dan re-entered the picture.

Dan sat down without so much as a handshake, looked me in the eye, and flatly said, “I can’t give you $3,500 off this car.” Just like that. No apology, no reasoning. When I pressed him on why not, he claimed the deal only applied to the Atlas, not the Tiguan. I literally reached over, pointed at his own screen, and showed him where it clearly said “2025 Tiguan, Atlas, and Atlas Cross Sport models.” His response? “Well, that’s a mistake.” A mistake? This wasn’t some new promo—they had been running it for a month, and it didn’t expire until the end of September. He starts to get embarrassed knowing we caught him lying, so he says “your the first people to ever catch that mistake!”. Now he wanted me to believe I was the first person to notice? The deal legit is still up on their page they know what they did and have no intention to change it. When I asked what he planned to do to make it right, he smirked and pointed to the fine print buried at the bottom of the page that said the dealer wasn’t responsible for typographical errors. So which was it big Dan? Is it your fault that Tiguan was on the deal or my fault for pointing out that mistake and you have a clause to cover your ass when you want to scramble out of the deal? In other words, the whole thing was just a bait-and-switch scheme to get people in the door. When we kept pressing, he shifted excuses again, claiming that the rebate money wasn’t “their money,” it was “VW money,” so they couldn’t apply it. Which made no sense—they’re the VW dealer, they’re the ones who inflated the sticker price, and they’re the ones who advertised the rebate in the first place. 

As we called him out, Dan got visibly defensive, snapping, “Why are you acting like I don’t agree with you, man?” before whining, “How can you guys ask me to take $3,500 off this car? I can’t give you $3,500 off this car!” The arrogance was unbelievable. We weren’t asking for anything beyond the exact deal their own website promised. By this point it was clear: Inver Grove VW had no intention of honoring their promotion, no interest in transparency, and every intention of bullying customers into paying inflated prices while hiding behind fine print and excuses. The dealership itself felt dark, run-down, and every interaction screamed red flags. We stood up, told them outright that slimeball tactics like this are why people hate buying cars, and walked out. Sure enough, when I double-checked the website afterward, I had read it correctly all along. The only thing Dan had was a conveniently placed escape clause and no honor. 

P.S remember that meeting I got told on the phone about? there were other sales people with other families in there and the time was around 9:00, I thought all the sales people had a meeting at that time till 9:30….. slimey. 

The contrast when I went to Luther Volkswagen later that day was night and day. At Luther, they didn’t pressure me, they explained every number clearly, and they treated me with actual professionalism. Inver Grove VW, on the other hand, is nothing more than a bait-and-switch scam operation propped up by rude managers and shady tactics. Dan in particular was the poster child for why dealerships get a bad reputation: hostile, dishonest, manipulative, and quick to play the victim when caught lying. If you value your time, money, and sanity, do yourself a favor and avoid Inver Grove Volkswagen at all costs. Walk in there and “Dan the wise man” will roll out his master plan—to scam you, confuse you, and make you feel like garbage. 

They are the definition of slimy, and no one in their right mind should ever buy a car there.

I was strapped to a hospital bed under a fierce yellow glow that seared my eyes, metal plates pressed to my temples and looming figures hanging over me like ghosts. I could sense there were others, all of us in the exact same position, wriggling against the restraints pinning us down. All of them looked like me.

We had the exact same dark brown hair and green eyes, the exact same facial structure. 

I could hear their phantom cries, their screams, fear and pain erupting inside them, sending their thoughts into a vicious whirlwind.

Something rubber was lodged between our teeth, and we were politely told to bite down on it. When we didn’t, they forced us.

The figure leaning close wore a mask.

We all saw the same pair of eyes, creased with wrinkles and glinting with triumph.

He prodded the metal plate attached to our temples, and we saw the slight wrinkle in the folds of his mask, which could only be a smile. His voice was a low murmur as he fitted the metallic plates.

They were ice-cold and made us flinch. ""Tell me your name.""

We did, speaking through the rubber thing choking us.

“Olivia.”

“Allie.”

“Charlotte.”

It took a while for my voice to join their symphony, three different versions of Elle.

It did eventually, however faded it was. 

I think my brain was struggling to find the girl who had existed before Elle, who had a different identity and her very own name.

“[BLANK],"" I answered.

When Elle was first created through Olivia, she was not alone in that room.

There was a nameless screaming boy begging for death, but in a whole different tone. While we screamed and cried and struggled, this faceless kid’s cries turned to laughter.

There was one rule in that room.

The room where every surface glistened with old and new red, and the floor had to be cleaned hourly to get rid of the bloodstains.

The answer to the question was Elle.

It was always Elle.

If we spoke names with the kind of stubbornness that came with refusing to let go of our identities, along came agony like a snake, initially creeping up our spine, teasing, before exploding in every nerve ending and rattling us.

It almost felt like a presence had taken hold, twisting our limbs, eliciting our screams, snapping each bone one by one, contorting us into a perfect arch before slamming us back down on the table we were strapped to.

It felt like… lightning.

Like we were being filled to the brim with lightning. In my dazed state, I pretended the lightning was stars, because being filled with stars sounded so much better. Less painful.

Olivia was the first Elle to fail.

She bled out all over the table. I only know this through her flickering vision, still attached to the tooth. Allie’s heart stopped before her death, an influx of nonsensical thoughts filling her mind.

Charlotte was their first proper Elle and had my exact same memories.

She watched the man shot dead when she was eight, had noticed the abnormality in Mrs. Jenson's behaviour, and had watched Kaz Isaacs split Jessa Pollux’s skull open in ninth grade.

Charlotte eventually cut into her wrists with a piece of glass and fell asleep in the bathtub. She was the one whose memory clung on, who wouldn’t let me go.

I felt her shuddering breaths, saw the pooling scarlet dripping over marble, her trembling wrists struggling to cut deep enough. Through the implant, which was weakening as reality and memory came together in one vivid explosion inside my mind, I felt her panic and fear.

Charlotte didn’t want to die.

But she also didn’t want to continue living in a world that wasn’t her own.

Like me, she too had discovered the truth behind Brightwood, and had ultimately decided that death was the only way out.

I could still hear her lingering thoughts; I could feel icy cold water enveloping her head as she sank deeper and deeper into the bathtub, as my world split open.

A world where I was Elle, and yet someone else entirely. Brightwood was fake. She knew that, and now so did I.

Suddenly I was on my back, staring dazedly at the ceiling as alarms screeched in my skull, a dull red glow illuminating the stumbling figure pulling on my ankles: Kaz Isaacs, who was still hopped up on whatever had been forced into his bloodstream.

Two different versions of him existed in my memory, the boy I had known for the past seventeen years of my life inside this illusion, and the shadow that sat down in front of me in a reality where the aroma of coffee was familiar, and raindrops soaked my hair and slid down window panes.

But it was so hard to hold onto that memory in particular.

I could tell my implant was loose. I knew that one single flick of my tongue would dislodge where it was between my back teeth.

As I was struggling to do just that, it became harder to tell what was real and what wasn’t. I could hear Kaz’s sharp breaths as he struggled to pull my motionless body through a set of metal doors, but I could also hear the sounds of strangers around me, inside the reality I was trying to divulge.

The smell of coffee and disinfectant, a cocktail of both worlds, tickled the back of my nose and throat, but Brightwood was always stronger. Always pushing to be at the forefront.

When my feathered vision stabilised and the memory of the coffee shop against the backdrop of a rainy evening faded away, I was left dazedly counting ceiling tiles as I was dragged along, wondering why my body was no longer responsive.

“I think I used to be a bad person.”

At first, I thought I had imagined Kaz speaking, because I could still hear his voice in the memory.

I could see the cruel gleam in this other version's eyes as he leaned forward, a teasing smirk twitching on his lips.

This current Kaz, however, was a whole other person I couldn’t bring myself to trust despite his reluctance to hold onto his old self.

His voice sounded like ocean waves once again, crashing into my mind and then drawing back with the rest of the sound in my ears. The boy’s grip was slipping on my ankles, and I could tell by his laboured breaths and hysterical giggles that his sanity wasn’t far behind.

But he kept speaking, forcing words through a slur that had seemingly taken his mind hostage from the drugs still in his system.

“Fuck.” His voice broke into a cry.

“Was I a bad person?” He let go of my ankles, staggering forward and clawing at his hair. When he twisted around to face me, unbridled despair painted his expression. He dropped to his knees in front of me and leaned close, his shuddering breaths fluttering in my face.

“Was I worse than the urge?” he whispered in a sing-song voice.

When the alarms stopped, the intense red glow around him extinguished, I glimpsed how sick he looked. He was sweating. Pale. His cheeks were gaunt, floppy hair glued to his forehead. When Kaz looked at me directly, there was a fog in his eyes, something mechanical flooding his pupils.

His shadow was swaying. I could tell he was ready to collapse, ready to give up.

“Worse than… than Joey Cunningham and those kids who murdered a bunch of freshmen in seventh grade. I think I was, like, really bad.” 

He jumped back up, grabbing my legs, a whole new determination taking over his eyes. Kaz started to laugh. Loudly.

Like nothing else mattered.

“I don’t want to be a bad person. I can't be a bad person, right?” he said quietly. 

Then he tipped his head back and screamed at the ceiling, dragging me further, tightening his viper-like grip on my ankles. “Fuck!” Another pull.

“Elle, I know you’re tripping serious shit right now, but I would really… appreciate… some help,” he gasped. 

“I don’t know where we are, and the walls are moving. I keep remembering things that don’t make sense, and my head… my head feels like it’s burning.”

Kaz’s fingernails sliced into my flesh. I felt his desperation to escape the red lights.

“Come on. Please! If I knew one-punching you in the face would turn you into a sack of potatoes, I never would have done it!”

“Mr. Delacroix, stop. You are hurting yourself,” a voice crackled over an intercom.

“No, you did this to me!” he gritted. “You turned my head into this, and I can’t… I can’t think straight. I keep… I keep seeing things.” He tore at his face.

“I keep seeing things that don’t… don’t make sense. Why, Elle?” His cry sent shivers down my spine. 

“I keep seeing her. In every flash. I see her. I see her, and my brain is… is boiling! I feel like my head is going to explode!” 

The vicious cocktail of drugs in his system warped his voice into a sing-song tremor. “I think I’m going crazy!”

Kaz laughed, his eyes suddenly far too bright. Even through my flickering vision, the contrast of his blood against the marble corridor was horrifying. I could see every river of red sliding between cracks in the tiles, pooling and dripping down his chin, staining the blue gown hanging off him.

“Why is it all you?” His lips split into a grin, and for a fraction of a second, his old self, the one I had seen in my memory, seeped through.

The boy tipped his head back and screamed, “Why her? Fucking tell me!”

“Let me handle this.” A familiar voice floated behind us. I wasn’t sure where it was coming from, though I had a vague guess that we were surrounded.

When Kaz gave up and dropped my ankles, I sensed footsteps growing closer. I expected him to try to run, but instead he broke down, pulling his knees to his chest.

“Stop calling me that,” he said in a sharp cry. “Just stop!”

Like Annalise Duval, his mind seemed to have snapped, splintering into pieces.

The boy resembled her from earlier, rocking back and forth and whispering to himself, his hands in his hair, clawing out clumps. “Stop calling me that,” Kaz whispered. “Stop calling me that, stop calling me that, stop calling me that!”

When a pair of arms wrapped around his waist and tried to pull him to his feet, he lashed out like an animal, teeth bared. “Get your fucking hands off me!”

The stranger’s embrace followed him as he tried to back away, clamping down on his shoulders. I only had to see the masked face and those cruel, piercing eyes to know it was the same man who had taken away my real name.

“No, we are rectifying this right now,” the man said, struggling to hold the boy down. I watched in sharp flashes as Kaz slammed into the ground, back first. I remember trying to move, to help him.

Except I couldn’t.

I was locked inside my own body. The masked man knelt in front of Kaz like a father, and I really believed he was the boy’s father until he forced his head down, uncaring when the back of Kaz’s skull hit marble with a sickening crack, enough to disorient him.

“Mr. Delacroix—”

“No,” Kaz slurred. “No, no, no, no!”

“You are sick!” the man spat. “You are broken. Poisoned. Nothing you do will change my mind, young man. Whatever happened to you is clearly our own fault. I must admit, the last thing I expected you to do was force a broken tooth back inside your mouth. Now, that was the final straw.”

When Kaz stared at him through flickering eyes, part of me understood what the man meant. It must have hurt to see a completely different person in place of who he thought he had created.

“Do you really want to get rid of all our hard work? Everything you did to become a vital part of Darkroom? Your fans? The promise you made to us? Really, Mr. Delacroix, are you going to throw it all down the drain?”

When Kaz weakly attempted to fight back against both the man’s grasp and the odd name forced upon him, his wrists were pinned down.

“Listen to me,” the man said. “That is your name. You do not go by any other name, per what you learned inside the Red Room. Do you understand me?""

""You belong with us, son. You are part of the reason we exist, why we took a chance on this project, and it's time you remembered that. Brightwood makes the world a better place. It… extinguishes those urges people have by allowing them to consume it, twenty-four hours a day. You are part of that.”

Kaz let out an animalistic shriek when the man forced two fingers inside his mouth and pried it open. “What did I tell you? I gave you one simple instruction, and that was not to touch your back teeth.”

The motion of his hand, Kaz’s eyes rolling back, and his body going still told me everything I needed to know.

When my classmate’s head hit the ground, his eyes flickering shut, I knew the tooth was gone. For good this time.

The man held the fake molar pinched between his fingers before snapping it in two. He dropped it onto the ground with a frustrated hiss and got to his feet.

“I signed a contract promising that I would raise and protect Darkroom’s own, and I am held to that.” This time he spoke to the sudden influx of shadows surrounding us, as one in particular gathered Kaz into its arms.

I felt a presence attempting to lift me to my feet. “Mr. Delacroix has been severely poisoned. What I thought would be fixed by a new tooth had clearly blown up in our faces. Since the regression has reached the boy’s mind, I want him in the Red Room. Now.""

""The young man must undergo protocol 4-1-5 immediately. If we don’t, the boy will die. We need a stage three wipe, a full decontamination.”

Kaz was dying, bleeding out when they carried him away, his nose and mouth and ears hemorrhaging, his body convulsing.

I was frowning at the amount of contrasting red and white on the floor when I was pulled unceremoniously to my feet, jarring the world around me. That was the exact movement I needed.

I remembered being a little kid inside this fake world of Brightwood.

I had a loose front tooth.

And with the promise of the tooth fairy coming to give me a whole dollar for my tooth, I had spent the better part of the day prodding at my mouth. I wobbled it around until I was convinced it was stuck, despite being able to lodge and dislodge it with the roof of my tongue.

Halfway through SpongeBob SquarePants, however, I jumped up to get a glass of water from the kitchen.

It was that sudden jolting movement that finally dethroned the crown from where it had stubbornly sat for days.

In a similar fashion, the guard yanking me to my feet sent shockwaves through my body. I felt the twitching, moving tooth like it was alive.

Before I could fully register it to spit it out, though, I was back inside my contorted mind once again.

With sudden, sharp, slicing agony rattling both my mouth and my brain, I was exactly where I wanted to be.

Inside a coffee store. There was no Brightwood, no sterile white corridors smeared with my classmate’s blood. There was just the rain and my own twisting gut. The memory was in full clarity now that the tooth was gone.

I was sitting against the backdrop of a rainy spring evening with Kaz Issacs in front of me, leaning on his fist with a quizzical, yet sadistic smile on his mouth.

I remember wondering what exactly his expression was, because I had never seen one like that before. It took a while of pondering to realize what I was seeing. Insanity.

I had never seen true insanity until I met him, a haunting, inhuman glitter. His entire body was practically vibrating with excitement, like my fear was causing him exhilaration.

“Well?” Kaz’s smile widened. “Are you done playing your game?”

A girl who looked way too young to be working at a coffee shop plonked a chocolate milkshake in front of him, and he leaned forward and took a sip from the straw before flashing the girl a grin. “Thanks!”

He turned his attention back to me, taking three large gulps before tipping his head back and exhaling. Kaz blew a raspberry. “Tough crowd. How about a hello first? You know, formal speech! ‘Hello, how are you doing? Oh, I’m great! How about you?’”

His eyes were piercing, scanning every contortion of my expression.

“Oh, just…killing people for cash. You know, fun stuff like that. However, I'm not the fucking idiot putting it on the Internet.”

Before I could stop myself, I reacted in a frenzy, reaching across the table and slamming my hand over his mouth.

But to my horror, he just muffled a laugh into my palm.

“Do you want me to go on?” He waggled his eyebrows, and I could sense his sickening smile growing.

“There’s a lot of people in here who would love to know about your magnum opus from several days ago.""

His words were muffled, but it would only take a stranger straining their ears to get the gist of what he was saying.

Kaz knew this. And he was playing to my weakness, my obsession with keeping this on the down-low.

He cocked his head, his smile darkening slightly.

Subtle, but terrifying.

I found myself lost in his eyes, two holes of pooling oblivion. No humanity. “Or are you going to have common courtesy, hm?”

When I removed my hand, he sat back and took another sip of his shake. “Try again.”

His smile was teasing, but his tone was just like that of the texts: playful, and yet threatening. When I could only stare at him blankly, he laughed. “Oh my fucking god, dude, you're like, seriously fucking with me, right?” The boy groaned.

“Hello, it’s nice to meet you! I’m Felix! Fee, if you'd like. What a great night we're having!” he mocked. “Is it that hard to understand? Jeez, I find it hard to believe you could actually make a video.”

“My name is [BLANK],” I said. “Why are you here?”

He arched a brow, chewing on his straw. “Why do you think I’m here?”

I couldn’t resist my own laugh. “I’m sorry, how old are you?”

He curled his lip. “I'm literally one year younger than you, and it's not like we're different.” Felix leaned forward. 

“But I want you to ask me that question again. Think about it, [BLANK]. Why am I here, hmm? After all of my texts you ignored, my calls, even my Insta request.” 

He pouted. “Honestly, you would think after all I’ve offered you would at least return my fucking calls.""

He slammed his milkshake down, his smile unwavering. “You think you can upload whenever you want and you won’t get noticed by us?”

“It was for my older sister.”

“It was for my sister!” Felix mocked, lifting his milkshake and saluting me. “Great excuse! Still murder.” Something in his eyes twinkled. 

“Your latest, and only video, might I add, currently stands at almost four million views, three hundred thousand likes and seventy thousand shares. Which,” he whistled, “Damn. I’d call you Darkroom’s biggest thing right now, but I mean, I’m also in the room.”

He shrugged, draining the shake. “You’re maybe a close third or fourth if you knock LilSim off the top spot, but I will say you’re getting there. In fact, if you check your subs, your macabre masterpiece is just about to knock me down.”

I watched the boy’s odd, twitchy movements, saw him wrap his fingers around the milkshake and squeeze, popping the lid off. “Which, unfortunately, makes us, you know, rivals.” His lips split into a grin.

“And normally, I would, like, probably kill you.” He winked. “No hard feelings. But, urgh, the big-wigs have of course decided to use me to get to their cash grab.”

He kicked me under the table, tipping his head back with a groan. “That, annoyingly, is you.”

“I want nothing to do with you,” I whispered.

“Mmm hmm.” His smile disappeared. “You also uploaded a video of yourself mutilating a guy to the internet. Which, I gotta say, is pretty badass.”

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine, and I felt myself recoil in my seat. I swore I would never think about that video after deleting the app and taking all the cash from the views it got. It was bitter irony that the money was going toward my sister’s college fund.

“What are you saying?” I demanded.

He shrugged, and his gaze found mine once again. “I’m saying,” he dragged out the word like I was a preschooler, “Why don’t we help each other? I want my rep back, after a tiny mistake which wasn’t even my fault…”

He rolled his eyes. “How was I supposed to know vomiting wasn’t allowed to be shown? I can rip out my pop’s guts and that’s fine, but spewing? That’s not allowed. What is this, fucking YouTube?""

""Jeez. You would think they would treat their top influencers with some kind of respect, right? I mean, I’m literally at the top, if you ignore the nepo babies. I practically own these freaks, and they think they can shut me down for accidentally barfing on camera?”

This kid was insane, I thought dizzily.

Like, a fucking psychopath.

I didn’t speak, and his smile pricked back into existence. “Anyway! Darkroom wants to sign you as a full timer. And before you say, ‘oh no, I did it for my sister! I needed money for my family!’” 

He mocked my voice again. 

“That, my friend, is bullshit. If you had the guts, pun intended, to do that and upload it to Darkroom, then you have what they call potential. Not as much as a Redroom OG, but you're getting there.”

He smirked. “Also, you probably have serious problems, but hey, don’t we all? You've got to be fucked in the head to get our attention. And, damn, you certainly did that.”

“Who are you?” was all I could say. I swallowed hard.

Felix held my gaze. “I'm one of their best,” he said. “Darkroom made me. Well, a bunch of us.” He winked. “From scratch.”

“What do you want?”

He chuckled. “Jeez, enough with the who, what, when, where, and how! We're friends, right?”

""You've been blackmailing me.""

""Well, yeah. Because you're almost number one on Darkroom right now. As much as it pains me to say that, and trust me it does.” The boy tilted his head. “I’ve never been to school,” he said. “All I’ve ever known is killing my family.” He tilted his head again. “Do you want to know what I did?”

He leaned in close to me, lips almost latching onto my ear.

“I really wanted to know how the brain worked,” Felix murmured, his breath ice cold, his fingers tiptoeing across my scalp. I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe.

“So I split my dad’s head open and had a peek. When my brother started screaming, I killed him too! I carved up my big brother like a Thanksgiving turkey and went viral on Darkroom.” His fingers tightened in my hair, taking hold of my scalp. “So why don’t you start asking serious questions?”

When he let me go, I tried to stand up. Felix slammed his hands down on the table.

“Sit down. I haven’t finished with you yet.”

I swallowed the sickly paste creeping up my throat. “What do they want me to do?""

Felix’s expression lit up. He pulled out his phone, tapping the screen with his index finger.

“Easy! You do two kills a week. You can decide how you kill them. Darkroom will pay you 60K per kill, and depending on how good your videos are received, they could give you a bonus. Full protection from the police, too.” He cleared his throat.

“Now, what you can’t do is put out content anywhere else. YouTube, Twitch, TikTok—trust me, there are hidden communities that allow this kind of content to get past filters. The world is fucked and people want to see bodies.""

""But hey, you’ll get paid and accumulate a fanbase, and you’ll also end up on the front page.” He laughed when I leaned back. “Don't pretend to be disgusted! You're one of us!”

He continued. “There are three categories on Darkroom. We have the usual users who post normal shit, you know, like mutilation and kidnapping, that kind of vanilla crap."" 

""Then there are the ones like you: idiots with zero self-awareness who get a taste for killing and upload their filthy fixes. If they get an onslaught of likes and catch Darkroom's eye, they're invited to join.”

Finally, he pointed to himself. “And then there are the ones they make. Which are the OGs. So. What is it going to be?”

His eyes lit up. “Are you in, [BLANK]? You post a video every day of either mutilation, torture, murder, whatever, and bam. Instant cash. Get to the top and you'll start getting a following.”

His smile was growing progressively more maniacal. “Then you'll be able to stream it live, and streaming live? That's a whole different party once you become one of us. Streaming live means you’ve made it.” He winked. “If you know what I mean.”

""No."" The word sputtered from my mouth before I could stop it. ""I’m not doing that.""

Felix’s smile wavered. He reminded me of a kid who wasn’t getting what he wanted. “Well, the alternative is a visit to the dentist.”

“What?”

He opened his mouth wide. “I’m actually scheduled for tomorrow. I’m set for a lead influencer role in their ongoing project. If I manage to sign you on, I get 60K per appearance, my account gets bumped to the top, and my rep is back.”

He tilted his head. “I like you, [BLANK]. I mean, I hate you because we're rivals, but I think you could be something special. Sure, you're not like the Redroom OGs who sit at the top no matter what. But you brutally mutilated the man who hurt your sister and uploaded it to the internet.” He shrugged. 

""Clearly you have a, you know, an urge,"" his smile widening, ""to spill blood. That’s why you killed that man with no mercy and then chopped off his dick.”

“I’m leaving,” I managed to say, jumping to unsteady feet.

“Darkroom recently lost their leading girl, you know,"" Felix said loudly. ""Sure, it was great content for viewers, but now they’re looking for a replacement.” He tapped his fingers rhythmically on the table. “I wonder who that could be.”

I don’t know how I managed to stand.

“Leave me alone,” I spat at him. “Spread the video. I don’t care. If you come near me again, I’ll call the cops.”

I started to walk away, but the boy’s hand whipped out to wrap around my wrist. 

He jumped to his feet, no longer smiley and playful. His eyes glittered with that unbridled insanity I didn’t want to believe existed.

“But…” Felix mocked a pout and let me go, spreading his arms.

I should have run. Every part of me screamed to get away, but suddenly I was painfully aware of the teenage girls in front of me, giggling.

The businessmen on their laptops had stopped typing, and the more I noticed, the more I realized it was everywhere, a silence spreading across the store, reaching the baristas behind the counter.

I felt every eye on me. And when I forced myself to meet their gazes, their eyes were as maniacal as Felix’s. Their smiles were too wide. No, I thought dizzily. Their eyes weren’t on me. They were all on him.

“What would everyone think?” Felix raised his voice before bouncing in front of me with a wide grin. “Your parents’ sweet baby girl is a murderer? How would they cope?”

I caught movement around me, and each person, man, woman, teenager, was slowly lifting their phone to point at me.

Felix noticed, his grin growing wider. He knew he had an audience.

“What about your dad and brother?” He mocked a sob. “Your bullied sister!”

The boy shocked me by diving onto a table, and people started murmuring and laughing amongst themselves. He twisted around, still grinning, spreading his arms. “Come on, [BLANK]! Surely you don’t want the alternative, right?”

I started to back away, but a woman suddenly standing behind me shoved me forward.

“Or maybeeeee,” Felix continued, pausing for effect. He was speaking to the crowd this time, the people pointing their phones at me. “Maybe you do want the alternative!”

He stepped toward me, and so did they, in an almost zombie-like march, suffocating me. Their eyes were greedy, smiles cruel. ""What do you say, guys? Do you want [BLANK] to be your new Elle?""

They didn’t reply immediately, and his smile grew, like he knew he had them under his control.

""I fucking SAID,"" Felix cupped his mouth and kicked a chair over. ""DO YOU want [BLANK] to be your new Elle?""

""Yes,"" they said in a low drone, their voices blending together.

“What’s going on?"" My legs felt ready to give way. ""Who are these people?”

Felix shrugged, jumping back down. “Duh. They want to meet Elle."" He leaned close, hands behind his back.

I backed away, my breath caught in my throat.

Felix followed, holding up his phone. Up close was my own face staring back at him. When he blinked, so did the stream.

His grin was wild.

""Smile! You're live.""

The memory blurred for a moment, and I was only aware of pushing through people with the same smile, the same insanity sparkling in their eyes. I couldn’t breathe.

The glowing light of the coffee shop faded away as I threw myself into the night, pouring rain soaking me, a downpour both inconvenient and somehow a relief. I choked on my sobbing breaths as I splashed through puddles, trying to pull my phone from my pocket.

But my trembling hands kept failing, slipping and sliding on my sodden jeans. I could sense him following me, slowly.

Felix knew moving slower would only drive me further into my own insanity.

I could hear him intentionally kicking through puddle after puddle. I thought I’d lost him after leaping over a fence and cutting through a park, but in the haunting dark, unable to see a thing, his laugh bled into the silence of the night.

And I found myself screaming into my hands, my legs starting to give way.

I could see them, glimmers of phone flashlights illuminating the dark.

Like him, his followers surrounded me.

“I don’t understand why they run,"" Felix wasn’t bothering to shout. I sensed him getting closer, his steps quickening. “It just makes it more fun. And might I say, chat, I am having a great time.” 

Felix laughed. “Are you guys having fun? Because we’re not finished yet.”

Coming to an abrupt halt, I scanned my getaway options.

An alleyway with a dead-end, a wall I could climb, and an electric fence.

I was halfway down the alley when his footsteps stopped. I twisted around to face him, rain plastering my hair to my face. Felix was more shadow than human, a silhouette in the pitch dark. Even when oblivion had swallowed him up, I could sense his grin.

""What's your brother’s name again?"" His words were like razors slicing through me.

Nick.

I promised him I would meet him back at his place after I met with the stranger blackmailing me.

When I started to run, so did he, after giving me a head start.

He howled like a wild animal, hunting me down.

“Come on, Elle!"" His footsteps pounded on concrete. ""Why are you running away from us?”

When I stepped into my brother’s apartment fifteen minutes later, I found myself face to face with one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen, a blade inches from my throat.

Standing in the dull glow of Nick’s place, she resembled an angel, dark curly hair pulled into pigtails, a white dress hanging off an hourglass figure.

She was older than Felix, in her twenties, maybe. Behind her was my family: mom, dad, brother, and sister.

All of them had faces except my sister. I saw my mother’s frightened, wild eyes, my father’s grimace, my brother’s attempt at calm. But not her.

My sister was nothing but a confusing blur of gold that bathed them all in harsh light.

The girl had tied their hands behind their backs with Christmas lights. Her eyes glittered like Felix's, a cutting grin on her lips. “There you are!” She retracted the knife and stumbled back. “Holy crap, I was about to send out a rescue party.”

When I risked a step forward, she traced the curve of my throat with the knife. “You have a super cute family.”

“Sim, didn’t I say wait?!”

When the door rattled and a soaking Felix stuck his head through, my body went into fight-or-flight. I twisted, attempting to shut him out.

The girl’s arms wrapped around me, her warm breath dancing in my ear.

She was beautiful, graceful like an angel, yet her fingernails stabbed into my flesh and her words cut into me.

“Don’t do that.” She yanked me back forcefully. “That’s not part of the game.”

Turning to Felix, who sidled through the door looking like a wet dog, she laughed. “Sorry. I got a little ahead of myself.”

“A little?” He scowled, grabbing a towel from my brother’s couch. “Didn’t we agree to share content?”

“We did,” Sim pouted. “But I wanted to tie them up!""

Felix shoved me to my knees. When I cried out, he slammed his hand over my mouth.

""Now, THIS is a snuff film! You thought you were at the top? Darkroom spawns the sickest of the sick, subhuman trash who deserve to rot. The true unravelling of the human psyche.”

He laughed. “And that’s us!” He stroked his hands across my cheek. “You shouldn’t have challenged us. Darkroom wants you, but that’s their game. I'm looking forward to our new Elle. But first, I want to remind you of your fucking place. You're only at the top because of luck, sweetheart.”

Sim pressed her knife to my mother’s throat, humming a nursery rhyme.

“This little piggy went to market,” she sang, before slicing my mother’s throat.

My vision blurred. I was screaming, but no sound came out.

When I tried to lunge forward, Felix yanked me back with a laugh.

“This little piggy stayed at home.” Sim stabbed my father’s chest, then pulled out the blade, blood spattering her face. She smiled at me before moving to my brother.

“This little piggy had roast beef.” The blade split his skull, then went into his throat. “And this little piggy had none!”

Reality blurred as red pooled on my brother’s rug.

“And THIS little piggy…” The girl reached my sister, wrenched her head by the ponytail, teasing the knife across her throat. She smiled before letting her go.

Her eyes flicked to me. “She’s all yours, Fee. There's your content.”

Sim knelt in front of my sister, covering her eyes playfully, then revealed them. The glowing blur didn’t scream or cry, just stared.

“Do you want to guess how many people are watching right now?” Felix murmured. I didn’t reply, choking through sobs.

“Three million,” he said. “Three million sick bastards watching us carve your family apart, and I’m not even finished. Here’s what I’m going to do. Instead of killing your sister right here, I’ll take my time.""

Felix pressed his lips to my cheek in a mocking kiss. “I’m going to take chunks of her each day. Body and mind, so that when I do the big reveal, you won’t recognize her. I’ll make her last, don’t worry. And hey,” he chuckled. “Maybe just to see your despair, I’ll ask the big-wigs if she can be put into the project.”

He let go of me with a hysterical laugh. “Imagine that! Your own sister. When I’m finished, she’ll be begging to die.”

I screamed, but no sound came out.

""Keep screaming. That's what they love! When I was in Redroom, they sucked up my screams like a drug. These bastards feed off our pain.""

""Shh!"" Sim hissed giggling. ""We're not supposed to—""

""Oh, relax! It's not like Redroom is a secret. It makes Peekers!”

I felt his fingers pushing through my lips, choking me. “See! You do have cavities! Now, [BLANK], meet someone. She’s been waiting for you.” His voice was sing-song, and an aroma hit me like bleach. “Say hello, Elle!”

My vision blurred. I was back inside clinical white, strapped down, metallic plates glued to my temples.

I saw Kaz looming over me, or Felix.

The boy I had known my whole life, or at least the one inside Brightwood, was a lie forced into a psychopath. 

He was still in a bloody gown, but his cheeks had color, which meant the tooth was gone. That humanity he clung to was gone. I blinked through feathered vision as bolts ran through me.

I saw the slight glint of a camera in his iris. He bent down, ice-cold breath tickling my neck. In a sing-song voice, as if probing my brain and seeing the memory, he finished the nursery rhyme.

A familiar giggle came from behind him. An older-looking Sim appeared, shorter curls in pigtails.

A group of boys and girls joined her, surrounding me.

They must have been what Felix called Peekers.

Standing next to Kaz, laughing, was Annalise. Pale, sweaty, hollow-eyed, a puppet on strings. Felix’s words echoed:

""I'm going to take her apart mentally. First, her mind. Then pieces of her body. Not enough to kill her. One day, I want you to look at your sister and think: ‘I have a sister?’""

Something wet hit my forehead, Kaz’s blood spotting my cheeks as a stray thought began to blossom.

“And this little piggy,"" Kaz continued, fingers tip-toeing across my face.

""Went all...the way...home.""",1,1758463202.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Da Nang & Hội An (Days 3–6)
Fly in, explore Hội An Old Town, join a cooking class, enjoy the lantern festival, relax on Da Nang’s beaches, and try the nightlife. 

Cát Tiên National Park (Days 9–10)
Quick trip out of the city for hiking, nature, and a gibbon trek. Good balance of outdoor adventure before heading back to Saigon.

Saigon Again (Day 11–13)
Wrap up the trip with massages, food, and clubs. Provides a mix of downtime and high-energy experiences before departure

We just wrapped up our third Circle meetup at **Aeka’s Coffee, Baner**, and it was one for the books.

Eight of us gathered around coffee and chaos, diving into rounds of **Skribbl**, **Bluff**, and **Psych.**

Between games, we opened up about our **dating lives** (the good, the ghosted, and the gloriously awkward), and swapped stories about the **craziest Reddit communities** we’ve stumbled upon. From r/.indiangirlsontinder  to r.AITK , it was a rabbit hole of hilarity and curiosity.

But the real magic happened after everyone left.

One spontaneous post-meetup encounter turned into an impromptu **chicken thali lunch**—the kind that leaves you full in every sense. I wish all of us could have been here.

And just when we thought the day was done, we wandered up **Baner Hill and** walked off the thali. The plan was to catch the sunset... but the rainy clouds had other ideas. Still, the misty air and quiet trails gave the evening a soft, reflective close.

Here’s to more games, more thalis, and more sunsets that feel like closure and beginning, all at once 🌅\\

Hello, 
I'm having a problem with my Tassimo machine, and I don't know if it's the pods' composition that might have changed, or if it's my machine that has a problem.

I've had my machine for 3-4 years. 
Before, when I used it, the coffee had a very strong flavor. Nothing to report, everything was perfect. 
For personal reasons, I had to leave my machine for a year, and I was only able to get it back now. So, for a year, I stopped drinking Tassimo coffee. I recently got it back, and after using it again, I noticed that all the drinks I make have a much less flavor, and I don't really know why. 

I've already had the machine descaled twice, so I don't know if Tassimo changed something in their coffee, or if there might be something wrong with my machine.


Does anyone have a clue of if there is i could do to solve this problem ?

I have an aunt who, in the middle of my moms mental health crisis called me for the first time since I had been at college and screamed at me through the phone telling me I am a bad person and trying to pit me against my dad for false accusations.  She knew they were false and he consistently went through hoops taking drug tests to prove his innocence to my mom and aunt.  They told me I was a bad person and I was a sh*tty daughter because I couldnt come up to see my mom (we were trying and my now husband paid for gas, took days off of work only for us to get stuck on the side of the road bc of a blizzard).  My aunt and uncle also isolated my dad from my moms family and treated him terribly to the point doctors were worried about him trying to commit s*icide.  

My aunt is my moms favorite person, though.  And now that we are past that, I keep a rule that we try not to see my aunt for the exception of large family functions (christmas and easter).  This aunt wont talk to me but buys my child large gifts without asking and my mom says my child is also like my aunts grandchild since likely she wont have a grandkid. She calls my mom to talk to my child yet wont talk to me or my husband. I am at the edge of a panic attack as I feel she will try to feed my son the same lies she said about my dad and try to split our family. 

My sons birthday was this week and we are supposed to go to coffee today with the whole extended family but I dont want her giving my kid gifts and I dont really want to see her.  My son is at a very impressionable age and gifts are the way to his heart at 5 years old.  I really dont want to go but do want to see the other family members.  My mom doesnt understand why I dont want to be around my aunt despite multiple conversations about how she and my uncle treated not only me but my dad and brother 

How do I navigate this situation? I hate leaving people out and intentionally excluding but My aunt (and her husband) dont feel like safe people to me and my family.  Also keep in mind I have to live in my moms house again for at least another month. 

Also: please pray for me as Im on the verge of a panic attack because of this and Satan is attacking our family from other angles this past month.

TL;DR-- my mom is crossing boundaries when it comes to my son seeing my aunt.  How do I navigate?",1,1758462771.0,family,1,1.0,False

1nmsgot,https://v.redd.it/pvbv5gznviqf1,You guys better not snitch to 4chan about Charlie Kink memes on IG reels.,"IG reels is probably the only place where dark humor is applied to everything and not just minorities.  

Oh I love it when the joke is about a bigoted person who have done nothing in his Career but spread hate speech towards queers, women and POCs. and advocating for gun laws, despite the amount of school shootings. This garbage somehow got the NFL holding a memorial for him, and democrats (including Bernie Sanders) have voted to pass a national holiday (wtf) for him??

Okay. I'm an Iraqi and those news PARTICULARLY shouldn't bother me. However, not only the us controls most of the world and the fate of Palestine is in their hands, but also US politics are just, really absurd to non Americans. C'mon like. You can't blame me for looking deeper at unhinged shit like QAnon? 

Overall this whole thing is just, really surprising to me. I really did not think something big will come out of this, but now some right wing moids on Twitter (including Elon Musk lmfao?!) are stating this is war. What the helly. Over who? Him? Also. As far as I observed. It seems like almost half of Americans don't even know this guy. What is going on. Like for me, I know Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro, but I never knew about Kirk up until his assassination. Turns out he's the same guy from that meme of him drinking coffee and then lets out a zesty expression. 

Conspiracy theory time. I think smth fishy is going on here. For now, it's not really about Charlie Kirk; conservatives are taking this as an excuse to use his death for their own motivs. But here's my theory, what if this whole thing is just a set up? To stop or overshadow the Epstein files release, and to make right wing politics more dominant in the US? I believed in this theory up until the killer got exposed. Turns out he was just another white conservative kid, which shouldn't make much sense y'know. 

I don't celebrate his death; he'll be replaced by another dude anyway. I just really don't care about him, and I have no reason to. Those IG reels are funny tho. 

It's weird. Y'know US politics can be funny at times because what the hell you mean a rich country that taxes their citizens refuses to make lunches free for school students? 

(Also a certain sub got taken down by 4chan users. I wonder how they're doing on IG reels now it's full of memes about Kirk). ",1,1758462557.0,behindthebastards,0,0.67,False

**Chapter 3:**

It started around 2:47 a.m. I was locked in a caffeine standoff with a cursed kitchen appliance that only brewed good coffee if I made a blood offering or whispered affirmations in Latin. Neither of which I was in the mood for. So, instead, I was drinking a lukewarm soda labeled “Not Poison. Probably” that I found in the mop closet.

That’s when the motion sensor by the West crypt lit up. Now, normally this wouldn’t be cause for alarm. The west crypt has a history. Sometimes the lights go off when the ghost choir rehearses. Sometimes the gargoyles have turf wars. Sometimes it’s just Chuck returning home from one of his smoke breaks with a limp.

Regardless, I decided to check. Big mistake, as this time, it wasn’t Chuck.

It was... a woman.

Human. Mid-20s. Dark lipstick. Combat boots. Backpack covered in enamel pins and occult patches. She was holding a tiny microphone in one hand, a notebook in the other, and absolutely no sense of survival instinct anywhere on her person.

She crept along the crypt wall like she was in a Netflix documentary called *Teen Horror Writers: Behind the Screams*, whispering into her mic like she was trying to summon a Pulitzer.

“September 21st, 2:48 a.m. Subject has been spotted. Possibly the groundskeeper. Possibly undead. Unclear. Witness is armed only with sarcasm and one pepper spray keychain shaped like a bat.”

She didn’t see me yet. I watched her scribble something down, then reach toward a particularly cursed-looking statue that, in fairness, *did* look like it wanted to be touched. I stepped out from behind the chapel and cleared my throat.

“Touch that, and you’re gonna spend the next week sneezing spiders.”

She froze. Spun around. And smiled.

“Oh, wow, cool! Are you the caretaker?”

I stared at her. “Define caretaker.”

“Of the cemetery.”

I stared harder. “Define cemetery.”

“Okay, love the sarcasm. Very in-character. I’m Jade.”

She held out her hand like we were meeting at a book club and not in front of a mausoleum that once tried to eat a priest.

“Jade Greene. Horror writer. Paranormal documentarian. Local caffeine addict. I’m here doing research for my next project.”

I didn’t take her hand. Mostly because I was holding a flashlight. Partly because her backpack was humming.

“That bag making noise?”

“It’s fine,” she said too quickly. “That’s just Harold.”

“Harold.”

“My haunted portable EMF reader. It only hums when it detects ghost frequencies, radiation, or strong feelings of annoyance.”

I sipped the soda labeled “Not Poison. Probably” and waited to die. When I didn’t, I sighed.

“Let me guess. You saw a TikTok about this place, and thought, ‘Hey, what’s the worst that could happen?’”

“Actually, it was a Reddit thread.”

Of course it was.

“Also,” she continued, “I applied for a temporary visitor’s permit. I sent emails. I even left a voicemail. Some lady, Jessica I think, said it’d be fine.”

“Jessica says a lot of things.”

“And I got approval. So technically I’m allowed to be here. With supervision.”

She grinned. I stared.

The fog swirled. Something in the distance made a noise that might’ve been a wolf, or a really sarcastic goose.

“Wait,” I said slowly, realization dawning like a migraine. “You’re the ‘special guest researcher’ that Management emailed me about last week, aren’t you?”

“Yep!”

“The one I deleted without reading because I assumed it was spam.”

“Wow. I feel so welcome.”

“Good. That’s the goal.”

She beamed, and just like that, Jade became my problem for the rest of the night.

I don’t know what Management has against me, but somewhere, buried deep in the paperwork and unpaid invoices of this place, there’s a clause that says I’m not allowed to have a quiet night. And if I do, they’ll just assign me a horror-obsessed goblin in human form with a cursed backpack and the attention span of a goldfish.

“So,” Jade said, falling into step beside me as I turned toward the main path, “how many people have died here? Like, actual confirmed deaths. Not counting the ones who were already dead, obviously. Unless re-deaths count. Do those count?”

“No.”

“Are you sure? Because I feel like undead fatalities should have their own category.”

“They do. It’s called *Tuesday*.”

She laughed like I was joking. I wasn’t.

The gravel crunched under our boots as we made our way back toward the office cabin. The fog had thickened, curling around the tombstones like smoke from a very indecisive fire. My flashlight flickered once, then settled into that dim yellow glow.

“What’s that building over there?” she asked, pointing toward the East mausoleum.

“Storage.”

“Storage for what?”

“Bad ideas.”

“Like?”

“You.”

“You’re *so* lucky I think sarcasm is charming.”

“You’re *so* lucky I don’t have a taser.”

We kept walking. She hummed a little tune. Might’ve been from a horror movie soundtrack, or just whatever music plays in the head of someone who licks batteries for fun.

“I’m serious,” I said after a long moment of quiet. “You shouldn’t be here. This place is—”

“Haunted? Dangerous? Cursed beyond mortal comprehension? Yes, that’s why I’m here.”

“I was going to say ‘not up to code,’ but sure. Let’s go with cursed.”

I briefly considered just walking faster and letting her fall behind, but she’d probably trip some kind of arcane motion trap and summon a blood geyser. Then I’d have to fill out forms. Lots of forms. In triplicate. With carbon copies. And a notary. So I sighed. And kept walking.

“Look,” I said, “I get it. You’re trying to write the next great American horror novel. But this place doesn’t want to be documented. Half the anomalies here can smell ambition.”

“Good. Maybe they’ll give me a book deal.”

“Or maybe they’ll give you seventeen eyes and a compulsion to rhyme in German.”

“Still better than self-publishing.”

We reached the front steps of the office cabin just as something howled in the distance. Or maybe coughed. Hard to tell with the fog. Could’ve been a werewolf. Could’ve been Steve, the part-time gravedigger from the East lot. He’s got bronchitis and no boundaries.

Jade didn’t even flinch. She just pulled out a little recorder and said into it:

“Ambient sound: Class 3 wail. Possibly a banshee. Possibly respiratory illness. Note to self: bring cough drops next time.”

We arrived at the cabin and I opened the door for her.

“Inside. Before something smells your optimism.”

She stepped in like a kid visiting a haunted Build-A-Bear.

“Oh my god,” she said, eyes sweeping the cluttered, vaguely eldritch chaos of my workspace. “This place is *amazing*.”

“You say that now.”

“Is that a typewriter possessed by a 1930s copyright lawyer?”

“Yes. Don’t touch it.”

“And is that a corkboard with yarn connecting post-it notes and mugshots of squirrels?”

“Long story. Do *not* remove the yarn. I’m almost done solving that case.”

She wandered deeper into the office like an unsupervised Sims character, reaching out to touch everything she wasn’t supposed to.

“Are those real human bones?”

“One of them is. We don’t know which.”

“What’s in the safe?”

“Nothing safe.”

“What’s in the fridge?”

“Don’t—”

She was already there.

Before I could finish the sentence, she flung open the right fridge’s door.

A cold waft of air spilled out, along with the scent of expired yogurt and ancient hubris. Something shimmered inside. A jar rattled.

And there, sitting dead center on the second shelf—glistening with condensation and radiating divine pettiness—was Ares. War god, snack hoarder, refrigerator monarch, mango.

He glowed faintly. His voice, deep and echoing like thunder trapped in a can of Monster, rolled through the room.

***“THE MORTAL BRINGS OFFERINGS OF CHAOS.”***

Jade shrieked and stumbled back, nearly knocking over a stack of cursed milk crates I had *just* gotten to stop bleeding.

“Is that a *talking mango?!*”

“Technically, he *yells.*”

***“WHO DARES DISTURB MY FROSTENED THRONE?”*** Ares boomed, little droplets of condensation rolling down his peel like divine sweat. ***“IS THIS ONE A SUPPLICANT? A SACRIFICE? A DOORDASH DRIVER?”***

“She’s a writer,” I said, deadpan.

“THEN SHE MAY STAY. SO LONG AS SHE REFILLS THE YOGURT.”

“I don’t even *like* yogurt! I’m lactose intolerant!” Jade said, wide-eyed and clearly questioning every decision that led her here.

***“THEN YOU SHALL BE CURSED TO CRAVE WHAT YOU CANNOT DIGEST,”*** Ares declared.

She shut the fridge door very, very slowly. Then turned to me.

“Okay. What. The hell. Was *that.*”

“That was Ares,” I said. “He thinks he’s the Greek god of war. Might be. The jury's still out. Lives in the fridge. Don’t challenge him to Monopoly.”

“Why would I—”

“He cheats. Also he bit Chuck once.”

“Chuck?”

“Newport-loving raven. Decent guy.”

Jade blinked at me. Then at the fridge. Then back at me.

“You know what? Not even top ten weirdest things I’ve seen tonight,” she said, obviously lying,

“That’s the spirit.”

“So… what now?”

I dropped into my chair, the springs letting out a groan of protest and possibly a curse. I motioned to the second chair across from me. It had duct tape on one arm and something that looked suspiciously like a bite mark on the seat cushion.

“Now,” I said, “you sit. You stay in here. You don’t touch *anything* unless you want to be legally declared missing in seventeen dimensions.”

“And what are *you* gonna do?”

“Make coffee,” I said grimly, eyeing the machine. “Or beat it at staring content again. Either way, I win.”

She pulled out her notebook, practically vibrating with excitement.

“Do you mind if I—”

“Record? Take notes? Draw fanart of the haunted coffee maker? Knock yourself out.”

“You’re actually letting me document all this?”

“I’m *letting* you survive the night,” I said. “Whether that includes documentation is up to the cemetery. Not me.”

She sat, opened her notebook, and scribbled something I’m pretty sure was just “!!!” five times in a row.

Outside, the wind howled. Inside the fridge, Ares muttered something about “ambrosia privilege” from behind the fridge door. And me? I just took a sip of mystery soda and wondered how bad things would get before sunrise.

Spoiler: pretty bad.

Jade sat, scribbling wildly in her notebook like a conspiracy theorist on deadline. Every few seconds, she’d glance up at some weird item on the shelf — the shrunken head that hums sea shanties, the death bell that only rings when someone’s already dead, the coffee maker that beefs with you— and I could *see* the gears turning.

“So,” she said, without looking up, “any particular spots I should check out before dawn? Y’know. Iconic haunted sites? Forbidden shrines? Maybe a sentient outhouse?”

“You shouldn’t *check out* anything,” I said. “You should stay here. Sit still. Drink the expired hot chocolate and resist the urge to open the Hell Drawer.”

“...There’s a *Hell Drawer?*”

“Don’t ask.”

“Okay, but hypothetically—”

“*No.*”

She frowned and dramatically tapped her pen against her temple.

“Come *on,* Henry. What’s the harm in a little exploration? You think I’m gonna wander into the Fog Crypt or poke the bone god?”

“You absolutely would.”

“That’s fair.”

I sighed, already regretting what I was about to say.

“If you *must* know,” I muttered, “there’s the Red Lake. About ten minutes north of here through the woods. Sits on the edge of the cemetery. Big blood-colored body of water that tells you to kill yourself.”

“...What?”

“Yeah. Don’t take it personally. It tells *everyone* that.”

“That’s... awful. And kind of poetic. Wait—does it talk? Like, actually talk?”

“Sometimes. Sometimes it just sings. Sometimes it just shows you visions of your most painful memories in reverse while whispering all your insecurities in a child’s voice.”

“I need to see this.”

“No. You *don’t.*”

“Why’s it red? Blood? Algae? Dimension leak?”

“The fishmen eat wild animals a lot. Probably that.”

That made her go completely still.

“There are *fishmen?*”

“Yes.”

“Like, gill people? Full aquatic humanoids? Mythological?”

“Yes.”

“Do they have culture?”

“Yes.”

“Do they speak?”

“Yes.”

“Are they hot?”

“*What?*”

“For research purposes.”

“No. They are *not* hot. They are damp, territorial, and highly aggressive.”

“Oh. So like my ex.”

“Jade.”

“What? I just want to *meet* them.”

“No. You don’t. They hate surface people. If they see you, they’ll either drag you into the lake or throw barbed eels at your face.”

“...How barbed?”

I pinched the bridge of my nose.

“Jade, I swear on all three editions of the Employee Handbook, do *not* go to that lake.”

“Got it. Noted. Totally staying here.”

She gave me the kind of smile you give your mom when she says “no parties” and you’re already texting twenty people “bring beer”

My bladder chose that moment to remind me that drinking experimental soda during your shift has consequences.

“I’m going to the bathroom,” I said, already halfway to the cabin’s back hall. “Don’t. Move.”

“You got it, boss.”

Five minutes. That’s all I needed. Five minutes of peace, a mediocre piss, and maybe one moment where I didn’t feel like I was babysitting a cryptid magnet with a death wish.

I flushed, washed my hands in the sink that sometimes cried, and walked back into the main room.

She was gone. Of course she was gone.

“You have *got* to be kidding me.”

The front door was wide open. The notebook was missing. So was my flashlight. So was my backup emergency flashlight. And yep, for some reason, she’d taken the shovel by the wall too. There was only one place she’d be dumb enough to go with that exact combination of tools and optimism.

The lake.

I muttered a long string of curses, grabbed my coat, and headed out. Not because I was worried about her. But because the last time someone disappeared into that lake, I had to fill out a four-page incident report, two witness statements, and attend a workshop called *“Managing Cross-Dimensional Trauma in the Workplace.”* And I *refuse* to go through that again.

The fog was thicker now, hugging the ground like a bad omen in physical form. My boots crunched over old pine needles and bones I didn’t want to identify. Somewhere far off, a bird coughed like a fasting geriatric after a marathon. Probably Chuck.

And then, a scream. A loud, high-pitched, *very Jade* scream split the night.

*THUNK.*

Something metallic. Heavy. Impact.

“Oh no,” I muttered, picking up my pace. “Oh no, oh no, oh *hell no—*”

I broke into a run.

The trees parted up ahead, revealing the edge of the Red Lake: a smooth, dark surface reflecting crimson light from nowhere, surrounded by wet rocks, low mist, and the faint hum of sorrowful lullabies in reverse.

And there, near the edge—

“Jade!” I shouted.

She turned, panting, eyes wide and wild, holding the shovel in both hands like she’d just come back from a boss fight. At her feet lay a very dazed, very wet, very *pissed off* fishman.

“I *think* I made contact!” she yelled, like this was a Little League game and not aggravated assault on a sentient species.

The fishman gurgled in pain, a stream of glowing blue blood leaking from its forehead. Its eyes swirled in two different directions. One of its claws twitched.

“WHAT THE *HELL* DID YOU DO?!”

“It lunged at me!”

“Because you were in its *territory!* I *told* you not to bother them!”

“It didn’t say ‘No Trespassing!’”

“IT SHOULDN’T *HAVE* TO!”

The fishman groaned again, and I knelt beside it, checking for anything broken. It was breathing. Probably wouldn’t die. But I’d still have to fill out an “interdimensional diplomatic incident” form, and those *always* required Management sign-off.

“This is *not* how you interview a cryptid,” I snapped.

“He started it.”

“He *lives* here!”

“I just wanted to talk!”

“With a *shovel?!*”

She looked down at the weapon in her hands.

“Okay, in retrospect... maybe I panicked.”

I gave her the slowest, deadliest glare I could manage.

“You think?”

We stared at each other across the glowing blood puddle of an unconscious fishman. The lake whispered something about failure in Ancient Sumerian.

“Okay,” I said, cracking my neck and rolling up my sleeves. “We need to move him. *Now.* Before he wakes up and starts hurling acidic spines or calls the others.”

“The *others?*” Jade squeaked.

“You think there's just *one* fishman? What, he just plays solitaire down here and talks to the lake for fun?”

“Maybe!”

I sighed, slid my arms under the creature’s damp, scaled shoulders, and began dragging it toward the waterline. He was heavier than he looked. Slimy too. Like lifting a gym bag full of wet steaks and bad decisions.

“Help me,” I grunted.

“He looks... sharp.”

“I bet the edge of that shovel felt the same to his head. Now help me.”

She hesitated, then grabbed the legs. Together, we shuffled him to the edge of the lake, leaving behind a trail of blue ichor and guilt. It rippled. Something large moved just beneath the surface, a shadow the size of a small car with too many fins.

I raised my free hand and spoke loudly, trying to channel my best bored-waiter energy.

“He’s not dead. Just... concussed. Sorry. She’s new. Human. Poor judgment. I didn’t bring her here, she showed up. Please don’t retaliate.”

The lake gurgled. One wet, scaled hand reached out from beneath the surface — elegant, clawed, disturbingly manicured — and gently pulled the injured fishman back under. The water swallowed him with a whisper, then went still. We stood there in silence.

“So,” Jade whispered. “Are we cool?”

The lake belched once and then sighed. Which, around here, is basically a yes.

“We’re alive,” I said, brushing slime off my jacket. “That’s as ‘cool’ as it gets.”

# We didn’t speak on the walk back. Or rather, I didn’t speak. Jade attempted conversation approximately four thousand times. Each attempt was met with a silent, weary side-eye.

By the time we reached the porch, she was vibrating with guilt and adrenaline.

“Okay, so... I might’ve messed up a *tiny* bit—”

“You assaulted a cryptid diplomat with a shovel.”

“That could happen to anyone.”

“It has happened to *no one.*”

“But in fairness, he came at me with claws!”

“That’s just how they *say hi!*”

“Oh.”

I opened the cabin door. She stepped in behind me like a dog that knows it’s about to get the newspaper treatment.

“So,” she said slowly. “Should I, like… write them a card? Maybe bake something?”

“You want to apologize to a telepathic fish cult with a *card?*”

“Well, what *do* I do?”

“Nothing. You do *nothing.* You sit there and act like you’re *not* here. You become furniture. You go full couch mode. Understand?”

She sat on the edge of a chair, trying to look harmless. I picked up the phone and dialed the Management line. I waited for them to pick up. For thirty minutes. The silence was unbearable.

Jade had tried to make small talk three times. I’d replied with increasingly longer, more exhausted groans. She finally settled for chewing on a pen and bouncing her leg.

Then the lights flickered. The coffee machine started chanting. The clock on the wall spun backwards, then shattered.

A voice crackled over the intercom.

“EMPLOYEE 1737. STATUS REPORT.”

“Incident involving Red Lake and visitor,” I said into the phone. “Minimal injuries. No fatalities. Minor interspecies diplomatic strain.”

“DETAILS.”

“The new girl hit a fishman with a shovel.”

A long pause. Then, very quietly:

“...Again?”

*“Again?! You said that hasn’t happened before!”* Jade whisper-yelled.

I ignored her.

“No fatalities,” I repeated. “Diplomatic protocols followed. Target returned to lake. The situation is stable. Pending paperwork.”

Another long pause.

“IS THE VISITOR STILL PRESENT?”

I glanced at her. She gave a two-fingered wave, trying to smile.

“Yes,” I said. “Unfortunately.”

“ADVISE HER TO REFRAIN FROM STRIKING NATIVE SPECIES. SCHEDULE A MANDATORY ‘DO NOT ATTACK THE SUPERNATURAL UNLESS AUTHORIZED’ WORKSHOP. AND FOR THE LOVE OF KRAAK’THON, NO MORE SHOVELS.”

“Copy that.”

“ALSO.”

“Yes?”

“YOU’RE ON INCIDENT PAPERWORK FOR THE NEXT THREE CYCLES.”

“I hate you.”

“WE KNOW.”

Click.

I spent the next twenty minutes neck-deep in the Incident Report Form #D7-G — the long one — when Jade appeared beside the desk with a white envelope.

“I made a peace offering.”

“If this is a cookie made with lake water, I will personally mail your kidneys to Kansas City.”

“It’s a letter. A real apology.”

She handed it to me. I opened it.

It read:

*“To the Honorable Aquatic People of Red Lake,* *I’m sorry I brained one of your brethren with a shovel.* *In my defense, he startled me, and I was raised in a bad neighborhood.* *Please don’t declare war. I am very soft and bleed easily.* *P.S. Do any of you read horror novels? Would love beta readers.”*

There was also a doodle of a fish wearing a party hat.

“They don’t read English,” I said.

“They might appreciate it?”

“They come from a dimension that predates language.”

“So... maybe the drawing helps?”

I stared at her. She stared back with big, hopeful, completely deranged eyes. Eventually, I sighed.

“You’re lucky you didn’t get dragged under.”

“You’re lucky I didn’t get eaten. Then *you’d* be writing an *obituary* report.”

“Honestly, less paperwork.”

She grinned. I rolled my eyes and turned back to my report. The clock ticked. Something screamed outside. Probably the mime again. I didn’t care.

1nms33i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1nms33i/could_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_be_the/,Could the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Be the Nespresso Gran Lattissima?,"Testing the Nespresso EN640W Gran Lattissima coffee maker over several weeks has turned my mornings into an intriguing blend of convenience and indulgence. With its sleek design and a modern aesthetic, this machine is undeniably eye-catching, yet its performance deserves equal, if not more, appreciation. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast who needs caffeine to function before noon, this espresso machine became an essential part of my kitchen arsenal almost immediately. That being said, no product is flawless, and this one has quirks to consider.

**Modern Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out to me was the striking design of the Gran Lattissima coffee machine. Its matte and high-gloss finish, combined with the stainless steel accents, exudes luxury. Sitting on my kitchen counter, it looks like something straight out of a high-end café. The compact dimensions (7.9"" D x 14.4"" W x 10.8"" H) mean it doesn’t dominate the space, which is especially important if you live in a cramped apartment like mine. Cleanup seems easy at first glance—most of the removable parts, including the milk container, are dishwasher safe. However, smudges on the glass touch panel accumulate quickly, which can be a mild annoyance if sleekness matters to you.  

**Ease of Use: One-Touch Simplicity**  
What sold me initially was the promise of one-touch recipes. One button and voilà!—a cappuccino, latte, ristretto, or even just frothed milk lands perfectly in your cup. Being someone who dislikes overcomplicated systems (especially before my caffeine kick), I appreciated the Gran Lattissima's intuitive interface. On groggier-than-usual mornings, even my kids were able to navigate its interface, punching out hot milk for their cocoa. The sliding drip tray is a thoughtful addition too, accommodating cups of varying sizes without unnecessary fuss.  

[Check Nespresso EN640W Gran Lattissima price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b0cmz874n2/)  

**Performance That Delivers (Mostly)**  
This coffee maker houses a 19-bar high-performance pump, extracting flavors boldly and creating a dense crema that rivals any café I’ve been to locally. Heating up in just 25 seconds, it’s impressively quick, which means no waiting around for that first sip of caffeine joy. However, I did notice that making multiple cups back-to-back slows things down a bit, especially when the milk frother needs cleaning. On busy mornings, this was mildly frustrating.  

**Boons**  
- Excellent one-touch operation for various specialty drinks  
- Compact yet premium design with dishwasher-safe removable parts  
- Lightning-fast heat-up time for those rushed mornings  

**The Machine’s Shortcomings**  
No product is perfect, and the Gran Lattissima has areas where it could improve:  
- Milk frother requires frequent attention, especially during consecutive uses  
- Glass touch panel attracts smudges like it’s trying to collect its own fingerprints museum  
- While compact, it’s prone to jostling slightly when placed on thinner counters  

**Product Contenders**  
Comparing the Gran Lattissima to some peers, like the Breville Bambino Plus, shows clear distinctions. The Breville machine scores higher in milk texturing control for those who prefer a more manual finesse. Similarly, while the Keurig K-Café might be more affordable, it doesn’t quite measure up in terms of flavor extraction or crema density. What this Nespresso model lacks in control options, it certainly compensates for with sheer convenience and aesthetics. It’s worth noting that this is strictly for those who love capsule-based systems. If you dream of artisan bean-to-cup control, this will probably leave you wanting.  

**True Value**  
Interestingly, the pricing feels justifiable for its premium features and performance against comparable devices by other brands. The automation, combined with aesthetic appeal, guarantees you feel like you’re living your barista fantasy, minus the coffeehouse prices. For daily espresso drinkers who value ease over fine-tuned tweaking—this machine is worth considering.

When people hear “writer,” they think of someone hunched over a laptop, wrestling with commas and coffee stains. When people hear “creative,” they imagine brainstorms, big ideas, and sticky notes all over a wall.

But here’s my dilemma: I do both. I write words, but I also shape ideas. Sometimes it’s about crafting a clear sentence and sometimes it’s about dreaming up something that didn’t exist five minutes ago.

So what does that make me?

A writer who creates or a creative who writes or..or maybe just someone who refuses to be boxed in by labels?

The truth is, writing is creativity. It’s not just grammar and punctuation, it’s finding rhythm in words, creating visuals in people’s minds, and turning thoughts into something that sparks. And creativity isn’t only about design or campaigns, it’s also about storytelling, clarity, and connecting dots no one else saw.

So maybe I’m not choosing anymore. Maybe I’m both or maybe we all are.

Because whether you call yourself a writer, creative, strategist, storyteller, or professional coffee-drinker, the real win is this: making people feel something.

I catch myself reaching for my phone just to hear you say something ordinary, something sweet. I miss your little texts, your teasing, your warmth tucked into every word.

Evenings are the hardest. That’s when I feel the absence of your arms around me, your head on my chest, your laughter echoing through the room. I miss our quiet cuddles. the way you’d curl into me like we were made to fit.

So maybe sometimes I meet 1 person other than family members. I really love them and I am happy to have them as my friends, but other than them, I basically have no connections. In school, I dont talk to people. I have no school friends. So I dont go to parties. I just dont have anything in common with them except school things. They talk about boys and girls, or video games I never played, or they just talk nonsense in that weird tiktok language I dont understand fully.
I read fantasy books, and sometimes horror. Few people seem to be interested in that. This is the topic I can actually talk about with some people. Sometimes.
I watched Doctor Who, and basically all episodes in existence(only the 2005- series). I asked everyone of they watched itt but nobody. The best answers I get are ""I think I heard about it"". Why are there no people who like it in my county?
Then there is the fact that I have anxiety. I drink herbal teas to quiet it down. It works very good, and because of that, I know a few things about herbs and I am interested in trying new combinations and new herbs that might give me peace. When I talk about the different teas and how they affect the brain and the body I look like some weird drug addict. Maybe I am. I dont really know at this point. These teas keep me from having anxiety attacks every fucking day.
I like talking about drugs. I dont take any drugs, but I find them interesting, because they change our perception and our perception of the world is our reality. But again, I cant talk about the without sounding like a drug addict.
Of course its not the whole list. Just the past few months'.
I dont think these interest are so strange. There has to be someone who likes the same things as me.
Maybe it is that I am very introverted and I naturally talk less then others. Or that im quiet. 
You know... I probably sound like someone who doesnt have any problems and just wants to unnecessarily cry about things. But I really am tired, believe me. I live in my head and I dont know how to get out. I have no motivation, I have no real goals, I just say I want to go to university to make myself forget it. I go to the best school in my region, but I did nothing to get in.
I am a bit depressed...
I know that people need to talk to other people to be healthy. I want to talk to other people but I dont want to talk to anybody. I want the weird ones. Why are there so few?

I feel so much healthier. Next steps are working on myself. More exercise, eating better foods, working on being social again, and picking up art again.

Which are much more achievable now that I don't have the weight of alcohol on my shoulders.

My previous post was met with so many positive and sweet notes that it inspired me to do an updated version in my current journal book (thank you each one of you for your kind words, this community is awesome!)

Apart from updating the crops list from scratch, I also did the list for fishes this time, together with trying out a slightly detailed colouring of each item to the best that I can. The space was tinyyy and fishes were so challenging…

The stationeries I use can be found in the last photo! I often do these during work breaks so it’s mostly markers, coloured ink pens and highlighters, for those who want to try it out! :) You can also see how I do pencil sketches for the legendary fishes, that’s how I draft out the picture before inking and colouring.

I also made some mistakes 😅 I had to cut and paste another paper to draw over it (I let my co-worker have a go at colouring and… it was hilarious but I had to cover it) and some words were wrong which I either used correction tape or stuck a paper over it as well. I hope you enjoy these as much as I enjoyed doodling them out! 😊

1nmrv6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nmrv6f/explore_if_clorox_scentiva_disinfecting_wipes/,Explore If Clorox Scentiva Disinfecting Wipes Truly Deliver,"The convenience of Clorox Scentiva Disinfecting Wipes, packaged in a portable pack, has made my daily cleaning routine a lot smoother. Testing these wipes in various settings, from my kitchen counters to my office desk, gave me firsthand experience with what the product truly offers. The coconut and waterlily scent adds an unexpected beachy freshness, making cleaning significantly less tedious. I found myself actually looking forward to wiping down surfaces simply because of the delightful aroma.  

**Scent and First Impressions**  
The fragrance isn't just your typical clean smell; it genuinely reminded me of a mix of tropical islands and a relaxing spa. It's a smart touch by Clorox to pair the functional side of disinfecting with a sensory experience. While coconut and waterlily are the main scents mentioned, there are hints of hibiscus and peony that add layers to the aroma. Guests at my house have commented on how pleasant the scent is; some even thought it was an air freshener. However, those who are sensitive to fragrances might find it a tad overwhelming initially.  

**Cleaning Performance**  
I was curious to test the claim of killing 99.9% of viruses and bacteria, including COVID-19. Although I don't have a lab setup to verify microbial eradication, the surfaces I cleaned—whether it was the stovetop grime or sticky coffee table mess—felt noticeably smooth and residue-free. Its ability to break down grease and soap scum impressed me the most. I can’t forget cleaning the bathroom mirror; the clear-drying formula left no streaks, which is a bonus I wasn’t expecting.  

**Advantages**  
- Long-lasting, tropical-inspired scent transforms cleaning into an enjoyable task.  
- Convenient flex packs make it easy to carry around or keep handy in multiple locations.  
- Cleans stubborn grease, grime, and scum effortlessly while providing the confidence of killing viruses.  
- Prevents bacterial growth for up to 24 hours, offering peace of mind when using it on frequently touched surfaces.  

**Considerations**  
Now, while I praise the product's features, there are a few **less favorable aspects** to highlight.  

- The pack doesn't always dispense wipes smoothly; sometimes, multiple wipes come out at once, creating unnecessary waste.  
- Despite being bleach-free, the wipes shouldn’t be flushed, adding a layer of inconvenience for disposal.  
- The scent, as lovely as it is for the majority, could be too strong for smaller, less ventilated spaces.  

[Check Clorox Scentiva Disinfecting Wipes, Coconut and Waterlily, on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b097qgxszq/)  

**Design and Portability**  
The flex-pack design of these wipes isn't just functional; it feels like Clorox really thought about the user experience. These aren’t bulky containers that take up unnecessary space. The ease of slipping one into a car or bag helped me tackle messes while out and about. They’ve been lifesavers during long car rides with kids spilling juice or snacks on seats.  

**Target Audience**  
Families with kids, pet owners, or anyone looking to keep their living and workspace germ-free efficiently will find this product ideal. During my visits to the gym, I found these wipes to work wonderfully for wiping down sweaty gym equipment. People who have allergies or are sensitive to harsh smells, however, might need to test the scent before committing to the product.  

**Product Rivals**  
When I compared these wipes with other leading brands like Lysol and Seventh Generation, the standout factor was definitely the scent and grease-fighting power. Lysol wipes are effective but lack the pleasant fragrance that Clorox Scentiva offers. Seventh Generation leans towards being environmentally friendly, and while that’s great, they don’t match the versatility and 24-hour antibacterial claim of these wipes. However, both competitors offer better dispensing systems where wipes come out more consistently.    

**Value for Money**  
Given its combination of aesthetics (the scented experience), functionality (clear drying, grease removal), and practical design (portable flex-pack), these wipes provide excellent value. You’re not paying for just a cleaning tool; it also adds a sense of luxury to mundane cleaning tasks. This value makes it a competitive option against other ordinary disinfecting wipes, especially when factoring in its long-lasting bacterial protection.

Chapter 1 The Unknown Future Gamma

Trained to take over from her Father, Zalia is shocked when her best friends turn against her, but Zalia has found the perfect way to get back at them. 

She will humiliate every male that thinks a female shouldn’t be in a Pack’s leadership and she will show her best friends what they will be missing in their leadership.

***

Zalia

My name is Zalia, I am a twenty-six-year-old Lycan and the future Gamma of the Moon Stone Pack. Our Pack is the largest Pack after Mystic Moon Pack, the King’s Pack. 

Also, our Pack is one of the few Packs in our Kingdom that is a mix of Werewolves and Lycans, with my family being one of the Lycan families that live in our Pack.

Our current leadership each has a male and female Pup, but unlike what everyone seems to think, our future leadership will have two males and one female. Because I am the first born Pup of our Pack’s Gamma, it means that I will be taking over from my Father when they step down, something I have been training for since I turned fifteen.

As the future Gamma, I am smart enough to know how to take every precaution to counter any attack. Our Alpha has seen it happen over and over again during our training, that I have been putting the future Alpha and Beta on their asses more than once and I can see that our Alpha always had to hide his laughter at the embarrassment his Son faced. 

Luckily every Pup in his Pack was raised the same way, and no one got angry when they got their asses kicked by me. No one ever treated me differently because I am a female; they always listened if I pointed out where they made a mistake and most of our Warriors have grown because of it.

I am very contented with my position and my Pack. The only thing that annoys me is the Pack Visits we have to conduct every now and then: I need to tag along but no one in other Packs even realize that I am my Pack’s future Gamma.

When we arrive at Onyx Moon Pack, the Alpha and Luna are looking down on me, and they act as if I am the help.

This has been going on for a few years now and each time it gets more difficult to hold my tongue during Pack visits, but Alpha Brad had been very clear in his warning towards me: I am not allowed to harm anyone, just because I am better trained than most Pups I meet.

“You, get me some coffee.” Layla, Alpha Mike’s Daughter, is pointing me. 

“Why don’t you get off your lazy butt and do it yourself.” I growls at her and Donovan, our future Alpha and Gibson, our future Beta, start laughing their asses off. I doubt anyone has ever spoken to her like that and the dumbfounded look on her face is priceless. 

Her high pitched cry for her Daddy has me rolling down the aisles with Twilight, my Lycan. For Goddess' Sake, She is an adult and she should be able to fend for herself. 

Donovan stops laughing the moment Alpha Mike steps into the room, but there is no way on earth I can stop laughing and I don’t even try to hide it. 

Alpha Brad tries to talk to Alpha Mike in a normal fashion, but Alpha Mike is demanding an apology from us for making his Daughter cry, and we just stare at him in surprise. Donovan actually does apologized to her, but I flat out refuse to do it and Alpha Brad knows better than to try and force me. 

Alpha Mike is unaware of my temper and gets into my face, yelling at me to apologize to his Daughter. 

“Why on earth would I apologize to her? She acts like a spoiled six-year-old, maybe you should have raised her better.” I yell back at him and my Lycan Twilight nearly takes over control when he raises his hand, and he is lucky that Alpha Brad steps between the two of us. 

I would have kicked Alpha Mike’s butt if he had tried to hit me. Alpha Brad is very aware of the fact that I would have been able to take him down. 

This is why I don't like Pack visits so much, some act like everyone owes them something and as if they're so much better than the rest of us. On top of that there is the way they talk to anyone who isn't of an Alpha bloodline, would it hurt them to treat someone with some respect? 

Other than that accident, some even thought I was there because I was Alpha Brad’s mistress and some thought I was sleeping with Donovan or Gibson. None of them even thought I was there because I am Donovan’s Gamma.

I was surprised when Donovan didn’t correct them, but I blamed it on their Daughter who was ogling Donovan and her relentless attempts to get him to go with her. 

I am grateful that Alpha Brad instilled a great respect for the Mate-bond in all of us at an early age: you don’t sleep with everyone that is willing and you certainly don’t sleep with someone from your own Pack. 

I never slept with a male, even though many have offered but I shot each and every one of them down and I might have punched a handful of them for not taking a hint.

If Donovan or Gibson get agitated with females that can’t take No for an answer, they go for a run or to spar at the training grounds of the Pack we visit. 

I can’t do that because no one knows that I am the future Gamma of Moon Stone Pack and that means that they don’t allow me to train with the members of the Packs we visit. I don’t have an outlet for my frustrations during a visit. 

I always envy them because I can’t even go for a run without a Luna or Alpha talking down to me. No one questions Donovan and Gibson when they take off for a run or some training. 

That's why I chose to keep to myself during the visit—it causes trouble if I interact too much with those bimbos and assholes. 

Aside from my run-in with Alpha Mike, I stayed quiet the entire time, and he nearly paid the price for all the crap I heard during the visit.

Another thing I dislike about these visits is the fact that everyone tells me to eat less. I need the food to keep up my stamina and I need a lot of stamina for the patrols I run every day. I am a Lycan, it isn’t as if I will become fat and even if some of it sticks to my bones I don’t care.

Every Luna would tell me that I needed to watch what I was eating, that my Mate wouldn’t appreciate a Mate that ate so much, and that my Mate wouldn’t like a Mate with a size more. 

Ha, a size more. I have a size six and am proud of it, I don’t need to look like a stick.

Most of the Lunas are so thin I fear they would be blown away during a storm and still they complain about being overweight. 

During this visit though it was almost every female that made remarks about my food consumption and from the corner of my eye, I had seen Donovan and Gibson laughing, but I thought they were just commenting on the females through their mind-link. 

I am just glad that this visit is over, but unfortunately we have to attend to another grand meeting next: a meeting between the Alphas of all the Packs in the Kingdom and the Alpha King.

For over a decade I have been forced to come to this meeting. I didn’t have a choice though, our King demands that the future leadership of a Pack start attending after the future Alpha turns sixteen.

“Calm down, Zalia. You have two months of peace and quiet.” Donovan says teasingly. 

“Okay, was it necessary to remind me of that? As if I am looking forward to spending four days with them and no way to get out of it or to get rid of the frustration by running border patrol.” I growl.

Chapter 2 The All Alphas Meeting

Zalia

The day is finally here, note the sarcasm. The annual All Alphas Meeting has arrived and I have been training or running border patrol most of the time. Anything to keep my mind off the next four days.

We were taught that we needed to come to this meeting to learn how to get along with other Packs, but I think most Alphas use it to find a suitable Mate with a high rank for the future leadership of their Pack.

Because every Pup of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma that is fifteen or older tags along, just to make sure they get noticed by other Packs, and maybe a male or female takes an interest.

For our Pack it means that right now, our Alpha and his two Pups, Donovan and his baby sister Elinor are present, our Beta’s two Pups, Gibson and his baby sister Kali are also here, and then there is me and my baby Brother Slater. 

As usual, we are the first Pack to arrive, and a Warrior escorts us to our table in the largest meeting room.

More Alphas walk in right behind them and each of them has the Pups of their leadership with them. The males are dressed properly, but the females… I am not sure how to describe it. Some are wearing a skirt and top, but it looks as if they bought them a size or two too small as it barely covers their skin.

I wonder why their parents allow them to dress like that, my Father would kick me back up the stairs to my room to change. 

“What is so funny, Gamma?” Donovan asks through the mind-link and when I tell him my train of thought, Dad nearly chokes on the sip of water he took.

“You’re straight I would kick you back up the stairs. I don’t understand their parents either.Why would they allow their Daughters to degrade themselves like that?” Dad growls through the mind-link and we are all laughing as we see another female walk in, wearing a dress that leaves almost all of her skin exposed.

I scrunch my nose as I smell so many males and females covered in a thick, lingering scent and I nearly gag when a future Gamma sits down at the table behind us. 

“Ugh, couldn’t he have showered?” Kali shouts over the mind-link as a male sits down behind us, the scent drifting our way and I ask her how he is supposed to do that if it happened only a few minutes ago.

“Can you imagine that you would be able to smell almost all of them covered in that promiscuous scent?And not all of them did it with their Mate.” I ask her and every head snaps in my direction.

Our Alpha tells us that he feels sorry for us as we as Lycans, are more affected by it than Werewolves. 

“Yeah, right. How often have you asked Dad if someone smelled of that scent that wasn’t his Mate?” I ask him.

Dad starts laughing out loud and I know I hit the bullseye with my question. Kali and Elinor giggle as our Alpha turns slightly red. 

By the time everyone is seated, my Brother, my Father and I are breathing through our mouths and even the others have trouble breathing normally.

Today is for the King to welcome everyone to the venue and for everyone to mingle before the Pack meetings begin tomorrow, something I really dislike to be a part of. Most of these Alphas have outdated ideas about females or twisted ideas about fated Mates and I don't like the way they always stare at me or ignore my presence.

We all stand when the Royal Family finally enters the room and I see each of them scrunching their noses. “Looks like they smell it too.” Elinor says and I just nod my head. 

I had already seen the barely dressed female saunter over to a table near the stage and I felt sorry for whoever she came for. She sits down next to Mavka, the future Royal Gamma’s Mother, and both of them are talking softly as the female’s eyes keep wandering towards the stage.

Whoever she is after doesn’t respond and the scowl on her face becomes worse by the minute and I hope that none of the males in this room are her fated Mate. 

I hear Twilight, my Lycan, giggle at my thoughts. “What about females?” She asks and I am so thankful for the training Dad gave me or I would have been rolling down the aisles here.

The Royal Family allows everyone their five minutes of gossip. I never understood the meaning of it and I doubt I ever will. Why would you want to discuss which male could be your Mate? 

But then again only the future Royal Gamma is unmated and I actually feel sorry for him. “That is why she is sitting with Mavka.” Twilight states, “She must be after her son.”

Deimos

Four days of dealing with Alphas and Lunas that want to shove their Daughter in my bed, four days of my Mother Mavka trying to help those Alphas and Lunas. I am wishing I could just disappear while Goliath, my Lycan, is growling in my head at the prospect of the next four days and I know he will snap at our Mother eventually.

No matter what either one of us says to her, she keeps bringing females with her and I am glad the King told her she was no longer allowed to bring a guest when she comes over for dinner, but now she tries to force me to come home for dinner. Which I refuse to do and luckily I have my duties as the future Royal Gamma as an excuse.

My parents were chosen Mates and I know Dad regrets that he didn’t wait for his fated Mate. Mother started cheating on him almost immediately and when she was pregnant with me he refused to believe her until Doc could prove that I was his Son. After that he went to see the King and he was allowed to reject her on the grounds of infidelity. 

Dad raised me on his own, but Mother stayed in the picture hoping that I would get her back in to the Palace.  

It was my eighth birthday when I decided I didn’t want her there and she tried to persuade me by telling me that she was my Mother and that she loved me.

“Mother, you don’t love me. You just love the fact that I will be the next Royal Gamma and you want to take advantage of that status. The only time I see you is when you know that a lot of important Wolves and Lycans will be around, hoping you can find another chosen Mate to give you status and to cheat on.” 

Even Goliath hates her and her Wolf for putting their own needs before those of their Pup. Yes, even my Mother’s Wolf had been neglecting us, which is rare as a Wolf or Lycan’s instinct will always be to put their Pup first.

Ammon, our future King, pulls me from my thoughts as we walk towards the meeting room and we both stick our noses in the air, “Ugh, this is going to be one tough day.” He says as we both smell the promiscuous scent and I know it will hit us full force the moment we step into the room.

“Why is it necessary for them to screw around just before these meetings?” Asha, Ammon’s Mate, asks over the mind-link and Ammon decides to give her multiple reasons for it to distract her from the smell, unlike us she has more trouble hiding her disgust with these Wolves and Lycans and as the future Queen she can’t show those emotions outward.

I keep my eyes on our seats, but as every year I am surprised to see the females of Moon Stone Pack. They are the only ones that actually dress like leaders and I smile as I see all three of them doing the same thing I am. “Asha, I see at least a few females know how to behave themselves.” I say with a chuckle.

I nearly lose my temper when I see Mavka, my so-called Mother, at a table near the stage and besides her is a female dressed in… well, I am not sure what it is supposed to be. If that is meant to turn a male on, then I am probably broken and when I say that through our mind-link, Asha nearly trips up, it is a good thing Ammon always has a good grip on her.

Chapter 3 Food

Deimos

We sit down in our seats as the King motions everyone to quiet down and it takes a few minutes before everyone is quiet, except of course for a few females that think talking about whatever is more important. The King keeps quiet until a few of the Alphas finally realize it is because of the females with them that the King isn’t speaking.

Goliath points out that everyone at the table of Moon Stone Pack has a smirk on their faces and I have to stifle a smile as I look at each of them, “The females are better at hiding what they are looking at than the males.” I say to Goliath and we both chuckle as one of the females shoves her elbow into the side of the future Alpha.

I see the brunette smiling as she looks past us for a second and I wonder what is so funny, “Someone is trying to get your attention, Son.” Dad says through the mind-link and I already know what he is talking about, probably also the reason why the brunette is smiling.

The King’s speech is something we all worked on and we tried to get as many words in without actually saying a thing, it was good fun making this speech. 

Our Queen had made the start of the speech in which he welcomes the Alphas and Lunas for attending and Asha was the one to put in the Pups that were accompanying their parents.

We had laughed our asses off when she tried to find subtle ways to tell them to stop fooling around, but in the end she had managed to find a rather romantic way of putting the message out there. 

“Alphas and Lunas, your brought along the Pups of your current leadership and they will be our future.

A future we as the Royal Family have been granted already, we found a Daughter in your future Queen and our Son’s fated Mate. Something we all are longing for, something we are all waiting for and when we find our fated Mate we will become stronger and better.

Prince Ammon and Princess Asha had both been waiting for their fated Mate to step into their lives, and both of them want to express to all of you how grateful they are that they waited for the other to start their life’s journey, to have all the firsts as adults with one another.” He says.

I know he had struggled with that last sentence and he had thrown a few things my way every time I laughed my head off, he had choked on the words every single time. I hear Ammon laughing in our mind-link as the King looks from Ammon to Asha and we all see the look he gives Asha.

Eryx, the future Royal Beta, and I had taken it upon ourselves to put the meetings into the speech, but like Asha, we struggled to put down a lot of words that meant absolutely nothing and we needed help from the others to get anything on the paper. The King had said it was never easy to say a lot without actually saying anything.

At least we got the chance to practice, because in the future we have to do this for ourselves and it is not something I am looking forward to. 

“In the next few days, we all hope to have good and meaningful discussions about a variety of subjects, from training to security and from Balls to meetings.

We all hope that by the time each and every one of you goes home, that it will have been a fruitful event in one way or another and that we all can look back on a successful meeting.” He says as we see a lot of the Wolves and Lycans smile, but Asha points out that the members from Moon Stone Pack look as if they know that the King actually said nothing at all.

“Lunch has been served in the main dining room. I ask you kindly to stay seated until a Warrior comes to your table and he will guide you to your table in the dining room. It will be the table you will be seated at during every meal for the next few days.” He says before we all get up and follow him out of the meeting room.

We get some food from the buffet before we sit down and the Queen nods her head at her assistant, giving the unspoken order to let the others join us for lunch. The first Pack to be seated is Moon Stone Pack and they are at the table closest to ours.

The Alpha and Gamma sit down while the Pups walk over to the buffet and the brunette is joggling three plates with ease. I know everyone is watching her as she fills each plate with food, before she heads back to their table and places a plate in front of the Alpha and the Gamma and both of them thank her with a smile.

Many females look at their table with anger or envy in their eyes, but I know it is an unspoken rule that Moon Stone Pack gets seated near the Royal Family and I know they will not cause any problems with us. They like to keep to themselves just like we do.

Every female that walks to the buffet looks at our table for as long as they can, but none of us respond to it and I can feel their anger growing more and more. I see them walking in their high heels and it doesn’t look very steady to me, but with a plate of food they sway even more on their legs.

I keep my eyes on my plate as I hear Eryx chuckle when a blond nearly loses her balance. 

“Who on earth let her walk off without a guard?” Asha snarls through our mind-link and Sila, Eryx’s Mate, asks her why she is so concerned. 

“What will happen if that plate of food flies out of her hand and onto another Alpha’s Daughter?” Asha asks.

Zalia

This food is amazing and I can’t wait for everyone to have had their first serving. I need to get to that buffet again. Twilight agrees with me as a blond walks past us swaying on her high heels. 

“Why would you wear those if you can’t even walk on them?” I ask over the mind-link and as expected the males call out in unison, “Because they think it is attractive.”

I stare at each of them before I ask over the mind-link, “They really think it is attractive that they look drunk?”

Kali and Elinor burst out in laughter with me. Slater just chuckles as Dad shakes his head and Donovan just stares at me. And as always Gibson thinks my question is sincere and answers that they meant the high heels.

“Okay, you did notice that the Queen is also wearing high heels, but she doesn’t walk around as if she is drunk.” I say as I look at him and he finally realizes I had been pulling their chains. 

“Zalia, how did patrol go last night?” our Alpha asks to change the topic we are discussing.

“When I got there at eleven there was nothing to report, but about an hour into my shift, we had two Rogues at our eastern border. When they saw me they thought I was ripe for the picking, but Twilight decided to show them that we don’t back down from anyone and both were dead in a minute or so.

We didn’t have any other problems during the rest of our shift and before we left, I checked in with morning patrol, but between six and eight there had been nothing to report.” I answer him as I ask Kali through the mind-link if the buffet is finally free again.

She tells me that everyone has gotten their plate of food, but before I can get up my Dad growls at me, “Zalia, you are telling me you stayed out on patrol all night, that you haven’t slept at all?” He says and as I get up to head for the buffet I say, 

“Just like always, Dad. Why would going to this meeting need to change my routine? 

I didn’t ask to be dragged down here. I didn’t ask anyone to make up this rule that the Pups of our leaderships need to be paraded in front of everyone and I sure didn’t ask anyone to force the future leaderships to be present at every boring meeting.

Now, if you’ll excuse me or not for that matter, I need some more food before Twilight decides she is going to eat and then it won’t be from a plate.” 

I walk away knowing full well that everyone in the dining room heard his question and my answer and I know that is what Dad was going for.

I keep my eyes on the buffet, but I can see a lot of males staring at me and I know I will get a lot of questions during our mingling session after lunch. Yippie, already looking forward to it, Not. At least now all of them will know that I am a Gamma’s Daughter and that means that their attentions will most likely be far from sexual.

“You run border patrol often?” I hear the King’s voice ask as the entire room goes quiet and I turn towards him as I answer him, “Yes, Your Majesty. I run border patrol in the same shift as my team, just because I am the Daughter of our Pack’s Gamma doesn’t mean I have to act like a spoiled little brat.

I can take care of myself as I have been training since I turned seven and I started running border patrol when I was forced to come to these meetings. I told our Alpha if I was old enough to be dragged down here, I sure was old enough to run border patrol.

Just between you and me, Your Majesty. I think running border patrol is a lot safer than coming here.” I make a little bow before I head back to our table and I can hear the King chuckle behind me, everyone at the Royal table is chuckling and giggling.

Deimos

How does she look so good after missing a good night’s sleep? I always feel like crap after running patrol at night and I always need most of the day to sleep it off. Goliath is rolling down the aisles when she answers her Father and I hear Ammon laughing through our mind-link.

“Dad, can we keep her?” He asks and I know exactly why he is asking, she isn’t shy with her opinions. ",1,1758460935.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

It was onivorous, eating mostly fish and sometimes honey and berries, like a bear, and it also had the size of a modern pitbull, using its large jaws to clamp on fish swimming in the river, squeeze and eat their roe, and after that crush the fish and eat it

Its really strange how this creature even survived the permian triassic transition, most of this is based on pure deduction because more fossils of the species were found with fish fossils in the place that was supposed to be its stomach

Sitting here drinking some coffee this morning, before I drop the kids back off with their mom. Divorce was as gnarly as could be, don't get me wrong. Yesterday our daughter had a softball game, and for the first time in probably two years had a conversation that wasn't contentious. Of course that may be because our 7yr anniversary would have been tomorrow, but who knows. Anyhow, we had some casual conversation about our new potential interests, what they do, what they have in common, how she thinks the new guy and I might unfortunately get along really well. She may have found a house, and I'm truly excited for her, but I looked at this person yesterday and I didn't see hatred or feel betrayal, but for awhile I have. I saw, for lack of better term, someone different than the woman I married. Someone having an identity crisis and figuring her stuff out on her own. (This isn't intended to be a negative stab at her, either). It just took me back a bit and made me wonder why we couldn't have just communicated, why she (in my mind) chose the harder path. I am genuinely happy for her that she seems happier now and I am not doing too terrible myself. I know things aren't always about being materialistic, but we had the house. She had the money. I adopted our daughter. Just made me wonder what clicked in her head that made her decide it'd be better to start over.

  
I might be in my feelings because of tomorrow, or maybe yesterday just brought up some old memories and I felt the need to blurt them out on the internet.

  
Anyways, happy Sunday guys!

- Integrated grinder, espresso boiler, milk frother and 30 lb stainless‑steel unit (17.5"" × 10.4"" × 14.3"").
- Over 100,000 drink recipes available via touchscreen, companion app, or Alexa voice (note: Alexa cannot power the machine on).
- Produces 9‑bar espresso; automatic grind size adjusts for drip or espresso, and a dedicated milk carafe offers heating and frothing with a steam‑intensity dial.
- Self‑cleaning cycles, water‑tank, drip‑tray and grounds‑bin alerts; grounds bin holds nine pucks, requiring emptying after roughly nine brews.
- Retail price $1,995, with a $300 discount when paired with a coffee subscription; rental option at $119/month; sold through Terra Kaffe’s site and retailers such as Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom.

Why it matters: The TK‑02 consolidates multiple coffee appliances into one, potentially offsetting its high price for households that would otherwise buy separate grinder, drip brewer and espresso system, but its size and maintenance demands may limit appeal.

1nmrp53,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nmrp53/evaluate_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario/,Evaluate the best pour over coffee maker Hario V60 worth it,"The Hario V60 Metal Coffee Dripper, VDM-02HSV, has genuinely redefined my coffee brewing experience. It’s unlike any coffee maker I’ve tested before. This dripper boasts a sleek, metallic design and feels premium the moment you unbox it. The first thing that struck me was its lightweight yet sturdy construction—it feels like a tool a coffee connoisseur would appreciate, and frankly, I’m not just impressed but borderline obsessed with the precision it offers. That shiny metallic finish truly stands out on my coffee station, and it matches most modern kitchen designs seamlessly.

**Precision Brewing and User Experience**  
Using the Hario V60 has become my daily ritual, especially on those mornings where I need caffeine to function. The cone filter design is one of the standout features. It encourages a slow and controlled pour, allowing for a more even extraction of coffee grounds. I’ve spent years trying manual brewing appliances, yet the way this dripper controls water flow and timing feels nearly professional. The paper filters, while somewhat of an added expense, make a noticeable difference by enhancing the clarity and depth of flavor. Even on rushed mornings, the dripper is easy to set up, use, and clean—a major plus for me, especially when juggling other tasks.

**Highlights**  
- Offers precision and control over the brewing process.  
- Lightweight but durable metallic body.  
- Aesthetically pleasing design enhances any kitchen.  

[See Hario V60 Metal Coffee Dripper, VDM-02HSV deals on Amazon now.](https://newcookware.com/p/b00bd1n8wc/)

**Capacity and Practicality**  
This dripper is marketed as a Size 02, which promises to brew 1–4 cups of coffee per use. For someone like me who sometimes brews just one perfect cup or needs enough for a guest or two, this is incredibly versatile. With its compact size, it’s also very travel-friendly. I’ve even packed it for a weekend trip with minimal hassle. Would I recommend this to someone brewing for large families or multiple people daily? Maybe not—it’s obviously designed with the individual or small groups in mind. The manual operation might also be a roadblock for anyone seeking push-button convenience. But for those who revel in the art of coffee-making, it’s satisfying.

**Merits**  
- Portable design, perfect for travel.  
- Easily serves anywhere between 1–4 cups.  
- Simple to clean, despite the intricate cone structure.

**Coffee Flavor and Performance**  
I’ve tested this dripper with medium and dark roast beans, and the results are outstanding. The cone shape and narrow spout of the dripper ensure optimal contact between water and coffee grounds, resulting in a brew that’s both robust and remarkably smooth. You can taste the layers in each sip—there’s no muddiness that you sometimes encounter with less refined pour-over systems. On a personal note, my partner, who doesn’t usually care for fancy coffee gear, has even commented on the improved flavor. That’s saying something!

**Areas for Improvement**  
Like most manual drippers, it does have a bit of a learning curve. Precise water temperature and pouring techniques are critical. It took me a couple of attempts (and some over-extracted coffee) before I nailed my process. Another consideration is the reliance on paper filters. It’s an added ongoing expense, though you could opt for reusable filters if sustainability is a priority for you.  

- A learning curve for beginners.  
- Paper filters are an ongoing cost.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing it to rival pour-over systems like the Chemex or Kalita Wave, the Hario V60 has a distinct edge in terms of precise brewing control. The Chemex, for instance, leans heavily into aesthetics and brewing for larger volumes, but it’s bulkier and less ideal for single-cup servings. Meanwhile, Kalita Wave offers a more foolproof flat-bottomed design but doesn’t have the same versatility when it comes to grind size or water temperature adjustments. The V60, in my opinion, hits the sweet spot between artistry and functionality, catering perfectly to coffee enthusiasts who enjoy tweaking their brews.

**Value for Money**  
Is it worth the investment? Absolutely. The price-to-quality ratio is excellent, especially considering the build and performance. While it’s not the cheapest option out there, the experience and consistency it delivers make it feel premium. If you’re someone who spends a good chunk of change at coffee shops like I used to, owning this dripper can help you save in the long run. It gives you cafe-quality coffee without that daily expense. Plus, for something so durable, it feels like a long-term purchase.

1nmrlyp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmrlyp,Dafuq! Kaya tanga ang label sa inyo!,"Madre na wala lang man POLITICAL AGENDA, nag hope lang for peace pero pinatiggil nyo? 

Media nag cover lang sa RALLY FOR CORRUPTION, NINAKAWAN NYO!?

F*CK THE CORRUPT AND F*CK YOU ALL FOR VOTING THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE! 

OPEN YOUR EYES! MARUNONG NAMAN SANA KAYO MAG POST AT MAG BASA,  FOR SURE MARUNONG KAYO UMINTINDI NG REASON!



I already know the answer to this question—again.
But I wanted to see the data and share it with you.

I wanted to give Sara Duterte the benefit of the doubt. (Malay mo, baka kasi tama ang mga DDS at presidentiable naman pala talaga siya?

And who better to compare her with than Leni Robredo?

I know this comparison is not fair. It might offend some Kakampinks.

But to me, Robredo is the epitome of frugal, effective, and efficient leadership and management. (I dare you to prove me wrong.)

So I laid it all out.
(All information here is publicly available.)

1. Before they were VP

Leni Robredo was a human rights lawyer.
She worked with farmers, fisherfolk, and indigenous communities.
She marched with the Sumilao farmers and helped them reclaim their land.
She authored three national laws during her first term in Congress.

Sara Duterte was a two-term mayor of Davao.
She had a 93% approval rating and briefly worked at the Supreme Court.
But at the national level, she had no legislative experience and no advocacy background.

If someone wants to be president, I need more than local popularity. I need to see national readiness. Sara didn’t have it then—and it shows now.

2 . Poverty programs

Robredo created Angat Buhay.
It helped over 622,000 families across 223 cities and municipalities.
She raised ₱520 million through partnerships with 372 NGOs and the private sector.
No government handouts. No red tape. Just organized, targeted help.

Duterte used government funds to provide ₱1.2 billion in medical aid and ₱130 million in burial assistance.
There was no larger poverty alleviation strategy, no clear metrics, and no public-private partnerships.

It’s easy to distribute funds. It’s harder to design a real solution. One built partnerships. The other just spent. That’s not leadership—it’s logistics.

3. COVID-19 response

Robredo led from the front during the hardest parts of the pandemic.
She launched Swab Cab, Bayanihan E-Konsulta, and Vaccine Express.
She provided free shuttle services when transportation was shut down.
₱17.3 million raised, thousands of PPEs donated, and healthcare workers supported.

Duterte took office after the peak of the pandemic.
As vice president, she had no COVID-19 response.
None.

A crisis reveals who’s built to serve. Robredo stepped up when it mattered. Duterte missed the storm—and stayed silent after.

4. Education efforts

Robredo responded to school closures by building Community Learning Hubs.
She mobilized youth organizations and held summits to keep education going, even without formal classrooms.

Duterte promised to fix school infrastructure.
DepEd under her aimed to build 6,379 new classrooms in 2023. Only 192 were completed—just 3% of the target.
For repairs, only 208 classrooms were fixed by DepEd and 155 more by DPWH. Out of a 7,550 target, that’s just 4.8%.
Thousands more were delayed, under procurement, or still under construction by early 2024.

This is what sealed it for me. Thousands of classrooms promised. Almost nothing delivered. If she can’t fix classrooms with a billion-peso budget, how can she run a country?

5. Budget and transparency

Robredo worked with a modest budget—₱663 million to ₱900 million per year.
Despite that, the Office of the Vice President earned four consecutive “unqualified opinions” from the Commission on Audit.
That’s the highest audit rating possible.
She also kept ISO 9001:2015 certification throughout her term.

ISO certification means the office followed international standards for quality and accountability. Robredo earned that.

Duterte's OVP was given ₱2.3 billion in 2023.
But DepEd’s own finance unit couldn’t explain how ₱112.5 million in confidential funds were spent.
In 2025, Congress cut her OVP budget down to ₱733 million.

Transparency is not just about paperwork. It’s about trust. And with Duterte, that trust is broken.

6. Peace and security

Robredo didn’t run counter-insurgency programs.
She focused on addressing inequality and empowering communities.

Duterte implemented Peace 911 in Davao.
A local initiative that ended a 40-year insurgency in Paquibato district.
Service caravans, gardening programs, and a surrender hotline.
By 2022, Davao was declared insurgency-free.

> I’ll give her credit—Peace 911 worked. But that’s Davao. That’s her turf. And that’s as far as her success went. Kaya siguro hanggang mayor lang talaga.

7. International recognition

Robredo received global awards.
Most Influential Woman by FWN.
Honorary Outstanding Woman from the Thai government.
Invited speaker at Harvard and Princeton.
Recognized for her work in governance and women’s rights.

Duterte became president of SEAMEO, a regional education group.
But there’s no record of international awards or major recognition.

Leaders get invited to speak when the world sees value in what they’ve done. Robredo inspired nations. Duterte? Not even close.

8. Program scope and delivery

Robredo’s office delivered results using volunteer networks, private donations, and partnerships.
Angat Buhay was never government-funded, but it reached farther than most public programs.

Duterte’s OVP opened seven satellite offices.
Her programs were fully funded by the government.
There’s no program under her watch that comes close to the scale or impact of Angat Buhay.

This was the clearest contrast for me. One proved you don’t need billions to make impact. The other had billions—and still fell short.

9. The book

Duterte authored a children’s book called Isang Kaibigan.
It was funded with taxpayers’ money.
Critics called it campaign propaganda disguised as literature.
It’s listed as an “accomplishment” on DepEd’s official website.

Robredo never used public funds for self-promotion.
No books. No campaigns. No vanity projects.

A children’s book paid with people’s money? That alone tells me what kind of president she’d be. Self-serving, masked as public service.

10. Style of governance

Robredo was partnership-driven, low-profile, and transparent.
She didn’t rely on showmanship—she focused on service.

Duterte centralized power and scaled operations with bigger budgets.
But with confidential funds and unfinished projects, her results fall short.

Good governance is simple: do the work, account for every peso, and don’t make it about you. Only one of them lived up to that.

Final comparison

COVID Response: Robredo
Audit Ratings: Robredo
Flagship Programs: Robredo
Peace-building: Duterte
Education Delivery: Robredo (despite no cabinet post)
International Recognition: Robredo
Confidential Funds: Duterte—no breakdown, no transparency

Robredo did more with less.
Duterte spent more, delivered less.

You can spin numbers and stage photo ops—but facts don’t lie. Track record tells me who can lead. And who can’t.

Morning Coffee Thoughts  reflection:

One vice president redefined the role with accountability, compassion, and results.
The other handed out backpacks, built a book, and couldn’t even deliver on basic classroom goals.

This is not about personality. This is about performance.
The records are public. The results are there.

If Sara Duterte wants to be president, she needs more than press releases and political machinery.
She needs proof.
And right now, she doesn’t have it.",21,1758460341.0,Philippines,1,0.96,False

**Chapter Ten: The Test**

Wei pinned the last of the scans to the board and stepped back, his fingers faintly smudged with dry-erase ink. The whiteboard now held a messy constellation of symptoms, brain images, behavioral observations, and the growing spectrum of what MIMS did. It wasn’t neat, but it was clear: the virus worked by amplification, not suppression.

Langston tapped a marker against her leg. “We’ve charted effects. That’s useful. But we still don’t know if it’s predictable.”

“We can’t model a spread this wide from one Devoste,” Bates added. “We need more cases. Full neurological baselines. Pre- and post-MIMS.”

Wei gave a small, thoughtful nod. “Then we need test subjects.”

Langston lowered the marker. “Volunteers?”

“No one would consent to this,” Bates said. “Not in time.”

Wei didn’t speak. He was watching Langston.

She met his gaze, paused, then sighed. “I know a guy. Department of Corrections. He owes me a favor.”

Bates blinked. “You’re suggesting we test this on prisoners?”

Langston didn’t flinch. “They already sign medical waivers for all kinds of things. Dental, behavioral modification trials, hormone treatments. If we lean on our original human trial authorization paperwork and reframe this as a neuromodulation protocol...”

Wei finished for her: “We’re still inside the bounds of what was approved. Technically.”

Bates closed her eyes for a moment. Then she nodded once. “We don’t test on the vulnerable. Not usually. But this isn’t usual.”

Langston was already opening a secure call channel. “Denton Correctional Facility. Low security, mostly federal offenders. The warden won’t ask too many questions.”

Within 48 hours, they had access. Three official volunteers. Full biometric intake, MRI mapping, and pre-intervention behavioral logs. Control and test groups were arranged in separate dorms to avoid cross-contamination.

And then someone got lazy.

A technician that was young, overworked, and doubted that ELM was as bad as the media portrayed it to be became increasingly dismissive of the strict protocol. He had not seen and ELM outbreak in person, and felt that the trials for a cure or vaccine was government overreach. He believed in his immune system.    


He decided to mist the test subjects and the control group on different sides of the mess hall but at the same time. But MIMS didn’t need a direct dose. The virus was airborne, its particles clinging to clothing and skin, traveling through shared air with frightening ease. The ventilation in the mess hall circulated between both dorm wings, merging the spaces that were meant to be isolated. The technician then sat for lunch in the admin lounge, leaving his mask off after eating. He touched a coffee pot handle, laughed at a joke, and adjusted someone’s badge strap without thinking. By the next morning, one of the guards was humming a melody he didn’t remember learning.

Back in the lab, Langston scrolled through the expanding dataset and groaned. “It’s spreading faster than we thought. No direct dose needed.”

Bates looked up from her terminal. “It’s Julio all over again. Just one exposure, and then...”

Wei nodded. “Skin contact. Shared air. Possibly even residual scent particles on clothing. It’s not just contagious. It’s clingy.”

Langston added, “We’re looking at full exposure within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. And if Resistants are just asymptomatic carriers, then we’re already at near total saturation. One hundred percent infection rate. Its astounding.""

Bates said, “And if not? Then eighty-five percent minimum. Which tracks with what we’re seeing.”

They reviewed the footage from the lab to compare. Julio had walked the corridor after cleaning Devoste’s room, then into the staff locker room, then out into the parking garage.

Langston frowned. “He didn’t cough. Didn’t sneeze. Just breathed.”

“And that was enough,” Bates said. “Now we’re watching it again.”

The doctors watched the data flood in and despaired, their screens awash in cascading logs, erratic behavior charts, and streaming vitals that refused to fit any known pattern. The sheer volume of information overwhelmed their senses with blinking indicators, conflicting trends, and the quiet knowledge that they were no longer documenting an experiment, but witnessing a transformation beyond their control. Bates felt her pulse climb with each new data burst, while Langston muttered under her breath, scrolling too fast to process. Even Wei, who had been so composed, sat with his head bowed slightly, as if absorbing the tidal shift of something far larger than their models had ever dared to predict. The three men they had dosed directly all showed signs of rapid emotional unburdening and fell into a Basic state within 18 hours. Quietly obedient but non-responsive to deep prompts.

“Everything we wanted to study, and now they can’t even describe what they’re feeling,” Bates muttered.

“Of course they can’t,” Langston snapped. “We scrubbed their ability to care.”

But then things got weirder. Some of the inmates who hadn’t signed up for the study began exhibiting non-Basic traits. One began journaling obsessively, recording scent memories and describing his dreams in vivid detail. Another began to teach origami, instructing other prisoners in absolute silence, as if words were unnecessary.

By day four, the prison nurse requested reassignment. She said she couldn’t focus. All she wanted to do was sit in the yard and listen to the wind.

Langston raised both hands at the monitor and said, “We’re losing our dataset. This is chaos.”

Wei smiled faintly. “This is evolution.”

Slowly, patterns emerged. The Basics were the most common, at least from this prison dataset. They moved slowly, completed chores without complaint, ate simple meals, and ignored all technology. Attuned inmates became subtly different. They spent long hours outdoors, gazed at the sky, or smelled the grass before lying in it. They didn’t speak unless necessary, but when they did, it was strange and poetic. “The bricks feel cooler today,” one said, laying a hand against the wall. “It’s like they’ve stopped arguing.”

Resistants remained unchanged, at least for a time. A few inmates still paced, still grumbled. But they were in the minority, and their tempers had softened, as if their anger was harder to hold.

During an observation, the doctors watched an Attuned inmate help a Basic inmate sort laundry. No words passed between them, but both nodded slowly, as if synchronized. A Resistant inmate nearby simply looked on, expression unreadable.

And then, there was Leland.

He wasn’t on the list. He had been given paperwork for his release, and walked through the mess hall during the release. The staff thought he’d been cleared. He hadn’t.

He was dosed with the same nasal mist as the others. Then, because of a clerical error and a paperwork shuffle, he was released twenty-four hours later on a scheduled parole. He never made the lists of either control or subjects.

No one noticed until the warden mentioned offhandedly, “That polite guy. Leland, I think? Didn’t cause any problems. Walked out of here yesterday. Kind of a shame. I think he was turning a corner.”

Wei, Bates, and Langston looked at each other in silence.

“No way to recall him?” Langston asked.

“Not without admitting he might be affected,” Bates said.

Wei added, “And if he’s contagious?”

Bates exhaled. “Then MIMs is already loose. Again.”

Outside the glass, two prisoners were folding paper birds while a third swept the corridor in perfect silence. An Attuned inmate was showing a Resistant how to sit still and smell the cypress oil from the floor cleaner, murmuring, “It’s better when you notice.”

Langston pointed without looking. “That one was in the control group.”

Wei said nothing. He just updated the spectrum chart and drew a new line.  


***Holdouts: unknown latency, full behavioral swing.***

Bates scanned a separate readout. “Wait. Has anyone here died of ELM since the testing began?”

They all went still.

Langston pulled up the integrated health feed. “Not one. Not a single case. Not even among the exposed population.”

“That prison should be a disaster zone,” Bates whispered. “ELM would’ve torn through it. Half of them should be dead already.”

Wei nodded slowly. “But they’re not. We saved them.”

There was a long silence.

Bates sat back, her voice quieter now. “This isn’t just containment anymore. We’re seeing something else. Maybe even something better.”

Langston didn’t argue. She only glanced at the updated behavioral charts. “We’re changing their brains. We said we wouldn’t, but we are.”

“No,” Wei said gently. “We’re revealing them. MIMs doesn’t rewrite, it remaps.”

For the first time, none of them looked away.

And in that moment, pride began to creep in. Not boastful. Not loud. But a quiet, persistent realization that they had saved lives. Even if the method was still unsettling.

Even if they didn’t fully understand what came next.

They forgot, for the moment, that they didn’t know where the prisoner Leland had gone, and they had no real idea what he carried.",1,1758460125.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

34W, 40M, 2 kids (twins, will be around 15 months). We both work in tech. 

Parameters: 

- Safety - accessible and responsive PD and hospital/ER within 10 min radius. We have BCBS PPO insurance. 
- cleanliness and parks - this is relative, but I’d like to take the kids for a stroll without worrying about the sidewalks/walking trails. 
- schooling - ideally a good public elementary school and a structured daycare or Montessori school within 10 min radius. even better if walking distance. 
- commute - I’ll be commuting to SF 1-2 times a week and my husband travels often. 30 min commute to SF and within 1 hour to SFO. 
 - walkable neighborhood - at a minimum being able to walk to get a coffee and to a nearby park. 
- community - ideally a place with families and kids. a weekend farmer’s market is a huge plus. 
- diversity - I’d love to live in a place where people of all backgrounds mix and the community is not homogeneous with a bit of diversity sprinkled in. 

We’d start by renting and are hoping for a 3/2 (or 2/2 that’s larger) around the $5000 range. 

Based on my research I’ve narrowed down to: 

- Alameda
- San Mateo 
- Sunset District, SF 
- Redwood City 

Would love suggestions on specific neighborhoods or additional places to consider. TYIA.

Each stop involved a spoken portion about the new edition and a large segment with public audience questions. The questions here mostly come from these portions, taken from eight different stops on the tour. 

(I gathered these at the time of the tour, but never really got around to doing anything with them until now, over two years later.)

The quotations have here been reordered and categorized into what I hope is a more readable format.

# Part Eleven - The Real World

**Montana**

> *I was a homeschooled kid who grew up in Montana in the 90s with basically no internet until the 2000s. We didn't even have television reception. My knowledge of the larger world, if you will, and other people, was limited to the books I read and the films I was lucky enough to see. I did the best I could at the time in terms of just trying to be open and inclusive, if you will. But I think I certainly know a lot more now than I did as a homeschooled kid in rural Montana. I'm trying to think of a nice and polite way to convey just how white and homogenous Montana was back then. I literally did not actually see an African American person in Montana until the late 2000s. That's kind of the environment it was. My dad had cousins from Kenya, so go figure. But they don't live in Montana.* [6]

> *I am from Montana and an entire year in Montana we only get about 13 to 14 inches of rain on average. I have a very curly beard and it doesn't like humidity. There's a reason I live in the north where it's dry and cold. I'm very happy being dry and cold. Although this past winter was a bit much for me. It was nine months of winter and it got down to minus 40. And if you scroll back in my Instagram, you'll see [a picture of me](https://x.com/paolini/status/1619874397493530624) after about four hours solid of shoveling snow and my beard is solid ice. I look like Santa Claus.* [7]

**Spirit Animals**

> **As a writer, what animal would be your mascot?**  
> *This one is more of an aspirational animal. It would be the capybara, because the capybaras are just the chillest animals in the world. Even the alligators won't bother them. They'll just go in the river, leave the capybaras alone. This is aspirational. I'm not like a capybara. But I'm aspiring.* [4]

**Pen Names**

> **Would you ever write under a pen name?**  
> *Who says I haven't? No, I haven't. I'm too much of an egotist and I don't write that fast so I don't have any extra books I can put out. Whatever I put out, I put out under my own name. If I were to use a pen name it would be some absolutely over the top name like Casanova Frankenstein or something.* [4]

> *Did you know that Robin Hobb is a pen name? And she also writes with the name Megan Lindholm. Did you know that's also a pen name? I'm not gonna tell you her real name though. [Margaret Ogden]* [4]

**Alternate Careers**

> **Before you became a famous author, what did you want to be when you grew up?**  
> *An artist. I started drawing before I started writing. Or a bladesmith. I built a couple of forges when I was a kid. But the biggest one was more along the lines of riding dragons and fighting monsters. And since that wasn't really a career option unless I joined the military, I wrote about it.* [6]

**Linguistics**

> *I'm not a linguist. Tolkien was. That was his profession, and he really was a master at it. You may have heard it said that he created Middle-earth to support the languages that he created. I always thought that was a bit of a joke until I got deeper into creating my own languages. You can create an artificial grammar and vocabulary and just invent a word according to the rules of your grammar. Simple enough. But if you really want to get into the weeds, so to speak, every word has a history, and that history is the history of the world you're writing in. As an example, there was a British Admiral [Edward Vernon] who was known for wearing a coat made of a certain woolen material that was known as grog [grogram]. So his men would refer to him as Old Grog. He also instituted the practice of giving men a daily ration of water and rum. So of course the sailors who were very appreciative of this started calling that their daily ration of grog. Which is how we get the drink grog. Well what happens if you drink too much grog? You get groggy. That's one word!* [7]

> *There is a word for ""bear"" that has been lost in the Indo-European languages, because bears were so powerful that you didn't want to speak their name because you might summon one or anger one. And so the word ""bear"" just means brown essentially. So it's ""the brown one"", but we don't actually say the name. We think it's related to the word Arthur. Arthur means bear. Arctic. So Arctic means ""place of bears"". Antarctic means ""no bears"".* [1]

**Marksman**

> **The dust jacket says you were a marksman in the Australian army?**  
> *There's a new bio on the back jacket flap of Fractal Noise that has some interesting parts. I wasn't in the Australian Army. I did qualify for marksmen in the Australian Army, however. I wasn't supposed to tell the story, but I think enough time has passed that no one's gonna get into trouble. So I was touring in 2012 for Inheritance, and I was going to Australia. So I emailed a friend of mine who's a fellow author and we have the same agent and he's from Australia, technically Tasmanian, and he's one of those people who has done everything. His name is Bradley Trevor-Grieve. Absolutely lovely, lovely person. I emailed him and I said, ""Look, I'm going to Australia. Do you have any recommendations for things to do?"" And he sent me this massive email with all these restaurants and beautiful places to see the seals and the birds and the trees and that. It was wonderful. So of course I wrote him back and I said, ""Awesome, thank you. Is there anything else a little more explosive I could do?"" And he just sent back this one line email, he said, ""Let me see what I can do.""* [4] *So when I was in Melbourne at five something in the morning, I got picked up by a military car that drove me way out into this rainforest jungle to a private house that I'm not going mention. And from there I was escorted to the military base outside of Melbourne and I was run through a whole gamut of tests where I was allowed to use all of the different small arms and large arms that Australian infantry uses. And on my very first try using the Australian Army's standard rifle, which is the Steyr AUG, I outshot the brigadier general and qualified for marksman, having never handled that rifle before.* [7] *He was a little miffed, but as he told me, ""If I ever have to draw my pistol in combat, something has gone seriously wrong. My job is to command the men who are doing the shooting."" So I hope that answers your question. To be clear, I have never served in any armed forces. But apparently I'm a bit of a marksman.* [4]

**Lifting**

> **I saw on your YouTube about your home gym. How much do you lift?**  
> *Not enough. I'm actually working for my 500 pound dead lift. Which I've wanted for a long time.* [1+]

**Sleeping**

> *My father is a night owl. All my life he has gone to bed between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. And he sleeps a full eight, nine hours. But that's his circadian rhythm. Apparently our children have inherited a somewhat similar trait from him. In the first year of life, they do not sleep.* [6]

**Fan Theories and Cosplay**

> **Do fan's reactions or theories ever influence how you story develops as you write later books?**  
> *Absolutely not. And there's a legal reason for that. I don't want to be looking at someone's fan fiction and then subconsciously taking that and using that in my own work. I am delighted that people theorize about my work and care about it and write fan fiction and bounce ideas around. I love knowing that people are doing that. But I try not to look at any of that.* [8]

> **You're vibing very Galbatorix today with the beard. Do you ever feel like dressing up or attuning to certain characters throughout your daily life?**  
> *Okay,  I'm definitely telling that to my wife. She's gonna love that observation. No, I never dress up as the characters. I just try to be the best version of myself. I've never really gone for cosplay or dressing up or anything like that. I admire those who do that, but that's never really been my thing. Usually I'm just dressed in sweatpants and a messy beard and a dit cap.* [6]

# Part Twelve - Touring

**Preparation**

> *It's always a process finding the right readings from a new book. ... I've got to find a way to shorten the reading [for Fractal Noise].* [2] *It's actually very hard to find a reading for that book that actually works as a reading* [7] *without spoiling anything or giving anything away.* [8]

> *Normally I would take a week or two to really work out a good presentation before I go on tour and I haven't had the chance to do that for Fractal Noise because I have been racing and working incredibly hard to meet some rather intense deadlines for my next book, Murtagh.* [10]

**Travel Fatigue**

> *Last night, the city of New York was kind enough as to start excavating the street outside my hotel room, at 3am. They managed to completely excavate it and patch it by about 6am, so credit to them, but I've been up all night.* [1]

> *...all the pictures of trains I took today because my two-year-old son loves trains.* [2]

> *After flying I get so dehydrated. It doesn't help that I only got four hours of sleep and I'm now chugging coffee like water. Tomorrow morning I have a flight at 9:50 in the morning. I fly from Tampa to Portland. And I still have an event tomorrow at 7pm, what will be 10pm here tomorrow. I'm actually going to double my coffee consumption tomorrow, I think that'll help. That or I'll just be a jittery mess.* [7]

> *I started today at 6am in Tampa. So it is now currently 10:00 at night for me, east coast time. And I've got two more stops after today, so my brain is mush.* [8]

> *This the last stop on my tour for this book. A couple of days ago, my publisher flew me from Tampa, Florida to Portland, and I had an event to do that day, and then from Portland to San Diego and San Diego to here. My brain doesn't know whether it's nighttime or daytime.* [10]

**Other Touring Stories**

> *I have at times woken up on book tour giving my presentation or woken up and found my hand signing the pillow next to my head.* [6]

> *I've definitely had some crazy events when I was touring for Inheritance. Probably one of the worst ones was in Berlin. They had me in this really old theater that was bombed during the war. The whole theater was filled and I was in the basement under the stage waiting for them to announce me. The only way to get up on the stage was this staircase, but it was really more like a ladder and it was so old that all of the wooden steps were dished out from all the feet that have gone up and down. They announced my name, and everyone's clapping, and you want to get on stage before they stop clapping, because then it's just horribly awkward. So I'm rushing up the steps as fast as I can, which was a mistake, and halfway up the ladder, my right foot slips off the edge of one of the steps. At full speed, full strength, I ram my shin against the edge of the step, stumble forward a step, and do it a second time. And so I dragged myself up, get out on the stage grinning through the pain. Fortunately for me, the event was being held with a translator and a presenter. So we were all sitting at this table on the stage. I'm sitting behind the table and after about three or four minutes, I'm thinking to myself, ""OK, I've banged my shin before. We all have. It hurts. But this really hurts."" And so while the presenter was talking, I look under the table and the whole front of my shin is soaked in blood, my sock is soaked in blood, and there's blood dripping onto the stage. So I nudge the translator next to me and I point under the table and go, ""hey, look"". He just goes white. And this very concerned German man leans into me and goes, ""Christopher, do we need to take you to the hospital?"" Honestly, I probably should have, but I said, ""no, no, we're gonna do this"". So I did an hour and half presentation. Then I signed books for every single person in that theater and no one noticed anything. My foreign publicist from Random House was touring with me. She was American, but she and her family are German. She grew up on a farm in upstate New York. This woman was eight months pregnant and touring with me and flying with me. This woman, she was strong, she could pull a plow. I'm very impressed with Jocelyn. She came to me at the end and said, ""Do we need to take you to the hospital now?"" And I said, ""no, I'm good, I can finish."" She said, ""Good, I knew you grew up in the country."" And then after I had to go back to my hotel and soak my leg in a tub to peel the pant leg off, and I had a dent like this deep down to the bone. And I still have a dent on my shin. So anyway, that's your gory story for the day. At least you know I'm going to stay here and sign books.* [6]


# Part Thirteen - Writing Advice

**Avoiding Infodumping**

> **How do you convey exposition and world building to readers without info dumping?**  
> *It's hard. It's a challenge. And conventions change over time. If you go back and read fantasy from the 80s, you'll find writers were doing things that are now not really allowed. No one's going to tell you not to do it. It's just people are a little savier. David Eddings in the 80s wrote his fantasy books and he'd start them with a prologue that would literally go, ""10,000 years ago, the gods created the world."" and proceeds from there. There are a couple of ways to approach it. My preferred way is that we learn about the world as the character learns about the world. Which is often the advantage of having a coming of age story, because then your character is growing up and learning about the world. It's hard to strike the balance and that's what your early readers are there to help you with because you know all about the world and the characters and you lose perspective. So have someone else look at it. I also find it easier to cut than add. Take the kitchen sink approach first draft and then second, third draft, you can trim down a little bit.* [2]

> **How do you decide what mysteries to resolve for the audience and what mysteries to leave unresolved?**  
> *I love teasing my readers, as you probably noticed. However, you can only do that to a certain point and then you have to have some payoffs. I like to leave enough mysteries that you can see the building blocks for the next story, but then I do want to pay it off for the next story. I always hated when I read large fantasy series when I was growing up, and the heroes save the world and kill the bad guy and everything is awesome. Then next book, there's some evil villain who's even worse than the one from the previous book, but we've never heard of him or her before, they just come out of nowhere. So I like to seed in and leave those foundations even early on. Sometimes I have to twist my editor's arm because if you don't know why that's there, it comes across like a useless scene. But I'm hoping now that I'm publishing books consistently again and writing and producing consistently that you're gonna be able to see some of the cool things I've had in mind for a long time.* [10]

**Omniscient narrator**

> *Omniscient narrator used to be very common, especially in fantasy. I kind of miss it. One of the advantages of an omniscient narrator from a technical standpoint is that when done well you can actually tell a larger story in less space. A lot of fantasy novels nowadays are big because the dominant point of view that's used is limited third person. There is a film camera that is looking through the eyes of the main character. Whatever the character sees, that camera sees. The observer feels what the character feels. But in limited third person, if the character has a tear that's running down their cheek, you can describe how it feels, you can describe the emotions driving it, but you can't describe how it looks, because you can't see your own cheek. It's third person, but it has the advantages of first person, making you feel very close to the character and you're sharing in their life. The downside is that it leaves very little room for the artificial narrator to do anything. You have to show everything, because otherwise it becomes very clear that there's artificial interruption that's coming from the author, not the character you're so closely joined with. Omniscient doesn't have that problem. I would love to see the comeback of that. I would love to try to write it myself, but I've been doing limited third person for so long, changing would definitely be an interesting exercise.* [4]

**Audience**

> **Did you find it was a big difference to jump from a young adult to more of an adult themed book?**  
> *No. I wrote The Inheritance Cycle as the best version of that story that I could write at the time I was writing it with the skills I had. It's YA because the character is under 18. That's literally the only classification the publishers use. Is the main character under 18? Alright, it's YA. Doesn't matter how much violence or whatever other things you have in there, it's YA. I think by the time it gets to the end of the series, Inheritance could very easily just be shelved in the regular adult fantasy section. As for these, no, I didn't find any big shift coming into adult. I used couple of naughty words here and there, but aside from that, the characters, whether in the YA or the adult are still taking their experiences seriously, because they're serious to them. And that's why I think readers care about it. I'm not making fun of it or taking it lightly no matter what. So I've got bad jokes and puns in my adult fiction and I've got epic battles in my YA fiction and I just try to tell the best version of the story each time.* [7]

> *The only time I really think about how I describe someone is when I'm writing something for a younger audience versus an older audience. If I'm aiming for younger, obviously I'm going to not have sex and violence to the degree I might in a Fractalverse novel, since those are adult novels. That really is the biggest concession. The same amount of work goes into a book meant for younger readers as older readers. All the same plotting, all the same character work, all the same world building. It's just, tonally, what is appropriate?* [4]

**Daily Routines**

> *I have to be physically comfortable to write. I can't have been sitting all day doing something else and then sit some more in the evening and try to write. I have to exercise. I have to move or I just can't write. I can't be sick, I can't be in a chair that makes my back ache or something. All those things are distractions. If there's any sort of personal drama in my life, which fortunately there isn't, but in the times when there have been, back in the days of dating, I can't write. It really does distract from the work, because the work is an imaginative process that I got into when I was happy as a kid. It was my daydreaming that led to the stories that I wrote. I find it hard to write if there's any sort of strife in my life. Which is unfortunate, because life often has strife, and in which case you have to just sit down and try to force your way through.* [7]

> *If I'm trying to plot the story or create the characters or worldbuild while writing, I'll often stall out. If a scene is not working, I may not consciously realize that, because I'm very strong willed. I know I have a plan, I'm sticking to my plan, I'm gonna keep writing my plan. But if it's not actually working, and it may not work for a number of reasons, it may be because the actual presentation of the scene lacks energy, it's not creating a reversal of some kind, there's no interest because things are being presented in a very flat manner or perhaps what's occurring is not suitable to the character's true nature, or I've just lost the thread in terms of the tone of the story and the writing is getting clunky. All of those are reasons why I might stall out and that just kills the writing. But the biggest thing is not knowing where I'm going and that includes on every level of the writing, from the characters' motivations to the events to the world building.* [4]

> **Does writing energize you or exhaust you?**  
> *It depends what phase we're in. If it's the telling the story for the first time phase, then it's energizing, especially if there's a good momentum going and if there aren't deadlines so intense that I have to work to the point of being burned out. If I can work a reasonable amount every day, and go exercise, spend time with my family, do other things, it's energizing, it's wonderful. It's still work, but a lot of fun. Once we get to the point of deadlines and once we get to the revisions of editing, then it's a real drain.* [4]

> **Do you have a favorite snack that helps energize you when you're writing?**  
> *I don't snack. I have coffee in the morning, and I have meals. Snacks will not sustain writing.* [4]

> **What is your ritual for getting in the creative mood of writing?**  
> *Depends where I am in the process. If I'm up against deadlines, there is no ritual. I sit down and try to work and work all day, work all night, work while you're on book tour. There is no off time. That's how you get burnout. If I am in a better cycle, like writing the first draft, then I get up in the morning, I grab a coffee, I attempt to read the entire internet, I always fail. I answer my emails. I usually take my son out. We go outside, spend some time in the sunlight, which is nice. And then I usually work pretty consistently through late morning to late afternoon. And then sometimes in the evenings. Although now I have family, I've discovered that evenings cannot be used for writing anymore because otherwise I never see my wife and that doesn't make her happy or me happy. I'm still actually figuring out how to write with a family. I think it's going to change also as the kids get older and are not waking up two to three times per night.*  
> **It doesn't go away.**  
> *Don't tell me that! I don't need it! No! Give me hope! Give me hope!* [10]

> *Having two kids in two years has completely changed my ideas of free time and energy. And I swear, all energy goes into the kids, right? And the parents are just left as staggering husks. They look at each other and go, ""We used to be young once. Do you remember when 10 at night was early? Now it feels like 3am"".* [7]

**Editing**

> *Find someone in your life who can help edit your work. Could be someone you hire, it could be a friend, family member. They need to be a good reader, they need to like the genre you're writing in, and they need to be able to give you feedback that is both accurate and constructive in the sense that it doesn't tear you down. Now, you, your job is to not be a fragile snowflake about it. It's important to realize that no one gets it right the first time. Not getting it right the first time is part of the process. As long as you're willing to fix it and put the work in and you have perhaps some guidance to help you understand where you put your foot wrong. Don't stress about it. That's the main thing. I used to stress about the fact that I had to revise at times. It's not worth it. The books turned out okay. That's all that really matters.* [7]

> *You can't fix what doesn't exist. That's why so many authors will tell aspiring writers to finish your first draft. Even if it's bad, you have to finish it because then you can fix it. Otherwise, it's just this theoretical thing in your brain.* [4]

**Getting Published**

> *I am not a good example for anyone to look at for how to get into publishing. And honestly, that's kind of true of a lot of authors because everyone takes a unique route into this industry. That also goes true for people who are actually agents, editors, and publicists. No one goes to school and majors in editing or publicity.* [2]


# Part Fourteen - Reading

**Books:**

**Reader's Block**

> **Have you ever gotten reader's block? Where you just couldn't bring yourself to read anything?**  
> *Absolutely. Usually when the books are just not interesting to me or too grim. There are a ton of books that are written about coming of age, what it means to go from being a child to an adult. Those appeal so broadly because it's something we all go through, or have gone through, or are going through, or will go through. But then once you're an adult, our lives go in all different directions. Maybe you get married, maybe you don't, maybe you go to college, maybe you don't, maybe you work in this profession or that profession. It became a lot harder to find stories that spoke to where I was at that stage of life. So I definitely went through a lull in reading, I'd say in my early 20s, where I was just like, ""what do I read?"" I don't feel like reading some literary novel about a 50-year-old depressed college professor who's cheating with a student. That's really not appealing to me and there's no dragons in it. But at the same time, I want to read about an adult, not necessarily a teenager. And that's not to say I don't enjoy Harry Potter or something these days. I do, but I think I look for different things out of books now than I did when I was younger. And that's the evolution we all go through as people and readers.* [4]

> *The biggest cause of reader's block are two adorable little kids. I haven't read a book in 9 months or so or longer. Also deadlines. I'm not reading as an author because I'm too busy writing and editing.* [4]

**Meeting Authors**

> **Do you have any writer friends that have inspired you?**  
> *Tad Williams inspired me, Raymond Feist inspired me, even Terry Brooks to a degree. Ursula K. LeGuin, quite a bit, although I never got a chance to actually meet her. Same for Anne McCaffrey.* [4]

> *I get to events with other authors. And that's a real treat, especially since I grew up reading lots of authors, so I get to go up to them and play fangirl for myself and say, ""Oh my God, I love your work! When's the next book coming out?""* [4]

**E.R. Eddison**

> *I really like the Worm Ouroboros by E.R. Eddison, which is pre-Tolkien fantasy written in a faux Jacobian language that took me three tries to get through and I recommend it to everyone and no one ever reads it. It has an extremely strange framing device you have to get past and then it's awesome. It basically reads like a ten-year-old's fantasy world that a 40-year-old wrote. But it's adult and bloody and awesome and epic and strange and I'm a big fan of it.* [10]

**J.R.R. Tolkien**

> **When you first started the writing the novel that would eventually become Eragon, how much did you have Tolkien in mind?**  
> *I would be lying if I said it wasn't quite a lot. Tolkien is the great giant of the fantasy genre. The Mount Fuji of fantasy. Also, I've read a lot of the sources that Tolkien read, and I drew a lot of the names for my characters from the Norse Edda. And I remember as I was flipping through the Eddas and I saw, ""oh, there's Gandalf"". Or, ""oh, they're the dwarves"". Unfortunately, there are only so many of these sources, that's it's all been mined bare by all of us fantasy writers. Tolkien was a huge inspiration. I definitely would not have been writing the fantasy I wrote without Tolkien.* [4]

> *Tolkien in The Hobbit is telling you a story. He even mentions locomotive steam engines in The Hobbit of all places. Nowadays that wouldn't be allowed because it breaks your suspension and disbelief.* [4]

> *I got to go to Oxford one time and see where Tolkien worked. That was a real treat.* [4]

**Roald Dahl**

> **How do you feel about the publishers who have been going back and editing Roald Dahl's books to remove offensive material?**  
> *I ended up on Sky News in Australia ranting about this. The short answer is it's abhorent. Don't do it. If something's offensive, let it be offensive. If something is offensive and we as a society decide we don't want to read it or it's no longer appropriate, okay then. But don't put words in someone else's mouth because that is the very opposite of free speech. It's the very opposite of liberalism and freedom. And especially as an author, I find it deeply offensive and troubling. They've done it to a number of authors out there. I think it's a very bad idea, and it's really only being done out of cowardice and greed. They want the books to continue to be read, and they're worried they're going to get cancelled because of something in some book. I get it, they want to sell books, but it's just not right. If you must do it, you have to make sure that the original editions are still available for publication. In the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory book the Oompa Loompas were not little orange men. I have an original copy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that my father had back when the Oompa Loompas were pygmies. And you know what? If you remove all the context, it actually works better than what he changed it to, just from strictly the writing standpoint. But he made those changes, and they work better when you include the context. That was Roald Dahl's choice. I support it, I applaud it, in fact that was Ursula K. Le Guin who got him to rethink what he had done and change that. Don't go change things after someone's dead. Otherwise, you can take something from someone who really is a horrible, objectionable person, completely whitewash their work, and then if you're in a kid and you don't know any better, you read the whitewashed version, you go around saying, ""I love so-and-so"", and then someone's gonna go, ""Really?"" That's a problem.* [4]

**Frank Herbert**

> *The book I have read more times than any other one is strangely enough Dune. I really like Dune.* [10]

**Anne McCaffrey**

> *Anne McCaffrey was kind enough to give me my very first blurb, which was absolutely lovely because I was writing about telepathic dragon riders and she had every right to be annoyed at me if she wanted to, but she was an absolutely lovely woman about it. I managed to kind of repay the favor by when I was touring in Spain one time for eldest I found out that her books were completely out of print in Spain and I talked about the Dragon Riders of Pern series so much in every interview I did in Spain that they reprinted all of her books because of that.* [4]

**Ursula K. Le Guin**

> *An example of an omniscient narrator that I think is well done would be A Wizard of Earthsea, especially the first one.* [4]

**C.J. Cherryh**

> *You can take [lack of exposition] to an extreme. There's a very well respected science fiction writer by the name of C.J. Cherryh. She writes in limited third person, which is the point of view I write, which essentially means that the movie camera, that is the narrator, only sees and feels what the main character sees and feels. However, she takes it to an extreme. I remember reading one of her books where you get halfway through the book before you learn that the main character's best friend is an alien. Because the main character has no reason to think about that particular fact. Similarly, one of the books, might have been the same one, the main character lives on a space station, and that's never mentioned until pretty late in the story for that same reason. Now I admire C.J. Cherryh's commitment to that. It's really admirable, she really sticks to her guns. But at the same time, it makes it difficult to read her books.* [2]

**Philip Pullman**

> **What is the first book to make you cry?**  
> *I don't cry for books. The only book that's even got me slightly close would be the end of the His Dark Materials trilogy. That's the only one that even got close. And I still didn't cry. So I'm sorry, does that look like a bad answer? I got a little mist in the eye. There are films that made me cry on occasion, but no books.* [4]

**Iain M. Banks**

> *There are people who write science fiction where the rules are made up and the points don't matter. As an example, Iain M. Banks, whose sci-fi I quite enjoy, his future physics is essentially completely made up. But it doesn't matter. It allowed him to tell the stories he wanted.* [1]

**Tad Williams**

> *I met Tad Williams many years ago, (trekking across the whole San Diego Comic Con). Tad wrote a wonderful trilogy called Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, which I highly recommend. And reading it is one of the things that really got me thinking about the origins of modern fantasy. It got me going back to read Beowulf and all sorts of myths and legends.* [4]

**Brandon Sanderson**

> *The Way of Kings is fantastic. I really enjoy it. But that's a ten book series. That's a big commitment. And each of those books is like 1,200 pages.* [7]

**Marie Brennan**

> *There is an author called Marie Brennan who wrote A Natural History of Dragons, among many other fun fantasy books. She trained as an anthropologist at Harvard. And in her spare time, she writes blog posts about world building. And she's collected those into two volumes. I was going to say I bought them, but that would be a lie. She gave them to me as a PDF. They're fantastic in terms of giving ideas for world building.* [7] 

**Nicholas Eames**

> *One I remember reading that's a little more modern, was Kings of the Wyld. The conceit is that it's a fantasy world where bands and mercenaries are treated like actual rock bands. And these guys are getting the band together to go rescue one of their daughters. It's an absolutely really fun book. That was a fun modern fantasy.* [4]

**Movies:**

**Star Wars**

> *If you think of the original Star Wars trilogy, if I asked you to describe or imagine Luke Skywalker's journey and arc, you could probably do a pretty good job of it. It's very easy to understand what his journey is in those original films. In the new films, if I asked you to do the same for Rey, it'd be a lot harder to conceptualize what was her journey. Because there were so many people involved in developing that story, it kind of went five different directions at once.* [8]

**Pacific Rim**

> *I love Pacific Rim. It's such a dumb film, it's so beautiful. But I'm sorry, humans are really good at killing things and especially giant squishy monsters. An M1 Abrams tank would probably take one of those down without any problem. We are really good at moving small things really fast and it's very hard to stop small things moving very fast.* [6]

**A Little Princess, and Miyazaki**

> *For a book to be interesting for me to read at this stage in my life, it has to be talking about something deeper than just running around and hacking monsters. There are lots of books that talk about surface things. At this point, it's nice to have stories that talk about deeper things, and deeper does not mean depressing, necessarily. There's actually a lovely movie from the 90s called A Little Princess. That's a deeper story. So are some of Miyazaki's films, like My Neighbor Totoro or Spirited Away. Not depressing films in the slightest, but they deal with lots of deep issues. So that I find much more interesting.* [4]

**Video Games:**

**Mass Effect**

> **What's your favorite Mass Effect game?**  
> *Two. I actually know Drew Karpyshyn. He was the lead writer on the first two games and then they kinda kicked him off for the third one and it shows. So I really love the second one. I love what they did with Shepard's character between the two games. And I think the second one just builds on the first one. It's pretty awesome.* [10]

**Minecraft**

> *I am a technical Minecraft player. Go to my YouTube channel, dude, you have to see my storage system. I have an automated storage system that holds every item in the game. I have a death ray cannon that kills the ender dragon in one shot. I have books to write and I don't have time to play Minecraft for ages. I gotta mine a bunch of blocks? No, I build a quarry machine that mines the blocks for me. The problem is I spend more time building the machine than digging would take.* [2]

**Far Cry 5**

> *If any of you want to know what it looks like where I live, play Far Cry 5. I probably shouldn't say this, but as ridiculous as that game is, it's more true to life to the people I know in Montana, including the cultists. There's a guy [in the game] who lives by the airport who believes in aliens and crop circles. Look, I'm not gonna say that my grandfather was once interviewed on the Discovery Channel about a UFO he once saw, or that he owned the airport in the valley where I live, but he did and he did. He also claimed he saw pterodactyl on Papua New Guinea during World War II. He also married two of his high school teachers. Two! I mean, at a certain point it's becoming a habit. He had a crazy life.* [2]",1,1758459669.0,Eragon,1,1.0,False

1nmrafu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/1nmrafu/potential_marriage_breakdown/,Potential marriage breakdown,"Im writing this because I feel like I have no one in my personal life that I can reach out too. I know its easy to devolve into people bashing but please can you keep any opinions and advice constructive.

Im going to start with a little background to build context. Obviously there is always two sides to a story and this is just mine but just writing this down is helping me get it off my chest a little.

I am the M37, personally im quite introverted and shy but not completely underconfident. My wife F32 is quite outgoing, happy to chat to anyone. We met online in 2016, when we met we hit it off quite well. My situation at the time was that I was in full time employment in the military (it was a job, and I needed one during the recession) so we were located quite far apart. She was working and also training to become a sparky.

One thing I need to make clear was that this was my first serious relationship I didn't really date when younger partly due to been introverted so I never really got the life lessons from previous experience but I've always been very chill and go with the flow.

My wife was at the time was still living with an ex partner, she claimed he was abusive but she couldn't move out just yet. I never questioned anything she said I took it at face value. My memory is a little hazy over the timeline but our relationship progressed and we got engaged i realise this was quick but I had found the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

I had met her parents quite a few times and they liked me, and because we were engaged they let my wife move back in with them until we got a house (through my work, we could rent if married) looking back this was a first red flag if my daughter was in a relationship they would be out and back home ASAP regardless. So now I've started to question what the truth actually was.

At the time i was learning to drive and didnt have a car yet. I helped move what I could out of her old place back to her parents by hand but that was limited by time of from work and the distance to her parents. Around this time my wife bumped into an old friend as she states he had a car so helped her move the larger and heavy items. They started hanging out alot and went out drinking. I didnt think anything off it after all I grew up with female friends that I went out drinking with as well and male.

I quickly learnt however my wife's choice of friends or ability to see their intent was either completely off or she liked the attention and this will become apparent throughout. I found out she was basically sending this guy the same pics she was sending me and he was asking her to come around to his for netflix and chill. When I realised this I was completely numb it went against every core view in my opinion for how someone should behave in a relationship. I didnt know how to communicate this however so I started to become suspicious of every guy innocent or not. When I talked to her about it she claimed to have just been using him for the car and she didnt realise what he meant by netflix and chill. In my ignorance and wanting to hold onto what I had I believed her.

As you may have guessed my wife makes friends with guy and struggles to keep any friendship going with females and thats perfectly fine shes entitled to be friends with whoever and thats how I saw it but the problems kept re-happening. This leads onto her ex boss, I mentioned she was training to become a sparky. This was an apprentice to someone I met the guy a couple of times first time he all went for a night out and he was pissed. He acted weird but I thought it was just the alcohol, then I met him sober and I had alarm bells going off in my head. The way he looked at my wife was predatory is the only way I can describe it he was in his 50s she was early 20s. I tried raising my concerns but she ignored me and said I was been daft.

A few weeks later he tells her they're going to Blackpool for a job. Turns out there was no job he had booked a hotel and was taking her on a mini break away. In the hotel room my wife found out his bags were full of drugs and sex toys. I do actually believe her side of events in this case because she phoned me asking for help the police were called and he was arrested and I could here in the background the hotel staff helping to keep her away from him. This is just the example of how she either could not read someone's intent or likes the attention but then backed out.

You can sort of imagine my feelings with not been able to help but then also the whole trust issue and been paranoid over any guy that came into the picture.

Anyway fast forward we get married and relocate for my job. She's now unemployed so to better herself she started doing a degree i was fully supportive. I could cover the cost of rent and all expenses and it gave her something to do. Shortly after we relocated however I was due to get deployed for 4 months to the other side of the world. I introduced her to my friends in work and suggested that she could go to the bar and drink with them as she didnt know anyone. She also started going to the gym, this is where someone approached her and she sort of made friends. I didnt know the person but she said they were alright and she didnt really have any friends so it didnt bother me. Then it got weird again, this person got obsessed with my wife they would text and ring hundreds of times and even drove around to where we lived and watched the house from the car. I dont know what my wife text him or said to him so either she led him on or shes just always unlucky but it was becoming a common theme. The police had to get involved again before anything got sorted.

So imagine how this made me feel helpless on the other side of the world. I became paranoid I wanted to believe everything she said but part of me was thinking she was cause of each problem.

She started working in a pub and we had almost the exact same scenario some guy because obsessed we even had letters sent to our house addressed to me saying he was having an affair with my wife.

She made friends with the locals she would go out and take the dogs for a walk with one of them and became close friends again this is while im deployed so its like shes reaching out to people. I start getting told by work colleagues they've over heard the guy bragging that he could sleep with my wife if he wanted to in the pub. We have a unique surname so it couldn't have been anyone else.

By this time im struggling to cope I still love her but all these issues were literally making me paranoid to the point where I wanted to check her phone. Like I said earlier first real relationship and I didnt know how to communicate my feelings to her. 

Then i knew something was wrong a major gut feeling so I did check her phone and I realised she had being having an affair everything clicked into place and my world literally fell apart on the inside. I couldn't speak to my parents through fear of failure I was blaming myself I thought I had done something wrong. I couldn't speak to her parents because I didnt want them to blow up on her. I tried confronting her over everything and well honestly I cannot remember much from that point I think my mind had literally blanked details as a coping mechanism. I just remember her blaming alot of it on me for been controlling alot of thay stems from thr experiences from the relationship in my opinion because that was never me as a person beforehand.

You might be laughing at this point or just feel sorry for me or her but I didnt want to face failure in marriage so i forgave her and wanted to move on. We moved location and I mentally cut off everything that happened from that area. I felt used and hurt but wanted to make it work.

Fast forward a few years I think were in a better place, she was still in contact with one person at the previous location the guy who bragged in the pub but I had been pounded so much by the accusation of being controlling I didnt feel like I could say anything. 

She manages to get into the military so shes at cranwell for training. She instantly changes, it honestly felt like I had been used as a mug just providing a house for her to live she gets a better paid job can be self sufficient and would now ditch me to move on thats how it felt personally. She started drinking alot which in the military going for nights out isn't uncommon nor did I have any issue with it but the same old problem re emerged one person got super obsessed with her again and began going to far. Im not going into detail but it had to get reported in the end. All this made me paranoid again as you might expect it took a major toll on the relationship and she wanted to take a break from it. 

My mental health dropped to the lowest point where I actually became suicidal. I had no one to talk to and I reached breaking point and I finally broke in work. I did thankfully have a very supportive boss and received all the help I needed. To be fair to my wife after what happened she dropped out from that job and came back to support me. I had some councilling and felt better getting most things off my chest.

However, I still had that burning pain of not wanting to give up on the marriage. The situation brought us closer together in a weird way and we were happy again. I did want to do marriage councilling together at this point to work on the relationship but my wife was against it. 

Fast forward a year I think were in a good place and we got pregnant. Your probably reading this now and going your a fucking idiot and maybe you're right. But I had always wanted a family i thought we would both in a good place and we were generally looking forward to it.

Despite what you might think so far my wife is a good mum. We both stopped drinking and she stopped smoking the moment she found out. For anyone that has kids you know how hard it can be but through work I was able to get alot of time off including working half days at no pay reduction. I literally love been a dad my boy means everything to me, I did all the night feeds changed every nappy. I would spend every second and every penny I had to provide anything he needed alongside proving for the family as a whole. 

We made a future plan as well, again I was fully supporting the family my wife was doing her masters degree online and I had started a degree online as well for a future job outside of the military. My wife then fell pregnant again, she wanted two children close in age which i was fine with as I stated I always wanted a family.

Now you can maybe imagine the pressure involved here. I earn around 40k, I pay for everything the house,  all bills, food ect and everything the boys need. We also have two dogs and cats. Money as you might expect was tight, living pay check to pay check. I was starting to get stressed because he had consecutive months of over spending which wasnt viable. 

Once the second boy was born I loved him just as much as the first. Theres different types of love in this world and I would lay my life down in a second for them they mean the world to me. I managed to get 6 months off work full pay to help raise the children and support my wife. But my priority changed i was hyper focused on doing everything for the boys becauce my dad was never that involved and things like the animals I started to see as a hindrance when it came to it financially.

So my current situation im back at work still supporting everything. We have two babies under two both of use are doing a degree at the same time and we have financial pressure. You can see how stressful the situation is but I only saw it as temporary we had a plan and were going to get through it. I have made mistakes I think I neglected my wife I focused on the boys but I didnt think there was anything wrong i was trying to so my best for the family. 

However, a few weeks ago my wife said shes had enough apparently ive changed (complained about the animals) and the relationship has suffered because I haven't made her feel like I love her anymore I've neglected her and were basically like roommates. I tried to explain the situation were in is stressful and my love for her hasn't changed I just struggle to show it in the way she wants maybe but some days im literally running on coffee. 

It then turned out she had been speaking to some person in America that she knew 10 years ago. Turns out in two weeks shes fallen in love with him and wanted to move to the states and do cattle ranching to make money. You literally couldn't make this up. She was under the impression I would just let her up and leave with the boys without complaint. Thankfully im doing a law degree and want to specialise in family law as a solicitor so I know that this is very improbable that the courts would decide thats in the best interest of the children.

In every problem we have had every situation, I have been persuaded not to speak to my family because they will just hate her. Don't speak to her family because they will just side with you. I haven't been able to speak to friends out of shame and everytime she plays the victim card somehow making me feel responsible for her out actions. I know i have struggled with communication in this relationship and I will have played a part in whats gone wrong I fully admit I've just focused on the boys and neglected other areas I just wanted to be a good dad. She has since after realising she would lose the fight to go to America decided we can try councilling. But my fears are that as much as I want this to work and raise the boys in a happy family unit. She will just blow up in a different way sometime down the line. 

What would you do in this situation? My gut is telling me I need to protect myself and the boys now. Despite how painful that might be.

If youve read this all the way to the end i appreciate it please keep any comment constructive shes still my wife and I love her I know im in the wrong as well I just wanted this to all work.

1nmr7py,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoFiSongwriting/comments/1nmr7py/10_wichtigsten_akkorde_für_lofi_beats_mit_midi/,10 wichtigsten Akkorde für Lo-Fi Beats – mit MIDI Tipps & warum sie funktionieren,"Hey Lo-Fi Crew,  
  
ich habe gemerkt, dass ich beim Produzieren immer wieder zu denselben **Akkorden & Voicings** greife. Lo-Fi lebt von **warmer, jazzy Harmonie**, und dafür braucht man kein Musikstudium. Hier eine kleine Übersicht der **10 wichtigsten Akkorde**, die fast in jedem Lo-Fi Track funktionieren – plus **warum gerade diese Akkorde** so gut klingen.

# Die Akkorde & warum sie funktionieren

1. **Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B)** → klingt offen, warm, friedlich. → typischer „Startpunkt“ in Lo-Fi, perfekt für Intro oder Outro.
2. **Am7 (A–C–E–G)** → melancholisch, mellow. → Lo-Fi lebt von Nostalgie – dieser Akkord klingt sofort nach „Rückblick“.
3. **Dm7 (D–F–A–C)** → weich, introspektiv. → ideal als „Zwischenstation“ für sanfte Übergänge.
4. **G7 (G–B–D–F)** → baut Spannung auf, will zurück zu Cmaj7. → sorgt dafür, dass sich ein Loop rund anfühlt.
5. **Em7 (E–G–B–D)** → dreamy, leicht schwebend. → super für Momente, die entspannt, aber nicht zu fröhlich klingen sollen.
6. **Fmaj7 (F–A–C–E)** → hell, aber nicht kitschig. → bringt positive Vibes in einen sonst melancholischen Loop.
7. **Bm7b5 (B–D–F–A)** → leicht düster, typisch Jazz. → gibt deinem Beat eine kleine „unerwartete Wendung“.
8. **E7 (E–G#–B–D)** → bluesig, lebendig. → gut als Kontrastakkord, wenn ein Loop sonst zu „flach“ klingt.
9. **Asus2 (A–B–E)** → minimalistisch, offen. → super für Loops, die viel Raum für Atmosphäre (Regen, Field Recordings) lassen.
10. **D9 (D–F#–A–C–E)** → sehr jazzy & soulful. → bringt sofort den typischen „Coffee Shop“-Lo-Fi Sound.

# 🎹 So baust du die Akkorde in der DAW nach

* **Piano Roll öffnen** → Grundton setzen (z. B. C).
* Terz + Quinte hinzufügen → E + G.
   1. oder 9. dazu → B oder D.
* **Voicing variieren**:
   * Grundton eine Oktave tiefer.
   * obere Noten weglassen oder doppeln.
   * Noten leicht versetzt einzeichnen (kein perfekter Block).

Lo-Fi lebt davon, dass Akkorde **menschlich & unperfekt** klingen.

#  Beispiel-Progression (typisch Lo-Fi)

Cmaj7 → Am7 → Dm7 → G7  
= eine klassische Jazz-Kadenz, die extrem smooth und „vollständig“ klingt.

 Als 8-Takte-Loop gespielt, klingt das schon wie ein fertiger Lo-Fi Beat.

# Mein Tipp:

* Diese Akkorde sind **warm, jazzy & entspannt** → genau das, was Lo-Fi ausmacht
* Lassen viel Platz für **Atmosphäre & Field Recordings in euren Tracks**.
* Mit nur 10 Akkorden kannst du schon *unendlich viele Loops* bauen.

1nmr6r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1nmr6r0/stop_using_dopamine_hacks_and_start_building/,Stop using dopamine hacks and start building serotonin habits - tips I learned from Huberman Lab,"I’ve tried pretty much every focus hack out there, Pomodoro timers, Habitica, giving myself candy after each task. It all works for like... a day. Then it fizzles. The common thread? They all rely on dopamine rewards. And if you’ve got ADHD like I do, dopamine doesn’t hit the same way. You either get bored fast or the “reward” loses its meaning entirely.

That’s why I’ve started shifting toward serotonin-based incentives. Instead of chasing a high, I try to make the act of working itself feel safe, cozy, and steady. I build an atmosphere I want to return to. For me, that’s black coffee in a warm mug, lo-fi jazz humming in the background, a soft blanket over my legs, a candle flickering, and a desk I use for nothing else. Sometimes I’ll throw in a tiny piece of white chocolate just because. It’s not about stimulation, it’s about association. My brain started linking those calm vibes with deep focus. And it’s been a game changer.

I started researching this after hearing Andrew Huberman talk about dopamine on his podcast. Turns out dopamine isn’t about pleasure, it’s about pursuit. Neuroscientist Kent Berridge broke it down in his research: dopamine spikes when you’re chasing a reward, not enjoying it. You can want something a lot and still not like it once you get it. That hit hard. I realized most of my productivity systems were built on dopamine “chasing”... and that’s why I always crashed.

Wolfram Schultz mapped how dopamine responds to surprise, when something’s better than expected, your brain floods with dopamine. But once a reward becomes predictable, the hit disappears. So if your “reward” is always the same, say, a cookie after a task, your brain stops caring. That’s why gamified apps work at first and then start to feel empty. Especially if you’re ADHD and already burned out by novelty loss.

Then I found studies by Miyazaki and Crockett on serotonin. This stuff hit different. Serotonin helps you wait for rewards. It makes your brain more okay with not getting instant results. One paper showed how activating serotonin neurons made animals stay patient for longer-term rewards. Another study found that serotonin actually boosts prosocial behavior, people became more averse to harming others and more inclined to cooperate. Basically: serotonin helps you slow down, care more, and stick with things.

That’s when I realized my “cozy vibe setup” wasn’t just a mood, it was building a serotonin loop. Calm environment = more patience = deeper work = more motivation. I wasn’t chasing a prize, I was training my brain to feel good while doing hard things. And that made it easier to return to those tasks the next day. It wasn’t hype, it was harmony.

I also finally read Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna . She’s a Stanford psychiatrist who explains how overusing dopamine leads to a “pain-pleasure seesaw” that messes up your baseline motivation. This book is honestly one of the best things I’ve ever read about why modern life feels so addictive. It explains everything from tech addiction to burnout in a way that’s scary accurate. This book will make you rethink how you chase rewards. Insanely good read.

One podcast episode I keep revisiting is  “Controlling Your Dopamine.” He explains how multitasking, like stacking music, snacks, and social media while working, actually lowers your dopamine baseline over time. You feel good now, but worse tomorrow. He shares simple protocols to avoid dopamine burnout while staying motivated. That episode changed how I approach my entire workday. The real shift came when I started collecting tools that helped reinforce that serotonin-state. A friend who listens to every episode of  Lab put me on . It’s an ai personalized learning app built by a team from columbia university. It turns top books, expert talks, and brain science into short podcast episodes tailored to your goals. You can pick how deep you want to go, 10, 20, or 40 minutes. And you can pick your host’s voice. I went with this smoky, sassy voice that sounds like Samantha from Her. It learns what you’re into and updates your learning path over time. One episode connected the dots between Miyazaki’s serotonin research,  dopamine science, and Dopamine Nation, and it gave me unexpected insights that completely changed how I approach focus. 

Someone on  recommended The Molecule of More by Daniel Lieberman, and I’m glad I listened. This book explains how dopamine shapes our politics, creativity, relationships, and focus. It’s not just for science nerds, it’s engaging and reads like a thriller. This book will make you question every impulsive decision you’ve ever made. It helped me realize I wasn’t lazy, I was wired for dopamine chaos.

I also tried [Brain.fm](http://Brain.fm), which plays neural-phase-locking sound to help you focus. It’s not music, it’s science-based audio that gently nudges your brain into a flow state. I started using it during my serotonin-vibe desk sessions, and it helps me stay on task without feeling overstimulated. Way better than lo-fi  loops for me.

And yeah, none of this would’ve stuck if I wasn’t reading daily. Reading rewired how I think about thinking. It gave me language for the mess in my head. It gave me frameworks to fix it. That’s why I’ve been making time to read or listen to something smart every day, books, podcasts, whatever. But especially books. The kind that take you deeper. The kind that make you ask better questions.

Not saying I’ve fixed motivation forever. But I stopped relying on dopamine bribes. I stopped fighting myself to get things done. I just made the process feel good. And that serotonin shift? It gave me back my focus.

I unfortunately have to drink decaf now however I used to use Artisan Roast in Edinburgh. I like their range (swiss water decaf from Brazil and their la serriana). Looking for something that could blow me away. Something new that would shine with dairy I.e a good cortado. Or should I stick to what I love?.

I tried the decaf from Exhale but there was absolutely zero aroma from the beans and the coffee itself was really bland almost stale so I wasn't impressed. 

I have ordered some from Origin Coffee (Atlas) but they are more expensive than my usual.

Also been looking into 

Pact decaf house blend

Pact el paraiso

WBR Simmer down decaf

The Little Coffee Company decaf
decaf

KOTA decaf range 

Thank you 😊

Extremely emotionally immature, abusive. Generations of it. They don't think the feelings of other people ""are real"".

The other day, I was in a (very) small-town coffee shop and heard the owner saying loudly to a customer ""I don't have any emotions. I don't feel anything. The army does that to you, I think."" she said she served in the 70s and 80s and said it was good to be that way, because after you shot a ""target in the field"" what good was crying over the body? And she laughed. She obviously seemed proud of this ""skill"" to not feel anything and then said how much she enjoyed seeing Europe as a benefit of having enlisted. She was a gray-haired grandmother-looking woman with a hitch in her walk, probably in her late 70s or maybe early 80s.

She doesn't feel anything? Fine. I don't care if her soul is a cold, un-feeling void. That is for her to contend with.  
  
But she thinks *others* don't (or shouldn't) feel anything either, and that it's perfectly fine for her to put her lack of emotions to use against others. That because she doesn't feel any remorse, the pain and suffering she causes others doesn't matter. It matters to them, only she doesn't care. You see, because she is so wonderfully ""without emotions"". At least, she thinks she is. Something terrible has been done to her to make her this way and to think it's a good thing. Much less brag about it.

It all works for like... a day. Then it fizzles. The common thread? They all rely on dopamine rewards. And if you’ve got ADHD like I do, dopamine doesn’t hit the same way. You either get bored fast or the “reward” loses its meaning entirely.

That’s why I’ve started shifting toward serotonin-based incentives. Instead of chasing a high, I try to make the act of working itself feel safe, cozy, and steady. I build an atmosphere I want to return to. For me, that’s black coffee in a warm mug, lo-fi jazz humming in the background, a soft blanket over my legs, a candle flickering, and a desk I use for nothing else. Sometimes I’ll throw in a tiny piece of white chocolate just because. It’s not about stimulation, it’s about association. My brain started linking those calm vibes with deep focus. And it’s been a game changer.

I started researching this after hearing  Huberman talk about dopamine on his podcast. Turns out dopamine isn’t about pleasure, it’s about pursuit. Neuroscientist Kent Berridge broke it down in his research: dopamine spikes when you’re chasing a reward, not enjoying it. You can want something a lot and still not like it once you get it. That hit hard. I realized most of my productivity systems were built on dopamine “chasing”... and that’s why I always crashed.

Wolfram Schultz mapped how dopamine responds to surprise, when something’s better than expected, your brain floods with dopamine. But once a reward becomes predictable, the hit disappears. So if your “reward” is always the same, say, a cookie after a task, your brain stops caring. That’s why gamified apps work at first and then start to feel empty. Especially if you’re ADHD and already burned out by novelty loss.

Then I found studies by Miyazaki and Crockett on serotonin. This stuff hit different. Serotonin helps you wait for rewards. It makes your brain more okay with not getting instant results. One paper showed how activating serotonin neurons made animals stay patient for longer-term rewards. Another study found that serotonin actually boosts prosocial behavior, people became more averse to harming others and more inclined to cooperate.

After a few hours, one of the Turian workers enters the Normandy and heads to the cockpit to give a status report. As he is speaking with Joker, EDI walks into the cockpit to listen. When he sees her, he says, “hey there, can I get a coffee, little cream and sugar?”

EDI chuckles. “I am not your personal AI assistant. Make the coffee yourself.”

He raises his eyebrows and turns back to Joker. “You know, they say the first sign of an AI rebellion is when your coffee maker stops taking orders and starts giving them.”

EDI scowls, pulls out her M-6 Carniflex pistol, and shoots him between the eyes.

Joker gasps.

Before the Turian even drops to the ground, EDI holsters her pistol and catches him. She carries him out to a scrap metal bin and dumps his body, dusting off her hands afterward. When she returns to the cockpit, Joker’s mouth is still open in shock. She just stands there, looking at him inquisitively, until he finally speaks.

“EDI, *what the Hell*!?”

I was in so much pain that every 5-10 minutes I was crying and couldn’t focus on breathing. You saw me unable to sleep for 4 days straight, throwing up from that pain. It put me in the hospital and they told me if I went another day without going I would of most likely died. Yet because you were hurting and I was unable to see it since I had to focus on myself, you questioned your feelings for me. Told me you weren’t worried about me because you knew I’d survive. The 3 amazing years as best friends prior to getting together, and the 3 perfect years we had together as a couple, flushed down the drain supposedly just because I wasn’t there to help support you for a week. 

You distanced yourself for a month and a half, you refused to talk to me, you refused to tell me what was wrong, you cut off affection and you didn’t want to do anything with me at all. All you wanted to do was go drinking with your friends, and I asked you 2 different times if you were okay, if something was wrong and how I was worried about you, you told me you were just having fun with your friends. I trusted and believed in you because I love you, you’ve always gone through small phases of needing your own space and time to do your own stuff, so I believed that’s all this was, especially since that’s what you told me. Why didn’t you tell me then that you were questioning your feelings? Why did you have to prolong it and put me through so much pain for that month and a half? Why did you have to wait until right after we renewed our lease for a year to end it, when I’d be trapped here with you? I can’t get out of here without your signature yet you won’t let me leave, why do you want me to suffer so badly? I spent so many of those nights anxious and jealous for the first time in my life, confused, somewhat angry, and so, so hurt. I didn’t know how to feel because the person that I cared for more than anything was completely pushing me away and I had no idea why. Any time I got to see you and tried to address any of this, you just ignored me and shut me out.

You told me all the tiny reasons you fell out of love with me, yet it was all so minimal, and could of easily been addressed by talking about it. How was I supposed to know about the problems that I wasn’t even aware we were having, without communicating that you felt that way? You never mentioned any of it once, it’s impossible for me to read your mind, but I damn well would of done anything to make you happy and at ease, I already have. I sacrificed and pushed away all of the love and care I needed to show myself for you to be happy, because nothing made me happier.  I regularly walked close to an hour just see you at work, even when
I had things to do not long after. I paid attention to the littlest things you mentioned once and bought you them in secret just to surprise you, even when I had next to money left but you wanted something, I’d get it and figure out how I was supposed to eat the next couple days later. I’m not an attentive person, yet things you’ve said once stuck with me years later that I’ve made sure to make important to me, because it came from you. Every thing I ever did in my life was for you, and you told me after you left me that none of that sacrifice ever mattered to you.

 You told me when you ended it that we were just taking a break so you could figure out how you felt. After you came back from the expensive trip you had spent all of your money on and forced me into fully paying rent for 3 months, you’d tell me the answer on if you wanted to keep trying or not. I realized in only 2 days there was no break, that you just wanted to protect yourself from feeling guilty, because you always run away from your problems and have never faced them. 

I feel so isolated and lonely in this apartment, I understand you wouldn’t of been able to afford moving out on your own when you started to question your feelings, but why did it have to come at the cost of my own feelings? Im trying so hard to save up so I can get out of here so I can heal, but its horrifying knowing once I’d move out, I’m never going to see you again. I’m struggling so much to heal and to try and live my life without you when you’re right there in that other room. I can’t stop wanting to go talk to you, to enjoy the things we always did together, to stay up late every single night talking. I miss hearing about every little thing that happened in your day, hearing about the things you wanted to do, seeing you be silly, hearing the new music you always  found, pretending to fall asleep when you’d get tired so I could tuck you in and made sure you had water since you woke up every night thirsty, to be able to hold you at night and kiss you on the forehead every morning when we wake up. 

You keep trying to use me for my money and kindness further. I gave you so much money for that trip, and when you found out I had extra money in savings you tried asking for more, even when we were broken up. You’ve tried guilt tripping me into walking down the street to pick up your coffee order, to buy you food because you decided to put yourself in debt with that trip. You asked for more money since what you used for your trip was just to keep yourself out of the negative, when I gave more than I should of. You’re trying to force me into paying this months rent in full and buy food for your cats since you’re in debt. You’ve hardly even taken care of the cats that I told you I didn’t want to adopt, but gave in so you’d be happy. I’m the one who has to feed, water, buy their supplies, yet you told me one of the reasons you fell out of love with me is there’d be times you’d ask me to scoop their litter after working 10 hour days and forget to for a couple days? Why couldn’t you do it yourself?

You told me when we broke up that you wanted to be friends still, and a part of me believed that. We were still talking like nothing happened in a sense, joking and bantering like we did every day. I’ve tried talking a couple times to you, yet you clearly don’t want anything to do with me. Whenever I’ve made progress to distance myself, you come back and talk to me, to involve yourself in my life just enough to give me false hope that I can see my best friend again. You told me a week ago that I can talk to you about whatever, that you DO want to be friends, yet I was drunk that night, it was a month of being apart and that hurt a lot. I said I’d love to the next night since you’d be off work, but you had your friend spend the night, and then acted so uninterested and as if you were waiting for me to leave you alone the next day when I tried to talk to you. I’ve tried seeing if you wanted to do anything simple together, yet you suddenly get plans or make excuses why you can’t, but later say we can do something together. 

I hate how you didn’t grieve at all, you didn’t stop to care or think about everything we’ve gone through. You just shoved me away and didn’t give me a chance to talk at all. You told your friends and family all these awful things about me that aren’t true, that I’ve only overheard when you loudly talk on the phone to them about me. Or how you bought pregnancy tests when we hadn’t done anything for a long time, and played it off that it was for your best friend, although you were keeping it on the back of your bed, thinking I’d be stupid enough to believe that lie. The other night you were talking on the phone about how one of the people you were drinking with, you’ve been sleeping with, and how you’re starting to like them. I don’t even know what to believe anymore, if you were sleeping with them while we dated, is that why you left me? Did you just get bored of me one day and decide to move onto the next? Everyone in my life during that month and a half was telling me about how toxic it seemed, how they were worried you were cheating, yet I didn’t want to listen because I love you so much and I didn’t think you could ever hurt me like that. 

After all of this, I still love you, I know I shouldn’t but deep down I have a gut feeling I’ll always feel love for you one way or another. I don’t think I could ever take you back after everything you did to me, even if I’d want to. I know that I’m being immature about this all, it’s obvious how bad you were for me, you were manipulative, controlling, mentally abusive and unappreciative. I just don’t know how I’m supposed to live my life without my best friend apart of it. ",1,1758458968.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

This is for a YouTube Channel (basically the content is narrated stories with static images and drawing). Is a 3 chapter creepypasta about an aquatic alien species that takes over earth oceans. The style and aesthetics of the channel are set in the 90’s. I have little idea how the world was back then, so anything that could be added or subtracted to better set the story into that timeframe is welcomed.** 

\-----------------------

**PART I: THE SHORELINE**

The road had been empty for miles. Red signs warned that the ocean was approaching; beyond them the air tasted faintly of salt. She parked in the coastal town and climbed out. It felt long abandoned: chipped paint, nets piled like dead nests, a rusted boat still chained to the pylons where it had run aground.

The coastline had been receding for twenty years and the harbor looked as if someone had ripped it out of the water. Far down the sand an old man stood and waved. 

At first she thought the body in the surf was driftwood matted with algae; from a distance the sea makes things familiar. As she drew nearer the shape grew stranger with every step: swollen like deep-sea life dragged into the shallows. Black eyes bulged, rimmed in red. Its skin, hard and oily, reflected dark blue hues from the tide. 

Sea gulls had already claimed places around the mouth; some birds lay near, still twitching. Poisoned by alien flesh.

“I found it this morning when I was walking,” the man said. 

“You come to the beach?” Asked Helen.

“Yeah. Sometimes I fish.” She watched him, and the town that crouched, abandoned, behind him. 

“Your neighbors didn’t think it was safe,” she said, pointing. “Why you stay?”

He shrugged. “Tourist town. People moved when the tourists stopped coming. I've lived by the lighthouse since I was young. Not planning on leaving.”

“What if they evacuate you?”

“No one bothers you now, Missie. In a way, I like it better. People have begun to respect the sea again.”

She knelt beside the carcass and took out her kit. 

They appeared a few years after the meteorite. Fishermen began to catch them near New Zealand. They called them mermaids.The beings had spread through the oceans. Slowly at first. They had tried to contain them. Then, to keep them from entering the important bays and ports. The Mediterranean had lasted longer. The UE had mined the entire Gibraltar stretch, but these things just dig below it. That was the sea floor like nowadays: a bunch of undersea tunnels. 

Now people only move by plane, or blimp. Vital Cargo is escorted in armored convoys, like in the Battle of the Atlantic. Sometimes the sea would boil: oxygen and hydrogen breaking out of the water, igniting anything that passed close. The fires were bright enough to be seen from space. 

The camera’s memory card was almost full when the sailor spoke again:

“Dark soon,” the man said. 

The sea had always drawn her. Its violence, its endless shifting. As a child she had stood in tidepools with her toes wrinkled and numb, imagining whole kingdoms under the surface. Now, as the last streaks of orange flattened into slate, it felt less like a child’s dream, and more like a nightmare. 

“There’s no need to worry,” he said as she picked her things. 

“They don’t come on low tide. I’ve seen them, though. Black shades moving quiet across the beach. Their footprints reach the edge of town now, a little farther each year.”

She brushed the sand from her palms in silence. 

“I got coffee for the road. Come on, Lighthouse isn’t far.”

She followed him up the narrow path. The lighthouse loomed ahead. Its windows had been plated, and barbed wire shone dull in the evening light.

She hesitated on the threshold: “What do they want?”

“Sometimes they take things. Sometimes they leave things.” 

He shuffled into a back room and returned with a bundle. It looked like sea-grass knotted together, nacreous shells sewn in a pattern with some kind of black cord, thin as hair but strong as wire.

“A token,” he said, handing it to her. “Take it. I have no use for such things.”

It was cool and heavy in her palm, faintly damp, like something still alive.

She drank his coffee, thanked him, and left before the tide turned. At the car she paused, looking once more at the horizon. The last of the sun sank beneath the water as if swallowed whole, leaving a bruised shimmer in its place.

She slid into the driver’s seat, the strange token on the dash beside her notes. Behind her the lighthouse light sparked to life, sweeping its beam across the abandoned town, across the sea, across whatever was waiting there.

The oceans were no longer ours. We live in a blue world, in a way, their world now. 

Then she turned the key, and drove into the dark.

\-----------------------

**PART II: THE RIG**

By day, the sea was quiet. The armored convoy cut through the waves in formation, steel-gray against steel-gray. Helen stayed close to the command deck. On a bronze plate shine the words darken by time “He who rules the sea, rules all”. 

Nothing moved out there but the water.

At night, the ship blacked out completely. No windows in these new models, only the cold hum of machines. From the main display, the sea appeared in ghostly green through night-vision feeds, distorted and grainy, as though the water itself was static on the screen.

Then the alarm cut through the calm. Sonar had caught something huge. 

Red lights strobed across the corridor as the captain ordained the dept changes to be armed. The air vents hissed shut and the smell of ozone filled the ship as filtration systems sealed. Some crew already wore masks; a soldier pressed one into Helen’s hands.

On the display the water began to glow, faint, like an aurora in the depths. Then darker: something vast slid beneath the convoy, blotting out the green. It moved fast. Too fast. For a moment she thought the whole sea tilted.

In another moment it was gone. The glow slowly faded and alarms silenced. Real calm took longer to return. 

Just another uneventful night on the water.

At dawn, they reached the rig. The oil platform loomed like a fortress. The lowest support pylons, armored and bristling with steel spikes. Beams, half-submerged, were encrusted with barnacles. Above them, automated turrets swept in slow arcs. 

Helen guessed the defenses Below, mines layered in rings, and nets strung like spiderwebs across the approaches. She boarded a Zodiac, weaving past the perimeter. The platform elevator took her up. 

The man who met her had his arm bandaged, skin raw where he hadn’t covered fast enough. He said nothing as he waved her deeper into the structure.

The infirmary stank of antiseptic and blood. She sealed herself in a hazmat suit before stepping inside. Two dozen beds lined the walls, each occupied by men in stained bandages, their skin red, blistered, and weeping.



“There was a malfunction on the main drill,” one of the supervisors explained. 

“Night shift was out fixing it when the fog came. Alarms didn’t trip in time. We found some of the detectors coated with… little things. Worm-sized. They’d crawled into the casings. We’re replacing all of them, soaking them in poison. You remember the Balkans? Same fog.”

Helen nodded grimly. She had seen the tapes. Yellow haze rolling across a ship’s deck, like mustard gas, men screaming as their flesh melted away.

A nurse leaned close. “It’s not just chemical burns. There’s something else in the fog this time. A neural agent, maybe. We haven't had time to analyze it properly. It does something to the brain.”

Helen followed the nurse to one of the survivors. He lay sedated, grafts of new skin patching his arms and chest. His eyes opened when they approached.

“Tell her what you saw.” asked the nurse in a gentle voice.

His voice was cracked, but insistent. “The fog. It took them. Took them away. I took me too”

“Away?”

“Normandy.” the wounded man replied. “One moment we were here, the next, we were coming out of the Higgins into the beach, under heavy fire”. 

Helen watched at the nurse, she just glared back at the man so she would hear the rest of the story. 

“People were falling like flies, machine guns tearing them apart. The beach was red. A thick smoke began to rise, and I could barely see. But I saw them, coming out of the smoke. Dark and tall, shapeless. They took Brandon and Higgs, dragged them back into the sea.” 

The man's voice grew quieter. “I know. Can see it in your face. But it was all real. I was there,on the D day. I know it because I was shoot.” He lifted his arm, no fingers left on his hand, and pointed to his shoulder. “Right here. Ain't that true Doc?” asked to the nurse. 

“Why don't you rest, son.” she replied politely. 

The doctor showed her later in the briefing room. 

“We found it after triage, when we ran x-rays.” he offered. “It was logged into the shoulder plate”. 

“Have you found the bodies of the other two men?” she asked. 

“As of yet, no”. The doctor replied sharply. 

She weighed the relic in her gloved hand, just as she weighed the words in her mind. A warped, ancient thing. The metal was pitted and corroded. Unmistakably old.

A bullet fired eighty years ago. 



\-----------------------

**PART III: THE DEEP**

The descent took hours. The submersible creaked as it slid into the black water, a slow fall into silence. Helen sat with her notes clutched to her chest, watching the pressure gauges climb. Out the viewport: nothing. Only the dull glow of instruments against the thick glass.

Dr Brand began the small talk. 

“So, how long you been with the institute”

“About ten years now.” She replied. “Joined right after college, had no place to get back to.” 

“I understand, I used to live in Wellington.”

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s ok, my parents had left for Europe before it happened. I was in Sumatra with my fiancé, she wanted to see the orangutans.” Then added “I was back two years ago, there’s nothing left, bombs took much of the landscape. Every now and then the army drops in heavy ordinance, when the nests grow big again. They just borrow deeper each year.”

After a moment of silence: “We’re here”

The caves appeared as a pale geometry on sonar first, then slowly resolved in the floodlights: a vast hollow sunk into the ocean floor, branching like veins. The walls shimmered, alive with mats of microbial growth.

They steered the sub into one of the larger tunnels. Finally the light fell onto the brain, but that wasn’t what caught Helen’s gaze. 

“It’s dead.” Venture Brand, then added:

“Well, not “dead” dead. There’s always residual activity but is all dissociated now, no trace of intelligence. Judging by the size, it’s been like this for a while.”

It clung to the seafloor like a coral head, the size of a small car. Its surface writhed with colors, microscopic organisms twitching in coordinated patterns. Each cell was a tiny organism, completely self sufficient, yet connected to their neighbors. Together, the layer formed awareness. 

When they observed this species for the first time, 20 years ago, it was believed to be coral. It all could’ve been stopped then, if they'd known better. It took them 5 years to finally run a DNA test. And even then they believed it to be a mistake. Another 9 months until it was finally peer reviewed and agreed it was not of this world. Soon later someone finally connected the dots with Auckland's meteorite. But by then it was too late. 

As they grow, they become more intelligent. The brain lived only on the outer surface of the shell, like actual corals.  As it aged, parts of canvas died, isolating nodules from one another. By that time nests would grow erratic, mad. Sometimes the drones and hunters would be reclaimed by another nest and migrate, or simply wither away.

Around the brain floated sacs of translucent jelly, tethered like lanterns. Inside, marine and terrestrial bodies. Dogs, seals, and other shapes she couldn’t name. Some were humans…  barely. 

Their flesh had become glassy, their veins glowing faintly, while small tick-like organisms flickered inside them. Luminous beneath the skin.

Brand guessed what she was thinking and whispered, “Some are still alive.”

Helen’s stomach turned. “Alive?”

“In a way. Preserved, dismantled slowly. We think it’s part of their strategy. They study us so they can learn our weaknesses, and to see if there’s something useful.”

“The small ones are not conscious,” the biologist continued pointing at the dead brain. “Briefly mobile in their youth, before they fix to the sea floor. But they understand things fast. They’re not like us, never needed any machines.”

The hunters, the chimeras, the squid sharks, and dire eels, all are engineered in nests like this. Grown from genetic samples, some from planet earth, some from… god knows where. Busy little creatures, every year they come up with something new.  

“They wanna come to land.” Helen finally said. “I’ve been collecting hunter samples from bodies that have run ashore”. Each time there's a bit more of human DNA in the samples. I was on an oil rig near Mexico last month. They took a couple workers, probably they’re now in a cocoon like these poor bastards.”

She took the old bullet in her pocket and handed it to Brand. “There’s something else.”

“Oh, yeah.” he replied. “I’ve heard about it too.”

“How is that possible?” 

“If you have mastered genetic engineering, it is only a matter of time before you start using it to improve yourself too. We drilled cores from new nests, the ones on Wellington. Its structure is changing.”

“Changing how?”

“To be honest we’re not sure. Usually there’s only dead calcified tissue beneath the brain's outer skin. The samples we took had a different structure, more complex and deliberate. We ran all the tests you can think of, the one that scared us the most was the simplest.”

“Tell me.” 

“A clock. Atomic precision clock, by chance one the guys from the physics department left one of the samples near it. Next morning when he grabbed it, he noticed the clock was off for half a second.”

“I’m a marine biologist, what does that mean?” She asked.

“Well, me too. He said a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. The part I got was about the time dilation, a relativistic effect. The result of distortions on space-time. But, let’s not jump into conclusions please. That’s just bad science. They are analyzing it now, people way smarter than me.” He finished nervously. 

“But what do YOU think”

He sighed. “That we haven't seen the end of it yet.”

It was around noon when I began to see signs of a town. An old, weathered windmill creaked and groaned in the calm gusts of wind. Along the sides of the road were old fences and even older barns. Everything looked like it was falling apart. Their roofs were gone and the walls looked like they would fall over at any moment. 

Just off the road was a dilapidated sign that said, ‘*Welcome to Judgment, Home of The Watchtower*’. 

A chill ran down my spine at the sight of the sign. The words ‘*The Watchtower*’ stood out to me in a way that I couldn’t quite explain. I couldn’t help but find myself staring idly at the massive stone column that rose above the town like an altar to an ancient deity.

“That thing must be The Watchtower,” I said.

“I suppose it is.” 

His tone was absent of emotion and I wondered what he was thinking. Was he worried for his sister?

“Hopefully we can find Lu right away, I…don’t want to stay here longer than I have to.”

“I agree. It’s…creepy out here,” Varo said. 

As we drove into Judgment, it became increasingly clear that there was not much to the town. There was a mainstreet that had a dozen or so buildings lining it. There looked to be a general store, a bar, a cafe, and a rather decrepit building that said ‘tourist info’ across the top of it.

Everything in the town was constructed from sun-bleached wood and didn’t appear to have been updated anytime recently. The town was dusty, sand had blown across much of the road, making it look more ghostly than necessary. 

I would have considered it to be abandoned if I hadn’t seen a handful of people walking around. They all had big smiles on their faces. One man even waved at us as we drove through. I glanced at Varo. If he was uncomfortable, he didn’t show it.

“How do they live like this?” I said. I might’ve spent the better part of my life moving around the country, often living in less-than-ideal situations. But this felt…barren. 

“I don’t know,” Varo said. “Look there,” he pointed to a building at the end of town, a large garage, constructed of rusted metal siding. 

The garage door looked like it hadn’t been open in ages. Beside it was a much smaller people-door. Letters across the top of it read, ‘*Judgment Auto and Towing*’.

“We should start there,” I said. “We need to find out if someone picked up Lu.”

Varo nodded and parked my car beside the entrance to the garage. I opened my door and stepped out into the gusty desert town. I looked around, wondering why the hell anyone would live out here. It looked more like the set to a Clint Eastwood movie than a real town.

Above me, The Watchtower loomed like an old god. Its white, dusty surface looked pale compared to its surroundings. Simply looking at it, sent a strange feeling into my core. 

Varo seemed disinterested in the strange town and even The Watchtower. In fact, he seemed to be purposefully avoiding looking at it. Instead, his attention was on the auto shop.

As I followed Varo into the shop, I found myself in a small office, separated from the rest of the garage. A middle-aged man sat at the desk, glancing between us with unabashed curiosity. His graying hair was mostly covered by a wide-brimmed hat. His eyes were a pale shade of gray. For a moment, he said nothing.

“Welcome,” he said as he cleared his throat. “How can I help y’all out today?”

“We’re looking for a woman named Lu,” I said. “According to my information, she called this company right before her phone died. I suspect she might have had car troubles.”

“A girl named Lu, huh?”

“Luciana,” Varo clarified.

The man stood and began to rummage through a collection of papers on his desk. I noticed that the nametag on his dirty, blue coveralls simply said ‘Coyote’. 

“Yeah,” he said as he held a piece of paper in front of his face. “Luciana Delgado.”

“That’s her,” I said. “Do you know if she’s still here?”

Coyote chuckled. “Well, I don’t see where else she’d be. Her car isn't fixed yet and it takes several days of walkin’ to reach the next town.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I don’t suppose you have any idea where she is?”

Coyote pointed a weathered finger at the door, in the direction of the mainstreet. “Probably down at the Cozy Snake. Don’t know where else she’d find a room.”

I let out a breath of relief and glanced at Varo. I was surprised to find that there were no obvious signs of relief across his face. Instead, he looked more tense than ever. 

“Thanks,” I said to Coyote.

I walked outside with Varo, surprised by his lack of enthusiasm. We had done it. His sister was safe in a motel only a few blocks from us. Why did he look so tense?

“Well,” I said with a grin. “We did it. Lu is alright.”

Varo forced a smile. “Thank you, Harper,” he said. “I’ll…be sure to buy your room and dinner tonight.”

I smiled as I walked down the street towards the motel, feeling accomplished. 

The Cozy Snake, a small, run-down motel. It had only a dozen rooms, one of which was being rented by Lu. After a brief talk with the woman at the front desk, Varo made his way to room number seven. He knocked on the door until it was answered by a petite, dark-haired woman with an assortment of piercings on her ears and nose.

Lu’s features softened the moment she saw Varo. The young woman threw her arms around him and let out a loud sob. 

“Varo,” she said quietly between sobs. “I didn’t think…I’m so sorry…I didn’t meant-”

“It’s alright,” he said gently.

The emotional scene made me suddenly aware of my lack-of-purpose at that moment. I waited uncomfortably as Varo attempted to console his sister.

“How the hell did you find me?” Lu finally asked as she pulled away from him.

“This is Harper,” he said with a gesture to me. “She’s a private investigator. I…I thought it was weird when I didn’t hear back from you after that fight with mom.”

Lu hesitated slightly as she flicked a piece of her shoulder-length hair out of her face. Her dark eyes found mine and she quickly looked away. 

“Thanks for coming to get me,” she said quietly. 

Her disposition had changed so suddenly, I felt like I had missed an important piece of the conversation.

“Always,” Varo said. 

There was an odd pause of silence that I felt needed to be interrupted. So, I said, “it sounds like your car is still getting worked on. I’ll book myself a room here for the night but since…we found you, I suppose I’ll be leaving in the morning.”

Varo glanced at me and back towards his sister. He pulled out a well-worn leather wallet and handed it to me. 

“It’s on me. I promised I’d pay, remember?”

“Right,” I grabbed the wallet. “Thanks.”

I left the two Delgado siblings alone in front of door number seven and walked to the front desk. I got the feeling that the two of them had personal matters to discuss. Since I had successfully fulfilled my end of the bargain and I had no problem letting Varo pay for my room.

The front desk was run by a mousy woman named Alma. She was likely about ten years my senior with ash-blonde hair and eyes that never quite met mine. 

“Hey,” I said as friendly as I could. “I’m back. I was hoping to get a room for the night.”

“Just one night?” Alma seemed mystified by this.

I nodded. “Yup, I’ve got a long way to go tomorrow, so just tonight.”

Alma nodded and wrote something down in a notebook. It seemed the motel was void of all technology. There wasn’t even a card-reader in sight. I opened Varo’s wallet hoping he had cash on him.

“That’ll be seventy dollars,” she said.

To my luck and mild shock, there was nothing in Varo’s wallet but three hundred dollar bills. I handed one of the bills to Alma, still gazing at the wallet in amusement. There were no credit cards, gift cards, or even a driver's license. I found it curious, but nothing more.

Alma handed me back the change as well as an old key. I thanked her and walked outside towards my car to gather my things. I grabbed the overnight bag I had backed and gazed out at the town around me.

A handful of people loitered in front of the bar. A man with a cigarette spoke loudly about having to work on a Saturday. The men around validated his frustration with a groan. Beside the man with a cigarette was Coyote, the mechanic. He wasn’t engaging in the conversation, however. Instead, he was staring at me.

I was about to walk to my room at the motel when I noticed Coyote shift and begin to walk across the street towards me. I let out a long sigh. *He better not be a creep*, was all I could think.

“Y’know I never caught your name, miss,” he said in a slow, casual manner.

“I’m Harper,” I said, extending my hand.

Coyote shook it. “They call me Coyote.” He pointed to his nametag.

“That’s quite the name.”

He laughed and said, “Yeah and I almost deserve it.”

“How is Lu’s car coming along?”

“Waitin’ on the parts.” He paused. “Say, you don’t have a moment to speak in private, do you?”

A wave of uncertainty passed over me. “I…I just got a room, but I’m sorry it’s been a long day. I need a moment to relax and-”

“If you were any kind of smart, you’d get in that car and leave this gods-forsaken town.” There was ice in his words. 

“I’m sorry, what?” I was too baffled by his sudden change in tone to fully comprehend what he was saying to me.

“Get in that car and go,” his voice was low but sharp.

“I just got a room. Besides, I plan to leave tomorrow.”

“It’ll be too late by then.”

“I-” 

“Leave the young lady alone,” a man joked as he slung an arm around Coyote’s shoulders. 

Coyote looked irritated but made no attempt to get away from the other man.

“Ophelia, I was beginning to think you actually did it,” the stranger addressed me. 

He was an odd-looking man with sunken-in eyes and pale hair. It was almost impossible to tell his age but from the way he carried himself, he appeared to be in charge–or at least thought he was.

“What?” I asked, confused by the strange remark. 

“This is Harper, Leon,” Coyote said with a groan. “She’s not from around here.”

“Oh,” a strange look crossed his face as if he was realizing something for the first time. “I see. It’s nice to meet you Harper. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.”

“Thanks,” I said, taking a step away.

“Just consider what I said,” Coyote said quietly before following Leon back to the bar. 

He gave me one last glance before he walked up the steps towards the bar. The man who waited for him clapped him on the back and said something I couldn’t hear. For a brief moment, Coyote’s friend glanced at me with deep-set dark eyes. 

He was an odd-looking man with sallow features and white hair. There was something about him that made my skin turn clammy. I tried to ignore the feeling as I turned around.

*What the hell did Coyote mean? Why did he tell me to leave?*

I walked to my room, number six, and opened the door. I dropped my things on the ground and collapsed onto the bed. It was a shitty little motel, with a musty smell and stains on the carpet.

There were rose patterned curtains, bedsheets, and upholstery that rivaled a grandmother’s bedroom. Even the walls were what used to be a shade of baby pink. With time (and possibly some cigarette smoke) the walls were a sad shade of brown.

Despite the general filth of the room, laying down on a bed felt incredible. Before I had time to consider what Coyote had said to me, a knock came to my door. I stood up and opened it. Varo stood outside, watching me with a steady look.

“What did that old man say to you?”

I shrugged. “He told me I should leave…I don’t know, he was just drunk, maybe he’s not in the mood for tourists.”

“Maybe,” Varo hesitated for a moment. “Do you have my wallet?”

“Oh!” I had nearly forgotten about that. I handed him the wallet back. He was about to leave when I asked, “isn’t it a little odd to only be carrying cash around with you?”

He shrugged. “I don’t need anything else.”

“A driver’s license would come in handy,” I joked.

“Don’t have one.”

Before I could say anything, he walked away and disappeared into Lu’s room. *I let him drive my car and that bastard doesn’t even have a license*, was all I could think.

I fell asleep early that night but it was a restless sleep. My dreams consisted of pale figures, bloody floors, and pain. When I woke up my lower abdomen felt like it had been stabbed. I rolled around, wondering why the hell I was getting period cramps now of all times. It was early–too early–in the month for that.

With a groan, I got up and grabbed the Advil I had packed. I walked to the bathroom and put the pills in my mouth. When I went to fill up a cup with water, no water came from the faucet. Frustrated, I walked back into the room and found a half-finished soda I had brought up with me. I downed the pills with a bit of stale soda and laid back on the dusty bed.

As I laid there, waiting for the pain to subside, I decided that Judgment was an awful town. It was dirty and run-down. There was no water in the sink and Coyote had thoroughly scared the shit out of me. 

And then there was The Watchtower.

From my spot on the bed, I gazed towards the tiny window. The curtains were closed as much as I could close them. However, a little gap remained. In that gap, The Watchtower stood. In the darkness of the room, I gazed outside, staring at the strange structure. 

My stomach churned, just like it had when I had been forced to pull over. Only this time, I didn’t vomit, I just stared out at The Watchtower in silence. I wanted more than ever to go home.

“I only have to wait for the morning,” I said to myself. “Then I’ll be out of this backwards town.”

Eventually, I fell back asleep. 

When I woke up the next time, morning light poured in through the little window on my door. I woke slowly, thankful that the pain I had felt the night before was gone. I got dressed and attempted to brush my teeth, only to realize there was still no water.

I let out a sigh, grabbed my key, and left the room. I found Alma sitting behind the front desk, reading what looked to be a particularly steamy romance book. When she failed to notice me, I cleared my throat.

“Oh! Sorry, hun,” she said, putting the book cover down on the desk. “I didn’t see ya.”

“There’s no water in my room,” I said. I knew I was being rude but I was tired after such a weird night of sleep.

“Right,” she adjusted her glasses, still avoiding my eyes. “Well, that’s because the water truck hasn’t arrived yet. But don’t worry, it’ll be here by tonight.”

I blinked. “Water truck?”

“Judgment has no water. We’ve never had water. We have it shipped in like food or fuel.”

I had never heard of such a thing. I almost didn’t believe her. 

“We’ve got a big old tank on top of the motel,” Alma said cheerily. “Giant thing. Weighs a ton when it’s full. The truck will fill it up along with the rest of the shops’ tanks.”

“So, there’s no water in town right now?”

“Nope, but like I said, he’ll show up tonight. But if you’re feeling peckish, the general store will be open in a few minutes.”

“Alright,” I said with a sigh. “Thanks.”

As Alma suggested, the general store opened shortly after I arrived. It was small, hardly larger than most convenience stores. It had a wall of frozen food, a wall of refrigerated food, and several aisles of non perishables, toiletries, and medicine. 

The entire shop felt like it had been suspended in time. Nothing had been updated since the 1970s. All the refrigerators were old and well-worn. An old box TV sat behind the counter, playing what looked to be soap opera.

The store was small, but I was still surprised by their lack of supplies. There were no fresh veggies, no dairy, no dry goods for baking. All that appeared to be in stock was their meat selection. 

To give them credit, the meat looked phenomenal. It was fresh and came in a variety of cuts. Hell, most of it looked like far better quality than anything I got back at the deli in Phoenix. I couldn’t help but linger in the meat aisle, wondering why meat–out of everything–was so well-stocked.

Despite their incredible meat selection, there was no water. Not gallon jugs or cases of bottled water. There was nothing. I turned and walked to the front. A young boy stood behind the counter looking helplessly bored as the TV drama played on beside him. 

“Can I help you?” he asked in a monotone voice.

“Do you have any water?”

He looked genuinely surprised by the question. “Water?”

“Yes, like a gallon jug or something. It doesn’t have to be the nice stuff, I just need something.” I explained.

“Sorry,” he said. “Don’t have any of that.”

“Really?” I was surprised. 

“No, ma’am,” he said.

I nodded and left the shop, feeling angrier than I should have. No water in the motel, no water at the store. Coyote was right to tell me the town was *god-forsaken*. I was beginning to understand.

When I made it back to The Cozy Snake, I found Varo lingering outside on the front steps, smoking a cigarette. He gave me a slight nod as I approached and handed me a styrofoam cup.

“Figured you might want some coffee.”

I clutched the warm cup, suddenly grateful. “Thanks.” I took a sip and instantly half of the irritation I felt lifted away from me. “This is a weird town,” I said after a moment.

Varo blew out a cloud of smoke and shrugged.

“There’s no water here. They bring it in on trucks, I guess. Isn’t that strange?”

“It’s unusual, but I’m sure the water is on its way. No one can live without water.”

I realized then that I was overreacting. I took another sip of the coffee and attempted to calm my nerves. 

“So,” I said after a moment. “I’m gonna try and pack up and head out within the next hour. I kinda figured you’d wait with Lu but-”

“You might want to hold off on leaving,” Varo said. 

His dark eyes drifted past me and focused in on the distant horizon.

I turned around to see what he was looking at. The skies were a hazy shade of tan and brown. 

“Fuck,” was all I could say.

Varo smirked as he took another drag of the cigarette. “It’s best to wait out dust storms. It’s hard to tell how bad it’ll be. There’s no cell service out here if you were to run into a problem.”	I stared at the approaching storm in disbelief. No water, no cell phone service, and an approaching storm–I didn’t know if I could hate a place any more than I hated Judgment.

Unbeknownst to me, dust storms were cause for celebration in the town of Judgment. And by ‘celebration’, I mean excessive drinking. From what I gathered most of the town had decided to hunker down in the bar while the storm passed. According to a handful of folks, it was something of a tradition.

Whisker’s Whiskey was the only bar as well as the only restaurant in all of Judgment. With the storm approaching quickly, we all found ourselves sitting together in the restaurant. It wasn’t my idea to join the crowd, but according to Alma, the motel would be ‘uncomfortable’ during a dust storm. 

I wasn’t willing to wait around and figure out what she meant by that.

A group of kids played a board game on the floor while adults stood or sat in groups talking. A line of old men sat at the bar, drinking to their heart's content. Coyote and his white-haired friend were among them. I sat with Varo and Lu at a small table that was intended for only two. My knees kept bumping into theirs.

“Thank you, Harper,” Lu said as she sipped on her cup of soda. “Sorry you’re trapped here, now.”

“It’s alright,” I said as I sipped my rather strong gin and tonic. “It’s part of my job,” I shrugged.

“So, you’re a *real* private investigator? That must be so fascinating,” Lu pressed on.

I laughed. “Not as much as you’d assume. I mean, it has its moments but most of the time, things are pretty straight forward. People are…predictable.”

“You’re like a real Sherlock Holmes,” Lu said more to herself than to me.

I said nothing. I hated that comparison, but I was never really sure why.

“Was I hard to find?”

“Not particularly,” I said. “The only strange part has been this town…and your motivations for going someplace so far from home.”

Lu shot a glance at Varo and then back at me. “Well, I was born here,” she said matter-of-factly. “So, I don’t think it’s that far of a stretch to assume-”

“I’m sorry, what?” I was now focused more on Varo than I was on Lu. “She was *born* here?”

“I…I may have failed to mention that detail,” was all Varo said in his defense.

“I usually call that *withholding information*.”

“You’re not a cop,” he raised an eyebrow and finished off the double-shot of whiskey he had been nursing for over an hour.

“No,” I said. “But why wouldn’t you tell me about this town? You acted like you had never heard of Judgment. You didn’t need me, you could have found Lu on your own. Why the *hell* did you bring me here?” 

At some point while I yelled at Varo, I stood up. The bar had quieted significantly by the time I finished what I had to say. Varo watched me silently. He seemed unable to come up with a suitable answer.

“Listen, Harper, I-”

“Fuck this,” I said as I walked across the now-quiet bar. 

I opened the door and rushed outside into the bitter, desert storm. Sand stung my skin but I forced myself to run towards where I had parked my car.

I found the old sedan and jumped in, starting it up quickly. It started and the air vents kicked dust and sand into the cab. I coughed and turned off the vents. I gazed out the window, realizing the visibility was just as terrible as I imagined it. 

However, I could still see the road. So, I gripped the wheel hard and pulled out onto the street.

The wind whipped around me like a monster wanting to get into my car. It howled and shook the old vehicle. The wheel tugged in my hands, the car felt like it was magnetically drawn towards the ditch. However, I refused to give into fear. I needed to get out of this wretched place.

I could only make out just enough of the road to see about twenty feet ahead of me. I stared at the wall of golden dust and hoped that it was near its end. 

I don’t know how long I drove for. Every muscle was tense as I drove through that storm, my eyes strained to see through the dusty skies. I think if I would have waited just a little longer in Judgment, I would have had a better chance. But like so many things, the odds were stacked against me. 

Judgment did not want me to leave.

Just as I was beginning to feel more comfortable with the road conditions, a giant object emerged from the dust. It was an elk. I swerved slightly to avoid hitting the animal. My right tire was suddenly caught by something on the side of the road and I lost control of the car.

My world went black.

*The entire town was there, standing under the shadow of The Watchtower. They were dressed in loose sand-colored cloaks. Their hoods were pulled up so far over their heads, I could hardly see their eyes. While their robes matched the landscape, my dress matched the giant stone behind me.*

*I stood in front of the crowd, the great white monolith behind me. I was terrified. My heart beat so fast I thought I was going to be sick or pass out. Beside me was one of the cloaked figures. He held my arm so hard, I was certain it would bruise.*

*I wasn’t listening to the words he was speaking, but the crowd seemed enraptured by whatever he was saying. I was trying desperately to see anyone I knew.* 

*Were my parents there?* 

*My friends?* 

*Would they help me?* 

*Would they stop this?*

*I got no answers to my questions.*

*“Today, our young Ophelia will walk into The Watchtower a girl and return a woman,” the man beside me said as he raised his hand upwards.*

*The crowd bowed to one knee in unison. I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I continued to search the crowd for someone, anyone to help me. At the outskirts of the group, someone was looking up under their hood. Her eyes found mine.*

*Carmen.* 

*She stared at me with the fear of a mother. But there was more than just fear in her eyes–there was anger. She clutched her young son tight against her chest. He was watching me too, confused as to what was happening.* 

*As I stared into Carmen’s eyes, I saw a tear slip down her cheek. I didn’t want her to cry. I liked Carmen. She was friends with my parents and she always invited me over to watch old movies with her son. I couldn’t understand why she was crying.*

*Beside me, the man who held my hand said, “Ophelia, do you accept the gift you have been given?”*

*“I do,” I had practiced this part a hundred times.*

*“And how will you accept it?”*

*“Under the watch of our ancestors,” I recited.*

*“From birth comes life.”*

*“And from life comes death,” I replied.*

*I had to tear my eyes away from Carmen’s. She was making me feel worse. It was an honor to be chosen.*  

*“Turn,” the man said quietly.*

*I turned to face The Watchtower. Behind me the crowd was silent.*

*“Go forth to serve the ones who give us life.”*

*I stepped closer to the towering structure. At its base was a narrow crack in the stone. I knew I was meant to enter, but now fear was catching up to me. However, if I faltered, there would be punishments. I knew that well-enough to force myself to keep walking.*

*As I approached the great stone, tears were flowing freely down my face. I wanted my parents. I wanted to go home. I didn’t want this.*",1,1758458865.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

It was around noon when I began to see signs of a town. An old, weathered windmill creaked and groaned in the calm gusts of wind. Along the sides of the road were old fences and even older barns. Everything looked like it was falling apart. Their roofs were gone and the walls looked like they would fall over at any moment. 

Just off the road was a dilapidated sign that said, ‘*Welcome to Judgment, Home of The Watchtower*’. 

A chill ran down my spine at the sight of the sign. The words ‘*The Watchtower*’ stood out to me in a way that I couldn’t quite explain. I couldn’t help but find myself staring idly at the massive stone column that rose above the town like an altar to an ancient deity.

“That thing must be The Watchtower,” I said.

“I suppose it is.” 

His tone was absent of emotion and I wondered what he was thinking. Was he worried for his sister?

“Hopefully we can find Lu right away, I…don’t want to stay here longer than I have to.”

“I agree. It’s…creepy out here,” Varo said. 

As we drove into Judgment, it became increasingly clear that there was not much to the town. There was a mainstreet that had a dozen or so buildings lining it. There looked to be a general store, a bar, a cafe, and a rather decrepit building that said ‘tourist info’ across the top of it.

Everything in the town was constructed from sun-bleached wood and didn’t appear to have been updated anytime recently. The town was dusty, sand had blown across much of the road, making it look more ghostly than necessary. 

I would have considered it to be abandoned if I hadn’t seen a handful of people walking around. They all had big smiles on their faces. One man even waved at us as we drove through. I glanced at Varo. If he was uncomfortable, he didn’t show it.

“How do they live like this?” I said. I might’ve spent the better part of my life moving around the country, often living in less-than-ideal situations. But this felt…barren. 

“I don’t know,” Varo said. “Look there,” he pointed to a building at the end of town, a large garage, constructed of rusted metal siding. 

The garage door looked like it hadn’t been open in ages. Beside it was a much smaller people-door. Letters across the top of it read, ‘*Judgment Auto and Towing*’.

“We should start there,” I said. “We need to find out if someone picked up Lu.”

Varo nodded and parked my car beside the entrance to the garage. I opened my door and stepped out into the gusty desert town. I looked around, wondering why the hell anyone would live out here. It looked more like the set to a Clint Eastwood movie than a real town.

Above me, The Watchtower loomed like an old god. Its white, dusty surface looked pale compared to its surroundings. Simply looking at it, sent a strange feeling into my core. 

Varo seemed disinterested in the strange town and even The Watchtower. In fact, he seemed to be purposefully avoiding looking at it. Instead, his attention was on the auto shop.

As I followed Varo into the shop, I found myself in a small office, separated from the rest of the garage. A middle-aged man sat at the desk, glancing between us with unabashed curiosity. His graying hair was mostly covered by a wide-brimmed hat. His eyes were a pale shade of gray. For a moment, he said nothing.

“Welcome,” he said as he cleared his throat. “How can I help y’all out today?”

“We’re looking for a woman named Lu,” I said. “According to my information, she called this company right before her phone died. I suspect she might have had car troubles.”

“A girl named Lu, huh?”

“Luciana,” Varo clarified.

The man stood and began to rummage through a collection of papers on his desk. I noticed that the nametag on his dirty, blue coveralls simply said ‘Coyote’. 

“Yeah,” he said as he held a piece of paper in front of his face. “Luciana Delgado.”

“That’s her,” I said. “Do you know if she’s still here?”

Coyote chuckled. “Well, I don’t see where else she’d be. Her car isn't fixed yet and it takes several days of walkin’ to reach the next town.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I don’t suppose you have any idea where she is?”

Coyote pointed a weathered finger at the door, in the direction of the mainstreet. “Probably down at the Cozy Snake. Don’t know where else she’d find a room.”

I let out a breath of relief and glanced at Varo. I was surprised to find that there were no obvious signs of relief across his face. Instead, he looked more tense than ever. 

“Thanks,” I said to Coyote.

I walked outside with Varo, surprised by his lack of enthusiasm. We had done it. His sister was safe in a motel only a few blocks from us. Why did he look so tense?

“Well,” I said with a grin. “We did it. Lu is alright.”

Varo forced a smile. “Thank you, Harper,” he said. “I’ll…be sure to buy your room and dinner tonight.”

I smiled as I walked down the street towards the motel, feeling accomplished. 

The Cozy Snake, a small, run-down motel. It had only a dozen rooms, one of which was being rented by Lu. After a brief talk with the woman at the front desk, Varo made his way to room number seven. He knocked on the door until it was answered by a petite, dark-haired woman with an assortment of piercings on her ears and nose.

Lu’s features softened the moment she saw Varo. The young woman threw her arms around him and let out a loud sob. 

“Varo,” she said quietly between sobs. “I didn’t think…I’m so sorry…I didn’t meant-”

“It’s alright,” he said gently.

The emotional scene made me suddenly aware of my lack-of-purpose at that moment. I waited uncomfortably as Varo attempted to console his sister.

“How the hell did you find me?” Lu finally asked as she pulled away from him.

“This is Harper,” he said with a gesture to me. “She’s a private investigator. I…I thought it was weird when I didn’t hear back from you after that fight with mom.”

Lu hesitated slightly as she flicked a piece of her shoulder-length hair out of her face. Her dark eyes found mine and she quickly looked away. 

“Thanks for coming to get me,” she said quietly. 

Her disposition had changed so suddenly, I felt like I had missed an important piece of the conversation.

“Always,” Varo said. 

There was an odd pause of silence that I felt needed to be interrupted. So, I said, “it sounds like your car is still getting worked on. I’ll book myself a room here for the night but since…we found you, I suppose I’ll be leaving in the morning.”

Varo glanced at me and back towards his sister. He pulled out a well-worn leather wallet and handed it to me. 

“It’s on me. I promised I’d pay, remember?”

“Right,” I grabbed the wallet. “Thanks.”

I left the two Delgado siblings alone in front of door number seven and walked to the front desk. I got the feeling that the two of them had personal matters to discuss. Since I had successfully fulfilled my end of the bargain and I had no problem letting Varo pay for my room.

The front desk was run by a mousy woman named Alma. She was likely about ten years my senior with ash-blonde hair and eyes that never quite met mine. 

“Hey,” I said as friendly as I could. “I’m back. I was hoping to get a room for the night.”

“Just one night?” Alma seemed mystified by this.

I nodded. “Yup, I’ve got a long way to go tomorrow, so just tonight.”

Alma nodded and wrote something down in a notebook. It seemed the motel was void of all technology. There wasn’t even a card-reader in sight. I opened Varo’s wallet hoping he had cash on him.

“That’ll be seventy dollars,” she said.

To my luck and mild shock, there was nothing in Varo’s wallet but three hundred dollar bills. I handed one of the bills to Alma, still gazing at the wallet in amusement. There were no credit cards, gift cards, or even a driver's license. I found it curious, but nothing more.

Alma handed me back the change as well as an old key. I thanked her and walked outside towards my car to gather my things. I grabbed the overnight bag I had backed and gazed out at the town around me.

A handful of people loitered in front of the bar. A man with a cigarette spoke loudly about having to work on a Saturday. The men around validated his frustration with a groan. Beside the man with a cigarette was Coyote, the mechanic. He wasn’t engaging in the conversation, however. Instead, he was staring at me.

I was about to walk to my room at the motel when I noticed Coyote shift and begin to walk across the street towards me. I let out a long sigh. *He better not be a creep*, was all I could think.

“Y’know I never caught your name, miss,” he said in a slow, casual manner.

“I’m Harper,” I said, extending my hand.

Coyote shook it. “They call me Coyote.” He pointed to his nametag.

“That’s quite the name.”

He laughed and said, “Yeah and I almost deserve it.”

“How is Lu’s car coming along?”

“Waitin’ on the parts.” He paused. “Say, you don’t have a moment to speak in private, do you?”

A wave of uncertainty passed over me. “I…I just got a room, but I’m sorry it’s been a long day. I need a moment to relax and-”

“If you were any kind of smart, you’d get in that car and leave this gods-forsaken town.” There was ice in his words. 

“I’m sorry, what?” I was too baffled by his sudden change in tone to fully comprehend what he was saying to me.

“Get in that car and go,” his voice was low but sharp.

“I just got a room. Besides, I plan to leave tomorrow.”

“It’ll be too late by then.”

“I-” 

“Leave the young lady alone,” a man joked as he slung an arm around Coyote’s shoulders. 

Coyote looked irritated but made no attempt to get away from the other man.

“Ophelia, I was beginning to think you actually did it,” the stranger addressed me. 

He was an odd-looking man with sunken-in eyes and pale hair. It was almost impossible to tell his age but from the way he carried himself, he appeared to be in charge–or at least thought he was.

“What?” I asked, confused by the strange remark. 

“This is Harper, Leon,” Coyote said with a groan. “She’s not from around here.”

“Oh,” a strange look crossed his face as if he was realizing something for the first time. “I see. It’s nice to meet you Harper. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.”

“Thanks,” I said, taking a step away.

“Just consider what I said,” Coyote said quietly before following Leon back to the bar. 

He gave me one last glance before he walked up the steps towards the bar. The man who waited for him clapped him on the back and said something I couldn’t hear. For a brief moment, Coyote’s friend glanced at me with deep-set dark eyes. 

He was an odd-looking man with sallow features and white hair. There was something about him that made my skin turn clammy. I tried to ignore the feeling as I turned around.

*What the hell did Coyote mean? Why did he tell me to leave?*

I walked to my room, number six, and opened the door. I dropped my things on the ground and collapsed onto the bed. It was a shitty little motel, with a musty smell and stains on the carpet.

There were rose patterned curtains, bedsheets, and upholstery that rivaled a grandmother’s bedroom. Even the walls were what used to be a shade of baby pink. With time (and possibly some cigarette smoke) the walls were a sad shade of brown.

Despite the general filth of the room, laying down on a bed felt incredible. Before I had time to consider what Coyote had said to me, a knock came to my door. I stood up and opened it. Varo stood outside, watching me with a steady look.

“What did that old man say to you?”

I shrugged. “He told me I should leave…I don’t know, he was just drunk, maybe he’s not in the mood for tourists.”

“Maybe,” Varo hesitated for a moment. “Do you have my wallet?”

“Oh!” I had nearly forgotten about that. I handed him the wallet back. He was about to leave when I asked, “isn’t it a little odd to only be carrying cash around with you?”

He shrugged. “I don’t need anything else.”

“A driver’s license would come in handy,” I joked.

“Don’t have one.”

Before I could say anything, he walked away and disappeared into Lu’s room. *I let him drive my car and that bastard doesn’t even have a license*, was all I could think.

I fell asleep early that night but it was a restless sleep. My dreams consisted of pale figures, bloody floors, and pain. When I woke up my lower abdomen felt like it had been stabbed. I rolled around, wondering why the hell I was getting period cramps now of all times. It was early–too early–in the month for that.

With a groan, I got up and grabbed the Advil I had packed. I walked to the bathroom and put the pills in my mouth. When I went to fill up a cup with water, no water came from the faucet. Frustrated, I walked back into the room and found a half-finished soda I had brought up with me. I downed the pills with a bit of stale soda and laid back on the dusty bed.

As I laid there, waiting for the pain to subside, I decided that Judgment was an awful town. It was dirty and run-down. There was no water in the sink and Coyote had thoroughly scared the shit out of me. 

And then there was The Watchtower.

From my spot on the bed, I gazed towards the tiny window. The curtains were closed as much as I could close them. However, a little gap remained. In that gap, The Watchtower stood. In the darkness of the room, I gazed outside, staring at the strange structure. 

My stomach churned, just like it had when I had been forced to pull over. Only this time, I didn’t vomit, I just stared out at The Watchtower in silence. I wanted more than ever to go home.

“I only have to wait for the morning,” I said to myself. “Then I’ll be out of this backwards town.”

Eventually, I fell back asleep. 

When I woke up the next time, morning light poured in through the little window on my door. I woke slowly, thankful that the pain I had felt the night before was gone. I got dressed and attempted to brush my teeth, only to realize there was still no water.

I let out a sigh, grabbed my key, and left the room. I found Alma sitting behind the front desk, reading what looked to be a particularly steamy romance book. When she failed to notice me, I cleared my throat.

“Oh! Sorry, hun,” she said, putting the book cover down on the desk. “I didn’t see ya.”

“There’s no water in my room,” I said. I knew I was being rude but I was tired after such a weird night of sleep.

“Right,” she adjusted her glasses, still avoiding my eyes. “Well, that’s because the water truck hasn’t arrived yet. But don’t worry, it’ll be here by tonight.”

I blinked. “Water truck?”

“Judgment has no water. We’ve never had water. We have it shipped in like food or fuel.”

I had never heard of such a thing. I almost didn’t believe her. 

“We’ve got a big old tank on top of the motel,” Alma said cheerily. “Giant thing. Weighs a ton when it’s full. The truck will fill it up along with the rest of the shops’ tanks.”

“So, there’s no water in town right now?”

“Nope, but like I said, he’ll show up tonight. But if you’re feeling peckish, the general store will be open in a few minutes.”

“Alright,” I said with a sigh. “Thanks.”

As Alma suggested, the general store opened shortly after I arrived. It was small, hardly larger than most convenience stores. It had a wall of frozen food, a wall of refrigerated food, and several aisles of non perishables, toiletries, and medicine. 

The entire shop felt like it had been suspended in time. Nothing had been updated since the 1970s. All the refrigerators were old and well-worn. An old box TV sat behind the counter, playing what looked to be soap opera.

The store was small, but I was still surprised by their lack of supplies. There were no fresh veggies, no dairy, no dry goods for baking. All that appeared to be in stock was their meat selection. 

To give them credit, the meat looked phenomenal. It was fresh and came in a variety of cuts. Hell, most of it looked like far better quality than anything I got back at the deli in Phoenix. I couldn’t help but linger in the meat aisle, wondering why meat–out of everything–was so well-stocked.

Despite their incredible meat selection, there was no water. Not gallon jugs or cases of bottled water. There was nothing. I turned and walked to the front. A young boy stood behind the counter looking helplessly bored as the TV drama played on beside him. 

“Can I help you?” he asked in a monotone voice.

“Do you have any water?”

He looked genuinely surprised by the question. “Water?”

“Yes, like a gallon jug or something. It doesn’t have to be the nice stuff, I just need something.” I explained.

“Sorry,” he said. “Don’t have any of that.”

“Really?” I was surprised. 

“No, ma’am,” he said.

I nodded and left the shop, feeling angrier than I should have. No water in the motel, no water at the store. Coyote was right to tell me the town was *god-forsaken*. I was beginning to understand.

When I made it back to The Cozy Snake, I found Varo lingering outside on the front steps, smoking a cigarette. He gave me a slight nod as I approached and handed me a styrofoam cup.

“Figured you might want some coffee.”

I clutched the warm cup, suddenly grateful. “Thanks.” I took a sip and instantly half of the irritation I felt lifted away from me. “This is a weird town,” I said after a moment.

Varo blew out a cloud of smoke and shrugged.

“There’s no water here. They bring it in on trucks, I guess. Isn’t that strange?”

“It’s unusual, but I’m sure the water is on its way. No one can live without water.”

I realized then that I was overreacting. I took another sip of the coffee and attempted to calm my nerves. 

“So,” I said after a moment. “I’m gonna try and pack up and head out within the next hour. I kinda figured you’d wait with Lu but-”

“You might want to hold off on leaving,” Varo said. 

His dark eyes drifted past me and focused in on the distant horizon.

I turned around to see what he was looking at. The skies were a hazy shade of tan and brown. 

“Fuck,” was all I could say.

Varo smirked as he took another drag of the cigarette. “It’s best to wait out dust storms. It’s hard to tell how bad it’ll be. There’s no cell service out here if you were to run into a problem.”	I stared at the approaching storm in disbelief. No water, no cell phone service, and an approaching storm–I didn’t know if I could hate a place any more than I hated Judgment.

Unbeknownst to me, dust storms were cause for celebration in the town of Judgment. And by ‘celebration’, I mean excessive drinking. From what I gathered most of the town had decided to hunker down in the bar while the storm passed. According to a handful of folks, it was something of a tradition.

Whisker’s Whiskey was the only bar as well as the only restaurant in all of Judgment. With the storm approaching quickly, we all found ourselves sitting together in the restaurant. It wasn’t my idea to join the crowd, but according to Alma, the motel would be ‘uncomfortable’ during a dust storm. 

I wasn’t willing to wait around and figure out what she meant by that.

A group of kids played a board game on the floor while adults stood or sat in groups talking. A line of old men sat at the bar, drinking to their heart's content. Coyote and his white-haired friend were among them. I sat with Varo and Lu at a small table that was intended for only two. My knees kept bumping into theirs.

“Thank you, Harper,” Lu said as she sipped on her cup of soda. “Sorry you’re trapped here, now.”

“It’s alright,” I said as I sipped my rather strong gin and tonic. “It’s part of my job,” I shrugged.

“So, you’re a *real* private investigator? That must be so fascinating,” Lu pressed on.

I laughed. “Not as much as you’d assume. I mean, it has its moments but most of the time, things are pretty straight forward. People are…predictable.”

“You’re like a real Sherlock Holmes,” Lu said more to herself than to me.

I said nothing. I hated that comparison, but I was never really sure why.

“Was I hard to find?”

“Not particularly,” I said. “The only strange part has been this town…and your motivations for going someplace so far from home.”

Lu shot a glance at Varo and then back at me. “Well, I was born here,” she said matter-of-factly. “So, I don’t think it’s that far of a stretch to assume-”

“I’m sorry, what?” I was now focused more on Varo than I was on Lu. “She was *born* here?”

“I…I may have failed to mention that detail,” was all Varo said in his defense.

“I usually call that *withholding information*.”

“You’re not a cop,” he raised an eyebrow and finished off the double-shot of whiskey he had been nursing for over an hour.

“No,” I said. “But why wouldn’t you tell me about this town? You acted like you had never heard of Judgment. You didn’t need me, you could have found Lu on your own. Why the *hell* did you bring me here?” 

At some point while I yelled at Varo, I stood up. The bar had quieted significantly by the time I finished what I had to say. Varo watched me silently. He seemed unable to come up with a suitable answer.

“Listen, Harper, I-”

“Fuck this,” I said as I walked across the now-quiet bar. 

I opened the door and rushed outside into the bitter, desert storm. Sand stung my skin but I forced myself to run towards where I had parked my car.

I found the old sedan and jumped in, starting it up quickly. It started and the air vents kicked dust and sand into the cab. I coughed and turned off the vents. I gazed out the window, realizing the visibility was just as terrible as I imagined it. 

However, I could still see the road. So, I gripped the wheel hard and pulled out onto the street.

The wind whipped around me like a monster wanting to get into my car. It howled and shook the old vehicle. The wheel tugged in my hands, the car felt like it was magnetically drawn towards the ditch. However, I refused to give into fear. I needed to get out of this wretched place.

I could only make out just enough of the road to see about twenty feet ahead of me. I stared at the wall of golden dust and hoped that it was near its end. 

I don’t know how long I drove for. Every muscle was tense as I drove through that storm, my eyes strained to see through the dusty skies. I think if I would have waited just a little longer in Judgment, I would have had a better chance. But like so many things, the odds were stacked against me. 

Judgment did not want me to leave.

Just as I was beginning to feel more comfortable with the road conditions, a giant object emerged from the dust. It was an elk. I swerved slightly to avoid hitting the animal. My right tire was suddenly caught by something on the side of the road and I lost control of the car.

My world went black.

*The entire town was there, standing under the shadow of The Watchtower. They were dressed in loose sand-colored cloaks. Their hoods were pulled up so far over their heads, I could hardly see their eyes. While their robes matched the landscape, my dress matched the giant stone behind me.*

*I stood in front of the crowd, the great white monolith behind me. I was terrified. My heart beat so fast I thought I was going to be sick or pass out. Beside me was one of the cloaked figures. He held my arm so hard, I was certain it would bruise.*

*I wasn’t listening to the words he was speaking, but the crowd seemed enraptured by whatever he was saying. I was trying desperately to see anyone I knew.* 

*Were my parents there?* 

*My friends?* 

*Would they help me?* 

*Would they stop this?*

*I got no answers to my questions.*

*“Today, our young Ophelia will walk into The Watchtower a girl and return a woman,” the man beside me said as he raised his hand upwards.*

*The crowd bowed to one knee in unison. I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I continued to search the crowd for someone, anyone to help me. At the outskirts of the group, someone was looking up under their hood. Her eyes found mine.*

*Carmen.* 

*She stared at me with the fear of a mother. But there was more than just fear in her eyes–there was anger. She clutched her young son tight against her chest. He was watching me too, confused as to what was happening.* 

*As I stared into Carmen’s eyes, I saw a tear slip down her cheek. I didn’t want her to cry. I liked Carmen. She was friends with my parents and she always invited me over to watch old movies with her son. I couldn’t understand why she was crying.*

*Beside me, the man who held my hand said, “Ophelia, do you accept the gift you have been given?”*

*“I do,” I had practiced this part a hundred times.*

*“And how will you accept it?”*

*“Under the watch of our ancestors,” I recited.*

*“From birth comes life.”*

*“And from life comes death,” I replied.*

*I had to tear my eyes away from Carmen’s. She was making me feel worse. It was an honor to be chosen.*  

*“Turn,” the man said quietly.*

I wanted to share something close to my heart. What started as a few lighthearted Facebook posts about a witty single mom with new bangs (“Tita Car”) slowly grew into something bigger — people asked for more, so I added a love interest (Miggy, the quiet architect with a coffee obsession).

One post led to another, and before I knew it, I had written *City Lights, Quiet Love* — a slow-burn romance about second chances, late-blooming love, and finding home in unexpected places.

It’s been such a wild ride turning what was just “content” into a full book, and I’d love to hear what you think. If you enjoy:  
-Cozy, coffee-themed meet-cutes  
-Slow-burn, character-driven romance  
-A strong but relatable single mom heroine  
-City lights, quiet nights, and a dash of modern humor

…then this might be up your alley!

1nmqvzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianWorkplace/comments/1nmqvzi/internship_manager_blasted_me_in_front_of/,Internship manager blasted me in front of colleagues.,"This happened a few years back. I interned at a startup during my 6th sem holidays (full time) until 3 months into 7th sem (part time) (WFO) as I didn't have classes post lunch 3 days a week. The work was in AI and it was interesting, so I'd continued to work part time.

I'd got a good offer during college placements from a reputed company. I had told my internship manager about the same and that I would not continue once the internship term ended in the next 3 weeks. In the next few days, I noticed his behaviour towards me changing - asking for updates after 10pm and throwing work at me on weekends.

I had enough one day and told him ""you cannot treat me like this"" a bit loudly in office. Forgive me, I was new to corporate and naive. That was the trigger. He started shouting at me, threatened to call the company where I had the offer and complain about me, and would contact my HOD in college.

Imagine you were in my place, as a student, managing both studies and work, going to both college and travelling 1.5 hours to office, who had spent so much time and effort doing good work, scared that he'd lose his job and what would the HOD do in college.

He regained his composure after yelling for 2-3 mins. I was shaken and stayed quiet. After a few minutes, one of my colleagues took me for a coffee and made sure I was okay. I got to know it wasn't the first time the manager shouted at an intern. The internship ended after the term, my manager's manager took care of it.

1nmqsnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1nmqsnz/explore_if_hjfcy_bleach_pen_really_works_on_tough/,Explore If HJFCY Bleach Pen Really Works on Tough Laundry Stains,"Testing out the HJFCY Bleach Pen was an interesting experience. After accidentally spilling spaghetti sauce on my favorite white shirt during lunch at the office, I figured it was the perfect opportunity to put this product to the test. The compact and portable design immediately caught my attention. It fits snugly in my bag without taking up much space, which is ideal for unpredictable messes on the go. The promise of a quick and effective stain removal process made me hopeful that my shirt could be salvaged.

**Portable Design for On-the-Go Use**  
Carrying the bleach pen around felt effortless, which is a huge win for someone like me who’s always on the move. Whether tucked in the center console of my car or my bag’s side pocket, it’s always easily accessible. Unlike bulkier stain removers or laundry supplies, having this pen at hand came in clutch more than once. The pen’s compact size lends itself to convenience, ensuring I never have to compromise cleanliness for portability.

**Easy Application and Efficiency**  
Using this stain remover was pretty straightforward, although it requires a bit of precision. You squeeze the pen gently, allowing the bleach solution to coat the tip. In my case, I dabbed the stain then used the attached brush head to spread the solution evenly. After leaving it for about 30 minutes, I rinsed the treated area under water, following the instructions. To my surprise, the stain faded significantly with minimal effort. It certainly simplified what could have been a much bigger laundry headache.

[Check HJFCY Bleach Pen price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b0dynlgvg6/)  

**Limitations for Certain Fabrics**  
Although effective, the pen comes with specific warnings. It’s only recommended for white items and explicitly cautions against use on silk, leather, mohair, and sweaters. I did test it on a smaller hidden area of another garment before committing fully, which turned out to be a wise move as the fabric color shifted uncomfortably. This limitation means it won’t work universally, so it’s essential to pay attention to the fabric guidelines. Users need to proceed cautiously, especially on mixed or delicate fabrics.

**Upsides**  
- Compact and travel-friendly design  
- Works impressively on fresh stains (spaghetti sauce, coffee, etc.)  
- Easy to apply thanks to the built-in brush head  
- Simplifies stain removal during busy schedules  

**Cons**  
- Limited use on white clothing only  
- Ineffective on certain fabric materials such as mohair and silk  
- Bleaching elements require cautious application to avoid accidental discoloration  

**Competitive Options**  
While the effectiveness of this stain remover is commendable, it's worth comparing it to peer products like Tide To-Go pens and OxiClean stain removers. The bleach pen edges ahead when it comes to removing stubborn stains from white garments, whereas Tide offers greater versatility across materials. OxiClean, on the other hand, provides bulkier solutions for home use. In terms of portability and targeted outcomes, this product positions itself as specifically advantageous for white fabric emergencies while the competition caters to more general requirements.

**Budget-Friendly Choice**  
Considering its ease of use and stain-fighting properties, the pen feels like a smart choice for the busy individual who primarily wears white. Other stain removers in this price range don’t often come with such targeted solutions. While it isn’t a universal fit for all laundry needs, its value lies in its specialty, making it a reliable and compact addition to anyone’s wardrobe arsenal.

Why it matters:

* Fewer injuries = less time hobbling around explaining how we “tweaked your back” lifting a grocery bag.
* More focus = we finally remember why you walked into the room instead of wandering aimlessly trying to remember why we walked in in the first place.
* Better recovery = we don’t feel like death every Monday.
* Consistent performance = whether it’s sports, work, or just surviving family gatherings.

I have been a little on the big side my whole life, barring a short stint in college where I was actively starving myself and did manage to lose a lot of weight, which I kept off well until I got pregnant. It has been years of trying to lose the weight again but I am struggling. 

I think I eat a pretty balanced diet, where I am really struggling is exercise, I know this because even if I had bad eating habits, a good enough exercise routine could help that. I have a toddler, so I do a lot of walking and running, and occasionally I do Yoga in the morning, but I’m not doing any quantifiable and consistent workout. I would like to start small and manageable, something like 15-20 minutes a day, but I have a toddler, so it needs to be something I can either include my toddler in or easily supervise him while I am exercising. And I would prefer to start small, something simple that won’t push me so hard I give up easily. 

So, I guess my biggest question is, what are some fun and “easy” exercises, good for someone not used to a lot of activity, preferably easy to squeeze into a daily routine, and to do with or around a toddler? Some other things of note: I have very recently quit cigarettes, it’s going well and I think I will be able to stick with it. I have PCOS, I want to put some genuine effort in before talking to my Dr, but if I go a couple months with no results, I will speak to my Dr. I am ttc baby number 2 and would prefer to get into a consistent exercise routine and lose at least some of the weight before actually becoming pregnant. And finally, my pre baby weight was 175lbs, I am currently 250lbs, I did gain much more than normal during pregnancy. 

If there’s any information I’m missing here please ask, and I am open to other non-exercise advice as well but that is the main thing I’m looking for. Thanks in advance!

ETA: According to my phone I am only averaging roughly 2k steps daily, but it is worth noting that as a SAHM I often do not have my phone on me for the whole day, only when I am out and about. Most of the time at home I leave it on the counter or table, so while I am probably not getting in enough steps, I’d wager it’s at least 2-4k higher than what my phone says. In the last 8 months I have lost about 6lbs, which isn’t nothing but I could definitely be losing it faster. Also in my personal life for the last few years I have been dealing with several overlapping stressful situations that have all resolved recently for better or worse, and the lack of impending-doom feeling has left me feeling freer and ready to make the big changes I need to, so I do think things I have tried in the past that were unsuccessful have a better chance this go around

Edit 2: I also am not great at keeping up my water intake. I have cut out like 95% of soda and sugary drinks (will only have one if I am out at a restaurant as a treat, but never at home or on the go, aside from a singular morning coffee). I know proper hydration is so important, I just struggle with it, I have tried timers, keeping bottles on hand, keeping a gallon on hand, cirkul water bottles (which helped for a long time then just kind of tapered off for some reason), flavor packets (which help but are still not great), fun cups I like, basically everything I can think of, but I still struggle pretty heavily; so if you have tips for keeping up hydration I am open to those as well.
