Yeah. That’s the vibe lately.

Over the past few years, the planet has been acting like it’s in its “main character era.” Weather is giving chaos, seasons are acting like they forgot their lines, and every week there’s a new headline that feels straight out of a Netflix apocalyptic teen drama. One day it’s 80° and sunny, next day you’re building an ark. Like—pick a lane, girl.

People in Florida are saying hurricanes are hitting earlier, harder, and with serious villain energy. Folks in California are swapping fire season for *extra fire season*. And then the Midwest? Bro, one minute they’re freezing their eyelashes off, next minute they’re sweating like they just ran a marathon they never signed up for.

And don’t even get me started on the animals. Birds are migrating like three months early, squirrels are out here looking confused (same honestly), and even ocean life is like, *“Umm why is my water so warm???”*

But here’s the wild part: despite all the chaos, communities are actually bonding in a whole new way. Neighbors helping neighbors, people sharing generators, TikTok creators teaching how to survive a heatwave with a $10 Walmart fan and pure delusion. It’s low-key wholesome.

So yeah—Earth is changing. Fast. But humans, being the stubborn little gremlins we are, keep adapting, figuring it out, and laughing through it like, “Welp, guess this is life now.”

Moral of the story?  
Stay aware, stay prepared, and maybe check the weather app twice… because Mother Nature is clearly on her experimental season and we’re all just background characters trying not to get written out.",1,1763547281.0,WritersSanctuary,2,1.0,False

# *Actual Wolf of Wall Street*  

---  

# **CHAPTER 3 — *The First Deal Lou Accidentally Closes***

It began, as most catastrophes masquerading as triumphs do, with lunch.

Lou had been on the trading floor for precisely three hours and had already learned that humans—creatures of uneven gait and baffling speech—loved to congregate near glowing boxes that spat numbers at them like taunts from a rival pack. The room was a maze of scent: colognes, fear, burnt coffee, and a desperate musk that smelled like mammals trying not to die in front of colleagues.

He wandered between desks not because he was curious about the markets, but because a young analyst had dropped a half-eaten roast beef sandwich into a trash can that was—criminally—within Lou’s line of sight. And so, with the confidence of a creature who had earned nothing but assumed everything belonged to him, he trotted toward the bin.

That was when a man in a cobalt suit intercepted him.

“Wolf! My guy!” The man slapped a stack of papers into Lou’s paws with all the ceremony of a coronation. “Take these upstairs to the Partners’ Suite, will you? They’ll only listen if you bring them.”

Lou blinked. Or did the wolf equivalent—an unblinking pause that made the man, and three nearby analysts, think he was processing deeply. Philosophically. Strategically.

“Jesus,” whispered a junior trader, “he’s *really considering it.*”

Because humans, especially the financially afflicted, are desperately eager to see intellect in any creature that looks calm under pressure, Lou was instantly credited with gravitas.

He did not carry the papers upstairs.  
He carried them to the sandwich.

But on his way, things began to happen.

A cluster of senior traders—predators in their own right—saw Lou walking confidently with a document thick enough to alter someone’s net worth. They murmured.

“That must be the cross-border credit rollup.”  
“No—those are definitely the emergency bonds from the Nordic sovereign desk.”  
“Look at how he moves. That’s someone who knows what’s inside.”

And then:  
“He’s executing the trade.”

Lou, having arrived at the trash can, dropped the papers in front of it and began sniffing the bag with the worshipful concentration of a monk regarding scripture. A managing director saw the scene from across the room and clapped his hands together.

“He’s signaling a floor-level rebalance!”

Phones were dialed.  
Orders were placed.  
Screens flickered with frenetic adjustments.

Traders at Levée Capital began buying and selling in a pattern that mirrored—almost exactly—Lou’s movements as he circled, pawed at, and eventually devoured a third of the abandoned roast beef. A senior risk officer noted the sudden spike in Nordic bonds and, rather than question why the market was being puppeted by a carnivore rummaging in refuse, simply nodded and sent authorization.

Within twelve minutes, Levée Capital had accidentally predicted a massive Scandinavian energy policy announcement that would not hit public wires until the afternoon. The firm made seventy-six million dollars before anyone even realized they were involved in a trade.

By the time Lou licked the last of the sandwich grease from his whiskers, a full-blown legend was congealing around him.

A voice carried across the floor:  
“He timed the Baltic spike. *He timed the Baltic spike.*”

Another:  
“I told you—wild instinct. Primal intuition. He’s the real thing.”

Someone printed T-shirts that read **RUN WITH THE WOLF** before the day was out. They sold out inside thirty minutes. Davos-grade fleece vests were commissioned by end of week.

Meanwhile, in the Partners’ Suite—where the ricochet of decisions made in fear or awe eventually landed—a curated narrative had already formed: the Wolf had closed a massively complex deal through a nonverbal, interpretive, market-signaling ritual.

No one mentioned the sandwich.

No one mentioned that the papers he’d been handed—now crumpled and damp near the trash—weren’t Nordic bonds or sovereign notes but a strongly worded HR memo regarding casual Friday shoe policies.

And certainly no one mentioned that Lou had no idea he’d done anything at all.

He simply wandered away from the trading floor, full and pleased, carrying with him both an accidental fortune and the first whispers of an empire built on misinterpretation.

But as any wolf—or trader—knows:

Once you convince desperate creatures that you can smell the future, they will make sure the future smells like whatever you already did.

1p13sxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p13sxz/returned_love_letter_to_avoidant/,Returned love letter to avoidant,"TL;DR

1 year relationship, both about 30. Him experienced, her no previous love or intimate experience really.

Quite intense, but chaotic too. Tried leaving her a couple of times, she wouldn't let me. She seems avoidant but opened up to me.

She ended it quite some weeks ago with a cold and mature talk, yet keeping the door open, being intimate and confused herself. Not fair to keep me warm IMO.

Respected it, no begging, let it be. After some weeks I sent a long letter from the heart, explaining personal growth, no begging no manipulation.

Got a letter in return which was warm, reminiscing, explaining I was her first love, but that she needed to ""work on herself alone"". But no ""end"" - no ""goodbye"" no ""I want to be alone"". Keeping the door open and not showing any feelings.

Felt like the letter was addressed to me but written to herself really. So, I just returned it to sender without any explanation.

\--

She’s avoidant but opened to me. Refused to let me leave the times I wanted to, and vice versa. Some weeks ago, the chaos became too much for both, resulting in her wanting to leave and end it, but fighting her heart with her head.

Mature conversation about ending it face to face, but ended up being intimate, kissing, laughing etc. Saying things like ""I’m not saying never"" etc. Keeping the door open. Saying things previously like ""I was we got a real chance"" etc. Not saying goodbye for ever.

I figured I'd be mature and respect it and said ""I'll wait for you"" which probably wasn’t a good idea to give her peace.

After a while I wrote a letter and got back said response. Returned letter. She seems confused. No previous relationship experience, almost no intimate experience. Quite lonely, no friends. Shuts down her feelings, but also afraid to say ""definitely"". Like during the breakup didn’t really want some of her items back, said I could keep them, whilst I said I don’t need them. Asked for a coffee some weeks later, got a response ""I don’t think it’s a good idea to meet right now"". Or saying things while breaking up like ""Maybe I will regret this""

Like, why don’t just say in your message, or letter ""I don’t want to see you again"" and let me move on?

Quite frustrating to ""end"" it - but leaving an open gap I constantly try to interpreter. I'm not feeling hopelessly stupid trying to analyse every word, but I'm good at reading people. Someone who wants to finish things for good doesn’t kiss right before leaving while crying, says things like ""right now"" or ""wish we had a chance"" etc. Doesn’t keep you unblocked just in case. Doesn’t reply to a letter or text or would just say ""stop sending me something"".

Now I'm just wondering what to do. No contact obviously triggers something, but its difficult moving on and having her in the back of my mind knowing she could suddenly pop in and confusing me, or me thinking ""what if"". But also scared of taking a step and scaring her off.

Something in my head kind of wants me to just approach her and tell her the truth, feeling used, lied to, kept warm for nothing, that she’s behaving just like all the people who hurt her, to me.

It’s a big trigger for her to feel like a bad person, feeling she hurt someone, feeling she used someone, knowing someone thinks bad of her, or feeling abandoned and not worth something.

Could go both ways. Already feel kind of cold for returning her letter with no explanation. I know she hasn’t and won’t be able to move on for a long time, not just dreaming. So not sure what to do.

Leave it and keep wondering

Be vulnerable one more time and saying I'm here and giving her back control

Or tell her how I feel about her maturity of doing things.

In the end I'll manage just fine - working on myself, working out, enjoying life. She doesn't have a lot of people or fun in life, which was why she got quite addicted to me. So I understand her fear of becoming ""addicted"" to me again, but in the end I'll do fine. Just my head trying to overanalyze.",1,1763547110.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

So I've been getting asked a lot lately about when's the best time to actually buy an air fryer toaster oven, and I figured I'd share what I've learned after doing way too much research on this.

**The Short Answer: Black Friday and Prime Day are your best bets**

Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. If you can wait until November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) or July (Amazon Prime Day), you'll probably save the most money. I've seen these combo units drop anywhere from 30-50% during those sales. It's honestly kind of crazy.

But here's the thing – sometimes waiting isn't realistic. I held off for months last year waiting for a deal, and my old toaster finally died. Had to buy toast from the coffee shop for two weeks like some kind of animal.

**Other Good Times to Buy**

January is actually solid too. After the holidays, retailers are trying to clear out inventory. You won't get Black Friday level discounts, but you can still find decent deals on countertop ovens and small kitchen appliances.

Spring cleaning season (March-April) sometimes has random sales too. Not guaranteed, but worth checking.

**When You Should Just Buy It Anyway**

If your current oven or toaster is broken, just get one. The money you'll save on takeout and pre-made food will make up for missing a sale. Seriously, these convection oven combos pay for themselves pretty quick when you're cooking at home more.

If you want to check current prices and see what's available, I've been using [this link](https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven) which shows a bunch of different models on Amazon. It's helpful for comparing features and seeing what's actually in stock.

**My Actual Advice**

Set a price alert if you can wait. But if you're ready to start air frying and need it now, don't stress too much about timing. A good quality air fryer toaster oven will last you years, so even paying full price isn't the end of the world.

I bought mine in August (terrible timing, I know) and I still use it literally every single day. No regrets.

The key is knowing what size you need and which features actually matter to you before you start shopping. That way when a sale hits, you can grab it fast. [Check out the different options here](https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven) so you know what you're looking for when the time comes.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have questions.",1,1763547003.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

Please take a moment to read this. This story has a lot of plot twist. Also, please share your thoughts. Everyone is welcome to send me a dm. 

So ayun, nakilala ko yung guy at sobrang thankful ko kasi nag-end agad ng maaga. One month pa lang kami at I have no regrets at all naman. Bumalik siya sa ex niyang 4 times cheater at dahil iyon daw yung pinagkakatiwalaan ng parents niya pagdating sa utang (yes, his utang and everything will be unfolded later). Sobrang fault ko, kasi two-weeks pa lang silang break noong time na nagkakilala kami at pinaghawakan ko yung sinabi niya na ayaw na raw niya doon sa ex na nakabalikan niya.

Nagsimula lahat 'to nung nawala siya ng two days (at birthday pa niya). It was November 5, 2025 at birthday rin ng kapatid ko at plano namin ng buong fam na kumain ng dinner sa labas. Before that day din, nagkaroon kami ng misunderstanding at gusto niyang makipagkita para ayusin. Noong araw din na yun, sobrang daming nangyari sa araw ko. I need to take an assessment exam sa government na papasukan ko. Sobrang nakakapagod at drained ako kaya sabi ko ay next time na lang but he still insists. Sinabi niya sa'kin that night ""diyan lang ako sa tabi-tabi para mabilis kitang mapuntahan kapag naisipan mong makipagkita after ng family dinner niyo"". Okay naman sa'kin at sinabihan ko pa siya sa mag-iingat.

  
Later that day, ito na yung araw na sobrang hindi ako makatulog at kulang na lang kainin ako ng lupa dahil hindi ko alam gagawin ko. Dumating na sa point na yung pinsan, kaibigan, at ex (yes yung binalikan niya), ay nagcha-chat na sa'kin at nagtatanong kung magkasama ba raw kami. Aware sila na may bago siyang dine-date dahil sa Instagram posts na minention niya'ko. Sa part ko, hindi ko alam ang sasabihin dahil hindi ko naman talaga alam kung nasaan siya. Nandoon yung kaba ko na ako yung magiging person of interest kung ano man ang mangyari sa kaniya kasi dapat magkikita kami pero hindi ako puwede that day. 

  
Dalawang araw na yung nakakalipas at sobrang hindi ako nakakatulog. Palagi kong in-update yung friend at pinsan niya kung nakita na ba. Boom! Ayun na nga, nakita na raw ng November 07 at 8pm. Noong nalaman ko na nakita siya at active na sa IG, tinawagan ko siya agad. Plot twist: Yung ex niya yung may hawak ng phone. Siyempre nandoon yung nginig at takot. Tinanong ko agad siya kung kamusta si \*\* at unang bungad siya sa'kin is ""Alam mo bang may addiction sa pagsusugal si \*toot\*?. Nakita namin siya sa Solaire Trinoma at nakatulala. Kaya hindi siya ma-kontak dahil sinangla niya yung phone niya sa mga nagsusugal din doon."". T\*NG INA! Sobrang na-shock ako sa revelation. Ending, humaba-haba yung usapan namin ng ex niya kasi sobrang friendly ko at he was actually amazed kasi hindi raw ako war freak na magtatanong ng ""Bakit hawak mo phone ni \*toot\*"", etc. Sinabi ko na lang na ang gusto ko lang naman malaman is kung okay ba siya. In-explain niya rin sa'kin na siya may hawak ng phone niya kasi di ba may mga online gambling sa phone at yung access is nasa sim card.

November 08, 2025 pumunta agad ako sa kanila para kausapin siya. Wala akong maayos na tulog at lutang na lutang. Pagdating ko sa bahay nila, yung mama at papa niya yung nakita ko. Ang pakilala ko is kaibigan since hindi hindi kasi siya open sa family niya (pero I know for sure na aware sila sa identity ni \*toot\* kasi yung ex niya agad yung unang nilapitan ng mama at papa niya para hanapin siya.) Pagka-baba niya ng hagdanan, sobrang naiiyak na ako. Niyaya ni agad ako ng umakyat sa taas para mag-usap. Then pagpasok namin ng pintuan, \*slap\* at sinampal ko agad siya. Hindi lang isang beses kundi sobrang dami. Mahaba-haba usapan namin. Dumating ako sa kanila ng 3pm at nakaalis na ako ng midnight. Nakausap ko rin yung kasambahay at mama niya which is naging close ko kaagad sa sobrang pagiging friendly ko. Mas lalong na nung nalaman ko na bisaya pala yung kasambahay. Nag usap kaming tatlo sa mismong bahay ng kasambahay nila which is two-houses lang ang gap. Tbh, sobrang nagulat ako kasi out of nowhere nag-open sa'kin mama niya na hindi nga raw open si \*toot\* sa kanila at wala silang idea sa sexual orientation niya. Humihingi ng advice si tita sa'kin kung ano araw puwedeng gawin. ALSO, DALAWANG BESES NA NIYANG GINAWA 'TO AT PARENTS NIYA ANG NAGBABAYAD NG UTANG NIYA AT HINDI RIN NAMAN GANUN KALAKI YUNG KINIKITA NG FAMILY BUSINESS NILA. Siyempre nagbigay ako ng payo. Sinabi rin ng mama niya na kilalanin ko pa raw si \*toot\*. Ang payo naman ng kasambahay is kausap-kausapin ko raw para hindi ma-stress which is okay naman sa'kin kasi usual naman naming ginagawa na mag-usap gabi-gabi.

Days has passed, araw-araw kong pinapa-feel sa kaniya na nandiyan ako. Dumating sa point na after ko magpa-medical is dumiretso ako sa kanila para magdala ng grocery kasi panay junk foods yung kinakain niya gabi-gabi. Take note: BUMABAGYO that time at nag-commute ako papunta sa kanila. Di ba? Sobra na sa effort. Tiyaka isa pa, siya yung nanliligaw sa'kin pero siyempre dahil gusto ko yung isang tao, mag e-effort din ako.

  
After a few days, nagsabi ako sa kaniya na nag-uusap kami ng ex niya (before maging sila ulit), sinabi ko na siguro magiging okay ka sa ka niya etc. etc. Tapos sabi niya sa'kin, ""Bakit mo naman ako pinapamigay? Hindi na ako babalik doon. Sa 4 years namin, apat na beses ng nagloko yun. Wala lang yun mahanap na matino kausap kaya kung babalik man yun ay ayoko na"". Pinanghawakan ko yung sinabi niya. Nai-kuwento rin niya sa'kin na sa 3rd cheating pa lang ni Doc (yes, he is a dentist lol) ay nakipag-break na si \*toot\* at may nakakausap na siyang iba . Dahil si kup@l na doctor na'to ay nagseselos, bumalik si g@go at hiniwalayan niya yung nakaka-getting to know each other niya. Lahat yung pinanghawakan ko. 

  
Ito lang recently November 13, 2025. Naging honest ako sa kaniya at sinabi ko sa kaniya na be transparent next time. Sinabi sa'kin ng ex niya na humihingi siya ng 5th chance kay \*toot\* para ayusin lahat. Tapos itong kup\*l na'to, wala pang balak sabihin kung hindi ko pa ino-open up. Di ba since humihingi ng chance 'tong kup@l na doctor at wala siyang balak sabihin sa'kin ay gusto niya pang pagsabayin kami. Para kapag hindi sila nag-work, ako yung sasalo sa kaniya. \*TIGNAN NIYO NA LANG YUNG SCREENSHOTS DAHIL YAN YUNG SINABI NIYA SA'KIN THAT DAY\*. Masasabi niyo na parang decided na talaga siya at gaslighting to the max yung atake. Sinabi niya sa'kin na dahil si doc daw yung una niyang nakita sa solaire. Which is sobrang g@go di ba? Kung alam ko lang kung saan ka hahanapin, malamang ako rin yung unang makakakita sa'yo. At malamang alam niya kung saan ka hahanapin kasi PAREHAS KAYONG NAGSUSUGAL. Na-kuwento sa'kin ni \*toot\* na minsan nagsusugal nga sila ni doc minsan sa Okada at Wyndford para doon kumuha ng pang-date. Which is sa'kin alam nila na hindi ako marunong magsugal. Ang alam ko lang is unggoy-ungguyan. At everytime na nagsusugal yung mga kapitbahay namin, hindi nila kami pinapalapit para manood. 

  
Hinayaan ko na sila. Pero last Sunday lang, birthday naman ng mama ko (parehas silang November ng kapatid ko) at kumain din kami sa labas. Eh saktong unlimited yung alak sa Viking's kaya uminom ako. Kasama ko rin girlfriend ng kapatid ko, at nag open up ako sa kaniya. Siyempre lasing at pag-uwi namin ng bahay, I decided to tell him everything, as in lahat. Sinabi ko sa kaniya na kung reason lang is yung kup@l na doctor na iyon yung taga-compute ng utang niya, sabi ko na kaya ko rin naman gawin yun ah. Sinabihan ko rin siya na susunod huwag silang manggagamit ng ibang tao especially kapag emotionally unstable silang dalawa. At ito pa yung plost twist: Sinasabi ni Doc kay \*toot\* na single raw siya pero ibang-iba yung kuwento niya kanila tita at sa kasambahay na may boyfriend na raw siya (ito yung time na hinahanap namin siya). Sinabi ko yun sa kaniya pero tahimik lang siya. Tinanong ko ulit siya, ano ba talaga yung pinaka-reason kung bakit niya binigyan ng chance si doc for the 5th times? May sinabi siya sa'kin na hindi pa raw niya kayang sabihin. Sinasabi niya sa'kin na mapapatawad niya raw ako hindi ngayon pero baka sa future. And what the f\*ck? Plano mong bumalik sa'kin? Sinabi ko rin na dinelete ko na lahat ng photos namin together which is bakit ko raw dinelete.

Hanggang ngayon, nakikipag-chismisan pa rin ako sa kasambahay nila to ask for an update. Ayun, binigyan naman niya naman ako ng payo na mag-move on na at gumagawa raw talaga si Lord ng way para maiwas ka sa gulo. Huwag ko rin daw ibigay lahat ng effort. Sinabi niya sa'kin na good-looking ka naman at for sure makakahanap ka ng taong magmamahal sa'yo. Actually guys, maraming mga nagchat-chat at nagpaparamdam sa'kin pero wala akong ine-entertain na kahit sino kasi gusto kong mag-settle na. Alam ni \*toot\* lahat ng mga pumo-porma sa'kin kasi nahahawakan niya phone ko at nakikita niya yung mga messages sa Facebook at Instagram. I am 25 years old and graduated taking Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management. Kaya nagtataka talaga ako sa kung ano pa yung deeper reason kung bakit niya binigyan ng chance si doc na 4th times na nag-chat. Nga pala, na-mention ni doc na late bloomer siya at nasa exploration stage pa. First boyfriend din ni doc si \*toot\* kaya rin siguro mahirap bitawan. AT HINDI RIN SIGURO SILA NAGWO-WORK NG MGA NAKAKAUSAP NIYA KAYA BUMABALIK SA'MIN. 

Nag-kuwento sa'kin yung kasambahay nila na nagse-selos nga raw si doc sa'min kaya nakikipagbalikan kay \*toot\*. Dumating rin kami sa point na nagtatanong na yung kasambahay kung utang lang ba ni \*toot\* yung binabayaran ng mga magulang niya since na-mention ko rin magkasabay silang magsugal sa casino. Ang g@go lang sa part na noong nakikipag kuwentuhan ako kay doc noong time na siya ang nakasagot is nasasaktan daw siya kapag nakikita si \*toot\* sa mga ginawa sa kaniya. Parehas silang kup@l haha. Tbh, naging rebound na rin before at almost three months din yun. Pero this time hindi na masakit to be honest kasi isang buwan lang naman. Si Doc is 30 years old na nasa exploration stage pa at si \*toot\* naman is 36 years old na. Parehas silang immature. Before pa lang, I am into older guys na kasi yung ex ko is sa kaniya rin ako nag-mature as a man of today. Almost 5 years rin pala kami ng ex ko. 

  
2025 has taught me a lot. I will take a break na muna siguro at focus muna ulit sa career. Two years and five months na akong single ngayon at apat (4) na tao na rin yung dumating sa buhay ko this year lang din. Sarili ko muna. Not unless may unexpected di ba? What if mag-rely sa organic encounter? haha. Gusto ko rin mag-stick sa isa and not into games na. Recently, I am into reading books and coffee (Americano or Cold Brew) lol. Sobrang na e-enjoy ko. Na-realised ko rin na nandiyan mama ko at kapatid ko. Katatapos ko lang din pala tapusin yung book titled, 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck"". Nakatulong din sa'kin yung book na yun to move-on. Ang binabasa ko na ngayon is ""ATOMIC HABITS"". Suggests kayo ng magandang books please? Mas preferable ko yung mga psychology or self-healing books, please?

I am someone who is born and raised in Chongqing, and I often see itineraries that only stick to Jiefangbei and Hongya Cave. While those are great, the ""Mountain City"" has so many distinct neighborhoods that offer totally different vibes—from Cyberpunk nightlife to quiet historical trails.

I curated a list of 6 ""Featured Streets"" (风情街区) that I usually recommend to my clients who want to dig a bit deeper. I’ve included the vibe check and Metro directions for each to help you navigate.

Hope this helps your planning!

# 📸 For the Views & ""Mountain City"" Terrain

*If you want to understand why Chongqing is called the City of Mountains.*

**1. Mountain City Alley (Shancheng Xiang | 山城巷)**

* **The Vibe:** A 1.5km trail clinging to a cliffside. It feels very authentic and leads to the old city wall. At night, lanterns light up the path with the river in the background.
* **🚇 Metro:** Line 1 or 2 to **Jiaochangkou Station**, Exit 5.

**2. Daijia Alley (戴家巷)**

* **The Vibe:** Located right next to the famous Hongya Cave, but much better for a leisurely hike. It’s built on the cliffside south of the Jialing River. Great for hiking down the ""suspended"" paths and finding a quiet cafe with a view.
* **🚇 Metro:** Line 2 to **Linjiangmen Station**.

**3. Shibati Traditional Landscape Area (十八梯)**

* **The Vibe:** Recently renovated, this area connects the upper and lower halves of the city. It preserves the steep, rugged terrain and traditional ""stilted"" architecture.
* **🚇 Metro:** Line 1 or 2 to **Jiaochangkou Station**.



# 🎞️ For the Artsy, Hipster & ""Cyberpunk"" Crowd

*For the photographers and influencers.*

**4. Testbed 2 (贰厂)**

* **The Vibe:** Adjacent to Eling Park (and famously used in the movie *I Belonged to You*). It’s an industrial park turned artsy hub. The rooftop offers a stunning 360-degree view of the city.
* **🚇 Metro:** Line 1 to **Eling Station**, Exit 2A.

**5. 9st. (Jiujie | 九街)**

* **The Vibe:** This is ""Cyber Chongqing."" The heart of the nighttime economy. If you want to party or see the city neon-lit and awake at 3 AM, this is the place.
* **🚇 Metro:** Line 6 to **Hongtudi Station**, Exit 3.

**6. Ecool (重庆金山意库)**

* **The Vibe:** A creative park near the IKEA/Outlets area. It’s full of design studios, galleries, and unique furniture shops. Very modern and artistic.
* **🚇 Metro:** Line 10 to **Minxinjiayuan Station** (Exit 1) OR Line 3 to **Jinyu Station** (Exit 3).

**7. Ziwei Road (紫薇路)**

* **The Vibe:** Known locally as ""Little Bangkok."" It’s a very walkable block with a high density of bistros, craft beer bars, and bakeries. Great for ""Day Coffee, Night Alcohol"" (早A晚C).
* **🚇 Metro:** Line 6 to **Huangnibang Station**.



# 🏛️ For History & Culture Buffs

*Old architecture and stories.*

**8. Longmenhao Old Street (龙门浩老街)**

* **The Vibe:** Located on Nanbin Road, this area preserves historical Western-style buildings (like the old U.S. Embassy). It has a **free glass observation deck** over the street.

He does ask lots of questions (but to ME it feels like he's just asking them because he doesn't want to make the situation awkward and silent) and keeps saying things like 'let's meet up again next week', 'I'll buy dinner next week'... This is our 2nd time having coffee/dinner outside of work and honestly this time was pretty disappointing.

I just find it funny how he'd say something like the above when it's clearly not looking good. The first time we hung out was kinda fun because he seemed enthusiastic and confident, but this time he just seemed low-energy and gave me regretting vibes 'Ah, I shouldn't have asked to meet up with her'.  This is all speculation of course, but we humans have what's called instinct and intuition and this is what I'm getting.

1p13lc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1p13lc9/please_help_me_cook_healthier_food_for_my/,Please help me cook healthier food for my autistic husband.,"I am autistic myself but I also just hate all food and force myself to eat a pretty well calculated mix of all needed nutrients and an excess on fiber. I do however like cooking and baking a lot. 

  
My husband on the other hand only knows how to:  
boil eggs  
microwave something prepped or microwave meals  
toast toast and eat it plain because it's too much effort to do anything with  
boil water in the kettle for 5 minute noodles (he only eats the noodles, no adding packets) and tea

Before I was around his parents didn't care about his sensory needs and he would eat junkfood all day and considered mixing flour mixed with warm water and eating the resulting paste a home cooked meal.

  
When I don't eat for a day or two I get mental clarity, etc.   
He loves eating and If he doesn't eat for a few hours he gets extremely irritable and incredibly toxic to be around. He snacks constantly in secret and I find whole empty bags of packages in our bedroom or bathroom. This wouldn't be much of  a problem if he wasn't starting to struggle with obesity. I am very concerned for his health. When we met he was a very healthy and built and now he is extremely flabby and has larger breasts than me. He is extremely self deprecating about it and it's bad for his mental health. He also suffers severe digestive issues from presumably lack of fibre. He often spends several hours a day on the toilet and expresses extreme discomfort. 

He much prefers drinking soda which I have put a system in place to cut that out 95% of the time. He likes KFC tenders and McDonalds fries and chicken nuggets. When I get boba when in the city he will get a plain tea with lots of sugar. He also eats certain pizza at fast food chains. Beyond this it is impossible to eat out anywhere because he will say it either smells too much like food or coffee or it looks too fancy. 

He only really likes a few things and none of them honestly count as cooking unfortunately:

Seared meat - Preferably lamb, sometimes he asks for steak - only with salt, pepper and a little paprika, no other spices or sauces  
super market cheap frozen tenders crisped in the oven  
Crispy plain Bacon.   
Omelette cooked in unflavored plain oil like canola in a clean pan. Or boiled and peeled eggs.   
Pizza from supermarket pizza base with just sauce, cheese and ham and egg (it's called Aussie pizza apparently)   
Plain Pasta - potentially with salt or butter, Plain fluffy white rice  
Grilled cheese - only square white bread - potentially with crispy bacon and butter.   
Brine boiled potatoes - a german recipe I introduced him to.   
He loves plain white bread, cheap supermarket house-brand peanut butter sandwiches. He requests these every day and sometimes several times a day. 

HE DOES NOT TOLERATE WHEN THESE ARE CUT INTO SMALL PIECES AND ESPECIALLY NOT IF THEY ARE MIXED - THEY ARENT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING OR HE WILL LEAVE THAT PART BEHIND ON THE PLATE ENTIRELY AND MAKE DISGUSTED FACES WHILE EATING WHICH I IMAGINE RUINS THE EXPERIENCE FOR HIM. 

  
He doesn't like but will tolerate when served with food he already accepts:  
Sweet potato (ONLY RAW) in slices.   
RAW carrot with the ends cut off  
Spinach and other leaves 

He will always eat them first, treat it like a chore and leave a lot of them on the plate i(unfortunately he takes so long his main meal tends to go completely cold and I feel bad for him so I tend to give him less of these)

He has basically flat out refused to touch all other meals me or his parents have cooked so far.

Outside of this he constantly snacks on bread, candy, sometimes plain sugar or syrups, crackers, noodles, etc. Sometimes dry pasta. It's honestly very concerning when I buy cookies for a whole gathering of friends the next day and 5 minutes later I open the cupboard again and only find empty packages and crumbs. 

  
My biggest issue is he never tells me that he prefers anything in any way - he will just look mopey and finish even less of the meal than usual (he always leaves at least around 10% on the plate because he doesn't feel it is worth picking up) or do his standard routine or just refuse to eat entirely without touching the food. When I ask him he will just call everything different and incomparable. 

Please help me figure out how cook things for him that he will actually eat and that will help him lose weight and digest things better. Please help me make him happy and healthy. I love my husband very much and I don't know what else to do anymore so I came here in desperation as my last resort. ",0,1763546395.0,Cooking,2,0.14,False

1p13gaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p13gaz/arc_raiders_and_its_usage_of_ai/,Arc Raiders and its usage of AI,"This is a kind of long winded review I guess on how Arc Raiders uses AI, however I'd like to put forth some background information on myself as a lot of this is my own opinion.

I am a 20 year old writer, even finished a course at my university for creative writing and currently studying Journalism. I do not have a background in AI, nor am I very well versed in its inner workings, so if there is anything I get wrong do correct me.

I am very much so against the usage the usage of Generative AI and AI voice acting in art work, and if it was up to me then it wouldn't be in this game at all, however it is. And, to give embark credit, they are probably the only gaming company I know of that is incredibly deliberate in their way of using it, I have about 400 hours on the Finals put in since launch and the usage of AI voice lines there very much so streamlines their work focus, plus it is something that does match the setting as well. Embark themselves have said that they wish AI to be a tool to augment human creativity, not as a replacement and I do not have any reason to believe otherwise.

Within this post I will be focusing on the usage of AI voice work and the voice changer,

Now then, onto Arc Raiders and AI.

# Voice Changer.

The Voice Modulator is honestly an incredible tool to have. It allows significant self expression from a variety of people, including those who are disabled. I can imagine a great deal of transgender people would love a tool such as this, to be able to express themselves the way they'd like to online, and even just for roleplaying purposes it is great. It also allows people to have an extra layer of anonymity, helping those shy players speak up, alongside younger kids and especially women who often times are targets of online abuse simply for existing as they are.  
There seriously is not a single flaw with this tool, this is an incredible feat for a game and more games should absolutely implement this.

# AI voice work - The Raiders

This is where my opinion gets a little bit more mixed, however I would like to give it credit first; Having an incredibly precise pinging system where the voice line says out exactly what the thing is, where it is, etc, is quite handy. Other games have you ping a location and your character will say ""Over there"", Arc Raiders has your raider say ""Over by the building"" or ""Next to that car"". It's quite useful, and much like the previous statement it allows players who do not use a mic to still communicate effectively, which is great for situations such as a language barrier, mutism or simply no desire to speak.  
This does come at a cost however, although it certainly isn't anything major. What it leaves behind is a sense of expression from your Raider. There is no personality in your character that isn't directly injected in by you (either through proxim mic or through your customisation), which just feels like a waste of an opportunity.  
Is this the end of the world, something terrible and you should boycott?  
Nah. Just a wasted opportunity, and even then what we have in game is useful and effective in its own right. It's a minor complaint from me at best, and some would even say a nitpick.

# 

# AI voice work - The Traders

Now this is where a lot of my grievances come in.  
I read an interview with Embarks CEO about their usage of AI, and what I got from it was that in order to compete with the top dogs of the gaming industry, they are going to have to find a way to streamline their work and make games effectively. With their massive success with The Finals in 2023 and now Arc Raiders in 2025, I'd say that philosophy has certainly paid off.  
The way Embark does their AI voice work (from what I can find online however I have not seen anything official from Embark so this could be all misinformation) is that they have an inhouse model that they pay their voice actors to give their character voice to, doing actual voice lines for the game of course but also allowing AI voice lines to be used based off the voice lines they gave, essentially a TTS program with extra steps. I am kind of sure that these voice actors get royalties for their work, even if it is TTS, which if so is fairly worker friendly. So for example, Scotty and June in the Finals. Their VA's have voiced lines for the game, however also they have allowed Embark to use these voice lines as a basis for lines generated by their AI model. They got a payment for their work and, again unconfirmed, I assume royalties for giving their likeness away, much like how actors will receive royalties for a film they did.  
The way Embark does this in the Finals is, in my opinion, suitable (Again, I would prefer actual human voice lines but that's not reality). The Finals is a virtual game show that is acting almost like a distraction from the background lore which basically tells us ""Yo the world is FUCKED"", so having AI voice lines in the game is quite suitable for the environment it is set in. In lore, Scotty and June probably are just AI's made to react to the game so having some of their voice work be AI lines fits the setting fantastically, some could even say it works better that way from an artistic standpoint which I see the merit of as well.

I bring up Scotty and June because they fit two criteria; they have AI lines and they are major characters within the game.  
In Arc Raiders, the other people that fit this bill are the Traders, however it is a lot different in my opinion there.

Arc Raiders is a game about man vs AI, humanity rising up after literally being driven underground to take out their AI / Machine oppressors and take back the Earth. The world and lore is incredibly interesting and the art style is just, breath taking. A lot of work went into this game, even if it is fairly story light.  
These themes are also represented in each character. Celeste is the kind and compassionate leader, very HUMAN (I'll get back to this one later).  
Shani is the overworked and hyper focused no nonsense security leader, ensuring that the people of Speranza get as much as an advantage as they can.  
Tian Wen is this almost hostile viper of a person, begrudgingly dealing with people for business but clearly has a lot going on under the hood.  
Lance is a sarcastic and charming Android with no name, hiding his fear of not knowing his past behind his cool exterior (The man is literally wearing sunglasses and has a life vest on, he is hiding his fear and trying to stay afloat above it. The character designers for him got to win an award for it, it's so good).  
And Apollo is the friendly and guiding explosives expert, telling you to stay away from the half safe explosives in the same tone of voice he'd tell you that the coffee pot was still hot.

These characters are all incredibly human, and the entire direction behind Toledo / Speranza, the Traders, us as the Raiders and everything else around it is so...Human. Speranza looks like an underground old european city (or at least this Australians view of what he thinks a European city looks like), our Raiders adorn themselves in unique and interesting outfits with accessories galore, our guns are half made out of the enemy and the other half made out of the neighbours piping, look the whole point I am trying to make is that the human aspect and the machine aspect is incredibly loud. The art work speaks for itself.

So, when the Man vs Machine story has the Man be voiced by the Machine, it almost undermines all of that. And I think Celeste is by far the worst example of it. Almost all of her lines sound dull and flat, soulless. This kind and benevolent leader who LITERALLY TAKES SEEDS FROM US TO GROW FOOD AS A CURRENCY (the devs cannot be more on the nose of the type of person she is with this) sounds like a robot 90% of the time. But then you get the occasional cutscene with her and all of a sudden, she sounds human. She compassionately gives Tian Wen her mothers patch, she talks about the flags raised during the first wave. Where was this before in the 10 or so quests I did for her?

Now if this was for character like Lance, it would be a Scotty and June situation again, in which it matches the character and their placement in the setting. But not with our traders.

I am not sure if the other traders have AI voice lines however what I can say is that Lance and Tian Wen always have the best performances. You can taste the viper on Tian Wens tongue, and smell the insecurity in Lance when he talks about other androids in Stella perhaps knowing more about him. You don't get that in Celeste.

Now, to bring things back to that interview I mentioned earlier, I have no doubt that doing this helps make content faster, and ultimately the game is a game primarily focused on its gameplay cycle (game, game, game. Word looks weird now).  
However, as an artist myself I can't help but think that maybe this wasn't the right move by Embark, that using these AI voicelines only undermine the whole message of the game, that being human triumph even in the face of desolate odds, including each other.

Perhaps they are planning on replacing these voice lines with actual voice acting over time, instead focusing on the game first.  
But with the lack of transparency when it comes to what lines are and aren't AI, it has lead to me second guessing every delivery from every character. ""Is this AI or just an awkward line?"".

At the end of it all, I think the usage of AI voice lines for the Raiders is effective at the end of the day, and very much so a good move with their philosophy.  
But the traders? The human characters that drive the story and world? I don't think they should have allowed AI voice line implementation for anything more than small talk.

I do hope that, at the very least the cutscenes will still be voice acted as well as more important quests, as if AI voice lines remain to just be the more small talk / fodder quests it certainly is a lot more acceptable, with the aforementioned lack of transparency on how they will implement it in the future, it all future voice lines will be AI or will the VA's return, etc etc. I just don't think it was the right move to make, from an artistic standpoint.

# 

# Conclusion.

Is Embark a company that will use AI to replace humans forever? No. I do think they mean it when it comes to them using it as an augment for human creativity. I personally may be ""old fashioned"" but clearly it works considering I have about 400 hours on the finals and about 30 on Arc Raiders. And there are genuine benefits to using it. It has allowed Embark to contend with heavy hitters of the industry and keep up, it allows more player expression and accessibility. But there must be a point where the line must be drawn, where the artistic integrity of the product suffers more than it is worth with the cost cutting.

I am a 20 year old writer, even finished a course at my university for creative writing and currently studying Journalism. I do not have a background in AI, nor am I very well versed in its inner workings, so if there is anything I get wrong do correct me.

I am very much so against the usage the usage of Generative AI and AI voice acting in art work, and if it was up to me then it wouldn't be in this game at all, however it is. And, to give embark credit, they are probably the only gaming company I know of that is incredibly deliberate in their way of using it, I have about 400 hours on the Finals put in since launch and the usage of AI voice lines there very much so streamlines their work focus, plus it is something that does match the setting as well. Embark themselves have said that they wish AI to be a tool to augment human creativity, not as a replacement and I do not have any reason to believe otherwise.

Within this post I will be focusing on the usage of AI voice work and the voice changer, 

Now then, onto Arc Raiders and AI.

# Voice Changer.

The Voice Modulator is honestly an incredible tool to have. It allows significant self expression from a variety of people, including those who are disabled. I can imagine a great deal of transgender people would love a tool such as this, to be able to express themselves the way they'd like to online, and even just for roleplaying purposes it is great. It also allows people to have an extra layer of anonymity, helping those shy players speak up, alongside younger kids and especially women who often times are targets of online abuse simply for existing as they are.   
There seriously is not a single flaw with this tool, this is an incredible feat for a game and more games should absolutely implement this.



# AI voice work - The Raiders

This is where my opinion gets a little bit more mixed, however I would like to give it credit first; Having an incredibly precise pinging system where the voice line says out exactly what the thing is, where it is, etc, is quite handy. Other games have you ping a location and your character will say ""Over there"", Arc Raiders has your raider say ""Over by the building"" or ""Next to that car"". It's quite useful, and much like the previous statement it allows players who do not use a mic to still communicate effectively, which is great for situations such as a language barrier, mutism or simply no desire to speak.   
This does come at a cost however, although it certainly isn't anything major. What it leaves behind is a sense of expression from your Raider. There is no personality in your character that isn't directly injected in by you (either through proxim mic or through your customisation), which just feels like a waste of an opportunity.   
Is this the end of the world, something terrible and you should boycott?   
Nah. Just a wasted opportunity, and even then what we have in game is useful and effective in its own right. It's a minor complaint from me at best, and some would even say a nitpick. 

# 

# AI voice work - The Traders

Now this is where a lot of my grievances come in.   
I read an interview with Embarks CEO about their usage of AI, and what I got from it was that in order to compete with the top dogs of the gaming industry, they are going to have to find a way to streamline their work and make games effectively. With their massive success with The Finals in 2023 and now Arc Raiders in 2025, I'd say that philosophy has certainly paid off.   
The way Embark does their AI voice work (from what I can find online however I have not seen anything official from Embark so this could be all misinformation) is that they have an inhouse model that they pay their voice actors to give their character voice to, doing actual voice lines for the game of course but also allowing AI voice lines to be used based off the voice lines they gave, essentially a TTS program with extra steps. I am kind of sure that these voice actors get royalties for their work, even if it is TTS, which if so is fairly worker friendly. So for example, Scotty and June in the Finals. Their VA's have voiced lines for the game, however also they have allowed Embark to use these voice lines as a basis for lines generated by their AI model. They got a payment for their work and, again unconfirmed, I assume royalties for giving their likeness away, much like how actors will receive royalties for a film they did.   
The way Embark does this in the Finals is, in my opinion, suitable (Again, I would prefer actual human voice lines but that's not reality). The Finals is a virtual game show that is acting almost like a distraction from the background lore which basically tells us ""Yo the world is FUCKED"", so having AI voice lines in the game is quite suitable for the environment it is set in. In lore, Scotty and June probably are just AI's made to react to the game so having some of their voice work be AI lines fits the setting fantastically, some could even say it works better that way from an artistic standpoint which I see the merit of as well.

I bring up Scotty and June because they fit two criteria; they have AI lines and they are major characters within the game.  
In Arc Raiders, the other people that fit this bill are the Traders, however it is a lot different in my opinion there.

Arc Raiders is a game about man vs AI, humanity rising up after literally being driven underground to take out their AI / Machine oppressors and take back the Earth. The world and lore is incredibly interesting and the art style is just, breath taking. A lot of work went into this game, even if it is fairly story light.   
These themes are also represented in each character. Celeste is the kind and compassionate leader, very HUMAN (I'll get back to this one later).   
Shani is the overworked and hyper focused no nonsense security leader, ensuring that the people of Speranza get as much as an advantage as they can.   
Tian Wen is this almost hostile viper of a person, begrudgingly dealing with people for business but clearly has a lot going on under the hood.  
Lance is a sarcastic and charming Android with no name, hiding his fear of not knowing his past behind his cool exterior (The man is literally wearing sunglasses and has a life vest on, he is hiding his fear and trying to stay afloat above it. The character designers for him got to win an award for it, it's so good).  
And Apollo is the friendly and guiding explosives expert, telling you to stay away from the half safe explosives in the same tone of voice he'd tell you that the coffee pot was still hot. 

These characters are all incredibly human, and the entire direction behind Toledo / Speranza, the Traders, us as the Raiders and everything else around it is so...Human. Speranza looks like an underground old european city (or at least this Australians view of what he thinks a European city looks like), our Raiders adorn themselves in unique and interesting outfits with accessories galore, our guns are half made out of the enemy and the other half made out of the neighbours piping, look the whole point I am trying to make is that the human aspect and the machine aspect is incredibly loud. The art work speaks for itself. 

So, when the Man vs Machine story has the Man be voiced by the Machine, it almost undermines all of that. And I think Celeste is by far the worst example of it. Almost all of her lines sound dull and flat, soulless. This kind and benevolent leader who LITERALLY TAKES SEEDS FROM US TO GROW FOOD AS A CURRENCY (the devs cannot be more on the nose of the type of person she is with this) sounds like a robot 90% of the time. But then you get the occasional cutscene with her and all of a sudden, she sounds human. She compassionately gives Tian Wen her mothers patch, she talks about the flags raised during the first wave. Where was this before in the 10 or so quests I did for her? 

Now if this was for character like Lance, it would be a Scotty and June situation again, in which it matches the character and their placement in the setting. But not with our traders. 

I am not sure if the other traders have AI voice lines however what I can say is that Lance and Tian Wen always have the best performances. You can taste the viper on Tian Wens tongue, and smell the insecurity in Lance when he talks about other androids in Stella perhaps knowing more about him. You don't get that in Celeste.

Now, to bring things back to that interview I mentioned earlier, I have no doubt that doing this helps make content faster, and ultimately the game is a game primarily focused on its gameplay cycle (game, game, game. Word looks weird now).   
However, as an artist myself I can't help but think that maybe this wasn't the right move by Embark, that using these AI voicelines only undermine the whole message of the game, that being human triumph even in the face of desolate odds, including each other. 

Perhaps they are planning on replacing these voice lines with actual voice acting over time, instead focusing on the game first.   
But with the lack of transparency when it comes to what lines are and aren't AI, it has lead to me second guessing every delivery from every character. ""Is this AI or just an awkward line?"". 

At the end of it all, I think the usage of AI voice lines for the Raiders is effective at the end of the day, and very much so a good move with their philosophy.   
But the traders? The human characters that drive the story and world? I don't think they should have allowed AI voice line implementation for anything more than small talk. 

I do hope that, at the very least the cutscenes will still be voice acted as well as more important quests, as if AI voice lines remain to just be the more small talk / fodder quests it certainly is a lot more acceptable, with the aforementioned lack of transparency on how they will implement it in the future, it all future voice lines will be AI or will the VA's return, etc etc. I just don't think it was the right move to make, from an artistic standpoint. 

# 

# Conclusion.

Is Embark a company that will use AI to replace humans forever? No. I do think they mean it when it comes to them using it as an augment for human creativity. I personally may be ""old fashioned"" but clearly it works considering I have about 400 hours on the finals and about 30 on Arc Raiders. And there are genuine benefits to using it. It has allowed Embark to contend with heavy hitters of the industry and keep up, it allows more player expression and accessibility. But there must be a point where the line must be drawn, where the artistic integrity of the product suffers more than it is worth with the cost cutting.

1p13fdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1p13fdn/what_to_eat_in_northern_ireland_when_youre_on_a/,What To Eat in Northern Ireland When You’re On a GLP-1: A Realistic Guide (Not the Instagram Version),"Let’s be honest, half the weight-loss advice online is written by people who’ve never lived in Northern Ireland, never smelt a fry at 8am, never been tempted by a pasty bap, and definitely never done the school run through Belfast while running on fumes and a stinking costa Americano.

So here’s a proper, Northern Ireland realistic guide to food choices when you’re on GLP-1 medications like Wegovy, Ozempic, or any similar treatment.

No Hollywood nonsense. (Holywood?)  
No diet-guru rubbish.  
Just what actually works in our wee corner of the world.



# Why GLP-1s change how you eat in the first place

GLP-1s slow gastric emptying, reduce appetite, and dull cravings, which means:

• smaller portions feel enough  
• greasy foods hit heavier  
• high-carb meals can make you sluggish  
• overeating becomes uncomfortable  
• water suddenly matters more  
• you can go hours without even realising

BUT, you still need proper nutrition, or you’ll feel wiped.



# THE BIG RULE OF GLP-1 EATING

Small meals. Simple meals. Protein first.

That’s it.  
If you do nothing else, do that.



# What to Eat in NI Day-to-Day (Realistically)

Here’s where it actually matters:  
how to eat in a way that suits NI food culture and the effects of GLP-1s.

1. Breakfast Options That Won’t Wreck You

Let’s start by acknowledging that a full fry on Week 1 of Wegovy is a straight-up crime against your insides. Your stomach will put in its notice.

But these work brilliantly:

Light NI Breakfast Ideas

• A soda farl with scrambled eggs (small portion)  
• Wheaten bread with cottage cheese and tomato  
• Greek yoghurt with honey (tiny bit) and berries  
• Poached egg on a small slice of batch loaf  
• Protein shake if you’re not hungry at all

Avoid early days

• fried bacon and sausages (too greasy)  
• hash browns (sit like concrete)  
• big milky coffees if you’re sensitive



# 2. Lunchtime Options That Fit NI Work Life

People here often grab what’s handy, the garage, the shop, the deli counter. That’s fine, but choose the right bits.

Solid NI Lunch Choices

• Chicken & salad wrap (half of it is often enough on GLP-1s)  
• Small portion of stew or soup with a bit of wheaten  
• Tesco meal deal but do:

protein sandwich

fruit

zero sugar drink • Greggs chicken bake (eat half, save the rest) • Leftover roast chicken with a wee bit of mash

Avoid early days

• coronation chicken sandwiches (heavy)  
• anything from the hot counter swimming in grease  
• pasty baps, yes they’re elite but not Week 1 friendly



# 3. Dinner (the danger zone in most NI households)

This is where most NI patients get caught out. Big dinners, big portions, big plates.

GLP-1 friendly NI dinners

• Chicken goujons (oven baked) with salad or veg  
• A small plate of mince and potatoes (comfort food but safe)  
• Slow-cooker chicken curry with rice, tiny portion  
• Fish fingers with peas  
• Roast chicken dinner, but half the spuds

The secret trick

Use side plates instead of dinner plates.  
You’ll naturally eat the correct GLP-1 portion.

Avoid early days

• Chinese takeaway portions (you'll get reflux for 48 hours)  
• anything heavily creamy (carbonara, creamy chicken)  
• big bowls of pasta  
• greasy chippies



What About NI Snacks?

NI is snack country. We know this.  
Here’s what most GLP-1 patients find safe:

Safe Snacks

• Fruit pots  
• A small yoghurt  
• Babybel cheese or cheese cubes  
• A handful of nuts  
• Protein bar (half)  
• Crackerbread with peanut butter  
• A wee Tayto packet if cravings hit

Snacks that often go down badly

• chocolate right after doses  
• crisps late at night  
• pastries  
• buns



# Drinks - The Silent Assassin

Most GLP-1 nausea comes from dehydration, not food.

Golden rule:

2–3 litres of water a day.  
Yes, you’ll pee like a racehorse.  
It’s worth it.

Avoid

• cider (it hits like a brick)  
• heavy Guinness nights  
• sweet coffees  
• milkshakes

Safe-ish

• gin & slimline  
• prosecco  
• light beers  
• clear spirits in small amounts

But honestly?  
Most people don’t fancy drinking much on GLP-1s anyway.



# Eating Out in NI (Because we all do it)

Restaurants that are GLP-1 friendly

• Nando’s (chicken + corn + side salad)  
• Boojum (bowl, not burrito)  
• Wagamama (chicken ramen, share it)  
• Any carvery (small plate portion)

NI takeaway rules

• Pizza: 1–2 slices max  
• Chinese: noodles over chips  
• Indian: chicken tikka over creamy sauces  
• Chippy: kids box portions are perfect



# Cravings: Why NI Patients Notice Different Ones

GLP-1s kill appetite, but cravings stay depending on what you used to rely on:

NI-specific craving patterns we see all the time:

• “I can’t stomach chippy chips anymore”  
• “Tea is grand but coffee wrecks me”  
• “I still want something salty at night”  
• “Bread hits me too heavy but crackers are fine”  
• “Sweets taste too sweet now”

Perfectly normal.  
Your stomach is simply recalibrating.



# The NI GLP-1 Snack Box

We recommend this to half the people who start treatment:

• crackers  
• fruit cups  
• yoghurt  
• sugar-free jelly  
• cheese cubes  
• nuts  
• hydration sachets  
• ready-made soups  
• protein bars (cut in half)

It’s genuinely a lifesaver for the days you’re hungry but can’t face a full meal.



# How Keltoi Works With Patients on Food Issues

Without making it salesy, the Keltoi model does suit GLP-1 eating habits because:

• weekly check-ins catch problems early  
• the doctor adjusts doses if appetite is too low  
• they help you find what foods your body tolerates  
• they monitor energy and nutrition  
• they support you through the “I can’t eat this anymore” phase  
• they keep you stable, not starving

NI patients do best when they feel guided, not left googling in a panic at 11pm.



Eating in NI on GLP-1s is About Balance.

You don’t need to eat like a monk.  
You don’t need avocado toast.  
You don’t need to cut out every comfort food.

You just need:

• smaller meals  
• protein first  
• hydration  
• simple, safe dishes  
• listening to your stomach  
• avoiding grease early on

Because this community is always contributing so much, I thought I would contribute my share too.

I’m an emerging writer who ultimately wants to be a writer/producer. While I know how important the craft is, it’s also important to learn from experienced veterans and hear about their experiences and journey.

Initially, I assumed the top producers were probably too busy for me. So, I softly sent an email to a well respected producer asking if she had any upcoming industry talks or guest lectures at the university I graduated from that were open to alumni (even though I graduated from a different program).

What took me by surprise was that she offered to meet with me for a coffee because of my enthusiasm. (Please be mindful: it’s ok to politely ask, but it's important not to be pushy). It worked out to be perfect timing because I recently experienced a rejection on a passionate project.

So today I met with this producer, and I learned so much from her journey. To start, she told me that in her office, she has a stack of rejection files. I asked her about a very passionate project of hers, the internet says it took her 5 years to get it made, but today I found out it actually took her almost 10 years. She explained that getting it made required patience, learning, drive, and a spirit of precision.

The Takeaway:
Don't believe the myth that everyone at the top is cold or unreachable. There are amazing people out there who want to see you win. Experienced, successful people are often incredibly generous with their time, as long as you approach them with the right heart. But they can't help you if you hide. You have to be brave enough to show up, humble enough to learn, and persistent enough to stay in the room. (A lot of experienced commenters in this community are good examples of this too, they are incredibly generous with their 
advice).

As beginners, it is very easy to get knocked down. But today I learned that you can still get knocked down after years and years of experience, too. It is okay to feel “frozen” for a while, but we have to keep pushing forward if we are really passionate about something.

1p13dyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_karolinaprg/comments/1p13dyf/lack_of_trust_in_a_relationship/,Lack of trust in a relationship,"Looking for advise if it’s possible to rebuild trust in a relationship with my now husband .
Here is the story .

We met 14 months ago . We fell in love fast. He is 50, I am 38.I was always very independent and never wanted to get married . He has never been married either . He asked me to marry him after 3 months and we got married 8 months later . 
The reason I fell for him was he is a good communicator , never left me wondering , always explained everything and I had no doubts about him . I am from a broken family that moved a lot and my mom changed partners a lot , so my trust in men has always been questionable , that is probably why I fell for him hard . He included me in everything - his friends , his family and he talked about me highly to everyone . 
Things started to shift - or should I say his real self started to show 4 months into the relationship. 

Strike 1) I got pregnant and I decided not to keep the baby . He was broken hearted because he wanted a child . While I was deciding whether or not to keep it I had a gut feeling to look into his phone (I know , I’m ashamed ) - found a conversation with his ex where he is pouring his heart to her about how I dont wanna keep the baby . Then it went into sharing memories about the times they had sex in the past . It left me shattered but I forgave him. 

Strike 2) He wanted to bring me flowers but i was too busy that day so we met the next day for dinner and I casually asked where the flowers where . He told me he gave them to his friend (girl) because they would’ve died . He gave them to a friend he talks a lot to and visits her at work a lot just to talk. It didn’t bother me at first because I know he’s very social and has a lot of friends (a lot of girl friends too). On the same day we were in his car and he wanted to go use the restroom but before he went he took his phone and deleted messages from 3 girls ( i saw it as he was doing it ) . That really stabbed me and at that moment inside i wanted to end things . I told him and left and his excuse was he didn’t want me to think something . After i left he showed up at my house begging me to stay and that it really was nothing . I forgave him but never forgot about it .

Strike 3) i left to a different country for almost 3 weeks and when i came back his mom casually mentioned that he had coffee with his ex (the one he was messaging with on strike1) . I never mentioned it to him until a month later when i casually told him i talked to my ex who lives in a different country on the phone that day . He didn’t look happy and i told him he should be happy i tell him about it unlike him . He looked puzzled so i told him he saw his ex and he denied it . After i told him I knew he made an excuse that she wanted to help with her roof and he gave her contacts . Also tried to say she has a boyfriend who lives with her , so no need to worry . 
After this incident i told him that it doesnt bother me that he sees or talks to his exes or girlfriends but what bothers me is when he lies about it . He says his past girlfriend was very jealous and he had to hide things from her to not make her mad and that he would not lie about things like this in the future. 

By then i didn’t trust him eventhough i tried , so i checked his phone again (😩) and noticed regular calls and messages where he sends happy photos of us with one female that i didn’t know . Couple of months later that name popped up as someone i may know on my facebook . I sent him the picture and asked who she was . He told me a whole story that she is their family friend. I trusted him. Few weeks later his coworked mentioned her name as her ex that he was with right before me . 
I got angry and kicked him out . His excuse was he didnt want me to make asumptions and that they are just friends and he’s giving her advice about her boyfriend (and probably vice versa). I didn’t care what he had to say and two hours later he BROUGHT HER into my house . She said he shouldve told me but that he loves me so much he doesnt wanna do anything to give me doubts and to loose me . 
I caved in again . 

Strike 4)My trust in him is so broken I checked his phone again after i wanted to take a few days to settle my thoughts . 
When I saw him after two days I went into his phone and first thing I see is a conversation with his past coworker where she is telling him about her relationship issues and he reassures her that she’s a great woman and on top of everything she fucks good . Then he starts reminiscing on the time they fucked in the bathtub together and wants to go into details but she stopped him . After that he tried to call her the next few days but she didnt allow it . I kept it in for a month and I was boiling . When I finally exploded he said they were FWB 6 years ago . I wonder what would have happened if she did take his calls and continued ….

Now my thing is I am married to him - shortly - I do wanna trust him but it is impossible . I didn’t wanna end up like my mom who’s marriages never worked out . Now I am almost 40 - at my first marriage and i am always stressed thinking. I am happy when we are together but always thinking when he’s away for few hours because  i always wonder …
This is totally unhealthy . I crossed my boundaries by checking his phone and I am not his mom to keep checking to make sure he’s acting like a husband I don’t have to be ashamed of . 

What are your thoughts ? Am I overreacting ?

Would you think these were red flags too?,"F31/M30. Met through hinge (after messaging only a few hours.) The banter was good, we quickly moved to voice messages and it seemed like we got along. The next day he asked me to a coffee date. So far, so good. He was well dressed and groomed. He acted like a gentleman. The date ended up lasting hours because after coffee we walked around town, got lunch, then got a couple cocktails. Conversations flowed, but there were some glaring things that bothered me.

1. I arrived on time, and he was outside the coffee shop on the phone. He recognized me and gave me a ""hold on"" finger, as he finished up the call, I awkwardly stood there. The context of the conversation was him telling someone to go back to sleep and to feel better. He didn't explain who it was or apologize when he was off the phone. My first instinct was is it's another girl.
2. It took us a while to get a good conversation going. He presented as stern and cold at first. Almost bored seeming. I figured he's just shy. Eventually I brought him out of his shell, and he seemed to loosen up.
3. He mentioned he doesn't have a lot of close friends because he's quick to cut people off, saying he's a hot head, but better at controlling his anger now.
4. Kept giving hints about how ""wealthy"" he is. That he has maids, paid for his car in cash. I later found out he lives with his parents, he said he just moved back in with them to save money.
5. He was staring at me over lunch and I said ""yes?"" And he said ""just taking in the view,"" and looked me up in down with a smirk. Made me feel uncomfortable.
6. At end of date we kissed (it felt too intense for a first date kiss,) and then he kissed me on the forehead (felt too intimate to me.)

From here, he did everything right, expressed he had fun on date and set a dinner date for a few days from there. He picked a nice restaurant, so I agreed. Before second date i was still feeling unsure, and that kiss grossed me out, so I texted him I would like to take things really slow for this next date. On the 2nd date he didn't try anything, so I was glad he followed my lead. But after another 2 weeks of texting I cut things off in a very polite way saying im actually not ready to date/want to focus on myself, but it took him weeks to stop texting me after that, (even though I left his messages unanswered.)

I'm in my head, wondering if I was too harsh. Overall, the date was fun. I'm not going to reach out to this guy or anything. Just want some outside perspective if my gut was right or if I overreacted.",2,1763545612.0,dating_advice,7,0.75,False

You know that sinking feeling. Someone turns to you and says, “So, tell me about yourself.” Your mind races. Do you give your job title? Your life story. A funny joke.

Most people fail this test, “introduce yourself in 10 seconds”. They either ramble for five minutes or shrink themselves with phrases like “I’m just a…” or “I sort of do…”.

Last week, a senior manager fumbled his introduction at a $2M pitch meeting. He lost the room in 10 seconds. Here’s what he should have said instead…” Or: “I’ve watched brilliant professionals destroy their credibility with three words: ‘I’m just a…’

But in our connected world, your introduction is your most powerful personal branding tool. It is not just what you say. it is the first signal of your confidence, clarity, and value.

A powerful introduction is not about boasting. It is about connecting. It is about making the other person think, “I need to know more about this person.”

Through my courses on the platform [**www.whatisscrum.org**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/), I’ve helped over 140,000 students master these principles., I have refined a simple, universal formula. **Let me show you how it works, using my own career as a real-world example.**

[Think You Can’t Be a Scrum Master? Watch This FIRST!](https://youtu.be/QH-Pu4hKHkY?si=NCmTmQ4Xeu6nrIpJ)

# The 3 Fatal Mistakes Why Most Introductions Fail

1. **Too Much Information** – People dump their entire resume
2. **No Clear Value** – They describe what they do, not what problems they solve
3. **No Human Connection** – They forget to show why it matters

The 3-part formula fixes all three issues…

# The Universal 3-Part Formula for a Powerful Introduction

Forget memorizing a rigid script. You only need to remember three parts. The magic is in how you adapt them.

1. **Who You Are:** Your name and your professional anchor. (1 sentence)
2. **What You Do:** The specific problem you solve or value you create. (1 sentence)
3. **Why It Matters:** Your hook. the higher purpose or impact. (1 sentence)

This framework forces clarity and cuts the fluff. Let us see it in action with my profile.

**My Core 3-Part Introduction (The Template):**

* **Who I Am:** “I’m Dejan. I help teams cut their project delivery time in half using Scrum.”
* **What I Do:** “I’ve trained over 140,000 professionals who’ve gone on to land Scrum Master roles at companies like Uber and Netflix.”
* **Why It Matters:** “Why? Because when teams work well together, they can do amazing things.”

This is my skeleton. Now, let us dress it for different occasions. Watch how the same core information is twisted to achieve different goals.

# How to Adapt Your Intro in 5 Real-Life Scenarios?

# 1. The Formal Business Meeting

* **Context:** Meeting with potential enterprise clients for my “Agile & Scrum for Business” service.
* **Goal:** Establish authority and show strategic value.
* **My Introduction:** “I’m Dejan. I’ve spent over ten years helping companies switch to better ways of working. As a top IT leader, I helped one organization get 30% more work done. I’m here to see how we can use that same approach to help your team work faster and better.”
* **Why it Works:** It leads with a high-level role (CIO) and a concrete, impressive result (30% efficiency gain). It is direct, professional, and immediately frames me as a strategic partner, not just a trainer.

# 2. The Business Conference or Networking Event

* **Context:** A tech or leadership conference.
* **Goal:** Be approachable, memorable, and spark a connection.
* **My Introduction:** “Hi, I’m Dejan. I have a site called [**WhatIsScrum.org**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/) where I help teams fix chaotic projects using a method called Scrum. I’ve taught thousands of people, and I love meeting other leaders who want to build great teams. What are you working on?”
* **Why it Works:** It starts with a friendly, simple opener. It clearly states who I help and what problem I solve (“chaotic projects”). It ends with an open-ended question that turns a monologue into a dialogue.

# 3. Casual Settings (Networking Events & Social Mixers)

* **Context:** Business conferences, after-work meetups, or social gatherings where work naturally comes up.
* **Goal:** Be approachable and memorable without being “salesy.”
* **My Introduction:** “Hi, I’m Dejan. I run [WhatIsScrum.org](http://WhatIsScrum.org), where I help teams escape meeting hell and actually ship products people love. The best part? I’ve taught over 140,000 people, and I still get messages from students who say, ‘Your course changed my career.’ That never gets old. But enough about me—what brings you here tonight?”
* **Why it Works:** It balances professionalism with personality. “Meeting hell” is relatable and slightly humorous, which works in casual settings. The social proof (140,000 students) establishes credibility without feeling like a pitch. Ending with a question immediately shifts focus to the other person, making you likable rather than self-promotional.

# 4. The Job Interview

* **Context:** First or second-round interview for a Scrum Master, Agile Coach, or leadership role.
* **Goal:** Differentiate yourself from other candidates and demonstrate strategic thinking.
* **My Introduction:** “I’m Dejan, and over the past two decades, I’ve specialized in transforming chaotic teams into high-performing units. As CIO at the Tax Administration, I led a digital transformation that delivered 30% efficiency gains and 20% cost reduction. But my real passion is teaching. I’ve trained 140,000+ professionals globally through my courses, which gives me a unique perspective: I understand both the leadership and the practitioner side of Agile. I’m here because \[Company Name if I know at that moment\]’s mission to \[specific company goal if I am aware of in that moment\] aligns perfectly with how I approach transformation and changing how people think about work.”
* **Why it Works:** It follows the classic interview structure: past achievements (with metrics), present expertise (teaching scale), and future fit (why this company). The numbers are concrete and impressive. The acknowledgment of the company’s mission shows you’ve done your homework. This is “I’m uniquely qualified for YOU.”

# 5. LinkedIn Profile or Written Bio

* **Context:** Your LinkedIn “About” section, conference bio, or speaker introduction.
* **Goal:** Make people want to connect, follow, or book you.
* **My Introduction:** “I help teams stop wasting time and start delivering results. As CIO, I lead IT strategy for an organization serving millions of citizens. I’ve driven transformations that achieved 30% efficiency improvements and 20% cost reductions. That’s proof that Agile isn’t just a theory. But my real mission extends beyond my day job. Through [**WhatIsScrum.org**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/), I’ve taught 140,000+ students on how to master Scrum and Agile. From career changers landing their first Scrum Master role to seasoned leaders transforming their organizations, I’m obsessed with making complex frameworks simple and actionable. Want to work smarter, not harder? Let’s connect.”
* **Why it Works:** Written bios need a different rhythm than spoken introductions. This version uses short, punchy paragraphs for scalability. It leads with a benefit statement, follows with credibility (CIO role + metrics), then shows scale and impact (140,000 students). The closing question is a micro-call-to-action that invites engagement. Notice: no jargon, no humble-bragging, just clear value.

# 6. With Friends of Friends or Family

* **Context:** A BBQ or family gathering.
* **Goal:** Be relatable and connect on a personal level.
* **My Introduction:** “You know me! Lately, I’ve been busy helping people learn a new way to work so they can find jobs they really love. The best part is hearing from them how it’s changed their lives.”
* **Why it Works:** It is personal and passionate. It focuses on the human impact of my work (“transformed their professional lives”) rather than the mechanics, which is what friends and family care about most.

# The Pro Tip: Master the Pivot

The most powerful introductions are a two-way street. After you have delivered your clear, confident introduction, the next step is crucial. pivot the conversation back to the other person.

This shows you are interested in them and transforms a presentation into a conversation. Use a simple transition:

* “But that is enough about me. I would love to hear what brings you here today.”
* “So, that is what I am focused on. What is exciting in your world right now?”
* “But I am really curious about your perspective. What has your experience with that been?”

This single habit will make you not only confident but also incredibly likable.

# The Missing Piece of Your Job Search Strategy

This post is **Lesson #4** in my series on breaking into your first Scrum Master role. Here’s why I’m teaching you this now:  
In the previous lessons, I showed you:

1. [**The Real Path to Your First Scrum Master Role**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/the-real-path-to-your-first-scrum-master-role/) – The honest roadmap that actually works
2. [**Making Yourself Irresistible to Recruiters (Even Without Experience)**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/making-yourself-irresistible-to-recruiters-even-without-experience/) – How to position yourself when you’re “unqualified”
3. [**Your 90-Day Action Plan to Land Your First Scrum Master Role**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/your-90-day-action-plan-to-land-your-first-scrum-master-role/) – The exact steps to take each week

But here’s what I’ve learned coaching thousands of career changers: You can have the perfect resume, the right certifications, and a solid action plan… and still lose the opportunity in the first 30 seconds of a networking call or interview.

Why? Because you haven’t mastered your introduction. So let me help you introduce yourself in 10 seconds.

Your introduction is the bridge between your preparation and your opportunity. It’s where all that hard work from Lessons 1-3 either comes together or falls apart.

Think about it:

* That LinkedIn message to a hiring manager? It starts with your introduction.
* That networking coffee chat with a Scrum Master? You’ve got 10 seconds to make them want to mentor you.
* That “Tell me about yourself” question in your first interview? This is your moment.

**The career changers who land roles aren’t always the most qualified. They’re the ones who can articulate their value with confidence and clarity.**

# Your Homework: Build Your Own Introduction Engine

1. **Extract Your Core Three:** Look at your own CV. What is your anchor role? What is the key problem you solve? What is your deeper mission? Write your core 3.part script.
2. **Practice Two Versions Aloud:** Start with a Formal and a Networking version. Say them out loud until they feel natural, not recited.
3. **Drop the Weak Language:** Commit to a week without “just,” “only,” “sort of,” or “I guess.” You will be amazed at the shift in your presence.

Your ability to introduce yourself with confidence is the key that unlocks doors you did not even know were there. It sets the tone for every relationship and opportunity that follows.

**Now, go make those 10 seconds count.**

# One Last Thing

I’ve trained over 140,000 students, and here’s what separates those who land roles from those who stay stuck: **execution**.

Reading this post won’t change anything. **Doing the work this week will**.

So here’s my challenge: Write your 3-part introduction in the comments below. I’ll personally review the first 20 and give you specific feedback on how to make it stronger.  
And if you want to experience my teaching style before committing to the full journey? Try my [**Scrum Career Compass**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/) course. It’s the same approach, practical, no-nonsense, and designed to get you results.

Your first Scrum Master role is waiting. Let’s make sure you’re ready when opportunity knocks.

1p139u6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p139u6,"Replaced by Bastard Sister, Claimed by Billionaire Hockey Prince—Revenge Served Cold","My father's old friend entrusted his daughter Elara Whitaker to our family before he passed away.


Elara was everything I wasn't—bubbly, outgoing.


Me, Josephine Caldwell? I was the quiet one, living for grades and test scores.


Dad treated her like his own daughter. My brothers, Connor and Julian, drove her around the city to every trendy hotspot for Instagram-worthy photos and gave her the latest digital products.


Even Sebastian Vale, my boyfriend—the school's golden boy—only complained she was ""too clingy"" or ""always acting like a princess.""


Yet during every club meeting, I noticed his gaze drifting toward her.


And then came the school's anniversary gala.


He ditched our duet—the one we'd been rehearsing for weeks—and replaced it with some fancy four-hand piano piece with her.


I stared down at the program in my hands, my name crossed out in thick black ink.


Then I said. ""We're done.""


Sebastian's hand froze mid-air, staring at me in shock. Before he could get a word out, Elara—standing right behind him—immediately teared up.


She was wearing a white chiffon dress, the exact same style as the performance outfit I'd prepared.


""Josephine, please don't blame Sebastian. It's my fault... I just really wanted to perform at the gala, and he felt bad for me, so he—""


I didn't even look at her. My eyes stayed locked on Sebastian.


""I said, we're done.""


His jaw tightened, irritation flashing across his face.


""Josephine, seriously? You're gonna blow up over one damn song?""


""Elara just got here. It's her first school event. I'm her senior—what's the big deal?""


""You're already boring as hell most of the time. When the hell did you get so petty?""


I stared at him for a second longer, then turned and walked off the stage.


The auditorium buzzed with noise. No one noticed the little drama unfolding in the corner.


I tossed the scratched-out program into the trash and left the building, pulling out my phone to send him one last text.


\[I'm not asking. I'm telling you. We're done.\]


When I got home, the living room was lit up.


Dad, Connor, Julian, and Elara were all gathered around the TV, watching the live stream of the gala. On screen? Sebastian and Elara, playing their stupid piano duet.


The music floated through the room. They looked perfect together.


""Oh my God, Elara, you're so talented! That was amazing!"" Connor clapped like she'd just won a Grammy.


""Yeah, way better than some people who just bury themselves in textbooks all day,"" Julian muttered, shooting me a pointed look.


Dad's eyes shifted from the screen to me, cold and assessing.


""Why didn't you come back with Sebastian?""


I kicked off my shoes, my voice flat.


""We broke up.""


The room went dead silent.


Elara was the first to react, jumping up with tears streaming down her face as she rushed over to me.


""Josephine, I'm so sorry! This is all my fault! Please don't break up with Sebastian—I'll go explain everything to him right now!""


Dad's face darkened. He slammed his cane against the floor.


""This is ridiculous! Josephine, you're not a child anymore. Stop being dramatic!""


""Elara is your sister. Sebastian was just being nice to her. And instead of being mature about it, you throw a tantrum and break up with him? Where the hell are your manners?""


I looked up at him, my voice steady.


""My manners? Mom taught me those before she died. And the first thing she taught me was to never let anyone make me feel small.""


I turned and headed upstairs, pulling out my suitcase.


A few minutes later, Connor appeared in my doorway, leaning against the frame with his arms crossed.


""What's this, Josephine? You running away from home now? You think you're five years old?""


I folded a few shirts and packed them without looking at him.


""Just go downstairs, apologize to Dad, and we'll forget this whole thing happened.""


""Elara's a guest. She's Dad's old friend's daughter. We're supposed to treat her well. Why can't you just deal with it?""


""I'm not the problem.""


""You guys are.""


Connor's expression hardened.


I grabbed my suitcase and walked past him.


Downstairs, Julian blocked my path.


""Josephine, what the hell is wrong with you? You really gonna make this ugly?""


I glanced at him, then at Dad sitting on the couch with a scowl on his face, and Elara beside him, quietly crying.


""I'm tired. I'm done pretending to be the understanding, selfless, perfect daughter and sister.""


""So yeah. Leave me the hell alone.""


I shoved past Julian and opened the front door.


Behind me, Dad's voice exploded.


""If you walk out that door, don't you dare come back!""


I didn't stop. I disappeared into the night.


They all thought I was just throwing a fit.


That I'd come crawling back in a few days—broke, homeless, desperate.


Too bad for them.


They were dead wrong.


Chapter 2


I drove to a penthouse apartment in one of the New York's most exclusive neighborhoods.


Fingerprint unlock. Door swung open.


This place was my eighteenth birthday gift from Mom.


She'd told me back then. ""Josephine, I want you to always have options. Always have a way out.""


This apartment? Nobody knew about it except her and me.


I dropped my bags, poured myself a glass of water, and stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, staring out at the glittering city skyline.


My phone kept buzzing in my pocket.


I pulled it out and glanced at the screen. Missed calls from Dad. From my brothers. And over thirty from Sebastian.


I switched it to airplane mode. I was done dealing with their bullshit.


The next morning, I went to campus and filed for off-campus housing.


My advisor looked surprised but approved it without much fuss.


The second I stepped out of the office, I ran straight into Sebastian.


He had dark circles under his eyes, like he hadn't slept all night. He was still wearing the same wrinkled suit from yesterday's performance.


The moment he saw me, he rushed over and grabbed my wrist.


""Josephine, why the hell didn't you answer my calls? Do you have any idea how worried I was? I looked for you all night!""


His voice was loud, laced with barely-contained anger. Students in the hallway turned to stare.


I tried to pull my arm away, but he only tightened his grip.


""What the hell is your problem? There's nothing going on between me and Elara! I just felt bad for her—she's new, she doesn't have any friends, she looked so lonely.""


""I already yelled at her, okay? She knows she messed up. Just come back with me so we can talk this out. Don't break up with me, please.""


I looked at him and almost laughed.


""Sebastian, you really think Elara's the problem here?""


He froze.


""Isn't she?""


""No. The problem is that when it came down to me or her, you picked her.""


""You handed over the performance I spent two months preparing for—just gave it to her like it was nothing.""


""And when I needed you to have my back, you called me boring and petty instead.""


""So yeah. We're done.""


Sebastian looked lost, like he wanted to say something but had no idea what.


""Josephine... I—""


""Let go.""


A cold, sharp voice cut through the tension. Both of us turned.


Alexander Fairchild.


The school's Hockey Hottie. Student council president. Old money. Untouchable.


He was half a head taller than Sebastian, his expression unreadable as his eyes flicked down to where Sebastian's hand was still clamped around my wrist.


Sebastian clearly recognized him. His face darkened, but he didn't let go.


""This is between me and my girlfriend. Stay out of it.""


Alexander didn't respond right away. His gaze shifted to me for just a second—calm, steady, like he could see right through the walls I'd put up.


Then he turned back to Sebastian, his expression dropping several degrees, dripping with disdain.


He pulled out his phone and snapped a photo of us.


Then he held it up, tilting his head with mock interest.


""Huh. Fresh content for the campus creep forum. A guy who thinks grabbing women solves relationship problems? Yeah, I'm sure the internet's gonna love this.""


Sebastian's face went red. He shot me one last glare before finally letting go.


""You're gonna regret this, Josephine.""


He stormed off.


I rubbed my wrist where his fingers had left red marks and muttered a quiet ""thanks"" to Alexander.


He pocketed his phone, his eyes lingering on my face for a beat longer than necessary.


""Your duet partner got swapped out pretty last-minute yesterday.""


I nodded. ""Yeah. Didn't see that one coming.""


He didn't press further. Just said, ""Living off-campus alone? Be careful.""


Then he turned and walked away, his tall frame disappearing down the hallway.


I stared after him, something unfamiliar stirring in my chest.


We weren't close. We'd only crossed paths a few times during project meetings. And yet, he kept showing up when I needed someone.


This guy—who seemed so far above everyone else—suddenly didn't feel so unreachable anymore.


Chapter 3


I had no classes that afternoon, so I headed to a bank downtown.


I had two cards under my name.


One was the supplementary card Dad gave me for monthly allowances.


The other? Mom's.


The second I walked into the VIP lounge, my phone rang. The bank manager.


""Miss Caldwell, your father just called to freeze your supplementary card ending in 8888.""


I wasn't surprised.


Classic Dad move. Cut off my money, force me to come crawling back.


""Got it.""


""And the other card?""


The manager's tone shifted, more respectful now. ""Miss Caldwell, the Black Card your mother left you has the highest level of clearance. No one but you can access it. Current balance is...""


He rattled off a number so long I almost laughed.


Enough to keep me comfortable for the rest of my life.


""Thanks.""


I hung up and transferred a hefty chunk from the Black Card into my everyday savings account.


As I left the bank, my phone buzzed. Text from Julian.


\[Dad froze your card. When you're broke and starving, come home and apologize. Stop being a brat.\]


Annoying.


That evening, Elara messaged me on Instagram.


\[Josephine, please don't be mad at Dad and your brothers anymore. They're just worried about you. Where are you right now? I can have Sebastian pick you up and bring you home, okay?\]


Attached was a photo.


Our living room. The four of them—Dad, Connor, Julian, and Elara—sitting around the coffee table, laughing, eating fruit. Elara was leaning against Dad's side, grinning like she'd just won the lottery.


On the table sat an opened gift box. Inside? The latest gaming console.


The one Connor had promised to buy me last week.


Now it was hers.


I smirked and typed back:


\[Oh wow, thanks SO much!\]


Next day, I went to class like nothing happened.


But the second I walked into the classroom, I knew something was off.


Everyone was staring at me.


My desk mate—a girl I usually got along with pretty well—leaned over hesitantly.


""Josephine... have you seen the forum post?""


I pulled out my phone and opened the campus forum.


A pinned thread sat at the top, glowing red.


\[MAJOR TEA! Josephine breaks up with Sebastian out of jealousy over him helping new transfer student, then MOVES OUT in the middle of the night!\]


The post painted a vivid picture of what happened at the gala.


I was the bitch—jealous, petty, dramatic.


Elara was the innocent victim—sweet, helpless, pitiable.


And Sebastian? The noble hero sacrificing his relationship to help a friend's daughter.


There were photos attached.


One of Elara crying backstage, looking devastated.


One of Sebastian on his phone, looking frantic.


And one of me walking away, my back turned to the camera.


The angle made me look cold and heartless.


The comments were already in the hundreds.


\[I always knew Josephine was mean. Guess this proves it.\]


\[Poor Sebastian. What a nightmare girlfriend.\]


\[Feel so bad for Elara. She just got here and she's already getting bullied.\]


\[Wait, isn't she staying at Josephine's house? Yikes. She's gonna get it now.\]


My desk mate whispered, ""Josephine, shouldn't you say something? You can't just let them trash you like this.""


My nails dug into my palms. For a split second, I wanted to find whoever posted this and rip them apart.


But the anger faded into something hollow and numb.


I put my phone away, my voice flat.


""There's nothing to explain.""


The truth didn't matter.


People only believed what they wanted to believe.


And whoever posted this? I didn't need to guess.


Who else would have those perfectly timed photos?


Only Elara.

1p137o0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p137o0,"Honey, That 'Poor Employee' You Stole $300K From? IS YOUR BILLIONAIRE BOSS!","When the executives started handing out project bonuses on stage, my heart was pounding.


This was MY victory. A week of hell, $300,000 in prize money, and a promotion to Project Manager. All mine.


""Now, let's welcome Charlotte Williams to the stage to receive the project bonus. Thanks to her outstanding work, the company is promoting her to Project Manager.""


The room went dead silent.


Hundreds of eyes turned toward me—pity, sympathy, mockery—all of it crashing down on me at once, making my skin crawl.


Because they ALL knew who actually did the damn project. But they also knew the truth: nobodies like me? We get screwed. That's just how it works.


Benjamin and I weren't public. No one knew we were together.


I bit down hard, trying to keep my rage in check.


""I did this project. ALONE. There's a security camera right above my desk that recorded me working my ass off for a WEEK. And her? She sat around drinking coffee and playing games on her phone. Now she's taking MY work? MY $300,000?""


The executives barely looked at me. One of them actually rolled his eyes.


Of course. Charlotte was his precious niece. This was straight-up theft, and everyone was just... fine with it.


""YOUR project? Oh, honey. You're hilarious. A nobody like you handling a project this big? If you were that good, you'd be sitting in MY seat. Right, everyone?""


The room burst into laughter.


They were laughing AT me. Calling me stupid. Calling me worthless.


My fists clenched so tight my nails cut into my palms.


Charlotte stood up, reached into her pocket, and pulled out three hundred-dollar bills.


Then she threw them at my face.


""Emily Carter, if you're gonna try to steal credit, at least make it believable. Here. Take your sad little team out for dinner. On me.""


She stepped closer, her voice dripping with poison.


""Don't even THINK about fighting me. I'll spell it out for you—I OWN this company. Every executive here? Family. This place belongs to the Williams family. If I say I did the project, then I DID IT. End of story.""


She raised her hand and patted my cheek like I was a dog.


Swallow it. Smile. Know your place.


I slapped her hand away and glared at the executives who were all too happy to back her up.


""You ALL know I did this project. You're just letting her steal it because she's family. Fine. If you won't help me, I'll find someone who WILL.""


Charlotte's smirk grew wider. Her voice turned even more vicious.


""You? A NOBODY? Who the hell in this company would ever back YOU? You're NOTHING.""


Before she could keep going, one of her little minions jumped in.


""Exactly! You're just a pathetic employee. Who do you think you are?""


""Keep talking, and we'll make sure you NEVER work anywhere again.""


She leaned in so close I could feel her spit hitting my face as she laughed.


""That's what trash like you deserves. Spit. Because that's all you're worth.""


I kicked her square in the chest. She stumbled backward, gasping.


Then I calmly pulled out a tissue, wiped the spit off my face, and dropped it at her feet.


""You think you own this company? Newsflash—there are people WAY above your pathetic little family. And I WILL find someone who'll give me justice.""


Chapter 2


The second Charlotte heard me say I was going to find someone higher up to get justice, her smug grin vanished.


Just as I turned to leave, she shot a look at one of her lackeys. He stuck his foot out and tripped me.


The room exploded into laughter again.


""HAHAHA! What an idiot! You think you can run and tattle? Who the hell are you gonna tell?""


""You say ONE word, and I'll make sure you NEVER find work again. You'll be begging for scraps on the street, sleeping under a bridge like the trash you are.""


I clenched my jaw and got back on my feet.


If it weren't for Benjamin, I wouldn't even BE at this branch. I wouldn't have to put up with this humiliation.


""You think the Williams family runs this city? You're NOTHING. What makes you think you have the power to blacklist me from the entire industry? To make me homeless?""


The second those words left my mouth, my coworkers looked at me like I'd just signed my own death warrant.


""Does she seriously not know the Williams and Davis families control EVERYTHING in this city? Cross them, and you're done for.""


""If I were her, I'd just swallow my pride and move on. There's no winning this.""


Charlotte heard every word. And she loved it.


""Hear that, trash? You think you can report ME? How many lives do you have to throw away?""


I didn't flinch. If anything, I found her pathetic.


""This is a civilized society. Not some lawless hellhole where you can just threaten people. Use your brain for once.""


""You're so scared of me reporting you because you KNOW the truth. Once this gets investigated, everyone will find out I did the project. And all the credit went to a lazy, useless fraud like you.""


""I'll kill you, you bitch!""


I'd hit a nerve. Charlotte lunged at me, fist raised.


But this time, I was ready. I'd learned how to deal with snakes like her.


I dodged her punch easily and headed straight for the door.


""STOP HER!"" Charlotte screamed.


I bolted toward Benjamin Davis's office. He was the Vice President of the branch, overseeing all major operations.


""Benjamin, I worked my ass off on this project. Charlotte stole it. She claimed she did everything herself and took all the credit and all the money. This isn't fair. Not to me, not to any of us.""


Charlotte burst into the room right behind me, aiming a kick at my back.


I dodged again.


""Touch me one more time, and I'm calling the cops for assault.""


""Benjamin, did you SEE that? She's completely lost it. She's trying to attack me.""


Benjamin didn't say a word.


I turned to look at him, confused.


His eyes were ice-cold.


We were engaged. An arranged marriage between our families. My father sent me here to ""get to know him better.""


To hide my background—and to observe Benjamin's character—I took a low-level position at the branch.


He stood up and walked toward Charlotte.


For a split second, I thought he was going to back me up.


Instead, he reached out and gently smoothed down her messy hair.


His cold gaze melted into something soft. Tender.


That coldness? It was all for me.


My heart sank like a stone.


Chapter 3


""Benjamin, I'm your fiancée. Remember?""


The second those words left my mouth, everyone in the room—except Charlotte—froze in shock.


""WHAT? Emily Carter is Vice President Davis's fiancée?""


""No way. That's impossible. He's Benjamin Davis—powerful, wealthy, gorgeous. How could a nobody like her ever be engaged to HIM?""


""I don't buy it. She's not even worthy of being Charlotte's assistant. Look at him—he's comforting Charlotte right now. So gentle, so caring. If Emily really WAS his fiancée, why would he treat Charlotte like that and ignore Emily completely?""


The whispers reached Benjamin's ears. He turned to look at me.


""My assistant already filled me in on what happened.""


""And?""


""And the project was done by Charlotte. You're just a lazy fraud trying to steal credit.""


The room erupted.


""See? I KNEW it!""


""So Charlotte really DID do the project. Even Vice President Davis—who's always fair—says so.""


""That means Emily's been LYING this whole time. She probably just sat around pretending to work, then tried to claim she did everything herself. What a joke.""


""She's not his fiancée. She's delusional. A toad trying to eat swan meat.""


""Ugh, pathetic. She should take a good look in the mirror.""


Charlotte was glowing. Benjamin backed her up, and now everyone was turning on me.


My rage was boiling over. But at the same time, I finally understood what it meant to be powerless.


No matter where you work, if you don't have connections, there will ALWAYS be people ready to sabotage you. To steal your work. To crush you.


""Benjamin, our engagement was YOUR family's idea. The Davis family proposed it to the Carters. If you have a problem with me, just break it off.""


Benjamin's face twisted with disgust.


""Bullshit. The Davis family would NEVER propose a marriage alliance to some insignificant family like yours. And you? You're a nobody. My father wants me to marry you? Over my dead body. Give it up.""


""Fine. If that's how you feel, let's drop the engagement talk and get back to business.""


""Do you people think you're above the law? That you can just steal whatever you want and threaten whoever you want?""


""Don't you DARE accuse us of that. We never said anything like that.""

I’m not sure whether the grind is too fine or if it’s simply because it’s a dark roast, but the coffee tastes extremely bitter.

2. I followed the common brewing steps recommended on various subreddits for making good moka-pot coffee, but I still have one slightly silly question. As a lifelong instant-coffee drinker, I assumed that all the coffee grounds I added would be fully “used up.” The issue is that even after carefully measuring the grounds for a single cup—keeping the water-to-coffee ratio as suggested—when I fill the funnel, brew the coffee, and then open the moka pot to clean it, almost 80% of the grounds are still sitting in the funnel.

This makes me wonder:

Is that coffee wasted?

Are the grounds not being extracted properly?

That day, I learned my husband had built a cozy little home with her in Centennial Hills.
\*\*\*
I slid the divorce papers across the table to Augustine, calm and collected as ever.
""Sign them.""
Augustine arched an eyebrow, his expression dripping with amusement.
Tucked beneath the agreement was a newspaper, sensationalized to the hilt, detailing how Augustine's lover, Cecilia Webster, had stolen the spotlight at the funeral, leaving his real wife humiliated and sidelined.
""Kassandra, must you play these childish games again?"" he asked casually.
""For eight years, you've dangled divorce over my head like a threat—must be at least a hundred times by now. Haven't you gotten tired of this routine?""
Then he fished a black card out of his pocket and flicked it onto the table.
""If that's not enough, just hit up Brad—he'll wire you more. I've been swamped with work lately, but you can call me if you need anything.""
I didn't take the card. I simply cast a cool glance at Cecilia in his arms.
All the women Augustine had paraded around these years looked just like her.
I knew exactly why Augustine never married Cecilia after she came back.
After all, the wife of the underground king wasn't meant for the one he loved—it was for the one who fit the role, the strategic choice.
""You planning to keep her as your side piece forever?""
I nudged the divorce papers forward again.
Cecilia pouted in annoyance, clearly stung by the ""side piece"" label. She cooed in that saccharine voice of hers, ""Ms. Lambert, love's between two people. The one who's not loved is the real side piece.""
Augustine chuckled lightly, saying nothing to contradict her.
He stroked her cheek affectionately, then turned to me. ""We'll go to the church tomorrow morning. Don't be late.""
I didn't look away until his figure faded.
Every week, Augustine dragged me to church, saying it would cleanse us of our sins.
His mother, Shelly Clayton, often hinted that my barren womb was proof of my sin.
And Augustine? He saw my intolerance for his mistresses as the sin of jealousy.
Stepping into the church, I closed my eyes and began to pray.
When Augustine arrived, an inexplicable wave of panic gripped my heart.
""Kassandra,"" he called out.
My pulse quickened, a knot tightening in my chest.
""A sorcerer told me Cecilia's in for some bad luck this year. The only way to ward it off is to soak her feet in water mixed with your father's ashes.""
I shot to my feet, staring into his cold, impassive eyes in utter shock—then burst into a hollow laugh.
""Augustine, eight years ago, I consulted a fortune teller about us. I lied and said we were a perfect match, but the truth? He told me you will ruin my life, and we will never have a baby.
""If you so much as touch my father's grave, I'll smash your father's coffin to splinters.""
Over the years, I'd cried and raged over his endless affairs.
I'd learned the hard way: in this cutthroat jungle, no man respected a woman who endured everything without fighting back.
His face darkened in an instant.
""Do it!"" he ordered, his voice stern, brooking no dissent.
""Augustine!""
His henchmen pinned me down with iron grips, while the others desecrated my father's grave right before my eyes.
""Kassandra, this is for your father's own good. Ashes are useless. Helping Cecilia out? It's an honor for him.""
""Get the hell off me!""
Fueled by the absurdity of it all, I lashed out, shoving his goons aside and snatching the urn back.
Then, a brutal blow cracked against the back of my head.
Warm blood trickled down my forehead, blurring my vision.
I couldn't hold onto the urn anymore. Soon, someone ripped it from my arms.
In agony, I raised my head and, under the harsh sun, saw Augustine's cold face.
""Deliver it to the sorcerer,"" he said.
I forced a bitter smile and then blacked out.
Chapter 2
When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.
My loyal aide filled me in: Augustine had spent the last few days in Centennial Hills with Cecilia.
He had used my father's ashes for some twisted black magic ritual, trying to bind my dad's spirit, forcing his ghost to serve Cecilia like some obedient phantom.
I yanked out the IV needle, gathered a squad of men I'd trained, and went straight there.
Cecilia was lounging on the sofa, sipping coffee, her face draining of color when she saw me burst through the door.
I scanned the opulent villa and found a brand-new altar in the corner.
There, staring back at me, was my father's portrait.
The sight ignited an inferno of rage inside me, flames licking at my veins.
""Kassandra, you're not welcome here! If you try anything, I'll make sure Augustine...""
Before she could finish her threat, I lunged, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking her toward the altar.
""Looks like you still don't get it.
""I'm Augustine's real wife. Every damn penny from his arms empire? Half of it's mine! If I want you out of here, you won't last an hour.""
I stamped on her wrist with my combat boot, grinding down hard.
Cecilia let out a piercing shriek, agony ripping through her.
""You... you old hag! Augustine will never let you get away with this!""
I sneered, tightening my grip on her hair and slamming her face into the floor.
""You think you can stay young forever? In this world, youth is the cheapest commodity.
""You wanted my dad's ashes to break your curse? Foot-soaking's not enough. Here—drink every last drop of that filthy water!""
I signaled my men to hold her down, then poured the basin of ash-tainted water straight down her throat.
For every spill, I slapped her hard across the face.
By the time I let go, her cheeks were swollen, her lips bloodied.
Suddenly, urgent footsteps echoed behind us.
Augustine arrived, radiating an arctic chill, his private army following close behind, all weapons drawn and ready.
""Kassandra, you've crossed the line.""
His voice was a frozen blade as he bent down and scooped up the limp woman in his arms.
I met his glare head-on. ""Mr. Clayton, compared to what you've done, this is nothing.""
His eyes blazed with arctic rage.
""Throw her into the snake pit out back. No one pulls her out without my order.""
It was the venomous viper den he'd excavated just to indulge Cecilia's twisted whims.
""You wanted to watch an execution, right? Today, you'll get your fill,"" he murmured tenderly to the woman in his embrace.
Two burly guards dragged me roughly toward the rear of the property.
In the chilling depths of the cavern, serpents slithered forth, fangs sinking into my flesh with searing venom.
Agony exploded through me, blood soaking my clothes in a warm, sticky flood.
Before oblivion claimed me, I caught Cecilia's triumphant cackle.
I twisted my lips into a silent, sardonic smile.
Eight years ago, in front of all the crime lords, Augustine had sworn he'd only ever want me.
But his heart and his vows? They'd soured in just eight short years.
\*\*\*
I spent two weeks in the hospital, nursing my wounds back to health.
During that time, the scandal exploded across Las Vegas: Augustine Clayton, pampering his mistress while letting his own wife bleed out in a snake pit. The whole city was buzzing.
On the day I was discharged, I made good on my promise—I shattered Augustine's father's coffin to pieces.
After venting my fury, I went to see Shelly.
""Shelly,"" I said, stepping into the room.
She opened her eyes, her gaze a tangled mix of pity and resignation.
""Could you pass this divorce agreement to Augustine for me?"" I handed over the papers, along with the newspaper that described my humiliating story.
""Kassandra, men are all the same. You need to wise up. Compared to power and money, love's just a fleeting illusion.
""Only when you stop letting a man control your heart do you truly come out on top.""
The destruction of her husband's coffin didn't faze her in the least.
In their youth, Augustine's father had chased countless mistresses and left a string of illegitimate children. She'd long since lost any illusions about him.
""Shelly, I married Augustine not because he was some rich heir, but because he was Augustine.""
It was love at first sight. Back in the boxing ring, covered in blood, his eyes fierce and unyielding—that image had pierced straight through my soul.
These eight years, leveraging the Clayton family's influence to build arms channels and a network of my own. I was no longer the vulnerable girl who needed his protection.
I'd stayed by his side only because I couldn't let go of that love, even as it rotted away.
""Once you're divorced, his mistresses will trample all over you,"" Shelly said.
I smiled. ""If she's got what it takes, let her try to climb.""
Chapter 3
When it came to Augustine's mistress, I felt nothing.
I knew Cecilia wasn't much of a threat.
A woman like her could only rely on her looks, and no true arms dealer would ever marry a woman who had nothing but a pretty face to offer.
Shelly stayed silent for a long time before finally ordering the maid to take away the divorce papers and the newspaper.
She stared at me for a while, then sighed. ""You know, there are countless women who would kill to be in your position.""
I didn't respond, just offered her a slight, respectful bow, and turned to leave.
Everyone envied me for standing at the pinnacle of power in Las Vegas, but only I knew what it truly cost.
My marriage with Augustine was like a field of poppies—beautiful on the surface but poisonous at its core.
As I stepped out, I ran into Augustine's cousin, Felicia Clayton.
""I thought you'd tolerate him for the rest of your life,"" she said dryly.
""I used to think so too,"" I replied with a faint smile.
She smirked. ""I'll admit, I never really liked you. But between you and that tramp from the red-light district in Mexico, I'd pick you any day.""
""You've been with him for eight years,"" she continued, folding her arms. ""You're really just going to walk away? Don't you feel it's a waste? You could still cash out.""
I chuckled. ""If I stay any longer, I might not make it out alive. What good is his money if I'm dead?""
Felicia burst out laughing. ""Relax. Good men are everywhere! After the divorce, I'll introduce you to someone—better than Augustine, richer than Augustine, and probably more of a gentleman too.""
\*\*\*
That evening, Shelly's maid brought me the signed divorce papers.
I immediately sent them to the courthouse to finalize the process. Then, finally allowing myself to relax, I drew a hot bath.
Just as I was sinking into the water with a glass of red wine, the door burst open. Augustine stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.
He braced his arms on the edge of the tub, trapping me between them, his voice low and lazy. ""Good evening, darling.""
My hand froze midair.
I realized then that Shelly must've tricked him into signing those papers. He clearly had no idea what he'd signed.
Otherwise, he wouldn't still be calling me ""darling.""
I stood, wrapping a robe around myself, and pushed him away coldly.
""Still throwing tantrums?"" he asked, grabbing my wrist. ""Cecilia's nothing. It's over.""
I caught sight of the lipstick smudged on his collar and wrenched my hand free.
""It's not a tantrum. It's disgusting.
""Your taste, Augustine, is as cheap as the perfume Cecilia drowns herself in. It's revolting.""
The next day, for the first time, we didn't attend the Las Vegas jewelry auction together.
Augustine showed up with Cecilia on his arm, stealing the spotlight the moment they walked in.
When I entered the hall, I overheard him introducing Cecilia to the investors as his woman.
Someone spotted me and greeted, ""Mrs. Clayton!""
""Well, if it isn't Mrs. Clayton,"" Cecilia mocked, her tone sugary and cruel. ""That dress looks a little... modest for the occasion, doesn't it?""
I lifted my hand slightly, revealing the emerald ring that symbolized my status as Augustine's wife. ""What I wear doesn't matter,"" I said coolly. ""What matters is that everyone here knows exactly who Mrs. Clayton is.
""Men like to have their fun sometimes. Ms. Webster, not everyone has your... devotion—content to be a mistress for life.""
Onstage, the host invited Augustine and his wife to unveil the centerpiece.
Augustine extended his hand toward me. ""Come on. Don't keep them waiting.""
His intent was obvious—to give me an easy way down and to show the world our marriage was still unshaken.
We unveiled the piece together and delivered our speeches—every move was flawless, every word in perfect harmony.
The soft golden lights traced the angles of his face, so familiar yet so distant.
The warm stage lights traced the mature lines of his profile, and for a moment, I was transported back eight years, to when we had first taken over a smuggling route together.
That night, after securing our first million-dollar deal, he had slipped this very ring onto my finger aboard a yacht.
I smiled and whispered, ""Mr. Clayton, what a wild ride through blood and flames.""
But the human heart, I realized, was far more unpredictable than any gamble in Las Vegas.
Chapter 4
I excused myself from the crowd, claiming I needed some air, and stepped out onto the terrace.
Cecilia followed me out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.
""Ms. Lambert,"" she called, voice dripping with challenge.
I turned, regarding her with cool detachment.
""Four years ago, the night you had your miscarriage, Augustine told you he was away on business,"" she spat, aiming to twist the knife. ""He was actually in my bed.""
I took a slow drag of my cigarette, exhaled, and met her gaze, calm as ever.
""I thought you'd have learned some tact by now,"" I said quietly.
Her eyes flashed. ""He loves me. He said he'd divorce you and marry me. He promised I'd have everything.""
I laughed. The sound came out low, amused, and almost pitying.
""He said that in bed, didn't he? That's his favorite place to make promises.""
I flicked ash off my cigarette. ""Every woman who's come to me has said the same thing. Tell me, what makes you any different?""
I stubbed out the cigarette and turned to leave.
But as I brushed past, she suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""The first time I stepped into his house, I knew you were just lucky,"" she spat. ""You and I came from the same dirt. Why you? Why did you get to be his wife?
""I'm younger. I'm prettier. I should've been the one!""
Her voice shook with anger and envy. ""Please, just divorce him! Let him go!""
I frowned and started to pull away. But suddenly, a deafening crash exploded from below.
The floor shuddered violently, and the terrace rail groaned and began to split.
By the time Augustine and his men rushed in, the terrace had cracked in two. Cecilia and I were stranded on opposite sides, the structure crumbling beneath us.
""Mr. Clayton, the structure won't hold!"" one of his men shouted. ""You've gotta save one first!""
A second collapse could hit any second; whoever got left behind was as good as dead.
Cecilia screamed, sobbing hysterically. My knuckles were white against the ledge.
""Augustine!"" I cried. ""The night I lost our baby—you swore you'd never hurt me again!""
It was all I had left to bargain with. Even if love was gone, maybe his guilt wasn't.
Augustine's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes darting in tortured hesitation.
Then Cecilia shrieked, ""Augustine! I'm pregnant with your child!""
His eyes widened. And in that instant, I knew.
""Save Cecilia first!"" he shouted.
I watched as they pulled her to safety, her tears shining in the chaos.
Then the stone beneath my hands gave way.
Weightlessness hit me like a punch—I plummeted downward, eyes squeezing shut in resignation.
I got it. Cecilia had his child growing inside her; I was just yesterday's flame. How could I compete?
Luck—or irony—saved me.
I crashed into a canopy, which broke my fall.
After a day and night lost to unconsciousness, the rescue team found me.
When I awoke, the media frenzy was in full swing.
The title read, ""Las Vegas Collapse Suspected as Rival Sabotage: Augustine Jets Off to Switzerland with Shaken Lover for Recuperation.""
In the photos, his arm was wrapped protectively around her waist. Their departure date was the same day I was wheeled into surgery.
It was just like when I lost our baby. I'd lain alone in that hospital bed too—abandoned, forgotten.
While Augustine was away, I recovered in silence, enjoying the rare peace.
His deputy kept sending over lavish gifts: orchids air-shipped from France and exquisite jewels that screamed opulence.
I threw every single one out.
When I was finally discharged, I went to my old house in North Las Vegas.
There, I burned everything Augustine had ever given me.
As I walked out of the alley, a black military jeep was parked at the corner.
Augustine stood beside it, watching me.
""Cecilia's pregnant,"" he said quietly.
Chapter 5
Augustine leaned against the hood of his black SUV, lit a cigar, and dropped the bombshell of his mistress's pregnancy.
I didn't flinch.
""According to the agreement, when we divorce, the assets are split sixty–forty. You take the forty."" My voice was steady, emotionless.
""My mother's made it clear—only you can be my wife,"" he continued, his tone smooth, calculated. ""You don't have to worry. Even if Cecilia gives birth, she'll never be allowed to outrank you.
""I can live without a mistress, Kassandra, but not without a wife who can fight alongside me.""
It hit me like a cold splash. He didn't want a divorce, but it was not because he loved me, but because I was still useful to him.
""So what?"" I said coldly. ""I'm not the one keeping you from your true love. It's your mother. If you've got a problem, take it up with her,"" I shot back icily, sidestepping him to walk away.
""My mom wants you at the Clayton's mansion in three days,"" he said behind me. ""Once Cecilia's baby is born, you will be that baby's mother.""
I didn't break stride, my heels clicking defiantly against the pavement.
That night, I took another car back to our villa in Summerlin.
The first thing I did was check my accounts. Several tens of millions of dollars sat quietly in them. A fortune by ordinary standards, but compared to Augustine's arms empire, it was barely a ripple.
They say when a man gains wealth, he loses his morals. And when a woman loses her morals, she gains wealth.
If I were truly heartless, I could've stayed—lived on as Mrs. Clayton in name and enjoyed the money, the diamonds, and the power.
But I was done living a lie. I didn't want to rot away in this gilded cage any longer.
That night, I bought a one-way ticket to Dubai.
I'd leave the moment the divorce papers were finalized.
Three days later, I arrived at the Clayton mansion for the meeting. The air inside was heavy with tension.
The argument revolved entirely around Cecilia—whether she, armed with her pregnancy, could claw her way into legitimacy.
Shelly's tone was firm. ""The child cannot stay. The heir of our family will not be born from a disgrace.""
Augustine tapped his fingers on the table, his voice low but steady. ""Once the baby is born, I'll announce to the public that it's Kassandra's. She can't have kids of her own—this fixes everything perfectly.""
""No,"" Shelly cut him off sharply.
I set down my teacup and said quietly, ""The night I miscarried, you swore you'd never have a child with another woman for as long as you lived.""
Augustine's reply came low and gravelly, laced with weary resignation. ""Kassandra, we can't keep chaining ourselves to old vows forever.""
Before I could respond, a car horn blared outside—the courier had arrived.
I went out to sign for the delivery.
Inside the envelope were two divorce certificates.
I took mine, slipped it neatly into my bag, and turned to go back in.
As I turned my head, I saw Cecilia standing there, eyes burning with hatred.
""Kassandra, I hate you! Why do they all protect you?"" She screamed, her voice shrill and shaking.
I ignored her and moved to pass, but she grabbed my wrist with surprising strength.
""I'll make sure he never looks at you again!"" She shouted, and before I could react, she snatched a fruit knife from the table and plunged it into her own abdomen.
Augustine and others came running at the sound. When they arrived, Cecilia was curled on the floor, blood soaking through her dress.
""Augustine... She tried to kill me... She wanted to kill our baby...""
She gasped, her voice weak but clear enough to condemn me.
""Kassandra!"" Augustine roared. He scooped Cecilia into his arms, his eyes blazing with fury.
I stood there, unmoved. ""If the baby's gone, she has no one to blame but herself.""
The next second, his hand struck my face.
The sharp crack echoed through the hall.
""You evil bitch,"" he hissed, his voice colder than steel. ""We'll settle this when I get back.""
With that, he carried Cecilia out. I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth and watched their car disappear into the distance.
Just then, my phone buzzed—a flight reminder. The plane to Los Angeles would be boarding soon.
Felicia approached quietly and gestured for me to check my messages.
A new text from her read, ""Sandra, I know that wasn't your doing. When you get to Dubai, contact this man. He runs a large arms business... and he's always admired you.""
I looked at the familiar name and number on the screen, then nodded slowly.
""Give this to Augustine,"" I said, handing her the copy of his divorce certificate.
""He's waited eight years for this moment. Tell him congratulations—from me.""
Then I picked up my suitcase and walked away without looking back.
I'd transfer in Los Angeles before heading to Dubai.
At the airport, I paused for a moment, watching the planes lift and vanish into the burning Nevada sky. Then I dialed the number Felicia had sent me.
A low, confident voice answered, warm with amusement. ""Long time no see, Sandra. When you land in Dubai, I'll be there to pick you up.""
""Alright,"" I replied softly.
I closed my eyes for a second, clutching my one-way ticket out of Las Vegas.
In my heart, I whispered, ""Augustine, we've tangled for eight long years.
""It's time I let you go... and set myself free.""

1p1359f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1p1359f/seven_years_for_nothing/,Seven Years for Nothing,"I found out my boyfriend, Edward Ferguson, had just married another woman While we were making love.
""I can't believe you actually married the woman who dumped you back then. What about Esme? She's been so good to you. She loves you!"" his friend shouted.
""I'll stage a fake marriage with her later. She'll never find out."" Edward's voice was cold and impatient. ""You guys just need to keep my marriage to Eliza quiet, don’t let Esme know it.""
I swallowed back my tears. When Edward turned to look at me, I pretended I hadn't understood his Italian and forced a smile.
After he left, I took out my phone and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
\*\*\*
Inside the Maybach, Edward kissed Esmeralda Wallace until she was breathless.
Her clothes were stripped away, while Edward remained perfectly composed in his suit. The stark contrast between them made her cheeks flush with embarrassment.
He pulled her close, chuckling softly by her ear. ""The partition's up. The driver can't hear, and he wouldn't dare listen. What are you so shy about, hmm?""
The elegant man who had always been calm and distant was now rough and unrestrained. Esmeralda wrapped her arms around him, her eyes brimming with love. Just as the wave of pleasure was about to peak, a sudden ringtone shattered the moment.
Annoyed by the interruption, Edward frowned, but when he saw the caller ID, he still picked up.
Gasping for breath, Esmeralda glanced at the name. It was his closest friend, Owen Vazquez.
""Eddie, have you lost your mind—""
Edward's brows furrowed slightly. In flawless Italian, he cut Owen off mid-sentence. ""This isn't the right time. Speak in Italian.""
There was a pause, then Owen's voice came through in Italian, tense and disbelieving. ""You really married Elizabeth? What the hell are you thinking? She dumped you when you went blind trying to save her. She left you for another man and nearly drove you to ruin! And now you're taking her back?""
The words were foreign, but Esmeralda understood every one of them.
When she finally grasped their meaning, a chill swept through her as if she had been plunged into ice.
Edward, oblivious to her reaction, replied flatly, ""If I don't marry her, her family will force her to wed an old man. I can't let that happen.""
""What about Esmeralda? Back when you lost your sight, she was the only one who stayed by your side. She's loved you for years. She practically gave you her heart. All of us have seen it!""
Hearing the barely restrained anger in his voice, Edward remained composed. ""I'll handle it. She'll never find out.""
""How long are you going to hide it from her? Forever? She's been waiting for you to marry her!""
The more he listened, the more irritated Edward became; his voice quickened. ""Keep my marriage to Eliza quiet. Don't breathe a word. I'll stage a fake marriage with Esme later.""
After hanging up, he didn't bother listening to another word from Owen.
He dropped the phone, pushed it aside, and turned his full attention back to Esmeralda beneath him.
She trembled in his arms. Even after they were done and redressed, she couldn't stop shaking. Just as she was about to speak, his phone chimed again.
It was a message notification from a special contact.
He glanced at the screen, then called to the driver.
""Esme, something urgent came up at work. I'll drop you off here. Take a cab home, okay?""
She didn't say a word. She simply nodded in silence and opened the car door.
The black Maybach shot off down the road, leaving her alone on the curb.
Esmeralda's tears finally spilled over as she watched the traffic blur past.
No one knew that to get closer to Edward, Esmeralda had secretly learned Italian long ago.
So she understood every word he and Owen had exchanged.
Each sentence still echoed in her mind like a thousand sharp blades, piercing deep into her heart.
And with that shattering realization, the memories she had buried for years came flooding back.
Edward was the heir born into privilege, while she was only the daughter of a maid.
That year, she followed her mother into the Ferguson family's grand manor and saw him for the first time. He sat under a shaft of sunlight, playing the piano with effortless grace.
She had never heard such beautiful music, nor seen anyone so breathtakingly perfect.
From that single moment, the name Edward was carved deep into her heart.
She never told anyone about the boy she secretly loved.
It wasn't just because of the vast gulf between their worlds, but because she knew Edward already had someone he liked.
His childhood sweetheart's name was Elizabeth Burton.
He cherished her and protected her like a precious jewel.
At 17, he lost his sight in a car accident while saving her.
But after that, Elizabeth vanished from his life completely. She never visited the Ferguson's manor, never called, and soon appeared on someone else's arm.
The Fergusons had other kids, and his parents, always tied up with work, had little time to look after their now-blind son.
So Edward was sent to live alone in the Ferguson's villa.
And it was Esmeralda who volunteered to go there and care for him for seven long years.
When she was 23, she knelt outside a renowned doctor's home for three days and three nights before finally convincing him to come out of retirement and cure Edward's blindness.
The fallen star regained his brilliance.
Within a year, he reclaimed his position as the heir to the Ferguson Group.
Through winter and summer, it was she who stayed by his side. It was she who kept vigil from dusk till dawn. It was she who endured those seven bitter years with him.
She was the one who kissed him, who held him, who shared his bed.
But she never imagined that the first thing he would do after regaining power was to marry the very woman who had once abandoned him—Elizabeth.
For years, she had worked relentlessly to keep up with his pace, to be worthy of standing beside him.
But no matter how much she changed, his parents never accepted her. They kept thinking she wasn't good enough for their son and even tried to pay her to leave.
Every time, Edward fought with his family for her sake. And because of that, she never thought of leaving him.
But it wasn't until today.
Today, Esmeralda no longer wanted to stay by his side.
She wiped her tears away, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
Chapter 2
On the other end of the line, Georgia Ferguson's voice trembled with excitement.
""You finally came to your senses? Good. A maid's daughter like you was never worthy of my son—the heir to the Ferguson family. Where are you now? Come over right away. We'll sign the contract.""
Staring at the address Georgia sent moments later, Esmeralda gave a bitter, mocking smile and hailed a cab.
At the café, Georgia questioned her about everything.
Esmeralda answered each question calmly, and when she was done, Georgia's expression turned satisfied. She took out a document and slid it across the table.
""It's all in writing. Once you sign, I'll transfer half of the money to your account immediately. The remaining half will be sent the day you leave. You must promise that once you take the money, you'll never show your face in front of Eddie again. Ever. Do you understand?""
Esmeralda's eyelashes trembled as she looked at the astronomical compensation figure.
She would never show up again.
In this life or the next, she never wanted to see Edward again.
Without hesitation, she picked up the pen and signed her name cleanly and decisively.
Georgia finally relaxed, putting the contract away as she stood up. Before leaving, she gave one last reminder.
""I'm giving you two weeks. I don't care if you can change your identity or move abroad. Just make sure Eddie never sees you again.""
""I understand, Mrs. Ferguson. You have my word.""
After watching Georgia leave, Esmeralda went home.
Ensuring Edward would never see her again was simple.
The Ferguson family had a long military and political lineage—none of their descendants were allowed to emigrate.
All she had to do was move overseas, and Edward would never be able to reach her.
She spent most of the night researching immigration options and finally decided on Australia.
After making up her mind, she picked up her phone to check the time, only to notice a new post notification on her social feed.
When she opened the post, it was a nine-photo collage from Elizabeth.
The top row showed her holding a bouquet of roses, the middle displayed three marriage certificates, and the bottom showed intertwined hands with matching rings.
Esmeralda knew that since Edward wanted to keep his marriage a secret, he would never have allowed Elizabeth to post it.
But she still did, and she had even set the audience to ""visible only to Esmeralda."" A deliberate show of triumph.
Esmeralda smiled faintly and gave it a like.
The moment she exited the app, a message from Edward appeared.
""Esme, I'm going on a business trip. I won't be home for the next few days.""
She replied with a simple ""Okay,"" put down her phone, and went to wash up.
The next morning, she got up early to start her immigration paperwork.
Since she was in a hurry, she applied for the expedited process.
The clerk assured her it would be completed within two weeks, and only then did she finally breathe a sigh of relief.
Once she got in the car, she scrolled through Elizabeth's social feed again.
This time, half of Edward's figure appeared in the photo.
The two of them were holding hands, touring a new house, and in the end, they had settled on a villa in South Bay Estates.
Just like yesterday, Esmeralda hit the like button.
On the third day, she went to her company and handed in her resignation.
After packing up her things and returning home, she saw yet another update—Elizabeth in a wedding gown, the diamond on her ring finger sparkling brilliantly.
As always, Esmeralda gave it a like, then buried herself under the covers.
The fourth day came, and when she woke up, her feed had another update.
This time, the photo was of the framed wedding portrait hanging in the couple's new home.
Esmeralda stared at it for a long while before snapping out of it.
She liked the post again, then put on makeup and went out to have a farewell dinner with a few close friends.
That evening, she returned home carrying several boxes and began throwing away everything connected to Edward.
All the gifts he had given her, their matching toothbrushes and cups, the photos they had taken together—every trace of him went into the trash.
By the time she finished, it was past midnight.
She was about to turn off the lights when Edward suddenly came home.
He froze at the sight of the half-empty apartment, his brow furrowing.
""Why does it look like half the stuff in here is gone?""
""I didn't like them anymore, so I threw them out. We can always buy new ones later.""
Edward nodded, tossing his jacket onto the couch, but his gaze landed on the boxes stacked nearby.
""You quit your job?""
He paused, then noticed the Social Security card sitting on the coffee table.
""Why did you take that out?""
""I've been tired lately and need a break, so I resigned. The card is for some paperwork I need to handle.""
She answered calmly, packing her things as she spoke.
Seeing how composed she was, Edward didn't suspect anything. Pulling her into his arms, he spoke softly. ""I've been swamped these past few days and haven't had time for you. Your birthday's coming up in a few days. How about I take you to the auction house tomorrow and let you pick something you like?""
Esmeralda didn't refuse.
The next day, as soon as they took their seats in the grand hall, she spotted Elizabeth.
Elizabeth sauntered up confidently and sat down right beside Edward.
All night, Edward kept his attention solely on Esmeralda, never sparing a glance to the side.
When the auction ended, he didn't linger. He simply took her hand and led her downstairs.
Before heading home, Esmeralda stopped at the restroom.
When she came out, she saw Elizabeth cornered on the staircase by a group of arrogant young men. Their mocking laughter echoed through the hall.
""Well, well, isn't this Ms. Burton? The one who dumped Edward after he lost his sight. Looks like retribution finally caught up with you, huh?""
""I heard your father's marrying you off to some dying old man. You're still decent-looking, though. How about you come with us instead? We'd take good care of—""
The rest of his words were cut short.
Edward appeared at the top of the stairs, his expression dark as thunder. Without hesitation, he kicked the men aside with ruthless force.
Chapter 3
Then Edward grabbed the man who had been leading the group, pinned him to the ground, and punched him over and over, mercilessly. Blood splattered; the men cried out, begging for mercy.
""I'm sorry, Mr. Ferguson! Please forgive us and let us go!""
""Get lost! If I ever see you near her again, you'll deal with me personally!""
His furious roar sent the men scrambling away.
A crowd had gathered on the staircase, watching the scene unfold.
Edward ignored the stares and helped Elizabeth to her feet. ""Are you hurt?""
She fell into his arms, tears streaming down her face. ""My ankle hurts a lot.""
His expression darkened. Without hesitation, he scooped her up and pushed through the crowd, holding her close.
In the process of shielding her, his arm brushed hard against Esmeralda, knocking her backward.
Her head struck the sharp edge of a marble step with a sickening thud. Blood began to pour from the wound, making the onlookers gasp.
""She's bleeding! Someone call an ambulance!""
The pain was excruciating. Esmeralda's face twisted as cold sweat covered her skin.
Warm blood seeped between her fingers, dripping onto her eyelashes.
Through the haze, she saw Edward's back as he walked away without even turning around.
Once upon a time, when she had cut her finger while making soup for him, he had fussed for half a day. He insisted on calling a doctor as he was terrified it would scar.
She had teased him for overreacting, and he had lowered his head, kissed her hand, and said softly, ""Esme, you're the person I hold closest to my heart. When you get hurt, it hurts me more. Things are getting better now. You don't need to do all this yourself anymore. You will still have to wear the ring I'm going to give you. It wouldn't look right with a scar.""
Now she was bleeding in front of him, and he didn't even glance her way.
And that ring he had once promised her? It now glittered on another woman's hand.
The ambulance took Esmeralda to the hospital.
She registered herself, saw the doctor, picked up her medication, and went home alone. It was long past midnight when she was done.
That night, the pain kept her awake. She tossed and turned until dawn.
Edward never came home.
The next morning, she dragged her aching body out of bed to change her dressing and saw a new post from Elizabeth.
It was a video of Edward kneeling on one knee, gently massaging her ankle, and applying medicine.
Esmeralda watched it over and over, her eyes reddening before she eventually drifted into a restless sleep.
When she woke, the sky outside was already dark.
Her phone buzzed nonstop beside the pillow. She answered, and Edward's voice came through.
""Come to private room 703 at The Pavilion now.""
Esmeralda hesitated for a moment before getting out of bed.
After washing up, she quickly headed out.
When she pushed open the door, the first person she saw was Elizabeth.
Her eyes were red, her expression pitiful as if she were a fragile little rabbit.
Edward sat across from her, his face unreadable, the air around him heavy with tension.
Silence hung thick in the room until Esmeralda finally spoke.
""Why did you ask me to come here?""
Edward straightened in his seat, clasping his hands together with the poise of someone used to being in control.
""Esme, did you send those men from last night to harass her?""
Esmeralda froze.
Her eyes flicked to Elizabeth, catching the faint glimmer of satisfaction flashing in them.
In that instant, she understood everything. This was all Elizabeth's doing.
She gave a weary, ironic smile. ""No. I don't know those people, and I wouldn't waste my time doing something like that.""
Her calm explanation didn't change the darkness on Edward's face.
He lowered his gaze, his voice even but cold. ""Esme, when Elizabeth left me years ago, I let her go completely. You've been with me for seven years. You should know who's in my heart now. The Burton family has fallen on hard times, and everyone's eager to kick them while they are down. But you shouldn't be one of them. You don't need to make things harder for her because of me.""
His words hit her like a blade twisting deep inside.
Memories of him breaking down in the middle of the night, chasing after doctors, fighting for his sight, and the hopeless diagnosis that he would never see again flooded her mind.
The man, who was born with every advantage, had lost his sight completely for the sake of one girl.
Seven years of devotion, gone with a few indifferent words, as if they'd meant nothing.
She thought of the marriage certificate stamped with both his and Elizabeth's names. Her eyes burned with tears. ""You're right. We've been together seven years, and I'm only now realizing who you truly have in your heart.""
Edward frowned. ""What do you mean by that?""
Esmeralda shook her head with a bitter smile. ""I mean, I'm just a maid's daughter. Do you really think I'd have the money or the connections to hire people like that to humiliate an heiress?""
Even with her words laid bare, he still didn't believe her.
She was too tired to explain any further.
She took a deep breath and asked softly, ""If you don't believe me, just tell me what you want me to do.""
Edward rubbed his temple. ""Apologize. Esme, when you've done something wrong, you should say you're sorry.""
At that moment, Elizabeth, who had been sitting meekly to the side, finally spoke up in a soft, trembling voice.
""No need to apologize. If you truly feel sorry, drink these.""
Chapter 4
The table was lined with glasses of amber-colored whiskey.
Esmeralda's gaze lifted to Edward, searching his face for a clear answer.
But the lighting was dim, and his expression was unreadable in the shadows.
The silence was suffocating; every breath felt like it was draining the air from her lungs.
Her breathing quickened, and a flood of memories surged through her mind.
When she first moved into the Ferguson's villa, Edward, who was blind and bitter, had drowned himself in alcohol every night.
Worried about his health, she had tried to stop him, again and again, but he never listened.
One night, drunk beyond reason, he had sneered at her and pushed several bottles toward her.
""Even a maid's daughter dares to lecture me now? I really have fallen low. Fine. If you drink these, I'll do as you say.""
She had wanted to tell him that she wasn't trying to control him and that she was just worried.
But instead, despite being allergic to alcohol, she had picked up the bottle and drank without hesitation.
Minutes later, she was rushed to the hospital.
When she woke, he was sitting by her bed, his face dark and cold. ""I'm the one who was drunk, not you. You knew you were allergic, so why would you risk your life like that?""
She had only whispered, ""Because I care about you, Mr. Ferguson. Your eyes will heal someday. And even if they don't, I'll still stay with you. So please, don't give up.""
From that day on, Edward quit drinking.
For years after, there wasn't a single bottle of alcohol in the house.
Thinking of that now, Esmeralda smiled faintly, though her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.
Without explaining herself, she reached for the small packet of chili powder beside her and emptied it into one of the glasses. Her tone was steady, final.
""These few glasses hardly prove anything, do they? I'll take this as punishment. Will that be enough for you?""
Before anyone could react, she lifted a glass and drank it down, one after another.
The burning bitterness spread from her tongue down her throat, searing its way through her chest, stomach, and heart—everywhere he'd once lived inside her.
By the seventh glass, Edward finally lost his composure.
""That's enough!""
Esmeralda looked at the untouched glasses left on the table and let out a hollow laugh.
""Enough? So that means I've apologized properly? Have I pleased the woman you love now?""
At that, Edward stood up abruptly and grabbed her wrist.
His usually emotionless face was dark with fury.
""You know that's not what I meant! Esme, I told you that there's nothing between me and Elizabeth anymore. My family doesn't want you marrying into the Ferguson family, and if you keep acting like this, they'll use it against you. I just don't want you to get hurt or be talked about!""
His words sounded righteous, even protective.
But to Esmeralda, they were nothing but excuses.
If the Ferguson family couldn't accept a maid's daughter like her, how could they possibly accept Elizabeth—the woman who had abandoned him?
And yet, despite everything, he had still married her.
Because when it came to love, he had always chosen her.
Esmeralda no longer wanted to argue. She yanked her hand free and turned toward the door.
But before she could take two steps, her body swayed, and everything went black.
""Esme!""
Edward's heart stopped. He lunged forward, catching her before she hit the ground.
As he lifted her into his arms, Elizabeth's trembling voice rose behind him. ""Eddie, I feel dizzy...""
He froze for a second—but only a second.
Then he strode out without looking back.
""I'm taking Esme to the hospital. Call your assistant to take care of you.""
When Esmeralda opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital ward.
Edward, who hadn't slept all night, finally exhaled when he saw her open her eyes.
Their gazes met and lingered for a long time, neither of them saying a word.
He finally poured her a glass of warm water, tucked the blanket around her, then called the doctor to run another check and carefully noted every instruction.
He even canceled all his meetings, despite Donovan Nicholson waiting anxiously outside the door.
Watching that, Esmeralda finally spoke. ""You should go to work. I can take care of myself. This isn't something you need to do.""
His hand paused mid-motion, his voice soft but heavy. ""I should do it, Esme. Don't you remember? You were the one who used to take care of me like this.""
A flicker of confusion crossed her eyes.
Back then, when he had lost his sight and been cast aside by his family, she had stayed.
She had learned Braille to teach him, helped him read, took him for walks in the sun, and cooked all his favorite dishes.
It felt as if she had stolen a piece of the moon for herself. The once-dim world around her was filled with light.
Those seven years had been the happiest of her life.
But the moon was never hers. Now, she couldn't go back.
That afternoon, the doctor escorted her to the examination room.
Half an hour later, a nurse helped her back to her ward.
As she pushed the door open, she saw Edward holding her phone, his brow furrowed and his voice cold as he spoke to Georgia.
""I've told you before that Esme and I love each other. I don't care about her background. You can stop interfering. I'm going to marry her, and she's not leaving me.""
Hearing the sound, he looked up at her, and a moment later, Georgia's puzzled voice came through the phone.
""What do you mean she's not leaving? Didn't you know? Esmeralda already agreed to leave the country a few days ago...""
Chapter 5
The conversation on the phone cut off abruptly.
Esmeralda stumbled forward on unsteady feet, snatched her phone from Edward's hand, and ended the call.
Startled, he stared at her, unable to understand why she looked so shaken.
""What's wrong?""
Seeing his confused expression, she realized he hadn't heard what Georgia said at the end.
She breathed a sigh of relief. She looked away and forced her voice to stay calm. ""It's nothing. I just don't want you arguing with your family over me anymore.""
The Ferguson family had been in constant turmoil over their relationship, doing everything they could to break them apart. He had fought with them more than once because of her.
Her words soothed him enough that he didn't press further. Instead, he asked about her test results.
""The doctor said it's nothing serious. I can be discharged.""
In the days after they returned home, Edward barely went out at all. He stayed by Esmeralda's side the entire time.
But she was no longer the cheerful, lively woman she once was. She often sat in the corner in silence, staring into nothing, her spirit dimmed.
He couldn't figure out what was wrong. When he tried to hold her and comfort her, she quietly stood up and said, ""I don't feel well. I'm going to rest for a bit.""
Her distance caught him off guard.
He assumed she was still upset about what had happened that night, so he decided to surprise her.
For her birthday, he organized a grand celebration.
Out of respect for Edward, nearly everyone in his circle attended.
In his presence, they were polite to Esmeralda.
But the moment he stepped away, their words turned sharp and cruel.
""If it weren't for Mr. Ferguson, I'd never come to a maid's daughter's birthday party. Just being here feels beneath me.""
""I can't imagine what he sees in her. She reeks of cheapness and small-town air.""
""Mr. Ferguson's loyal, I'll give him that. But if it were me, I'd pay her off and be done with it. Marrying her would disgrace the entire Ferguson family!""
Even though she was the guest of honor, Esmeralda stood alone at the party, unnoticed and forgotten.
Their whispered insults pricked at her from every direction, and exhaustion pressed down on her like a weight.
If not for the fear of making Edward suspicious, she would never have come.
Every minute of that evening felt unbearable.
Around 7:00 p.m., the atmosphere suddenly shifted.
All at once, the guests turned toward the entrance. The disdain on their faces vanished, replaced by eager smiles.
News traveled fast in their circle. Everyone knew about Edward's public fight over Elizabeth. Seeing him now, it was obvious he still cared, and so they rushed to flatter him without hesitation.
""Mr. Ferguson, so you stepped out earlier to pick up Ms. Burton! After all these years, your bond is still strong!""
""Of course it is! They're childhood sweethearts. Just look at her. She's elegant and graceful. She and Mr. Ferguson make the perfect pair.""
As the crowd murmured approvingly, Esmeralda turned and saw Elizabeth walking in, arm linked with Edward's.
She wore a luxurious designer gown, her diamond necklace glittering under the chandelier. Her delicate features and poised demeanor exuded the kind of effortless refinement that only wealth could cultivate.
Even beside Edward's commanding presence, she stood her ground flawlessly.
A pang twisted in Esmeralda's chest. She suddenly remembered the faceless sketch Edward had once drawn after regaining his sight.
He'd said it was just something he'd drawn for fun. She hadn't thought much of it then, only that it was beautiful.
But now, seeing Elizabeth, she finally understood who the woman in that sketch had been.
It had never been about rekindling a lost love. He had never stopped loving her in the first place.
Lowering her gaze, Esmeralda turned to leave, but Elizabeth's voice rang out behind her.
""Ms. Wallace! I heard that it's your birthday today. I hope you don't mind me crashing the party. I brought you a gift.""
She motioned to someone, who led over a small, snow-white puppy on a leash.
""His name is Ralda. Isn't he adorable?""
The playful puppy bounded toward her, tail wagging. Esmeralda instinctively stumbled back, bumping into the table behind her.
Her face went pale, panic flickering in her eyes.
""Please take it away. I don't like dogs.""
Chapter 6
At her words, Elizabeth's smile faltered.
""Eddie, is Ms. Wallace still upset about what happened last time? Maybe I should go. I don't want to make things awkward.""
She turned to leave, but Edward quickly stopped her, frowning at Esmeralda.
""She meant well, Esme. Don't you love animals? Just take it.""
Seeing the faint irritation in his eyes, Esmeralda clenched her hands so tightly her nails dug into her palms. She turned toward Donovan instead.
""Mr. Nicholson, I'm wearing heels. Would you mind holding the dog for me?""
The people around her started whispering again, their tones dripping with mockery, saying she didn't know her place and loved to put on airs.
Edward seemed to think the same—that she was deliberately giving Elizabeth the cold shoulder—so he led her inside, his expression dark and unreadable.
Soon the hall emptied, and she was alone.
She poured herself a glass of water, trying to calm her trembling hands and the panic rising in her chest.
Once, she really had loved dogs.
But five years earlier, during a violent storm and blackout, Edward had fallen dangerously ill with a high fever. She'd run through the rain to find a doctor.
A neighbor's dog had chased her down the street and bitten into her leg, tearing away flesh.
She endured the pain until she was sure he was safe before getting her wound treated.
Since then, she had been terrified of dogs. But she never told him because she didn't want him to worry.
Even through the thin fabric of her dress, she could still feel the scar beneath her skin.
The guests, ever quick to take cues from power, now treated her with open disdain after seeing Edward's indifference.
When it came time for the celebration, everyone gathered around Elizabeth as if she were the one being honored.
When Edward's mood finally lightened, he called Esmeralda over to blow out the candles.
She walked over quietly, just as Elizabeth let out a delighted exclamation.
""Oh wow! What a coincidence! Ms. Wallace, the puppy shares your birthday. Why don't you two celebrate together?""
Laughter rippled through the crowd, muffled behind hands.
Esmeralda's nails bit deeper into her palms when she caught the taunting glint in Elizabeth's eyes.
She drew a slow breath and said coldly, ""In that case, let the puppy blow out the candles. Everyone can sing to it instead. I'll excuse myself.""
As she turned to leave, Edward's jaw tightened.
""Esme! This is your birthday party. What will others think if you walk out now?""
She ignored him and kept going.
Losing patience, Edward caught up to her, gripping her wrist and murmuring sharply in her ear before guiding her back to the cake.
""Be reasonable. Everyone here moves in the same circles. If you storm off now, the gossip will get back to my family, and they'll be even more against us.""
Against us? What us?
He had already married Elizabeth. What was there left for them to oppose?
All around her, the cheerful tune of ""Happy Birthday"" began to play.
Esmeralda's lips curved slightly, but her face was frozen like a statue carved from ice.
Someone suddenly picked up the puppy and placed it in her arms. Goosebumps prickled across her skin.
Midway through the song, the puppy squirmed free, leaping out of her hold.
It barreled straight into the towering champagne display. The tower collapsed toward Esmeralda and Elizabeth.
Screams erupted around the hall as glass shattered and liquid splashed everywhere.
Through the chaos, Esmeralda saw one clear image—Edward shielding Elizabeth with his body, pulling her out of harm's way.
The falling glass struck Esmeralda instead, slicing her shoulder open.
Blood streaked down her arm, staining her white dress crimson.
She collapsed to the floor with a stifled groan, cold sweat beading across her forehead.
Hearing the commotion, Edward turned around. Seeing her injured, he took a step forward, but then Elizabeth shrieked.
""Eddie! The puppy scratched me! What if it has rabies?""
He glanced at the faint red mark on her ankle, hesitated for a moment, then gave a curt order to Donovan.
""Take Esme to the hospital to treat her wounds.""
And with that, he left with Elizabeth.
The guests began to file out as well, each one tossing in a parting jab before they left.
""Ralda, Esmeralda—Ms. Wallace really does know how to pick a name, doesn't she? She's just like a stray dog that's lost its home.""
""Don't insult the puppy! Ralda's adorable—unlike certain mangy dogs who think they can climb too high.""
Every word cut deep, echoing painfully in Esmeralda's ears.
She looked down at her torn, bloodstained dress and the chaos around her. Her throat burned, her nose stung, and tears welled up uncontrollably.
The ""Happy Birthday"" sign above the cake came loose and fell, landing right at her feet.
She picked it up, staring at the empty, wrecked hall as the last of the guests disappeared. Finally, her tears fell freely.
Her 23rd birthday had ended in ruins.
Chapter 7
It was nearly dawn when Esmeralda finally dragged her exhausted body home.
The moment she turned on the lights, her phone buzzed several times.
It was a series of messages from Elizabeth.
""You've been liking all my posts lately, so I'm sure you already know that Eddie and I got our marriage certificate, right? He even promised me a wedding in the Maldives. I've seen the plans, and they're magnificent. Every single detail is just like what we dreamed of when we were young. I can't believe he still remembers after all these years.
""I really should thank you. If it weren't for you, he would still be blind. You took such good care of my husband for seven whole years. I owe you for that.""
The taunting words flashed across the screen, bold and unrestrained. Esmeralda didn't even have the strength to be angry anymore.
She set her phone aside, lay back on the bed, and drifted into a deep, heavy sleep.
That night, Edward still didn't come home. He only sent a short message.
""Esme, I still have some things to handle. Are your injuries bad? If they hurt too much, tell me and I'll come back right away.""
She stared at the message for a long time, her expression unreadable, before typing a single reply.
""Don't bother.""
She thought, ""Edward, from this moment on, I'll never need you anymore.""
When her shoulder wound finally scabbed over, Esmeralda went alone to the Ferguson's villa.
It was the place she and Edward had lived together when he was blind.
She picked up a shovel and walked to the old tree in the courtyard.
Beneath it was something they had buried on his 18th birthday—their ""shared wishes.""
She dug carefully until a small iron box appeared. The metal was rusted, the glass jar inside fogged with moisture.
She opened it, unfolded a star-shaped slip of paper, and saw her own handwriting.
""I hope Eddie can see the world again. I hope his life will be peaceful. I hope I can stay by his side forever.""
Every wish she had made was about him.
Some had come true.
Some never would.
She then unfolded the paper he had written.
""I wish to see again. I wish Eliza a lifetime of happiness.""
Every word was about him and Elizabeth, not her.
So he truly had never blamed Elizabeth for abandoning him. He had risked everything for her, suffered blindness for her, and had never once regretted it.
A bitter smile touched Esmeralda's lips. She tore up her own note and tossed the pieces down the drain. Then, she reached for the necklace around her neck.
It was the first gift he had ever bought her—with the money he earned from his very first deal after returning to the Ferguson family.
She had scolded him for spending so much, but he had just held her close, kissing her forehead with a smile.
""Esme, they say it's cold at the top, but as long as you're with me, I'll always have the strength to keep climbing. It's just a necklace. One day, everything I have, including me, will belong to you.""
Now, she buried that necklace, along with everything else that had ever tied her to him.
When the dirt was leveled, she turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, she ran into Edward and Elizabeth.
His expression flickered with surprise.
""Esme? What are you doing here?""
She looked at him calmly and asked, ""What about you? What are you doing here with her?""
Before he could answer, Elizabeth smiled sweetly and spoke first. ""It's been so long since I heard Eddie play the piano. He said the one he used is still here at the Ferguson's villa, so we came to pick it up. Ms. Wallace, you know this place best. Why don't you show us the way?""
Without waiting for permission, she linked her arm through Esmeralda's and started leading her toward the manor.",1,1763544725.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1p134x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetLabCo/comments/1p134x1/why_your_dog_is_throwing_up_clear_liquid_after/,Why your dog is throwing up clear liquid after drinking water,"Watching your dog throw up clear liquid can be confusing, especially if it happens soon after they have had a big drink. Clear vomit is usually made up of water, saliva, and stomach juices.

Some of the more common reasons for clear vomit include:

* Drinking water very quickly after play or exercise
* Having an empty stomach for a long stretch of time
* Mild digestive upset or sensitivity

Other causes range from reflux type issues through to gastritis, intestinal blockage, or more serious illness, especially if there is foam, yellow or brown staining, or food mixed in. Frequency and other symptoms matter a lot here.

Give your vet a call if:

* Your dog vomits clear liquid more than once
* You notice blood, coffee ground material, or a very sour smell
* Your dog seems tired, in pain, or refuses food or water

If your vet is comfortable that nothing urgent is going on, they may suggest steps like smaller meals, moderating access to water after heavy exercise, or adjusting feeding times. Always follow their advice for your individual dog.

1p1349r,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1p1349r/30_days_sugar_free/,30 days sugar free!,"Yesterday I completed 30 days added sugar free. I still ate bread and pasta but sourdough and wholemeal only - this is because I am breastfeeding my 9mo so I didn't want to change my diet too much in one go. Before this, I would have Nutella each morning in my oats, and always a sweet snack (cereal bar, biscuits etc) in the mid afternoon and often a dessert after dinner. I'd also get cake with my coffee a few times a week.

I'll caveat this with saying I am a healthy weight and my diet in about 80-90% UPF-free, cooking all three meals from scratch at home.

The first week I had this crazy weird hunger, was so thirsty and was incredibly fatigued. I also had crazy bloating. This eased for a day or two around day 10 but then my preschooler brought home a stomach bug which preceded a cold virus so my gut was just awful for a week - nausea, bloating etc. I was also just so tired from the cold that followed.

In the third week I started to recover and in the last few days I have felt incredible. I don't experience hunger through the day anymore - I eat three meals and one afternoon snack but there's no cravings or food noise inbetween. My skin is GLOWING and I have had no bloating for the last week.

 I am sleeping so much better and do not feel hungry in the night when I wake to feed the baby. I have also lost 2.1kg, but this is neither here nor there as I have been losing about 2kg a month of baby weight since April. I do look a lot leaner though, I feel like I have lost a lot of water weight and reduced inflammation.

My main reasons for doing this were to help with my skin and bloating - I do have mild/lean PCOS and struggle with my cycle (when I'm not breastfeeding) so I'm hoping when I wean after Christmas, being sugar free will stand me in good stead.

I plan on having some cheat days over the holidays, but I have marked them on the calendar, such as my work's Christmas meal, Christmas Day etc. so that I can stick to being sugar free the rest of the time. In the new year, I intend to cut out bread once I've weaned.

Overall I didn't find it that difficult? I never had proper cravings for sugar like I did when I quit smoking 13 years ago. I would think of it in passing at the times I would usually have it, but never felt the real urge to indulge. I even celebrated my birthday during the challenge and didn't have any chocolate that I was gifted or a slice of birthday cake!

""I can't believe you actually married the woman who dumped you back then. What about Esme? She's been so good to you. She loves you!"" his friend shouted.
""I'll stage a fake marriage with her later. She'll never find out."" Edward's voice was cold and impatient. ""You guys just need to keep my marriage to Eliza quiet, don’t let Esme know it.""
I swallowed back my tears. When Edward turned to look at me, I pretended I hadn't understood his Italian and forced a smile.
After he left, I took out my phone and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
\*\*\*
Inside the Maybach, Edward kissed Esmeralda Wallace until she was breathless.
Her clothes were stripped away, while Edward remained perfectly composed in his suit. The stark contrast between them made her cheeks flush with embarrassment.
He pulled her close, chuckling softly by her ear. ""The partition's up. The driver can't hear, and he wouldn't dare listen. What are you so shy about, hmm?""
The elegant man who had always been calm and distant was now rough and unrestrained. Esmeralda wrapped her arms around him, her eyes brimming with love. Just as the wave of pleasure was about to peak, a sudden ringtone shattered the moment.
Annoyed by the interruption, Edward frowned, but when he saw the caller ID, he still picked up.
Gasping for breath, Esmeralda glanced at the name. It was his closest friend, Owen Vazquez.
""Eddie, have you lost your mind—""
Edward's brows furrowed slightly. In flawless Italian, he cut Owen off mid-sentence. ""This isn't the right time. Speak in Italian.""
There was a pause, then Owen's voice came through in Italian, tense and disbelieving. ""You really married Elizabeth? What the hell are you thinking? She dumped you when you went blind trying to save her. She left you for another man and nearly drove you to ruin! And now you're taking her back?""
The words were foreign, but Esmeralda understood every one of them.
When she finally grasped their meaning, a chill swept through her as if she had been plunged into ice.
Edward, oblivious to her reaction, replied flatly, ""If I don't marry her, her family will force her to wed an old man. I can't let that happen.""
""What about Esmeralda? Back when you lost your sight, she was the only one who stayed by your side. She's loved you for years. She practically gave you her heart. All of us have seen it!""
Hearing the barely restrained anger in his voice, Edward remained composed. ""I'll handle it. She'll never find out.""
""How long are you going to hide it from her? Forever? She's been waiting for you to marry her!""
The more he listened, the more irritated Edward became; his voice quickened. ""Keep my marriage to Eliza quiet. Don't breathe a word. I'll stage a fake marriage with Esme later.""
After hanging up, he didn't bother listening to another word from Owen.
He dropped the phone, pushed it aside, and turned his full attention back to Esmeralda beneath him.
She trembled in his arms. Even after they were done and redressed, she couldn't stop shaking. Just as she was about to speak, his phone chimed again.
It was a message notification from a special contact.
He glanced at the screen, then called to the driver.
""Esme, something urgent came up at work. I'll drop you off here. Take a cab home, okay?""
She didn't say a word. She simply nodded in silence and opened the car door.
The black Maybach shot off down the road, leaving her alone on the curb.
Esmeralda's tears finally spilled over as she watched the traffic blur past.
No one knew that to get closer to Edward, Esmeralda had secretly learned Italian long ago.
So she understood every word he and Owen had exchanged.
Each sentence still echoed in her mind like a thousand sharp blades, piercing deep into her heart.
And with that shattering realization, the memories she had buried for years came flooding back.
Edward was the heir born into privilege, while she was only the daughter of a maid.
That year, she followed her mother into the Ferguson family's grand manor and saw him for the first time. He sat under a shaft of sunlight, playing the piano with effortless grace.
She had never heard such beautiful music, nor seen anyone so breathtakingly perfect.
From that single moment, the name Edward was carved deep into her heart.
She never told anyone about the boy she secretly loved.
It wasn't just because of the vast gulf between their worlds, but because she knew Edward already had someone he liked.
His childhood sweetheart's name was Elizabeth Burton.
He cherished her and protected her like a precious jewel.
At 17, he lost his sight in a car accident while saving her.
But after that, Elizabeth vanished from his life completely. She never visited the Ferguson's manor, never called, and soon appeared on someone else's arm.
The Fergusons had other kids, and his parents, always tied up with work, had little time to look after their now-blind son.
So Edward was sent to live alone in the Ferguson's villa.
And it was Esmeralda who volunteered to go there and care for him for seven long years.
When she was 23, she knelt outside a renowned doctor's home for three days and three nights before finally convincing him to come out of retirement and cure Edward's blindness.
The fallen star regained his brilliance.
Within a year, he reclaimed his position as the heir to the Ferguson Group.
Through winter and summer, it was she who stayed by his side. It was she who kept vigil from dusk till dawn. It was she who endured those seven bitter years with him.
She was the one who kissed him, who held him, who shared his bed.
But she never imagined that the first thing he would do after regaining power was to marry the very woman who had once abandoned him—Elizabeth.
For years, she had worked relentlessly to keep up with his pace, to be worthy of standing beside him.
But no matter how much she changed, his parents never accepted her. They kept thinking she wasn't good enough for their son and even tried to pay her to leave.
Every time, Edward fought with his family for her sake. And because of that, she never thought of leaving him.
But it wasn't until today.
Today, Esmeralda no longer wanted to stay by his side.
She wiped her tears away, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
Chapter 2
On the other end of the line, Georgia Ferguson's voice trembled with excitement.
""You finally came to your senses? Good. A maid's daughter like you was never worthy of my son—the heir to the Ferguson family. Where are you now? Come over right away. We'll sign the contract.""
Staring at the address Georgia sent moments later, Esmeralda gave a bitter, mocking smile and hailed a cab.
At the café, Georgia questioned her about everything.
Esmeralda answered each question calmly, and when she was done, Georgia's expression turned satisfied. She took out a document and slid it across the table.
""It's all in writing. Once you sign, I'll transfer half of the money to your account immediately. The remaining half will be sent the day you leave. You must promise that once you take the money, you'll never show your face in front of Eddie again. Ever. Do you understand?""
Esmeralda's eyelashes trembled as she looked at the astronomical compensation figure.
She would never show up again.
In this life or the next, she never wanted to see Edward again.
Without hesitation, she picked up the pen and signed her name cleanly and decisively.
Georgia finally relaxed, putting the contract away as she stood up. Before leaving, she gave one last reminder.
""I'm giving you two weeks. I don't care if you can change your identity or move abroad. Just make sure Eddie never sees you again.""
""I understand, Mrs. Ferguson. You have my word.""
After watching Georgia leave, Esmeralda went home.
Ensuring Edward would never see her again was simple.
The Ferguson family had a long military and political lineage—none of their descendants were allowed to emigrate.
All she had to do was move overseas, and Edward would never be able to reach her.
She spent most of the night researching immigration options and finally decided on Australia.
After making up her mind, she picked up her phone to check the time, only to notice a new post notification on her social feed.
When she opened the post, it was a nine-photo collage from Elizabeth.
The top row showed her holding a bouquet of roses, the middle displayed three marriage certificates, and the bottom showed intertwined hands with matching rings.
Esmeralda knew that since Edward wanted to keep his marriage a secret, he would never have allowed Elizabeth to post it.
But she still did, and she had even set the audience to ""visible only to Esmeralda."" A deliberate show of triumph.
Esmeralda smiled faintly and gave it a like.
The moment she exited the app, a message from Edward appeared.
""Esme, I'm going on a business trip. I won't be home for the next few days.""
She replied with a simple ""Okay,"" put down her phone, and went to wash up.
The next morning, she got up early to start her immigration paperwork.
Since she was in a hurry, she applied for the expedited process.
The clerk assured her it would be completed within two weeks, and only then did she finally breathe a sigh of relief.
Once she got in the car, she scrolled through Elizabeth's social feed again.
This time, half of Edward's figure appeared in the photo.
The two of them were holding hands, touring a new house, and in the end, they had settled on a villa in South Bay Estates.
Just like yesterday, Esmeralda hit the like button.
On the third day, she went to her company and handed in her resignation.
After packing up her things and returning home, she saw yet another update—Elizabeth in a wedding gown, the diamond on her ring finger sparkling brilliantly.
As always, Esmeralda gave it a like, then buried herself under the covers.
The fourth day came, and when she woke up, her feed had another update.
This time, the photo was of the framed wedding portrait hanging in the couple's new home.
Esmeralda stared at it for a long while before snapping out of it.
She liked the post again, then put on makeup and went out to have a farewell dinner with a few close friends.
That evening, she returned home carrying several boxes and began throwing away everything connected to Edward.
All the gifts he had given her, their matching toothbrushes and cups, the photos they had taken together—every trace of him went into the trash.
By the time she finished, it was past midnight.
She was about to turn off the lights when Edward suddenly came home.
He froze at the sight of the half-empty apartment, his brow furrowing.
""Why does it look like half the stuff in here is gone?""
""I didn't like them anymore, so I threw them out. We can always buy new ones later.""
Edward nodded, tossing his jacket onto the couch, but his gaze landed on the boxes stacked nearby.
""You quit your job?""
He paused, then noticed the Social Security card sitting on the coffee table.
""Why did you take that out?""
""I've been tired lately and need a break, so I resigned. The card is for some paperwork I need to handle.""
She answered calmly, packing her things as she spoke.
Seeing how composed she was, Edward didn't suspect anything. Pulling her into his arms, he spoke softly. ""I've been swamped these past few days and haven't had time for you. Your birthday's coming up in a few days. How about I take you to the auction house tomorrow and let you pick something you like?""
Esmeralda didn't refuse.
The next day, as soon as they took their seats in the grand hall, she spotted Elizabeth.
Elizabeth sauntered up confidently and sat down right beside Edward.
All night, Edward kept his attention solely on Esmeralda, never sparing a glance to the side.
When the auction ended, he didn't linger. He simply took her hand and led her downstairs.
Before heading home, Esmeralda stopped at the restroom.
When she came out, she saw Elizabeth cornered on the staircase by a group of arrogant young men. Their mocking laughter echoed through the hall.
""Well, well, isn't this Ms. Burton? The one who dumped Edward after he lost his sight. Looks like retribution finally caught up with you, huh?""
""I heard your father's marrying you off to some dying old man. You're still decent-looking, though. How about you come with us instead? We'd take good care of—""
The rest of his words were cut short.
Edward appeared at the top of the stairs, his expression dark as thunder. Without hesitation, he kicked the men aside with ruthless force.
Chapter 3
Then Edward grabbed the man who had been leading the group, pinned him to the ground, and punched him over and over, mercilessly. Blood splattered; the men cried out, begging for mercy.
""I'm sorry, Mr. Ferguson! Please forgive us and let us go!""
""Get lost! If I ever see you near her again, you'll deal with me personally!""
His furious roar sent the men scrambling away.
A crowd had gathered on the staircase, watching the scene unfold.
Edward ignored the stares and helped Elizabeth to her feet. ""Are you hurt?""
She fell into his arms, tears streaming down her face. ""My ankle hurts a lot.""
His expression darkened. Without hesitation, he scooped her up and pushed through the crowd, holding her close.
In the process of shielding her, his arm brushed hard against Esmeralda, knocking her backward.
Her head struck the sharp edge of a marble step with a sickening thud. Blood began to pour from the wound, making the onlookers gasp.
""She's bleeding! Someone call an ambulance!""
The pain was excruciating. Esmeralda's face twisted as cold sweat covered her skin.
Warm blood seeped between her fingers, dripping onto her eyelashes.
Through the haze, she saw Edward's back as he walked away without even turning around.
Once upon a time, when she had cut her finger while making soup for him, he had fussed for half a day. He insisted on calling a doctor as he was terrified it would scar.
She had teased him for overreacting, and he had lowered his head, kissed her hand, and said softly, ""Esme, you're the person I hold closest to my heart. When you get hurt, it hurts me more. Things are getting better now. You don't need to do all this yourself anymore. You will still have to wear the ring I'm going to give you. It wouldn't look right with a scar.""
Now she was bleeding in front of him, and he didn't even glance her way.
And that ring he had once promised her? It now glittered on another woman's hand.
The ambulance took Esmeralda to the hospital.
She registered herself, saw the doctor, picked up her medication, and went home alone. It was long past midnight when she was done.
That night, the pain kept her awake. She tossed and turned until dawn.
Edward never came home.
The next morning, she dragged her aching body out of bed to change her dressing and saw a new post from Elizabeth.
It was a video of Edward kneeling on one knee, gently massaging her ankle, and applying medicine.
Esmeralda watched it over and over, her eyes reddening before she eventually drifted into a restless sleep.
When she woke, the sky outside was already dark.
Her phone buzzed nonstop beside the pillow. She answered, and Edward's voice came through.
""Come to private room 703 at The Pavilion now.""
Esmeralda hesitated for a moment before getting out of bed.
After washing up, she quickly headed out.
When she pushed open the door, the first person she saw was Elizabeth.
Her eyes were red, her expression pitiful as if she were a fragile little rabbit.
Edward sat across from her, his face unreadable, the air around him heavy with tension.
Silence hung thick in the room until Esmeralda finally spoke.
""Why did you ask me to come here?""
Edward straightened in his seat, clasping his hands together with the poise of someone used to being in control.
""Esme, did you send those men from last night to harass her?""
Esmeralda froze.
Her eyes flicked to Elizabeth, catching the faint glimmer of satisfaction flashing in them.
In that instant, she understood everything. This was all Elizabeth's doing.
She gave a weary, ironic smile. ""No. I don't know those people, and I wouldn't waste my time doing something like that.""
Her calm explanation didn't change the darkness on Edward's face.
He lowered his gaze, his voice even but cold. ""Esme, when Elizabeth left me years ago, I let her go completely. You've been with me for seven years. You should know who's in my heart now. The Burton family has fallen on hard times, and everyone's eager to kick them while they are down. But you shouldn't be one of them. You don't need to make things harder for her because of me.""
His words hit her like a blade twisting deep inside.
Memories of him breaking down in the middle of the night, chasing after doctors, fighting for his sight, and the hopeless diagnosis that he would never see again flooded her mind.
The man, who was born with every advantage, had lost his sight completely for the sake of one girl.
Seven years of devotion, gone with a few indifferent words, as if they'd meant nothing.
She thought of the marriage certificate stamped with both his and Elizabeth's names. Her eyes burned with tears. ""You're right. We've been together seven years, and I'm only now realizing who you truly have in your heart.""
Edward frowned. ""What do you mean by that?""
Esmeralda shook her head with a bitter smile. ""I mean, I'm just a maid's daughter. Do you really think I'd have the money or the connections to hire people like that to humiliate an heiress?""
Even with her words laid bare, he still didn't believe her.
She was too tired to explain any further.
She took a deep breath and asked softly, ""If you don't believe me, just tell me what you want me to do.""
Edward rubbed his temple. ""Apologize. Esme, when you've done something wrong, you should say you're sorry.""
At that moment, Elizabeth, who had been sitting meekly to the side, finally spoke up in a soft, trembling voice.
""No need to apologize. If you truly feel sorry, drink these.""
Chapter 4
The table was lined with glasses of amber-colored whiskey.
Esmeralda's gaze lifted to Edward, searching his face for a clear answer.
But the lighting was dim, and his expression was unreadable in the shadows.
The silence was suffocating; every breath felt like it was draining the air from her lungs.
Her breathing quickened, and a flood of memories surged through her mind.
When she first moved into the Ferguson's villa, Edward, who was blind and bitter, had drowned himself in alcohol every night.
Worried about his health, she had tried to stop him, again and again, but he never listened.
One night, drunk beyond reason, he had sneered at her and pushed several bottles toward her.
""Even a maid's daughter dares to lecture me now? I really have fallen low. Fine. If you drink these, I'll do as you say.""
She had wanted to tell him that she wasn't trying to control him and that she was just worried.
But instead, despite being allergic to alcohol, she had picked up the bottle and drank without hesitation.
Minutes later, she was rushed to the hospital.
When she woke, he was sitting by her bed, his face dark and cold. ""I'm the one who was drunk, not you. You knew you were allergic, so why would you risk your life like that?""
She had only whispered, ""Because I care about you, Mr. Ferguson. Your eyes will heal someday. And even if they don't, I'll still stay with you. So please, don't give up.""
From that day on, Edward quit drinking.
For years after, there wasn't a single bottle of alcohol in the house.
Thinking of that now, Esmeralda smiled faintly, though her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.
Without explaining herself, she reached for the small packet of chili powder beside her and emptied it into one of the glasses. Her tone was steady, final.
""These few glasses hardly prove anything, do they? I'll take this as punishment. Will that be enough for you?""
Before anyone could react, she lifted a glass and drank it down, one after another.
The burning bitterness spread from her tongue down her throat, searing its way through her chest, stomach, and heart—everywhere he'd once lived inside her.
By the seventh glass, Edward finally lost his composure.
""That's enough!""
Esmeralda looked at the untouched glasses left on the table and let out a hollow laugh.
""Enough? So that means I've apologized properly? Have I pleased the woman you love now?""
At that, Edward stood up abruptly and grabbed her wrist.
His usually emotionless face was dark with fury.
""You know that's not what I meant! Esme, I told you that there's nothing between me and Elizabeth anymore. My family doesn't want you marrying into the Ferguson family, and if you keep acting like this, they'll use it against you. I just don't want you to get hurt or be talked about!""
His words sounded righteous, even protective.
But to Esmeralda, they were nothing but excuses.
If the Ferguson family couldn't accept a maid's daughter like her, how could they possibly accept Elizabeth—the woman who had abandoned him?
And yet, despite everything, he had still married her.
Because when it came to love, he had always chosen her.
Esmeralda no longer wanted to argue. She yanked her hand free and turned toward the door.
But before she could take two steps, her body swayed, and everything went black.
""Esme!""
Edward's heart stopped. He lunged forward, catching her before she hit the ground.
As he lifted her into his arms, Elizabeth's trembling voice rose behind him. ""Eddie, I feel dizzy...""
He froze for a second—but only a second.
Then he strode out without looking back.
""I'm taking Esme to the hospital. Call your assistant to take care of you.""
When Esmeralda opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital ward.
Edward, who hadn't slept all night, finally exhaled when he saw her open her eyes.
Their gazes met and lingered for a long time, neither of them saying a word.
He finally poured her a glass of warm water, tucked the blanket around her, then called the doctor to run another check and carefully noted every instruction.
He even canceled all his meetings, despite Donovan Nicholson waiting anxiously outside the door.
Watching that, Esmeralda finally spoke. ""You should go to work. I can take care of myself. This isn't something you need to do.""
His hand paused mid-motion, his voice soft but heavy. ""I should do it, Esme. Don't you remember? You were the one who used to take care of me like this.""
A flicker of confusion crossed her eyes.
Back then, when he had lost his sight and been cast aside by his family, she had stayed.
She had learned Braille to teach him, helped him read, took him for walks in the sun, and cooked all his favorite dishes.
It felt as if she had stolen a piece of the moon for herself. The once-dim world around her was filled with light.
Those seven years had been the happiest of her life.
But the moon was never hers. Now, she couldn't go back.
That afternoon, the doctor escorted her to the examination room.
Half an hour later, a nurse helped her back to her ward.
As she pushed the door open, she saw Edward holding her phone, his brow furrowed and his voice cold as he spoke to Georgia.
""I've told you before that Esme and I love each other. I don't care about her background. You can stop interfering. I'm going to marry her, and she's not leaving me.""
Hearing the sound, he looked up at her, and a moment later, Georgia's puzzled voice came through the phone.
""What do you mean she's not leaving? Didn't you know? Esmeralda already agreed to leave the country a few days ago...""
Chapter 5
The conversation on the phone cut off abruptly.
Esmeralda stumbled forward on unsteady feet, snatched her phone from Edward's hand, and ended the call.
Startled, he stared at her, unable to understand why she looked so shaken.
""What's wrong?""
Seeing his confused expression, she realized he hadn't heard what Georgia said at the end.
She breathed a sigh of relief. She looked away and forced her voice to stay calm. ""It's nothing. I just don't want you arguing with your family over me anymore.""
The Ferguson family had been in constant turmoil over their relationship, doing everything they could to break them apart. He had fought with them more than once because of her.
Her words soothed him enough that he didn't press further. Instead, he asked about her test results.
""The doctor said it's nothing serious. I can be discharged.""
In the days after they returned home, Edward barely went out at all. He stayed by Esmeralda's side the entire time.
But she was no longer the cheerful, lively woman she once was. She often sat in the corner in silence, staring into nothing, her spirit dimmed.
He couldn't figure out what was wrong. When he tried to hold her and comfort her, she quietly stood up and said, ""I don't feel well. I'm going to rest for a bit.""
Her distance caught him off guard.
He assumed she was still upset about what had happened that night, so he decided to surprise her.
For her birthday, he organized a grand celebration.
Out of respect for Edward, nearly everyone in his circle attended.
In his presence, they were polite to Esmeralda.
But the moment he stepped away, their words turned sharp and cruel.
""If it weren't for Mr. Ferguson, I'd never come to a maid's daughter's birthday party. Just being here feels beneath me.""
""I can't imagine what he sees in her. She reeks of cheapness and small-town air.""
""Mr. Ferguson's loyal, I'll give him that. But if it were me, I'd pay her off and be done with it. Marrying her would disgrace the entire Ferguson family!""
Even though she was the guest of honor, Esmeralda stood alone at the party, unnoticed and forgotten.
Their whispered insults pricked at her from every direction, and exhaustion pressed down on her like a weight.
If not for the fear of making Edward suspicious, she would never have come.
Every minute of that evening felt unbearable.
Around 7:00 p.m., the atmosphere suddenly shifted.
All at once, the guests turned toward the entrance. The disdain on their faces vanished, replaced by eager smiles.
News traveled fast in their circle. Everyone knew about Edward's public fight over Elizabeth. Seeing him now, it was obvious he still cared, and so they rushed to flatter him without hesitation.
""Mr. Ferguson, so you stepped out earlier to pick up Ms. Burton! After all these years, your bond is still strong!""
""Of course it is! They're childhood sweethearts. Just look at her. She's elegant and graceful. She and Mr. Ferguson make the perfect pair.""
As the crowd murmured approvingly, Esmeralda turned and saw Elizabeth walking in, arm linked with Edward's.
She wore a luxurious designer gown, her diamond necklace glittering under the chandelier. Her delicate features and poised demeanor exuded the kind of effortless refinement that only wealth could cultivate.
Even beside Edward's commanding presence, she stood her ground flawlessly.
A pang twisted in Esmeralda's chest. She suddenly remembered the faceless sketch Edward had once drawn after regaining his sight.
He'd said it was just something he'd drawn for fun. She hadn't thought much of it then, only that it was beautiful.
But now, seeing Elizabeth, she finally understood who the woman in that sketch had been.
It had never been about rekindling a lost love. He had never stopped loving her in the first place.
Lowering her gaze, Esmeralda turned to leave, but Elizabeth's voice rang out behind her.
""Ms. Wallace! I heard that it's your birthday today. I hope you don't mind me crashing the party. I brought you a gift.""
She motioned to someone, who led over a small, snow-white puppy on a leash.
""His name is Ralda. Isn't he adorable?""
The playful puppy bounded toward her, tail wagging. Esmeralda instinctively stumbled back, bumping into the table behind her.
Her face went pale, panic flickering in her eyes.
""Please take it away. I don't like dogs.""
Chapter 6
At her words, Elizabeth's smile faltered.
""Eddie, is Ms. Wallace still upset about what happened last time? Maybe I should go. I don't want to make things awkward.""
She turned to leave, but Edward quickly stopped her, frowning at Esmeralda.
""She meant well, Esme. Don't you love animals? Just take it.""
Seeing the faint irritation in his eyes, Esmeralda clenched her hands so tightly her nails dug into her palms. She turned toward Donovan instead.
""Mr. Nicholson, I'm wearing heels. Would you mind holding the dog for me?""
The people around her started whispering again, their tones dripping with mockery, saying she didn't know her place and loved to put on airs.
Edward seemed to think the same—that she was deliberately giving Elizabeth the cold shoulder—so he led her inside, his expression dark and unreadable.
Soon the hall emptied, and she was alone.
She poured herself a glass of water, trying to calm her trembling hands and the panic rising in her chest.
Once, she really had loved dogs.
But five years earlier, during a violent storm and blackout, Edward had fallen dangerously ill with a high fever. She'd run through the rain to find a doctor.
A neighbor's dog had chased her down the street and bitten into her leg, tearing away flesh.
She endured the pain until she was sure he was safe before getting her wound treated.
Since then, she had been terrified of dogs. But she never told him because she didn't want him to worry.
Even through the thin fabric of her dress, she could still feel the scar beneath her skin.
The guests, ever quick to take cues from power, now treated her with open disdain after seeing Edward's indifference.
When it came time for the celebration, everyone gathered around Elizabeth as if she were the one being honored.
When Edward's mood finally lightened, he called Esmeralda over to blow out the candles.
She walked over quietly, just as Elizabeth let out a delighted exclamation.
""Oh wow! What a coincidence! Ms. Wallace, the puppy shares your birthday. Why don't you two celebrate together?""
Laughter rippled through the crowd, muffled behind hands.
Esmeralda's nails bit deeper into her palms when she caught the taunting glint in Elizabeth's eyes.
She drew a slow breath and said coldly, ""In that case, let the puppy blow out the candles. Everyone can sing to it instead. I'll excuse myself.""
As she turned to leave, Edward's jaw tightened.
""Esme! This is your birthday party. What will others think if you walk out now?""
She ignored him and kept going.
Losing patience, Edward caught up to her, gripping her wrist and murmuring sharply in her ear before guiding her back to the cake.
""Be reasonable. Everyone here moves in the same circles. If you storm off now, the gossip will get back to my family, and they'll be even more against us.""
Against us? What us?
He had already married Elizabeth. What was there left for them to oppose?
All around her, the cheerful tune of ""Happy Birthday"" began to play.
Esmeralda's lips curved slightly, but her face was frozen like a statue carved from ice.
Someone suddenly picked up the puppy and placed it in her arms. Goosebumps prickled across her skin.
Midway through the song, the puppy squirmed free, leaping out of her hold.
It barreled straight into the towering champagne display. The tower collapsed toward Esmeralda and Elizabeth.
Screams erupted around the hall as glass shattered and liquid splashed everywhere.
Through the chaos, Esmeralda saw one clear image—Edward shielding Elizabeth with his body, pulling her out of harm's way.
The falling glass struck Esmeralda instead, slicing her shoulder open.
Blood streaked down her arm, staining her white dress crimson.
She collapsed to the floor with a stifled groan, cold sweat beading across her forehead.
Hearing the commotion, Edward turned around. Seeing her injured, he took a step forward, but then Elizabeth shrieked.
""Eddie! The puppy scratched me! What if it has rabies?""
He glanced at the faint red mark on her ankle, hesitated for a moment, then gave a curt order to Donovan.
""Take Esme to the hospital to treat her wounds.""
And with that, he left with Elizabeth.
The guests began to file out as well, each one tossing in a parting jab before they left.
""Ralda, Esmeralda—Ms. Wallace really does know how to pick a name, doesn't she? She's just like a stray dog that's lost its home.""
""Don't insult the puppy! Ralda's adorable—unlike certain mangy dogs who think they can climb too high.""
Every word cut deep, echoing painfully in Esmeralda's ears.
She looked down at her torn, bloodstained dress and the chaos around her. Her throat burned, her nose stung, and tears welled up uncontrollably.
The ""Happy Birthday"" sign above the cake came loose and fell, landing right at her feet.
She picked it up, staring at the empty, wrecked hall as the last of the guests disappeared. Finally, her tears fell freely.
Her 23rd birthday had ended in ruins.
Chapter 7
It was nearly dawn when Esmeralda finally dragged her exhausted body home.
The moment she turned on the lights, her phone buzzed several times.
It was a series of messages from Elizabeth.
""You've been liking all my posts lately, so I'm sure you already know that Eddie and I got our marriage certificate, right? He even promised me a wedding in the Maldives. I've seen the plans, and they're magnificent. Every single detail is just like what we dreamed of when we were young. I can't believe he still remembers after all these years.
""I really should thank you. If it weren't for you, he would still be blind. You took such good care of my husband for seven whole years. I owe you for that.""
The taunting words flashed across the screen, bold and unrestrained. Esmeralda didn't even have the strength to be angry anymore.
She set her phone aside, lay back on the bed, and drifted into a deep, heavy sleep.
That night, Edward still didn't come home. He only sent a short message.
""Esme, I still have some things to handle. Are your injuries bad? If they hurt too much, tell me and I'll come back right away.""
She stared at the message for a long time, her expression unreadable, before typing a single reply.
""Don't bother.""
She thought, ""Edward, from this moment on, I'll never need you anymore.""
When her shoulder wound finally scabbed over, Esmeralda went alone to the Ferguson's villa.
It was the place she and Edward had lived together when he was blind.
She picked up a shovel and walked to the old tree in the courtyard.
Beneath it was something they had buried on his 18th birthday—their ""shared wishes.""
She dug carefully until a small iron box appeared. The metal was rusted, the glass jar inside fogged with moisture.
She opened it, unfolded a star-shaped slip of paper, and saw her own handwriting.
""I hope Eddie can see the world again. I hope his life will be peaceful. I hope I can stay by his side forever.""
Every wish she had made was about him.
Some had come true.
Some never would.
She then unfolded the paper he had written.
""I wish to see again. I wish Eliza a lifetime of happiness.""
Every word was about him and Elizabeth, not her.
So he truly had never blamed Elizabeth for abandoning him. He had risked everything for her, suffered blindness for her, and had never once regretted it.
A bitter smile touched Esmeralda's lips. She tore up her own note and tossed the pieces down the drain. Then, she reached for the necklace around her neck.
It was the first gift he had ever bought her—with the money he earned from his very first deal after returning to the Ferguson family.
She had scolded him for spending so much, but he had just held her close, kissing her forehead with a smile.
""Esme, they say it's cold at the top, but as long as you're with me, I'll always have the strength to keep climbing. It's just a necklace. One day, everything I have, including me, will belong to you.""
Now, she buried that necklace, along with everything else that had ever tied her to him.
When the dirt was leveled, she turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, she ran into Edward and Elizabeth.
His expression flickered with surprise.
""Esme? What are you doing here?""
She looked at him calmly and asked, ""What about you? What are you doing here with her?""
Before he could answer, Elizabeth smiled sweetly and spoke first. ""It's been so long since I heard Eddie play the piano. He said the one he used is still here at the Ferguson's villa, so we came to pick it up. Ms. Wallace, you know this place best. Why don't you show us the way?""
Without waiting for permission, she linked her arm through Esmeralda's and started leading her toward the manor.",1,1763544594.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

""I can't believe you actually married the woman who dumped you back then. What about Esme? She's been so good to you. She loves you!"" his friend shouted.
""I'll stage a fake marriage with her later. She'll never find out."" Edward's voice was cold and impatient. ""You guys just need to keep my marriage to Eliza quiet, don’t let Esme know it.""
I swallowed back my tears. When Edward turned to look at me, I pretended I hadn't understood his Italian and forced a smile.
After he left, I took out my phone and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
\*\*\*
Inside the Maybach, Edward kissed Esmeralda Wallace until she was breathless.
Her clothes were stripped away, while Edward remained perfectly composed in his suit. The stark contrast between them made her cheeks flush with embarrassment.
He pulled her close, chuckling softly by her ear. ""The partition's up. The driver can't hear, and he wouldn't dare listen. What are you so shy about, hmm?""
The elegant man who had always been calm and distant was now rough and unrestrained. Esmeralda wrapped her arms around him, her eyes brimming with love. Just as the wave of pleasure was about to peak, a sudden ringtone shattered the moment.
Annoyed by the interruption, Edward frowned, but when he saw the caller ID, he still picked up.
Gasping for breath, Esmeralda glanced at the name. It was his closest friend, Owen Vazquez.
""Eddie, have you lost your mind—""
Edward's brows furrowed slightly. In flawless Italian, he cut Owen off mid-sentence. ""This isn't the right time. Speak in Italian.""
There was a pause, then Owen's voice came through in Italian, tense and disbelieving. ""You really married Elizabeth? What the hell are you thinking? She dumped you when you went blind trying to save her. She left you for another man and nearly drove you to ruin! And now you're taking her back?""
The words were foreign, but Esmeralda understood every one of them.
When she finally grasped their meaning, a chill swept through her as if she had been plunged into ice.
Edward, oblivious to her reaction, replied flatly, ""If I don't marry her, her family will force her to wed an old man. I can't let that happen.""
""What about Esmeralda? Back when you lost your sight, she was the only one who stayed by your side. She's loved you for years. She practically gave you her heart. All of us have seen it!""
Hearing the barely restrained anger in his voice, Edward remained composed. ""I'll handle it. She'll never find out.""
""How long are you going to hide it from her? Forever? She's been waiting for you to marry her!""
The more he listened, the more irritated Edward became; his voice quickened. ""Keep my marriage to Eliza quiet. Don't breathe a word. I'll stage a fake marriage with Esme later.""
After hanging up, he didn't bother listening to another word from Owen.
He dropped the phone, pushed it aside, and turned his full attention back to Esmeralda beneath him.
She trembled in his arms. Even after they were done and redressed, she couldn't stop shaking. Just as she was about to speak, his phone chimed again.
It was a message notification from a special contact.
He glanced at the screen, then called to the driver.
""Esme, something urgent came up at work. I'll drop you off here. Take a cab home, okay?""
She didn't say a word. She simply nodded in silence and opened the car door.
The black Maybach shot off down the road, leaving her alone on the curb.
Esmeralda's tears finally spilled over as she watched the traffic blur past.
No one knew that to get closer to Edward, Esmeralda had secretly learned Italian long ago.
So she understood every word he and Owen had exchanged.
Each sentence still echoed in her mind like a thousand sharp blades, piercing deep into her heart.
And with that shattering realization, the memories she had buried for years came flooding back.
Edward was the heir born into privilege, while she was only the daughter of a maid.
That year, she followed her mother into the Ferguson family's grand manor and saw him for the first time. He sat under a shaft of sunlight, playing the piano with effortless grace.
She had never heard such beautiful music, nor seen anyone so breathtakingly perfect.
From that single moment, the name Edward was carved deep into her heart.
She never told anyone about the boy she secretly loved.
It wasn't just because of the vast gulf between their worlds, but because she knew Edward already had someone he liked.
His childhood sweetheart's name was Elizabeth Burton.
He cherished her and protected her like a precious jewel.
At 17, he lost his sight in a car accident while saving her.
But after that, Elizabeth vanished from his life completely. She never visited the Ferguson's manor, never called, and soon appeared on someone else's arm.
The Fergusons had other kids, and his parents, always tied up with work, had little time to look after their now-blind son.
So Edward was sent to live alone in the Ferguson's villa.
And it was Esmeralda who volunteered to go there and care for him for seven long years.
When she was 23, she knelt outside a renowned doctor's home for three days and three nights before finally convincing him to come out of retirement and cure Edward's blindness.
The fallen star regained his brilliance.
Within a year, he reclaimed his position as the heir to the Ferguson Group.
Through winter and summer, it was she who stayed by his side. It was she who kept vigil from dusk till dawn. It was she who endured those seven bitter years with him.
She was the one who kissed him, who held him, who shared his bed.
But she never imagined that the first thing he would do after regaining power was to marry the very woman who had once abandoned him—Elizabeth.
For years, she had worked relentlessly to keep up with his pace, to be worthy of standing beside him.
But no matter how much she changed, his parents never accepted her. They kept thinking she wasn't good enough for their son and even tried to pay her to leave.
Every time, Edward fought with his family for her sake. And because of that, she never thought of leaving him.
But it wasn't until today.
Today, Esmeralda no longer wanted to stay by his side.
She wiped her tears away, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
Chapter 2
On the other end of the line, Georgia Ferguson's voice trembled with excitement.
""You finally came to your senses? Good. A maid's daughter like you was never worthy of my son—the heir to the Ferguson family. Where are you now? Come over right away. We'll sign the contract.""
Staring at the address Georgia sent moments later, Esmeralda gave a bitter, mocking smile and hailed a cab.
At the café, Georgia questioned her about everything.
Esmeralda answered each question calmly, and when she was done, Georgia's expression turned satisfied. She took out a document and slid it across the table.
""It's all in writing. Once you sign, I'll transfer half of the money to your account immediately. The remaining half will be sent the day you leave. You must promise that once you take the money, you'll never show your face in front of Eddie again. Ever. Do you understand?""
Esmeralda's eyelashes trembled as she looked at the astronomical compensation figure.
She would never show up again.
In this life or the next, she never wanted to see Edward again.
Without hesitation, she picked up the pen and signed her name cleanly and decisively.
Georgia finally relaxed, putting the contract away as she stood up. Before leaving, she gave one last reminder.
""I'm giving you two weeks. I don't care if you can change your identity or move abroad. Just make sure Eddie never sees you again.""
""I understand, Mrs. Ferguson. You have my word.""
After watching Georgia leave, Esmeralda went home.
Ensuring Edward would never see her again was simple.
The Ferguson family had a long military and political lineage—none of their descendants were allowed to emigrate.
All she had to do was move overseas, and Edward would never be able to reach her.
She spent most of the night researching immigration options and finally decided on Australia.
After making up her mind, she picked up her phone to check the time, only to notice a new post notification on her social feed.
When she opened the post, it was a nine-photo collage from Elizabeth.
The top row showed her holding a bouquet of roses, the middle displayed three marriage certificates, and the bottom showed intertwined hands with matching rings.
Esmeralda knew that since Edward wanted to keep his marriage a secret, he would never have allowed Elizabeth to post it.
But she still did, and she had even set the audience to ""visible only to Esmeralda."" A deliberate show of triumph.
Esmeralda smiled faintly and gave it a like.
The moment she exited the app, a message from Edward appeared.
""Esme, I'm going on a business trip. I won't be home for the next few days.""
She replied with a simple ""Okay,"" put down her phone, and went to wash up.
The next morning, she got up early to start her immigration paperwork.
Since she was in a hurry, she applied for the expedited process.
The clerk assured her it would be completed within two weeks, and only then did she finally breathe a sigh of relief.
Once she got in the car, she scrolled through Elizabeth's social feed again.
This time, half of Edward's figure appeared in the photo.
The two of them were holding hands, touring a new house, and in the end, they had settled on a villa in South Bay Estates.
Just like yesterday, Esmeralda hit the like button.
On the third day, she went to her company and handed in her resignation.
After packing up her things and returning home, she saw yet another update—Elizabeth in a wedding gown, the diamond on her ring finger sparkling brilliantly.
As always, Esmeralda gave it a like, then buried herself under the covers.
The fourth day came, and when she woke up, her feed had another update.
This time, the photo was of the framed wedding portrait hanging in the couple's new home.
Esmeralda stared at it for a long while before snapping out of it.
She liked the post again, then put on makeup and went out to have a farewell dinner with a few close friends.
That evening, she returned home carrying several boxes and began throwing away everything connected to Edward.
All the gifts he had given her, their matching toothbrushes and cups, the photos they had taken together—every trace of him went into the trash.
By the time she finished, it was past midnight.
She was about to turn off the lights when Edward suddenly came home.
He froze at the sight of the half-empty apartment, his brow furrowing.
""Why does it look like half the stuff in here is gone?""
""I didn't like them anymore, so I threw them out. We can always buy new ones later.""
Edward nodded, tossing his jacket onto the couch, but his gaze landed on the boxes stacked nearby.
""You quit your job?""
He paused, then noticed the Social Security card sitting on the coffee table.
""Why did you take that out?""
""I've been tired lately and need a break, so I resigned. The card is for some paperwork I need to handle.""
She answered calmly, packing her things as she spoke.
Seeing how composed she was, Edward didn't suspect anything. Pulling her into his arms, he spoke softly. ""I've been swamped these past few days and haven't had time for you. Your birthday's coming up in a few days. How about I take you to the auction house tomorrow and let you pick something you like?""
Esmeralda didn't refuse.
The next day, as soon as they took their seats in the grand hall, she spotted Elizabeth.
Elizabeth sauntered up confidently and sat down right beside Edward.
All night, Edward kept his attention solely on Esmeralda, never sparing a glance to the side.
When the auction ended, he didn't linger. He simply took her hand and led her downstairs.
Before heading home, Esmeralda stopped at the restroom.
When she came out, she saw Elizabeth cornered on the staircase by a group of arrogant young men. Their mocking laughter echoed through the hall.
""Well, well, isn't this Ms. Burton? The one who dumped Edward after he lost his sight. Looks like retribution finally caught up with you, huh?""
""I heard your father's marrying you off to some dying old man. You're still decent-looking, though. How about you come with us instead? We'd take good care of—""
The rest of his words were cut short.
Edward appeared at the top of the stairs, his expression dark as thunder. Without hesitation, he kicked the men aside with ruthless force.
Chapter 3
Then Edward grabbed the man who had been leading the group, pinned him to the ground, and punched him over and over, mercilessly. Blood splattered; the men cried out, begging for mercy.
""I'm sorry, Mr. Ferguson! Please forgive us and let us go!""
""Get lost! If I ever see you near her again, you'll deal with me personally!""
His furious roar sent the men scrambling away.
A crowd had gathered on the staircase, watching the scene unfold.
Edward ignored the stares and helped Elizabeth to her feet. ""Are you hurt?""
She fell into his arms, tears streaming down her face. ""My ankle hurts a lot.""
His expression darkened. Without hesitation, he scooped her up and pushed through the crowd, holding her close.
In the process of shielding her, his arm brushed hard against Esmeralda, knocking her backward.
Her head struck the sharp edge of a marble step with a sickening thud. Blood began to pour from the wound, making the onlookers gasp.
""She's bleeding! Someone call an ambulance!""
The pain was excruciating. Esmeralda's face twisted as cold sweat covered her skin.
Warm blood seeped between her fingers, dripping onto her eyelashes.
Through the haze, she saw Edward's back as he walked away without even turning around.
Once upon a time, when she had cut her finger while making soup for him, he had fussed for half a day. He insisted on calling a doctor as he was terrified it would scar.
She had teased him for overreacting, and he had lowered his head, kissed her hand, and said softly, ""Esme, you're the person I hold closest to my heart. When you get hurt, it hurts me more. Things are getting better now. You don't need to do all this yourself anymore. You will still have to wear the ring I'm going to give you. It wouldn't look right with a scar.""
Now she was bleeding in front of him, and he didn't even glance her way.
And that ring he had once promised her? It now glittered on another woman's hand.
The ambulance took Esmeralda to the hospital.
She registered herself, saw the doctor, picked up her medication, and went home alone. It was long past midnight when she was done.
That night, the pain kept her awake. She tossed and turned until dawn.
Edward never came home.
The next morning, she dragged her aching body out of bed to change her dressing and saw a new post from Elizabeth.
It was a video of Edward kneeling on one knee, gently massaging her ankle, and applying medicine.
Esmeralda watched it over and over, her eyes reddening before she eventually drifted into a restless sleep.
When she woke, the sky outside was already dark.
Her phone buzzed nonstop beside the pillow. She answered, and Edward's voice came through.
""Come to private room 703 at The Pavilion now.""
Esmeralda hesitated for a moment before getting out of bed.
After washing up, she quickly headed out.
When she pushed open the door, the first person she saw was Elizabeth.
Her eyes were red, her expression pitiful as if she were a fragile little rabbit.
Edward sat across from her, his face unreadable, the air around him heavy with tension.
Silence hung thick in the room until Esmeralda finally spoke.
""Why did you ask me to come here?""
Edward straightened in his seat, clasping his hands together with the poise of someone used to being in control.
""Esme, did you send those men from last night to harass her?""
Esmeralda froze.
Her eyes flicked to Elizabeth, catching the faint glimmer of satisfaction flashing in them.
In that instant, she understood everything. This was all Elizabeth's doing.
She gave a weary, ironic smile. ""No. I don't know those people, and I wouldn't waste my time doing something like that.""
Her calm explanation didn't change the darkness on Edward's face.
He lowered his gaze, his voice even but cold. ""Esme, when Elizabeth left me years ago, I let her go completely. You've been with me for seven years. You should know who's in my heart now. The Burton family has fallen on hard times, and everyone's eager to kick them while they are down. But you shouldn't be one of them. You don't need to make things harder for her because of me.""
His words hit her like a blade twisting deep inside.
Memories of him breaking down in the middle of the night, chasing after doctors, fighting for his sight, and the hopeless diagnosis that he would never see again flooded her mind.
The man, who was born with every advantage, had lost his sight completely for the sake of one girl.
Seven years of devotion, gone with a few indifferent words, as if they'd meant nothing.
She thought of the marriage certificate stamped with both his and Elizabeth's names. Her eyes burned with tears. ""You're right. We've been together seven years, and I'm only now realizing who you truly have in your heart.""
Edward frowned. ""What do you mean by that?""
Esmeralda shook her head with a bitter smile. ""I mean, I'm just a maid's daughter. Do you really think I'd have the money or the connections to hire people like that to humiliate an heiress?""
Even with her words laid bare, he still didn't believe her.
She was too tired to explain any further.
She took a deep breath and asked softly, ""If you don't believe me, just tell me what you want me to do.""
Edward rubbed his temple. ""Apologize. Esme, when you've done something wrong, you should say you're sorry.""
At that moment, Elizabeth, who had been sitting meekly to the side, finally spoke up in a soft, trembling voice.
""No need to apologize. If you truly feel sorry, drink these.""
Chapter 4
The table was lined with glasses of amber-colored whiskey.
Esmeralda's gaze lifted to Edward, searching his face for a clear answer.
But the lighting was dim, and his expression was unreadable in the shadows.
The silence was suffocating; every breath felt like it was draining the air from her lungs.
Her breathing quickened, and a flood of memories surged through her mind.
When she first moved into the Ferguson's villa, Edward, who was blind and bitter, had drowned himself in alcohol every night.
Worried about his health, she had tried to stop him, again and again, but he never listened.
One night, drunk beyond reason, he had sneered at her and pushed several bottles toward her.
""Even a maid's daughter dares to lecture me now? I really have fallen low. Fine. If you drink these, I'll do as you say.""
She had wanted to tell him that she wasn't trying to control him and that she was just worried.
But instead, despite being allergic to alcohol, she had picked up the bottle and drank without hesitation.
Minutes later, she was rushed to the hospital.
When she woke, he was sitting by her bed, his face dark and cold. ""I'm the one who was drunk, not you. You knew you were allergic, so why would you risk your life like that?""
She had only whispered, ""Because I care about you, Mr. Ferguson. Your eyes will heal someday. And even if they don't, I'll still stay with you. So please, don't give up.""
From that day on, Edward quit drinking.
For years after, there wasn't a single bottle of alcohol in the house.
Thinking of that now, Esmeralda smiled faintly, though her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.
Without explaining herself, she reached for the small packet of chili powder beside her and emptied it into one of the glasses. Her tone was steady, final.
""These few glasses hardly prove anything, do they? I'll take this as punishment. Will that be enough for you?""
Before anyone could react, she lifted a glass and drank it down, one after another.
The burning bitterness spread from her tongue down her throat, searing its way through her chest, stomach, and heart—everywhere he'd once lived inside her.
By the seventh glass, Edward finally lost his composure.
""That's enough!""
Esmeralda looked at the untouched glasses left on the table and let out a hollow laugh.
""Enough? So that means I've apologized properly? Have I pleased the woman you love now?""
At that, Edward stood up abruptly and grabbed her wrist.
His usually emotionless face was dark with fury.
""You know that's not what I meant! Esme, I told you that there's nothing between me and Elizabeth anymore. My family doesn't want you marrying into the Ferguson family, and if you keep acting like this, they'll use it against you. I just don't want you to get hurt or be talked about!""
His words sounded righteous, even protective.
But to Esmeralda, they were nothing but excuses.
If the Ferguson family couldn't accept a maid's daughter like her, how could they possibly accept Elizabeth—the woman who had abandoned him?
And yet, despite everything, he had still married her.
Because when it came to love, he had always chosen her.
Esmeralda no longer wanted to argue. She yanked her hand free and turned toward the door.
But before she could take two steps, her body swayed, and everything went black.
""Esme!""
Edward's heart stopped. He lunged forward, catching her before she hit the ground.
As he lifted her into his arms, Elizabeth's trembling voice rose behind him. ""Eddie, I feel dizzy...""
He froze for a second—but only a second.
Then he strode out without looking back.
""I'm taking Esme to the hospital. Call your assistant to take care of you.""
When Esmeralda opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital ward.
Edward, who hadn't slept all night, finally exhaled when he saw her open her eyes.
Their gazes met and lingered for a long time, neither of them saying a word.
He finally poured her a glass of warm water, tucked the blanket around her, then called the doctor to run another check and carefully noted every instruction.
He even canceled all his meetings, despite Donovan Nicholson waiting anxiously outside the door.
Watching that, Esmeralda finally spoke. ""You should go to work. I can take care of myself. This isn't something you need to do.""
His hand paused mid-motion, his voice soft but heavy. ""I should do it, Esme. Don't you remember? You were the one who used to take care of me like this.""
A flicker of confusion crossed her eyes.
Back then, when he had lost his sight and been cast aside by his family, she had stayed.
She had learned Braille to teach him, helped him read, took him for walks in the sun, and cooked all his favorite dishes.
It felt as if she had stolen a piece of the moon for herself. The once-dim world around her was filled with light.
Those seven years had been the happiest of her life.
But the moon was never hers. Now, she couldn't go back.
That afternoon, the doctor escorted her to the examination room.
Half an hour later, a nurse helped her back to her ward.
As she pushed the door open, she saw Edward holding her phone, his brow furrowed and his voice cold as he spoke to Georgia.
""I've told you before that Esme and I love each other. I don't care about her background. You can stop interfering. I'm going to marry her, and she's not leaving me.""
Hearing the sound, he looked up at her, and a moment later, Georgia's puzzled voice came through the phone.
""What do you mean she's not leaving? Didn't you know? Esmeralda already agreed to leave the country a few days ago...""
Chapter 5
The conversation on the phone cut off abruptly.
Esmeralda stumbled forward on unsteady feet, snatched her phone from Edward's hand, and ended the call.
Startled, he stared at her, unable to understand why she looked so shaken.
""What's wrong?""
Seeing his confused expression, she realized he hadn't heard what Georgia said at the end.
She breathed a sigh of relief. She looked away and forced her voice to stay calm. ""It's nothing. I just don't want you arguing with your family over me anymore.""
The Ferguson family had been in constant turmoil over their relationship, doing everything they could to break them apart. He had fought with them more than once because of her.
Her words soothed him enough that he didn't press further. Instead, he asked about her test results.
""The doctor said it's nothing serious. I can be discharged.""
In the days after they returned home, Edward barely went out at all. He stayed by Esmeralda's side the entire time.
But she was no longer the cheerful, lively woman she once was. She often sat in the corner in silence, staring into nothing, her spirit dimmed.
He couldn't figure out what was wrong. When he tried to hold her and comfort her, she quietly stood up and said, ""I don't feel well. I'm going to rest for a bit.""
Her distance caught him off guard.
He assumed she was still upset about what had happened that night, so he decided to surprise her.
For her birthday, he organized a grand celebration.
Out of respect for Edward, nearly everyone in his circle attended.
In his presence, they were polite to Esmeralda.
But the moment he stepped away, their words turned sharp and cruel.
""If it weren't for Mr. Ferguson, I'd never come to a maid's daughter's birthday party. Just being here feels beneath me.""
""I can't imagine what he sees in her. She reeks of cheapness and small-town air.""
""Mr. Ferguson's loyal, I'll give him that. But if it were me, I'd pay her off and be done with it. Marrying her would disgrace the entire Ferguson family!""
Even though she was the guest of honor, Esmeralda stood alone at the party, unnoticed and forgotten.
Their whispered insults pricked at her from every direction, and exhaustion pressed down on her like a weight.
If not for the fear of making Edward suspicious, she would never have come.
Every minute of that evening felt unbearable.
Around 7:00 p.m., the atmosphere suddenly shifted.
All at once, the guests turned toward the entrance. The disdain on their faces vanished, replaced by eager smiles.
News traveled fast in their circle. Everyone knew about Edward's public fight over Elizabeth. Seeing him now, it was obvious he still cared, and so they rushed to flatter him without hesitation.
""Mr. Ferguson, so you stepped out earlier to pick up Ms. Burton! After all these years, your bond is still strong!""
""Of course it is! They're childhood sweethearts. Just look at her. She's elegant and graceful. She and Mr. Ferguson make the perfect pair.""
As the crowd murmured approvingly, Esmeralda turned and saw Elizabeth walking in, arm linked with Edward's.
She wore a luxurious designer gown, her diamond necklace glittering under the chandelier. Her delicate features and poised demeanor exuded the kind of effortless refinement that only wealth could cultivate.
Even beside Edward's commanding presence, she stood her ground flawlessly.
A pang twisted in Esmeralda's chest. She suddenly remembered the faceless sketch Edward had once drawn after regaining his sight.
He'd said it was just something he'd drawn for fun. She hadn't thought much of it then, only that it was beautiful.
But now, seeing Elizabeth, she finally understood who the woman in that sketch had been.
It had never been about rekindling a lost love. He had never stopped loving her in the first place.
Lowering her gaze, Esmeralda turned to leave, but Elizabeth's voice rang out behind her.
""Ms. Wallace! I heard that it's your birthday today. I hope you don't mind me crashing the party. I brought you a gift.""
She motioned to someone, who led over a small, snow-white puppy on a leash.
""His name is Ralda. Isn't he adorable?""
The playful puppy bounded toward her, tail wagging. Esmeralda instinctively stumbled back, bumping into the table behind her.
Her face went pale, panic flickering in her eyes.
""Please take it away. I don't like dogs.""
Chapter 6
At her words, Elizabeth's smile faltered.
""Eddie, is Ms. Wallace still upset about what happened last time? Maybe I should go. I don't want to make things awkward.""
She turned to leave, but Edward quickly stopped her, frowning at Esmeralda.
""She meant well, Esme. Don't you love animals? Just take it.""
Seeing the faint irritation in his eyes, Esmeralda clenched her hands so tightly her nails dug into her palms. She turned toward Donovan instead.
""Mr. Nicholson, I'm wearing heels. Would you mind holding the dog for me?""
The people around her started whispering again, their tones dripping with mockery, saying she didn't know her place and loved to put on airs.
Edward seemed to think the same—that she was deliberately giving Elizabeth the cold shoulder—so he led her inside, his expression dark and unreadable.
Soon the hall emptied, and she was alone.
She poured herself a glass of water, trying to calm her trembling hands and the panic rising in her chest.
Once, she really had loved dogs.
But five years earlier, during a violent storm and blackout, Edward had fallen dangerously ill with a high fever. She'd run through the rain to find a doctor.
A neighbor's dog had chased her down the street and bitten into her leg, tearing away flesh.
She endured the pain until she was sure he was safe before getting her wound treated.
Since then, she had been terrified of dogs. But she never told him because she didn't want him to worry.
Even through the thin fabric of her dress, she could still feel the scar beneath her skin.
The guests, ever quick to take cues from power, now treated her with open disdain after seeing Edward's indifference.
When it came time for the celebration, everyone gathered around Elizabeth as if she were the one being honored.
When Edward's mood finally lightened, he called Esmeralda over to blow out the candles.
She walked over quietly, just as Elizabeth let out a delighted exclamation.
""Oh wow! What a coincidence! Ms. Wallace, the puppy shares your birthday. Why don't you two celebrate together?""
Laughter rippled through the crowd, muffled behind hands.
Esmeralda's nails bit deeper into her palms when she caught the taunting glint in Elizabeth's eyes.
She drew a slow breath and said coldly, ""In that case, let the puppy blow out the candles. Everyone can sing to it instead. I'll excuse myself.""
As she turned to leave, Edward's jaw tightened.
""Esme! This is your birthday party. What will others think if you walk out now?""
She ignored him and kept going.
Losing patience, Edward caught up to her, gripping her wrist and murmuring sharply in her ear before guiding her back to the cake.
""Be reasonable. Everyone here moves in the same circles. If you storm off now, the gossip will get back to my family, and they'll be even more against us.""
Against us? What us?
He had already married Elizabeth. What was there left for them to oppose?
All around her, the cheerful tune of ""Happy Birthday"" began to play.
Esmeralda's lips curved slightly, but her face was frozen like a statue carved from ice.
Someone suddenly picked up the puppy and placed it in her arms. Goosebumps prickled across her skin.
Midway through the song, the puppy squirmed free, leaping out of her hold.
It barreled straight into the towering champagne display. The tower collapsed toward Esmeralda and Elizabeth.
Screams erupted around the hall as glass shattered and liquid splashed everywhere.
Through the chaos, Esmeralda saw one clear image—Edward shielding Elizabeth with his body, pulling her out of harm's way.
The falling glass struck Esmeralda instead, slicing her shoulder open.
Blood streaked down her arm, staining her white dress crimson.
She collapsed to the floor with a stifled groan, cold sweat beading across her forehead.
Hearing the commotion, Edward turned around. Seeing her injured, he took a step forward, but then Elizabeth shrieked.
""Eddie! The puppy scratched me! What if it has rabies?""
He glanced at the faint red mark on her ankle, hesitated for a moment, then gave a curt order to Donovan.
""Take Esme to the hospital to treat her wounds.""
And with that, he left with Elizabeth.
The guests began to file out as well, each one tossing in a parting jab before they left.
""Ralda, Esmeralda—Ms. Wallace really does know how to pick a name, doesn't she? She's just like a stray dog that's lost its home.""
""Don't insult the puppy! Ralda's adorable—unlike certain mangy dogs who think they can climb too high.""
Every word cut deep, echoing painfully in Esmeralda's ears.
She looked down at her torn, bloodstained dress and the chaos around her. Her throat burned, her nose stung, and tears welled up uncontrollably.
The ""Happy Birthday"" sign above the cake came loose and fell, landing right at her feet.
She picked it up, staring at the empty, wrecked hall as the last of the guests disappeared. Finally, her tears fell freely.
Her 23rd birthday had ended in ruins.
Chapter 7
It was nearly dawn when Esmeralda finally dragged her exhausted body home.
The moment she turned on the lights, her phone buzzed several times.
It was a series of messages from Elizabeth.
""You've been liking all my posts lately, so I'm sure you already know that Eddie and I got our marriage certificate, right? He even promised me a wedding in the Maldives. I've seen the plans, and they're magnificent. Every single detail is just like what we dreamed of when we were young. I can't believe he still remembers after all these years.
""I really should thank you. If it weren't for you, he would still be blind. You took such good care of my husband for seven whole years. I owe you for that.""
The taunting words flashed across the screen, bold and unrestrained. Esmeralda didn't even have the strength to be angry anymore.
She set her phone aside, lay back on the bed, and drifted into a deep, heavy sleep.
That night, Edward still didn't come home. He only sent a short message.
""Esme, I still have some things to handle. Are your injuries bad? If they hurt too much, tell me and I'll come back right away.""
She stared at the message for a long time, her expression unreadable, before typing a single reply.
""Don't bother.""
She thought, ""Edward, from this moment on, I'll never need you anymore.""
When her shoulder wound finally scabbed over, Esmeralda went alone to the Ferguson's villa.
It was the place she and Edward had lived together when he was blind.
She picked up a shovel and walked to the old tree in the courtyard.
Beneath it was something they had buried on his 18th birthday—their ""shared wishes.""
She dug carefully until a small iron box appeared. The metal was rusted, the glass jar inside fogged with moisture.
She opened it, unfolded a star-shaped slip of paper, and saw her own handwriting.
""I hope Eddie can see the world again. I hope his life will be peaceful. I hope I can stay by his side forever.""
Every wish she had made was about him.
Some had come true.
Some never would.
She then unfolded the paper he had written.
""I wish to see again. I wish Eliza a lifetime of happiness.""
Every word was about him and Elizabeth, not her.
So he truly had never blamed Elizabeth for abandoning him. He had risked everything for her, suffered blindness for her, and had never once regretted it.
A bitter smile touched Esmeralda's lips. She tore up her own note and tossed the pieces down the drain. Then, she reached for the necklace around her neck.
It was the first gift he had ever bought her—with the money he earned from his very first deal after returning to the Ferguson family.
She had scolded him for spending so much, but he had just held her close, kissing her forehead with a smile.
""Esme, they say it's cold at the top, but as long as you're with me, I'll always have the strength to keep climbing. It's just a necklace. One day, everything I have, including me, will belong to you.""
Now, she buried that necklace, along with everything else that had ever tied her to him.
When the dirt was leveled, she turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, she ran into Edward and Elizabeth.
His expression flickered with surprise.
""Esme? What are you doing here?""
She looked at him calmly and asked, ""What about you? What are you doing here with her?""
Before he could answer, Elizabeth smiled sweetly and spoke first. ""It's been so long since I heard Eddie play the piano. He said the one he used is still here at the Ferguson's villa, so we came to pick it up. Ms. Wallace, you know this place best. Why don't you show us the way?""
Without waiting for permission, she linked her arm through Esmeralda's and started leading her toward the manor.

1p130dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Short_Stories/comments/1p130dg/a_corporate_story/,A Corporate Story,"I’ve seen it all.

I wish I could say that about life - that I’ve travelled so much the airport staff greet me by name, that I’ve walked through places my knees will never forgive me for, that I’ve met people stranger than my own family gatherings, or stood in landscapes I assumed were made up by novelists.

But no.
None of that.

What I have seen - deeply, repeatedly, sometimes against my will - is the corporate world.

Day 1: Everyone is so fucking nice.

You show up in your best professional outfit, pretending you didn’t spend half the morning panicking about whether the blazer makes you look “capable” or “trying too hard.” You take yourself seriously. You walk in full of hope, confidence, and the kind of optimism that only someone who hasn’t met the real characters of the organisation can have.

And you don’t even have to say much.
You’re the new one.
People smile at you like you’re a shiny new gadget they haven’t figured out how to break yet.
A quick, boring office tour with your manager — if you’re lucky enough to have them on your first day. Otherwise it’s whoever got voluntold to “look after the new starter” and will now be unofficially blamed for all your future mishaps for the next six months.

“This is the kitchen… this is the fridge… put name tags on your food or people will steal it hahaha…”

They always laugh.
It’s never actually funny.

“This is the toilet… "" wow, fancy… and here’s a very advanced, very fucking annoying tap that only works if you perform a ritual dance in front of the sensor.

“This is the emergency exit… "" no one will use it anyway because people completely lose their brains during an actual emergency.

""And this is us. CE - the Culture Enforcement team.”

She said it casually, like it wasn’t the most dystopian-sounding shit I’d ever heard.

Like every company has a group dedicated to policing your tone of voice and making sure you smile in the ‘right’ way in meetings.

But I knew. I always knew. That's my team. The CE Team. 

The CE Team sat in a little glass fishbowl of an area, typing furiously, as if culture might collapse if they didn’t beat it into shape before lunch.

One team member was frowning at a spreadsheet titled ‘Emotional Engagement Compliance – Q3’.

Another was rehearsing lines from the “Values Conversation Guide” like she was prepping for a hostage negotiation.

Someone else was intensely debating whether “authenticity” should be measured quarterly or monthly.

Then I passed by someone who looked like they are up in the hierarchy.. looked up and gave me a smile so forced it could’ve been classified as workplace harassment - could be our director.. except it probably wasn’t her.

Because no one actually sees her.

The CE Team director is more of a rumour than a person. A corporate myth.

People swear she exists, but only in the same way people swear they’ve seen a smiling coworker on a Monday or a functional printer in the office.

Before I could make sense of it, she vanished - slipped into a meeting, or a Teams call, or another dimension. Hard to tell with directors.

On the wall behind the empty director’s chair hung a massive pastel poster:

WE DON’T JUST MANAGE CULTURE. WE ENGINEER IT.

Ironically, the person in charge of engineering it was never around to witness any of it.

Day 2: The Office Bitch (es)

By Day 2, the sparkle of being “the new starter” has worn off, and so has everyone’s customer-service smile.
This is when you start identifying the ecosystem - the real food chain of the office.
And at the very top, somehow thriving in recycled air and passive-aggressive emails, and vocal fry, sit the Office Bitches.

Not gendered.
Not age-specific.
Not role-specific.

Just a universal species that evolves in every corporate environment, like mould in damp bathrooms.

You don’t find them.
They reveal themselves - usually by lunchtime.

There’s the Hierarchy Bitch, who only speaks to you if your title includes a minimum of two capitalised words.

There’s the “I’m soooo busy, I don’t have time for anything” Bitch - the one who weaponises her calendar like it’s a personality trait.

She moves through the office like a martyr returning from war, sighing loudly enough for CE to file a noise complaint.
Every conversation with her starts with:

“Sorry, I’m just so busy.”
“I literally have zero time.”
“I’m drowning.”
“Today is insane.”
“Honestly, I shouldn’t even be talking right now.”

Her Outlook calendar is a graveyard of fake meetings titled “Focus Time” or “Strategic Priority Deep Dive,” which translates to drinking a coffee in silence and avoiding people.

She walks fast, carries a laptop everywhere (even when she’s not using it), and somehow still manages to accomplish absolutely nothing visible to the human eye.

But she’ll make you feel guilty for existing near her workload - especially if you’re new.
Because nothing threatens a Busy Bitch more than someone who hasn’t yet accepted burnout as a lifestyle.

Even if you gently express concern - something like, “Are you okay? You look like you haven’t slept in a month…” - she’ll snap upright with the offended pride of someone who considers exhaustion a competitive sport.

“I’m fine,” she’ll insist, eyes twitching, voice trembling, clutching her reusable coffee cup like a life-support device.

“This is just how things are when you’re as busy as I am.”

Translation:
How dare you notice the consequences of my terrible choices and lack of boundaries.


The Reply-All Bitch who sends emails so aggressive they could qualify as workplace violence.

There’s the “I just don’t like your face” Bitch - the one who looks annoyed the moment you enter the room, as if your very existence is a personal inconvenience.

You haven’t said a word. You haven’t done a thing.

You simply are, and that’s already too much for her.

She doesn’t hide it either.

Her eyes do that quick up-down scan, her jaw tightens, and you can almost hear the internal monologue: “Ugh. This one.”

You don’t know why.
You’ll never know why.

But congratulations - you’ve offended her by breathing.

And of course, the I-Know-Everything-And-I’ll-Let-You-Die-Before-I-Help Bitch - a classic.

Then there’s the Office Admin - not technically a bitch, but bitterness has done half the job for her.

She’ll tell you she “almost joined the CE Team once,” in that tone people use when they say they almost won a medal at the Olympics.

Depending on who you ask, she didn’t make it because she was too lazy… or too stupid… or because she thought the job “wasn’t worth it.”

And now here she is:
stuck doing the boring admin everyone relies on but no one appreciates, earning less than the CE cunts who “engineer culture” from their pastel meeting rooms.

“I mean, what do they even do anyway?”
She says that a lot. Loudly.

Mostly when she thinks no one from CE is listening.

She’s not a bitch by nature - she’s just become one selectively.
Especially when new, young, fresh-faced starters show up.

Her favourite demographic for projecting the life she didn’t choose but now deeply resents.

They don’t bother hiding.
They don’t need to.

By Day 2, they’ve already sniffed you out like sharks detecting a drop of blood in a sea of corporate bullshit.

Day 3: CE INDUCTION HANDBOOK

""Here is your induction handbook.. let me know if you have any questions!..""


Welcome to CE — Culture Enforcement.
You are now part of the organisation’s most essential, most misunderstood, and most performatively important department.
Please read the following carefully. Compliance is not optional.
Neither are feelings.

⸻

1. OUR PURPOSE

CE exists to ensure that all employees demonstrate a consistent level of:
	•	emotional alignment
	•	behavioural compliance
	•	corporate enthusiasm
	•	and general workplace “vibe cohesion”

We do not fix problems.
We fix perceptions.

⸻

2. YOUR ROLE

As a CE team member, you must:
	•	Monitor the emotional atmosphere of all office spaces
	•	Identify mood deviations (frowning, sighing, neutral expressions)
	•	Offer corrective interventions (“smile more,” “try gratitude,” “remember the values”)
	•	Record all behavioural misalignments in the Culture Dashboard
	•	Pretend the dashboard means something

You are not responsible for solving workplace issues.
Only for ensuring employees feel the approved way about them.

⸻

3. ACCEPTABLE FEELINGS

Employees may experience:
	•	optimism
	•	gratitude
	•	resilience
	•	“growth-oriented discomfort”
	•	enthusiasm (minimum 3/10, maximum 6/10)

Unacceptable feelings include:
	•	frustration
	•	cynicism
	•	confusion
	•	burnout (unless framed positively)
	•	“not today” energy
	•	existential dread (even if justified)

If encountered, these must be rebranded as “learning opportunities.”

⸻

4. CULTURE BREACHES

A Culture Breach occurs when an employee:
	•	sighs too loudly
	•	frowns longer than four seconds
	•	rolls their eyes above a 30° angle
	•	says, “I don’t care”
	•	questions CE’s purpose
	•	recognises the CE director in the hallway (rare, but possible)

All breaches must be logged, colour-coded, and ignored.

⸻

5. THE CE DIRECTOR

The CE Director is your guiding light.
It is unlikely you will ever see her.
If you do, report the sighting to your team immediately — sightings are used for long-term statistical modelling and annual goal-setting.

Do not attempt direct communication.
She has meetings in multiple dimensions.

⸻

6. MEETING ETIQUETTE

During CE meetings:
	•	nod often
	•	smile when appropriate
	•	avoid facial expressions that imply understanding
	•	use at least one buzzword per sentence
	•	feign excitement when tasks are described as “quick wins” or “strategic touchpoints”

Never ask for clarification.
It implies you have not absorbed the culture.
⸻

7. REMEMBER

You are no longer here to work.
You are here to shape the narrative of work.

Culture isn’t just important -
it’s the only metric that matters now.

Welcome aboard.
Or at least… welcome emotionally.

1p12y3n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p12y3n,"Leche Flan: Its History, and Its Presence in Old Philippine Cookbooks","Oh, sweet and glorious, this Filipino leche flan (Image 1) whose thickness, if not savored properly, could choke the most ignorant of people, whose color scheme, if perfect, is awe inspiring despite it being shades of steamed yolk and sugar, whose texture, if perfect, is as smooth as the water you will drink after savoring its sweetness and creaminess, whose oval shape can be considered its own shape. The quintessential dessert in Philippine celebrations: fiestas (Image 2), weddings, baptisms, debuts, birthday parties, and the like. Just don’t serve it with soy sauce (Image 3).

This leche flan is indeed a guilty pleasure for many Filipinos as it is not traditionally served everyday. It is also used as a topping for the usual halo-halo months mostly in the summer but now commercially in every major halo-halo store in the country. After celebrating fiesta and bringing some home, I admit to hounding one a day, indeed not a food for dieting. The llanera (Image 4), the container in which the leche flan comes from, would either be returned or kept looking at the patterns from the metal’s first use in the printing industry. Interestingly, in Pampanga cuisine, it has grated ‘dayap’ (key lime) as a topping and is steamed in a covered container (bain-marie) with counterweights (Image 5). It is uncertain if the first leche flan is from Pampanga, though it is certain that it was served there during the late Spanish period.

With that, here is the history of leche flan: from its ancient Roman ancestor to its modern Filipino convention.

The ancient Romans had a dish called tyropatina (Image 6) found in the 7th book of De Re Coquinaria^(1). The word tyropatina comes from the tyros, a Greek term meaning cheese, and patina, referring to both the cooking pan or plate and the dish made there^(1).

Eventually, dishes of this kind spread around the Roman Empire although records of flans would only return during the Medieval Ages such as the Iberian peninsula where they were called ‘flaones’^(2). 

In his 1283 novel ‘Romanç d'Evast e Blaquerna’, Ramón Llull mentioned “el flaó” as a delicacy that is capable of raising greedy children^(2). In the 1350 Carta Cibariorium, also known as the ‘libro de yantares de la canónica de Santa María de Tortosa’, all the monks received ‘un flaón’ on the Saturdays of Septuagesima (“the ninth Sunday before Easter, the third before Lent”^(3)) and Advent^(2). Depending on the weight, there are three kinds of flaón^(2).

At the end of the 14th century, in the third part of Lo Crestiá, a Catalan encyclopedia, Francesc Eiximenis included “flaons e formajades e formatge frit ab mantega” where he discusses the temptations Christian men face, hence deriving that its deliciousness allow for it to be both a festive food and an object of sin^(2). In 1520, the first preserved copy of ‘Llibre del Coch’ by El Mestre Robert o Ruperto de Nola, then-chef to King Ferdinand I of Naples (1424-1494), mentions flaó with the ingredient of mint^(2). Five years later, the Castilian Spanish translation mentions them under “flaones q̃s (que es) fruta de sartén” (Image 7) made with requesón (ricotta cheese), fresh cheese, mint, rose water, high quality wheat flour and canesú (unsure what this is, probably cane sugar)^(2).

In 1611, then-chef to Philip III of Spain, Francisco Martínez Montiño, in his cookbook 'Arte de cozina, pasteleria, vizcocheria y conserveria' mentions of numerous dairy desserts such as “pasteles flaones” and “otros flaones” (Image 8) using a greased mold^(2). The latter is under the category of the flans, including leche flan. In 1732, the Diccionario de la lengua castellana describes the ‘flaon’ as follows:

>FLAON. f. m. Plato regalado que se hace con hiemas de huevos, azucar molido, leche y harina, tostado todo por encima, el qual se forma en un vaso de masa o en un plato untado con manteca de vacas, con lumbre debaxo y encima para que se cuaje y tueste. Montiñ. Art. de Cocin. f. 175. y 176. Lat. *Placenta lactea saccharo ovisque confecta*.\^4

Interestingly, this definition mentions Francisco Martínez Montiño and his cookbook Arte de cozina, then already called art de cocina by then. 

In 1831, there was the first written mention of the term ‘flan’ in Spain. In 1843, the dictionary of Real Academia Española (Royal Spanish Academy) first included the term “flan” as another term for flaon as follows: 

>FLAN. m. FLAON.\^5

>FLAON. m. Especie de manjar compuesto de harina, leche, huevos y azúcar, todo cuajado y tostado por todas partes. *Placenta lactea saccharo ovisque confecta.*\^5

The fact that the same Latin phrase is shown further cements Montiño as the stepping stone in the shaping of the Spanish flan. 

Then, in 1846, Ramón Joaquín Domínguez wrote on the flan in his dictionary ‘Diccionario Nacional’:

>**Flan.** s. m. Especie de crema tostada, en figura de torta ú objeto análogo, ó bien en forma de cubilete etc. Es una preparacion ó combinacion dulcemente artística que se hace con huevos, leche, manteca, azúcar y canela. || V. FLAON\^6

This is certainly a predecessor of what would become the Filipino leche flan.

With that, it is uncertain how the Spanish flan came to the Philippines. One could be that it came via Mexico during the galleon trade with nothing changed given the base ingredients. Another is that it came after the galleon trade directly via Spain. What is certain is that it is a Spanish influence that came due to the building of churches. This is strengthened by the fact that there is no known Spanish-Filipino language dictionary during the Spanish colonial period which showcases that the dish was not eaten by the natives during this period.

In order for the Spanish missionaries to spread the Catholic faith, many churches were built to accommodate their converts. At first, the Spaniards utilized argamasa (mortar in English) which is a mixture of sand (as salt-free as possible), lime (cal) and water which would later be made more durable using egg whites, molasses, and plants^(7). Given the number and size of the churches built, it is estimated to have used millions of eggs, mostly duck eggs^(7). 

Indeed, Professor Ricardo Jose, on his essay ‘Palitada: Skin of the Church’ writes that: ""As early as 1780, duck eggs were combined with lime, powdered brick and *miel de cana* \[syrup \[specifically molasses\]\] \[Regalado Trota Jose states that the last ingredient is bamboo sap^(7) rather than *miel de cana*\] to seal the dome of the Manila Cathedral, a curious mix which was however well-tested through time""^(8). He furthermore writes that ""Eggs were used for the church at Bacoor, Cavite in 1808; in 1824, the parish priest of the same church, Padre Mariano Gomez, entered the expenses for duck eggs used in the mortar.""^(8)

Originally, the yolks would simply be disposed of as they have no known use. With that, there is oral tradition that some women, most likely Spaniards or mestiza, at the church found the disposing of leftover yolks to be wasteful so they began to use them in their cooking especially in desserts, one of which being leche flan^(8). Indeed, this dish was certainly taught to the Filipinos by the Spaniards^(9). Given the use of duck egg yolks, the flan would have been much thicker than that of the leche flan with its chicken egg yolks^(9). Oddly, there were no records of leche flan (whether by Spanish or other traveling foreigners) throughout most of the Spanish period. In fact, it was only around 1883 when the first known flan (and depiction) recipe (Image 9) was depicted which already separates the whites from the yolks which indicates that this may be the leche flan we know.

In the early 1900s, leche flan was served at a typical Sunday lunch menu, along with sopa de fideos, pochero, estofado de lengua, carne asado, rebosadong utak, kondol in syrup, santol in syrup, and other assorted dulces, at the home of Don Jose del Rosario who was known as the Abaca King of Ligao, Bicol^(10). Perhaps around this time, leche flan, which was called custard pudding with caramel sauce, was also served at the Compania Maritima as a dessert for lunch and dinner^(11).

Oddly, the mention of flaon survived as late as 1910, Ms. Mary H. Fee describes a wedding feast for an upper class Filipino couple during her stay in the Philippines in 1901. Given how long it is, I will just give you the part on the desserts.

>At intervals along the table are alluring glass dishes, filled with crystallized fruits. After this come the sweets. There is no cake, as we know it, but meringues (French kisses), baked custard coated with caramel sauce, which they call *flaon*; a kind of cocoanut \[coconut\] macaroon, the little gelatinous seeds of the nipa palm \[*kaong*\], boiled in sugar syrup, and half a dozen kinds of preserves and candied fruits. Tinto \[wine\] accompanies the supper, and possibly champagne.\^12

In 1916, P. Sayo balo ni Soriano has recipes in the cookbook ‘Kusinang Tagalog’ (Image 10) for flan de leche along with other flan flavors such as apple, coffee, orange and Malaga wine^(13).

Most certainly, if one knows how to speak Spanish, one would know that ‘leche flan’ is not how it would be written. One of the most known ways they would write it is as ‘(insert food here) de (insert ingredient, country or anything to differ from the original)’ such as ‘pan de sal’ (bread of salt) and dulce de leche (lit. sweet of milk, known as caramelized milk). This is shown in the numerous flan recipes mentioned in the 1919 Tagalog (by Crispulo Trinidad) edition of P.R. Macosta’s cookbook Pastelería at Repostería Francesca at Española such as ‘\*\*Flan á la Portuguesa’\*\*^(14), ‘*Flan a la parisién*’^(15), ‘*Flan ng̃ crema na may chocolate*’^(16), ‘*Flan ng̃ peras a la germana*’^(17), ‘*Flan de fideos na may casamang dayap*’^(18) among others. Hence, leche flan would have been known as ‘flan de leche’ as would be shown in the early recipes later.

At the same year, the term ‘flanera’ (Image 11) is mentioned in the 1919 (first edition 1916) cookbook ‘Aklat ng Pagluluto’ which is defined as follows:

Ang flanera ay hulmahang lata na may iba't ibang hugis na tinataglay ayon sa kagustuhan ng̃ pumipili.^(19)

This shows that the ‘llanera’ today was also known as a flanera. The former is also used as the term referring to the female version of ‘llanero’ (Image 13), a Colombian and Venezuelan herder (some would say cowboy) from the Llanos grasslands^(20). It is unknown how the ‘flanera’ became the term ‘llanera’. With that, I theorize that, when there were local versions of flanera being made, they needed to find a way to stand out from the other flanera being sold. Hence, they made their flanera oval and called them, ‘llanera’, most likely a shortened version of ‘local flanera’ (or any variation of that) to show that it is a locally made product, or even ‘(insert last name starting with Lla-, such as Llanes or interestingly enough Llanera) flanera’ to show who sold it. Also likely, it could just be a mistake in the spelling that stuck. Eventually, those who used it to make their leche flans called the mold ‘llanera’ and it stuck as the term ‘flanera’ no longer used in reference to leche flan of the Philippines.

With that, one may ask how did flan de leche become leche flan? I theorize that it most likely came during the American period. It was a sort of compromise between Americanizing, hence modernizing their names and keeping the names familiar to its consumers. This may have happened to flan de leche which literally means ‘custard of milk’. Since it is more proper in English to say ‘milk custard’ instead of ‘custard of milk’, leche flan became the term to match that American format especially after World War 2. This is when there would be an influx of recipes for leche flan (or name equivalent), not just the original but also flavored like ube^(21) among others. 

With that, let us look at recipes (4 pre-WW2, 4 post-WW2) for flan de leche (also known as letse plan, leche plan, or now leche flan) in old Philippine cookbooks as arranged in chronological order:

1. ‘Flan de Leche No. 1., No. 3. and No. 19.’ (pp. 91-93, 97) from ‘La Cocina Filipina’ (1913) (Image 13)
2. ‘Leche Flan Popular’ (p. 99) from ‘Condimentos Indigenas’ (1918) by Pura Villanueva Kalaw (Image 14)
3. ‘Flan de leche (a)’ & ‘Flan de leche (b)’ (pp. 115-116) from ‘Aklat ng Pagluluto’ (1919, first edition 1916) by Rosendo Ignacio (Image 15)
4. ‘Flan de Leche Condensada’ (pp. 207-208) from ‘Everyday Cookery for the Home’ (c. 1934, first edition c. 1930) by Sofia Reyes De Veyra & Maria Paz Zamora (Image 16)
5. ‘Palasak na letse plan’ (pp. 83-84) from ‘Mga Lutong Pilipino Aklat ng Pagluluto’ (1949) by Iluminada M. Luna (Image 17)
6. ‘Leche Flan Dessert’ (p. 61) from ‘31-Day Menu Cookbook’ (1949) (Image 18)
7. ‘Leche Plan I (Custard)’ & ‘Leche Plan II (Custard)’ (p. 79) from ‘Popular Philippine Dishes’ (1951) by T.V.T. Soldan (Image 19)
8. ‘Leche Flan’ & ‘Coconut Leche Flan’ (p. 253, image between p. 230 and p. 231) from ‘Your Cookery Guide’ (1958 by Generosa de Leon) (Image 20)

With that, learning more about leche flan and its llanera is a continuous process that requires more access to Philippine and foreign sources. Hopefully, more information would be found to cement the theories I presented.",6,1763543977.0,FilipinoHistory,5,1.0,False

So what happened was after that day, we started talking daily, meeting at a cafe after her shift. We talked so much. She held my hand. And I was not even nervous now. And like always, she was looking so beautiful in my eyes, I can't even tell.

Two nights ago, when we were outside our college campus in a park, sitting and enjoying the cold coffee in the cold weather of Delhi. She again held her head on my shoulder.

We didn't kiss. Neither did I initiate, nor did she feel the need for it. And honestly, I was levitating just being with her.

But then, she saw someone and went still and her mood flipped 180°. It was her Ex. 

Apparently, she was in a 4-year-long, very, very toxic relationship with that guy. That guy made her life hell at one point. That guy cheated on her so much, always manipulated her. And later, it became so toxic for her that one day, when she stood against him, he literally slapped her. And that day she broke up with him. 

This relationship of hers was just 5 months ago, before I met her. (As you would know, I have been seeing her for a month and now we are comfortable).

So back to that park in the evening, as she went, still seeing him, I couldn't understand why she had just stopped laughing. That guy approached our bench, just speaking to her, not even looking at me. She didn't say a word, and he left. That guy is from the near college too. Doing masters. As campuses of colleges in college area are near to eachother so people of different colleges glances at eachother quite often here.

Later, when I asked her what it was, she didn't tell me anything, but I don't know if I overstepped or not. I insisted, but not harshly, but lightly.

She was emotional, telling things, and all I was able to grasp was that she was EMOTIONALLY drained. 

After that relationship, she was having a tough time for a few months before her elder brother helped her out. And when we met, she was great mentally (as that time I could grasp, maybe I grasped wrong, as this is my first ever relationship).

After that confession, when she had some tears, I didn't think about anything, just hugged her. She hugged me back. 
I accompanied her to her pg, told her to calm down. Told her if she needs anything, she can just call me.

We again met yesterday evening, and she was kind of shy and embarrassed that night when she confessed to me about her ex relationship. I told her it's nothing. 
We sat again side by side, talked and talked. She was again happy with me as I could feel it.

I tried to annoy her to make her laugh, which I kind of succeeded.


Now, I want to ask you guys, she has a massive emotional toll. Her last relationship was not good at all. Toxic tbh. 

How to make her feel good and comfortable with me all the time? As this is my first ever relationship. I don't know shit.

I don't know if you will call me a simp or not, but I honestly don't care about her last relationship at all. Even when this is my first. But I care if she is happy with me or not. 


What should I do?

Every time we do a dinner, we always make sure that everyone is able to come and make a big point of it. They all have other friends, but as for me, they’re pretty much the only friends I spend time with - we’re a group of 4. 

Lately, we haven’t hung out as a group of 4 but rather as a bigger group with our extended friends.  I’m not close with the extended friends, but they were more friends with them as we grew up compared to me. Like one of my best friends runs with one of them weekly and that extended friend told me I should come too, but then never proceeded to follow up with officially inviting me. I would’ve loved to come, but I don’t want to invite myself, if that makes sense? 

Anyways, that same best friend - let’s call her Sally (F29) knows I’m struggling with something personal and how I’m basically at my lowest point. She was very sweet and said she’s always there for me, her and the other girls if I chose to share it with them. She was telling me how I should keep myself busy and do things that makes me happy etc. I don’t really open up about my feelings and what I’m going through, but I really needed to let it out. 

Jill (F 30) was planning on a beach trip for her birthday with her sister and didn’t know if we’d be into it, we all said we’d go with her. Jill ended up cancelling the beach trip because her brother gets free flights with the airline he works for so she wanted to keep that weekend open for that. 

Sally and her sister (she’s apart of this group, I’m not as close with her as I am with Sally and Jill) texted me about going to Miami instead. So I agreed, I looked at flights and hotels and sent it to them. I texted Jill too to keep her in the loop in case Jill doesn’t get tickets to fly somewhere. Sally cancels the trip because her sister wasn’t really into it and they might have a family member come into town. I was really excited to do something to get my mind off of things, but I didn’t mind. Sally said we should drive up to the mountains locally instead and her + her sister weren’t sure what we should do. I gave a few suggestions but the weather wasn’t good and I think they weren’t into it so they brought up going to a coffee shop instead. I decided to decline as I honestly wasn’t feeling it and I just felt like I wouldn’t be good company to have as I was really in the trenches emotionally. I didn’t want to fake being happy when I wasn’t. 

Jill ended up going to Japan, and I was happy for her. I sent a suggestion of a restaurant to go to and told her to have a great trip. Sally texted me that she texted Jill that we’re going to have a birthday dinner for Jill on Wednesday. She didn’t ask me if it worked for me or not. We usually discuss in the group chat about dinner dates to make sure it works for everyone. Initially I didn’t think much of it (I guess they know I’m always available lol), but I realized that’s the day I’m working very late and then I’m working early the next day. 

So I texted the group chat

ME: Hey I know Sally and Jill talked about a dinner on Wednesday, but I realized that’s the day I work until 8pm (potentially) and then I work the next day too so probs not the best night. 

What’s another night everyone’s free?

ME: Or if Wednesday is the best day yall can get dinner and I can see if I can make it

JILL: Wednesday does work well but I can do Thursday ¿ or see you separately lol 

ME: Sure, that’s fine w Wednesday 

SALLY’S SIS: I’m fine with either but Ik Sally has to go home Thursday bc she works at ___ 

SALLY: Wednesday works better 4 me personally

SALLY: Also it’s gonna be the (restaurant) right next to (the place I work) 

ME: Sure, I don’t want to cause an inconvenience. Yall have fun!! 

Yes, I know I said everything was fine and offered not to go - I’m a big people pleaser. But I want to celebrate Jill’s birthday with the group? They didn’t try to set another day so I could come and I didn’t want to force them, if that makes sense. We always make a big point of trying to have all of us come to dinners. I don’t know if it’s because I’m in this low point in my situation that’s affecting me that I feel so sensitive about this. It just made me not feel valued. A birthday dinner hurts more than just a regular dinner. 

Should I say something? I never want to rock the boat, so I tend to internalize my feelings. Also, I want actions to be intentional rather than out of pity if that makes sense? I was thinking about texting Sally and telling her how I felt but idk. What should I do?

TLDR: My best friends have a birthday dinner that they planned without my input about availability. I asked them if there was another day we could do it so I could come celebrate too and I also offered to not come. They all stayed with the same date, but I guess I also made it sound like it was okay because I am a people pleaser. One of them knows I’m going through a tough time right now. Should I say something about how it hurts that they’re doing the birthday dinner without me?

I was working with this girl for around four years or so. We became good work friends, but over that time I began to develop feelings for her, so early last year I asked her out, but she had a boyfriend at the time (I didn't know obviously), so that didn't pan out. Fortunately she's really chill so we got back to being work friends pretty quickly. Despite dating a couple of girls after that, my feelings for her never truly dissipated.

Anyway, fast forward to one random Saturday on July of this year (random for me, the last day of work for her) and this particular girl walks up to me, asked if wanted to grab a drink. I played it cool but deep down I was ecstatic. I've dated a handful of girls in my time, but this is the first one that I've had a major crush on before hand, so for me this was a literal dream come true.

So we go out and have a really good time and I end up sleeping at her place. We catch up a few more times over the course of the next two months, however things start to take a turn for her. I won't delve too deeply into things, but she has a mother who is going through a lot mentally and had been sending her some pretty terrible messages. On top of that, this girl is diagnosed and medicated for borderline personality disorder (something I learned while we were dating), so she was struggling with that along with a packed schedule of working at a new job as well as her commitment to other activities. 

After a couple of weeks of kinda weak communication she finally invites me over to talk (she's always been pretty open about her feelings) and that night she basically lays it all on the table regarding her current situation, how she's feeling, her history with the disorder and what it means going forward. She admits that she saw a future with me, but now with everything she's going through she's scared of hurting me and even admitted that she doesn't think she's deserving of love, most of this being told through tears. Despite all this I made it clear that I understood what she was saying and would leave if she felt that was best for both of us, but also made sure she knew that I wanted to stick around and try to help her get through things together. While she was honest with me, I could tell that she didn't want to make the decision to break things off and at some point asked if I wanted to stay the night. I did, and we had a really nice night of cuddling and hand holding, which continued into the morning where she delayed her work alarm for two hours just so we could cuddle for as long as possible.

Eventually we got up, had coffee and watched some TV before parting ways with a hug and her telling me that we should ""take a step back"". I decided to give her some space, but messaged her a little over a week later to see how she was doing. She got back to me a couple of hours later and said that she wasn't in the right frame of mind for a conversation, but that she didn't wanna leave me on read, something that had happened once in the past but also made clear that it wasn't because she was ""ghosting me"". 

The reason I eventually stopped messaging her was the week after that, where I messaged her for the second time since our major talk. This time it took her over a day and a half to get back to me, where she explained that she was pretty exhausted and that she has no free time anymore, even during the weekend, before asking how I was doing. She never replied to my response and that was in mid September. I wanted to see if she would initiate a conversation after that last message, but she never did.

That girl hasn't left my mind since and whilst I've been standing strong against my desire to text her due to a mixture of dignity and frustration, along with keeping myself busy with work, I'm really starting to wonder if there's any real harm in reaching out. Should I just swallow my pride and do it, or would it be best to just let her reach out to me?",4,1763543434.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

1p12qn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1p12qn1/my_agilescrum_experience/,My agile/scrum experience,"After ten years of computer science education, culminating in multiple advanced degrees, millions of dollars in student loans, and fuck-all in job prospects, I finally was offered a position at a federal government contractor called Cyclops. 

I was so desperate for a job, I overlooked many red flags—from the job description (“We desire fresh human meat flesh,” it began), to the interview, during which my interviewer had to “galvanize” himself multiple times with a cattle prod. 

Fact was, I didn’t have much of a choice in the matter, so I said “sure.”

On my first day, I showed up at 9am, and was greeted by a Cyclops VP, Dr. Thaumaturgist. He was a hideously deformed creature, the result (I later learned) of a horrific accident with the occult, whereby he’d attempted to use the dark powers of the Necronomicon to become the boot-licking toady of Nyarlahotep, but which only resulted in his becoming Cyclops’ boot-licking VP of Federal. 

He walked me through the office, down a terrifying psychomantic corridor, to a bright room filled with cubicles, and pointed at one at random. “Here’s your desk. We had a guy quit last week, so we’re just plugging you in for him. Here’s the backlog.” He handed me a large box filled with a bunch of index cards. I asked what they were.

“JIRA tickets,” he said. “Don’t worry about reading them. You can’t make any sense out of them—you have to use the JIRA browser extension, which overlays a bunch of shit over the cards.”

“But—”

“Also, we don’t have a JIRA license, so you need to run JIRA in a virtual machine, which only runs on Windows, and is extremely slow, so you need a really beefy laptop. We don’t provide laptops, so you’ll have to buy one.”

At this he gave an unsettling snort, which caused some sort of sticky stuff to ooze from the large hole in his nose. He went on, “I’ll be honest, our process is broken as shit. We actually have a bunch of stand-ups every day—a couple of Scrums, one for Kanban, one to discuss JIRA, one with our PM, one to discuss whatever random shit we did at yesterday’s stand-ups, etc.—so we’re all just super overloaded. I mean if we were expected to produce something, I’m not sure when we’d do it. 

“But hey, we got Booz and McKinsey in here so—not my monkeys, not my circus, y’know, kid?!” He guffawed, catching the tip of his nose in one hand as it fell off, and wandered away. 

I had just settled into my desk, wondering what I should be doing since I didn’t have a computer, when a waxen-faced, stick-thin man peeped over the cube wall at me. “Psst…” he said.

“Oh, hi, I’m…” I began but he frantically shushed me. “Hey, man, no names, okay? That’s how they can control us. Just refer to me as ‘Scrum master.’”

“Uh, okay, uh, Scrum, I’m Full Stack,” I whispered back, peering around. The paranoia was catching.

“Cool, cool. We have another stand up in ten minutes, so I just want to get you oriented. We don’t actually do any real work—that’s handled by a third-party in India, who probably aren’t even following the Scrum process. What we’re doing here is just pretending that we’re modernizing the customers infrastructure. If we have meetings and write JIRA tickets, the CTO on the client side can pretend that we’re doing agile. Then he can tell all the stakeholders that we’re following industry best practices. You’re cool with that, right?”

“I guess. Sounds like…”

“Fucked up? Yeah it’s  fucked up. We actually used to do real work, but all that stopped when Cthulhu and the other Outer Gods returned to Earth in 2016.”

“Uh, I’m not sure I heard about…”

“Shh!” he said, shaking a finger at me. “You wouldn’t even know, you were still in school.”

Just then, a man wearing a top hat and a monocle strode up. He was wearing an ancient three-piece suit with the vest unbuttoned, revealing his exposed ribcage. He peered into my cube. “Hey, Full Stack,” he said.

“Hi!” I said, trying not to be upset seeing his intestines underneath the waistcoat. He was the first person id seen in the office who wasn’t wearing business casual and it made me nervous I was under dressed. 

“I’m the Program Manager,” he said. “And I’ve got a big present for you.” He grinned, exposing rows of razor-sharp teeth. He reached into his vest and drew out a large, brown, dried thing. “It’s the Gantt chart for the entire project. Printed on human skin!”

“Uh, that’s….but…”

“Full Stack! Get your coffee!” Interrupted Scrum master. “It’s our third morning stand up!”

“Uh, okay, what do I do?” I asked, feeling more and more unprepared by the moment. I knew how to program, but that didn’t appear to be part of this job. 

“Yeah,” he said. “So the first thing is we stand in a circle. You start off by saying what you’re working on today, and then we take turns. Oh, and it’s not really important what we say—as long as we say something. Then, we drink coffee. Coffee with the heart of a child in it.”

“What?” I said.

“You didn’t read the employee handbook? It’s in there. We have to drink coffee with the heart of a child in it. It’s a regular ceremony, some kind of team bonding thing. And then we’ll stand in a circle and do some role-playing. Today we’re going to be playing the part of Azathoth.”

“Who?” I said.

“Azathoth. You know, the blind idiot god?” He furrowed his brow at me. “You should probably read the employee handbook.”

“Can we get this over with?” said the skeleton program manager in a bored tone. “I’m late for my sacrifice to Yog-Sothoth.”

Scrum master nodded and we walked to the meeting room. When we got there, there were about 12 people in the room, all standing in a circle. I was the only new person, so everyone looked at me.

“Hey, team!” said Scrum master, as he clapped his hands together. “We have a new member—number 13! today—Full Stack, why don’t you introduce yourself?”

“Hey,” I said, giving an awkward wave. “I’m Full Stack, I’m a developer.”

“That’s great,” said Scrum master. “We’ll go around the circle. Say your role only, heh heh, don’t want ‘em knowing how to liquefy the old brain, right? And then, tell us what demon you most relate to. 

“Oh and don’t forget to say the words ‘agile’ or ‘JIRA’ at some point. Booz Allen is videotaping this today for auditing and compliance. Okay go!” 

It seemed to take an eternity. Everyone made a bunch of elaborate hand gestures and used incomprehensible vocabulary from Jira, and then we moved on to the “coffee ceremony.” Scrum master had brought along a big thermos of coffee and, one by one, everyone walked over to him and got a cup. Scrum master handed me a cup, and when I took a sip, I nearly spat it out. It was the most godawful, rank liquid I’d ever tasted, and I noticed floating in it a small brown clump.

“Wow,” I said. “How do you drink this stuff?”

“You get used to it,” said Scrum master. “I’ve been doing this for a few years now. And it doesn’t get any easier.” He looked down at the brown clump. “Oh look! First day and you got the child heart! Well, aren’t YOU favored?” 

After the coffee, Scrum master got out a book of role-playing games and began handing out cards. “Today we’re going to be Azathoth. Azathoth is the blind idiot god, he is an amorphous mass who lies dreaming on the throne of the Outer Gods.”

He divided us into two groups—one group was going to be Azathoth and the other group was going to ask him questions. “Remember,” he said, as he handed out the cards, “you have to use your imagination, and you can’t improvise.” 

It was the weirdest goddamned thing I’ve ever seen. We were trying to figure out what we were supposed to do as Azathoth, and everyone was confused. “I’m not even sure what the Outer Gods are,” I whispered to Scrum master.

“They’re, like, gods that are outside of time and space,” he said. “I’m not sure either, I just do this shit.”

“Who are the Outer Gods?” asked one of the role-players.

“I am the Outer Gods,” replied one of the Azathoths. “All the Outer Gods are me.”

It went on like this for another hour or so. I just kept drinking child-heart coffee and nodding along. 

Finally we broke for lunch, and I went to get a sandwich at a nearby Subway along with most of the other people in the office. 

When we came back, Scrum master looked like he’d been crying, but no one said anything. “Great news!” Scrum yelled. “McKinsey sent us a new process to use! We’re going to Kanban now!”

“What?” asked another developer who’d introduced himself as Front End (Level II), 

“Kanban!” Scrum Master screamed hysterically. “It’s a Japanese word that means… I don’t know what it means! I guess it’s a type of process! 

“Anyway, all you need to know is we’re not going to do Scrum anymore. Instead, we’re going to do Kanban.” 

As he spoke, he was almost absentmindedly tearing up a piece of paper I hadn’t noticed before. (“I think that’s his Scrum Master certification,” Front End whispered to me.) 

“So we’re not going to have daily Scrums, instead, we’re going to have Kanban stand-ups. But other than that, everything’s the same. Just like Scrum. Everything’s going to be the same. 

“We’re still going to do fake work, we’re still going to have stand-ups, we’re still going to be pretending to follow industry best practices. Only now we have new words for everything!”

The team stared at him.. 

Just then a man who looked like a cross between the Grim Reaper and your old high school gym teacher sidled up to us. “I’m the Kanban coach,” he said. “I heard you had some questions about Kanban.”

“No,” said Scrum master. “I was just explaining how Kanban is like Scrum, but better, and how a Scrum Master can run a Kanban…”

“No,” interrupted the Coach. “Scrum is not like Kanban. Kanban is about flow. We’re going to use the Kanban board to show flow. It’s going to be awesome.”

I had horrible dreams that night. 

The next day, when I sat down at my desk (still without a computer) I was surprised to notice that my only friend, Scrum Master, was gone, and appeared to have cleared out his whole cubicle. Just then Dr. Thaumaturgy strolled by. “Oh, Full Stack! Glad I ran into you. Emergency All Hands at 1300 hours, in Blood.”

“Uh, I’m sorry sir, in what?”

Dr. T. laughed heartily. “Oh, that’s the big conference room just outside the kitchen! You’ll get used to it all soon. Gristle is the little conference room under the stairs, and Sebum is the medium sized conference room near my office. See you then!” And Dr. T. ambled off, leaving me more bewildered than before.

At 1300 hours, I joined the rest of the company in Blood, where Program Manager Skeletor was addressing us.

“Well, I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news,” he wheezed, fingering his human skin project schedule obsessively. “Good news is we’re going to be doing pair programming.”

Everyone stared at him. I wondered if I was the only one who didn’t understand what this was.

“Bad news is… uh, I don’t have any bad news.”

I raised my hand tentatively. “Uh, is Scrum Master out sick?”

“Great,” he said. “I’m glad everyone’s excited about pair programming.”

I guessed my question hadn’t been heard. That’s okay, I’m a team player who doesn’t cause problems. 

The PM continued.  “So we’re going to be using a new style of pair programming, where the two programmers write their code, naked, in a bathtub full of blood. Let’s get started, everyone!” He threw a banana at my head and when I opened my mouth in shock, he threw a Duplo block in my mouth, choking me. The other staff snickered as they filed out of the room. “Hey, he really got you,” said one woman.

“Don’t worry about it, it’s just hazing,” Front End reassured me in the men’s room where I went to try and dislodge the Duplo in my throat. 

At the end of the week, I asked the guy who now sat next to me, a tall man who resembled a shambling mound, about how we got our paychecks. 

“Oh, they don’t give out paychecks here,” he said.

“Uh, what?” I said.

“Oh, it’s like an experiment,” he said. “We stopped giving out paychecks during COVID, and nobody who complained came back to work, so they just, you know, stopped. But we do have some pretty nice benefits. We have beer on tap in the kitchen, and every April Fools there’s a pretend bonus, which is pretty funny.” 

“Oh,” I said, and then asked the only question I could think of. “What’s the program manager’s name again?”

“Oh, him?” said Shambling Mound. “That’s R’Lyeh. You need to talk to dread Chthulhu, you’re going through him first. Hey, have a great weekend, man!” ",0,1763543199.0,agile,0,0.14,False

1p12ie5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p12ie5,First Patagonia purchase — which one should I keep on a €150 budget? Synchilla jacket vs Synchilla Snap-T vs Better Sweater,"Hey all — I’d love some honest opinions.

I just bought a Patagonia Synchilla jacket and I like the fit, but I’m having second thoughts. I’m looking for one Patagonia piece (~€150 max) that I’ll actually use a lot — something that can work as:

• a mid-layer under a shell when it’s chilly,
• an indoor sweater for writing/coffee/cafés, and
• an outer jacket for everyday fall / spring days (roughly 8–18°C).

Options I’m considering (all roughly the same budget):
	•	Keep the Synchilla jacket (the one I already bought)
	•	Exchange for the Synchilla Snap-T (pullover with snap placket)
	•	Get the Better Sweater (sweater-knit look, full zip)

A few things about me that might help with recommendations: I’m a writer/researcher, I spend time in cafés and on nature walks, I like comfortable but versatile pieces, and I want something that’s not just “for hiking” — I want it to pass in everyday life too.

If you’ve owned any of these, can you share:
	1.	How well each works as an indoor sweater? (comfort, bulk, look)
	2.	How they behave as a mid-layer under a shell — do they layer smoothly or feel too bulky?
	3.	How each performs as a standalone outer layer in 8–18°C — warmth vs overheating vs breathability?
	4.	Any thoughts on fit/size — do you size down/up for layering or go true to size?
	5.	Durability/value: would you say it’s worth ~€150 for your experience?
	6.	If you could keep only one Patagonia piece at that price, which one would it be and why?

Extra bonus: if you’ve used them in European weather (wet/windy days), any tips on adding a lightweight shell or accessories that make one option work better?

Thanks — I’m leaning toward keeping the Synchilla because of the fit, but I want to make sure I’m not missing a more versatile choice. Appreciate your thoughts! 🙏",1,1763542442.0,PatagoniaClothing,1,1.0,False
1p12hsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/advanced_english/comments/1p12hsc/wanna_sound_like_a_native_speaker/,Wanna Sound like a Native Speaker,"Sounding more like a native speaker is not difficult, but requires practicing speaking in a way that differs from simply reading aloud from books. Many students sound ""more like a book than a real person"" because they are not used to hearing English sounds connected with the words they read.

The challenge in English is that native speakers do ""all sorts of strange things"" when they speak quickly:
They connect words (e.g., ""I get up"").
They use contractions (e.g., ""I will"" becomes ""I'll go"").
They add sounds, drop sounds, even change sounds when words come
together.

They leave out whole words (e.g., ""I'm going to the pub, are you coming"" might become ""I'm going to the pub, coming"").
The video helps learners hear and practice these common examples of natural spoken English that differ from the written words.
Key Reductions and Contractions to Practice
Common Questions and Phrases:
""Do you want a coffee"" often becomes ""do you wanna coffee"".
The more polite question ""Would you like a coffee"" is typically used by
waiters or when speaking to someone you don't know well.

The 'H' Drop in Questions:
When auxiliary verbs are used in questions with the pronoun he, the 'h' sound often disappears.
""Was he"" becomes ""wuzzy"" (e.g., ""Was he happy"").
""Has he"" becomes ""hazy"" (e.g., ""Has he called you"").
Contractions for Fluency (Wanna, Gonna, Shoulda):
The use of contractions like ""wanna"" (want to) and ""gonna"" (going to) is suitable for IELTS Speaking because it is a test of natural conversational English.

""I am going to go"" becomes ""I'm gonna go"". Crucially, the ""gonna"" already includes ""to,"" so you should not say ""I'm gonna to go"".
""I want to go"" becomes ""I wanna go"".
""Shall we go"" becomes ""should we go"". This is used as a suggestion.
To express regret in the past, ""I should have gone"" becomes ""I shoulda
gone"".

The Goal of Practice
The goal is not to sound like a ""perfect native English speaker"". That model is often impossible and unnecessary, leading to frustration. The purpose of
practicing these sounds is to improve your pronunciation and better control your pronunciation to get a higher score on IELTS speaking. The process should be fun, focusing on practice, not perfection.",1,1763542384.0,advanced_english,0,1.0,False

My twitching started suddenly 14 months ago (September 2024) after a tetanus vaccine and since then it has moved all over my body — calves, thighs, arms, shoulders, face, and hands. I’ve had periods of more intense “hotspots,” especially in the deltoid, thigh, thumb, and index finger, but I’ve never had any weakness or loss of function. I continue to walk 4 km every night.

I’ve seen four neurologists in total. All clinical exams were normal. My blood tests (ANA, ENA, electrophoresis) were normal and an MRI showed only a benign capillary telangiectasia, unrelated to the twitching. I’ve now had two EMGs: one early on (40 days after onset) and one three months ago, at 11 months in. The recent EMG was done by an EMG specialist and included the right arm and both legs with needle EMG and NCS. It was completely normal.

Over the last two months the twitching has improved by more than 90%. Most days I got only a few random pops or short tiny runs. However, in the last week i got some new hotspots after the morning coffee (which never affected me so far): one day on the thigh for a few hours, then after a couple of days the right pinky. This stopped in a day and a couple of days the left pinky, then again migrating to the right one. These episodes still trigger anxiety even though they disappear again and the EMG was clean. Sometimes i took a muscle relaxant (Norgesic) which seems to help the hotspot stop.

I had mild COVID about a month ago and interestingly the twitching was minimal during that time. Recently I've had alternating days with and without tinnitus, which my ENT said is benign.

At this point I’ve had 14 months of twitching, no progression, multiple normal clinical exams, and two normal EMGs—yet anxiety still flares up whenever a new twitch appears. Should i revisit the neurologist? For those with long-term BFS: do you still get new hotspots after a year or more? Does coffee trigger your twitches even though it did not previously? And how did you finally manage the anxiety after clean exams?",1,1763542101.0,BFS,3,1.0,False

I’m 20 and work a 9–5 corporate job, and honestly… making friends as an adult is harder than I expected 😭 I know how to make friends, but I just don’t meet people in similar situations, and it gets a bit lonely.

I’d love to connect with someone around my age who’s also navigating work, independence, and adulthood. Someone I can relate to, chat with, maybe grab coffee with and if we vibe long-term, I’m open to it becoming something more (nothing rushed).

A bit about me:
• I’m Black, caramel complexion
• 5'2, petite with a slightly chubby build, I work out here and there
• Live in Cape Town
• Corporate girlie trying to figure life out lol

Physical attraction does matter to me (as it does to most people), so I prefer exchanging pictures early on. If you’re not comfortable sending one right away, you can describe yourself the way I did, that’s totally okay :)

Looking for someone between 21–25 (if you're older, spare yourself), ideally someone stable or actively ""building"", kind, thoughtful, and also looking for something genuine, whether friendship or something deeper if it naturally develops.

We made it clear in the beginning and throughout the relationship that we both wanted kids and marriage eventually. Everything was going well until the beginning of the year when he tried buying a house that he said would be for us both to live in and grow together but it ended up falling through. During this time I knew he was very stressed with everything and I tried to be helpful and talk with him about things but he ended up basically discarding me and only spending his free time with his family and not talking to me. He told me that I had never bought a house before so that’s why he couldn’t talk to me about it and that I was a burden to talk to and I was the only person in his life that didn’t make his life easier. I knew he didn’t like to be bothered so I wouldn’t text him unless he texted me first and I did not call him to ask to hang out, I always let him be the one to ask to hang out because he felt smothered with too much communication. This really hurt my feelings, I never minded him spending time with his family I just wanted some communication and to be included in conversation since he said the house was for both of us. The only time I got upset with him while he was with his family was one day when we had plans for later that night and he said he had a meeting with the mortgage company that morning. He did not like to be bothered when he was busy so I waited 5-6 hours before calling him. During the time i was waiting, I turned down hanging out with my friends because I knew we had plans together. So I finally call him and he says that he was at his mom’s house talking. I was annoyed just because he did not communicate that plans changed. His family called me manipulative after that even after I explained that I just wanted communication, I did not mind that he was with his family. We had some differences in opinions about the house, he was very tight with money and shot down all my ideas of painting (he said paint was a waste of money and not needed) and putting down flooring in the 2 bedrooms since it was unfinished concrete. I even said that I did not mind helping pay for repairs since I would be living there but still I was shot down about everything you could think of. The house fell through due to the bank deeming it “unlivable”, so I asked if he wanted to move in with me and we could take the next step that way. He said no because he did not want to help pay rent. He had been living rent free in his grandmas house since he was 18 years old. I thought this would be an easy transition since he was already at my apartment like 4 days a week anyways. After the house fell through I did not bring up looking at other houses for sale because he would get very upset with me so I just decided to leave the matter alone.

First he told me we had to wait to get married until he was 30 because that’s how old his dad was when he got married, after he turned 30 he then changed it to I had to pay my car off before getting married because he didn’t want to be with someone in debt and debt is bad. I paid my brand new car off in 17 months and then he changed it to I had to learn to be happy with myself before getting married. I told him I was confused with what he meant because I am completely financially independent, I have a job I love, and I have great relationships with friends and family. I felt like he was always moving the goalposts. 

He progressively became meaner and meaner, he always nitpicked me about everything. For example: he called my clothes “slob wear”, the coffee I drank was “bullshit coffee”, the tv shows I watched were dumb, the music I listened to was dumb, and he said I have a fake COVID degree. This was really offensive because I worked very hard for my nursing degree. Every time I said something hurt my feelings he would say “you like when I’m mean”. I truly felt like nothing I did was ever right.

When he told me things that I did or said that he didn’t like I tried to change. Sometimes he would be vague and just say that I was always guilt tripping him. I asked him for examples because I don’t mean to upset him so I want to fix whatever it is and he would respond with “I don’t know I don’t write down everything you do or say”. So I genuinely don’t know what I was supposed to do. When he was upset he usually liked to give the silent treatment which hurt a lot, I tried telling him that talking about things will help rather than keeping things in.

I worked a lot over the past couple of months to pay my car off. We didn’t see each other for almost 2 weeks at one point due to conflicting schedules. When we finally saw each other I was so excited and I asked if he was excited to see me too. He responded with “no not really. I don’t get excited about anything, it’s better to stay neutral about things in life”. I asked if he was okay because that was kind of concerning to me that he didn’t have excitement about ANYTHING in life. I told him that we could talk about it but if he didn’t want to talk with me then maybe he should talk about things with a professional. He said “real men don’t need therapy”.

Before we went on a trip in September, I asked him to go see a movie with me in theaters and he made a big deal about how he didn’t want to go and how stupid it was and why I couldn’t just go with someone else. I told him I had asked other friends but they were all busy and I thought maybe he would be okay with going to one thing I was interested in. I told him I just wish he respected my interests even if he didn’t like them. I used the example of how I don’t like talking about computers or guns but I do it because it’s something he enjoys. I told him that compromise is part of relationships. He told me “well I’m not an actor, I can’t pretend to be interested in the things that you are interested in”. Flash forward after the trip and everything was great honestly, even the day we broke up was a good day at first. I had been cleaning my apartment and he was playing a video game for a couple hours. I get bored doing that so I asked if he wanted to maybe play a game together. And all of sudden his mood just changed and he said “no you don’t like computer stuff, remember? So we’re never playing games again.” I go over the conversation from 2 weeks earlier and about how I still want to do things with him I just want respect. I asked if he was going to hold things over my head forever and he said “I don’t know, maybe. You should learn to choose your words more wisely next time” and he had a smirk on his face. I just decided I couldn’t take it anymore and I broke up with him right then. I told him he would never hear from me again and I have stood by that and have not contacted him.

1p1272d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1272d,"Too Late, Augustine (free link please)","Chapter 1

After the divorce, I left Las Vegas without a moment's hesitation.

I headed to Dubai alone, ready to start anew.

Over time, I carved out a name for myself in the shadowy world of Middle Eastern arms dealing.

Then, whispers from Las Vegas reached me: my ex-husband, Augustine Clayton, was about to get engaged to his little mistress.

I ran my fingers over the bullet pendant around my neck.

Eight years ago, during a brutal gang shootout, he'd taken that bullet for me. It had grazed perilously close to his heart, missing by a hair's breadth.

Once the surgeons pulled it out, he fashioned it into a necklace and slipped it around my neck.

His voice was soft, almost tender, as he whispered, ""From now on, my life is yours.""

Snapping back to the present, I yanked the chain off without a second thought and tossed it into the trash.

Back then, everyone sneered that I was just some prize Augustine had won at the casino tables—that without him, I'd be nothing.

Seven years later, I returned to Las Vegas to open a new mine.

At the negotiation table, Augustine, who ruled half the city, locked eyes with me, and in that instant, tears welled up in his eyes.

I, however, remembered what had happened at his father's funeral seven years earlier.

That day, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his mistress, letting her play the part of his wife, graciously accepting condolences from family and friends.

That day, I learned my husband had built a cozy little home with her in Centennial Hills.

***

I slid the divorce papers across the table to Augustine, calm and collected as ever.

""Sign them.""

Augustine arched an eyebrow, his expression dripping with amusement.

Tucked beneath the agreement was a newspaper, sensationalized to the hilt, detailing how Augustine's lover, Cecilia Webster, had stolen the spotlight at the funeral, leaving his real wife humiliated and sidelined.

""Kassandra, must you play these childish games again?"" he asked casually.

""For eight years, you've dangled divorce over my head like a threat—must be at least a hundred times by now. Haven't you gotten tired of this routine?""

Then he fished a black card out of his pocket and flicked it onto the table.

""If that's not enough, just hit up Brad—he'll wire you more. I've been swamped with work lately, but you can call me if you need anything.""

I didn't take the card. I simply cast a cool glance at Cecilia in his arms.

All the women Augustine had paraded around these years looked just like her.

I knew exactly why Augustine never married Cecilia after she came back.

After all, the wife of the underground king wasn't meant for the one he loved—it was for the one who fit the role, the strategic choice.

""You planning to keep her as your side piece forever?""

I nudged the divorce papers forward again.

Cecilia pouted in annoyance, clearly stung by the ""side piece"" label. She cooed in that saccharine voice of hers, ""Ms. Lambert, love's between two people. The one who's not loved is the real side piece.""

Augustine chuckled lightly, saying nothing to contradict her.

He stroked her cheek affectionately, then turned to me. ""We'll go to the church tomorrow morning. Don't be late.""

I didn't look away until his figure faded.

Every week, Augustine dragged me to church, saying it would cleanse us of our sins.

His mother, Shelly Clayton, often hinted that my barren womb was proof of my sin.

And Augustine? He saw my intolerance for his mistresses as the sin of jealousy.

Stepping into the church, I closed my eyes and began to pray.

When Augustine arrived, an inexplicable wave of panic gripped my heart.

""Kassandra,"" he called out.

My pulse quickened, a knot tightening in my chest.

""A sorcerer told me Cecilia's in for some bad luck this year. The only way to ward it off is to soak her feet in water mixed with your father's ashes.""

I shot to my feet, staring into his cold, impassive eyes in utter shock—then burst into a hollow laugh.

""Augustine, eight years ago, I consulted a fortune teller about us. I lied and said we were a perfect match, but the truth? He told me you will ruin my life, and we will never have a baby.

""If you so much as touch my father's grave, I'll smash your father's coffin to splinters.""

Over the years, I'd cried and raged over his endless affairs.

I'd learned the hard way: in this cutthroat jungle, no man respected a woman who endured everything without fighting back.

His face darkened in an instant.

""Do it!"" he ordered, his voice stern, brooking no dissent.

""Augustine!""

His henchmen pinned me down with iron grips, while the others desecrated my father's grave right before my eyes.

""Kassandra, this is for your father's own good. Ashes are useless. Helping Cecilia out? It's an honor for him.""

""Get the hell off me!""

Fueled by the absurdity of it all, I lashed out, shoving his goons aside and snatching the urn back.

Then, a brutal blow cracked against the back of my head.

Warm blood trickled down my forehead, blurring my vision.

I couldn't hold onto the urn anymore. Soon, someone ripped it from my arms.

In agony, I raised my head and, under the harsh sun, saw Augustine's cold face.

""Deliver it to the sorcerer,"" he said.

I forced a bitter smile and then blacked out.


Chapter 2

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

My loyal aide filled me in: Augustine had spent the last few days in Centennial Hills with Cecilia.

He had used my father's ashes for some twisted black magic ritual, trying to bind my dad's spirit, forcing his ghost to serve Cecilia like some obedient phantom.

I yanked out the IV needle, gathered a squad of men I'd trained, and went straight there.

Cecilia was lounging on the sofa, sipping coffee, her face draining of color when she saw me burst through the door.

I scanned the opulent villa and found a brand-new altar in the corner.

There, staring back at me, was my father's portrait.

The sight ignited an inferno of rage inside me, flames licking at my veins.

""Kassandra, you're not welcome here! If you try anything, I'll make sure Augustine...""

Before she could finish her threat, I lunged, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking her toward the altar.

""Looks like you still don't get it.

""I'm Augustine's real wife. Every damn penny from his arms empire? Half of it's mine! If I want you out of here, you won't last an hour.""

I stamped on her wrist with my combat boot, grinding down hard.

Cecilia let out a piercing shriek, agony ripping through her.

""You... you old hag! Augustine will never let you get away with this!""

I sneered, tightening my grip on her hair and slamming her face into the floor.

""You think you can stay young forever? In this world, youth is the cheapest commodity.

""You wanted my dad's ashes to break your curse? Foot-soaking's not enough. Here—drink every last drop of that filthy water!""

I signaled my men to hold her down, then poured the basin of ash-tainted water straight down her throat.

For every spill, I slapped her hard across the face.

By the time I let go, her cheeks were swollen, her lips bloodied.

Suddenly, urgent footsteps echoed behind us.

Augustine arrived, radiating an arctic chill, his private army following close behind, all weapons drawn and ready.

""Kassandra, you've crossed the line.""

His voice was a frozen blade as he bent down and scooped up the limp woman in his arms.

I met his glare head-on. ""Mr. Clayton, compared to what you've done, this is nothing.""

His eyes blazed with arctic rage.

""Throw her into the snake pit out back. No one pulls her out without my order.""

It was the venomous viper den he'd excavated just to indulge Cecilia's twisted whims.

""You wanted to watch an execution, right? Today, you'll get your fill,"" he murmured tenderly to the woman in his embrace.

Two burly guards dragged me roughly toward the rear of the property.

In the chilling depths of the cavern, serpents slithered forth, fangs sinking into my flesh with searing venom.

Agony exploded through me, blood soaking my clothes in a warm, sticky flood.

Before oblivion claimed me, I caught Cecilia's triumphant cackle.

I twisted my lips into a silent, sardonic smile.

Eight years ago, in front of all the crime lords, Augustine had sworn he'd only ever want me.

But his heart and his vows? They'd soured in just eight short years.

***

I spent two weeks in the hospital, nursing my wounds back to health.

During that time, the scandal exploded across Las Vegas: Augustine Clayton, pampering his mistress while letting his own wife bleed out in a snake pit. The whole city was buzzing.

On the day I was discharged, I made good on my promise—I shattered Augustine's father's coffin to pieces.

After venting my fury, I went to see Shelly.

""Shelly,"" I said, stepping into the room.

She opened her eyes, her gaze a tangled mix of pity and resignation.

""Could you pass this divorce agreement to Augustine for me?"" I handed over the papers, along with the newspaper that described my humiliating story.

""Kassandra, men are all the same. You need to wise up. Compared to power and money, love's just a fleeting illusion.

""Only when you stop letting a man control your heart do you truly come out on top.""

The destruction of her husband's coffin didn't faze her in the least.

In their youth, Augustine's father had chased countless mistresses and left a string of illegitimate children. She'd long since lost any illusions about him.

""Shelly, I married Augustine not because he was some rich heir, but because he was Augustine.""

It was love at first sight. Back in the boxing ring, covered in blood, his eyes fierce and unyielding—that image had pierced straight through my soul.

These eight years, leveraging the Clayton family's influence to build arms channels and a network of my own. I was no longer the vulnerable girl who needed his protection.

I'd stayed by his side only because I couldn't let go of that love, even as it rotted away.

""Once you're divorced, his mistresses will trample all over you,"" Shelly said.

I smiled. ""If she's got what it takes, let her try to climb.""


Chapter 3

When it came to Augustine's mistress, I felt nothing.

I knew Cecilia wasn't much of a threat.

A woman like her could only rely on her looks, and no true arms dealer would ever marry a woman who had nothing but a pretty face to offer.

Shelly stayed silent for a long time before finally ordering the maid to take away the divorce papers and the newspaper.

She stared at me for a while, then sighed. ""You know, there are countless women who would kill to be in your position.""

I didn't respond, just offered her a slight, respectful bow, and turned to leave.

Everyone envied me for standing at the pinnacle of power in Las Vegas, but only I knew what it truly cost.

My marriage with Augustine was like a field of poppies—beautiful on the surface but poisonous at its core.

As I stepped out, I ran into Augustine's cousin, Felicia Clayton.

""I thought you'd tolerate him for the rest of your life,"" she said dryly.

""I used to think so too,"" I replied with a faint smile.

She smirked. ""I'll admit, I never really liked you. But between you and that tramp from the red-light district in Mexico, I'd pick you any day.""

""You've been with him for eight years,"" she continued, folding her arms. ""You're really just going to walk away? Don't you feel it's a waste? You could still cash out.""

I chuckled. ""If I stay any longer, I might not make it out alive. What good is his money if I'm dead?""

Felicia burst out laughing. ""Relax. Good men are everywhere! After the divorce, I'll introduce you to someone—better than Augustine, richer than Augustine, and probably more of a gentleman too.""

***

That evening, Shelly's maid brought me the signed divorce papers.

I immediately sent them to the courthouse to finalize the process. Then, finally allowing myself to relax, I drew a hot bath.

Just as I was sinking into the water with a glass of red wine, the door burst open. Augustine stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.

He braced his arms on the edge of the tub, trapping me between them, his voice low and lazy. ""Good evening, darling.""

My hand froze midair.

I realized then that Shelly must've tricked him into signing those papers. He clearly had no idea what he'd signed.

Otherwise, he wouldn't still be calling me ""darling.""

I stood, wrapping a robe around myself, and pushed him away coldly.

""Still throwing tantrums?"" he asked, grabbing my wrist. ""Cecilia's nothing. It's over.""

I caught sight of the lipstick smudged on his collar and wrenched my hand free.

""It's not a tantrum. It's disgusting.

""Your taste, Augustine, is as cheap as the perfume Cecilia drowns herself in. It's revolting.""

The next day, for the first time, we didn't attend the Las Vegas jewelry auction together.

Augustine showed up with Cecilia on his arm, stealing the spotlight the moment they walked in.

When I entered the hall, I overheard him introducing Cecilia to the investors as his woman.

Someone spotted me and greeted, ""Mrs. Clayton!""

""Well, if it isn't Mrs. Clayton,"" Cecilia mocked, her tone sugary and cruel. ""That dress looks a little... modest for the occasion, doesn't it?""

I lifted my hand slightly, revealing the emerald ring that symbolized my status as Augustine's wife. ""What I wear doesn't matter,"" I said coolly. ""What matters is that everyone here knows exactly who Mrs. Clayton is.

""Men like to have their fun sometimes. Ms. Webster, not everyone has your... devotion—content to be a mistress for life.""

Onstage, the host invited Augustine and his wife to unveil the centerpiece.

Augustine extended his hand toward me. ""Come on. Don't keep them waiting.""

His intent was obvious—to give me an easy way down and to show the world our marriage was still unshaken.

We unveiled the piece together and delivered our speeches—every move was flawless, every word in perfect harmony.

The soft golden lights traced the angles of his face, so familiar yet so distant.

The warm stage lights traced the mature lines of his profile, and for a moment, I was transported back eight years, to when we had first taken over a smuggling route together.

That night, after securing our first million-dollar deal, he had slipped this very ring onto my finger aboard a yacht.

I smiled and whispered, ""Mr. Clayton, what a wild ride through blood and flames.""

But the human heart, I realized, was far more unpredictable than any gamble in Las Vegas.


Chapter 4

I excused myself from the crowd, claiming I needed some air, and stepped out onto the terrace.

Cecilia followed me out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.

""Ms. Lambert,"" she called, voice dripping with challenge.

I turned, regarding her with cool detachment.

""Four years ago, the night you had your miscarriage, Augustine told you he was away on business,"" she spat, aiming to twist the knife. ""He was actually in my bed.""

I took a slow drag of my cigarette, exhaled, and met her gaze, calm as ever.

""I thought you'd have learned some tact by now,"" I said quietly.

Her eyes flashed. ""He loves me. He said he'd divorce you and marry me. He promised I'd have everything.""

I laughed. The sound came out low, amused, and almost pitying.

""He said that in bed, didn't he? That's his favorite place to make promises.""

I flicked ash off my cigarette. ""Every woman who's come to me has said the same thing. Tell me, what makes you any different?""

I stubbed out the cigarette and turned to leave.

But as I brushed past, she suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""The first time I stepped into his house, I knew you were just lucky,"" she spat. ""You and I came from the same dirt. Why you? Why did you get to be his wife?

""I'm younger. I'm prettier. I should've been the one!""

Her voice shook with anger and envy. ""Please, just divorce him! Let him go!""

I frowned and started to pull away. But suddenly, a deafening crash exploded from below.

The floor shuddered violently, and the terrace rail groaned and began to split.

By the time Augustine and his men rushed in, the terrace had cracked in two. Cecilia and I were stranded on opposite sides, the structure crumbling beneath us.

""Mr. Clayton, the structure won't hold!"" one of his men shouted. ""You've gotta save one first!""

A second collapse could hit any second; whoever got left behind was as good as dead.

Cecilia screamed, sobbing hysterically. My knuckles were white against the ledge.

""Augustine!"" I cried. ""The night I lost our baby—you swore you'd never hurt me again!""

It was all I had left to bargain with. Even if love was gone, maybe his guilt wasn't.

Augustine's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes darting in tortured hesitation.

Then Cecilia shrieked, ""Augustine! I'm pregnant with your child!""

His eyes widened. And in that instant, I knew.

""Save Cecilia first!"" he shouted.

I watched as they pulled her to safety, her tears shining in the chaos.

Then the stone beneath my hands gave way.

Weightlessness hit me like a punch—I plummeted downward, eyes squeezing shut in resignation.

I got it. Cecilia had his child growing inside her; I was just yesterday's flame. How could I compete?

Luck—or irony—saved me.

I crashed into a canopy, which broke my fall.

After a day and night lost to unconsciousness, the rescue team found me.

When I awoke, the media frenzy was in full swing.

The title read, ""Las Vegas Collapse Suspected as Rival Sabotage: Augustine Jets Off to Switzerland with Shaken Lover for Recuperation.""

In the photos, his arm was wrapped protectively around her waist. Their departure date was the same day I was wheeled into surgery.

It was just like when I lost our baby. I'd lain alone in that hospital bed too—abandoned, forgotten.

While Augustine was away, I recovered in silence, enjoying the rare peace.

His deputy kept sending over lavish gifts: orchids air-shipped from France and exquisite jewels that screamed opulence.

I threw every single one out.

When I was finally discharged, I went to my old house in North Las Vegas.

There, I burned everything Augustine had ever given me.

As I walked out of the alley, a black military jeep was parked at the corner.

Augustine stood beside it, watching me.

""Cecilia's pregnant,"" he said quietly.


Chapter 5

Augustine leaned against the hood of his black SUV, lit a cigar, and dropped the bombshell of his mistress's pregnancy.

I didn't flinch.

""According to the agreement, when we divorce, the assets are split sixty–forty. You take the forty."" My voice was steady, emotionless.

""My mother's made it clear—only you can be my wife,"" he continued, his tone smooth, calculated. ""You don't have to worry. Even if Cecilia gives birth, she'll never be allowed to outrank you.

""I can live without a mistress, Kassandra, but not without a wife who can fight alongside me.""

It hit me like a cold splash. He didn't want a divorce, but it was not because he loved me, but because I was still useful to him.

""So what?"" I said coldly. ""I'm not the one keeping you from your true love. It's your mother. If you've got a problem, take it up with her,"" I shot back icily, sidestepping him to walk away.

""My mom wants you at the Clayton's mansion in three days,"" he said behind me. ""Once Cecilia's baby is born, you will be that baby's mother.""

I didn't break stride, my heels clicking defiantly against the pavement.

That night, I took another car back to our villa in Summerlin.

The first thing I did was check my accounts. Several tens of millions of dollars sat quietly in them. A fortune by ordinary standards, but compared to Augustine's arms empire, it was barely a ripple.

They say when a man gains wealth, he loses his morals. And when a woman loses her morals, she gains wealth.

If I were truly heartless, I could've stayed—lived on as Mrs. Clayton in name and enjoyed the money, the diamonds, and the power.

But I was done living a lie. I didn't want to rot away in this gilded cage any longer.

That night, I bought a one-way ticket to Dubai.

I'd leave the moment the divorce papers were finalized.

Three days later, I arrived at the Clayton mansion for the meeting. The air inside was heavy with tension.

The argument revolved entirely around Cecilia—whether she, armed with her pregnancy, could claw her way into legitimacy.

Shelly's tone was firm. ""The child cannot stay. The heir of our family will not be born from a disgrace.""

Augustine tapped his fingers on the table, his voice low but steady. ""Once the baby is born, I'll announce to the public that it's Kassandra's. She can't have kids of her own—this fixes everything perfectly.""

""No,"" Shelly cut him off sharply.

I set down my teacup and said quietly, ""The night I miscarried, you swore you'd never have a child with another woman for as long as you lived.""

Augustine's reply came low and gravelly, laced with weary resignation. ""Kassandra, we can't keep chaining ourselves to old vows forever.""

Before I could respond, a car horn blared outside—the courier had arrived.

I went out to sign for the delivery.

Inside the envelope were two divorce certificates.

I took mine, slipped it neatly into my bag, and turned to go back in.

As I turned my head, I saw Cecilia standing there, eyes burning with hatred.

""Kassandra, I hate you! Why do they all protect you?"" She screamed, her voice shrill and shaking.

I ignored her and moved to pass, but she grabbed my wrist with surprising strength.

""I'll make sure he never looks at you again!"" She shouted, and before I could react, she snatched a fruit knife from the table and plunged it into her own abdomen.

Augustine and others came running at the sound. When they arrived, Cecilia was curled on the floor, blood soaking through her dress.

""Augustine... She tried to kill me... She wanted to kill our baby...""

She gasped, her voice weak but clear enough to condemn me.

""Kassandra!"" Augustine roared. He scooped Cecilia into his arms, his eyes blazing with fury.

I stood there, unmoved. ""If the baby's gone, she has no one to blame but herself.""

The next second, his hand struck my face.

The sharp crack echoed through the hall.

""You evil bitch,"" he hissed, his voice colder than steel. ""We'll settle this when I get back.""

With that, he carried Cecilia out. I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth and watched their car disappear into the distance.

Just then, my phone buzzed—a flight reminder. The plane to Los Angeles would be boarding soon.

Felicia approached quietly and gestured for me to check my messages.

A new text from her read, ""Sandra, I know that wasn't your doing. When you get to Dubai, contact this man. He runs a large arms business... and he's always admired you.""

I looked at the familiar name and number on the screen, then nodded slowly.

""Give this to Augustine,"" I said, handing her the copy of his divorce certificate.

""He's waited eight years for this moment. Tell him congratulations—from me.""

Then I picked up my suitcase and walked away without looking back.

I'd transfer in Los Angeles before heading to Dubai.

At the airport, I paused for a moment, watching the planes lift and vanish into the burning Nevada sky. Then I dialed the number Felicia had sent me.

A low, confident voice answered, warm with amusement. ""Long time no see, Sandra. When you land in Dubai, I'll be there to pick you up.""

""Alright,"" I replied softly.

I closed my eyes for a second, clutching my one-way ticket out of Las Vegas.

In my heart, I whispered, ""Augustine, we've tangled for eight long years.

""It's time I let you go... and set myself free.""

1p125e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/demonhatstories/comments/1p125e2/chapter_23_where_elisabeth_ended/,Chapter 23: Where Elisabeth Ended,"The corridor stretched before her, dim and silent, its shadows breathing with each hesitant step she took. Sue pressed forward, her body tense, until the living room opened up around her.

She stopped.

Her gaze locked onto the chaos that sprawled across the coffee table. A chicken carcass — stripped to its bones, greasy remains glistening under the pale lamp light. Potato skins clung stubbornly to a plate smeared with butter. An empty ice-cream pint slumped sideways, its cardboard walls stained. Chocolate wrappers lay torn and gutted, the silver foil catching light like discarded jewels.

Her eyes narrowed. Anger flickered there, raw and sharp.

She shifted her stare to the armchair — the deep imprint where a body had sunk too long, greasy fingerprints tattooed across the remote. Slippers abandoned on the carpet. The stench of indulgence hung in the air.

Sue's knees weakened; she sank into the chair. A wave of revulsion rose in her chest. *What a total lack of control… grotesque, pitiful.*

Her hand drifted nervously to her belly, then her thighs, pinching, kneading, as though the flesh itself had betrayed her. She hunched forward until her forehead nearly brushed her knees. Every reminder of Elisabeth — the weakness, the indulgence — gnawed at her. She was rotting from the inside out.

Abruptly, she seized the plate, her hands trembling, and fled the room.

In the dark belly of the trash can, the lid creaked open to reveal her face. She dropped the bones in, one by one, until the camera of her mind's eye was smothered under the rain of carcass and fat.

The secret room smelled of steel and antiseptic. Sue lowered the matrix carefully onto its side, her movements precise, almost ceremonial. The long needle pierced the flesh of her back, siphoning seven vials of essence. She didn't flinch. Her attention was elsewhere.

On the body. Elisabeth's body.

Her gaze traveled over the deformed finger, slick with grease. The scar that climbed her spine like a cruel vine. Flesh that sagged and folded, once supple but now flabby, used up. Each detail turned Sue's stomach. This body was not her ally; it was her cage. Her disgust sharpened into hatred.

\---

Palm trees stabbed upward, their emerald leaves slashing at the perfect blue of the sky. Sue strode down the street, phone pressed tight against her ear, her pace quick, jittery.

The line rang, shrill and unrelenting. Finally—

""Yes?""

Her voice erupted. ""This balance is not working!""

She pushed past strangers, eyes flicking desperately at each of them as though scavenging for reassurance.

""Why do we have to keep it even?!"" she demanded into the receiver. ""We don't have the same needs! I barely have time to breathe while *she*—"" her throat clenched with fury— ""she wastes days stuffing herself like an animal in front of the TV!""

A voice, calm, clinical, echoed through the line: *Remember, there is no she—*

Click.

Sue ended the call. Rage jolted through her arm; she wanted to smash the phone against the pavement, to hear it shatter. Instead, she clenched her jaw, swallowed the impulse whole, and kept walking.

The locker door creaked open. From its dark cavity, Sue emerged in fragments: a leg slipping into a leotard, fingers trembling as they zipped, a face clouded with unease. She caught her reflection in the dressing-room mirror. The mask of composure was cracking.

Backstage, her footsteps echoed down the empty hallway, hollow and steady, until she reached the studio door. She yanked it open, energy poised like a blade—

""Hello everybod—""

Silence.

The set was dead. No cameras, no lights, no audience. A single stagehand coiled cables, his movements methodical and unhurried.

Panic gripped her chest. ""What's happening? Where is everybody?""

""The taping's been cancelled,"" the man said without looking up.

""Cancelled?"" Her voice thinned to disbelief. ""Why?""

A voice behind her cut through the still air. ""Sue?""

She spun around, startled. A floor runner stood watching her, his face tight with seriousness.

""Harvey wants to see you. In his office. Now.""

Her pulse quickened. The studio seemed to tilt around her. ""I… I'll just go change and—""

""He said now.""

The words struck like a gavel.

Sue hesitated in the doorway, her pulse a wild hammer in her throat. Harvey's office stretched before her, polished and intimidating, its plate-glass window swallowing half the skyline. Sunlight blazed across the room, but the atmosphere was cold. His chair was turned away, facing the city, a looming silhouette that spoke of control. Only the broad leather backrest stared at her, silent and judging.

Three men in tailored suits occupied the office like watchful gargoyles. One reclined casually on the couch, legs crossed but eyes sharp. Another perched at the corner of Harvey's desk, arms folded, lips curved in the faintest smirk. The third stood sentinel by the window, a stiff figure framed against the sprawling metropolis. They all turned as she entered, their silence more suffocating than any interrogation.

Then Harvey swiveled.

His eyes—sharp, amused, predatory—locked onto hers. ""We've discovered your little secret,"" he said.

The words cracked through the room. Sue froze, her mouth dry.

""I couldn't believe my ears!"" Harvey leaned forward, savoring the moment, his gaze drilling into her. ""Elisabeth Sparkle?!""

Her heart lurched violently. She opened her mouth to protest, but he steamrolled her.

""You can't actually be living in…"" His lips twisted into a grin that was equal parts disbelief and menace. ""…Elisabeth Sparkle's apartment?""

Sue's face betrayed more than she wanted. Panic and confusion collided in her chest, but Harvey's voice filled the space, relentlessly.

""It's too much of a coincidence,"" he pressed on. ""I sack her and *bam*! Here she is again, trying to stick her foot right back in the door!"" He chuckled, low and bitter.

Relief swept through Sue like a tide breaking against rocks. *Only that.* He didn't know the *real* secret.

She forced a careful smile, steadying her voice. ""Uh… yes. We briefly met when she was moving out of town. She asked if I was looking for a place to rent… which I was, so… there you have it.""

The lie hung in the air.

Harvey squinted. ""Oh, she left town? Where did she go?""

Her stomach knotted. A beat passed. Then another. She could feel the men watching her like hawks.

""Uh…"" she stalled, ""…Costa Rica, I think.""

A silence followed, thick and suffocating.

Finally, the man on the desk—Suit #1—shrugged. ""It's great for taxes.""

Harvey grunted, eyebrows lifting, his approval oddly satisfied. Then, without warning, he slammed both hands on the desk, the sound echoing like a gunshot.

""ANYWAY! That's not why I wanted to see you."" His tone shifted, slicing through the room like a blade. His eyes narrowed, serious now. ""I'm going to get straight to the point: we can't keep you on the morning show.""

Sue's breath caught. The words felt like a fist to the chest.

""But why?"" she gasped.

""Ratings,"" Harvey cut her off, his grin returning, ""are through the roof.""

Her confusion deepened. A beat of silence passed, heavy, until Harvey gestured at one of the men.

""Two-sixteen,"" Suit #2 recited smoothly.

Harvey spread his arms wide, triumphant. ""That's phenomenal. We've *never* seen numbers like this in the history of the network! People love you, Sue. They *adore* you!""

The floor tilted beneath her. Emotion surged—fear, disbelief, relief, all tumbling over one another.

""That's why,"" Harvey continued, savoring the dramatic pause, ""we've decided we want you to host… the New Year's Eve Show.""

The words fell like a bomb.

Sue blinked. ""…you mean… The—""

""The network's biggest show."" Harvey's eyes glittered, almost feverish. ""Fifty million viewers. *Live.* You can't get any higher."" He gave a strange, glassy smile, lifting his hand toward the ceiling. ""Well, except if you die… then you'd go…"" His voice trailed into a strange metaphysical musing before snapping back into focus. ""Anyway. I'm taking a huge gamble on you. These men can tell you—I fought for this. I sold the shareholders until my last drop of saliva ran dry. This is the way forward. It'll be intense. We have only a few months to pull it off. But I know we can do it.""

He leaned forward, his stare pinning her in place. ""So? What do you say?""

The silence returned, humming in her ears. Sue's chest rose and fell, her eyes glimmering with a mix of fear and awe.

""Are you in?"" Harvey asked, voice low, commanding.

Her answer trembled inside her, unspoken but alive in her gleaming eyes.

Grandma ain’t making pancakes for us","I have 3 circuits in my kitchen prepping area. One for fridge, one for dishwasher and 2 duplexes are on the third. I don’t know the amps to any of the circuits nor do I know the wattage to my appliances. What I do know and recently found out is that I can use multiple appliances , but there are certain combos that will overload and trip. I don’t cook much so when I do, it’s a real freaking pain to have to run downstairs and flip the breaker and figure out what I need to unplug or leave alone. I gotta drag my coffee pot to the other side of the room and the griddle with half cooked pancakes is hot and ends up near the dog area. So I’m flipping pancakes with my dog at my feet licking his balls. The pancakes start to resemble ball sacks. I love my grandkids, but I’m not doing pancakes next time. 
Do the microwave and toaster oven each need their own dedicated circuit? I’m not using the dishwasher so that circuit is available. The toaster oven is a hog but I would I assume the 15 or 20 amp from dishwasher would be ok? I’m handy, but electricity makes me nervous. I don’t wanna mess with any wires cuz previous owner did a lot of weird electrical stuff with switches and strange wires and something half ass in garage resulted in my live chain link fence that went unnoticed until I was shocked. There are like six neighbor’s all connected so it would travel I think. So, I’ll call a professional, but as a widow I’ve been a target so I like to be informed and get some idea of what I might need so I can tell when they try to talk me into something that’s not necessary.

Quick background: In my family runs a genetic disorder, Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD). After the birth of our daughter (2.5yo), I found out I have it as well. there is a 1/2 chance to pass it along to my offspring.  
In short, PKD causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in your kidneys. PKD cysts can change the shape of the kidneys, making them much larger, in the end leading to kidney failure. There aren’t really medications that stop the cysts from growing, but you can slow things down through a healthy lifestyle.

My nephrologist told me that by Preimplantation Genetic Testing (a form of IVF), fertilized eggs can be checked for the disorder and only healthy embryos are placed back into the womb. So my wife and I decided to start the process. We have our first appointment with the genetics department sometime in December.

My wife has a poor relationship with her mother, not with her father. She blames her mother for not being supportive enough and available during her childhood and other things. They talk/share on basic things, but only the strictly necessary and socially required things. We go to birthdays and family gatherings like Christmas, but she won’t just drop by her mom’s house or let our daughter stay there alone. Her mother is trying to rebuild the relationship, but not succeeding.

st week, I was at my in-laws’ place helping with something, and afterward we (MIL, FIL, and I) were having coffee and chatting about everyday things. At some point, we started talking about my kidney check-ups. I told them how things were going and mentioned that we had decided to go ahead with the IVF procedure.

Yesterday, my wife got a text from her mother asking if we’d already started the procedures, like taking hormones, etc. I’m sure she meant well and was trying to be supportive.  
Now my wife is angry with me for telling them. She told me she didn’t want her parents (especially her mom) to know. She never told me that before.

I am a person who is quite open about personal things to family and friends when asked for, so honestly, I did not give it a second thought to keep it a secret and just told them. Especially as we were discussing my last results and situation.   
Furthermore, and I recognise this is a big mistake from my side, I did not tell my wife I had told her parents. Not because I was hiding anything, but because I didn’t think it would matter.

So, AITA for telling my MIL we will start an IVF procedure to get our second child?",4,1763540334.0,AmItheAsshole,23,0.7,False
