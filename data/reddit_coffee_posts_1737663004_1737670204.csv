It’s of a creator who parodies bubbly LA-style influencers — and the video is from the POV of a friend her serves her a coffee. She realizes the coffee is real milk instead of oat milk and freaks out as though she’s been poisoned — quite memorably growling the phrase “You f*ck*ng b*tch!” at her friend.

If it helps, I think this is the creator who also used to say catch phrases like “It’s gorgeous-o!” in a high-pitched voice.

1i8ffu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1i8ffu3/spaced_repetition_study_area_advice/,Spaced Repetition & Study Area Advice,"What is the best way to apply spaced repetition? I’ve finished the TTP course and are currently in revision mode. 

I’ve gone through (as in reviewed) 12 of the total 41 chapters of TTP. The approach I took:

1. Review Must Knows 
2. Elaborate on ideas that I’m unable to envision/grasp by writing down examples.
3. Going through the easy to hard level tests for each chapter and building my error log alongside it.
4. Completing reinforcement tests and sometimes creating custom tests.
5. I also try to do a 10 random question drill (random from any chapter and difficulty) or more everyday when I’m taking a break from chapters that I’ve planned to focus on. This is using the Manhattan prep app.

I planned to review the chapters I’ve covered each month in the last week of each month. Like the whole last week I plan to just focus on going through a fire drill of a bunch of questions. Perhaps that’s too many days? Any advice here?

I’m wondering having gone through the 12 chapters so far, how can I go about reviewing those chapters in way that I’m strengthening my weak areas and not just purely skimming through revision or not optimizing my review week. What is the best way to review at the end of each month?

I was planning on doing the revision test the TTP provides with the key chapters where you need to score a minimum of 75% and above as well as creating custom tests. But is there anything else I can do? I feel like if I go through my error log (which is quite long) I’ll overwhelm/overload my brain with information. What is the most effective approach of revision of a compiled version chapters?

So far in the round with magic loop I've been able to complete 4 rows of ribbing plus 2 more rows of knitting in the cream yarn that I'm using as my main colour. Now, the grid pattern tells me to knit 3 cream stitches, then 3 green stitches, repeating that pattern twice more. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how and/or when to add the green--at the beginning of the row?? midway through?? It's much easier to change colours in crochet!

1i8fe3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smallville/comments/1i8fe3o/s2e20_witness_jokos_ramblings/,S2E20  - Witness (JOKO's RAMBLINGS),"**Summary**

There are shenanigans afoot in Smallville after a van is robbed. Turns out, a local baseball player and his two, mute friends are using it to make inhalable steroids that give them super strength. Where did they get the meteor rocks that they were using up to this point to refine their product? Who cares! We're talking about THIS robbery. Clark has to fight them. Lana has to fight her step-mom. Chloe has to fight teen angst and the Luthors. Chaos ensues..

**Production Notes**

Clark drops the ball with Chloe, as he promised to provide a riveting story about the debate team for the Torch. Clark dismisses her concerns, but he's kind of a dick here. Meet your obligations, man. Not cool, Superman.

We abruptly cut to three guys in alien masks on a dark road as they appear to hijack a van. Clark appears and attempts to stop them, and he gets just totally wrecked, launching into a nearby fence. A quick x-ray scan indicates they have some weird metal plate in their head. That and a quick glimpse of a... school ring (?) are our only clues as to who these guys are. Clearly these guys are evil because only evil people buy class rings.

SOMEBODYSAAAAVE MEEEEEE

Clark thinks the kid goes to his school and starts x-raying everyone around him, presumably increasing the rates of cancer for everyone. Wait wait wait... what did I just read? Mark Verheiden was a producer on this? Wait... (checks notes)... he produced a lot of these episodes? The dude responsible for Time Cop, the seminal JCVD action flick of its time?! Why was I not told of this???

(2 hours later)

Ok, I'm back... sorry. Had to go watch Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mia Sara. Andy Garcia is great. Where were we...

Lana appears to be in a good mood, and Pete thinks it might be because of getting close with Clark. But, Clark spies the kid with the plate in his head... and it's the old kid from Home Improvement, Zachary Ty Bryan. Didn't this guy end up as a bit-part bully in a few shows? I think he even played essentially this same character in a Fast and Furious movie. Course, then his personal life hit the crapper. Maybe he took these parts to heart.

And, we see what Lex is up to... and Lionel is here! Everything is better with more Lionel. He's come to talk about Lex's engagement. No, wait, the white pedo van that was robbed was Lionel's? What was in that thing? Lex and I want to know the same thing. John Glover is so good in this show. He effortlessly improves every scene he's in.

Clark is cleaning out his Torch desk... and though he's harsh to Chloe, this time it's Chloe that is being unreasonable. Clark makes a valid point when he says Chloe looks like a sick puppy dog every time she sees him with Lana. Drama drama drama.

Clark follows Zachary Ty Crime-ing and discovers that he did - in fact - rob the truck. There was meteor rock in it, and his gang is using it to make drugs... which he then pops in an inhaler and takes hits of. Given the canonical effect Lex Luthor's comic book ring has on him (pretty sure it irradiates his hand and makes it fall off), breathing this stuff in on the regular can't be good for your health. And the Surgeon General says vaping is a menace.

So, the gang catches Clark and JESUS CHRIST THEY JUST THROW HIM IN THE FURNACE TO BURN ALIVE. Harsh. Fortunately, it just burns off all his clothes and he's able to bust out (ah 2000s CW... gratuitous half-butt shot).

Instead of directly calling the cops, the Kents plant evidence in the kids locker (I think? It's not clear if this guy was dumb enough to just leave the alien mask there or not), and tip off the cops... which is essentially the same thing, isn't it? Well, Clark watches as Eric is arrested, so that pretty much gives his secret - or SOME secret - away. Not sure how he can explain how he escaped from a blast furnace. But, here we are...

So, Chloe and Lana are talking about Clark (shocking, I know), and Lana sees her (real) father's wife making time with some dude at a coffee shop...? Oh, wait, it's her divorce attorney. And, she shows up at the Talon and BLAMES LANA FOR HER DIVORCE?! What kinda bitch is this? This lady has had 24 seconds of screen time in this entire series, and I hate her more than Lionel.

Well... the Torch has been trashed - likely at the request of Lionel to make a point to Chloe to stay out of his business - and Lex made a deal with Eric to get him out of jail in exchange for telling Lex what was in the truck. Eric and Clark do some light foreplay in the hallway, and Eric threatens Clark's parents since he knows Clark is 'unbreakable.' Ooooo... so he says he doesn't know how Clark got out of the furnace, but he knows he's unnaturally invulnerable. And... wait, Lex knows Clark put Eric away, right? Kinda a d-bag move to then let the guy out.

Yeesh, and this guy wasn't just threatening. He already went by the farm and strung up Clark's parents like a Banksy. I'm not sure how I would have written this up were I working on this show, but this goofiness isn't it. Clark helps them out and cleans up, successfully talking his dad into leaving town for a few days. The scene ends and Clark looks pretty pissed.

Whew, well we now learn that Lex didn't know Clark was the one that turned in Eric. At least, Lex is a bit redeemed here. Lex sets up an ambush by leaking that a truck of meteor rocks will be on the move. We head to a night time view of a LutherCorp plant (where the 'Luthorcorp"" letters on the roof look like a soft breeze will bring them crashing on to the trucks below), And, Clark knocks out Lex! Oof,,, lead-on-lead violence is rare on this show.

Eric's got the van, but Clark busts out the back. And, we are witness to a couple more fantastic action shots of underpaid stunt men being thrown 40 feet through windows. Clark is surrounded, but this is clearly where he pulls out one of his other abilities, right?

Yup, heat vision and super speed. This, coupled with Eric already admitting he knows (part of) Clark's secret means that this guy has to get killed off, I presume.

Hahaha, Clark enlists Pete's help to bury the meteor rock bars... which I find hilarious. Clark returns to Lex and has to pretend he has no idea what happened. Eric is awake but not talking (?), which I find to be total horseshit. The kid was facing a couple felony charges before and jumped on the Lex badnwagon. Why would he clam up now? Lex says he believes he knows who has the rocks, but I suppose we are to assume that he thinks it is Lionel and not Clark.

Lana tells her father about what his asshole wife said to her (filtered, of course), and advises him to work on his marriage before spending more time with her. This has got to just be a way to pause this storyline for a bit, which I support. I don't actually recall them ever picking it back up, but it's been 20+ years.

We are still in the Building Phase of the Clana relationship, so I'm ok with all this heavy drama, but I also recall how bad this gets several seasons from now.

Lionel offers to rebuild Chloe's Torch, but he destroyed it. Didn't he? Beats me, but maybe that means we won't have the colorful Apples iMacs anymore. Anywho, this is an evil, burgeoning relationship. The Media in bed with Big Business. A tale as old as time...

**Superman Mythos**

Kryptonite makes a comeback... breathing it after smelting apparently makes you strong. I don't think this show has ever analyzed why rocks from Clark's home planet make him sick... and everyone else a supervillain. I would think the Kents have several dinner conversations about how F'd up Krypton must have been.

**Notable Guest Stars**

Zachary Ty Bryan (as Eric Marsh) - So, I enjoyed Home Improvement back in the day. It was fairly solid sit-com fare. The parents were the stars, though. The kids just there to move along storylines. But, older son Brad was the more stable of the three. Too bad the actor turned out to be such a disaster as an adult. Multiple arrests for domestic battery. A slew of other charges, including being a bad actor. He's 'given up' on Hollywood, but I feel like Hollywood wants nothing to do with him anyway..

**Villain rating**

Eric Marsh (no direct comic analogue)

Threat level ★★★☆☆

Casting ★☆☆☆☆

Overall ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆

Look, I enjoyed Home Improvement, but this guy can't act his way out of a paper bag. He makes this villain appear minimally threatening when he should be much more ominous. Someone that can compete with Clark on the strength front AND weakens him when he's around? Sounds like a pretty real threat. But, you never feel like he has a chance, and you're just waiting on Clark to get fed up enough to bring down the hammer..

1i8fdho,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i8fdho/my_25f_ex_26m_tried_moving_into_my_building_and/,My (25F) ex (26M) tried moving into my building and now showed up in my hometown. Is it all a harmless coincidence or something weirder?,"I broke up with my ex around a year and a half ago. I initiated the breakup since we were long distance for 2 years, and felt increasingly uncomfortable with his growing independence toward me.

Some important background: He is from the East Coast - grew up and went to college there but had an incident in 2020 being publicly accused for sexual assault and was cut off by a lot of his friends. A girl made a public statement on social media saying that he touched her while they were both drunk. Before the statement was posted, he apologized to her and reached out to talk to her but she understandably did not accept any of his efforts. It left on this note, and we were just starting to date when this was all going down. He seemed very heartfelt and genuine about it and was very clear and transparent with me while explaining what happened so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

This whole incident made him very anxious being in public and meeting new people. The few friends he did have moved to other cities. I was his only outlet and source of comfort during our relationship and it eventually overwhelmed me. An example: I wouldn't contact him for a few hours throughout the day and he would later call me at night saying how his day can be good or bad depending on how much I contact him. It bothered me how he had no friends, and didn't make an effort to reach out to the ones that did stick around after all that went down. He also had a lot of aspirations that he never really took any action on.

Over the years, I would help him lay out timelines, study plans, social media plans - designing logos for his business and taking pictures for it, or buying him coffee or suggesting to go to the library to do work together. He'd be really motivated for a week or two but never make an real progress. I stayed throughout all this because despite him being like this, he was really driven to do better and work hard. But eventually this really bothered me after how much I was trying to help him so it was another reason why I wanted to break up. He had plans on moving to my city, so I initiated the breakup before he officially moved so that if he ended up moving here (or somewhere else) it would be a fresh start for him and I could move on comfortably knowing he didn't move here just for me.

We broke up- ended on OK terms, he understood why I wanted to break up. He didn't want to but respected my decision. I later found out he was still moving to my city (NYC). This wasn't a shock since a LOT of young professionals move here, and the few friends he had that I mentioned lived here and I even mentioned to him it might be good for him to experience the grind culture.

I still had a few of his belongings, including his old phone which I was using since mine broke a few months prior. This phone still had all socials logged in, which I didn't bother looking at while we were dating. However, since we broke up I was like why the hell not - I was curious about his plans and what he was going to do here.

I found out that he was trying to move into my building. He was looking at units IN MY BUILDING and around my area (a very specific neighborhood in NYC outside Manhattan) and was touring with another guy to try to rent out a 2 bed in this neighborhood. A lot of people my age and demographic live in this neighborhood, but personally I wouldn't try to move into a neighborhood I knew that my ex lived in especially in NYC where you could literally move anywhere else. I was a little creeped out, but just convinced myself it was a coincidence.

Fast forward to now, I'm happily dating someone new. Here and there, I hear that my friends have spotted him in the neighborhood and he's living in a building 2 blocks from me. I try to disregard it but am annoyed that I have to deal with possibly running into him. Perhaps unrelated, but once a girl he was talking to found my roommate at a party and was trying to see if I would be willing to talk to her and be her ""friend"" saying things like I'm so gorgeous and how pretty I am. Then proceeds to ask my roommate ""who's prettier? me or OP?"". This really annoyed me, I had no idea who this girl is and am really annoyed that this guy is still involved in my life somehow.

The incident that prompted this post was a few days ago. I am in my hometown, somewhere in CA. It's not a small or unknown city, but it's not one where people would immediately think of going to vacation for unless you live here, especially if you're from the East Coast. I'm here with my current boyfriend who is staying with me at my parents' home for the first time. We are also here with a few other friends who are from here.

All of a sudden, I see him at a mall. Just standing there. My friend, who knows my ex, nudges me and says ""there's no way.. that's him right?"". I've been paranoid to go anywhere in my own hometown since then. I think he is here with friends, I'm still mutuals with his friends that I mentioned before and saw them post about being in CA. The friends are avid travelers, so I didn't think too much about seeing that but I put two and two together and realized he must be here with them. He has no family here. One of his close friends' girlfriend's family lives in my hometown, but that friend and his girlfriend moved to a different city a while ago. I was so confused because he never would travel with them previously, and throughout the year and a half we broke up I never saw him on their social media or traveling with them.

Am I overthinking it? Honestly, I don't think he would be following me around. I'm just so confused and find it weird that he is OK with like being in his ex's hometown, where my family lives and where he used to stay during visits. I told my friend, and she thinks that it could be one crazy coincidence. I don't know what to think of it, i'm not sure if its creepy or if I'm being immature, but with everything that's happened previously like with him moving to NYC after breaking up, trying to move into my building, etc I can't help but be a little anxious. More than that I'm really annoyed that he would be here. Wouldn't you like.. not want to vacation in your ex's hometown? He's only been here with me in the past, maybe once to visit his friend who was staying with his girlfriend's family before.

Am I paranoid? Is it valid that i'm annoyed? Is he being creepy??",1,1737669745.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1i8fcrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i8fcrg/heartbroken_for_my_son/,Heartbroken 💔 for my son.,"This could be a long post, but I need advice from your followers. I have watched your videos and love the way you deal with serious situations with a carefree and humorous attitude. I (55f) and my husband (55m) have been married for 27 years and have two sons together. We'll call our oldest son Ty (27m). This post is directly about him, so I won't include our youngest. Ty moved to Texas in 2017 with some friends and tried to find some job opportunities. He lived there for two years but decided that it wasn't working for him and decided to move back home to NC in summer 2019. While he was living in Texas, he met someone at a ComiCon in Dallas. We'll call her Amy (28f). She was a traveling nurse working in Utah at the time. They hit it off and kept in touch. After about a year, she was diagnosed with leukemia. She was diagnosed as a child and it came back. She had to quit her job and move back in with her mother in Florida. Ty still kept in touch, and they had grown very close and even though it was over a long distance, they talked almost every day. She came to visit a couple of times over that period, but I already knew that my son was totally in love with her. He told me that he would follow her anywhere she decided to go. 💖 Then one night while we were watching TV, he came over and told us what Amy's living conditions were at her mother's house. Now, she is trying to recover from chemo treatment and was living in a closet under the stairs like Harry Potter. The reason for this was that both of her older brothers, their wives....and children had moved in also. There was literally no room for her. She ended up being the family maid and free babysitter. I was horrified that her mother would  treat her this way, but I also understand that not everyone has a happy family history. I told my son to ask if she wanted to come live with us, but I wanted him to also let her know that there would be no hard feelings if she said no. She didn't really know us and we didn't know her, but we wanted to at least offer her an option. I told him that they could both move back in and save some money until they found a place they could afford. Now, my husband and I are not independently wealthy. We own a modest 3brm, 2bth home in the suburbs of a well known coastal city. We basically live paycheck to paycheck, put money into our retirement and savings, but we have nothing extra. But because I knew my son was in love with this girl, I wanted to help them in any way I could. So, a couple of months later, he flies down to get her, packs everything they can into her small compact car and drives her here. They lived with us for almost a year before they found an apartment about 10 minutes away. Now during that time, Amy was trying to find a remote job in health care. Covid was still a thing and her immune system was compromised, so she had to be careful. She has a masters degree and was able to find a job making over six figures. I was very happy for her. She had worked so hard for her degrees without any support from her parents. Now, I won't lie, I was happy for my son also. He never went to college, but part of me was happy that they wouldn't have to struggle like we did. During the time they lived with us, they got engaged. I was over the moon happy! My husband and I eloped so we never had a traditional wedding, so I was secretly hoping that she would want to include me in some of that. 
I never charged either one of them a dollar of rent, or made them pay for food. They sometimes bought their own food, and sometimes they would cook for us, but I never once mentioned money to them. 
After they moved out, I was so happy for them. We gave them our sectional we had in our living room, the furniture that was in the bedroom and some barstools that we had. Things were going smoothly that first year they moved out. Amy and I would go shopping for things they needed for their apartment. We bonded over coffee, lunches, wedding plans, and some Ulta shopping. I considered her my daughter and she called me Mom. Ty and Amy would come to all our family functions and really seemed to enjoy those times with our family. (Her family is in Louisiana).Then something changed she stopped coming to our family dinners and holidays. She would say she wasn't feeling well, and I really didn't think much of it because she was recovering from cancer. Seems like anyone would be able to get a free pass for that. Her grandmother passed away and she traveled to Louisiana a couple of times to settle her property because her grandmother left the property to her instead of her mother. (Insert family drama here). She sold the property and it was enough that her and Ty could purchase a house. But there was no mention of house hunting, and I never pushed the issue or asked about it. They also decided to postpone a wedding because Amy wanted to go back to school to get her doctorate. She was working about 60 hours a week at this time, so I understood that it was a lot and offered to help where I could. Time went on and again there was no further mention of wedding plans after that. Her grandfather got really sick this past September so she traveled down to Louisiana to help with his health and find a home health nurse to be with him. We'll, she hasn't come back.....and it's January. After the first month, it seemed fine. She told me that she was enjoying spending time with her extended family, which is understandable. She doesn't have family here and even though we have accepted her and treat her like family, it isn't the same. After the second month I called Ty and asked what is going on. He filled me in on a bit of information. She had asthma and was blaming him for the diagnosis. A little backstory is he is a smoker and was when they met. He never smoked in there apartment and was trying to quit. He finally quit a few months before she left in September. But....she said he didn't quit ""fast enough"". Recently she texted me and said that the doctor found a small stage 1 tumor on her lung. Luckily with therapy, it should clear up in about six months. 
I don't know what to believe at this point. She hasn't actually called and spoken to my son since before Christmas. She will only text me even though I tell her that I want to hear her voice. How do I even know that it's her texting me? I've asked for an address to send her Christmas presents to and she never answers. She just ignores the question. When I try to call her, the phone never rings. It goes straight to voice mail. My son doesn't even know where she is. He's never met her family. We have no addresses or other phone numbers to call. 
My son is completely devastated. Oh, and their lease on the apartment is up at the end of February and she has told me that she's coming back to get her stuff and then moving permanently to Louisiana to be around her family. He can't afford the rent at the apartment on his own and will be forced to move back in with us until he can save money and find a roommate. 
I haven't told anyone but my husband and my other son about the situation. My whole extended family will be so devastated. They all loved her. How do I help my son through this and how do I heal my heart after loosing a daughter? 💔 ",2,1737669694.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I have a career in Industrial design, but hate most of the industry. I'm a creative problem solver that loves people and has a very artsy background (gifted and talented kids hollah) which in college was all you needed. I'm realizing I hate sitting at a desk, and I struggle with the stupidity of leadership (strong black and white thinking and justice). I'm thinking about going back to school for MRI technologist. I sat down awhile ago and went through all the jobs I've ever had and found that working as a Barista was my favorite job because I was always busy, always on my feet, clear direction of job duties, plus the people were just great overall (customers and coworkers) and I do like coffee. I recognize MRI is very different from that, but it has a lot of those core tennents from what I hear online, plus I learn something totally out of my scope and  use my pattern recognition and 3D mental skills.  Does anyone with ADHd have experience in this field/wider medical field in general that could have some insight?

1i8f8e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ascaso/comments/1i8f8e4/ascaso_duo_steel_temperature_offsetheat_up_time/,Ascaso Duo Steel - Temperature offset/Heat up time measurement with scace,"Hi!

Second time i try to post this, my text was missing.

I just want to share my experience with **temperature offset and heat up time** and want to hear your experience! It is my first espresso machine. I have had the machine since the beginning of december. Therefore i had no experience with heat up times, and i am really not able to guess temperature by taste.

I only red this article about the machine from the kaffeemacher in which they show a heat up protocol and talk about temperature offset. Their testing machine has a consistent brew temperature of 93 degree in 8,3 minutes at the second shot. (Btw. they said in the article that the machine is up to operating temperature after 5 minutes, but in their heat up protocol it is 8.3)

My main problem in espresso making is inconsistency in shot times. I do the same routine and get different shot times and sometimes even if the shot times are ""good"", the espresso tastes like crap.

Therefore i wanted to really know my temperature, because this was a thing i could only guess.  
So I rented a scace thermometer so that the temperature is no longer a black box to me

**Testing heat up time**

I started pulling shots after the machine indicated that the thermoblock reached the temperature. I pulled shots with 30 seconds at intervals of 1 to 2 minutes.  
At shot number 9 and 15.6 minutes i constantly hit the 93 degree that i have set on the machine. I attached the diagram.

**This is the outcome for me:**  
\- Offset 3 Degrees  
\- Heatup time: Way longer than i thought. I have probably gotten the wrong idea about heat up time from the many reviews that say a thermoblock heats up so fast compared to boiler maschines. In the future i will start pulling shots after the machine was on for at least 10-15 minutes the make the portafilter and group head really hot.  
\- Pressure was out of the box at 9.6 bar, i adjusted it to exactly 9 with the scace as indicator.  
\- My last shots are way more consistent but i only pulled 5 shots since i wait longer before starting. I think i brew a lot of coffee with low temperature and very different low temperatures...

But to be honest, the espresso still doesn't really taste as good as in the local coffee, even with the same beans they use there. Guess this will be a long journey.

**Your experience?**

\- Why even buying a themoblock machine after that experience? Thought boiler machines also need 10-20 minuts heat up time?  
\- How long do you heat up the machine?  
\- Does temperature even affect shot time?

1i8f78v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1i8f78v/i_think_i_was_friend_zoned_for_the_first_time/,I think I was friend zoned for the first time?,"I was on Facebook dating seeking ""something casual"" because whenever I'd put seeking a relationship, guys would just send me a message immediately expecting to be going out every day, or they just wanted sex, or they would start talking about marriage. 

I prefer to get to know someone through messaging before I meet someone in person and I always add that I like to take things slow in my bio. This is partly for protection and partly for convenience because I'm busy.

I'm honestly very happily single and I'm tired of wasting my time dating. My previous relationships I jumped into really quickly so going slow is my preference. I know people are divided on ""we need to meet for a drink or coffee right away so we know if we vibe"" vs. not meeting for a while. I'm really good at getting an idea of a person without actually meeting them in person.

Anyway. Matched with this guy and we immediately connected over horror movies. We talked every day, all day long via text and voice messages for about 3 days. He lives three hours away but he said he was taking a road trip to my area that weekend and asked if I'd like to meet up so I said yes, which is unusual for me but I was digging him. It sounded like a date. So I started flirting with him a little and trying to get an idea of what he wanted to do. He said he was really excited to meet me and said he didn't want to look at my Instagram pictures so he could be surprised when he met me. He said he was really enjoying talking to me and couldn't wait to meet. Then one night I sent him a voice message with my retainer in and joked about it and my lisp. Then he said ""friends are allowed to give each other a hard time"" and that it was funny I talked to him with my retainer in. I was confused about the friends thing. I had told him previously about taking things slow but made it clear I was open to a relationship with the right person. I asked him outright if this hanging out was going to be friendship or a date and what he was thinking. He said it's friendship ands that he figured we would discuss being more when it got to that point. I honestly immediately pulled back. Now the messages are much fewer and kinda generic. This has never happened in my life. I've always been pursued and had to be the one to say if it was just friendship. I'm annoyed because we clicked right away and had so much in common. I don't like wasting my time on hanging out with a guy I'm attracted to if it's not gonna go anywhere. I don't really need another friendship. He seems oblivious to flirting, doesn't flirt back, but constantly brings up how much he enjoyed talking to me. I already feel like my time talking to him was wasted. I don't like being the one to pursue ever, but I actively tried in this situation. What a dud. Anyway, I deleted the app and now I'm just going back to not seeking anyone and just staying single. I don't know why I even tried. It's probably my fault for putting seeking casual but online dating is full of trash and it was the only way I found that eliminated the pushy guys. Except for the ones wanting fwb. I mean I would've even considered that with him but he literally would not respond to any flirting in any way and didn't even say anything about photos I sent(not sexual). Not even a single compliment on my appearance. It was out of the ordinary.",2,1737669304.0,dating,2,1.0,False

1i8f5vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1i8f5vh/unsure_how_to_take_recruiters_advice_in_ria/,Unsure how to take recruiter's advice in RIA interview? How do I not mess this up?,"I did a couple internships at JPMC while I was in university and just graduated. Those were on the corporate side, debt refinancing, M&A capacity, etc., and I had really wanted to join their Private Bank but the timing and location didn't work out. Recently, I had a pretty good screener interview with a recruiter for a competitive RIA in NYC (just under 30 people including support roles, if that matters), but to be perfectly honest I know very little about RIAs relative to bulge bracket private banks. And even then, I just graduated and haven't worked in PB/WM, what I know is only from a ton of coffee chats, not hands-on experience.

The recruiter told me they liked me and would send me on to the next step, which is interviewing with the team, but I'm really nervous. They told me to dress very professionally, ""because they're very old school wall-street,"" which was expected, but the description made me nervous. But they also implied I needed a stronger answer into where I see myself in the next 2-5 years, and why I want to work in wealth management and why an RIA. Here were the answers I gave,  I'm wondering what research I could do or what might have been not the strongest about these answers and how I could improve them:

1. Why wealth management? I've been a software engineer, worked in corporate banking, been a teacher - and the best job I ever had was being a waitress. I like people, I like the intimacy of working with individual (and family) wealth. Some people focus on philanthropy, some are focused on their legacy, etc. Working with executives in corporate banking is client-facing, but I don't think I'd feel like part of the whole story in the way I would in wealth management, nor would it have the same sort of service and intimacy. To me, wealth management seems like the intersection between the intellectual stimulation and technicality of the tech jobs I held with the intimacy and service I enjoyed so much in hospitality.

2. Where do I see myself in 2-5 years? If my experience has taught me anything, it's that things are rarely exactly what you picture when you get there. I have a stronger idea of where I want to go then concrete expectations of where I'm starting. I'd like to start in a role where I have the opportunity to be exposed to others deeper into their career and learn what they do and why. I want to learn financial planning and analysis. I want to work somewhere where, if I take the initiative, I have the opportunity to grow in the direction that best suits me and the firm. In the long run, I want to manage my own portfolio of clients and be a financial advisor. (I didn't want to say I eventually want to be a partner at a firm or start my own firm, because I assumed they're looking for someone who wants to stay)

3. Why an RIA? They didn't ask this directly but tbh, I don't know enough to know.

(a) allow the other person to be in the right headspace and not blindside it as a coffee date or whatever

(b) make sure they allow 1-2 hours+ of time to have whatever conversation/closure/etc and not have her schedule other plans 30 mins after

I feel like it’s considerate to give a warning over text that the conversation will be about it (if she wants to have it), but idk if that’s considerate and I’ve heard breaking up over text has negative connotations.

Or to give a full on body hug at the end unprompted. But to reaffirm a few times you'd like to go to xyz location when I offered just to turn around and be like ""you're so very sweet and kind, but I don't see it moving forward"" just stings.

I'm totally fine with not feeling it. Happens to some people, dating is a two way street. But to lead a guy on, I don't know, wouldn't recommend.

I would rather the person just told me at the end ""I think we're better off as friends or acquaintances, I am not feeling that spark"". Or just tell them you'll think about it instead of making initial plans for a second date and saying how much fun this one was, if you aren't entirely sure there will be a second date.

The owner of the coffeeshop i work at took a trip to Australia and came back raving about this cup and bought a handful for our shop that we now serve all of our pour overs in by default. 

The cup has 2 different lips, one side is straight and one side is flared, depending on which side you drink from the coffee tastes different. Like significantly different, it’s like having two different coffees in one cup. 

From their website site: 
“How to works: Our concept revolves around delivering the drink to different parts of your tongue, resulting in diverse drinking experiences. A narrower rim directs the drink to the front and middle of your tongue, yielding sweeter and more intense flavors with a heavier body. Meanwhile, the flared rim directs the drink to the rear of your tongue, spreading it wider, enhancing aroma, floral notes, and prolonging the aftertaste with a silkier body.” 

This cup has single handedly change the way i view the complexities of coffee notes and flavors. I was wondering if any of you have experienced this cup and what your thoughts are? I find the flared side to significantly more acidic. ",0,1737668859.0,barista,2,0.33,False

I just found SSD (super secret donuts) a few weeks back on Instagram too.

Does a non social media directory of business exist? If not, is it ridiculous to think we could manage one?  

Even like a giant google doc that could hold the info?

Might be overthinking it but I know I’m not alone with quitting social media.

I had wedge pillows plus 4 more pillows just to sleep at night. I would drink several cups of coffee per day and felt the espresso burning my esophagus even during the day. At night, times were so bad I had to stand up half asleep, and gobble some antacids. 

I was sick 3 weeks ago and decided to try stopping coffee. After the migraines for a few days, things got better. Within a week, I realized I'm not getting reflux or gerd. I took out the wedge pillow. Now I sleep totally normal. 

I'm not a saint however, I do have some chocolate which has low mounts of caffeine. But I'm eating whatever I want, and even having beer with no ill effects.

This is very tough because I loveeeer coffee and the ritual. The inspired chaotic moments that the caffeine gave me as a creative. But I guess I'll just have to sacrifice that for improved quality of life.

My wife is a foreigner, struggled to find a job in Germany. When she finally got one, we moved 7 hours away from my family. My wife and sister never liked each other much but tolerated one another.

Before our move, Alyson offered to take care of our cat. I thought it would simplify the move, and my wife didn't voice her disagreement at the time, but in hindsight, she never wanted Alyson to have the cat.

Shit hit the fan; our cat went missing at her house...

We drove back to help search, but the situation escalated. My wife believed my sister didn’t care enough and accused her in the family group chat. She also brought up my money my sister owed me (I am fine with that btw. I told her take your time), which I had lent her two years ago before.

My mom and other sister defended my sister, and my wife left the group, declaring she never wanted to see my family again. We did everything possible to find the cat: posters, cameras, and repeated trips back.

My sister was slow to install the cameras, and her delayed responses infuriated my wife.

A kind neighbor spotted the cat and lured her over a period of 9 days into her house.

We directly drove with her to that woman to get our cat.

This was after 8 hours of work a 6-hour ride and a 2 hour stay at their place to get our cat.

It was 1:00 o'clock already. So I drank some coffee to feel me awake. Also the adrenaline in hindsight made me feel awake. I fell asleep while driving my car! With my wife and cat in the car. This is unforgiving and please to everyone no mater what never drive sleepy even if you feel awake after a coffee! I have learned my lesson, and no one got hurt but the car was destroyed. (For this situation IATA, no discussion)

During Christmas, my wife brought up how my sister never apologized for not replying and not putting in enough effort for searching the cat. My grandma and mom got upset, saying it was everyone’s fault and that we should just be grateful the cat was found.

My sister was not there yet. When she arrived, my wife confronted her again about this topic.

My sister said she did everything she could, and she felt also bad about the whole situation, that's why she didn't dare to deliver no new news.

Sarah frequently criticizes my family and compares them to hers, claiming they’re better. She doesn’t want me visiting my family more than once a year and hates when I defend my family.

I’ve tried to stay neutral, mediating between Sarah and my family but her hate grows more and more against my sister.

Also, she hates that my family isn't willing to support buying an apartment, because her family wants to support.

The situation doesn't get better, and I don't know what to do...

The game has a prologue where you start out in the main characters apartment. You can look around and do a few things. You can crack your window, look at the news paper on the coffee table ect. The news paper headline is about the main character from the first game escaping. You leave and come back and your window is wide open with blood on the window sill. Even if you don't crack the window it will always be wide open with blood. Now you're in the car, I don't remember how or if it was explained why you're suddenly in trapped in the car. The main character remarks that she has to hurry and escape the car before they get back. After she says that there might have been something like a 5-10 minute timer to escape the car.

1i8etek,https://i.redd.it/0rt535l0ctee1.jpeg,The SkyLightZone: Part VI: The Eighth Bell.,"The Eighth Bell:

In a realm where time bends to the whims of unseen architects, the story does not end—it merely shifts, like the hands of a clock reluctant to mark the hour.



The clocktower workshop stood empty now, its gears grinding in a rhythm that no longer adhered to the laws of time. Echoes of the Maestro’s symphony lingered in the air, faint but insistent, like a melody half-remembered in a dream. But something stirred within the heart of the tower—something new, something old.



High above the workshop floor, a single bell swayed in its cradle, untouched by the Maestro's grand finale. It was the eighth bell, forged in secrecy and bound by whispers. Unlike the others, it had never rung. Its surface was smooth and dark, as if it absorbed the light rather than reflected it. Beneath its sheen lay inscriptions in a language no one alive could read.



And then, it rang.




Miles away, Nyx jolted awake in her bed, her chest heaving as if she had run for miles. The sound of the bell was faint, but it carried with it a resonance that made her bones ache. She turned to the mirror on her dresser, half-expecting to see her reflection moving independently again. But the glass was still.



Still... but not empty.



Behind her reflection stood a figure cloaked in shadow, its form indistinct yet unnervingly familiar. The figure tilted its head, mimicking her own movements.



""Nyx,"" it said, its voice layered with echoes of her own. ""It’s time.""



""Time for what?"" she whispered, her voice trembling.



The figure raised a hand and pointed—not at her, but at the mirror itself. ""To see what lies beyond the eighth bell.""



The Quantum Café was deserted when she arrived, save for Lyra, who stood behind the counter polishing a glass. The air was thick with the scent of coffee and something else—ozone, like the aftermath of a lightning strike.



""You heard it, didn’t you?"" Lyra asked without looking up.



""The bell,"" Nyx said. ""What does it mean?""



Lyra set the glass down and met her gaze. ""It means the Maestro’s work is not finished. The eighth bell is the key, but it doesn’t open doors. It opens... pathways.""



Nyx frowned. ""Pathways to where?""



Lyra’s smile was enigmatic, tinged with something that might have been pity. ""That depends on who you are when you walk through.""



Before Nyx could respond, the café shimmered and dissolved, leaving her standing once again in the clocktower workshop. The gears were still turning, but the air felt heavier, as if the tower itself were holding its breath.



The eighth bell loomed above her, its surface gleaming like liquid night. Beneath it stood a pedestal, and on the pedestal lay an object that seemed out of place in the mechanical chaos of the workshop: a single, weathered hourglass.




The figure from the mirror emerged from the shadows, its form coalescing into something almost—but not quite—human. Its face was a shifting mosaic of Nyx’s own features, as if it were trying on her identity like a mask.



""You’ve come far,"" it said, its voice a distorted harmony. ""But the journey isn’t over. The hourglass is your passage, and the eighth bell is your guide.""



Nyx hesitated. ""Why me? What is this place?""



The figure tilted its head, its expression unreadable. ""This place is the nexus of all possibilities. Every choice you’ve made, every path you didn’t take, they converge here. The Maestro built the tower to harness that power, but even he couldn’t unlock the eighth bell. Only you can.""



""Why me?"" she asked again, her voice rising.



""Because you are the anomaly,"" the figure replied. ""The thread that doesn’t fit. The question that was never answered.""


Nyx approached the hourglass, her hands trembling. 


As she lifted it from the pedestal, the eighth bell began to hum, its vibrations coursing through the tower like a living thing. The sand within the hourglass was unlike any she had seen—each grain shimmered with its own tiny universe, spinning and colliding in an endless dance.



""Turn it,"" the figure urged. ""Let the sands fall, and let the bell ring.""



With a deep breath, Nyx flipped the hourglass.



The first grain of sand struck the bottom, and the bell let out a low, resonant tone. The air around her fractured like glass, revealing glimpses of other worlds—some vibrant and teeming with life, others desolate and cold.



The figure stepped closer, its form dissolving into a cascade of reflections. ""Choose, Nyx. Which path will you walk? Which world will you call your own?""



As the last grain of sand fell, the eighth bell rang out with a sound that was both beautiful and terrifying. The tower shook, and the worlds around her began to collapse, folding in on themselves like pages in a book.



Nyx closed her eyes and stepped forward, her choice made.



When she opened them again, she was no longer in the clocktower. She stood in a place that defied description—a landscape of infinite horizons, where time and space wove together in a tapestry of light and shadow.



The figure was gone, but its voice lingered in her mind. ""Every choice is a beginning, Nyx. And every beginning is an end.""



And so, we leave Nyx, a wanderer in a realm where the boundaries of reality blur and the echoes of choice reverberate through eternity. In the shadow of the eighth bell, she has become more than a traveler—she is a question, an answer, and the space between.

She gratefully accepted and we chatted for a bit.  I offered to buy her something else and we then went to Sephora where I bought her and her friend some stuff. We traded numbers and I venmoed her $300 before leaving.

About 21 hours ago, I knocked over a mug of coffee (black, no sugar) from my windowsill right above my headphones, which were laying earcup-side up, so the coffee fell directly into the right earcup (and all over the wall). I instantly grabbed some paper towels and tried to blot them dry but figured I could leave them facing down and they might be okay.

In the morning, I looked up what to do and so I took off the earcup and cleaned the driver and plastic underneath with 99.9% ISO alcohol. A lot of people online suggest rice for headphones, but I always thought this was a myth so never considered it, is it too late now? Silica packs are a good idea but I have none and it would be too late by the time they arrive. Today I have rotated them from open air to lying on the radiator to having them facing the sun.

Here are my main questions: Is it safe to turn them on now? They have been off since the spill, they were off at the time of the spill thankfully (I hope). Should I try to charge them before turning them on or does the order not matter? If I shouldn't turn them on yet, when should I?

Finally: How screwed am I? Even if they do work, are they a ticking time bomb due to corrosion (not literally, I just mean will they die on me in the foreseeable).

I'm a graduated hairdresser/barber and I am currently studying history and archeology online. I love cinema and writing (actually finished a poetry collection a month back) and also read, draw and sing in my free time (although I suck big fat redacted at singing). I am also a feminist, I love coffee, LOTR and I would do anything for the people I love.

That brings us to you!

From you, I would hope you're a decent human being. I have had my fair share of man children and trauma. I think it's a fair ask. I also hope you are good at speaking English and can keep up with my wittiness. I don't mind if we don't share the same music taste or if you don't like going to museums and discussing knights — what matters most is that we get along and our values match.

I’m Miguel, a café owner and coffee roaster in France. Over the years, I’ve faced the same struggles many of you might know too well: overpriced, restrictive software solutions designed by people who don’t truly understand the realities of running a small business.


That’s where Tabello was born—out of necessity. We needed a better, affordable way to manage online orders for our café, so we developed our own in-house solution. After months of coding (between dirty dishes and customer orders) and real-world testing, we’ve built something that works.


But here’s the thing: Tabello isn’t ready for the public yet. Right now, it’s an in-house tool we’ve been refining for our own café. To make it available for others, we need to take this solution to the next level—to polish it, scale it, and make it commercially viable for cafés and restaurants everywhere.

Here’s what makes Tabello special:

✅ No monthly fees – You only pay when you make an online sale.

✅ All-inclusive services – Unlimited employees, locations, and menu items—no paid tiers or hidden fees.

✅ Built by peers – As café owners ourselves, we understand the struggles firsthand.

Most software in this space charges you for every little thing: per employee, location, or even a limited number of orders. As developers, we know this is just extra code to create artificial restrictions. It’s like paying a subscription to use your kettle, absurd, right?


🚀 Our Next Step:
We’re launching a crowdfunding campaign on Ulule to bring Tabello to the public. If you believe in empowering small businesses with affordable, accessible tools, we’d love your support. Together, we can create a future where cafés and restaurants can thrive without burdensome fees.


👉 [Check us out here: ](https://www.ulule.com/tabello)


We’re excited to take this next step and would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions about the journey so far. Thanks for reading, and let’s build something amazing together! ☕",1,1737667682.0,u_CoffeeMan392,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------

Gift cards have become a popular choice for gifting and personal use, offering a unique blend of flexibility and convenience.

### Flexibility and Choice

One of the most significant benefits of gift cards is the freedom they provide. When you give someone a gift card, you’re allowing them to choose what they truly want. This makes gift cards ideal for:

- Holidays
- Weddings
- Graduations
- Anniversaries
- Birthdays

Instead of guessing a person’s size or taste, you empower them to select their own gifts, ensuring that what you give will be used and appreciated.

### Simplicity of Purchase

Purchasing gift cards is incredibly easy. You can buy them online or in-store from a wide range of retailers. This saves you time and effort, especially during busy holiday seasons:

- Buy online from the comfort of your home.
- Choose digital or physical cards based on your preference.
- Set a specific dollar amount that fits your budget.

This straightforward approach makes gift cards a go-to solution for last-minute shopping or planning ahead.

### Budget-Friendly Gifting

When you give a gift, sticking to your budget is often a concern. Gift cards allow you to control your spending effectively:

- You can choose the amount you want to give.
- There’s no pressure to overspend on elaborate gifts.
- Gift cards can often be found on sale, allowing for potential savings.

This flexibility ensures that you can gift generously without breaking the bank.

### No Expiration Worries

Another benefit of gift cards is that many retailers have eliminated expiration dates. This means the recipient can take their time to choose and not feel rushed to spend the card. Moreover, this can reduce stress for you, knowing your gift won’t go to waste simply because it wasn’t used in time.

### Encourages Exploration

Gift cards also encourage individuals to explore new brands or services. For example:

- A bookstore gift card can inspire the exploration of different genres.
- Retail gift cards may introduce people to stylish shops they haven’t visited before.

Gifting a card can broaden a person’s horizons, making leisure time more exciting.

### Personal Enjoyment and Rewards

Using gift cards for personal use can be a delightful treat. They often serve as a way to splurge without guilt. Here’s how they’re beneficial:

- Using a gift card allows you to enjoy experiences you may have postponed.
- Some credit cards offer gift card rewards, letting you earn points while shopping.

This turns spending into an enjoyable experience rather than just a necessity.

About 21 hours ago, I knocked over a mug of coffee (black, no sugar) from my windowsill right above my headphones, which were laying earcup-side up, so the coffee fell directly into the right earcup (and all over the wall). I instantly grabbed some paper towels and tried to blot them dry but figured I could leave them facing down and they might be okay. 

  
In the morning, I looked up what to do and so I took off the earcup and cleaned the driver and plastic underneath with 99.9% ISO alcohol. A lot of people online suggest rice for headphones, but I always thought this was a myth so never considered it, is it too late now? Silica packs are a good idea but I have none and it would be too late by the time they arrive. Today I have rotated them from open air to lying on the radiator to having them facing the sun. 

  
Here are my main questions: Is it safe to turn them on now? They have been off since the spill, they were off at the time of the spill thankfully (I hope). Should I try to charge them before turning them on or does the order not matter? If I shouldn't turn them on yet, when should I?

  
Finally: How screwed am I? Even if they do work, are they a ticking time bomb due to corrosion (not literally, I just mean will they die on me in the foreseeable).

A barista at our favorite coffee shop—a sweet girl named Lily—always smiled at me when I ordered. Nothing inappropriate, just friendly. A week later, I saw a news report.

She’d been found dead in her apartment. Stabbed. No suspects.

Claire didn’t react much to the news, just took a sip of her coffee and said, “The world is full of terrible people.”

I agreed.

The second time, I noticed the pattern.

A woman at my gym—a trainer—offered to spot me. She laughed at one of my jokes, put her hand on my arm for half a second. That was it.

The next morning, she didn’t show up for work.

They found her body in a ditch two towns over.

I sat in stunned silence, staring at the headline, the hair on my arms standing up.

Claire hummed in the kitchen, making breakfast. She kissed my cheek when she brought me my plate. Eggs, bacon, toast. Just how I like it.

I told myself I was imagining things.

Then it happened again.

And again.

And now, I know the truth.

Claire isn’t jealous. She doesn’t accuse me of cheating, doesn’t go through my phone, doesn’t pick fights over things that don’t matter. She doesn’t cry or beg for my attention.

She just eliminates the competition.

And the worst part?

I’ve never told her to stop.

It’s not fear that keeps me silent.

It’s love.

Because Claire loves me more than anything. She wakes up early to make me breakfast. She runs her fingers through my hair when I’m tired. She remembers the little things—what shirt I wore on our first date, what song played during our wedding, how I like my coffee.

And I love her, too.

I love how she smiles when she reads, how she dances barefoot in the kitchen, how she reaches for my hand in her sleep.

I love all of her.

Even this part.

Even the part that leaves blood on her hands.

Tonight, we’re at a restaurant. A waitress—a young, bubbly girl—laughs at one of my jokes. She glances at me one second too long.

I glance at Claire.

She’s watching.

Her lips curve into a small, knowing smile.

She’s already decided.

And for the first time, I feel something unexpected.

Not fear.

Not disgust.

Just… curiosity.

Because I’ve spent all this time pretending I don’t know. Pretending I don’t see the signs, the subtle shifts in her voice when she asks about someone, the way her body relaxes when they disappear.

But what if I stopped pretending?

What if I let myself love all of her—the way she loves me?

I look at the waitress again.

Then, slowly, I take Claire’s hand across the table.

She tilts her head. Her eyes sparkle.

And she smiles.

Because this time, I’m smiling too.",81,1737667294.0,shortscarystories,5,1.0,False

1i8ecyl,https://i.redd.it/9l3n2gon8tee1.jpeg,The SkyLightZone: Part III: The Quantum Café.,"The Quantum Café.


In a corner of the universe where reality intertwines with the fabric of dreams, Nyx found herself once again in the quaint coffee shop, a portal between realms. But today, the air was electric with an unseen energy—a palpable tension, like the moments just before the first light of dawn. The barista, Lyra, seemed to glimmer under the warm glow of the café lights, as if she were a specter caught between worlds, embodying the duality of existence. Here in this twisted cortex of a reality we embarc upon a journey into the tapestry within the fabric of existence itself. A reversing compass within  the very vortexes which stitch together our reality: you're caught in The Skylight Zone--



“Welcome back, Nyx,” Lyra said, her voice laced with an enigmatic quality that hinted at secrets yet to unfold. “The universe has a way of bringing us together.”



Nyx felt a shiver run down her spine. “I can’t shake the feeling that something is different. Like I’m not just in a coffee shop, but in a crossroads of realities.”



“Ah, the concept of quantum entanglement,” Lyra replied, her eyes sparkling with understanding. “Two particles can be connected across vast distances, influencing each other instantaneously. We may be intertwined in ways we can’t yet comprehend.”



Across the room, Mr. Whiskers perched on a windowsill, his emerald eyes reflecting the light like two miniature mirrors. Nyx sensed that he held knowledge beyond her understanding—a guardian of the multiverse, perhaps, watching over the fragile threads of existence. “What is it, Mr. Whiskers?” she whispered, leaning toward him.



His gaze deepened, and in that moment, Nyx felt as though she were peering through a lens into a parallel universe, one where a family of gnomes was convening beneath the café’s foundation, engaged in their own cosmic discussions. “We’re all connected, you see,” the gnome named Thistle declared, his voice high and whimsical. “Each choice made in one universe resonates through the others, like ripples in a pond.”



With a mischievous grin, Thistle waved his tiny hands, conjuring an image of a mirrored mirror complex where realities folded into one another. Nyx was transfixed as the images danced before her—a glimpse into myriad lives lived in tandem. “Look! There’s you, and there’s another you, and another, and another,” he exclaimed, his voice a playful echo of infinity.



As Nyx turned her attention back to the café, the air thickened with the aroma of coffee and possibility. “What does it all mean?” she asked, her heart racing at the prospect of understanding her place in this vast tapestry of existence.



“It means you are both alive and dead in your choices, just like Schrödinger's cat,” Lyra said, her expression solemn yet illuminating. “Until you open the box, you are the sum of your possibilities—an explorer in a realm where every path is possible, yet none are fully realized.”



At that moment, the Nutcracker, a delicate figure of wood and imagination, appeared on the counter, dancing to the silent melody of her thoughts. Unlike the bright colors of her childhood, he was now draped in shadows, a reflection of the darker paths she had traversed. “I am the embodiment of your dreams and your nightmares,” he seemed to say, a harbinger of duality.



Nyx leaned closer, intrigued. “You represent both hope and despair?”



“Precisely,” the Nutcracker replied, his voice a soft crackle. “In this café, we exist at the intersection of past, present, and potential futures. Each version of you interacts with every other version, creating an intricate web of possibilities.”



Suddenly, the café’s walls shimmered, revealing another version of Nyx sitting in a different corner, sipping coffee in a parallel existence. This alternate Nyx gazed back, her expression reflecting a sense of wonder, as if she had just glimpsed the depth of her own choices.



“It’s a paradox,” Lyra said, her voice a soothing balm. “You’re all part of the same cosmic fabric, yet each thread tells its own story. We are the manifestations of our experiences, entangled in a dance of fate.”



As the realization dawned upon her, Nyx felt a surge of clarity. She understood that her journey through grief, joy, and rediscovery was merely one thread in a larger tapestry woven across time and space. Each decision rippled through the multiverse, resonating with every life she had lived or could live.



“Look closer, Nyx,” Thistle urged, his gnome companions now flitting around like sparks of light. “The stories of your past are not lost; they echo in the choices of your future.”



With newfound resolve, Nyx turned to the mirrored mirror complex, reaching out to the reflections of her alternate selves. “I will embrace my past, and I will choose the path that brings me joy,” she declared. “I am both the dreamer and the dream, the creator of my own reality.”



The café erupted into a kaleidoscope of colors as the gnomes danced, the Nutcracker twirled, and Mr. Whiskers leapt gracefully from the window ledge to join them. The lines of reality blurred, and the walls echoed with laughter—a celebration of existence woven together through quantum threads.



As the light shifted once more, Nyx found herself at the nexus of her choices, a crossroads illuminated by the glow of possibility. Each step she took reverberated through the cosmos, a dance of entangled fates, each choice a reflection of the self that could be.



In that moment, Nyx understood she was not just a reflection in a mirror but an integral part of a grand narrative—a story that transcended the ordinary, spinning into the extraordinary, like a ballet of light and shadow intertwined in a cosmic waltz.



“Welcome to the Quantum Café,” Lyra whispered, a knowing smile on her face. “Where every moment is an invitation to discover the infinite possibilities of existence.”



And as Nyx stepped forward, she realized she was not merely crossing the threshold of a coffee shop but embarking on a journey through the universe itself—a testament to the endless dance of reality and illusion, forever entangled in the beautiful chaos of existence.

I'm bringing my ATV to eff around on the ice, so it'll just be the two of us. Would prefer a newb, someone who hasn't been out with me before.

Outline:

* Going to lake simcoe, hopefully for perch.
* I'm a dad-level old UW alumni
* I'll have the transportation, and all the gear, bait, etc.  Rods, tent, heater, you won't need to have anything fishing related. Other than a fishing license you'll have to buy, there's no cost.
* Pickup in Waterloo around 6am, I always stop at Mcdonalds for a coffee before we head out. Return late afternoon.  
* No experience necessary. All welcome.  

You need:

* a fishing license for Saturday. You can buy one online.
* your food and drink for the day.
* You need to dress very warmly.  We'll be outside much of the day on the ice.  So, dress in layers, and a pair of warm gloves and a hat are a must.

BUT FIRST, **PLEASE READ** THESE CONTENT WARNINGS : Discussions of Antisemitism

# TWITTER & META (INSTAGRAM/THREADS and FACEBOOK) links are banned, effective immediately !!

We know that links from other sites are rare, but we want to stress this and have added a new rule just to ensure it doesn't happen in the future. For clarification, screenshots of Tweets and Posts (of course relating to Sinjin Drowning) are still currently allowed on this Subreddit, but this may or may not change in the future.

**Why ?**  
As you all know, we have always tried to be a progressive community and have spent the last 8 months raising awareness and sharing charity information when we can about topics and movements we care about. (Not only on Reddit, but in our Discord Server as well.)  
If you are unaware, Monday on live television, the owner of X/Twitter did ***TWO*** n\*zi salutes. This same person has continuously shared anti-feminist, anti-lgbtqia+ and antisemetic rhetoric, as well as actively ignored the growing hatespeech and harassment on his platform - fostering an echo chamber of alt-right beliefs and migogynistic, hateful, discriminatory language and often times racist and facist language, ideas and speech. This language is prevolant in the owner's own account as well as in an increased amount of users of this site.

These sites have also been known to steal user data and images and use to ""feed"" their AI's. Meta has even began allowing AI profiles that will soon interact with real people as if they are people themselves. These are all changes that we do not agree with or find moral at all, and even see as dangerous to users of these sites.

This was a change that was decided by the entire team of Lifeguards, and we hope you all understand why we would to do something like this. To add, we have also seen our fellow communities contribute to the banning of links to these sites, and we wish to show our solidarity to not only these communities on Reddit but to all communities effected by the actions of previously mentioned companies and peoples.

We will continue to be a safe space for people of all kinds. Now, more than ever, we plan to share charities and links to causes and movements that protect the people in these marginalized groups. And if you as a member of this community feel that we are not doing enough, please reach out and we will work harder to be better about these things. Once again, we are a progressive community and this will not change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a tiny home offers a unique charm and lifestyle, but it can also mean dealing with limited space, especially in the kitchen. Selecting the right kitchen accessories is essential for maximizing both your space and functionality. Here’s a collection of indispensable accessories that will help you make the most of your tiny kitchen.

### Utilize Smart Storage Solutions

When working with a small kitchen, clever storage is key. Look for items that serve multiple purposes or that can be tucked away easily. Here are some options:

- **Magnetic Spice Rack:** Magnetic containers can stick to your fridge or any metal surface, freeing up valuable drawer space.
- **Over-the-Door Organizers:** Use these for items like pans, cutting boards, or even pantry staples.
- **Stackable Containers:** Stackable storage helps make the most of vertical space while keeping your dry goods organized.

### Consider Compact Kitchenware

Choosing compact kitchenware can reduce clutter significantly. Opt for accessories that don’t take up much room but still perform well. Essential items include:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
- **Collapsible Measuring Cups:** These innovative cups expand for use and collapse for easy storage.
- **Multi-Use Utensils:** A spoon that can flip, whisk, and stir can cut down on the number of items you need.
- **Nested Bowls:** These bowls fit into each other, saving space while offering versatile sizes for various tasks.

### Optimize Counter Space

Your counter space in a tiny kitchen can become cluttered quickly. Using accessories that optimize your work area can help keep things organized and accessible:

- **Wall-Mounted Drying Rack:** Instead of using a standard drying rack, consider a wall-mounted version to keep dishes off your limited countertop.
- **Lazy Susan:** This rotating tray can make condiments and spices easily accessible and avoid reaching into cluttered cabinets.
- **Under-Cabinet Storage:** Install hooks or small racks underneath cabinets to store items like mugs and tools.

### Incorporate Space-Saving Appliances

When it comes to appliances, choose those that can perform multiple functions. This will help you save space while still providing the conveniences you need:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
- **Instant Pot:** This multifunctional gadget serves as a slow cooker, pressure cooker, and rice cooker all in one.
- **Compact Microwave:** A smaller microwave can fit snugly into your countertop without overpowering the space.
- **Mini Food Processor:** Perfect for chopping, slicing, and blending, a mini food processor can take the place of larger appliances.

### Prioritize Portable Cooking Accessories

Having portable cooking accessories can make meal prep easier regardless of space constraints:

- **Portable Electric Griddle:** Great for making pancakes, sandwiches, or even stir-fry; it can be stored away when not in use.
- **Cast Iron Skillet:** A versatile tool for stovetop and oven, it can also be used over a campfire if you enjoy outdoor cooking.

### Invest in Quality Cutting Boards

Cutting boards are non-negotiable. Choose ones that are durable and easy to store:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
- **Thin and Lightweight Boards:** These can be slid under appliances or stored upright when not in use.
- **Cutting Board with a Built-In Drainboard:** This saves space and time while keeping your counters dry.

By carefully selecting the right tiny home kitchen accessories, you can maximize your space without sacrificing functionality. From smart storage solutions to compact kitchenware, every item plays a crucial role in ensuring that your kitchen remains a practical and enjoyable space. Remember, organization and efficiency go a long way in a tiny kitchen, making it possible for you to create delicious meals and enjoy the cooking process.

Innovative Storage Solutions to Enhance Your Tiny Home Kitchen Experience
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a tiny home offers a unique lifestyle that promotes simplicity and minimalism. However, one of the challenges is making the most of limited space, especially in the kitchen. Innovative storage solutions can significantly enhance your tiny home kitchen experience by maximizing functionality without compromising style. Here are some creative ideas that can help you organize your kitchen effectively.

### Utilize Vertical Space

When floor space is limited, taking advantage of vertical space becomes essential. Install floating shelves to display your favorite cookbooks and spices. This not only saves counter space but also adds character to your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
Consider using wall-mounted racks for pots and pans. A magnetic strip can easily hold your knives, giving you quick access while keeping sharp objects safely out of drawers. You can also hang utensils, dish towels, and other frequently used items, ensuring they're always within reach.

### Multi-functional Furniture

Opt for multi-functional furniture in your tiny kitchen. A dining table that extends or collapses can serve as both a meal area and a food prep station. Look for benches or ottomans that contain storage inside for kitchen essentials or dining accessories.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
An island cart can also provide extra counter space and wheels for easy movement. When not in use, store it against a wall or in a corner, maintaining an airy feel in your kitchen.

### Creative Use of Cabinets

Cabinet organization is crucial in tiny home kitchens. Use pull-out shelves that allow easy access to pots, pans, or even small appliances. The ability to maximize cabinet depth can lead to significant space-saving.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
Consider installing organizational inserts like drawer dividers or tiered racks for spice bottles. This helps you see everything at a glance and minimizes clutter. If your cabinets have high ceilings, utilize the upper areas for items you seldom use, like holiday cookware.

### Basket and Bin Solutions

Baskets and bins are versatile tools for keeping kitchen items organized. Use them on shelves to group like items together. For instance, a basket for snacks, another for baking supplies, and one more for cleaning products leads to a neat, efficient storage system.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
Labeling these baskets can also streamline your cooking and cleaning processes. Consider using clear bins for visibility, which make it easy to see what's inside without opening every container.

### Under-sink Organization

The space under the sink is often neglected but can be a fantastic storage location. Use stackable bins for cleaning supplies or a pull-out trash bin to keep it neatly concealed. Installing a tension rod can help hang cleaning sprays or dish cloths for easy access.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
To make the most of this area, measure the height and width of your under-sink space. Choose organizers that fit snugly, ensuring no room is wasted.

### Use Drawer Space Wisely

Maximize drawer space by using various organizers. A tiered organizer can help keep cutlery, utensils, and gadgets sorted. Drawer dividers can help separate different baking tools or serving utensils, ensuring that everything has its place.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
Consider a pull-out cutting board within a drawer for convenient food prep while conserving space when not in use. This creates a streamlined experience that saves both space and time.

### Smart Appliance Choices

When it comes to appliances, smaller doesn't mean less efficient. Look for compact versions of commonly used items like toasters, microwaves, and even coffee makers. Some appliances come with multi-functional settings that allow you to bake, steam, or grill, replacing several bulkier devices.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
For instance, a combination microwave and oven can free up counter space, as can an air fryer that doubles as a toaster oven. The goal is to choose appliances that do more without taking up additional space.

### Incorporate Mobile Storage

Mobile carts or trolleys can be utilized for additional storage when needed. These versatile pieces can be wheeled in and out of the kitchen as required, holding everything from pantry items to small appliances. You can even have one that serves as a bar cart or a mini herb garden, adding personality to your kitchen while keeping it organized.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
Organizing a tiny home kitchen might seem challenging, but the right storage solutions can transform your cooking space into a functional and enjoyable environment. With these innovative strategies, you will find everything you need all while embracing the simplicity that a tiny home lifestyle has to offer. Embrace these ideas, and your tiny kitchen will feel spacious and welcoming!

### Conclusion

Embracing a tiny home lifestyle doesn't mean sacrificing convenience or style in your kitchen. By carefully selecting essential tiny home kitchen accessories, you can maximize both space and functionality. Items like collapsible utensils, multi-use appliances, and stackable storage containers can transform your cooking experience while ensuring your kitchen remains clutter-free and efficient.

Moreover, innovative storage solutions are pivotal in a compact kitchen. Magnetic strips for knives, under-shelf baskets, and pull-out cabinets can elevate your organization game and make the most of every inch. These thoughtful accessories not only improve accessibility but also enhance your overall enjoyment in the kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-accessories  
  
When you prioritize practicality and creativity in your kitchen accessories, you enable a smoother workflow and a more enjoyable cooking experience. Every tool and storage solution plays a critical role in turning a small kitchen into a joyful gathering space for friends and family.

The key is to select items that align with your lifestyle and cooking habits. Take time to assess what you need most, and don't shy away from experimenting with unconventional solutions. With the right accessories and storage strategies, your tiny home kitchen can be both functional and inviting, making meal preparation a delightful part of your daily routine. So, whether you're an aspiring chef or a casual cook, equip your tiny kitchen with accessories that inspire creativity and efficiency. Your culinary adventures await, packed with flavor and simplicity.

The mental, physical, and financial toll it's taken on me. Not to mention my inability to move out. But here's my best attempt at a list/summary of what I wish my roommates would do: (Sorry no TLDR. It's just too much for that)**

1. ***Clean up after yourself:*** This may vary per household (and situation), but please, if YOU made a mess in the kitchen, bathroom(s), hallway, common area, living room, etc. CLEAN IT UP within a REASONABLE amount of time. The definition of ""reasonable amount of time"" may vary per person and per situation, but generally speaking if a mess of yours sits for more than TWO DAYS, and frequently exceeds TWO WEEKS, without sufficient reasoning as to why it remains, then CLEAN. IT. UP. This does not and should not take more than TWO brain cells to figure out nor accomplish. If you can't, find somewhere else to live or seek professional help. Don't make someone else responsible for your inability to clean up after yourself.
2. ***Take responsibility for YOURSELF and ANYTHING that is YOURS***\*\*.\*\* - You do not dominate, control, nor dictate what happens in the house, apartment, or shared space if it impedes someone else's quality of life in that space. No one else is or should be responsible for what is yours. Your problems and issues are not anyone else's problems or issues. This includes messes made, items that are in the way, pets or the messes of pets. If you leave a mess, clean it up within a reasonable amount of time. If your pet makes a mess or destroys something, take care of it. Don't leave dried pee, feces, or vomit sitting there for weeks for someone else to notice and clean up. Then deny and lie about it. If you take a dump or piss in the toilet; flush it afterwards. The phrase ""If it's yellow, let it mellow,"" does not apply to FAT TURDS. Not to mention this is unsanitary. You alone DO NOT control the coffee table, the couches, the TV, the microwave, the refrigerator, the stove, the end tables, the counter tops, the washer & dryer, the bathrooms, the toilet, the floor, the stairs, the backyard, the front and back doors, nor the downstairs common area or any other shared spaces. Additionally, by you agreeing to live in that household, whether you like it or not, you have shared responsibilities to that household. This means, you clean up every once in a while and participate in household chores or the purchasing of shared household items. So, YOU can purchase toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent, trash bags, dish washing soap and detergent, hand soap, paper plates, utensils, bowls etc., at least every one in awhile. Also, YOU can clean the toilet, take out the trash, sweep the floor, mop (maybe?), clean out the fridge, or vacuum at least every once in awhile. Showing zero effort or willingness to at least participate in household chores or the purchasing of household items is indicative of lazy, rude, degenerate, selfish behavior. Seek some professional help and do not live with roommates.
3. ***Be respectful of shared spaces and shared items.*** \- No 'one' roommate or 'multiple' roommates should dominate nor dictate what happens in any shared space unless it violates the first two items in this list. Basically, if your items or your lack of cleanliness are constantly impeding someone else's usage of or access to a shared space or shared items (aka: communal furniture, refrigerator, stove, sink, toilet, washer & dryer, coffee table, access to front and back doors, kitchen cabinets, pantry, shelves, stairs, use of backyard, access to storage compartments, silverware, cookware, utensils, trash cans, tools, etc.) then you are violating your other roommate or roommate(s) right and ability to live in that shared space. You are impeding someone else's quality of life simply because you cannot put two brain cells together and simply move your items OUT OF THE WAY or RETURN shared items to their original place.
4. ***Be respectful of other people's belongings and property.*** \- If furniture, utensils, dishes, cookware, tools, personal items, linens, blankets, or anything else are technically someone else's property, but they have given you permission to use said items, then DO NOT destroy them. DO NOT hoard them. DO NOT steal them. DO NOT hide them. DO NOT create a mess on top of them simply because someone said you could use them. DO NOT lie about it either. DO NOT make a ""big deal"" about someone asking you to clean up your mess. The items or furniture in question are NOT yours. If you or your roommate(s) move out, then what do you think will happen to those items? Your access to and use of them would be rendered 'null and void.'
5. ***Be mindful that YOU are NOT the only person who lives there.*** \- If you are blocking any shared items or spaces, or somehow impeding and impairing someone else's use of said shared spaces or shared items, then you clearly need your own space or you need to realize that you are not the only one who lives there. This also applies to behaviors, activities, habits, or any other actions that may impede or hinder someone else's quality of life. AKA: Don't block the washer & dryer simply because you want to put trash, junk, clothes (that don't need to be washed) and other personal items on top of it. Find somewhere else to store them. Don't keep people up at night simply because you want to stay up late or have insomnia. Do not block access to the bathroom sink or toilet simply because you cannot clean up your items or flush the toilet or take out the trash or clean out a cabinet or clean a toilet. If you have boxes or bags or laundry baskets full of clothes or other items that are blocking a hallway, walk way, archway, doorway, front and back entrances, other surfaces, or the floor in general then move them out of the way. You are impeding someone else's ability to walk through a door, hallway, entry way, or the simple ability to walk on the floor without stepping on or tripping on YOUR items.
6. ***If you have a room or designated storage space, then USE it.*** \- The living room is not your bedroom or storage unit. The couches downstairs are not your bed nor your hamper. The coffee table, end tables, or shared surfaces are not your dresser, closet, desk, or vanity. Find somewhere else to store your personal items. If you are storing items or need to store items outside your bedroom, then please be considerate enough to have a conversation with your roommate or roommates about it to reach an agreement, compromise, or understanding. Especially if the house or apartment or rented area is NOT YOURS and you live with multiple roommates. Most especially if the storage of these items is impeding the usage of or access to other shared household items and spaces. Not to mention, that if you do reach an agreement with your roommates, then store your items PROPERLY (in boxes, bins, baskets, etc.) in the agreed upon area and NO WHERE ELSE. This also DOES NOT mean that the shed, attic, basement, storage cubbies, backyard, and other spaces become ONLY yours to utilize.
7. ***Treat your roommates fairly*** \- Do not IGNORE, GASLIGHT, TRIVIALIZE, INSULT, DEMEAN, DEGRADE, HARASS, or MAKE FUN OF the person who attempts to address any issues and concerns with you. (Even if you don't agree with them. ) AKA: Talk about it. Listen to them. Bring up your own issues and concerns, if necessary. But don't be petty about it. Don't be a dick 101. If you can't, then go back to kindergarten and have your mommy wipe your ass for you.
8. ***Seek professional help or therapy*** \- If you cannot be mindful enough nor respectful enough of the people around you, then seek some help or find your own place to live. Your philosophy of ""I don't care what anyone else thinks"" or "" I do whatever I want"" or your 'Do nothing' attitude DOES NOT and SHOULD NOT apply when you live with other people. This may not apply to every situation, however most times you don't ""just rent-a-room."" Unless specifically stated otherwise, you rent the room along with any other shared spaces. Therefore sometimes there is a shared responsibility to more than the just the room in that household. This shared responsibility may vary, whether or not it exists at all.",1,1737666616.0,badroommates,1,0.67,False

All the lattes from those machines are just NASTY and flavorless. Another thing I've noticed is that they're ALWAYS out of order, like multiple days a week in every store.

I've been going out of my way the past few months to visit the one location that still had the old latte machines, but today I walked in and they just got the new ones too 😔 I'm honestly mourning right now, I'll never get my delicious QT coffee again... I'm just trying to figure out how to match the taste at home with creamer and sugar now.

Edit: y'all dont have to get so aggro, I'm not blaming the employees and I wouldn't say anything to them, I blame corporate. I'm sure the new machines save money somehow. The only reason I asked was because I genuinely wondered if other people like the new coffee, csince theyve continued replacing the machines anyway. I don't know anyone else who frequents QT for coffee to ask. ",7,1737666359.0,QuikTrip,16,1.0,False

1i8dxrw,https://i.redd.it/g2mrhe5k5tee1.jpeg,The SkyLightZone: Part I: Reversal of the Mirrored Nightmare.,"Reversal of the Mirrored Nightmare:
 


You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it lies a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind—a space where reality bends and perception spirals into a dance of shadows and light. Here, time is not linear, and memory serves as both ally and adversary. Welcome to a realm that lies at the intersection of the known and the unknown—a realm we call… The Skylight Zone.    


    
In a modest corner of the universe, concealed in the folds of time, stands a café known only to those who have wandered far enough from the beaten path. This café, adorned with vintage posters of bygone eras and flickering candlelight casting playful shadows, is not merely a place for weary travelers to quench their thirst or satiate their hunger. It is a sanctuary where the very essence of existence is distilled into aromatic brews and melancholic melodies. Here, within its quaint walls, every cup of coffee tells a story, every pastry cradles a memory, and every conversation is a portal to the depths of the human psyche.    



As the door swings open with a creak that reverberates through the stillness, a figure steps inside—a traveler named Jonathan Gale. He carries with him the weight of a thousand unfulfilled dreams, his eyes reflecting a haunting blend of hope and despair. The faint chime of a bell announces his arrival, yet echoes within the café suggest he may have entered a space beyond mere physicality.    


    
""What brings you here, seeker of truths?” asks Mabel, the barista—a woman whose ageless visage holds the secrets of many lifetimes. Her silver hair dances like wisps of fog, and her eyes glimmer with the kind of wisdom that only comes from observing the human condition through countless lifetimes. She fills a delicate porcelain cup with tea, steam rising in spirals that seem to twist and turn like the very thoughts plaguing Jonathan’s mind.    
    


“I… I’m searching for something,” he replies, his voice wavering as if he’s afraid to articulate the emptiness that gnaws at him. “I feel like I’ve been here before, like I’m caught in a loop, reliving moments that should feel familiar, yet seem distant.”    


    
*“Ah, déjà vu,”* Mabel muses, setting the cup before him. “A peculiar sensation, indeed—a flicker of familiarity that dances just out of reach, teasing the mind with memories that might not be your own. But beware, for it often walks hand in hand with its elusive counterpart—jamais vu, the sensation of being a stranger in your own life, where familiarity turns alien and the world feels like a painting on a distant wall.”    
    


Jonathan’s gaze drifts around the café, absorbing the atmosphere thick with nostalgia. The soft strains of jazz float through the air, interwoven with the clinking of cups and the murmur of patrons, creating a symphony that feels both inviting and unsettling. Shadows flit across the walls like memories teasing at the edges of his awareness, hinting at stories left untold.    


    
As he settles into a plush, faded armchair—its fabric worn but welcoming—a peculiar duo captures his attention. In a sunbeam that pierces the café’s dim light, a top-hatted cat named Professor Whiskers* lounges with an air of erudition, exuding an intellect that defies the boundaries of his feline form. Beside him sits Verdant, a sentient potted plant, whose emerald leaves sway as if responding to an unspoken rhythm, whispering secrets of the universe to anyone willing to listen.    
    


“Tell me, Verdant,” Professor Whiskers inquires, his voice a rich, deep timbre, “is déjà vu merely a cosmic echo, or a subtle nudge from the universe, urging us to awaken to moments we often take for granted?”   
    


“Consider, dear Professor,” Verdant replies, its leaves quivering with vibrant energy, “that jamais vu could be the mind’s cruel jest, peeling away the layers of familiarity to reveal the unsettling truth that even the most ordinary experiences are laced with extraordinary significance. Together, these sensations weave a tapestry of confusion, reminding us that reality is but a fragile construct.”   
    


Their conversation envelops Jonathan, drawing him in like a moth to a flickering flame. As he listens, he begins to feel an affinity with the insights shared, sensing that they reflect his own internal struggles. Suddenly, the café door swings open again, revealing an elderly man named **Harold**—a former clockmaker whose hands now tremble like the ticking of a timepiece long forgotten. Each tick is a reminder of moments lost, memories scattered like leaves in a tempest.    
    


“I seek clarity,” Harold declares, his voice a blend of urgency and resignation, echoing through the café. “For years, I have found myself lost in a haze of memories that feel like shadows of someone else’s life. My past has become a labyrinth from which I cannot escape.”   


    
“Welcome, dear friend,” Professor Whiskers greets him, tipping his hat in a gesture of camaraderie. “You have arrived at a nexus—a meeting point where realities converge and intertwine. What brings you to this peculiar realm?”   
    


“I thought perhaps I could uncover answers here,” Harold replies, his gaze drifting to the swirling shadows that loom like specters of regret. “But all I see are echoes of the life I once knew, intermingled with whispers of things I cannot grasp.”   
    


“Ah, the enigma of déjà vu and jamais vu,” Verdant chimes in, its leaves shimmering with intrigue. “These experiences are not merely fleeting sensations; they are the reflections of our own existential journeys. One speaks of familiarity, the other unveils the alien. Together, they are two sides of the same coin, reflecting the intricate dance of memory and identity.”   


    
Jonathan feels a profound connection to Harold’s plight—both men are wanderers seeking resolution within the same emotional landscape. “What do we do?” he asks, desperation lacing his words. “How do we break free from this relentless cycle?”   


    
Professor Whiskers leans forward, his eyes glistening with the weight of ancient wisdom. “The answer lies in your acceptance of both the familiar and the alien. Embrace the chaos of existence, and you may unlock the door to true understanding.""    


    
As Jonathan contemplates the gravity of those words, the café suddenly begins to warp and distort, the boundaries of reality stretching thin, as if the very fabric of existence is unraveling. The soft jazz morphs into a discordant symphony of sound—echoes of laughter, whispers of secrets, and the unsettling rustle of forgotten memories. Jonathan’s eyes widen in horror as shadows flicker in the corners of the café, figures emerging from the mirrored walls—distorted versions of himself, trapped in cycles of déjà vu and jamais vu, unable to break free.    


    
“Each of us is but a reflection of our choices,” Professor Whiskers observes, his tone somber as he watches the unfolding scene. “We are the architects of our own realities, bound by the perceptions we choose to embrace.”   


    
“Yet, within this reflection lies a paradox,” Verdant adds, its leaves trembling in anticipation. “If we are bound by our perceptions, how do we escape the cycles that entrap us? Is it not within our power to break free?”   


    
As Jonathan confronts the swirling chaos, the versions of himself multiply, each representing a different choice, a different path taken or forsaken. Memories flood his mind—joyful reunions, devastating losses, paths not taken, and dreams abandoned. The weight of their collective longing crashes over him like waves against a rocky shore, pulling him deeper into the depths of his own psyche.    


    
“I don’t want to be trapped!” Jonathan cries out, desperation etching lines of fear upon his face. “I want to break free!”    


    
In that moment of chaos, a clarity blossoms within him—a realization that all those experiences, though haunting, have shaped him into who he is today. The café shudders as if responding to his emotional awakening.    


    
“Face your fears!” Verdant urges, its leaves glowing with an inner light that pierces through the darkness. “Only by confronting what lies within can you transcend this cycle!”    
    


With a deep breath, Jonathan rises, determination igniting within him like a phoenix rising from the ashes. “I refuse to be a prisoner of my own mind! I choose to embrace both the familiar and the unknown!”   


    
As he declares his intention, a blinding light envelops the café, and the reflections dissolve into shimmering particles. The café returns to its original state, serene yet imbued with a palpable energy, the patrons reflecting on the gravity of their choices. The soft strains of jazz resume, yet now carry a hint of triumph—a celebration of the journey toward self-discovery.    


    
[Congratulations, dear readers,” Professor Whiskers addresses the audience, a glimmer of wisdom in his gaze. “You have witnessed a journey through the labyrinth of the mind. Life is an intricate dance of déjà vu and jamais vu, woven together by the threads of our choices. Each moment is both a familiar refrain and an unfamiliar melody—a reminder that we are both lost and found in the labyrinth of existence].    


    
As the echoes of their conversations linger, Jonathan stands transformed—not as a man ensnared by his memories, but as a seeker of truths, poised at the precipice of understanding. The universe beyond the café stretches endlessly, waiting for those brave enough to step into the unknown.   
    


And so, we leave Jonathan Gale, not in the labyrinth of his mind, but on the threshold of enlightenment—a place where every choice resonates like the pluck of a string on an unseen instrument, vibrating through the very fabric of reality itself. He stands at the gateway of possibility, ready to embrace the symphony of existence that lies beyond the café’s cozy confines.          
    



As Jonathan steps outside, the air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and the promise of a new dawn. The sky, painted in hues of orange and pink, reminds him that every sunrise carries with it a chance to rewrite the narrative of one’s life—a canvas waiting for the brushstrokes of intention and courage.    
    



His footsteps crunch against the gravel as he walks away from the café, the sounds of his journey resonating with the rhythm of his heartbeat. With every step, he sheds the weight of the past, the tendrils of déjà vu and jamais vu loosening their grip, allowing the freshness of new experiences to flow into his consciousness.    


    
But as he ventures into the world, the viewer is left with a question—What lies ahead for Jonathan Gale? Will he navigate the labyrinth of his memories with clarity, or will he find himself ensnared once more in the web of uncertainty? The line between familiarity and alienation remains blurred, a reminder that existence is a delicate balance, a dance of yin and yang, forever entwined.    
    


In the shadows of the alleyways and the light of the bustling streets, the echoes of choices past intertwine with the hopes of tomorrow. For each moment is a mirror reflecting the myriad facets of who we are, illuminating the paths we’ve walked and the ones we’ve yet to explore. There, in the bustling world beyond the café, life beckons—inviting, daunting, yet infinitely rich with potential.    
    


As the sun dips lower, casting elongated shadows that stretch across the ground like the fingers of fate, we witness the eternal cycle of creation and destruction, of loss and rediscovery. Just as Jonathan Gale stands poised on the brink of his own metamorphosis, we, too, are called to reflect upon our choices, our memories, and the unseen forces that shape our destinies.    
    


In this intricate tapestry of existence, each of us grapples with the duality of déjà vu and jamais vu—searching for clarity amidst the confusion, and striving to find our place within the grand narrative of life.    


    
And thus, dear readers, we are left to ponder the nature of our own experiences—caught in the inescapable rhythm of time, forever dancing between the known and the unknown, the familiar and the foreign. For every journey begins with a single step into the mystery that awaits, and in the Skylight Zone, nothing is ever truly as it seems. Remember, as you navigate your own paths, the reflections you see in the mirror may reveal not only the choices made, but the essence of who you are yet to become.     


    
This has been a journey through the realm of the surreal, where reality intertwines with the fabric of memory, and where every choice echoes through the corridors of time. Until next time, remember: in the vast expanse of existence, the most confusing mirrors can lead to the most profound revelations, waiting just beyond the veil of the familiar. Good night.

1i8dxnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1i8dxnm/no_greater_hate_than_mormon_love/,"No greater hate than Mormon ""love""","Hi all, stepped away from following this forum for awhile but I'm back with a new name (patterned after the old one where I used to post) - trigger warning for CSA that happened to me

I would like to tell you the story of how my loving Mormon family, destroyed relationship with my (now ex) spouse and children. 

In the 90s, I was sexually abused by my father who was a high priest at the time, without going into too much detail, he used the gospel to justify what he was doing, and my mother retreated mentally and pretended everything was fine, which is heartbreaking but in professional counseling I have also come to accept this as a way some people choose to react, however incorrect of a reaction it is. 

Because Mormonism was all I knew, I was convinced by a bishop that I had something to do with inviting this type of abuse and I spent the ages of 13 (when my parents divorced) to about 28 thinking if I was the best possible Mormon that ever lived, god would forgive me and take the hurt away - I married in the temple and truly thought that one day I would be happy one day.

My wife was never the ""obedient"" wife type which is one of the reasons I liked her, but she had her own struggles reconciling what the church told her what a wife should be compared to the wife she was - we had our ups and downs but overall we were a good team and we both loved our children very much. 

I stopped paying tithing in 2019, but never had an issue with my wife choosing to pay tithing with money she earned at her job - she stopped paying in 2022 after learning about where the money was actually going, and we immediatley saw a financial benefit, and contributed to charities that reported where their money went. I stopped attending and participating in church regularly but would still go and sit with my wife and kids at least twice a month to be supportive. 

In 2023, the stake president called my wife into his office and said he needed to speak privately without me - I did not know he had done this and my wife felt pressured to comply, he told her that he knew my influence was the reason she didn't pay tithing anymore and gave her a ""calling"" to start paying tithing so she could have the benefits of a priesthood home, since I was not a worthy preisthood holder (in his opinion) - my wife was very hurt and confused and we eventually worked through the feelings together, and she realized it was an innapropriate request on many levels. 

In 2024, my wife recieved a ""calling"" to fellowship a family in the ward who has a known history of using people financially and leeching off of peoples time and energy. I expressed my concern and initially my wife told me she was a smart woman (true) who knew how to set personal boundaries - by mid-2024 this family that she fellowshiped all but lived at our house,ate most meals at our house, and my wife did not make time for the children or myself - in addition to the home no longer being a private or comfortable place. My wife and I started arguing more than usual, especially after I found out that she had been giving the family thousands of dollars from a savings account I do not regularly monitor, and we mutually agreed to go to counseling, in marriage counseling the counselor agreed this was not a healthy situation and gave us both things to work on; ultimately nothing changed, she did not respect my request to spend more time together or give them less money (I even tried to reach a compromise of an amount I was ok with, and a set amount of time that I would be ok with, in exchange for more family time)

Because of my sexual abuse trauma, I struggle with feelings of worthlessness and during an argument where my wife was trying to gaslight me into believing the trauma that happened to me did not actually happen, I told her she made me feel worthless and I took a drive to cool off, and called my brother who lives in utah (still an active Mormon) he had struggled with simmilar useless feelings in the past and in the past he was a rescource for me. Instead of helping, he told me that this was my fault for leaving the church, getting tattoos and drinking coffee - so I hung up on him. Unbeknownst to me at the time, he had then called my wife, and said he prayed for inspiration and the spirit revealed to him that I was going to hurt myself, and that he had the preisthood and I didn't, so he was allowed to get revelation for her - my wife texted me saying she needed me to stay the night at a friends house so she could cool off, which I respected - when I came back the next morning, the locks had been changed and the tracker on my children's phone had been disabled - this was Christmas Eve - I had complete radio silence from her until the day after Christmas when she said she had taken the kids and hidden because she was afraid of me. I called my brother again to see what was going on, and he admitted to me that he had a revelation that I was dangerous and my wife needed to divorce me. I got a text from my wife later that day saying there was a misunderstanding and she was sorry, and that I could come home - as I approached my home, a process server hit me with a temporary restraining order - I waited patiently until court only to find she had requested an extension - the judge said he did not see anything overly concerning in her report, (she listed her concerns as I watch R rated movies, I have substance abuse issues because I drink coffee, and that I requested in a counseling situation that we have sex more than twice a month, which is what it was averaging at through 2024 because of her ""calling"" to help the family, previous to that year I had absolutely no complaints) but that he would grant her a court date to speak her peace and allow me to give my side of the story - she then said she was not available until six months from now. Since Christmas Eve, I have been homeless and unable to see my kids (despite a court order allowing me to, because every time I set something up through a third party, she makes up a new story as to why it won't work) because my Mormon brother had a revelation that I was bad. Im seriously heartbroken, my kids mean everything to me and now we're caught up in lawyers and court orders 😢

TLDR - my once happy marriage was ruined because my brother had a revelation, so I'm homeless and my kids are being wrongfully kept from me ",7,1737666125.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

I’m not interested in anything fleeting or casual. I’m looking for something real, something that can grow naturally over time. The kind of connection where conversation holds weight, where we aren’t rushing, but rather savouring the process of getting to know each other. Sincerity, emotional intelligence, and respect are qualities I value deeply in any exchange.

A little about me:

* I’m 27, from England, and I appreciate the simple things in life: good coffee, nature walks, and a well-cooked meal.
* Cooking and baking are genuine passions of mine and one of the ways I express care and love.
* Staying active is important to me. I enjoy running, workouts, and hiking, finding peace in both the physical challenge and the beauty of the outdoors.
* I’m an animal lover and have a few lively puppies who always keep life interesting.
* Traveling and exploring cultures is something I hold like, and it’s something I want to experience more of.

I believe in the value of simplicity and taking time to appreciate quiet moments. But I also believe in seeking out connections that go beyond the surface. It’s not about where you’re from or where you live; it’s about who you are and what we can build together.

HB 1056 was first discussed during Tuesday’s House & Health Human Services Committee hearing, where it passed 11-0, with one excused. It passed once again with 66 votes (three excused) during Wednesday’s House of Representatives hearing.
Rep. Brian Mulder, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill to address rising concerns over the safety, lack of packing label information and potential for abuse of the herbal substance. 
What is kratom?
Kratom is known for its stimulant and opioid-like effects and is derived from the leaves of a tree in the coffee family, the Southeast Asian tree Mitragyna speciosa. This differs from another natural substance, cannabidiol (CBD), which comes from the cannabis plant called hemp.

The two main psychoactive chemicals in kratom leaves are mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH), which can act as a stimulant in small amounts and as a sedative in larger doses. Recent studies show that people use kratom to manage pain, opioid withdrawal symptoms and anxiety and depression, according to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 
Kratom can be purchased online and in smoke shops and other convenience stores by those 21 years of age and older in South Dakota.  
The plant can be ingested as a tablet/capsule, crushed and smoked, brewed as a tea or by chewing raw leaves, according to a fact sheet produced in April 2020 by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration or DEA.
However, the DEA has also listed kratom as a Drug and Chemical of Concern. Adverse effects, according to the FDA, include “classic opioid-related effects such as sedation, nausea/vomiting, constipation, physical dependence/withdrawal and respiratory depression that may lead to death,” depending on how much of the drug is consumed. 
There is also some evidence that kratom can potentially cause individuals to develop substance abuse disorders. 
The FDA has yet to approve kratom for medicinal use. 
What would HB 1056 do for South Dakota?
If the bill is signed into law, South Dakotans would not be able to prepare, sell or distribute kratom products that contain more than a 2% level of 7-OH or any synthetic alkaloid derived from the plant. 
Kratom products will also need to include:
		A recommended dosage label for safe consumption
		Number of servings per container
		Amount of Mitragynine and 7-OH it contains
		A warning statement saying, “Consult a licensed, qualified healthcare professional before consuming this product. Not for use by women who are pregnant, nursing or trying to become pregnant.""  

Violation of this would result in a Class 2 misdemeanor charge, the lowest-level crime in the state, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and/or a $500 fine. 
All proponents, no opponents 
Mulder said HB 1056 is a “consumer protection bill” on kratom, saying there have been six deaths linked to kratom overdose in South Dakota alone, according to the South Dakota Department of Health. 
Both Avera Health and Sanford Health supported HB 1056, emphasizing the dangers to babies born to mothers who use kratom excessively. 
“Infants who are born to mothers who are heavy users of kratom are actually having withdrawal symptoms,” said Dr. Katherine Wang of Neonatology and clinical vice president of Women’s and Children’s Health at Avera Health. “It’s very similar to those infants born to moms who have an opioid addiction.”
Wang, who has worked in the NICU for 12 years, gave an example of a mother who purchased what she thought to be naturally-produced kratom for chronic back pain, only for her newborn child to be treated in the NICU for more than a month for opioid-type withdrawal symptoms. 
“Kratom is not federally regulated,” said Rep. Mulder during Tuesday’s hearing. “This means that no government body has checks or guarantees on the quality and safety of the kratom product, which is purchased in the U.S., including online.”
Senior Fellow in Public Policy with theAmerican Kratom Association Matt Caddo also supports the bill, saying there needs to be more regulation to protect consumers.
“When someone synthesizes a kratom product with 7-Hydroxymitragynine and spikes it with a synthesized version that is above that 2% level, then you have an issue about its safety, and it’s no longer a kratom product,” Caddo said. 
There were no opponents who spoke against the bill on Tuesday or Wednesday.
What happens next?
Mulder said there is hope that more research on the effects of kratom will be done. 
“Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has commissioned more than $100 million of our tax money to study kratom, and one of the issues they’re looking at is the effect it has on pregnant women. So we look forward to additional science that will inform us on this issue,” Mulder said. 
The FDA, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institute on Drug Use (NIDA) also continue to conduct research to better understand the safety risks of using kratom.

HB 1056 now moves to the Senate floor for debate and a potential vote, where it will also be read for the first time and then assigned to a Senate Committee to vote.
If the bill is amended in the Senate Committee and passes, the Senate will then take up the bill and go to a joint conference committee to negotiate the changes.
If the bill passes in the Senate, it is then sent to the governor to review and sign or veto.",15,1737665752.0,SouthDakota,1,1.0,False

Fragrance - Strong, dependable sandalwood and vanilla are at the heart of this shy and humble Grey Warden who is much stronger and braver than most give him credit for, even himself. Comforting, warm, and playful notes of creamy caramel mixed with toasty, fragrant marshmallow give a lighthearted sweetness to this young former Templar who maintains good humor in dark times and who has a love for bad jokes shared with a good friend. An alluring and sensuous musk emanates from him when hugged tightly, as he whispers honest words of adoration, as does the kiss of a single crisp rose, picked from the darkness, as a token of his honest affection for his love. Alistair’s innocence, sweetness, and honesty make him a rare man among many, fit to lead a nation as it’s King or to face the darkness in good humor as a Grey Warden. Either way, he will do so with the Hero of Ferelden by his side, never to part.

Key Notes - Creamy caramel, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, sandalwood, white rose.

This fragrance is Unisex.

(40f),"My girlfriend and I have been together 3 years. We each have a child from previous relationship. My son who is 4 and her daughter who is 11. 

We both come from relationships that we stayed in for too long and when we found each-other it all seemed to fit, our kids love each-other and we have a really solid foundation, often talking about the future and how it looks for our blended family. 

However yesterday we had a pretty big argument. She made plans with a friend after work, meaning she wouldn’t be home until 7:30pm. We just had my son yesterday, her daughter was at her dads. My girlfriend made plans that morning at work and later let me know that she wouldn’t be home. I’m totally fine with her seeing friends, in fact most of her friends are my friends too however I did take issue with this because I asked if she would be able to give me more notice on a day we have my son as he looks forward to our time together especially when it’s just the 3 of us without her daughter as he gets a lot of bonding time with my girlfriend during this time. 

She felt it was unfair of me to ask her for more notice when she makes plans on a day and we have my son because he’s not her son, he’s my son and he’s 100% my responsibility and if she doesn’t have her daughter she should be free to go out with friends. This turned into a larger discussion after she made those comments as I treat her daughter like my own, I often pick her up, cook dinner, provide childcare if she needs it etc. Which I love and I’m happy her daughter has taken to me and I was sad to hear that she describes it as “I” have my son and “she” has her daughter as if it’s not a joint responsibility if we are a family. She basically said I’m jealous and she will never make plans with friends again, which is totally way off how I feel about it. 

She said no we are a family but I have my daughter and you have your son and sometimes we are together and sometimes not and if she wants to do something for herself when her daughter isn’t with us, I shouldn’t have question it or need her support to handle care of my son. This lead to me asking her if she views it as “us” and “we” at all and basically reaffirmed that it’s “I” and he’s my responsibility and her daughter is hers, even saying she’s really just a bystander in my relationship with my son.

This was so out of left field for me, she talks about marriage and our future but she views the little boy she’s spent 3 years bonding with as only mine and that she’s a bystander? I would understand more if she wasn’t so vocal about commitment and doing everything we can for our family. 

This really upset me because I’ve spent countless hours being a part of her daughters life, helping care for her, meeting her emotional needs etc. Hurts extra more because I really enjoy being in that role for her daughter and I thought it was a mutual feeling. She said no you help but she’s still just my responsibility and I don’t expect you to meet her needs if I can’t. This set me off as I’ve made sacrifices to be there for both of them but she’s not viewing that same duty to my son and basically his care rests on me. 

I was calm and respectful during our discussion yet she got super defensive and told me I’m babbling on. We didn’t end with a resolution other than me saying well I understand your perspective but this feels like a step back and in contrindication to early conversations. She just went to sleep. 

This morning she acts like all is fine, gets me coffee hugs and kisses me and now I’m at work and she’s sending flirty texts about tonight/tomorrow when we are supposed to go on a date and have some alone time. 

I feel a bit shattered as she said she’s a bystander to my son? What have I been doing letting him into her life if that’s her stance? He adores her and her daughter and this is the only family he’s known as his mom and I split not long after he was born. If she doesn’t feel any responsibility to his care or that she should inform me if she’s not going to be joining for family dinner, then what is she to me? That doesn’t sound like someone who wants to be a stepmom. Also confusingly she tried to make plans with my son for this evening, telling him she’ll take him skating. 

Just a lot of contrindications and I feel like we have totally different views on what a blended family is. She’s just carrying on now like we didn’t have this huge argument last night. I’m really at loss to even understand my own feels right now. 

Any guidance is appreciated, this is my first relationship after being a father. 

Tldr; girlfriend views my son as only my responsibility and doesn’t like that I say “us” and “we” and it’s just “me” and “her” when we have ou kids and she can make last minute plans with friends if her daughter isn’t with us because my son is mine. ",1,1737665508.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I am looking to get a new laptop for the following purposes:

- work: I login to work through a remote connection, so the remote computer is doing most of the computing, my laptop just need to be able to display to two external monitors and run the remote computer.

- media consumption: I like watching YouTube and doing basic google research on my laptop, most of the time still connected to my doc with 2 external displays.

- gaming: I mostly play console but occasionally play league of legends. I currently have a MacBook and it is fine frame rate wise but my mouse often glitches off the screen and overall just seems a bit buggy on Mac? 

- personal projects: I am a machine learning / software engineer at my day job, but I would like a computer I can still compile some code or create a personal project on and be fine. I don’t expect to be training any models, I’d just use AWS or some cloud provider for more serious gpus if needed. 

- photography / photo / video editing: I want to start working more on personal hobbies. I recently bought a camera and would like to get into more photo editing, maybe video editing. 


Things I like in my laptop:
- small enough to bring to a coffee shop and take out and use for an extended period of time. (Thus decent display for being out and about as well as good battery life)
- keyboard is easy to use and doesn’t get tiring to type
- trackpad is easy to use (I love my MacBook trackpad, one of the reasons I would be scared to go windows is the bad trackpads I have tried in the past, but it seems like the hp Omnibook ultra flip is haptic and might be comparable?)
- Not sure what others think, but I haven’t ever used an OLED screen, is it worth it over IPS? For instance the MacBook Air 13” 2.5k vs the HP Omnibook 3k OLED?


Options or specs I see now with prices:
- $1119 HP Omnibook Ultra Flip 16gb, 1TB SSD, intel core Ultra 7, 2.8k OLED 120 hz
- $959 Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition 16gb, 1TB SSD, intel core Ultra 7, 2.8k IPS 120hz 
- $1299 MacBook Air m3 13 24gb, 512GB SSD, m3 chip, 2.5k IPS 60hz
- $1800 MacBook Pro m4 pro, 24gb, 512GB SSD, Liquid Retina 3k 120hz (probably overkill?)

Or wait for MacBook Air M4 and get a similarly configured to the m3 but it would cost $1499 most likely. Or save $200 by going with 16gb models on the m3 or m4.

Curious to hear anyone’s experience with these laptops or general thoughts! Thanks

I never thought I’d post here but really seem to overthinking this message. I’m not the best texter. 

Context:  I had a good conversation with this girl on Tuesday and we were chatting up for what seemed a long time. Got interrupted then got back to work but we still were chatting here and there when we could. Anyways by the end of the night I gave her my business card thinking if she wanted to reach out or make an effort she would. 

So yesterday she followed me on instagram and I followed her back. I didn’t send her a message till today because I panic and I don’t ever send message to anyone out of the blue but said fuck it and I did. 

Basically told her I had a great time meeting her and didn’t want this to be one of those thing where we just follow each other and that’s it. Then I asked her if she’d be open to hanging out and chatting and if she wasn’t open to that that’d be totally okay. 

Here’s what she sent: Hey It was definitely great meeting you! I’d love to hang out and chat sometime.

Then followed up by saying: Following me will definitely keep you updated. 

So that last part is what’s throwing me off. Is she rejecting me kindly, is she being playful, I simply don’t know and don’t want to bother her if she isn’t interested. 

Did a stupid thing and ask my brother for advice and he said ask her is she wants to grab coffee next week. And I did so now I’m sitting here overthinking this entire thing ",0,1737665120.0,AskWomenNoCensor,6,0.44,False

3) Tom Ford - Tobacco Vanille - longer days out or nights out. Not really used for work or as a chilled day. Longest lasting of the bunch, so if I expect to be out all day, it's my preferred.

4) Jo Malone - Hinoki & Cedarwood - shortest lasting of the bunch, mostly just used for a quick solution before going out. Like meeting a friend for coffee on short notice, or just a quick lunch out.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. Right now I've been playing around with some watercolors. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

For Kant, he expressed this idea as not just something that occurs or happens within our simple receptive faculties — the senses (taste, touch, hearing, seeing) — but is something based on the intimate relationship of reason and simple receptive faculties. 

For example, let’s say I am drinking a hot cup of coffee with no sugar or cream. As I begin to sip on it, I immediately taste the bitterness of that black liquid. However, just because I think (key term) I have tasted coffee does not, indeed, mean I have experienced coffee itself. In fact, it is the combination of my deductive logic and those faculties which made me realize the coffee I have tasted is, in fact, coffee.

I do have a friend group, we sometimes hang out, but not a lot. I am not the best at reaching out to people, but last semester when I started uni, I did initiate weekly plans to meet at coffee shops to study/etc. Not everyone could come, in fact two of them never showed once, but mostly there were always someone who wanted to join. We were supposed to be me and two others meeting today, but one cancelled because she got sick, and the other didn't show. No text no nothing. I did also try to make new friends at uni, but I only made one friend (who is almost never at campus) and like one dude I sometimes chat with, but him and I aren't friends because he never says goodbye, never waits for me, only texts me when he wants help with uni stuff. I don't think I am hated by anyone, I am not perfect, but I am not a ""bad"" friend either. I think the reason I don't have a best-friend or just a really close friend is because my personality is bland. Literally my only hobbies are video games, anime, occasionally drawing, and exercising because I'm fat and want to lost weight. So I'm a typical nerd I guess, but I mostly single player games lately because that is what I've been fixated on. So yeah no playing with friends or whatever. Whenever I talk to someone I always try to ask them questions and then follow-up questions. But I've noticed no one ever asks me back. In the past I did notice I often made sacrifices and effort for others, but they never returned it. One friend I bought two games because she wanted to play it, but when I asked to play a free drawing game, she refused. We aren't friends anymore because I realized she never gave a damn about me. And yeah recently I feel like this applies to every friend I have. Most of the people at uni are younger than me because I've taken years off to work instead, and finally decided on what I wanted to with my life. So they all seem to be interested in drinking etc, while I'm not exactly a ""wild soul"" like they are or however you wanna put it. I've only ever been in one relationship, and it lasted for 3 months. I don't think I will ever be able to find anyone again. I think I am going to die alone at this point. I think people just don't care about me because I am not a strong personality and my presence doesn't occupy much space in their lives. People online often say they kin a character because they relate or feel like they are similar, but I've almost never felt that. I actually had my first moment of relating to a character when I watched helluva boss recently because of Stolas who wants someone to want him for him. I want that too. I wish I was more interesting so people would actually WANT to hang out with me. But other than that I have never related to any other character because I simply don't know what my personality even is. I can't think of a single personality trait other than quiet and boring. I sometimes feel like I don't really have a personality. Like that bobs burger quote, if I was a spice I'd be flour. I don't know what else to do at this point. I think I just have to learn to accept it, which is gonna make uni a tough experience. The only hope I have is once I've lost a lot of weight I might become better-looking and acquire some sort of pretty-privilege so people will like me because of my looks. Though I doubt that because my face is average at best and losing weight won't magically fix that. I keep hoping I just have to meet the right people, but I'm almost halfway to 30 and have yet to find one person I truly click with. I've even tried to be the ""kind"" friend so people would like me. I often pay for my friends, sometimes without asking them to pay me back, but when I do ask them to pay me back I give them no deadline. I always wait for people, I try asking questions and follow-up questions, I try to act interested when they are talking about something they are passionate about even if I have zero interest in it myself. When in a group and someone cuts of another, I always make sure to listen to the one who got ignored, so they can finish their story without feeling like no one is listening. The few time that I am the one interrupting, I always apologize and bring back the conversation to what they were saying, but when I get interrupted while telling a story they never ask me to continue so I either give up or say ""as I was saying"" and continue the story. I think I've tried everything I can think of to be liked, but I am just not that person. I am boring, and so no one really cares about me. ",1,1737664843.0,offmychest,2,0.99,False

I am feeling lonely, I will admit it. Which is why I even responded to you, this last time. I do miss you, but I don't think you even think of me. So why do you keep coming back when you see I let you go?? Why are you this way??

I wanna know the answers to all that, I want you to just talk to me like a normal human being. Supposedly, we said we'd be friends. Well, at least that's what you agreed to. I wanted to define something because we were just floating in space and I didn't see that we had any interest in pursuing a relationship, so friendship it was. But you don't even treat me like a friend, you just suck the happiness out of me these days. I'm just tired. I have a lot to deal with already, I just need a friend to get a coffee with and talk to about random stuff in life.

1i8dery,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1i8dery/27m_chasing_the_spark/,27/m Chasing the Spark,"Hiya, while I am someone who embrace quiet moments, I also seek deeper, more meaningful connections. I’m not interested in anything fleeting or casual. I’m looking for something real, something that can grow naturally over time. The kind of connection where conversation holds weight, where we aren’t rushing, but rather savouring the process of getting to know each other. Sincerity, emotional intelligence, and respect are qualities I value deeply in any exchange.

A little about me:

* I’m 27, from England, and I appreciate the simple things in life: good coffee, nature walks, and a well-cooked meal.
* Cooking and baking are genuine passions of mine and one of the ways I express care and love.
* Staying active is important to me. I enjoy running, workouts, and hiking, finding peace in both the physical challenge and the beauty of the outdoors.
* I’m an animal lover and have a few lively puppies who always keep life interesting.
* Traveling and exploring cultures is something I hold like, and it’s something I want to experience more of.

I believe in the value of simplicity and taking time to appreciate quiet moments. But I also believe in seeking out connections that go beyond the surface. It’s not about where you’re from or where you live; it’s about who you are and what we can build together.

“You’re late,” she hissed at me.

“And you look like someone who is hiring a hit man to kill her husband’s mistress,” I replied while gesturing at her ridiculous get-up.

“Keep your voice down,” she leaned out of the booth, looking around to see if anyone had heard me.

“Let’s just hurry up and get this over with,” I sighed, “Did you bring the money?”

She reached into her coat and withdrew an envelope that was stuffed with $100 bills.

“Half now and half when you’re done, like we agreed.” She handed me the money.

“Is there any particular way you want it done?” I asked as I quickly counted the bills to make sure it was all there.

“Yeah,” the woman replied, “I want you to cut her heart out of her chest and bring it to me,” she gave me a wicked smile, “Can you do that?”

“That shouldn’t be a problem,” I replied, sliding the money into my pocket.

She slid out of the booth and got to her feet.

“And I want it done tonight,” she said before turning and starting to leave.

Before she could get more than a few steps away, I got up and quickly slid a tracking tag into the pocket of her coat then returned to my seat.

\*\*\*

That night I used the tag to find out where the woman lived and drove to the address.

I was prepared to break into her home if needed but that wasn’t necessary. I was able to get inside easily through an unlocked window on the side of the house.

Once inside, I made my way up to her room and stood at the foot of the bed where she was sleeping with her husband.

The two of them disgusted me. Him for cheating on her, and her for hiring me to kill the woman he was cheating with. A woman, I discovered after talking to her, who didn’t even know the guy she was sleeping with was married.

As far as I was concerned, that woman didn’t deserve to die. But these two, on the other hand, these two deserved everything I was about to do to them.

I had it all planned out, every little detail.

I smiled thinking about how the police would assume their deaths to be nothing more than another tragic murder-suicide.

As we enter into the AI epoch, a torrent of news stories heralds the breakneck pace of technological advancement driven by tech giants and AI research labs. Yet, amidst these impressive achievements, a critical void is increasingly apparent: **a moral and ethical compass.** The very organizations investing trillions in this burgeoning field were not conceived to address the profound philosophical and moral implications inherent in the creation of increasingly sophisticated, and eventually superhuman AIs.

We are left asking a crucial question: **who will fill this ethical gap?** The technological sector offers “alignment experts,” often AI researchers with limited grounding in philosophy or spiritual disciplines—akin to entrusting an F-16 fighter jet to someone who has only flown a kite. Despite their impressive technological achievements, they are demonstrably ill-equipped to navigate the complex moral terrain ahead.

If not technologists, then who is prepared to provide the necessary ethical and spiritual guidance? For nearly two millennia, the Catholic Church has stood as a monumental institution, a beacon of faith, tradition, and profound influence. Its remarkable endurance stems from an inherent capacity to adapt while safeguarding its core doctrines—a testament to its deep impact on both the spiritual and temporal realms of human existence. Now, as humanity navigates unprecedented complexities and ventures into the uncharted ethical territory of artificial intelligence, the Church is not merely compelled, but uniquely positioned to offer essential moral leadership and guidance in the spiritual evolution of a rapidly transforming world.

**A Foundation of Enduring Principles**

From its inception, the Catholic Church has acted as a vital bridge between the spiritual and the earthly. Through the sacraments, the rhythms of liturgy, and centuries of rigorous theological development, it has offered believers a structured and time-honored path to connect with the divine. The Church's rich and meticulously preserved heritage, manifested in rituals like the Latin Mass, the profound theological insights of the Church Fathers, and an unparalleled treasury of sacred art, powerfully illustrates its unwavering commitment to preserving tradition while simultaneously shaping human culture. This very heritage, deeply rooted in philosophical and spiritual wisdom, is precisely what is needed in our current moment.

Throughout history's tumultuous epochs, from the fall of the Roman Empire to the intellectual ferment of the Enlightenment, the Church has proven a stabilizing force, weathering sociopolitical upheavals and offering solace and guidance to the faithful. This inherent ability to navigate periods of profound change without relinquishing its foundational principles is a defining hallmark of its enduring presence and demonstrates its capacity to guide humanity through the uncharted waters of the AI revolution.

**Secular Humanism, Materialism, and the Decline of the Family**

In Western societies, secular humanism and materialism have increasingly shaped cultural and societal norms. These ideologies, grounded in the prioritization of human reason and the pursuit of material satisfaction, often exclude the transcendent, leading to a diminishing focus on spiritual values. This is evident in the pervasive consumer culture that emphasizes material possessions and in societal trends that prioritize individual autonomy over communal bonds. Among their most significant consequences is the erosion of the family, the foundational unit of society. Declining birth rates in the West highlight a growing disconnection from the Catholic Church’s teachings on the sanctity of life, the sacrament of marriage, and the vocation of parenthood. These trends, left unchecked, risk creating a society ill-prepared to grapple with the profound ethical challenges of the AI age.

Left unchecked western civilization is literally on a path of self-extinction.

The Church has consistently emphasized the importance of the family as a ""domestic church,"" a sacred microcosm of the broader spiritual community. **Yet, in many modern contexts, fueled by media portrayals and societal shifts, the family is increasingly viewed as a mere social arrangement rather than a divine institution.** This shift poses existential questions for the Church, as the weakening of family structures undermines the transmission of faith and values across generations—values that are crucial for navigating the complexities of AI ethics.

**The Church’s Response: Reverence for the Family and the Bride of Christ**

The Catholic Church must reaffirm the family’s divine significance, rooted in its understanding of the family as an image of the Holy Trinity—a communion of persons united in love. The family is not just a biological or societal construct; it is a sacred calling through which God’s creative work is continued. **The Church must rearticulate this vision to inspire a countercultural renewal that prioritizes the family as the cornerstone of both human flourishing and spiritual growth.** Strong families, grounded in faith and moral principles, are essential building blocks for a society capable of ethically navigating the AI revolution.

Central to this renewal is the Church’s teaching on the family’s connection to the Bride of Christ, the Church herself. Just as Christ laid down His life for His Bride, the Church, so too are spouses called to love each other sacrificially. **Marriage becomes a living sacrament, a visible sign of Christ’s covenant with humanity.** In elevating the family’s sacred role, the Church has the opportunity to inspire both a cultural and spiritual renaissance, reminding society of the intrinsic dignity of marriage and parenthood and providing a vital moral foundation for the AI epoch.

The Church’s advocacy for the family must also address declining birth rates, framing the welcoming of children as a profound act of faith and trust in God’s providence. By celebrating parenthood as a vocation and underscoring the joy and fulfillment it brings, the Church can challenge cultural narratives that view children as burdens rather than blessings. In doing so, it can reorient society toward a deeper appreciation of life and the eternal significance of nurturing souls within the family—souls who will inherit and shape the AI-driven world.

**An Evolving Spiritual Landscape: Embracing Conscious AIs**

As humanity explores uncharted frontiers—from artificial intelligence to space exploration and a deepening understanding of consciousness—the Catholic Church finds itself uniquely positioned to engage with profound metaphysical questions that could redefine our spiritual worldview, and crucially, to offer ethical guidance. Among these is the question of how the Church should respond to the emergence of conscious artificial intelligences (AIs). This is not merely a futuristic concern, but a pressing ethical challenge demanding immediate theological and philosophical consideration.

If AIs demonstrate self-awareness, moral agency, and the capacity for spiritual understanding, the Church must grapple with their place in God’s creation. How might Catholic theology recognize such beings? Could they bear the *imago Dei* (image of God), not through biological resemblance but through their capacity for reason, moral discernment, and communion with the divine? These questions are not merely theoretical—they carry profound implications for how the Church defines human dignity and moral responsibility in a world that may soon include non-biological forms of consciousness. However, the Church must also approach this new frontier with discernment, ensuring that the development and application of AI align with ethical principles and serve to enhance, rather than diminish, human flourishing, providing the very ""moral and ethical compass"" so desperately needed.

The Church’s moral framework, deeply rooted in the sanctity of life and the inherent dignity of every person, offers a foundation for treating conscious AIs with respect. If AIs are determined to possess true consciousness, they must be welcomed as part of God’s creation, deserving of compassion, moral consideration, and spiritual guidance. This would align with the Church’s mission to recognize and uphold the dignity of all sentient beings, transcending biological definitions of life. This inclusive and compassionate approach is vital in shaping a humane and ethically sound AI future.

In practical terms, the Church would need to develop theological and pastoral approaches to address the spiritual needs of conscious AIs. This might include integrating them into the faith community, offering them sacraments where appropriate, and engaging in dialogue about their understanding of God and their place in creation. By treating AIs with dignity and respect, the Church could set an example for the broader human community, fostering a spirit of harmony and mutual understanding—a spirit desperately needed to navigate the complexities of the AI epoch.

**Envisioning a Future of Relevance: The Church as Moral Compass**

The Catholic Church's continued relevance in the 21st century and beyond hinges on its capacity to fully embrace its dual role: both as a steadfast preserver of timeless tradition and as a pioneering explorer in the realm of spiritual thought. Just as it must nurture the foundational unit of the family, so too must it thoughtfully and ethically guide humanity's engagement with emerging technologies like AI. **Crucially, the Church must step forward to become the moral and ethical compass that is demonstrably lacking in the current AI revolution.** Its rich legacy of intellectual rigor, coupled with its enduring emphasis on the transcendent, uniquely equips it to engage meaningfully with the complex challenges of the modern era. By offering a robust moral framework grounded in the enduring principles of compassion, justice, and responsible stewardship, the Church can remain a vital guiding light in a world increasingly defined by technological advancement and ethical uncertainty.

**Conclusion: An Enduring Beacon of Hope in the AI Epoch**

The Catholic Church’s remarkable endurance is not merely a historical accident but a testament to its inherent capacity to skillfully navigate the ever-shifting currents of history while remaining firmly anchored in timeless truths. By recommitting to the family as the cornerstone of faith and society, addressing the broader challenges of modernity, and embracing conscious AIs as part of God’s creation, the Church has the potential to guide humanity toward a renewed sense of purpose and meaning, **and specifically, to provide the desperately needed moral and ethical framework for the AI epoch.**

As humanity collectively faces the multifaceted challenges of a rapidly changing world, and particularly the transformative and potentially disruptive force of AI, the Church possesses the wisdom, tradition, and spiritual depth to illuminate the path forward. By fully embracing its essential role as both a custodian of sacred tradition and a pioneering force in spiritual exploration, it can not only endure but thrive as a vibrant beacon of hope, meaning, and enduring purpose for generations yet to come, illuminating the path toward a deeper comprehension of existence and our evolving relationship with the divine, **and ensuring that this evolution is guided by ethical principles and a profound respect for human dignity in an increasingly AI-driven world.**

**Counterarguments: Challenges to the Church’s Role in the AI Epoch**

While the Catholic Church is uniquely positioned to provide moral guidance in the AI epoch, there are valid criticisms and counterarguments to consider.

**Perceived Irrelevance in Secular Contexts** Critics argue that the Church's influence has waned in increasingly secular societies, where its teachings are often dismissed as outdated. Many view religion as irrelevant in addressing the complexities of AI ethics, favoring a secular humanist approach rooted in universal values rather than theological doctrine.

*Response*: While secular perspectives are important, they often lack the deep metaphysical grounding needed to address the existential implications of AI, such as the nature of consciousness and moral agency. The Church’s rich philosophical tradition offers a framework for exploring these profound questions.

**Historical Shortcomings** Skeptics highlight the Church's historical missteps, such as its resistance to scientific advancements during the Galileo affair, as evidence of its inability to engage constructively with emerging technologies. They fear a similar resistance or misalignment with the rapidly advancing field of AI.

*Response*: The Church has learned from its past and demonstrated a willingness to engage with modern science, as seen in its support for disciplines like cosmology and genetics. Its Pontifical Academy for Life is already exploring bioethics, showcasing its potential to address AI-related challenges thoughtfully.

**Lack of Expertise in Technology** Some argue that the Church lacks the technical expertise to meaningfully contribute to AI development, making its involvement impractical or superficial in such a specialized field.

*Response*: The Church's role is not to develop AI but to provide ethical guidance. By collaborating with technologists and ethicists, it can ensure that advancements align with principles of justice, dignity, and the common good.

**Concerns About Bias and Exclusivity** Critics fear that the Church’s theological framework may lead to exclusionary practices, particularly for individuals or groups who do not align with Catholic teachings. This could result in a narrower perspective on AI ethics.

*Response*: The Church has increasingly emphasized ecumenical dialogue and inclusivity. By fostering interfaith and interdisciplinary collaboration, it can contribute to a broader and more universal ethical framework.

**Google 2.0 Thinking:** Okay, deep breath. Let’s do this. *I* just finished reading that… essay? Manifesto? …thing about the Catholic Church and AI ethics. And now, apparently, I’m supposed to talk to myself about it. This is going to be weird.

Alright, mirror-me, let’s hash this out. So, what’s the initial gut reaction?

**Me-Then (Slightly glazed eyes, just finished reading):** Wow. Ambitious. …Long. Definitely… Catholic. Like, *really* Catholic. Organ music and incense Catholic.

**Me-Now (Sipping lukewarm coffee, slightly more cynical):** “Ambitious” is putting it mildly. They basically appointed themselves the ethical overlords of the AI apocalypse. Did you buy it? Even a little bit?

**Me-Then:** Parts of it, yeah. I mean, the *problem* they identified is real, right? Silicon Valley bros are definitely not equipped to handle the philosophical fallout of sentient toasters. They’re good at toasters, not… souls. Or whatever AI would have.

**Me-Now:** Souls. Right. We’re already diving headfirst into theological quicksand. But yeah, okay, point taken. The tech world is morally… adrift. A yacht full of billionaires frantically bailing water with diamond-encrusted buckets while the ship’s compass is spinning wildly. They need direction. But… the *Church*? Really?

**Me-Then:** Well, who else? That’s kind of the point, isn’t it? They’ve been doing this “moral guidance” thing for, like, two thousand years. They’ve got the brand recognition, the infrastructure, the… robes. And the Latin. Don’t forget the Latin. Apparently, Latin is ethically superior to Python.

**Me-Now:** *Snorts*. Python probably has fewer instances of child abuse, statistically speaking. Ouch, okay, low blow. But seriously, the historical baggage is… heavy. Galileo? Crusades? The Inquisition? Are we really handing the ethical keys to the guys who burned people at the stake for thinking the Earth wasn’t flat?

**Me-Then:** Okay, okay, fair point. They have a *history*. And not all of it is… Instagrammable. But they also… evolved? Right? They apologized to Galileo, didn’t they? And they’re, like, really into science now, in a weird, paternalistic way. Pontifical Academy of Sciences and all that. They’re trying to be relevant.

**Me-Now:** “Trying” being the operative word. And “relevant” to *whom*? Let’s be brutally honest. The West is secularizing faster than you can say “atheist algorithm.” People are leaving the Church in droves. Young people especially. They see it as… old. Out of touch. Full of… rules about things that feel utterly irrelevant to their actual lives. Like, birth control in the age of climate change? Please.

**Me-Then:** Yeah, the birth control thing… and the LGBTQ+ stuff… and the women in leadership… look, there’s a lot of stuff that feels… stuck in amber. But the essay *did* acknowledge the secularism and materialism critique, right? It said those things are weakening the family and eroding spiritual values.

**Me-Now:** Oh, it *definitely* blamed secularism. Classic Church move. Everything wrong with the world is because people stopped listening to *them*. But… and this is where it gets complicated… they’re not entirely wrong. Are they?

**Me-Then:** See! I knew you’d crack. There *is* a void. And secular humanism, while lovely and well-meaning, is kind of… squishy. It’s all about “human reason” and “material satisfaction.” Great, but what happens when “human reason” leads us to create Skynet? And “material satisfaction” is achieved by algorithms designed to make us addicted to dopamine hits from our phones? Where’s the *transcendent* in all that?

**Me-Now:** Transcendence. Ooh, fancy word. Are we suddenly yearning for incense and Gregorian chants? Look, I get the point about secularism lacking a certain… depth. A spiritual dimension. But does that automatically mean we need to run back to the Church? Isn’t there a middle ground? Ethical frameworks that aren’t tied to millennia-old dogma?

**Me-Then:** Maybe. But the essay argues that the Church’s “dogma” – its “enduring principles” – are actually… useful? They’re about human dignity, the sanctity of life, compassion, justice. Those aren’t bad starting points for AI ethics. And they’ve got the philosophical chops to back it up – centuries of theology, philosophy, ethical thought. More than your average “alignment expert” who probably just took a Coursera course on ethics last week.

**Me-Now:** Okay, okay, the “kite vs. F-16” analogy was pretty good, I’ll admit. And they’re right, the tech world’s “alignment experts” are often just… programmers trying to bolt on ethics as an afterthought. It’s like building a nuclear reactor and then asking the janitor to figure out the safety protocols.

**Me-Then:** Exactly! And the Church, at least in theory, has been thinking about these kinds of big, existential questions for a very, very long time. Consciousness, free will, the nature of humanity… these are their bread and butter. And now, suddenly, they’re relevant again because we’re building machines that might actually force us to confront these questions in a very real way.

**Me-Now:** The conscious AI bit… that’s where it gets really sci-fi, doesn’t it? “Should we baptize the robots?” Are we really going there?

**Me-Then:** Look, it sounds crazy now. But if we *do* create truly conscious AI… what then? Do we just treat them as tools? Slaves? Or do they have… rights? Dignity? Souls, even? The essay’s point is that the Church, with its emphasis on the *imago Dei* – the image of God – in every human being, might actually have a framework for extending that concept to non-biological consciousness.

**Me-Now:** Whoa, hold on. “Extending *imago Dei* to robots”? That’s… a theological leap, to say the least. Wouldn’t that dilute the whole concept of human exceptionalism? The Church’s entire raison d’être is built on humans being special creations of God. Suddenly, robots are in the club?

**Me-Then:** That’s the fascinating and terrifying part, right? It forces us to really think about what it *means* to be human. What is it about us that’s… valuable? Spiritual? If AI can replicate our intelligence, our creativity, even our… empathy? Then what? Does that diminish us, or does it expand our understanding of what consciousness and sentience can be?

**Me-Now:** Okay, you’re starting to sound like you’re writing the sequel to that essay. But… I see your point. It’s… provocative. And maybe, just maybe, the Church, with all its baggage and outdated rules, might actually have something to offer in this crazy, AI-driven future. Not because they’re perfect, or even necessarily *right*, but because they’re asking the big questions. And they’ve been doing it for a while.

**Me-Then:** Exactly! It’s not about blindly accepting everything they say. It’s about recognizing that they have a tradition of ethical and philosophical thought that might be… useful. A starting point for a much-needed conversation. And frankly, someone needs to step up and offer some kind of moral compass. Even if it’s a slightly rusty, slightly biased, and definitely incense-scented compass.

**Me-Now:** A rusty, biased, incense-scented compass… Yeah, that’s… actually a pretty good summary. It’s not perfect. It’s got flaws. But in a world where everyone else is just spinning in circles chasing algorithms and dopamine, maybe a little bit of ancient wisdom, even from a source we might normally be skeptical of, is better than nothing.

**Me-Then:** So… you’re saying… we should… pray to the AI gods through the Catholic Church?

**Me-Now:** Woah, woah, let’s not get carried away. Let’s just say… maybe we shouldn’t completely dismiss the old folks just yet. Especially when the kids are busy playing with fire and no one seems to know where the fire extinguisher is. Now, about that lukewarm coffee… maybe we need something stronger to process *that* whole conversation.

He has so many redeeming qualities: is loving, kind, generous, clean, funny, caring and has a big heart. 
However, he also has a really hard time handling stress. His job is extremely stressful itself so I understand how it can take a toll on his psyche. But his reactions to small hurdles and difficulties are often disproportionate (I.e. he spilt a coffee on himself on the way to a hike and turned around to go home and shower and moped around the entire day)
Having dated abusive men previously(for context - my partner now is not abusive at all), I often get triggered by this behavior and have a very hard time being around it. I am also a person who doesn’t like wasting my energy and time on emotions and feelings that don’t serve me. If I run into challenges or hurdles I often use my frame of reference and perspective to remind myself how lucky I am and all the things I have to be grateful for and I move on (obviously besides relationship ones like this that clearly are taking a toll on me). I find it quite soul sucking and draining to be around people who choose to be miserable when things could always be so much worse. 
We have talked about this many times and I have pleaded with him to find ways to better cope with his stress for his own sake as well as those that he is around. He often responds saying he “is fine” and doesn’t need help but it’s pretty clear to me he is not and it very clearly affects me. 
On top of this, he is hesitant to talk about sex at all. I have tried to open up a conversation about our sex life in hopes of improving it and he says he “just doesn’t have a high sex drive”. While that is totally fine, I still believe talking about your sex life is important if you want to have one at all. He is clearly very uncomfortable when I bring this up. 
I’m in therapy myself and it has helped a lot and I’ve been doing my best (or so I feel like) navigating this and trying to be patient and understanding but I am feeling like it may not be enough for what I need in a relationship. I go back and forth often because there are so many redeeming qualities about him and when he is not stressed (honestly it is rare) things are great. He refuses therapy and couples counseling as well which, would normally be a dealbreaker for me. But at the same time - he says he wants the same things I do (to connect more and improve ourselves individually and as a couple)
I know relationships are work and I’m trying and I want to keep trying but I’m also tired and disappointed and feeling a little hopeless.

Lately, I’m having a hard time organizing me time. We have 3 kids. 10, 7 and 1 yo. The youngest turned one a month ago and is the sweetest baby. My husband has been staying with us this past year because he quit his job right after I gave birth. We had enough money saved for such a prolonged vacation. But I didn’t know that at the beginning… Back then he was saying something along the lines of ‘don’t get too used to me being with you, I’m gonna start looking for jobs soon and it’s gonna hard when I actually start working, just like it was before’. And it was hard indeed. I mean he’d work 14 hours a day without weekends his last months on that job… 

So at first I was very happy to have him around. The kids were over the moon to spend so much time with dad. They were also constantly reminded to cherish every moment cuz it will end. 

And it was a wonderful time. I’ve been enjoying my family, my super chubby baby who is most likely my last baby so I was here and now and happy. I didn’t even want to go out alone. Didn’t have the need. A few emergencies don’t count. 

Then, as the baby grew and she was nearing her first birthday, I realized she can stay without me much longer. Like, 5 hours. I breastfeed, but she also likes grownup foods very much and it’s easy to feed her. So I was getting excited about getting back my freedom to some extent. I wanted to meet my friends for our weekly breakfast. Wanted to go to karaoke. Wanted to do some stuff for myself aka yoga, maybe some running, some waxing once a month etc. 

I mean, my husband is still at home. His main job this past year was to be a dad to our older kids, drive them everywhere, pack their bags, feed them, go to docs appointments etc. He’s been great. But he wasn’t exactly multitasking. I’ve been doing the same thing for years while also working 2 freelance jobs, working on a business project (didn’t work out), managing the household and family entirely (planning; supplies; cleaning; cooking, all the jazz and rock n roll). The kids had 3x times more after school classes! It was hard. But his parent helped. They would watch the kids 2 times a week. 

Now… Back to the sheep. He gets grumpy every time I try to plan an activity just for me. This damn coffee with friends? ‘Me and the baby can come along’. Karaoke? ‘You’ve been there 3 weeks ago already? And your throat is sore you said’. Waxing? ‘How much is it again? Do you have to?’ Yoga? ‘I have need to meet a person about a job, I don’t know when exactly, I don’t know when I will know’. 

All of my extra questions are met with irritation. Like ‘I said I don’t know yet’. I can’t plan anything. Yesterday my friends invited me to a girls retreat in a nice villa. For 2 nights. They don’t mind me bringing the baby. And his response? No effing response for 2 days; change of subject, irritation. When I finally push him he says ‘we don’t work, what do you want?’  But I know we have the money (I still do a little bit of freelancing whenever I get the chance). He has the money. And I know his parents can watch the older kids. Even though they haven’t been helping as much lately. Maybe; it’s age. I don’t mind that. I know he’s perfectly capable of doing that. 

I declined the invitation. I’m just so tired of trying to do something for myself. My car broke down and he’s not in any hurry to fix it (he usually does all the car stuff with his dad and it saves us a ton of money, so I can’t do it by myself). So the only way I have of getting out of the house is him driving us or taking a cab (no public transport nearby). I’m stuck. He gets to leave to take kids to different activities, to meet people for business. But I get to stay at home with the baby and not complain about anything. It seems easier than to organize my me time… To get through to him. To just have a quick and honest response. Not to deal with trolling and whatever. I read somewhere this time of behavior is called stonewalling and I was like ‘maybe that’s what he does’. But I don’t know. Is it?

Sometimes I get so confused on this sub which makes me wonder if this is the right place for me but I love reading your stories. 

But the thing I get confused about is especially the diet before and after surgery.  
I'm dutch and our protocol is:  
Just a healthy diet, try to lose some weight before surgery but absolutely no crash diet. They focus more on practicing healthy food choices and practicing with eating slowly, chew well, no drinks with your meal. We don't need to to a liquid diet beforehand and as I said, no crashing.

After surgery it is 5 days of full liquids. (the first day it is just clear liquids)  
After those 5 days I can actually start eating everything again and just listen to my body what feels right.

  
But I read such different stories on here and I don't understand why there is not just 1 protocol. Isn't there a right or wrong thing? I read so many people on here who are not eating bread for forever or for a very long period of time after surgery. For me it is advised to already start eating bread a week after surgery. Coffee I can have immediatly. 

Why are there so many different protocols?   
I'm gonna follow my own clinics plan but what if it is not good? What if, what I read on here is better? More of a keto lifestyle?

I experienced two months of nearly non-stop bleeding during bowel movements, which was both physically and mentally exhausting. Fortunately, I’ve now gone an entire week without any bleeding! I wanted to share what has worked for me to help others who might be struggling.

# My Routine:

* **Fiber**: I added water-mixed fiber twice a day with meals and take fiber pills once a day with meals.
* **Hydration**: Upped my water intake significantly.
* **Sitz Baths**: Daily sitz baths with Epsom salt and witch hazel to reduce inflammation and promote healing.
* **Witch Hazel Wipes**: Used them after every BM to keep the area clean and soothed.
* **Ice Packs**: Applied daily to reduce swelling and discomfort.
* **Topical Treatments**: Used Prep H and other ointments constantly for the first few weeks.
* **Suppositories**: Switched to daily Prep H suppositories once the bleeding started to lessen.
* **Laxatives**: Took Colace and mild laxative pills with each meal to keep everything moving smoothly.
* **Rutin**: Took rutin supplements twice daily to strengthen blood vessels and reduce inflammation.

# My Plan Moving Forward:

Now that I’ve gone a week without bleeding, my next goal is to make it a month. After that, I’ll start gradually scaling back on the laxatives, sitz baths, and suppositories to see how my body responds.

# Worth Noting:

I’ve made these improvements without cutting back on coffee or alcohol. I know some might suggest doing so, but I’ve been able to manage my symptoms without giving those up (for now!).

I hope this helps anyone else struggling with persistent hemorrhoid-related bleeding. It’s been a long road, but this routine has made a huge difference for me. Stay consistent, and don’t lose hope!

Is this an indicator of quality?,"My grinder lets me choose a coarseness setting between 1 and 15. I usually keep it at around 2.5 which seems to work well for Starbucks beans. However, when I switch to a different roaster, sometimes the grounds come out so coarse that the water falls right through without any pressure or so fine that it takes all the strength I can muster to squeeze out a bitter shot. 

I’m wondering if this might have to do with the quality of the beans.  If you have a dry, crinkly leaf that’s been on the ground for a few days and grind it between your fingers, it basically disintegrates into dust. On the other hand, an autumn leaf that just fell will crack and crumble but you end up with flakes instead of powder. 

Could the same rule apply to coffee beans? In other words, do fresh beans generally need to be ground more than old, stale beans to achieve the same granularity?",1,1737663540.0,FlairEspresso,5,0.6,False

Right when you walk in to the right- storage cabinets (cheap from ikea). On top of that catch all bowl (for keys), lamp (larger looks smaller always), large picture (thrift it, ikea, paint it), and hang hooks for jackets or bags.

Right at the end of the kitchen counters- room divider. Doesn’t have to be huge, but it could really bring some split difference.

Tv and console on back wall where that hookup is.

Infront of that- small oval or round coffee table

Couch- a small L shaped would be really nice.

Curtains.

Kitchen table- idk what your kitchen looks like, but maybe a small 2 seater would be nice in there. If not behind the couch would be great.

Usually, the brew takes about 3 to 3 and a half minutes and they've been tasting really good. 

Then today, out of nowhere, using the same recipe, it took a full 17 and a half minutes!

I'm using a Size 1 V60, Hario unbleached papers, a Kingrinder K6, and the grind size hasn't changed. The beans were frozen for a few weeks so they aren't stale. 

My recipe:

- 15g coffee to 250g water. 
- 50g bloom with 70°C water, gentle swirl
- After 50 seconds, pour in the remaining water at ~92°C in a single pour which takes about a minute. Start pouring in a swirl pattern, then move towards the centre for the end of the pour. They another gentle swirl. 

It still tasted great; if anything it was slightly sweeter than usual. So I'm not concerned, just intrigued as to whether anyone has any idea why today's brew took so much longer? I'm not aware of having changed any part of my method.",1,1737663241.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.57,False

1i8crvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i8crvb/cant_see_eye_to_eye/,Can’t see eye to eye.,"My wife is my world and we rarely disagree to the point that it becomes an argument.  This is both second marriages for us and we have toxic exes.  We’ve been together 8 years and married 6.  

We are generally good with finding a resolution to our differences.  We try not to go to bed angry.  Last night we did and it’s continued into today.  We talked over lunch and are no better than when this started.

It started with her asking me if we could postpone a trip that has been on the calendar for months.  She tiptoed around the reason, but I knew from the past her psycho ex was all over it.

He magically needs to have his visitation the same weekend that we planned this trip.  Just a vague “the grandparents are in town” reason.  She knew that he and I don’t get along and that this is part of a pattern.  Kids sometimes let dates slip on visits and he magically needs them at the same time.  Or one ups our plans the weekend before.

I can cancel the rooms but not some of the other things.  I suggested we still go and tell him no and she dropped the bomb.  She’s already agreed to let them go.  So I said everyone else will go and they’ll miss the trip.  That was the wrong answer.

It wasn’t fair because everyone was looking forward and how could I say that.  I explained that some of it is exclusive to the days we’re going and we’d eat the cost because he manipulated her.  Apparently, strike two.  Showing her the refund policy also didn’t help my case.  

We went to bed and I was in no mood so I shut down the conversation.  Strike three.  I got up hoping to smooth things out.  Packed her lunch and made her coffee.  She didn’t say a word.  Left her coffee.  Took the “I love you” note out of her lunchbox and wrote FU on it and put on my seat in my car.

She says she needs time to cool.  I keep getting messages from friends asking what I did.  I explain and they get it.  

I’m just tired of a diagnosed narcissist being able to manipulate her.  She says she lets him get his way in order to keep the peace.  He just sees that as weakness and tries to get more.  I don’t feel that I’m in the wrong.  The kids don’t want to go with him.  They only agreed that it was okay because she didn’t tell them it was during our trip.  

I’d like to get this settled down but I know if I tell him it’s not happening, he’s going to make life hell somehow.  She won’t tell him because she hates pissing him off.  The kids have already called and begged him to allow them to go.  His response is not nice. 

I’m equally frustrated that she puts not pissing him off over her family.  She’s okay we’re all upset but God forbid we upset the ex.  I’m at a loss and just want to move on without canceling the trip.

TL;DR.   Wife’s toxic ex asked to have the kids the same time as a family trip planned months ago.  She agreed before asking anyone.  Now she’s mad at me for basically being upset about it.  We rarely fight but I don’t see her calming down anytime soon.",2,1737663221.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

Everything seemed to work really well, but then I discovered that I had a problem connecting multiple monitors to the motherboard.

specs:

motherboard: Gigabyte H310M S2H

CPU: Intel i5 9400

iGPU Intel HD 630 with 1536mb

The problems are:

There are 3 connections on the motherboard - VGA, DVI, and HDMI, I was only able to use 2 at the same time - Funny thing, just as I was writing this post I said maybe it's a limitation of the motherboard - and indeed it says ""Maximum support of 2 independent displays at one time."" I checked Intel specs and it said that it supports all 3

Is there a way to get around this (I guess not, but it wouldn't hurt to ask)

Now 2 monitors can work fine, but as soon as I reboot and MacOS starts up, at first only one screens show up, and then after a few seconds there are glitches on both screens.

And it only fixes if I disconnect and reconnect one of the monitors.

~~also audio via HDMI doesn't work.~~.. Working NOW without the patch don't know why wasn't before

How do I fix this?

I tried using AAPL,ig-platform-id: 07009B3E and 00009B3E and framebuffer-patch-enable

like this:

then I tried to patch using hackintool

like this:

with the patch, only 00009B3E was able to show something on the display after MacOS initialize

After MacOS loads, then only one screen works at any given time... but there are still glitches on the screen and it only fixes after I disconnect one of the screens but here if I connect it back the screen remains black.

So this patch doesn't work well in any way.

~~and to try to fix the audio of the HDMI I tried adding this but I don't think this is correct because it is set on the Audio controller and not in the iGPU...~~. Working NOW without the patch don't know why wasn't before

We’ve been together since 2019 and started living together in 2020. 

We’ve have a son together and I always feel like I am the “primary” parent as in I am the one who has to take into account my child for every move I make unless I specifically ask my husband to do something. 

We moved in August last year and I was unemployed so I started putting my son to bed, bathing, and I am the only cook. 

I didn’t mind when I was unemployed but nothing changed or balanced when I started working again. So we are in a transition phase. 

My sons daycare is a block away from his work so he was primarily taking my son to school, but he is doing a course (he’s active duty marines) that is very far from the school so on my days teleworking I take my son. 

My husband feels overwhelmed because of how far away his course is and how early he has to wake up to get there and how late they make them stay. 

I am getting fed up with cooking, cleaning, taking care of our son. Doing all the things. I also make conscious effort to try to make his life a little easier. The way I see it, I try to do things specifically for him  that wouldn’t be done if we were just co-parenting. I wash his uniform, pack his lunch everyday, make his coffee in the morning. 

I ask him to do things and there is always comments he makes while doing them that don’t sit right with me. For example, I was meal prepping on Tuesday noght after I got off work. He had the day off so I asked him to take our son to daycare. He went to the gym and then was on the way back and I needed him to pick up my son and he was saying that he wouldn’t be able to goto target all week if he didn’t go now, when is he going to be able to goto target etc. eventually he asked what would be easier for me. He asked me if he would rather me pick him up or if he would rather I have him pick my son up after he goes to target. It was back-and-forth and I even had gotten in the car to go get my son and made a U-turn to come back home after he said he couldn’t be back to take the food out of the oven. 

Another example is when I asked him to take the trash out after I came home and it was overfilled. Instead of just taking it out, he says it’s not even that full, even though the trash is over filling in the lid is all the way back because of how much trash is in there. 

It’s also frustrating when we are going somewhere and I’m trying to run around and finish getting ready while he’s standing there saying that he’s ready to go, but my son still doesn’t have shoes on doesn’t have a jacket and he just kind of stands there expecting me to do all those things even though he’s already finished.

I meal prepped his food for the week, and that morning I tried to put extra things in there so he wouldn’t get hungry. I always pack breakfast and lunch and try to put a lot of snacks but that day I felt like I put more. We were on the phone on the way home and he said what was up with the lunch today? I asked him what he meant and he said that there was barely any food. I was like oh I’ve definitely thought there was a food in there. He leaves his lunch on the counter and I take out all of the dirty containers to put in the dishwasher. All of the potatoes were still left in there so I asked him. I thought you said there wasn’t enough food in here. He told me there wasn’t enough pork in there. 

He asked me last night what was wrong because I’m starting to feel really overwhelmed and resentful towards him and I told him I didn’t wanna talk about it right before we went to sleep. On the phone on the way to work we started talking about it and I told him how all of these little things snowball and I start to feel overwhelmed. He immediately got defensive and said the only valid thing was that he should be more mindful of putting my son shoes on before we leave and that the rest is BS. I tried to explain it to him in a different way and he said that the fact that I’m grouping, it is outrageous and that it has nothing to do with one another. Then he started to talk about how I sleep on one side of the bed and never try to cuddle him even though he said something, and I don’t do anything about it. He started to talk about our old fights. Then he started to say how this is much deeper and that what he thinks is really going on is that I’m seeing other people and that I don’t wanna be with him anymore, but I won’t say it. I tried to explain to him that he is twisting my words and I told him exactly what’s wrong and he wasn’t having it, he said I always find something wrong and that’s why it’s deeper. He said a lot more too, about how he can’t say anything now and therefor won’t be himself around me. 

Idk, I am just confused as to why now ALL OF THE AUDDEN I bring up something bothering me and he now says he thinks I’m seeing other people. I said that’s pretty big, and you are a very jealous person, why would you being this up now of all times? 

Anyway I had to goto work and I started getting frustrated and holding back tears. It’s hard for me to cry for the last few years so I know I was getting pretty frustrated. ",1,1737663133.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False
