""Today is a day in the Grand Battle, the immortal Mother of All Battles. It is a glorious and a splendid day on the part of the self-respecting people of Iraq and their history, and it is the beginning of the great shame for those who ignited its fire on the other part. It is the first day on which the vast military phase of that battle started. Or rather, it is the first day of that battle, since Allah decreed that the Mother of All Battles continue till this day."" –Saddam Hussein, in a televised address to the Iraqi people, January 17, 2002

The tyrant must steal sleep. He must vary the locations and times. He never sleeps in his palaces. He moves from secret bed to secret bed. Sleep and a fixed routine are among the few luxuries denied him. It is too dangerous to be predictable, and whenever he shuts his eyes, the nation drifts. His iron grips slackens. Plots congeal in the shadows. For those hours he must trust someone, and nothing is more dangerous to the tyrant than trust

Saddam Hussein, the Anointed One, Glorious Leader, Direct Descendant of the Prophet, President of Iraq, Chairman of its Revolutionary Command Council, field marshal of its armies, doctor of its laws, and Great Uncle to all its peoples, rises at about three in the morning. He sleeps only four or five hours a night. When he rises, he swims. All his palaces and homes have pools. Water is a symbol of wealth and power in a desert country like Iraq, and Saddam splashes it everywhere—fountains and pools, indoor streams and waterfalls. It is a theme in all his buildings. His pools are tended scrupulously and tested hourly, more to keep the temperature and the chlorine and pH levels comfortable than to detect some poison that might attack him through his pores, eyes, mouth, nose, ears, penis, or anus— although that worry is always there too.

He has a bad back, a slipped disk, and swimming helps. It also keeps him trim and fit. This satisfies his vanity, which is epic, but fitness is critical for other reasons. He is now sixty-five, an old man, but because his power is grounded in fear, not affection, he cannot be seen to age. The tyrant cannot afford to become stooped, frail, and gray. Weakness invites challenge, coup d’état. One can imagine Saddam urging himself through a fixed number of laps each morning, pushing to exceed the number he swam the previous year, as if time could be undone by effort and will. Death is an enemy he cannot defeat—only, perhaps, delay. So he works. He also dissembles. He dyes his gray hair black and avoids using his reading glasses in public. When he is to give a speech, his aides print it out in huge letters, just a few lines per page. Because his back problem forces him to walk with a slight limp, he avoids being seen or filmed walking more than a few steps.

He is long-limbed, with big, strong hands. In Iraq the size of a man still matters, and Saddam is impressive. At six feet two he towers over his shorter, plumper aides. He lacks natural grace but has acquired a certain elegance of manner, the way a country boy learns to match the right tie with the right suit. His weight fluctuates between about 210 and 220 pounds, but in his custom-tailored suits the girth isn’t always easy to see. His paunch shows when he takes off his suit coat. Those who watch him carefully know he has a tendency to lose weight in times of crisis and to gain it rapidly when things are going well.

He has a tattoo on his right hand, three dark-blue dots in a line near the wrist. These are given to village children when they are only five or six years old, a sign of their ritual, tribal roots. Girls are often marked on their chins, forehead, or cheeks (as was Saddam’s mother). For those who, like Saddam, move to the cities and come up in life, the tattoos are a sign of humble origin, and some later have them removed, or fade them with bleach until they almost disappear. Saddam’s have faded, but apparently just from age; although he claims descent from Muhammad, he has never disguised his humble birth.

Saddam likes to watch TV, monitoring the Iraqi stations he controls and also CNN, Sky, al Jazeera, and the BBC. He enjoys movies, particularly those involving intrigue, assassination, and conspiracy—The Day of the Jackal, The Conversation, Enemy of the State. Because he has not traveled extensively, such movies inform his ideas about the world and feed his inclination to believe broad conspiracy theories. To him the world is a puzzle that only fools accept at face value. He also appreciates movies with more literary themes. Two of his favorites are The Godfather series and The Old Man and the Sea

Saddam has been advised by his doctors to walk at least two hours a day. He rarely manages that much time, but he breaks up his days with strolls. He used to take these walks in public, swooping down with his entourage on neighborhoods in Baghdad, his bodyguards clearing sidewalks and streets as the tyrant passed. Anyone who approached him unsolicited was beaten nearly to death. But now it is too dangerous to walk in public—and the limp must not be seen. So Saddam makes no more unscripted public appearances. He limps freely behind the high walls and patrolled fences of his vast estates. Often he walks with a gun, hunting deer and rabbit in his private preserves. He is an excellent shot.

Saddam is a loner by nature, and power increases isolation. A young man without power or money is completely free. He has nothing, but he also has everything. He can travel, he can drift. He can make new acquaintances every day, and try to soak up the infinite variety of life. He can seduce and be seduced, start an enterprise and abandon it, join an army or flee a nation, fight to preserve an existing system or plot a revolution. He can reinvent himself daily, according to the discoveries he makes about the world and himself. But if he prospers through the choices he makes, if he acquires a wife, children, wealth, land, and power, his options gradually diminish. Responsibility and commitment limit his moves. One might think that the most powerful man has the most choices, but in reality he has the fewest. Too much depends on his every move. The tyrant’s choices are the narrowest of all. His life—the nation!— hangs in the balance. He can no longer drift or explore, join or flee. He cannot reinvent himself, because so many others depend on him—and he, in turn, must depend on so many others. He stops learning, because he is walled in by fortresses and palaces, by generals and ministers who rarely dare to tell him what he doesn’t wish to hear. Power gradually shuts the tyrant off from the world. Everything comes to him second-or thirdhand. He is deceived daily. He becomes ignorant of his land, his people, even his own family. He exists, finally, only to preserve his wealth and power, to build his legacy. Survival becomes his one overriding passion. So he regulates his diet, tests his food for poison, exercises behind well-patrolled walls, trusts no one, and tries to control everything

Saddam’s rise through the ranks may have been slow and deceitful, but when he moved to seize power, he did so very openly. He had been serving as vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, and as Vice President of Iraq, and he planned to step formally into the top positions. Some of the party leadership, including men who had been close to Saddam for years, had other ideas. Rather than just hand him the reins, they had begun advocating a party election. So Saddam took action. He staged his ascendancy like theater

On July 18, 1979, he invited all the members of the Revolutionary Command Council and hundreds of other party leaders to a conference hall in Baghdad. He had a video camera running in the back of the hall to record the event for posterity. Wearing his military uniform, he walked slowly to the lectern and stood behind two microphones, gesturing with a big cigar. His body and broad face seemed weighted down with sadness. There had been a betrayal, he said. A Syrian plot. There were traitors among them. Then Saddam took a seat, and Muhyi Abd al-Hussein Mashhadi, the secretary-general of the Command Council, appeared from behind a curtain to confess his own involvement in the putsch. He had been secretly arrested and tortured days before; now he spilled out dates, times, and places where the plotters had met. Then he started naming names. As he fingered members of the audience one by one, armed guards grabbed the accused and escorted them from the hall. When one man shouted that he was innocent, Saddam shouted back, “Itla! Itla!” – “Get out! Get out!” (Weeks later, after secret trials, Saddam had the mouths of the accused taped shut so that they could utter no troublesome last words before their firing squads.) When all of the sixty “traitors” had been removed, Saddam again took the podium and wiped tears from his eyes as he repeated the names of those who had betrayed him. Some in the audience, too, were crying—perhaps out of fear. This chilling performance had the desired effect. Everyone in the hall now understood exactly how things would work in Iraq from that day forward. The audience rose and began clapping, first in small groups and finally as one. The session ended with cheers and laughter. The remaining “leaders”—about three hundred in all—left the hall shaken, grateful to have avoided the fate of their colleagues, and certain that one man now controlled the destiny of their entire nation. Videotapes of the purge were circulated throughout the country

It was what the world would come to see as classic Saddam. He tends to commit his crimes in public, cloaking them in patriotism and in effect turning his witnesses into accomplices. The purge that day reportedly resulted in the executions of a third of the Command Council. (Mashhadi’s performance didn’t spare him; he, too, was executed.) During the next few weeks scores of other “traitors” were shot, including government officials, military officers, and people turned in by ordinary citizens who responded to a hotline phone number broadcast on Iraqi TV. Some Council members say that Saddam ordered members of the party’s inner circle to participate in this bloodbath.

What does Saddam want? By all accounts, he is not interested in money. This is not the case with the other members of his family. His wife, Sajida, is known to have gone on million-dollar shopping sprees in New York and London, back in the days of Saddam’s good relations with the West. Uday drives expensive cars and wears custom-tailored suits of his own design. Saddam himself isn’t a hedonist; he lives a well-regulated, somewhat abstemious existence. He seems far more interested in fame than in money, desiring above all to be admired, remembered, and revered. A nineteen-volume official biography is mandatory reading for Iraqi government officials, and Saddam has also commissioned a six hour film about his life, called The Long Days, which was edited by Terrence Young, best known for directly three James Bond films. Saddam told his official biographer that he isn’t interested in what people think of him today, only in what they will think of him in five hundred years. The root of Saddam’s bloody, single-minded pursuit of power appears to be simple vanity

But what extremes of vanity compel a man to jail or execute all who criticize or oppose him? To erect giant statues of himself to adorn the public spaces of his country? To commission romantic portraits, some of them twenty feet high, portraying the nation’s Great Uncle as a desert horseman, a wheat-cutting peasant, or a construction worker carrying bags of cement? To have the nation’s television, radio, film, and print devoted to celebrating his every word and deed? Can ego alone explain such displays? Might it be the opposite? What colossal insecurity and self-loathing would demand such compensation?

The sheer scale of the tyrant’s deeds mocks psychoanalysis. What begins with ego and ambition becomes a political movement. Saddam embodies first the party and then the nation. Others conspire in this process in order to further their own ambitions, selfless as well as selfish. Then the tyrant turns on them. His cult of self becomes more than a political strategy. Repetition of this image in heroic or paternal poses, repetition of his name, his slogans, his virtues, and his accomplishments, seeks to make his power seem inevitable, unchallengeable. Finally he is praised not out of affection or admiration but out of obligation. One must praise him.

Hadafuh (His Goal)

""You are the fountain of willpower and the wellspring of life, the essence of earth, the sabers of demise , the pupil of the eye, and the twitch of the eyelid. A people like you cannot but be, with God’s help. So be as you are, and as we are determined to be. Let all cowards, piggish people, traitors, and betrayers be debased"" . –Saddam Hussein, addressing the Iraqi people, July 17, 2001

Iraq is a land of antiquity. It is called the Land of Two Rivers (the Tigris and the Euphrates); the land of Sumerian kings, Mesopotamia and Babylon; one of the cradles of civilization. Walking the streets of Baghdad gives one a sense of continuity with things long past, of unity with the great sweep of history. Renovating and maintaining the old palaces is an ongoing project in the city. By decree, one of every ten bricks laid in the renovation of an ancient palace is now stamped either with the name Saddam Hussein or with an eight-pointed star (a point for each letter of his name spelled in Arabic.)

In 1987 Entifadh Qanbar was assigned to work on the restoration of the Baghdad Palace, which had once been called al-Zuhoor, or the Flowers Palace. Built in the 1930s for King Ghazi, it is relatively small and very pretty; English in style, it once featured an elaborate evergreen maze. Qanbar is an engineer by training, a short, fit, dark-haired man with olive skin. After earning his degree he served a compulsory term in the army, which turned out to be a five-year stint, and survived the mandatory onemonth tour on the front lines in the war with Iran.

Work on the palace had stalled some years earlier, when the British consultant for the project refused to come to Baghdad because of the war. One of Qanbar’s first jobs was to supervise construction of a high and ornate brick wall around the palace grounds. Qanbar is a perfectionist, and because the wall was to be decorative as well as functional, he took care with the placement of each brick. An elaborate gate had already been built facing the main road, but Qanbar had not yet built the portions of the wall on either side of it, because the renovation of the palace itself was unfinished, and that way large construction equipment could roll on and off the property without danger of damaging the gate

One afternoon at about five, as he was preparing to close down work for the day, Qanbar saw a black Mercedes with curtained windows and custom-built running boards pull up to the site. He knew immediately who was in it. Ordinary Iraqis were not allowed to drive such fancy cars. Cars like this one were driven exclusively by al Himaya, Saddam’s bodyguards. The doors opened and several guards stepped out. All of them wore dark-green uniforms, black berets, and zippered boots of reddish-brown leather. They had big moustaches like Saddam’s, and carried Kalashnikovs. To the frightened Qanbar, they seemed robotic, without human feelings

The bodyguards often visited the work site to watch and make trouble. Once, after new concrete had been poured and smoothed, some of them jumped into it, stomping through the patch in their red boots to make sure that no bomb or listening device was hidden there. Another time a workman opened a pack of cigarettes and a bit of foil wrapping fluttered down into the newly poured concrete. One of the guards caught a glimpse of something metallic and reacted as if someone had thrown a hand grenade. Several of them leaped into the concrete and retrieved the scrap. Angered to discover what it was, and to have been made to look foolish, they dragged the offending worker aside and beat him with their weapons. “I have worked all my life!” he cried. They took him away, and he did not return. So the sudden arrival of a black Mercedes was a frightening thing

“Who is the engineer here?” the chief guard asked. He spoke with the gruff Tikriti accent of his boss. Qanbar stepped up and identified himself. One of the guards wrote down his name. It is a terrible thing to have al Himaya write down your name. In a country ruled by fear, the best way to survive is todraw as little attention to yourself as possible. To be invisible. Even success can be dangerous, because it makes you stand out. It makes other people jealous and suspicious. It makes you enemies who might, if the opportunity presents itself, bring your name to the attention of the police. For the state to have your name for any reason other than the most conventional ones—school, driver’s license, military service—is always dangerous. The actions of the state are entirely unpredictable, and they can take away your career, your freedom, your life. Qanbar’s heart sank and his mouth went dry.

“Our Great Uncle has just passed by,” the chief guard began. “And he said, ‘Why is this gate installed when the two walls around it are not built?’”

Qanbar nervously explained that the walls were special, ornamental, and that his crew was saving them for last because of the heavy equipment coming and going. “We want to keep it a clean construction,” he said

“Our Great Uncle is going to pass by again tonight,” said the guard. “When he does, it must be finished.”

Qanbar was dumbfounded. “How can I do it?” he protested.

“I don’t know,” said the guard. “But if you don’t do it, you will be in trouble.” Then he said something that revealed exactly how serious the danger was: “And if you don’t do it, we will be in trouble. How can we help?”

There was nothing to do but try. Qanbar dispatched Saddam’s men to help round up every member of his crew as fast as they could—those who were not scheduled to work as well as those who had already gone home. Two hundred workers were quickly assembled. They set up floodlights. Some of the guards came back with trucks that had machine guns mounted on top. They parked alongside the work site and set up chairs, watching and urging more speed as the workers mixed mortar and threw down line after line of bricks

The crew finished at nine-thirty. They had completed in four hours a job that would ordinarily have taken a week. Terror had driven them to work faster and harder than they believed possible. Qanbar and his men were exhausted. An hour later they were still cleaning up the site when the black Mercedes drove up again. The chief guard stepped out. “Our Uncle just passed by, and he thanks you,” he said.

Walls define the tyrant’s world. They keep his enemies out, but they also block him off from the people he rules. In time he can no longer see out. He loses touch with what is real and what is unreal, what is possible and what is not—or, as in the case of Qanbar and the wall, what is just barely possible. His ideas of what his power can accomplish, and of his own importance, bleed into fantasy.

In what sense does Saddam see himself as a great man? Saad al-Bazzaz, who defect in 1992, has thought a lot about this question, during his time as a newspaper editor and TV producer in Baghdad, and in the years since, as the publisher of an Arabic newspaper in London.

“I need a piece of paper and a pen,” he told me recently in the lobby of Claridge’s Hotel. He flattened the paper out on a coffee table and tested the pen. Then he drew a line down the center. “You must understand, the daily behavior is just the result of the mentality,” he explained. “Most people would say that the main conflict in Iraqi society is sectarian, between the Sunni and the Shia Muslims. But the big gap has nothing to do with religion. It is between the mentality of the villages and the mentality of the cities.”

“Okay. Here is a village.” On the right half of the page al-Bazzaz wrote a V and beneath it he drew a collection of small squares. “These are houses or tents,” he said. “Notice there are spaces between them. This is because in the villages each family has its own house, and each house is sometimes several miles from the next one. They are self-contained. They grow their own food and make their own clothes. Those who grow up in the villages are frightened of everything. There is no real law enforcement or civil society. Each family is frightened of each other, and all of them are frightened of outsiders. This is the tribal mind. The only loyalty they know is to their own family, or to their own village. Each of the families is ruled by a patriarch, and the village is ruled by the strongest of them. This loyalty to tribe comes before everything. There are no values beyond power. You can lie, cheat, steal, even kill, and it is okay so long as you are a loyal son of the village or the tribe. Politics for these people is a bloody game, and it is all about getting or holding power.”

Al-Bazzaz wrote the word “city” atop the left half of the page. Beneath it he drew a line of adjacent squares. Below that he drew another line, and another. “In the city the old tribal ties are left behind. Everyone lives close together. The state is a big part of everyone’s life. They work at jobs and buy their food and clothing at markets and in stores. There are laws, police, courts, and schools. People in the city lose their fear of outsiders and take an interest in foreign things. Life in the city depends on cooperation, on sophisticated social networks. Mutual self-interest defines public policy. You can’t get anything done without cooperating with others, so politics in the city becomes the art of compromise and partnership. The highest goal of politics becomes cooperation, community, and keeping the peace. By definition, politics in the city becomes nonviolent. The backbone of urban politics isn’t blood, it’s law.”

In al-Bazzaz’s view, Saddam embodies the tribal mentality. “He is the ultimate Iraqi patriarch, the village leader who has seized a nation,” he explained. “Because he has come so far, he feels anointed by destiny. Everything he does is, by definition, the right thing to do. He has been chosen by Heaven to lead. Often in his life he has been saved by God, and each escape makes him more certain of his destiny. In recent years, in his speeches, he has begun using passages and phrases from the Koran, speaking the words as if they are his own. In the Koran, Allah says, ‘If you thank me, I will give you more.’ In the early nineties Saddam was on TV, presenting awards to military officers, and he said, ‘If you thank me, I will give you more.’ He no longer believes he is a normal person. Dialogue with him is impossible because of this. He can’t understand why journalists should be allowed to criticize him. How can they criticize the father of the tribe? This is something unacceptable in his mind. To him, strength is everything. To allow criticism or differences of opinion, to negotiate or compromise, to accede to the rule of law or to due process—these are signs of weakness.”

Qaswah (Cruelty)

""The flood has reached its climax and after the destruction, terror, murder, and sacrilege practiced by the aggressive, terrorist, and criminal Zionist entity, together with its tyrannical ally, the United States, have come to a head against our brothers and our faithful struggling people in plundered Palestine. If evil achieves its objectives there, Allah forbid, its gluttony for more will increase and it will afflict our people and other parts of our wide homeland too."" –Saddam Hussein, in a televised address to the Iraqi people, December 15, 2001

In the early 1980’s a midlevel Iraqi bureaucrat who worked in the Housing Ministry in Baghdad saw several of his colleagues accused by Saddam’s regime of accepting bribes. The accusations, he believes, were probably true. “There was petty corruption in our department,” he says. The accused were all sentenced to die

“All of us in the office were ordered to attend the hanging,” says the former bureaucrat, who now lives in London. “I decided I wasn’t going to go, but when my friends found out my plans, they called me and urged me to reconsider, warning that my refusal could turn suspicion on me.” So he went. He and the others from his office were led into a prison courtyard, where they watched as their colleagues and friends, with whom they had worked for years, with whose children their children played, with whom they had attended parties and picnics, were marched out with sacks tied over their heads. They watched and listened as the accused begged, wept, and protested their innocence from beneath the sacks. One by one they were hanged. The bureaucrat decided then and there to leave Iraq.

“I could not live in a country where such a thing takes place,” he says. “It is wrong to accept bribes, and those who do it should be punished by being sent to jail. But to hang them? And to order their friends and colleagues to come watch? No one who has witnessed such cruelty would willingly stay and continue to work under such conditions.”

Cruelty is the tyrant’s art. He studies and embraces it. His rule is based on fear, but fear is not enough to stop everyone. Some men and women have great courage. They are willing to brave death to oppose him. But the tyrant has ways of countering even this. Among those who do not fear death, some fear torture, disgrace, or humiliation. And even those who do not fear these things for themselves may fear them for their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, wives, and children. The tyrant uses all these tools. He commands not just acts of cruelty but cruel spectacle. So we have Saddam hanging the fourteen alleged Zionist plotters in 1969 in a public square and leaving their dangling bodies on display. So we have Saddam videotaping the purge in the Baghdad conference hall and sending the tape to members of his organization throughout the nation. So we have top party leaders forced to witness and even to participate in the executions of their colleagues. When Saddam cracks down on Shia clerics, he executes not just the mullahs but also their families. Pain and humiliation and death become public theater. Ultimately, guilt or innocence doesn’t matter, because there is no law or value beyond the tyrant’s will; if he wants someone arrested, tortured, tried, and executed, that is sufficient. The exercise not only serves as warning, punishment, or purge but also advertises to his subjects, his enemies, and his potential rivals that he is strong. Compassion, fairness, concern for due process or the law, are all signs of indecision. Indecision means weakness. Cruelty asserts strength

Among the Zulu, tyrants are said to be “full of blood.” According to one estimate, in the third and fourth years of Saddam’s formal rule (1981 and 1982) more than three thousand Iraqis were executed. Saddam’s horrors over the more than thirty years of his informal and formal rule will someday warrant a museum and archives. But lost among the most outrageous atrocities are smaller acts that shed light on his personality. Tahir Yahya was the Prime Minister of Iraq when the Baath Party took power in 1968. It is said that in 1964, when Saddam was in prison, Yahya had arranged for a personal meeting and tried to coerce him into turning against the Baathists and cooperating with the regime. Yahya had served Iraq as a military officer his whole adult life and had at one time even been a prominent member of the Baath Party, one of Saddam’s superiors. But he had earned Saddam’s enduring scorn. After seizing power, Saddam had Yahya, a well-educated man whose sophistication he resented, confined to prison. On his orders Yahya was assigned to push a wheelbarrow from cell to cell, collecting the prisoners’ slop buckets. He would call out “Rubbish! Rubbish!” The former Prime Minister’s humiliation was a source of delight to Saddam until the day Yahya died, in prison. He still likes to tell the story, chuckling over the words “Rubbish! Rubbish!”

In another case Lieutenant General Omar al-Hazzaa was overheard speaking ill of the Great Uncle in 1990. He was not just sentenced to death. Saddam ordered that prior to his execution his tongue be cut out; for good measure, he also executed al-Hazzaa’s son, Farouq. Al-Hazzaa’s homes were bulldozed, and his wife and other children left on the street.

Saddam is realistic about the brutal reprisals that would be unleashed should he ever lose his grip on power. In their book Out of the Ashes (1999), Andrew and Patrick Cockburn tell of a family that complained to Saddam that one of their members had been unjustly executed. He was unapologetic, and told them, “Do not think you will get revenge. If you ever have the chance, by the time you get to us there will not be a sliver of flesh left on our bodies.” In other words, if he ever becomes vulnerable, his enemies will quickly devour him

Even if Saddam is right that greatness is his destiny, his legend will be colored by cruelty. If it is something he sees as regrettable, perhaps, but necessary—a trait that defines his stature. A lesser man would lack the stomach for it. His son Uday once boasted to a childhood playmate that he and his brother, Qusay, had been taken to prisons by their father to witness torture and executions—to toughen them up for “the difficult tasks ahead,” he said.

Yet no man is without contradictions. Even Saddam has been known to grieve over his excesses. Some who saw him cry at the lectern during the 1979 purge dismiss it as a performance, but Saddam has a history of bursting into tears. In the wave of executions following his formal assumption of power, according to Saïd Aburish’s biography, he locked himself in his bedroom for two days and emerged with eyes red and swollen from weeping. Aburish reports that Saddam then paid a brazen though apparently sincere condolence call on the family of Adnan Hamdani, the executed official who had been closest to him during the previous decade. He expressed not remorse—the execution was necessary—but sadness. He told Hamdani’s widow apologetically that “national considerations” must outweigh personal ones. So on occasion, at least, Saddam the person laments what Saddam the tyrant must do. During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln drew a sharp distinction between what he personally would do—abolish slavery—and what his office required him to do: uphold the Constitution and the Union. Saddam ought to feel no such conflict; by definition, the interests of the state are his own. But he does

As Saddam approaches his sixty-sixth birthday, his enemies are numerous, strong, and determined. He celebrated the 1992 electoral defeat of George Bush by firing a gun from a palace balcony. Ten years later a new President Bush is in the White House, with a new national mission to remove Saddam. So the walls that protect the tyrant grow higher and higher. His dreams of pan-Arabia and his historical role in it grow ever more fanciful. In his clearer moments Saddam must know that even if he manages to hang on to power for the remainder of his life, the chances of his fathering a dynasty are slim. As he retreats to his secret bed each night, sitting up to watch a favorite movie on TV or to read one of his history books, he must know it will end badly for him. Any man who reads as much as he does, and who studies the studies the dictators of modern history, knows that in the end they are all toppled and disdained.

“His aim was to be leader of Iraq forever, for as long as he lives,” Samarai says. “This is a difficult task, even without the United States targeting you. The Iraqis are a divided and ruthless people. It is one of the most difficult nations in the world to govern. To accomplish his own rule, Saddam has shed so much blood. If his aim is for his power to be transferred to his family after his death, I think this is far into the realm of wishful thinking. But I think he lost touch with reality in that sense long ago.”

This, ultimately, is why Saddam will fail. His cruelty has created great waves of hatred and fear, and it has also isolated him. He is out of step. His speeches today play like a broken record. They no longer resonate even in the Arab world, where he is despised by secular liberals and Muslim conservatives alike. In Iraq itself he is universally hated. He blames the crippling of the state on UN sanctions and U.S. hostility, but Iraqis understand that he is the cause of it. “Whenever he would start in blaming the Americans for this and that, for everything, we would look at each other and roll our eyes,” says Sabah Khalifa Khodada, the former Iraqi major who was stripped and decontaminated for a meeting with the Great Uncle. The forces that protect him known this too—they do not live full-time behind the walls. Their loyalty is governed by fear and self-interest, and will tilt decisively if and when an alternative appears. The key to ending Saddam’s tyranny is to present such an alternative. It will not be easy. Saddam will never give up. Overthrowing him will almost certainly mean killing him. He guards his hold on the state as he guards his own life. There is no panic in his fight.

And so Saddam champions the simple virtues of a glorious Arab past, and dreams that his kingdom, though universally scorned and defiled, will rise again and triumph. Like the good king, he is vital in a way that will not be fully understood until he is gone. Only then will we all study the words and deeds of this magnificent, defiant soul. He awaits his moment of triumph in a district, glorious future that mirrors a distant, glorious past.

""On March 17, 2003, President Bush gave Saddam his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq. The ultimatum was rejected. U.S. forces entered Baghdad on April 9, 2003, toppling a huge statue of Saddam to the cheering of Iraqi residents. On July 22, 2003, Saddam’s two sons are killed in a gun battle with U.S. troops. On December 13, 2003, Saddam is captured by U.S. troops in the town of Adwar in a specially prepared “spider hole.” After firing his 1,500-member defense team, keeping only one Iraqi attorney, Saddam pleads innocent to charges of murder and torture and questions the legitimacy of the Iraqi Special Tribunal appointed to prosecute war crimes committed during Saddam’s rule. Throughout the span of two trials, Saddam remains defiant, often shouting “Down with Bush,” repeating accusations that he’d been beaten while in U.S. custody, or refusing to appear in court at all. On November 5, 2006, Saddam and two co-defendants are sentenced to death for the deaths of 148 Shiite Muslims in the town of Dujail. He is found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder. On December 30, 2006, Saddam is taken to the gallows and hanged""",2,1759558270.0,redscarepod,0,1.0,False

I wanna hug them and throttle them. Both. Simultaneously.

These people wake up at 3 AM with an idea, slam two coffees, and ship a product that somehow works half the time and breaks the other half. They’re equal parts genius and absolute lunatic. They speak like angels  “we’re building the future”.

I love them because they actually try. They don’t wait for permission. They don’t wait for VC validation or some five-page spreadsheet. They say “screw it,” push to production, and pray the error logs are honest today. That hustle is pure art. They make things that didn’t exist yesterday. That’s badass.

And the slang for their work is wild: “we onboarded 200 users,” but actually 150 are your friends, 30 are testers, and 20 are bots pretending to be users because analytics is hard. Launch-day tweets = PR wins. Launch-day infra collapse = character building. They celebrate every tiny metric like it’s a moon landing, then patch a security hole with duct tape and curse.

All these Million Dollar Startups like Smallest.ai bragging about latency like it’s a Nobel. You see Emergent flexing “build apps by prompt” like it’s magic while the UI still makes you feel nostalgic for Windows 98. You see Merlin turning browsers into control centers and people clapping because search finally listens. Sarvam AI promises a desi GPT and people treat it like a national sport. Exampredict quietly predicts exams and students lose sleep wondering if the algorithm is a witch or a god.

So here’s my unfiltered message to new founders:
I love that you’re reckless. I love that you break things faster than suits can say “due diligence.” Keep doing that. Build the weird. Make mistakes publicly. Ship ugly MVPs. Burn through the nonsense. The world needs your stupid, beautiful experiments. But also, please stop acting like every MVP is a movement. ",1,1759558146.0,india,0,0.67,False

- consistent 8-10 hours of sleep every night. when i sleep less, nothing is different, i don't feel more awake, i don't feel more tired, just neutral
- i never nap. before this year the last time i can remember napping was high school (im a second year uni student) and i just woke up from one.

2.  diet
- im a gym rat so i am very diet focused. lots of protein, lots of fibre, good carb intake. 

*carbs*

i dont usually have carbs in the morning except fruit. i usually stick with the same breakfast, two eggs, avocado and a fruit (apple or banana). for lunch i try to have something with carbs but i found myself unable to eat pasta, breads, rice or noodles this year. i still have them occasionally.

the last few weeks ive been having oats in the morning and the last few months i sometimes have a cheeky scone on the side of two eggs. but this week i literally have one scone and havent eaten anything since. no eggs, no fruit, and im not hungry. but i can no longer eat eggs, theyre like really gross to me all of a sudden so i just eat carbs for breakfast now (a scone or oats and a fruit).

*protein*

high protein diet, 100g + and im 61kg. i try not to get it from artificial things, and i cant afford protein powder anyway. i love red meat, white meat, and fish. i always try to have lots of protein with my meals as it keeps me full and satiated.

that is no longer happening. i cant eat and im finding my protein is like maybe 40g a day (at least this week).

*fats*

i try to have a low fat diet but its not very strict. i like my avocado but limit myself, thats really it.

*micronutrients*

i love fruit and i love vegetables. i always have an apple AND a banana a day. sometimes an orange or kiwi or passionfruit for that vitamin C. i had a blood test recently and all my levels are fine except creatine which was a little high and im in the process of fixing it

3. social media

i dont scroll social media. my screen time for instagram is ~30-60mins a day. i try to spend my day playing piano or reading or exercising. when im tired, i actually try to relax instead of always keeping my brain stimulated. i understand to take it slow and be natural.

4. miscellaneous

i'm female and autistic. im tired on my period, after my period, before my period, my hormones dont make it any different.

i am NOT depressed. im not sad, at least that i know of.

i am NOT stressed. i feel very zen right now. no assignments, no exams, just taking life on a stroll. if anything im more awake stressed but even stressed i still take 8-10 hours of sleep and eat three meals a day.

as for hunger, i used to be so upset and cry the week before my period because i was just SO HUNGRY all the time. it was this insatiable hunger that was NEVER satisfied. i was eating and eating and eating and never satisfied. but then once i started the cycle, i was fine again and still eating 2-3 meals a day with lots of carbs for fuel (as it can be quiet heavy).

5. overall hunger

i used to be the hungriest b*ch on the block. im the biggest back to have ever backed in my family. im ripped with muscle and i dont care about being super skinny, i just care about keeping my temple healthy. i am lean, not bulky, i believe i have a very healthy body. although i'm on the heavier side, it's because i have so much muscle. j have an hourglass figure with abs, huge lats and biceps and shoulders and solid quads, hamstrings and calves (with help from my physio).

now im eating maybe one meal a day. i dont know whats happening.  i ate one scone for breakfast, had a coffee, three dumplings at 2 o'clock which i felt sick eating. its 4pm? by now i would have eaten two good solid meals and a sweet treat foe desert. i dont even think i'll be hungry for dinner. the same thing happened yesterday and the day before.

I'm hoping to get something that, once dialed in, can pull fairly consistent shots back-to-back without needing to manually weight each shot. Initiailly I thought I'd go with a Bambino Plus, but the huge inconsistency between shots that people have been posting about has put me off it.

I'm wondering if I would be better looking at something like the Oracle Jet, or at least something that removes most of the variability of manually distributing and tamping.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums are gaining a lot of popularity because they blend the charm of a barn with the comforts of a modern home. If you’re considering making a move into a 2-bedroom barndominium, you’re in for a treat. These innovative designs offer flexibility, functionality, and a unique living experience. Let’s explore some remarkable floor plans for modern living.

### Wide Open Spaces

One of the key features of modern barndominium design is the open floor plan. This layout connects the kitchen, dining, and living areas, creating a spacious feel that is both inviting and cozy. With fewer walls, you have more room to entertain guests or enjoy family activities. Consider a layout where:

- The kitchen island serves as a focal point for cooking and gathering.
- Large windows allow natural light to flood the space, making it feel even larger.
- The dining area flows seamlessly into the living room, perfect for hosting dinners and get-togethers.

### Functional Bedroom Layouts

In a 2-bedroom barndominium, it’s essential to make the most of the space available. Each bedroom can be designed with efficiency in mind. For instance:

- Utilize built-in storage solutions to maximize space.
- Incorporate en-suite bathrooms for added privacy and convenience.
- Consider a layout where both bedrooms are situated away from the main living areas, ensuring peace and quiet.

This creates a relaxing retreat, allowing you to unwind after a long day.

### Outdoor Integration

Modern living often includes a strong connection with the outdoors. Many 2-bedroom barndominium floor plans embrace this by incorporating outdoor spaces. Think about having:

- A covered porch that expands your living space and allows for outdoor dining.
- Lounging areas where you can enjoy your morning coffee or evening sunsets.
- Easy access to a backyard or garden space for those who love to nurture plants or entertain outside.

This integration can make your home feel larger and bring a sense of tranquility to your living experience.

### Sustainable Features

As more people are becoming environmentally conscious, many modern barndominiums are being designed with sustainability in mind. If sustainability is important to you, look for floor plans that include:

- Energy-efficient windows and insulation to help reduce heating and cooling costs.
- Solar panels on the roof to harness renewable energy.
- Materials sourced from local suppliers to minimize transportation emissions.

These features not only benefit the environment but also create a cost-effective living situation.

### Versatile Spaces

Another innovative aspect of 2-bedroom barndominium designs is their versatility. Many homeowners are looking for multi-purpose spaces that can adapt as their needs change over time. You can achieve this by:

- Designing a second bedroom that can function as a home office or craft room.
- Murphy beds or futons that allow rooms to serve dual purposes.
- Using movable partitions to change the layout as your family grows or your lifestyle evolves.

The ability to transform spaces according to your needs can be a game-changer in modern living.

### Modern Aesthetics

The aesthetic of barndominiums is another reason they’re so appealing. Many choose to go with a minimalist and contemporary look. You can create a stunning home by:

- sleek finishes and clean lines throughout the design.
- Choosing neutral color palettes that can be accented with personal touches.
- Using industrial materials like steel and wood that reflect the barndominium's heritage.

The result is a stylish, modern home that doesn’t compromise on comfort or functionality.

Choosing a 2-bedroom barndominium allows you to customize a dwelling that fits your lifestyle while embracing innovative designs. From functional layouts to sustainable features, there's no shortage of possibilities that can transform your living experience into something truly special.

Benefits of Choosing a Barndominium Layout for Small Families
-------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right home layout is essential, especially for small families. One trendy solution that has gained popularity is the barndominium layout. A barndominium combines the sturdy structure of a barn with the comfort of a home, providing a unique living space that suits modern needs. Here are several benefits that make barndominiums an excellent choice for small families.

### Spaciousness

The open concept design of a barndominium creates an illusion of more space. Unlike traditional homes with walls and separate rooms, a barndominium allows for a more fluid layout. This spaciousness fosters family interaction, making it easier for parents to supervise children while they engage in activities throughout the home. Whether you are cooking in the kitchen, relaxing in the living area, or working from home, the design promotes togetherness without feeling cramped.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Building or purchasing a barndominium is often more affordable compared to traditional homes. This affordability allows small families to invest their savings in other necessary areas, such as education or vacations. Key factors contributing to the lower costs include:

- Simple structures that require less material
- Reduced maintenance expenses due to durable materials
- Lower utility costs thanks to energy-efficient designs

By saving money in these areas, families can redirect funds toward creating a comfortable and enjoyable life.

### Energy Efficiency

Modern barndominiums often come with energy-efficient features that help reduce energy bills. Proper insulation, high-quality windows, and energy-efficient appliances can significantly lower heating and cooling costs. This is especially beneficial for small families, as they usually operate on a budget. Understanding how to manage energy expenses helps teach children valuable lessons about financial responsibility and sustainability.

### Customization Opportunities

One of the most exciting aspects of building a barndominium is the chance to customize your home. Families can design personal spaces that reflect their lifestyle preferences. Small families may prefer to include:

- Multi-functional rooms that serve various purposes (like a guest room that can also act as an office)
- Outdoor living spaces for family gatherings or play areas for children
- Efficient storage solutions to keep the living area organized and tidy

This level of customization allows families to create their dream home in a way that standard houses can’t always accommodate.

### Durability and Low Maintenance

Barndominiums are constructed from durable materials, such as metal or wood, that can withstand harsh weather conditions. This durability translates into less maintenance, providing peace of mind for busy families. Spending less time on repairs means you can focus more on creating lasting memories with your loved ones. Moreover, many of these materials are resistant to fire, pests, and rot, ensuring your family’s safety and comfort.

### Unique Style

Barndominiums offer a distinct architectural style that stands out from traditional homes. Their rustic charm combined with modern aesthetics provides an attractive living space. Small families can express their individuality through design choices, like selecting unique colors, fixtures, and landscaping. This uniqueness contributes to a more personalized environment, coupling functionality with fashion.

### Community Integration

Barndominiums are often built in rural or semi-rural areas, allowing small families to connect with nature and the community. This setting can foster strong relationships with neighbors and local residents, enhancing family life. Living in proximity to nature also provides numerous opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, or simply enjoying the fresh air. It’s a great way for small families to bond and create shared experiences together.


Selecting a barndominium layout is a practical choice for small families that prioritizes space, affordability, and a connection to the community. With numerous customization options and energy-efficient designs, barndominiums adapt well to the ever-evolving needs of a family. Embrace the flexibility and charm of a barndominium; your small family will surely thrive in this innovative living space.

### Conclusion

Choosing a 2 bedroom barndominium floor plan can profoundly enhance your living experience, especially for small families. With their innovative designs, barndominiums combine functionality with aesthetic appeal, offering a modern twist on traditional living spaces. Imagine enjoying open layouts that seamlessly connect your living, dining, and kitchen areas, creating a warm environment for family gatherings or entertaining friends.

The benefits of opting for a barndominium layout extend beyond just the unique style. These structures are typically more affordable to build than conventional homes, allowing you to allocate more of your budget to high-quality materials and contemporary finishes. Additionally, the energy efficiency of barndominiums often leads to lower utility bills, making them a prudent choice for small families who want to save on monthly expenses.

Moreover, the flexibility in design means you can tailor the floor plan to suit your family’s specific needs. Whether you need extra storage, a dedicated workspace, or an outdoor patio to enjoy summer evenings, barndominium layouts can be personalized to enhance comfort and lifestyle.

When considering innovative 2 bedroom barndominium floor plans, you are not just choosing a home; you are opting for a lifestyle that embraces modern living while focusing on sustainability and practicality. With thoughtful design, these homes can cater perfectly to the dynamics of small families, blending comfort, style, and functionality under one roof. The journey to your dream home starts here—with a layout that reflects your modern family needs.",1,1759556576.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

It had an Intel i7 and a lower tier dedicated graphics card which I definitely felt the limitations of and would want to upgrade this go around. And the battery life was god awful (a mistake I REALLY don’t want to repeat). Really looking for something to serve as a reliable daily driver for writing, video streaming and occasional gaming. 

Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:
-$1500 to $2000 USD

Are you open to refurbs/used?
-Yes

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?
-In order of priority: build quality, performance, battery life, and form factor. I love the build of MacBooks, but not thrilled about the restrictions of the OS and gaming. Would love a balance between performance and battery life. My Zenbook kept a terrible charge almost out of the box and I’d like to not repeat that mistake. 

How important is weight and thinness to you?
-Moderately, so long as it isn’t a chore to lug it with me to a coffee shop occasionally.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.
-My last machine was a 14” and I feel like it threads the needle of portability and readability, but anything smaller than a 16” works. 

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.
-Primarily Chrome, Video/Music streaming, writing/document software. Beyond that, occasional gaming and emulation.

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?
-Some gaming but mostly indie or older titles—if it can run something like the Witcher 3 at 60fps then I’m absolutely all set. Moving more and more into cloud gaming on Xbox or NVIDIA.

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?
-I’m a writer so a good keyboard is a must have. I enjoy the quality of full metal construction. Touch screen I can take or leave.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I've been talking to this guy for more than a month now. Sept. 1st unang message nya sakin. I won't tell much details on how we met because someone might know ""us"". The first two weeks was boring tho we've shared common interests, the convo was always *shallow*, no deep conversation. Palaging ""wyd"", ""kumusta work"" at ""kumain ka na ba?"". Until napag usapan namin na manood ng movie online -- shared screen and off cam kami, and nasundan nang isa pang movie. He asks for a lunch out, coffee dates, a casual meet up, but I always declined because I'm not ready for meet ups. I'm always clear about it, palagi kong sinasabi sa kanya na ayoko muna makipag kita, he agreed. But one time, dahil comfy na kami mag usap naging open na sya sa gusto na nya kong makita, then I snapped.

* sabi ko tumigil na kami sa pag uusap, nag message sya sa IG, we had an agreement na hindi nya ipipilit.

* we're back at watching movies again, but this time naka open na yung camera. *I was distracted the whole time kasi he was checking on me, and I was doing the same*. He said he's very happy after namin manood. Masaya din ako. :) 

* sending selfies, sending memes/reels from IG, or we were talking sa IG at sa isang app, sharing childhood stories and such, and still no one knows about us. That's fine, not a big deal.

He had an emergency, I know he's not okay, and I was trying to comfort him, to support him, na mag ingat sa mga words ko para hindi madagdagan yung iniisip nya however, I'm still firm with my decision na hindi pa rin ako makikipag kita sakanya, kasi para sakin kaya ko naman na iparamdam sakanya na *nandito ako* para sayo kahit hindi ako magpakita sakanya. I said, he can talk to me, that he can be honest with me. Pero eto na nga, last Thursday, I had a bad day, pressure at pagod sa work nang marinig ko na naman yung word na ""punta ka na sakin"", na trigger na ko sabihin sa kanya na hindi ko sya maintindihan, na clear naman ako sakanya, he said sorry again, pero ang nasabi ko nalang sakanya na ""Alam kong hindi ka okay, pero clear naman ako sayo. Palagi.""

***Seen.***
No response. 
He viewed my IG story but no reply.
I gave him until midnight, sabi ko kapag wala pang message ibablock ko na sya sa lahat ng account ko. 

Abyg, kasi hindi ko naintindihan na meron syang pinagdadaanan, and ganon pa sinabi ko sakanya? Abyg, kasi hindi ko sya macomfort in person? 

Blocked pa rin sya, no ways to reach me, unless mag chat sya sa *GC*. Lol.

I’m not looking for anything weird, just real friendships that actually last. I love talking about random stuff for hours especially politics!, sharing music, sending memes, or just having deep 2am conversations about life. I spend way too much time scrolling, drinking iced coffee, and daydreaming about travelling somewhere new (bonus points if you love talking about places you want to visit too).

I honestly don’t care where you’re from — different perspectives make it more interesting. I just want someone who’s kind, open-minded, and actually replies instead of ghosting after two messages 😅

The hospital is lively and bright, until I walk into my ward and pick up my assignment.

""Micheaaal, congratulations you get to sit on your ass all night. I'm putting you on the ""click buttons and get paid for it"" unit"" *he chuckles*

""Very professional""

""The Temporarily Unliving Simulated Humans unit, you try saying that three times."" *he rolls his eyes and walks away*

The TUSH unit, the unit where families who could not afford treatment can have their family members bodies frozen and brains stimulated for data collection at a lower price. Recently they changed it to just below freezing, families pay extra to avoid the slow but permanant decompasition. Not many people end up being thawed out. 

Anyways, memories are played out and then data is collected by the program. I just monitor for errors and hit ""accept or deny"". I do get to watch some of them which makes this unit go slightly faster than the others.

So I walk in, open up a coke and get to it

For the first few hours, most memories were basic, first loves, traumatic events, then things took a turn. What we call ""false memories"". People were having memories that could not belong to them, a 4 year old who committed a brutal murder, the housewife who robbed a store, A 90 year old man who went skydiving. 

*Deny, clicked for the first false memory data request*

*Deny overruled, please collect data sample from Janie Benson to continue*

""Damn this thing""

I stuck a needledrive into Janie, extracting from the active part in an attempt to prove that her current memory is not the one logged in the system. But when I did, I realized I wasn't wearing my gloves, it stuck me in the thumb. I felt myself commiting the murder, and then, saw ME in the mirror and then, I was murdered too. And then... 

*a woman sits at her desk, watching a computer*

""This guy is SO annoying, he keeps reaching above 90% reality saturation in like, milliseconds. 

*shrug* I'm sure he can't be having too much fun, he did some terrible things*

“I’ve already got enough. He’s on loop twelve. I’m ready to override his branch and move on.”

""Reprompting without resetting?""

""He'll be fine, he can be reset next shift""

""And then, I was back walking into the ward, into the unit, whatever choice I make, I end up like this. It's been so long.

""Micheal, do that manual sample, get another coffee and stop wasting my time or it's your ASS"" *he yells*

Why Are All Meetups at Night or in Pubs?,"I’ve been wanting to make some new friends lately since I haven’t really been able to connect with anyone at my workplace. So, I started looking for social events and community groups online. Someone suggested I try the Meetup app, and it did look promising at first, there are plenty of weekend gatherings and social mixers.

But here’s the problem: almost every single event happens at night, usually in pubs or at BYOB parties that start post 8 PM. I don’t drink or smoke, and my parents aren’t comfortable with me staying out that late. On top of that, most of these meetups seem to be happening around HSR Layout, which is quite far from North Bangalore.

Is this just how social life works here? Are there any daytime or non-pub meetups around the central or northern parts of the city? It’d be nice to have some chill, daytime hangouts like a brunch, board games, a walk in Cubbon Park, or just a casual coffee meetup.

Would love to know if anyone here feels the same or knows about such groups!",5,1759555725.0,BangaloreSocial,6,1.0,False

So here I am open to connecting with people who are chill, respectful, and just fun to be around. Whether it’s casual hangouts, grabbing a coffee, or even building long-term friendships, I’m all up for it.

The world stretched before me, slow and unaware,  
but my heart had already stumbled toward you.

Coffee grew cold in my hands,  
the city hummed past my window,  
and I thought —  
how strange that distance can’t untangle the pull of you,  
how mornings remember you before I even do.

Even in silence, even in absence,  
you are the weight I wake with,  
the rhythm beneath my chest,  
the quiet ache I carry into every day.

I'm a 25M in Bangalore with a super cheerful and positive outlook, looking to find a genuine connection with a female to explore the amazing cafe scene the city has to offer.

​☕ About Me
​I'm easy-going, love laughing, and bring genuinely fun energy to any hang-out. Think less awkward small talk, more immediate good times.


​🀄The Plan
My goal is to find someone to check out new spots with—from the cozy hidden gems to the popular aesthetic cafes. I'm looking for someone who appreciates a good latte and a lively chat.
Beyond coffee, I enjoy reading, exploring different parts of the city (especially historical ones), and getting into deep, thoughtful conversations as much as silly banter.
​Quick note—I'm vegetarian, so I'm always on the lookout for places with killer veggie/vegan options. If you know a great spot, I'm all ears!


​🎯 What I’m Looking For
​Someone who is also looking for a platonic friendship, activity partner, or potentially more if the chemistry is right.
​You should be equally cheerful, non-judgmental, and open to trying a random new cafe every weekend.
Living or working in Bangalore is a must.
​
​If you're interested in grabbing a coffee and seeing if we click, please DM me and include the following:
​Your Age and General Area of Bangalore.
​Your favorite cafe in the city and why you love it.
​A little bit about what you do for fun!


​Looking forward to hearing from you!",1,1759555682.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1nxljvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1nxljvd/not_just_your_workplace_supervisor/,Not just your workplace supervisor...,"Comments on another subforum's post recently dredged up my nightmarish memories of this situation...

Years ago I had a supervisor who, if she was on a diet, put all her underlings on a diet along with her.

Like I'd go make another cup of coffee midmorning and ""Sandra"" would pass by my desk, frowning at my sugar packets. ""SUGAR??"" she'd say, with this look on her face like she'd caught me trying to burn the building down. ""Sugar is NOT good for us, SnarkySheep.""

(Neither is constantly behaving like you're the parent of adult employees, which is a large part of why I finally transferred to another department soon after...)

But if Sandra decided it was a ""naughty"" day, of course she'd eat whatever, and because she was in charge and you weren't, the deities help anyone who would dare speak up.

She was the world's biggest micromanager as well as hypocrite. If anyone ever dared take a personal call or look as if they were glancing at anything personal, even for the briefest moment, they'd be sure to hear about it. But one day, Sandra decided to design and print out invites for her mother's upcoming big-number birthday bash (office color printer, y'know?)

And how do I know about it? Because Sandra's computer skills were almost non-existent. She actually had the nerve to *ask for help* with her invites.

I could literally write a book about this woman and all the unhinged, nasty things she said and did. 

(And in case you might think she was one of those unpleasant people who somehow don't know how they're actually coming across, that was not the case. At one point, she actually said out loud that ""if employees don't like me, that means I'm doing a good job as supervisor."")

Some time after I managed to escape from that department, I heard through the organization grapevine that Sandra had retired. I was surprised, as it was the custom to give everyone leaving, regardless of the circumstances or how unpopular they might have been, some sort of goodbye party or lunch, which would include an email announcing their departure sent to everyone. I hadn't heard of anything, so of course my first thought was that I had simply missed hearing about it. 

But no. As I was able to confirm later, the few people in Sandra's department that she hadn't managed to send into early retirement or transfer had all agreed they were not going to put time and effort into planning any sort of event celebrating a woman that had put them down, again and again and again. 

My initial thought was a moment of pity for Sandra, because I am at heart a kind person. It must have been humiliating, her leaving without even a single word of well-wishes from anyone, and a department head, at that. But then my immediate second thought was that she literally *made* this happen for herself. It was a huge example of FAFO. ",23,1759555536.0,EntitledPeople,3,1.0,False

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers… this, this is what I’ve been missing.

The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(“Not all those who wander are lost” – Tolkien.)

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists.
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul.
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses.
Argue over which villain actually had a point.
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity.
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much.
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get.
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping.
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.

1nxlhii,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverDisease/comments/1nxlhii/this_is_super_annoying/,This is super annoying,"A year and a half ago my ALT, AST, and ALP were all trending downward. I gained a little weight through the rest of 2024 without doing anything different (I have been gaining weight for years without being able to pinpoint any difference in diet or activity but whatever), and then in Jan of this year I had a full hysterectomy and entered menopause because of it. Boom, like 20 more pounds. 

In the last two months I’ve changed my diet as much as I can without going overboard (or it’ll never stick) and have drunk coffee every day like my gastro practically prescribed … and I’m just gaining more weight and my levels have shot up again. According to my biopsy I have stage two fatty liver with scarring. My insurance won’t cover the medication to help prevent more scarring (trying to fight that though) and my doctor is pushing a GLP-1 so much that I’m beginning to think I actually need it. I really don’t want that because of the side effects but I’m so discouraged I don’t know what to do.

I grew up without parents(dead mother absent father) and had several traums including minor sexual abuse. 
You all know how traums affects childhood and teenage and adulthood as well.
I have weed and smoking addiction 1 pack a day.
In addition to all of above I have small penis as well which is 4 inches I have never even kissed anyone due to this.
Never received love from anyone not from a woman or from the family. At present I don't any friends as well I love alone go for coffee alone.

 I crave love and connection like a fish craves for water. In the last 10 years many women showed interest in me they even made first move and gave clear signals. I would filrt with them and have conversation while building that tension. In back of my mind I always fucking thought somehow my dick would grow and my face would appear less weird that I will eat right and hit gym and have good sleep and that my hormone will fix and it will grow. Nor did I do those right things nor it did grow.
This has been going on for last 10 years. Honestly speaking atleast 20 girls showed interest in my through conversations and their gaze it appeared most of them wanted a real and long term connection. But I had this fear the moment it's time to get intimate she will laugh and leave. Also I always felt like a child which is little better now after I hit 30.
I get extreme negative thoughts which effected my studies and jobs. I don't any real practiced skills at the moment. I always wanted a family and nice home and peaceful life and I am ready to give all for it.
Also since I have weed addiction and lived in isolation I can't handle the conversation when it is about me or my life or career etc etc. I feel no woman will stay with me since I am immature scared. I know all the rights things I need to do but I just can't do it. I don't know what's stopping me it's like a fucking invisible force if I try to take one step ahead my mother fucking thoughts pulls me backwards 4 steps.
I recently started gym watched too many reels on this winter arc shit thought it's going to be different this time but it's fucking same always same. 

I don't think its entirely in my hands, I have never had a good night sleep since I am 10. It's very often. That I had good sleep without taking weed or alcohol. What can I do if I can't sleep? It's not my control? I lived in boarding schools and we had no screens there and had to wake up at 5 am everyday still i would take hours to sleep maybe have anywhere between 2-5 hour sleep. This bad sleeping in my childhood and teenage fucked up with my hormones. Which effected life un long term.

Recently, I had 3 girls at my job they were really nice and 2 of them for sure wanted a l9ng term relationship 1 one of them even told me that she wanted to start a family with me and she was on senior position. But I did thr same thing again left her on the cliff and other two as well. I did start gym goes between 1 to 3 days and some times I eat right. Could feel the difference in my body and that feeling of strong Ness. But then again some nights I get only 1 or 2 hour sleep and I can't do anything following day. How can I start a family at this point when my own life is not sorted ? Also how can I fix it without having a real connection ? Without having the sense of safety while lying down on a bed?
Done therapy already and it helped 20 % which us huge for me.

And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).

Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.

You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists.
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul.
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses.
Argue over which villain actually had a point.
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity.
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much.
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get.
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping.
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers… this, this is what I’ve been missing.
(“And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make” – The Beatles.)

So hey,

I’m 27. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(“Not all those who wander are lost” – Tolkien.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.

I've been using my mug warmer religiously for the past year, and I recently ran into an issue that I thought I'd share, along with how I fixed it. If you're dealing with an overheating mug warmer, this might help you out.

First off, I noticed my coffee was getting way too hot – like, borderline boiling. Not exactly what you want when you're trying to enjoy your morning brew! After some research and tinkering, I figured out several ways to fix this common problem.

1. Clean the Temperature Sensor
The first thing I discovered was that debris and coffee stains can mess with the temperature sensor. I carefully cleaned around the heating plate with a slightly damp cloth (make sure it's unplugged first!). This actually solved the problem for many users I talked to online.

2. Check the Power Settings
Most electric cup warmers have different temperature settings. Mine was accidentally set to the highest setting. Simply adjusting it to medium solved the overheating issue. If you're in the market for a new one, I recently got this awesome temperature-controlled model (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that works perfectly.

3. Inspect the Power Cord
Sometimes, a damaged cord can cause electrical issues leading to overheating. Check for any visible damage or fraying. If you spot any, it's time for a replacement. Safety first!

4. Use the Right Mug
This might sound obvious, but the type of mug matters! Thin-walled mugs heat up too quickly and can cause the warmer to work harder than necessary. I switched to a thicker ceramic mug, and it made a huge difference.

5. Consider Automatic Shut-off
If your current warmer doesn't have an auto shut-off feature, you might want to consider upgrading. I actually switched to this model (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) after my old one kept overheating, and the automatic shut-off has been a game-changer.

6. Regular Maintenance
I've learned that keeping your mug warmer clean and checking it regularly prevents most issues. I wipe mine down weekly and make sure there's no buildup around the heating element.

Quick Pro Tips:
- Always use a flat-bottomed mug
- Don't leave it on for more than 8 hours
- Keep it away from water and other liquids
- Place it on a level surface
- Let it cool down between uses

Remember, if none of these fixes work, it might be time to replace your warmer. These devices typically last 1-2 years with regular use. The good news is that newer models have better temperature control and safety features.

Hope this helps someone out there! Let me know if you have any questions or other tips to share. I'm always learning new things from this community!",1,1759555077.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nxlevs,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1nxlevs/116am/,1:16AM,"I don’t remember when eating became impossible. At first it was just skipping meals here and there, forgetting breakfast, pushing lunch off until it was too late. Now whole days pass without food and it doesn’t even register. My stomach growls but it feels far away, like someone else’s problem. I pour coffee, drink water, chew ice. Food feels like a burden, something too heavy to think about. 

The weight started falling off without my permission. Shirts hanging off my shoulders, bones starting to show in places they hadn't before. People say things, but it’s not discipline, it’s not control. It’s the opposite; a slow erosion, a body fading out while the mind stays trapped inside. Everything I used to enjoy feels distant now. Every hunger has dulled, leaving only a constant ache that’s intrinsically me. 

Some nights I catch my reflection and don’t recognize the person staring back. Hollow eyes, sunken cheeks, trembling hands, skin hanging off the frame like it’s waiting to be shed. I tell myself it’s temporary, that I’ll eat tomorrow, that I’ll get it together. But tomorrow comes, and the idea of food still feels like swallowing stones.

By this I detected I was terribly iron deficient. 

Now I am building an app that can detect causes of health episodes, anxiety, panic attacks and give plain reasons like '*60% of episodes occurred 2 hours after coffee.'*

It works as a wearable system that combines wearable ring for stress detection (like smart watches, easier to wear) with smart glasses that capture short moments when stress is detected by ring, summarize it (videos instantly deleted for privacy reasons) and generate high level hypothesis

If possibly, I’d love feedback:

* Does this sound useful?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1nxl7ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1nxl7ep/concerned_step_cat_mom/,Concerned Step Cat Mom,"I apologize in advance for the BOOK I’m about to write for you but I’m concerned for my girl and don’t know what the right next steps are.

Let me preface this with my husband adopted his cat, Moon, about 5 years ago. They believe she was around 2 when he adopted her so she’s like 7 (give or take) now. She was a rescue from an apartment where they found like 150 cats. ANYWAYS, the last 5 years she has lived with my husband and his old roommate. I’ve been around the last 3 years or so. My husband works a full time 9-5 and his old roommate had always worked weird hours. On the regular, there were at least 4 days a week that the roommate, or my husband was home the majority of the day with her if they didn’t have prior plans. I’ve personally felt that with that not being the case anymore, she probably feels very lonely (I also work a 9-5 so she doesn’t have someone there with her Thursday and Friday like she’s been used to).

In June, we moved my husband’s roommate out and me in. I wanna say she started acting a little goofy around then which makes sense because it was a huge change for her. We noticed around our wedding at the end of August that she wasn’t eating as much. She would usually eat one full cup of hard food a day. My husband switched her food to see if that would help and it did not. Within this time, I feel like she also started throwing up more. She’s always kind of been prone to throwing up because she’s a long hair cat and gets a lot of hair balls. But this was kind of different. It was shortly after my husband mentioned her not eating and I started getting nervous so I gave her a Delectable squeeze pouch that she usually tears up. She took maybe two licks before she turned away and immediately threw up. That’s when I really started to notice that something was off. I believe around this time as well she kind of had a ‘cold’ going on which was another reason why she wasn’t eating as much - seems redundant but will come up again down the line.

The wedding rolled around and she only seemed to be getting worse (mind you from when we noticed to when our wedding was, was maybe within a week or two). The week after the wedding was when I really felt like I started noticing that she was dropping weight. She’s usually a 15+ pound cat. My husband weighed her right around the time of the wedding and she was around 12 pounds. 

Fast forward, we’re about a week and a few days after the wedding and we have to leave for our 10 day honeymoon in Europe. We considered bringing her to my brother’s house so she wouldn’t be as lonely but decided we didn’t want to change her location and make her even more stressed if that’s what the issue was. We had people come to the house to feed her and change her litter box.

About halfway through our trip my brother’s girlfriend sent me a picture of Miss Moon and I felt like she looked so tiny. Come to find out, she had hardly been eating or going to the bathroom while we’d been away but no one wanted to worry us while we were on our honeymoon. However, she was still very sweet and somewhat social the way she usually is. Also might be important to note that before we left we switched her over to a wet food to try and entice her to eat, in which she was mainly only eating the broth out of while we were away. So not a lot of nutrients. When I found this out I got stressed and ordered a high calorie food of sorts that I made my husband’s old roommate go over and give to her. I was getting nervous about fatty liver disease. This was two days before we got home. 

When we got home I was very happy to see that she wasn’t like skin and bone which is what I had convinced myself of. Mind you, still tinier but I don’t know I was convinced we were going to get home and all of her fur was gonna be gone or something. She was very happy to see us but I noticed she had a hard time jumping up on the couch. Later that night while my husband was trying to get all the dried high caloric food out of her fur, he noticed that she poop all in fur. All those times that the sitters thought she wasn’t using the bathroom, she was, but it wasn’t a lot and it was liquid and going all in her fur. It wasn’t even enough to be noticeable and make her stinky, my husband just happened to pick up on it because he was trying to clean her off. So we have to throw her in the utility sink to get her clean. This is a traumatic experience for everyone involved. Poor girl is so scared she’s literally peeing on herself in the sink while we’re just trying to clean her up. The next day we had her eating a little bit but I don’t believe used the litter box. The day following, a Sunday, we were sitting downstairs drinking coffee and we look over and she is peeing on the carpet under the dining room table right in front of us. That’s when we really knew we were running into a problem because she is completely litter box trained. We immediately called to get her into the vet the next day. We also came to the conclusion that maybe she was too weak to get downstairs to her litter box. We’d been home for two days and she usually comes upstairs to our room with us and she didn’t. We thought that maybe she was just mad at us. She needed a new litter box anyways so we brought her food (we also had food upstairs while the sitters were watching her) and new litter box upstairs so she didn’t have to crawl all the way down to the basement and I also wanted to monitor her bowel movements.

Monday, I take her into the vet. Her temperature is normal, no fever. When they weigh her, she weighs in at 9.6 pounds. Her gums are tacky, she’s dehydrated. She’s good throughout the exam, but starts to get vocal when the vet is pressing on her tummy. She doesn’t have lumps or anything strange that the vet points out but seems a little concerned that she didn’t start getting vocal until he was pressing on her stomach. He recommends a blood test and an abdominal scan. He says, ‘I understand not wanting to break the bank, if I had to recommend one over the other, I’d recommend the blood test.’ They do the blood test, give her fluids to rehydrate her, and give her an anti nausea. Send us on our way. The next day, the vet calls me back with the test results. She has an inflamed liver. He says because of her age, and because of a certain level on a T being higher than an N rather than the other way around, he isn’t as concerned about it being a more critical liver issue but couldn’t really say for sure without doing an abdominal scan. From my understanding, he was under the impression that it may have been a virus (which she did have a little something, something going on a few weeks earlier) that didn’t exit the system correctly and went to the liver. He prescribes her 14 Clavamox at 125 mg. Take half a pill every 12 hours. He also prescribed Mirataz to help with appetite. 

So with that being said, she has been on the Clavamox since September 23rd. She’s on day 12 of the 14 prescribed. Since starting, I can’t say she’s gotten significantly better. She’s eaten a bit more and has been using the bathroom on occasion. Her stool is still very runny and it’s dark. I don’t particularly think ‘tarry’ but it’s prettyyyy dark. I call the vet earlier this week and said how we don’t really feel like there’s been much of a change (I had started getting worried because I read that you should start seeing improvement within 2-5 days). He prescribed her Serania to help with nausea and Elura. I opted not go get the Elura because I looked it up and it was saying that it should really only be used for cats with CKD and as far as I know, she doesn’t have that. This might be important to note, but when I brought her in the first time, I wasn’t able to bring a stool sample because she hadn’t really been using the bathroom. I’ve got her set up for another appointment next Wednesday to get her bloodwork redrawn. I’m planning to bring a stool sample up before than to see if that would show any clarity, whether it be a parasite (she’s a 100% indoor cat but I know weird things happen), or confirm it’s an infection, or maybe bacterial growth. 

I guess my question(s), going off of all of that, is the following:

In your experience, what is all of this sounding like? 

What would be your next steps? 

Would it make more sense to knix the recheck of bloodwork since it’s probably going to be pretty much the same and do an abdominal scan so I’m not paying for both? 

I hate to be a penny jerker, but I’m 25 years old with only 3 years of a real job under my belt and just paid for a wedding. All of this is starting to get really expensive and it’s giving ME anxiety too. 

Additionally, is any of this sounding like it could be the cat being overly stressed from all of the changes that are going on? 

She’s a goofy girl, we’ve known that. In my head, I feel like her going potty outside the litter box, being super nauseous, and having irregular bowel moments means there’s something weird going on, but I stood corrected when I looked it up and it said that stress can be a factor in all of this.

And if it is, what can we do to resolve the issue?

I think that’s all I’ve got. Sorry again for the bold, but I wanted to make sure all of the details were included. Hoping I can get some type or reassurance, or answers, or help. ",1,1759554320.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

1nxl5po,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxl5po,A Page In Part 1 Overlooked By Everyone That Makes Part 2 Look INSANE,"Tl:DR Reze will be part of Asa's backstory of what happened to her mom. Whether that was brainwashed by Makima so Reze didn't appear in part 2. Reze could be either Asa's mom or Asa herself. Asa lied about her parents being in a car crash. It is the number one reason people lie about how their parents died. Reze knew Typoon in prior to meeting reze in chapter 52 and in 102 we see typoon older (like he was killed before ch52) and the only person we see interact with Typoon is Asa's mom. Asa and Reze both have similar eyes (they both switch colors designs) and both their devil powers are able to regenerate black arms.  Makima would 100% have erased Reze's mind in chapter 52. The song Reze sings in russian ends with her saying she wouldn't remember.



Part 1 had a huge emphasis on eyes. The original drawlings of Angels are suppose to look more like eyes but modern day they look more like humans. Devils/demons are suppose to be fallen angels....Since the 4 horseman of the apocalypse is from the bible. 

* **In part 1 Page 16 of Chapter 43 -Slide 2+3 - Reze's eye color change Similar to Asa**

Rereading part 2 I was always looking for a theory in why asa's eye change from a completely dark coloring to a grayish/different color. I took a couple days break but also had a theory that the accident devil was the cars that ""killed"" asa's mom according to Asa's story. Today, I stumbled upon someone theorycrafting about the typoon devil being about Asa's dad. Which I don't believe is true. But there was also another theory over a year ago that someone killed the typoon devil. The typoon is shown older with mustache about to kill Asa's mom then the next time we see it its a baby with Reze. I refused to reread the chapters because I don't want to compare to the movie too much. (plan on going to see it on halloween) but I noticed a specific quote from the typoon devil...""I had no idea that you were here, Lady Reze"" the way I intrepret that is some sort of seniority top figure that the Typoon sees Reze. But most importantly about this is that....

**""Reze's Eyecolor changes in this panel...Asa is the only character that does this and  does it all the time""**

That is the only panel that Reze's eye changes. There is only one character who's eyes do that...Asa. Throughout Part 2 her eyes constantly changes. People have been saying that its for traumatic effect and has no meaning but I deflect to that opinon. I read a couple of Fujimoto's work and what he likes to do is intentionally frame panels in a certain way to express emotions. Like goodbye eri he would have Yuta (the mc) holding the camera and it would be fuzzy like the camera is moving. Kind of like Yuta is nervous. He always keeps eye colors consistently in all his works...but not for Asa. Even other characters like Denji when he has emotion of trauma he doesn't have eye color changes. 

Now if we assume Asa's eye color changes for a reason we can reread the story and focus only on the panels where it changes. (don't get mistaken for when Yoru takes over and there are spirals) What I noticed is that her eyes color changes black when she is more human/emotion and its less dark when she looks at devils, Denji, or talks about a specific goal such as killing or making a weapon...Slide 4. A vast majority of those gray colored eyes she looks at the reader. 

**""What if Asa's Eye color changes like how people in other shows change when a trigger word happens""**

I've seen a few shows that had characters change attitude or personalities when certain trigger words or events happen. One that comes to mind is Avatar the last air bender with Jet. When Longfeng tells jet about ""lake Laogai"" his eye color changes just like how I envision Asa's and Reze's eyes do. [https://www.tumblr.com/avatarsymbolism/179407948987/jets-freedom-fighters-avatarsymbolism-i-like](https://www.tumblr.com/avatarsymbolism/179407948987/jets-freedom-fighters-avatarsymbolism-i-like)

When a character has this happen this usually stick to a certain goal and are explicitly focused. In order for this to happen the character needs to have a certain group that trained them to be like this....kishibe mentions this in chapter 52.  

Slide 5 - Kishibe mentions that a certain country trains kids to become powerful. These kids are  in an ammunition storage...so they should be some sort of weapons. What was the country that exposed this? What was the certain countries that is at war currently in the manga?

It is not far fetched that Asa could be one of them. There should be more Reze's. (off topic but Yoshida also mentions he is part of an organization in ch 103) 

""What is also odd is Reze's about Reze's song Jane is suppose to be about Reze + Denji but its also similar to similar events that has happened during part 2.



Chapter 43 Lyrics of Jane song - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezLlkTg3dgo&list=RDezLlkTg3dgo&start\_radio=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezLlkTg3dgo&list=RDezLlkTg3dgo&start_radio=1)

\- First Read this in events with Reze. It makes sense because it is Reze's plan to do with Denji....Now think of events of part 2. Who is there constantly in part 2?

Jane Song:   
1. Everything is ready for my date with Jane.    
2. We are going to church in the morning. -   
3. We will have coffee and omelettes in the cafe.  
4. After we've taken a stroll in the park,  
5. We'll go to the aquarium to see dolphins and penguins Jane loves so much.  
6. We'll rest in the afternoon.  
7. So what did we do in the morning?  
8. We'll reminisce and remember (word-by-word ""we'll talk until we remember"")  
9. We will not remember (""until we remember"").  
10. We spent the night in the church (""and at night we'll sleep in the church""). 

A lot of the lines happened in part 2 with Asa. But what people overlook is that in line 9 it says everything about Reze. Reze hasn't appeared because she does not remember because Makima erased her mind. 

  
Jane is another word for a gift from god. God backwards is dog...pochita is suppose to be the lamb of god in the story of the 4 horseman. God's gift to the world is life...which is why pochita is orange and his shape...he is a embryo/ 

  
**""Now that we addressed the similarities of the eyecolor changes of Asa and Reze we can finally talk about Slide 1. Reze knows what happens to Asa's mom Chapter 102""**

In chapter 98 Reze is walking in class and other kids are talking about how her parents died in a car accident. Then in 216 it shows the accident devil. The accident devil, slide 7, are the same cars in slide 6 from chapter 102. 3 slides later there is an older lady. Her face looks like the face of the accident devil fused with the two cars. 

Also in chapter 102 we see a slide saying ""MOM!!!"" without showing what happened to the mom. Chapter 182 Asa says her mom was ate by a devil, which was the typoon devil. So we are assuming that her mom died from being eaten... what if she killed the typoon devil instead?  That is possible.

If Asa's mom kills typoon devil and somehow is related to Reze. That would make sense why she calls her Lady Reze. We also don't know what Asa's mom name is. 

**""I believe Asa, Reze, and Yoru all have their memories alter.""**

The control devil and Pochita have the ability to alter memories. Makima could've erased Reze's memories. Pochita could've altered the war devils memories when they ate ""part"" of her. 

Slide 1 Reze kind of looks like Asa's mom if she puts her hair up a bit in a bun. The only difference is the eyes. My theory is Reze is either Asa's mom or Asa is fused with her mom or Reze is a relative to Asa.

Also when Yoru regrows her arms is just like how Reze regrew her arms into weapons. Both black arms. 

There are too many similarities that Reze and Asa are blood related. They wouldn't know each other if their memories were altered. But there is also a small chance they are the same person. Possibly fused or memories wiped out. It wouldn't make sense Reze to leave at the climax of what her mission was intended to do. ",11,1759554150.0,Chainsawfolk,16,0.82,False

1nxl3ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1nxl3ym/i_quit_after_one_shift_for_the_first_time_ever/,I Quit After One Shift for the First Time Ever,"I just quit a restaurant after my first shift for the first time ever.

This was a new coffee shop / diner that opened 2 weeks ago. I don't have experience making coffee drinks, but I have bartending and serving experience (and they really needed people and offered me a more stable schedule) so I said sure. I noticed some red flags, like low google reviews, but I figured I'd give it a shot and keep job hunting.

I'd agreed with the owner that she'd be there to train me for my first three shifts because I don't have experience making the kind of fancy lattes she had on the menu. I come in for my first day, and she isn't there. It's only her mother working the kitchen and one customer. The customer tells the mother that the coffee she’d made her was cold and asks for her to reheat it. Her mother only says no, and when the customer asks why she then says it’s for food safety reasons. I overheard this, and offered to make her a new one, but her mother simply said that wouldn’t be necessary and told me to just go behind the register. 

People immediately start to come in and I ask her what sides there are (Toast only says ""salad"" under sides and they're not listed on the menu) and she says they're in the cooler to my right. I see 10ish small containers of coleslaw, bean salad, and a side salad so I start asking people which of those sides they'd prefer and ringing in orders, while I write down the orders because there's several drink buttons missing as well.

I'm trying to flip through the drink recipe book and make these drinks as fast as I can, not knowing where anything is or how to make them beforehand while the mother’s consistently yelling at me to move faster. Keep in mind I'm the only one taking orders, putting them together, running food, and bussing tables. Then, I let her know that there's only a few of each side left so I'll need more prepped and she says what's out there is all there is. At this point, it's only noon and there's still a line of people waiting to be rung in.

Then, the owner finally walks in carrying an 18 month old toddler. She puts the kid down, says that she usually brings him because she can't always find childcare, and then lets him run RAMPANT behind the counter. Her mother had slid a folding table up against the kitchen door, trying to block him out (unsuccessfully) and blocking us out as well. This kid then starts taking silverware out of its rolls, opens cabinets and starts throwing things in there on the floor, is slapping my butt as he runs (I later heard the owner remind him not to bite), putting things in his mouth, and takes my stuff out of my folder with my social and payroll documents I’d brought and leaves them all over the floor. During this, I’m trying to ask the owner questions and have her train me but she’s not able to get more than a sentence or two in before she’s trying to clean after her kid. And people are coming up saying their silverware was missing different utensils BECAUSE of this kid. 

But she thankfully is able to tell me that there’s a pulled pork soup, a tomato soup, and a vegan chili when I say that we’re running out of sides. So I write those down, keep writing down orders as I ring them in, and start making the ordered drinks. While I’m making the drinks, I ask her how to ring in the soups or if there’s something I have to do with them and she says I was supposed to write down the soup in the instructions and I have to let her mother know right away. I’m trying to get three drinks out so I ask her to go tell her mother but I guess she was busy with her toddler because next thing I know her mother is yelling through the window that I need to get back there right now. I go to the kitchen and she starts yelling at me saying that I can’t just not ring food in, I need to be faster and do what I’m told, and that I have to make the soups now because I messed them up.

I bite my tongue, go “okay”, and start asking where the bowls and soups are. She’s very short and p\*ssed every time I’m asking where things are or how long to microwave them for. One was just sitting out on the counter uncovered, one was in an old mayo jar unlabelled, and another one was in another unmarked container in the fridge. I poured them into the bowls, set them to heat for 5 minutes, let her know, and left. 

Back at the counter, the owner’s trying to make drinks while her son still runs around so I start taking orders. Then, when the soups are ready, her mom puts them in the window and says “They would’ve been ready faster if you hadn’t messed this up!” I finally went, “Respectfully, I didn’t even know these soups existed until 30 minutes ago.” She snaps back, wagging her finger at me, and yells “Knock it off! You’d already been here for an hour and a half before then.”

Multiple orders go out, with the owner just straight up asking the customers what sides and orders they had rather than looking at my notepad I’d shown her or waiting for me to check it and her mom yelling that I’d sold more soup than they had (I’d sold no more than 2 of each). There’s multiple orders missing sides and a few drinks the owner made get sent back - which she loudly complains about behind the counter within earshot. She also doesn’t let me make a fresh pot of coffee, saying she doesn’t want it to go to waste even if there’s just half a pot left and she’s charging $6 for a cup of Folger’s. And then says she can’t afford to give people 2 lids so the premade cold sides need to remain lidded when served.

Finally, 2pm rolls around and I’m SO beyond ready to leave. I had been told I could take my cash tips home but my credit card tips would be added onto my paycheck. So I start emptying the jar when the owner’s mother says “You’re splitting that. You and (insert owner’s name) both worked the floor so you’re splitting your tips.” I knew that was SUPER illegal, but I also knew these were unreasonable people who would definitely fight me on that. So I took pictures of my Toast shift summary with my owed tips, made sure they weren’t looking at how much cash had been in the jar, and just left a couple dollars out with a few coins for my sanity. Most cash had been left on the tables anyway, so the owner hadn’t known about it because she hadn’t been bussing. 

I sent a whole message once I quit telling her how unsafe it was for everyone involved for her kid to be running around there, how her mother was driving away customers and employees, how I was not trained and didn’t appreciate being treated that way, and how it was illegal for an owner to claim tips and I’d be expecting my tips with my paycheck. I ended it by telling her that if she keeps going the way she is, she’ll be closed in a month tops and if she wants a shot at staying open she’s going to have to put the work in. 

I’m honestly kinda shocked that was as bad as it was, or that they’ve gotten this far. They were previously open for a few months in a neighboring town and moved here, and I was able to (unsurprisingly) find a report of them cross contaminating food there. I think that they’ve been watching too much Gilmore Girls, thought this would be a “cute, fun job”, have NEVER worked in a kitchen, and got funding somehow. But oh my god, what a sh\*tshow.

You might wonder, how many spoons of coffee do you really need?**

Too little, and your coffee tastes weak. Too much, and it turns bitter. Getting this just right can change your whole morning. You’ll discover the simple, foolproof way to measure coffee for 10 cups. By the end, you’ll never guess wrong again—and every cup will be just how you like it.

Keep reading to unlock the secret to great coffee every time.

# Choosing The Right Coffee Scoop

Choosing the right coffee scoop helps make perfect coffee every time. It ensures you use the correct amount of coffee grounds for your brew. Using too much or too little coffee can change the taste. A good scoop gives consistency and balance to your cup.

Many coffee lovers do not know that scoops come in different sizes. Picking the right scoop can save time and avoid guesswork. This guide explains scoop sizes and measuring techniques for 10 cups.

# Standard Scoop Sizes

Most coffee scoops hold about one tablespoon of coffee. One tablespoon equals roughly 5 to 7 grams of coffee grounds. Some scoops are larger and hold two tablespoons. The scoop size affects how many scoops you need for 10 cups.

For 10 cups, you usually need 10 to 12 tablespoons of coffee. Using a standard one-tablespoon scoop means 10 to 12 scoops. If your scoop is larger, count fewer scoops. Check the scoop size before measuring your coffee.

# Measuring Techniques

Leveling off the coffee in the scoop helps with accuracy. Fill the scoop and use a flat edge to remove extra grounds. Avoid packing coffee tightly in the scoop. Lightly filled scoops give better results.

Use a scale for the best measurement if possible. Weighing coffee ensures the exact amount for 10 cups. Without a scale, use the same scoop consistently. Keep your scoop clean to avoid clumping and errors.

# Calculating Coffee For 10 Cups

Calculating the right amount of coffee for 10 cups helps make great-tasting coffee every time. The right balance between coffee and water is key. Too little coffee makes a weak brew. Too much coffee can be bitter and strong. Measuring coffee carefully saves money and avoids waste. Follow simple steps to get the perfect cup size and taste.

Understanding the coffee-to-water ratio and adjusting for taste makes brewing easy. Start with a basic ratio and change it based on your preference. This way, you can enjoy coffee that suits your liking every morning.

# Coffee-to-water Ratio

The standard ratio is about 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water. For 10 cups, which equals 60 ounces, use 10 to 20 tablespoons of coffee. Most people find 15 tablespoons a good middle ground. Using a kitchen scale helps for more accuracy. One tablespoon of coffee weighs about 5 grams. So, 75 grams of coffee works well for 10 cups.

# Adjusting For Strength Preferences

Some like their coffee mild, others strong. To make mild coffee, use fewer tablespoons, around 10 to 12 for 10 cups. For stronger coffee, increase to 18 to 20 tablespoons. Remember, small changes affect the flavor a lot. Adjust slowly and taste test each time. This way, you find the perfect coffee strength for you and your guests.

# Types Of Coffee And Their Impact

Coffee types affect how much you need for 10 cups. Each type has a different strength and grind size. This changes the amount of coffee per cup. Knowing the type helps make the perfect brew.

# Ground Coffee Variations

Ground coffee comes in different types like fine, medium, and coarse. Fine grounds are strong and need less coffee per cup. Coarse grounds are weaker and need more. For 10 cups, use about 10 to 12 tablespoons of medium ground coffee. Adjust based on your taste and grind size.

# Instant Coffee Measurements

Instant coffee is quick and easy to use. It is more concentrated than ground coffee. Use about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of instant coffee per cup. For 10 cups, that means 10 to 15 teaspoons. Stir well to get the best flavor. Instant coffee needs less spoonfuls than ground coffee.

My wife is going out for a trip to visit her family for 1-2 weeks (depends on how well it goes with travel & such) in November. She's taking all 3 children, and I'm staying home because I already took my vacation time in August. 

What to do, what to do...?

I'm looking for some ideas on how to fill the time, especially since they might be gone for two whole weeks. 

I will absolutely be painting/illustrating, writing, going for runs & walks, hosting a movie night, hosting a games night, and inviting a number of people over. 

My current thought is that I may feel stuck as we're a one vehicle family on the outside perimeter of our town, thankfully I live very close to my work & can walk or bike.

A sweet elderly lady, probably in her 80s, came in shaking badly and walking slowly with a cane. She was clearly struggling, and my heart sank seeing her like that. I walked over and asked if I could help with anything. She smiled and said, “Do you mind filling up my cup with ice, dear?” Of course, I said yes and filled it up for her.
While I was helping, she started chatting with me and apologized for bothering me, explaining that a new medication was making her shaky and affecting her mobility. I told her not to apologize I was there to help.Then she said something that broke my heart “Dear, I hate to be a bother again, but do you have anything old or expired I can get for a discount? I don’t have much money.” That’s when I just knew she needed more help than she was asking for. I told her, “Ma’am, whatever you need today, I’ll pay for it. Doesn’t matter the price.”

She looked at me in shock.

“Are you sure? You don’t have to.”
“I’m positive. Would you like a drink or maybe some food?”She nodded slowly, clearly emotional.“C-can I get a coffee and maybe a c-cheeseburger? If that’s not too much for you."" I smiled and said of course. I bought her a Starbucks coffee and a cheeseburger. When I handed it to her, she started crying and hugged me, saying thank you over and over. I hugged her back and told her she’s going to get through this that it’s going to be okay.
I walked her to her car, and she told me she was going through her second round of cancer. She’d spent nearly everything she had left on chemo and doctor visits. She said what I did was the kindest thing anyone had done for her in a long time, and that she didn’t have much family or support left.Before driving away, she said
“Sweetie, you made this day amazing. Thank you. I’ll keep you in my prayers tonight.""

After she left, I went into the backroom and cried. For her. For everything she’s going through. 
I don’t share this to be recognized or praised. I share it as a reminder: always be kind. You never know what someone is going through and sometimes, the smallest gesture can mean the world. ",4,1759553703.0,CustomerService,1,0.84,False

In your introductory statement?), you’ve opened the door and might be asked in follow-up questions which then would not be illegal.*

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I am 30 and married someone who is 46. I used to work in the same company and he was the Managing director. We met face to face only once, while both waiting for our coffee at the company's coffee shop. He didn't know who I am, but I did. We all knew him. Especially for his temper and strong personality. He would get very frustrated under pressure and very tough with underperforming departments. I was with a coworker and we both said hello, but he didn't answer. He had a very tensioned relationship with my boss. She wasn't good at her job, missed deadline and lied a lot. So when he and her ended up in the same meeting (I participated in just one meet with both of them there) everyone else was quiet because they kept arguing. I was a bit jealous she could step up to him.

I left the company and we met again randomly. He had been divorced for one year at the time. He had no idea who I was, only when I told him the department, he asked: ah you were under (my boss name). I was a bit starstruck tbh. He was older, held power, was confident and could offer me something I lacked my whole life: a mascuIline figure just the way I dreamed about. He could lead, he could take decisions under pressure. I felt proud of him. My dad was not like that. I was ashamed of him. Jobless all the time, relied on my mother, his parents, always needed someone to take care of him and had a drinking problem. When I was a kid I was so ashamed and would lie to other kids that he does have a job but cannot say what it is.

So, within a year we got married. I am 30 now, have two children, a toddler son and a baby daughter and my husbands want more. My issue is that he has the same temper at home too as he has at job. While things are going smoothly, he is nice, fun, but as soon as they don't, he is irritated, frustrated, raises his voice. He climbed the corporate ladder and he is now the General Manager, so he couldn't even go higher than this. But spends even more time either at the office or at the production plants. He has his assistant but he doesn't fully trust her because he has to see with his own eyes that everything is going as it should.

He comes home, eats, showers and sleeps. We are intimate maybe 3 times a month if he is in the mood. But usually too tired for anything. When he is in a good mood he pulls me into his lap after I put our son to bed and then we spend 15-20 minutes talking and I rest my head on his shoulder or something. I love him but I am tired. I will also return to work in a few months. I work again at the same company as him, but at a low level position. So he didn't pull any strings for me. He said its better to work at the same place as I don't have a driving license and we can go and return home together. We go together, but usually a coworker drives me home because my husband returns at 7, 8 pm. Also, the coworkers I used to have a good relationship with, some years ago, now avoid me somehow",0,1759553424.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,0.5,False
1nxkxet,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxkxet,Amy’s Diary – Coffee Day Weekend Reunion,"This weekend was supposed to be just a quiet break, but of course, with my friends, it turned into another adventure. After lunch, we all agreed to meet at Coffee Day again—me, Carmen, Kira, Winfrey, Siu Ling, and Monique.

The moment we pushed open the door, the warm smell of roasted beans hit my nose, and my belly gave a little rumble. But what made us stop and stare wasn’t the smell—it was the staff lineup.

There was Zoe, of course, in her signature black lace outfit, smiling like always. But this time, the entire staff was dressed the same way as her! Anastasia the Russian barista, Ayaka the cashier, Li Mei the Chinese waitress, Charlotte the British barista, Madison the American waitress, Minji the pastry chef, and even little Haruka, Ayaka’s niece, helping her aunt behind the counter—all in matching black outfits with the Coffee Day logo shining bold across them.

Carmen gasped so loudly I thought she was choking. “It’s like… a fashion army of Coffee Day butts!”

I nearly doubled over holding my belly. Kira covered her face, muttering, “I… I can’t look straight at them without blushing!”

But then another surprise came: Mr. Tanaka himself was there, standing at the side with a tray of coffee beans. He wasn’t in the same uniform, of course—just a neat suit—but he smiled kindly at us.

He introduced himself politely, “I am Ayaka’s brother. I help as a businessman and assistant here at Coffee Day. My job is to handle supplies, manage the deals, and make sure my sister and daughter are taken care of.”

Winfrey, being the novel-lover, whispered to me, “He looks like he stepped straight out of a family café drama.”

Monique added with a grin, “And surrounded by all these ladies in those outfits, I don’t know if I should call him lucky or cursed.”

We laughed, but honestly, I admired him. He worked hard while keeping such a calm smile. Zoe even patted him on the shoulder proudly, like he was part of her team too.

As we sat down with our drinks, Carmen whispered, “This place… it’s not just a café anymore. It’s like… Coffee Day is building a whole world.”

I sipped my latte, my belly pressing against the table edge as I leaned forward. “If they release Coffee Day uniforms for customers, I swear, I’ll faint right here.”

Everyone burst out laughing, and even Zoe, overhearing us, gave a little wink that made my cheeks heat up.",1,1759553389.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I was on a tea kick for awhile which I know is better/low calorie but I got so sick of tea... ugh. Might need to just try some different flavours and cut out the one calorie dense hot drink I drink each day.

A lot of the things I cook are quite calorie dense because my mom is sick and needs to consume a lotttt of calories to try and put on weight - I however do not need to put on any more weight lol. and I just don't have the energy to cook two different meals for breakfast and dinner so I just eat smaller portions... which leaves me snack-ish.  
Also rn don't have the time to do a ton of exercise(Definitely planning on starting to do some light exercise eventually! things are finally calming down and I think I'll be able to soon) so I've just been trying to stay under a certain amount of calories each day, but it's tough. I like to snack. I mighttt just have to suck it up and start cooking different meals for myself but for right now, focusing on the snack issue.

Salty or sweet are both good. I've never been a huge fan of eating a lot of candy though. I'm just looking for some low calorie snack ideas.

1nxkpfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1nxkpfz/a_lot_of_you_are_confused_by_gold_and_silver_moves/,A lot of you are confused by Gold and Silver moves.,"I'll keep this brief unlike a lot of AI *tatti* smeared across Indian Reddit these days.

It all starts with the humble business owner. He takes something useless like Iron ore or a college graduate and creates something of value like a steel sheet or a software product. Now, in this globalized world the juiciest margins to be had are often not in your home country. So he exports that product or service in exchange of that foreign currency. 

Now normally this is balanced by the imports of the home country. But as we know, some countries are just net exporters, year after year, decade after decade. That creates a tension! These exporters want to accumulate all these earnings in to something that holds value across decades, something that can finance the inevitable coke addiction of their grandkids. Yet that something has to be liquid enough, divisible enough that it doesn't cause problems during inheritance (like real estate and art collections).

Cut the long story short, they are left with bonds, equity and Gold. Equity, as we know, is pretty volatile. An **average** stock moves 50% up and 50% down from its starting value every year. So bonds and Gold are in direct competition. 

US being the big daddy of the world after WW2 also became the issuer of **THE** reserve asset of the world: US treasuries. You lend money to big daddy, daddy gives you an yield, you feel like your money is making money. Moreover, US treasuries are also basically the only valid reserves for a bank operating internationally. 

So, exporters earn their money, mostly in dollars, they put it in a saving account with US government, and the whole world hums along. But big daddy sees the big pile of money accumulating from all the exporters and gets greedy. He starts funding social programs, retirement funds, anything to win votes. He's always assured that more money will flow into treasuries next year since the world economy can only go up! So exporters end up funding the American Dream^TM . They feed the *hyperscalers* in Silicon Valley and the financial service boom on the East coast.

But there's a Gold size problem in this scheme. What if the exporter immediately puts all his earning into this scarce, shiny yellow rock? Big daddy can't conjure up the yellow rock from thin air? Brilliant! Finally exports get to eat their cake! Not so fast. Don't forget, much like any other commodity on Earth, Gold is traded in Western institutions: LBMA in London and COMEX in New York. At the behest of big daddy, they yank down the price of Gold **AND** Silver (refer the Hunt brothers episode), the moment it starts discovering a fair price.


But then comes China in the bull shop. 1 trillion dollars in exports every year. **UNPRECEDENTED**. They understand the game and they're not bowing to big daddy. They have the temerity to open up Shanghai Gold exchange. They will export the yummy yummies, they get the greeenbacks, put it straight into Gold, which they price with Yuan at their own exchange. Since Yuan price with USD is heavily controlled, Gold becomes the de facto reserve asset (and **not** Yuan, very important to understand!). The fun part: Gold appreciates in Yuan (in Shanghai), but Yuan is kept steady with dollar, so Gold rises in dollars and the Western institutions can no longer suppress Gold and Silver prices!

Even more fun part, Shanghai Gold exchange is opening up branches in Middle East, the other large exporting block of the world. London and New York are losing their pricing powers. You are watching this in real time. It is happening as quickly as it can. All of it was theory 2 years ago, now its reality.

I guess I couldn't keep it short. I blame it on the coffee.

TL;DR = Gold now priced by exporters (China and Middle East), not by twin deficit nations (US and UK).",33,1759552632.0,IndianStockMarket,7,0.9,False

We had feedback meeting today at my request when I filed for accommodations and he wrote me up today. There will be a written warning that goes into my employment file which I should see next week.

He says while he has seen improvement in less phone use, cleaner workspace, and better checking emails, and even less talking, the talking is still an issue.

I’m ordered to stay at my desk at all times, not allowed to have any conversations except at the breakroom, can’t talk to anyone while getting coffee or when passing them in the hallway, walkway, etc, only allowed to have work conversations and if the other colleagues talk about not work I have to hard stop them after 2-3 minutes and go back to work. He says I will not grow as a professional if I can’t adhere to this feedback.

Other colleagues talk all the time in the office together so maybe he just doesn’t like me or I’m his next target. He is an insane micromanager not just to me but other colleagues too though me more than them.

He joined 11 months ago. Before he started grilling on me, one girl who reported to him told me she was very unhappy with him and they butted heads all the time. He never appreciated her or advocated for promotion and he nitpicked everything she did which led her to resign. She was with the company for 7 years and the day he joined he was always on her. Another guy resigned a week before her who also reported to him.

At my last company, my boss actively encouraged some not work chit chat cause it helped you bond with other colleagues and they would like working with you.

Other colleagues always tell me I’m doing great, that I’m super fast, and thank you for your help all the time whenever they need my assistance with something. It just feels like it doesn’t line up.

Yes I will agree that I did a few things wrong but I think the complete cut out will make enjoying the work really hard for me. I might have to start looking for a new job even though the market is brutal and it makes me look like a job hopper cause I got let go for budget cuts before at the last job. I’m really starting to think he wants me to quit as he has said “this may be not the right job for you”.

Failure to improve in the area he stated is a further concern, he threatened may result in further action, up to and including termination of employment, with three write ups being automatic termination. This is my first.

I feel sad because other colleagues still talk all the time together and I’m not allowed to and that I’m being a bit singled out cause I don’t fit in with others as well. Should I just resign with zero notice and walk out? I have most of my things already packed and ready to leave as soon as I can find a new job or might have to leave before.",4,1759552167.0,autism,9,1.0,False

The result is my debut novel, SOLMORK!

It's about Zilar, a girl who doesn't fit in with the kind, angelic Edel or the chaotic, destructive Boshaft. She yearns to find a place to call home, but once she witnesses how cruel fate can be, she yells, ""*To hell with this yearning for belonging! If it demands that I become a monster to be among them, then let the yearning be cast into the abyss!*""

This book is my heart. I cried writing it. I laughed (mostly at my own dialogue and how absurd I am). I poured every ounce of my own longing and hope into Zilar's story.

I'm equally proud and terrified to finally share SOLMORK with people who aren't my friends. If you're looking for a fantasy with a lonely, powerful heroine, a found family, and a world on the brink of collapse, I'd be so honored if you gave it a chance.

I am so broke, I can’t even afford a cup of coffee but I can’t work normal jobs because of availability issues. As a pa and through this film program I’m in, I have to be available as much as possible especially monday-friday. This has been my dream since I was 6 and somehow I got lucky and achieved more than I thought was possible for someone like me and I realize that it’s the only thing that will ever truly make me happy and fuel me basically. I was never good at the 12 schools I went to and had a hard time fitting in and when I was on set that was the first time I felt like I belonged somewhere and I’m not ready to give that up because of financial stress especially at age 23. But, I pay about $2000 in bills every month from doordash, instacart, catering etc and it’s not enough and those jobs are becoming more unsustainable with the way prices have gone up on everything. So now, I’m stuck trying to figure out if i just get a job and quit every time there’s a pa gig which could be months in between work. Or keep going the way I am but add in more random gigs and never know what I’m doing the next week and just hope I have enough at the end of the month. I literally do not know what to do, I’m at a breaking point and it’s affecting my partner as well especially because we wanna move out of our crappy apartment into a house with our friends to make our monthly rent go down and we can’t start saving until I figure it out. If anyone has any advice or if someone could tell me if I’m making things harder on myself or not that would be appreciated. I love film more than anything and will do anything to stay on this path but it’s just not sustainable enough and I’m very lost :/
