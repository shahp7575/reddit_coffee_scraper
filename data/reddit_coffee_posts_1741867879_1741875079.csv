1jacrbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1jacrbp/will_i_eventually_stop_losing_weight/,Will I eventually stop losing weight,"I'm on this diet for health not weight loss.


Been keto since September,  canri most the time for about 3 months. 

Weight is falling off I'm becoming skinny.

I hike daily lift weights a few times a week.

I'm eating mainly pork, and, beef, sometimes chicken thighs skin on, lots of eggs.
All fatty cuts of meat , pork rindes.

Everything cooked in animal fat. Adding butter after cooking.

Heavy cream added to my food and coffee

I eat cream cheese , cottage , and chedder.

I see many people here eat once a day. I'm still on 3 BIG meals.

I'm shrinking out of my clothes down to 29 inch jeans.

I don't want to lose anymore weight.

Is it possible I need some carbs? I know it's not carnivore but is it possible carnivore is not for me if I don't stop losing weight. 

The amount of food I need is costing a fortune.

1jac1qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1jac1qv/one_of_my_best_friends_just_broke_up_with_their/,One of my best friends just broke up with their entitled girlfriend because I had an argument with her about a woman who stole a bag of cans out of my truck,"A few days ago I posted in AITA, and realized something. I may have started doxxing myself by speaking of the bottle deposit in my state. I may as well come out and say it since I probably shouldn't be posting here anymore anyway. But I'm not in the part of the US I was previously telling people. I only said it was that part because I didn't want to risk people trying to figure out where I live and who I am. It's pretty much the only thing I fibbed about. But in retrospect, it's probably redundant now that I'm no longer posting about Dan, or my Ex-SIL, or my parents. Dan and my niblings are doing great BTW, and yes, Dan is still living in his own camper out of our parents' backyard since he gave his room to his son. He still wants to buy his own truck to go camping with it sometime. But supporting his family comes first before a fun vehicle, and he's still in financial recovery after what his ex-wife put him through pissing away his savings and wracking up debt. And on top of that, Dan has saving for his kids' future colleges to worry about. So a truck is not on the priority list.

My parents are doing good. My mother is more emotionally stable around me now. She went through a bad phase of getting stressed at the drop of a feather and apologizing to everyone constantly. Even seeing any sort of story remotely similar to the ones I posted would send her back to therapy. But she's finally making great progress. My father isn't exactly cheerful around me. We're amicable with each other. Even drank together a few times. But we lost out on truly bonding as father and son due to the past favoritism for Dan. But he's been working his ass off to better himself, and I appreciate his hard work. My parents can't change the past. So they're just working hard to move forward.

As for my Ex-SIL, she's basically stopped bothering to see her three kids she had with Dan at all, and has even been talking about completely giving up her parental rights to them over and over again, but never seems to go through with it despite never being around. She got one hell of a cheese-slap in life a year ago when she got a DUI, and had to take classes and remain sober for six months. Which drove her absolutely nuts. We all expected her to cave and start drinking again when she wasn't supposed to. But she held to it. I guess she was afraid of what would happen if she broke the court order. She got her license back, but currently has to drive with a breathalyzer in her car. She can't have an ounce of alcohol in her, or the car won't drive. She was trying to flirt with Dan off and on for a while, but he never took the bait. So she moved on to dating someone else now, who I bet she's making do everything for her. I guess in a way that's good news for us. But I pity whatever guy she roped in. None of us put baby-trapping past her. We're all glad she's out of our lives. But my niblings still lost their mother because she's an entitled, shopaholic, narcissistic cheater who got karma cheese-slapped. Saying she was cheese-slapped has become a running gag when talking about her since I first coined that line. My parents, Dan, and several of my friends keep saying ""Oh-no! They got cheese-slapped!"" as a joke when karma hits people they know or know of. Not sure if she knows about it or not. But we don't care. I'm pretty sure she was the one who egged my truck on Halloween a year and a half ago. But it's not happened since.

Anyway, last week I had a huge bag full of cans I was going to go cash in. And some woman stole them out of the back of my truck while I was having lunch. The bottle drop wasn't far, so I headed that way and caught her lugging my bag of cans. I pulled over and confronted her. She denied the theft until I threatened to call police, and mentioned the place I ate lunch likely caught her on CCTV. She griped about money being tight, and I didn't care. She dropped the bag and cussed me out before I could call the cops. I told this story to some friends later, and only one person was upset with me. And it was the now ex-girlfriend of one of my best friends. I was really worried this incident ruined a relationship. But it turns out the breakup was a long time coming. When I argued with this woman, she yelled at me that the woman who stole the bag of cans out of the back of my truck was possibly homeless, and I went too far chasing her down and making her return the cans. She called me an asshole who can't give people a break because I was so wronged in the past. And then she sarcastically mocked me by putting on her boyfriend's baseball cap and acting like me in the worst parody way she could do. But nobody was laughing. Especially not her now ex-boyfriend. He yanked the hat off her head and told her that went too far. And she yelled that my taking some cans back from a possibly broke or homeless woman was too far, and stormed out of the bar. I ended up feeling conflicted after a few more drinks at home, and didn't sleep well because the stress made my insomnia act up again. So I posted on Reddit to ask if I was in the wrong, and got a pretty much 90% NTA. I couldn't go into full detail in that subreddit because of character limit though.

Well, because my friends know about this reddit account, it wasn't long at all before I was getting phone calls and text messages. So I logged out and stopped answering comments. Shit was hitting the fan fast. My friend and his now ex-girlfriend had a massive argument over the phone during their lunch breaks. And they officially broke up that evening at his place. The ex-girlfriend also messaged me to call me an ass one more time, and told me I'd ruined everything. I didn't respond, and just blocked the number. I never gave her my number before either. Jury is still out on how she got it. But it wouldn't have been hard. She could have copied it from my friend's phone, or asked someone else who knows. I was really upset and stressed that I was the cause of the breakup. But then my friend came over with some beer and told me that he'd only been dating that woman for five or six moths. And she was constantly nagging him, trying to milk him for money to buy her things, always took alcohol from his fridge to take back to her place without asking, wanted him to pay for every meal when they ate out since the first date, and was constantly on her phone to the point of it being extremely annoying. Even on date nights she was always on her phone. That's pretty much how their Valentines Day went. He knew then he wanted to end things soon, because he felt like he was dating an entitled teenager.

He also mentioned she was being really rough with him as of late. He wouldn't elaborate on what he meant by rough. So I let it go. Either way he used the situation to finally end the relationship. He said she screamed and cried, cussed him out, and gaslit by denying all the points he made about her. But he had none of it, and told her they were through. She packed any stuff she had in his apartment and left. He said she also tried to take some stuff that wasn't hers too. Like his MJ stash, and the coffee maker. He loves coffee, and has one of those coffee makers that dispenses the coffee from those little plastic cups. She apparently argued that he got her hooked on good coffee. And he could just get another machine. That's when he started filming her and told her to get out before he involved police. He says he's not sure she wanted the coffee maker just for good coffee, or if she just wanted the machine to spite him. Personally I make my coffee with a plain-jane coffee pot because the other people living in my house share in the morning coffee too. Before that I just drank instant.

Back to my place, I still have a couple of guys renting rooms from me to ease the cost of my mortgage, and you could say those guys are real bros. They came out to join us in drinking beer. The four of us got drunk playing UNO and he who smelt it, dealt it. And then I finally got some deep sleep. Albeit on my couch after too much beer. And only for about seven hours. My phone's alarm may as well have been nails on a chalkboard to my ears when it went off in the morning. My friend left my phone right near my head after I passed out. That wasn't the only thing he left. I woke up with a square of sandwich cheese on my face. God damnit! He cheese-slapped me! I laughed and immediately felt the sting of my hangover. I was too drunk to feel it when he threw it on my face after I passed out. So he just left it there before he went to bed in my room for the night so he wouldn't need to go home. Either way, we both had a painful hangover laugh about it. The both of us had to call in and come to work late to ease our morning hangovers. And I was basically running on energy drinks all day. My friend's ex has not made any more attempts to contact me or him so far. She's blocked a whole bunch of people on her social media, and is essentially out of the whole friend group now. Turns out a lot of people didn't like her anyway. So no one else is losing sleep over it.

I REALLY shouldn't be posting here again. But just to clarify a couple of details. The bag I was using to haul the cans was a large transparent bag made to cover mattresses. You can use them as giant garbage bags once they've been taken off the mattress. And a friend of mine works warehousing and delivering mattresses. And he gives the used mattress bags out for free to friends and family. They can hold a lot, and don't leak or tear as much as regular garbage bags if in good shape. I also only buy cans and plastic bottles for beverages because they're much lighter than glass when bagged up. Second thing I want to clarify. I did get my friend's permission to make this post since the situation heavily involved him. He's pretty chill about it, and jokingly said I could owe him a six pack of talls for the whole mess. And even though he said it as a joke, yesterday I left the six pack at his front door with a pink bow on it, before ringing the doorbell and bolting. He thought that was pretty funny. Personally, I'm gonna lay off the booze for a little while anyway.

So yeah, I hope I don't get tempted to ever come back here to post anything again.",17,1741872771.0,EntitledPeople,5,0.81,False

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1jabw8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkLifeInKorea/comments/1jabw8s/the_most_surprising_things_about_korean_work/,The Most Surprising Things About Korean Work Culture,"When I started working in Korea, I thought I'd done enough homework—watched videos, read articles, talked to people—but still, Korean work culture managed to surprise me in delightful and unexpected ways.

First, I was amazed by the sense of community at the workplace. Back home, lunchtime meant quickly grabbing something to eat alone, often in front of my screen. But here, everyone gathers together, shares food, laughs, and genuinely connects. Eating became my favorite part of the day because it allowed me to bond with coworkers in ways I didn't anticipate.

Another pleasant surprise was the level of teamwork. In Korea, people naturally jump in to help each other, even without being asked. Once, I was struggling with heavy boxes, and within seconds colleagues were there assisting me, no questions asked. That small moment made me realize how genuinely people cared about each other's well-being at work.

Something else that caught me off guard was how important small gestures are here. Saying hello, bowing slightly, or offering a cup of coffee—these small acts of kindness built trust and warmth in my daily interactions. Initially, I worried about doing everything correctly, but quickly learned sincerity mattered much more than perfection.

Most importantly, Korea taught me the value of humility and respect in the workplace. The idea of respecting seniority and showing appreciation seemed formal at first, but soon I understood it created a supportive environment where everyone felt valued.

For those of you coming to Korea or considering working here, keep your heart open. Korean work culture might initially seem different, but it's filled with kindness, teamwork, and opportunities for personal growth. Embrace these surprises—they'll enrich your experience more than you could ever imagine. You've got this!

I'm in phase 2 (2nd week).
3x5,1x5 #s
Sq-355, BP- 252.5, DL- 415, Press-182.5

Nutrition 3000-3500 calories estimate. 200g protein.

Recently backed off to phase 2 on deadlifts. They were still progressing 5lbs, but I was feeling like it was starting to get into the next training day feeling a bit sluggish, not to mention feeling like crap the day of and after workouts.

Making this change is helping the day of next workout, but the day of training (directly after training and lasting the rest of the  day) I feel like absolute run down shit.

I want to mention and I'll admit that I kind of go by feel with calories, so 3000-3500 is an estimate
Some days may be a little less, but not usually more. I will say I've kind of gone by the scale, and I've stayed this same weight (between 248 and 251) for almost 3 months. Sleep is usually 7.5 on training days and 8-9 non training.

Also, I train around 5am. I get up around 4, I'll have a banana and creatine, a knock off 5 hour energy and usually 12 ounces of coffee.
I drink a good amount of water during training and sometimes an electrolyte powder in water.

Post workout is always a shake I make with 2 cups whole milk, 1.5 scoops whey, 2 bananas, 1 cup oats, 2 tbsp PB, 1 tbsp vegetable oil. I drink this bad boy within an hour of training. Non workout days I drink the same thing and treat it as breakfast. Next small meal is about 2 hours later, but sometimes not until lunch.

I'm pretty tough, but the fatigue more recently (2.5 or so weeks) has been pretty bad immediately after training and the rest of the day. The day after I feel 90% better.

Could this be a nutrition thing like lack of calories? Should I be aiming for more now that lifts are getting heavier? I'd say I'm 20-25% body fat, most being around midsection. ",2,1741872295.0,StartingStrength,0,1.0,False

If you're anything like me—juggling classes, part-time jobs, social life (what’s left of it), and somehow trying to squeeze in a few hours of sleep—you know that writing papers can feel like climbing Mount Everest… in flip-flops.

A few months ago, I hit a breaking point. Two essays, one research paper, and a group project all due in the same week. Panic mode? Activated. That’s when I found [**PaperCoach**](https://mypapercoach.space/), and honestly, it was like discovering coffee for the first time. Life-changing. So, I thought I’d share my experience for anyone out there silently crying over their laptop at 2 a.m.

# Why I Chose PaperCoach (And Keep Coming Back)

I was super skeptical about paper writing services at first. You hear all these horror stories about plagiarism, missed deadlines, and shady customer support. But after reading dozens of reviews, I decided to give **PaperCoach** a shot. And wow, I’m glad I did.

From the first order, they impressed me with their professionalism, quality, and speed. Whether it’s an essay, research paper, or even a tricky case study, they’ve delivered every time. Below is a quick breakdown of the features I’ve personally found helpful.

|**Advantages**|**Details**|
|:-|:-|
|**Affordable Prices**|Student-friendly rates with discounts for larger orders and returning customers.|

# What Kind of Papers Can They Handle?

One of the things I love about PaperCoach is how versatile they are. They handle pretty much every type of academic assignment. Here are some examples I’ve either ordered myself or seen listed on their site:

* **Essays** (Argumentative, Descriptive, Narrative—you name it)
* **Research Papers**
* **Case Studies**
* **Term Papers**
* **Thesis and Dissertations**
* **Coursework**
* **Book and Movie Reviews**
* **Presentations (with PowerPoint!)**
* **Lab Reports**
* **Programming Assignments**
* **Mathematics and Statistics Homework**

Last semester, I ordered a **15-page research paper on climate change policy**, and my writer not only nailed the topic but also used up-to-date sources and formatted it in flawless APA style. A week later, I panicked over my **statistics homework**, and they handled those tricky regressions like it was a walk in the park. That’s when I knew I had a reliable backup for whenever I felt swamped.

# Is [PaperCoach ](https://mypapercoach.space/)Legit?

I get it—you’re thinking, “Is this too good to be true?” I had the same question. But here’s why I trust them:

1. **Plagiarism-Free Guarantee**: Every paper I’ve received comes with a free plagiarism report.
2. **Confidentiality**: They keep everything 100% private. My professor will never know I got help.
3. **Money-Back Guarantee**: If something goes wrong (hasn’t happened to me yet), they offer refunds.

# How Much Does It Cost?

Their prices start at **just $7 per page** for high school level work with a longer deadline. Of course, the cost goes up if you need something more advanced or super urgent. But they always have **seasonal discounts** and **promo codes**, which makes it easier on the wallet. As a returning customer, I even get loyalty discounts now. Win-win!

# Final Thoughts

If you’re a student struggling to keep your head above water (welcome to the club), I seriously recommend giving PaperCoach a try. They’ve saved me time, stress, and probably my GPA.

Sure, you shouldn’t rely on a service like this all the time—college is about learning, after all—but when life happens, PaperCoach is the safety net you didn’t know you needed.

Married my childhood sweetheart, so I technically never dated. I tried OLD a few years ago with a couple less than desirable outcomes. I just tried meeting others locally with little luck there, those I approach were with someone in one way or another.

I tried OLD once more only so I can actually find “available” women. The first one to respond within a half day of signing up checked all the boxes. We chatted on the phone and everything went amazingly. I already deleted my OLD acct. We met for coffee a few days later and time escaped us.  There was chemistry for sure. Even texted goodnight when we each got home and have been chatting a little every morning. And maybe a time or two during the day. 

So my inquiry is as follows: I am very intrigued and excited, she seems so as well, but I don’t want to over-communicate to the point of annoying or bothering her. We both have younger kids and we respect one another’s family time. There are random times I just want to say hi, but refrain from that. If I say good morning every day, is also saying good night too much? Then I wonder is saying good morning every day too much. I simply do not want my joy to ruin this. It is not an interest of lust, but a cognitive connection. One that I have never really experienced. And people (including me) thought my late wife and I were soulmates. We were an opposites attract couple and it was amazing, she was amazing.  With this girl; our interests align almost in a mirror-like way. One mentions something off the wall, and the other actually has experience in that. This happens over and over.

I feel I really do not want to screw this up, so what is a healthy communication cadence? My gut says to simply ask, but I know some think THAT is a mistake too.",1,1741872032.0,datingoverforty,21,0.67,False

It was a black friday deal and seemed like a good machine for the price (I paid 581 euros). 

About a year ago I had to replace all the grinder parts, last week the machine started to trip the breaker, and since this morning the pump just does not start. I don't really want to spend more money on this machine, to get it fixed.

So I'm looking at a new setup. Because I work from home 4 days and I really enjoy my coffee, I don't mind spending a bit more this time. But I do prefer a setup that hopefully can last a bit longer. I would like to get an espresso machine and a separate grinder. What combination of machine and grinder would you get for a 1500 euro budget? 

Also with 2 young kids the morning routine is already pretty intense, so I prefer a grinder that stores the coffee and has a scale or timer. I don't think a single dose grinder would be the best option for us.o

1jabop2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jabop2,My rabbits are upset at me and don’t trust me anymore,"Sorry for the long post I’m just seeking support. PHOTOS FOR ADDED CUTENESS!!!

I got coffee in May, Luna in august and Pastel in December. I put so much care and effort into bonding with them within these months.

Pastel is still 5 months old (uneutered) so he’s a bit of a spicy less cuddly baby bun. But Coffee is the cuddliest boy and Luna took so long to trust me and in the past months has finally come up to me for pets and is more trusting of me.

Recently I’ve been having a lot of trouble in many areas of life which has led me towards going back into depression and a very poor mental state.

During these months, I kept my routine with the rabbits of cleaning every morning, giving medication if needed, thoroughly grooming Luna once a month and even some bonding sessions between them and me. In addition to basic care. I also always take them to the vet very regularly because the 3 of them are E. Cuniculi positive. 

But last week things got worse for me and I have been many times incapable of cleaning, giving water and feeding them. They are still feed and taken care of, but instead of me doing it I’ve asked my partner who lives with me to do it. Or he just volunteers most times. My partner is familiar with them and their routine and even has helped me with medication and grooming their fur - so he’s no stranger. 

But yesterday I felt sad that I haven’t been spending time with them so I decided to have one on one time with them on the bed. Luna seemed to be the calmest but I noticed a change in trust with me on all of them. All 3 seemed finicky and coffee event ran away from me so I let it go and didn’t bother him too much. It makes me so sad cause he was the cuddliest one.

Today I did the whole routine again by myself and noticed coffee had something on his neck/ chin and got scared so I grabbed him to check if it was hurt or anything bad. It wasn’t, it was just wet probably from the water bowl. But that ended up scaring him more and he thumped at me for the first time in a while!

TLDR: Haven’t been bonding with my bunnies and now they trust me less.

I guess my question is how can I gain back their trust? I worked so hard on our relationship and now I feel like it’s gone back to 0.

I am going to share my whole period from study. I completed my secondary universities in February and started properly studying for step one around mid March. The resources are used were first aid, bnb, u world, pathoma and sketchy in my prededicated.

So this is what my schedule look well like I got a three month schedule somewhere. I’ll share it with you so it focused around 5 to 10 days per system depending on the subject. So I want to use the videos then read the first aid and then I’ll solve the World questions for a day. It typically look like to do three hours of videos, then reading the same part and first aid and whatever system I have done previously I would do one block of that and then review it. This whole took around 3 1/half months so from mid March to June.

I completed my qbank by end of June and I reset it from first July.

I had my internals in July, so half of it was wasted, and I gave  an nbme around mid July. I I barely passed, B5 after 15 days in July end I gave My next NBME And I failed. So, I did a reread of a first aid. for the month of August I gave an NBME every  and in the time between I would do uworld and review the topics I was getting wrong.

So I gave an nbme at around 20 August And decided to schedule my exam. I took a block and  I got it verified by by around 10 days and I  scheduled my date to 26th September. So for the month of September, which was my actual dedicated period I had two nbmes so i did that, also i did all three uwsa and both free 120. I like the free 120 best as an indicator for the exam. WS good about the question length, but not exactly about the type of  as in the exam. I did a final  of first aid. I reviewed all of my NBE  and I read some  the ones I where the arrow one and the ethics one. I made a list of the things which were very volatile and I needed to read the day before the  and  what I  on the 25th.

On the 26th, I gave my exam for food. I took energy bars, protein bars, actually cooked rice ( pulav ) and a coffee,  The exam took more time, then I usually did so prepare for that at home. I was doing around 45  but it took me up to 55 minutes in the real deal so because the   long, but the questions are I thought they were very standard longer  but not very confusing. I marked around 15 questions per block. I think this was because it was a real exam and I was a little anxious, but after I got home, I saw that most of them were right, so don’t panic because of the nervousness and all the best to anyone giving it. If you have any questions, just ask me and should I share my NBMe scores?

just some numbers,  saying this on the top of my head because I don’t  have the actual numbers right now,. If you want the actual percentages, just tell me, I have them written in a book somewhere. by the end of my first world, my average was 60%. I started around 40, but I got the hang pf it by the  time I completed it. I bought my block when my NBME scores crossed 70, my UWS course, where in the 60 to 65 range and my final score around five days before the exam in free on 20 was 78%.",0,1741871650.0,step1,2,0.5,False
1jabnwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1jabnwo/should_i_be_worried_about_my_friend/,Should I be worried about my friend,"So a little bit of context for the story. I am going on a business trip with my father very soon. Im just looking to buy some business casual clothes to wear so I decide to bring one of my gay friend who has a very good sense of style, to come and help me out. Since he's out for spring break from college, I said, why not we can catch up on conversations.

So we have been shopping for a while and he's making sure I have the best clothes possible. Well now we are at JCPenney doing the same routine, when all the sudden he says I have to use the bathroom brb. Ok cool what ever humans got to do what we do. So 10 mins pass by and no big deal we had coffee he can take his time. 18 mins go by and now I'm wondering where he's at. I text him and no response so now im worried. I walk towards the restroom which are down a hall pasted the solan and offices. As im walking I saw a cute guy in a tanktop and smiling. Which was odd but I didnt mind it. 

Finally I make it to the men's restroom and my friend comes out right before I go in. I tell him dude you ok you been there for a while got worried for yah. He then say bro I just gave this man a quick bj.  I'm like ""so you were cruising in a public area??"" I'm aware people do that but here of all place. He says yeah look. 

So he shows me his phone and his on a website called sniffes which I heard of but never had the idea to get on. He shows me that this Jc Penney location is known for crusing in the batroom.  Then he shows me all the map of our area and omg the amount of areas to meet. Places like lowes,home depot,movie theater parking lot, gas station, hell even walmart. But the most creepy part to me is that he was showing where he was at ,on our city map broadcasting his location. He has a pic of him in a circle. I freak out and say so everyone know how you look he say yah I don't mind showing off. Well we move on but now I'm wondering 2 things. 

1 are the place that sniffes shows actual spots to meet ??

2 how safe is sniffes kind of got worried about my friend. Just broadcasting his location to random strangers. 

Tbh I shouldnt be all up in his business but I care for my friends and want to make sure he's safe out there",3,1741871642.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

I was ready for long hours and sore muscles—but soon I realized that my biggest challenge wasn't physical, but emotional.

At first, the language barrier made everyday interactions feel intimidating. Simple things like ordering lunch or chatting with coworkers felt overwhelming. But slowly, I learned that just two words, *""annyeonghaseyo""* (hello) and *""gamsahamnida""* (thank you), could open hearts faster than any perfect sentence.

One day, exhausted after a long shift, a coworker brought me a coffee and smiled warmly. That small gesture reminded me how kindness can bridge any cultural gap. Soon, those small moments added up, making me feel like part of the team.

Working in Korea taught me more than just job skills; it taught me courage and openness. If you're coming to Korea or already here, my best advice is simple: be brave, smile often, and don't fear mistakes—they're just steps in your learning journey.

Trust me, the friendships you'll build and the strength you'll find within yourself will make every challenge worthwhile. Korea isn't just a workplace; it's an opportunity to grow. You've got this!",1,1741870729.0,WorkLifeInKorea,0,1.0,False

What are some of the big issues you are seeing?

  
From my perspective watching the games and being on this and r/NBA etc I have determined these to be some of the glaring ones:

  
1. Bam and Herro cannot seem to have a good game at the same time, as far as scoring goes especially.

2. Ware is in his rookie year, so he just has a lot of growth to do. No reason to go into details because it's pretty obvious he's a rookie oftentimes. Great potential is seen, though.

3. Herro/the team hasn't been able to get him to where he was earlier this year, as teams have adjusted their defense accordingly to make sure Tyler doesn't make it rain on them. I don't think he's in a slump, since he still finds ways to score, but since he gained all-star attention, teams found answers to him.

4. Blown leads, sometimes massive ones. Sometimes this team comes out swinging and can compete with the likes of OKC and CLE, which is impressive all things considered, but we fall apart eventually and the good teams (and bad ones) overtake us in the 4th. And don't forget about 3rd (turd) quarter days.

5. Terry minutes and Terry having a very poor year. I like the guy as a teammate as he seems to believe in them, really try hard, and supports them (herro vs thompson tussle), but we and I'm sure he knows there's a lot of fixing to do here if he continues to get minutes. Which Spo seems intent on doing.

6. No true #1 scoring option. As good as Bam and Herro are, they are not ""the guy"". We really need this, imo.

7. Davion and Wiggins getting acclimated. This just takes time. Davion is exceeding expectations already and I think Wigs will continue to improve.

8. Team doesn't get whistles like the good teams. 3rd to last on FTA. I don't like unethical foul baiting (harden), but Jimmy knew how to draw actual fouls like a beast. I'd like to see Bam get more whistles as he gets aggro in the paint.

9. Questionable Spo rotations and decisions in general? I will never begin to think I would know better than him when it comes to basketball, coaching, or his team, but he is not perfect and some of the things people have called out in the past are hard to disagree with. This one is very debatable.

  
Those are off the top of my head. Any glaring ones I am missing? I haven't had coffee yet so I may be missing a big one.",4,1741870514.0,heat,17,1.0,False

Since that, i realized many of my dreams came true, my ex-boyfriend kept appearing in my dreams cheating on me motnhs ago, and guess why we broke up. I had a dream of my friend telling me to stop posting about sad kind of stuff, and then i found out she was talking to my ex about me. I had a dream of him saying that he felt as if he didn´t give me enough time to love him, and days later we had a talk around that topic. I went to a park i had no idea it was in my neighbourhood and seeing the people there made me realize that i dreamt about it, or maybe i didn´t and it was a deja vu?

1jab8ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoingToSpain/comments/1jab8ia/must_see_sights_while_driving_from_baqueira_beret/,Must see sights while driving from Baqueira Beret to Barcelona?,"Will be driving to Barcelona from Baqueria Beret in about a week. Wondering if there are any must see sights/hikes(less than 4 hours)/scenic views/castles/unique attractions that we should make time for on the drive. We don't have the time to stay overnight, but we would love to take our time on the drive by seeing any must see attractions/smaller hikes.

A straight shot drive to Barcelona is about 4.5 hours, we are are comfortable with extending the trip to about 10 hours. Any places we should make time for on the drive? Or should we just go straight to Barcelona?

We can take two different routes, one takes us into Barcelona from the South West (N-260 > C-13 > L-512), the other route takes us into Barcelona from the North East (N-260 > C-16). I would guess the second option has better mountain views.

Ideas so far:

* Bagergue - Village just north of Baqueria Beret. Seems nice to get a coffee and take in the views to start the drive.
* Castell de Rialp - cool looking old castle. (both routes pass through here)
* Pedraforca - beautiful mountain. several trails around 4 hours. (North East Route)
* Baga - nice little old mountain town. (North East Route)
* Vineyards of the Penedès Region - vineyards close to Barcelona. (South West Route)
* Montblanc - a little out of the way medieval town, but looks really cool. (South West Route)

They pay for essentially a small appartment (one living room with kitchenette in one corner, bedroom and bathroom) within a big house and get meals made in a big shared dining room. 
On occasion (maybe once a month for an hour or so) we will visit in a large group (6 adults and 4 under 5's) sitting in the shared conservatory area. When any other resident has wanted to join us then one of us will give up a seat. We chat, the children play (probably at least 50% out side in the large garden), and all have a nice time. 

We have been told that there is too much of a burden on the staff when we all visit and the residents do not feel comfortable when we take over the shared space. We believe this to be false since we all know the residents by name, they interact with the kids etc. There are once couple who keep to themselves but this is all the time, not just when we visit. Plus the only burden on staff is maybe washing extra coffee cups and that the kids eat some of the biscuits that are put out. 

What can we say legally to rebut this? My grandparent is surely allowed any guest they want within reasonable hours? 


Edit: Thanks for some very quick responses. My family is definitely hurt by this, my grandparent especially.  I'm angry but I see they're within their rights to ask whatever of us.

I just remembered that they sang it and then I'm somewhere else, far away.

Just earlier, I randomly came across that song while looking for something else from that time period, unrelated to my trauma, and now I'm starting to remember stuff. Like going around the corner to the hang-out spot of the crowd I hung with, and that the main bully would start singing it and everyone else would think it was funny and do the same. I just remember feeling so ostracized, sad and alone. It was what kickstarted my habbit of skipping school entirely and eventually dropping out. My ""friends"" either sang along or just did nothing, and one even told the bullies info about me to use as fuel so they could tailor the song to torment me more intensely.

This is far from the worst thing I experienced, but it was easily the most ""fuck off, nobody likes you"" period of my life. In my language, the lyrics basically went ""fuck off you pig, you're too ugly for me"".  There was more to the song, but I am not ready to listen to nor read the lyrics further for now.

I am thankful that the local library had computers that I could play RuneScape on. It helped to immerse myself in another world, and the head librarian was really kind to me by letting me sit there all day despite there being a 1 hour/day limit on the computer use, and also gave me hot choco-milk for free from the coffee machine. having grown up with a borderline mother, no father, and a mildly abusive sister, I'm glad I had a father figure in the game, as well as an older sister and a sort of mother figure too. I think that really saved me. Ironically, my ""game dad"" had the username ""The Pinhead"". I should've sent the Hellraiser after my tormentors, lol.

It's over a week until my next session with my EMDR therapist, so I felt the need to get it out somehow, somewhere instead of ruminating and playing this shit over and over again in my head. I figured this would be the best place to vent.

1jab1ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wawa/comments/1jab1ss/is_wawa_doomed/,Is Wawa Doomed?,"So I went into a store today to get the $5 combo.  Everything about the visit showed why customer count is struggling. First I go to get a sizzli, only two selections available....the least popular ones.  Not a hashbrown in site.  

So I say to myself: ""Self, you don't really need a hashbrown, but you are getting that 'deal'.  Give em a couple of minutes to execute.""  I go order my iced coffee and return to pay.  Tell the cashier to ring me up for whatever sizzli but not to worry about the hashbrown. In my mind I'm thinking I know how it will (should) work out for me.  I tell Cashier that there are no hash browns (and won't be any for at least 8 minutes-I can see the oven) so I'm just getting the sizzli and iced coffee.  Cashier explains that it's cheaper to get the hashbrown.  I tell Cashier it's even cheaper if you hit that register button for me that says the hashbrown isn't available. He takes care of it and I pay my 4 bucks.  

Pick up my iced coffee and it tastes like coffee flavored water.  Maybe it's me. I go wait for whatever sizzli is the first acceptable one to come out.  I see the sizzli Associate having a conversation with some people and I'm like see, this is what Wawa is all about, that neighborhood store feeling.  Then I hear the sizzli ovens going off....I can see that it's every shelf.  Conversation continues for at least 30 or 45 seconds and at this point I know the Sizzli I'm waiting for is toast...literally.  Once the Associate removes the trays I see that someone has figured out a cooking hack. The cheese is already on the egg patty!  So that's why it needed to cook extra long...to get that egg patty to proper temperature and get that cheese all melty for me.   F the other components and food safety, sacrifices must made in the name of efficiency.  Take my sizzli and roll.

Sizzli is a horrible sodium laced mess.  Egg patty not hot and of course the bread was crunchy.  

If this is how the main focus is being executed, I'm concerned.  I know this was a blip and many stores are executing flawlessly.  It would be incorrect to assume that a near empty store should translate to a better experience.  Wawas usually perform their best when forced to work efficiently to move the crowd. However, I came in for this deal and left disappointed enough that I wouldn't think of coming back for it.

Ultimately, what really is the central nervous system of the company is its values. Feels like the values have been replaced by mantras and sports analogies.  No one is really verifying that things are being done right. I've seen companies that think that growth is the cure all, find themselves stranded without core customers to support that growth.  They eventually have to get back to what got them there. If Wawa doesn't learn that lesson now, they will learn it in the future...the hard way. ",0,1741869739.0,Wawa,5,0.29,False

I bring my lunch from home every day—usually something simple like a turkey sandwich, chips, and a piece of fruit—because I’m trying to save money and eat healthier. I keep it in the office fridge, labeled with my name in big Sharpie letters on the bag. You’d think that’d be enough, right? Nope. For the last three weeks, someone’s been stealing my lunch. Not every day, but at least twice a week. I’ll go to grab it at noon, and poof—it’s gone. No note, no apology, just an empty spot where my food used to be.

At first, I thought it was a mistake. Like, maybe someone grabbed it by accident and felt too awkward to say anything. So I started putting little Post-it notes on it like, “Hey, this is [my name]’s lunch, please don’t take it!” Still kept happening. I asked around casually—nobody fessed up. I even brought it up in a team meeting (without accusing anyone directly), saying, “Hey, let’s all respect each other’s stuff in the fridge.” My manager nodded, but nothing changed. I was pissed. I work hard to meal prep, and honestly, I can’t afford to keep buying takeout just because some jerk thinks my lunch is fair game.

Last week, I’d had enough. I decided to set a trap. I made a really good-looking turkey and avocado sandwich—extra mayo, fresh bread, the works—and before packing it, I sprinkled a decent dose of powdered laxative into the mayo. Not enough to, like, send someone to the hospital, but definitely enough to make them regret their life choices for a few hours. I mixed it in so you couldn’t tell, labeled it like usual, and put it in the fridge. Then I waited.

Around 1 PM, I went to “check” on my lunch, and surprise, surprise—it was gone again. I didn’t say anything, just grabbed coffee and watched. About an hour later, one of my coworkers, “Jake” (33M), started shifting uncomfortably at his desk. Then he got up, speed-walked to the bathroom, and didn’t come back for a solid 20 minutes. This happened three more times that afternoon. He looked miserable—pale, sweaty, the whole deal. By the end of the day, he left early, muttering something about “food poisoning.”

The next day, Jake came in complaining to everyone about how he “must’ve eaten something bad” and spent the night glued to the toilet. I couldn’t hold it in anymore—I pulled him aside and confronted him. I said, “Hey, Jake, my lunch went missing again yesterday, and you were the only one who looked like you regretted your lunch choices. Was it you?” He turned red, stammered something about how I had “no proof,” and then stormed off. Later that day, I found out he went to HR and complained about me “tampering with food.” He even told our boss, claiming I’d tried to “poison” him. HR didn’t do anything—they just said it was a “he said, he said” situation with no evidence and dropped it. My boss, though? He thought it was hilarious. He pulled me aside, laughed his ass off, and said, “That’s one way to solve it, just don’t make it a habit.”

Since then, my lunch hasn’t been touched, so I’m pretty sure Jake was the thief. But now he’s furious with me. He won’t even look at me, hasn’t spoken to me in a week, and gives me the cold shoulder whenever we’re in the same room. My girlfriend thinks I went too far and should’ve just let HR handle it, even though they’re useless. I get that spiking my lunch wasn’t exactly noble, but I was fed up, and it worked.

My ex broke up with me almost 2 months ago, we dated 2 years. He treated me quite bad before and after the breakup, said he didn’t love me anymore and did some traumatic things to me and I’ve been left to deal with a lot of it myself. He turned avoidant after the breakup and ghosted me, though we did meet for coffee a few times after. I’m no contact with him now (2 weeks) and since last week I’ve been feeling a lot better. I don’t really cry anymore and my appetite is back. I’m really lonely but am accepting being by myself now and just wanna meet new people now and move on myself. 

My ex moved on fast which surprised me because we were each other’s first love. He has a busy social life and things to distract him. I think he’s already talking to a new girl after just a month of us breakup up too which is disappointing. I was so depressed after the breakup and begged for him back but he just didn’t care. I ignored all the bad things he did to me because I was so attached to him and couldn’t move on. But now I can say I don’t love him anymore and the memories I have of him are fading and I don’t really look fondly on them anymore. This is really weird because a couple weeks ago I wanted to die and couldn’t see a point in living. 

I don’t think I’ve fully moved on though. I still think about him all the time and check his socials. It’s hard not to even though I know I shouldn’t. I think part of the reason I’ve moved on faster than I anticipated was because of his awful he acted to me towards the end of the relationship and after the breakup. Ghosting me, giving me mixed signals, acting so careless and showing no empathy towards me despite how depressed he knew I was. He’s a completely different person to the person he was in the relationship. I’m done being upset over someone who treated me like that and wasn’t even worth it. I still dream about him though.

I just have a hard time comprehending how he can be so fine and move on so fast after everything I did for him. Why does he want to move on so fast, why can’t he just stay single and work on himself and heal himself?…",4,1741869259.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

1jaau31,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1jaau31/a_new_askgaybros_faq/,A new AskGayBros FAQ,"Having been a part of this illustrious community for several months now, I think I’ve picked up the tenor of the questions asked to the point I can offer a (completely non-serious) boilerplate FAQ:

1. You’re literally the only person in the world with your niche fetish. There’s only one person who likes what you like. One out of seven billion people, and it’s you. 

2. Douching is an esoteric, dark art. One should not ask The Bottoms how to perform it unless they are prepared to dedicate their lives to sorcery. 

3. You’re gay, or you’re bi, or straight-curious, or maybe you’re gay. Perhaps you’re gay. Could be. I can’t tell you. 

4. You’re the only person on earth who finds [category of men in the range of millions] attractive. You’re the only one. One out of seven billion people. 

5. Yes you’re weird, and that’s alright. 

6. Just go to the doctor or a free clinic or something. Even if it’s not sex related. When’s the last time you had your blood pressure checked?

7. Your boyfriend was totally wrong and also a monster sent from hell to torment you. That’s the only explanation for their flaws. At no point should you be introspective about the breakup. Show no weakness. 

8. Trans people are. That’s about as far as the consensus goes. Nobody bothered to ask Trans people how they feel. This is more of a national (American) thing than a gay community thing. 

9. The last time someone was so so insistent on their racial preferences, they were on trial in Nuremberg in 1945. 

10. Go to the gym I guess? Cigarettes and coffee and ~1500 calories is the alternative, but that’ll make you lightheaded all day. I don’t recommend it.

11. That straight dude will totally make an exception for you. Just like you’ll make an exception for the woman who is really into you, right?

12. Please stop putting fruit/vegetables/anything lacking a flared bottom into your anus. Please. 

13. Everybody KNOWS you’re gay. They knew it before you did. 

14. My dad once told me, completely without solicitation, “Threesomes always end up with two people only.” And I’ve never been able to find a more compelling argument against polyamory than that. 

15. Apps are like lotto tickets. The odds of you hitting it big are so small that using them is akin to genuine mental illness. Then again, you might meet someone cool so keep scratching I guess.

16. Gold Star Gays are the Calvinists of the 21st century. That’s either really good or bad depending on where you stand, but it’s really interesting to watch the debate unfold.

Looking back then - when I got my NCLEX results back, and I PASSED! I’m still in shock, honestly, because my test felt like a rollercoaster designed to break me. I had back-to-back SATA questions-you know, those ""select all that apply"" monsters that make you question if you’ve ever even heard of nursing. I walked out of the testing center convinced I’d bombed it, but here I am, officially an RN! I wanted to share what got me through the prep (and the panic), because some resources seriously saved my sanity.
First off, shoutout to Mark K lectures. If you haven’t listened to this guy, you’re missing out. He’s like that cool uncle who explains things so simply you wonder why you ever found them confusing. I’d pop in my earbuds and listen to him break down ABGs or cardiac meds while I was folding laundry or pacing my apartment. His way of tying concepts together made them stick when I needed them most—like when I was staring at a SATA about priority interventions and somehow didn’t blank out.
Then there was Naxlex. I stumbled on this gem while looking for practice questions that actually mimicked the NCLEX vibe. Their bank of questions was clutch-especially for getting used to those tricky SATA formats. I’d do a set every morning with my coffee, and it helped me spot my weak areas (hello, pharmacology). The explanations were super clear too, which kept me from spiraling into “I’ll never get this” territory.
And of course, U-World. I know everyone raves about it, but there’s a reason—it’s brutal in the best way. Those questions hit hard, and the rationales? Gold. I’d sit there with my laptop, highlighter in hand, dissecting every answer I got wrong until I could explain it to my dog (he’s a great listener). U-World was my reality check—it toughened me up for the real deal, especially when the test threw curveballs like “select all the side effects of this obscure med.”
The test itself? Wild. It shut off at 85 questions, and I swear I aged five years in those two hours. The SATA streak hit me around question 40, and I just kept muttering, “Breathe, you’ve got this.” I think all those practice runs with Naxlex and U-World kept me from totally losing it. And Mark K’s voice in my head? That was the secret weapon reminding me to prioritize and think logically.
So, if you’re prepping and terrified of SATAs or the NCLEX in general-hang in there! It’s doable. Load up on Mark K lectures for the big-picture stuff, drill Naxlex for practice, and let U-World sharpen your edge. You’ll walk out of that test center (or crawl, no judgment) and still make it to the other side.",9,1741868856.0,NclexFirstAttempt,10,0.92,False

1jaapl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1jaapl2/9_nights_trip_report/,9 nights trip report,"I wanted to share what a lovely time I had in Puerto Rico in February. I traveled with my 70 something parents and my eight-year-old.

We arrived late on a Sunday night to San Juan. Because we knew we would be arriving late, we booked at the airport hotel. It was extremely clean and the people were very nice.

It is however, very very far from the baggage claim/gates. We eventually snagged a wheelchair for my mom.

They had a nice basic breakfast included in the morning

That morning we got up and got our rental car and drove to old San Juan, just 10 minutes away and parked in the garage, which is necessary for tourists. We walked through the city, my son and I splitting off from my parents who need to take it slower. Our goal is to make it all the way to the fortress, but it was incredibly hot so we only made it like halfway there. Plus, my son really enjoyed seeing the baby chicks wandering around one of the children’s parks.

Around 1 o’clock, We were hungry for lunch, but cruise ships had arrived and old San Juan became incredibly crowded, so we got the rental car and headed for our next destination, which was Fajardo.

We stopped for lunch along the way, and made it to our next destination, which was the Fajardo Inn. We selected it because they were activities on site such as a pool with a waterslide and a little mini golf course.
The mini golf course was incredibly damaged, but it was still a nice little activity.

I would say a major problem was how terribly inaccessible the entire hotel was. My mother has great difficulty walking, and none of the elevators were working, and they wouldn’t make Any accommodations for us to get her down to the pool more comfortably. (there was a spot where we could easily drop her off with the car and then drive back up the hill and park, but they wouldn’t allow us.)

There was also nothing included like coffee in the morning. There was a tiny bit cute children’s play area that had arcade games so that was fun.

Day three we toured El Yunque , and it was actually really easy to navigate the many stops while accommodating my mother‘s disabilities. The temperatures were quite comfortable, I expected the rainforest to be uncomfortably hot, but it was nothing compared to a New York summer day

Day four we did a catamaran tour, which was nice. We got to see some fish

Day, five we made our way along the southern coast toward Rincon.

We enjoyed a scenic drive, and stopped in Ponce city center for a little walk around and lunch. We all really liked Ponce and if we go again, we’d love to spend a night or two in that city. It had a very different vibe than the other places we stayed and it was very pretty.

We arrived in Rincon where we spent four nights. Rincon is SUCH a common destination for New York City tourists,  that we thought it might be too built up and touristy. But we were wrong, it ended up being a ton of fun and very beautiful, with lots of locals. We even attended church, it was a very nice experience.

BQN airport is so so tiny, and very cute, I think it’s worth letting people know, you have to allow your bags to be inspected before you get around to checking in and checking the bags. There’s also no shops as you might expect at a larger airport so if you were supposed to grab souvenirs for anyone, make sure you get it before hand.

Long story short, I’m glad I finally made it to Puerto Rico and will be happy to go again sometime in the future.

1jaamn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokesuncensored/comments/1jaamn7/little_girl/,Little girl,"""A young family moved into a house, next to a vacant lot.

One day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.

The young family's 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.

Eventually the construction crew, all of them ""gems-in-the-rough,"" more or less, adopted her as a kind of project mascot.""

They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.

At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.

The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars ""pay"" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.

When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

The little girl proudly replied, ""I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.""

""Oh my goodness gracious,"" said the teller, and will you be working on the house again this week, too?""

The little girl replied, ""I will, if those as*!#!es at Home Depot ever deliver the fu*#'ng sheet rock...""",5,1741868360.0,Jokesuncensored,0,0.86,False

A bit about me, I’m 28 years old, queer, liberal, and an INFJ (if you’re curious about that). I have a couple of piercings, no tattoos (yet); and am the kind of person to prefer a night talking on a patio about interesting, philosophical topics over coffee, going hiking, or spending the day at the library reading new books on interesting topics versus clubbing and partying. 

I write poetry, make art, and while depression and work has made it hard to do these consistently in my day-to-day, really want to make the journey back again to being a more creative person again. 

As it comes to music, I really love shoegaze, folk, alternative, rock, dreampop, and punk. Some of my favorite musicians are Loathe, Narrow Head, Cigarettes After S*x, Nirvana, Sufjan Stevens, Iron & Wine, Tame Impala, Ethel Cain, Julien Baker, and Phoebe Bridgers. 

As an introvert, I don’t have many friends, but the new friend(s) I make here are ones I want to truly cultivate. I’m not one to ghost, and if we just don’t connect, I’ll be honest with you (obviously not in a mean way). 

Anyways, if any of the above resonates with you and is something you relate to, I hope to hear from you and make a new connection! ",3,1741868344.0,friendship,1,1.0,False
