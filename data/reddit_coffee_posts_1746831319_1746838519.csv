And a friend pointed out that this seems to happen on Fridays, accompanied by a really not so great weekend. Even though there‚Äôs no reason for the weekend not to be a good one. 

For example last week in the middle of the week I was like fuck yeah, ima take my kid to the beach and get pizza and iced coffee it will be such a fun day! Weekend gets there and nope. I wasn‚Äôt miserable or anything, it‚Äôs not depression. It‚Äôs just me feeling off, not being able to relax or enjoy anything. 

Does this happen to anyone else?

Psychiatrist won‚Äôt give me an SSRI to treat it. So instead she gave me hydroxyzine. Which doesn‚Äôt seem to really help at all, it will prevent a panic attack but I‚Äôm still sitting here short of breath and with other symptoms. It will knock my ass out though and put me to sleep. That‚Äôs no way to live. I needed it at work and got so tired, upon leaving a voicemail for someone I noticed my speech slow and I lost my train of thought, almost didn‚Äôt make it through that message. I was too tired when I got home to get my kid going with his night time routine so my husband had to get dinner going and do everything himself. 

I googled the hell out of this, even seen some older posts here about weekend anxiety. People seem to sometimes fear not being busy? That doesn‚Äôt make sense my whole weekend is packed! What do you guys think?",1,1746838401.0,BipolarReddit,0,1.0,False

Before that, I used to have 2 to 5 projections a week. The longest streak I had ever managed was just 2 days.

On my fourth day, I figured maybe I just got lucky.
On the fifth day, I thought: Okay, this isn‚Äôt luck.
By the sixth day, I was sure.

I started seeking out communities‚Äîanyone or anywhere I could talk about it. I was both excited and full of questions. That‚Äôs when I began posting on r/AstralProjection. On my sixth day in a row, I made a post out of sheer excitement, and it literally broke records. As of now, it has more than 70,000 views, 300+ upvotes, and hundreds of comments.

I made sure to respond to everyone in the comments. People were super engaging, and it felt great.
But when I tried posting on r/HowToLucidDream, my post got deleted twice. I guess it was seen as too controversial‚Äîor maybe just too unbelievable.

So what did I say?
Why did I suddenly start having these consistent streaks?

Cigarettes.

I use the WBTB (Wake Back To Bed) method‚Äîit works like magic. I don‚Äôt meditate or visualize regularly, though sometimes I naturally think about my journeys, which might count as visualization in a way. But mainly, it‚Äôs just WBTB and intention.

That alone had gotten me to 2 to 5 projections a week. But one night, I decided to have a cigarette during WBTB. That night, I had three projections.

That‚Äôs when I knew‚Äîit was the cigarettes.
On the third day of my streak, I literally said: ‚ÄúOh man, it‚Äôs the cigarettes.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm approaching my 12th day. It‚Äôs 3:45 AM as I write this. I‚Äôm up for WBTB, having two cigarettes, fully confident I‚Äôll AP tonight.

This post assumes you know what WBTB means.
If you‚Äôre a non-smoker, try coffee or nicotine gum‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt tested those myself, but if they work for you, share your streaks here.

Pros

\- Always responds back, with quite thoughtful responses

\- Followed me on her private account and let me follow her back. 95% of the followers are girls, I'm one of only 3 of her followers that are men but not LGBT. 

\- She remembered key dates, such as when my exams were and texted me good luck without me ""reminding""

\- She seemed very keen when I ask if she wants to hang out. She rescheduled her day to accommodate me for our first coffee ""date"". 

\- She knew about my job (I work in a very niche field)

\- She likes / hearts many of my Instagram stories (not all). 

\- On our first ""date"" after I dropped her off she looked back twice and blushed as I waved at her (think she might have wanted me to make a move.

\- She took the plushy I got her and sent me a picture of it on her bed 

  
Cons:

\- I text her first more often than she does. 

\- Her energy on text is far different to how she is in real life - she is bubblier outside compared to texting.

Hello everyone,

My mom would like an espresso machine. So for Mother‚Äôs Day I wanted to get her one. I am honestly confused which one to get, they‚Äôre all so different. I‚Äôm leaning towards semi automatic because it would be easier for her to use. I also see a lot of nice automatic ones but have read reviews that they break much easily. We have a store nearby that grinds beans for you when you buy coffee beans. Reading through many reviews, I know a lot of people have said the problem with semi automatic machines is that they break because of the constant use of the grinder. I am looking at breville right now. I have this one in mind https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WMLXXG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_K0GH3JZ0P558QJ6GGKW4&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_K0GH3JZ0P558QJ6GGKW4&social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_K0GH3JZ0P558QJ6GGKW4&previewDoh=1

1kixrv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightscheap/comments/1kixrv2/maximize_your_travel_savings_with_airbnb_and/,Maximize Your Travel Savings with Airbnb and Flight Packages: A Comprehensive Guide,"The world of travel, once a complicated labyrinth of booking flights here and accommodation there, is getting a serious upgrade. We're talking about streamlining, bundling, and simplifying the whole shebang. Forget opening a dozen tabs and juggling confirmation emails like a circus performer. The future, my friends, looks a whole lot like a neat little package that sorts out your wings to get there and your nest once you arrive. This isn't just about convenience (though that's a huge perk!), it's about unlocking different types of travel experiences, potentially saving some serious dough, and making the whole planning process less of a headache and more of a breeze. So, are you ready to dive into this brave new world of travel booking?

The Allure of Combining Your Flight and Your Cozy Corner of the World
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Think about it: you've got the destination in mind, the dates are set, and the wanderlust is practically radiating off you. But then reality hits. First, you've gotta snag those flights. And let's be real, the price of a ticket can fluctuate more wildly than a toddler's mood swings. You spend hours on comparison sites, trying to time it just right, hoping you haven't missed a flash sale. Then, the accommodation hunt begins. Do you want a swanky hotel with room service and a mini-bar that costs more than your flight? An independent boutique hotel with character? Or the ever-popular and increasingly diverse world of Airbnb? Each option has its pros and cons, and finding the perfect fit can be another time-consuming endeavor. This is where the magic of bundling starts to look awfully appealing.

### Why ""Airbnb and Flight Packages"" Are Gaining Traction

It's no secret that booking elements of your trip together can often result in savings. Travel agencies have been doing it for decades with their traditional hotel and flight packages. But Airbnb, with its unique offering of homes, apartments, and quirky stays, has opened up a whole new dimension. Combining the flexibility and local flavor of an Airbnb with the necessity of air travel just‚Ä¶ makes sense. It's like peanut butter and jelly ‚Äì good on their own, but even better together. For travelers seeking not just a place to sleep but an **immersive experience**, an Airbnb can be a game-changer. You're living in a neighborhood, potentially cooking local ingredients in your own kitchen, and getting a different perspective than staying in a typical tourist hotel. And being able to book that perfect Airbnb and your flights in one fell swoop? Well, that's just icing on the cake.

Unpacking the Benefits: What's in it for You?
---------------------------------------------

Let's be honest, we all love a good deal. And while combining flights and Airbnb isn't always a guaranteed ninety percent off everything, it often presents opportunities for significant savings compared to booking each component separately. Think of it as a volume discount for your vacation. But the benefits extend far beyond just the bottom line. It's about simplifying, streamlining, and making the travel planning process less of a chore and more of an exciting prelude to your adventure.

### The Sweet, Sweet Savings

Okay, let's talk turkey. The most compelling reason for many travelers to consider Airbnb and flight packages is the potential for cost reduction. How does this magic happen? Airlines and accommodation providers often have agreements or partnerships that allow them to offer bundled deals at a lower price than if each service were purchased individually. It's like buying a combo meal at your favorite restaurant ‚Äì you typically pay less than ordering the burger, fries, and drink separately. This is particularly true during off-peak seasons or for popular routes where companies are competing fiercely for your business. Plus, sometimes these packages include perks or discounts on activities, car rentals, or local tours, adding even more value to the bundle.

### The Time-Saving Superpower

Let's not underestimate the value of time. In our busy lives, spending hours clicking through different websites, comparing prices, and hoping for the best can be downright exhausting. Booking ""Airbnb and flight packages"" consolidates this process. You're typically looking at a single platform or website to select your dates, choose your flight options, and browse available Airbnb properties. No more bouncing between multiple sites, keeping track of different booking references, and praying you haven't accidentally double-booked something. It's a significant reduction in the cognitive load of travel planning, freeing up your mental energy for the fun stuff, like dreaming about your itinerary or brushing up on some local phrases.

### A More Seamless Planning Experience

Imagine researching flights, then opening a separate browser window to look at Airbnbs, trying to cross-reference your dates and desired location, and then going *back* to the flight site to see if the prices have changed since you started looking. It's a fragmented and potentially frustrating process. Bundling brings it all together in one place. You can see the availability of Airbnbs that align with your chosen flight dates and vice versa. This integrated approach makes the planning feel more cohesive and less like you're piecing together a puzzle with missing pieces. It's about creating a smooth flow from inspiration to confirmation.

### Potentially Enhanced Flexibility

While traditional package deals can sometimes feel rigid, Airbnb and flight packages often offer a surprising degree of flexibility, especially when booked through platforms that specialize in this type of bundling. You're not necessarily locked into a specific hotel chain; you have the vast and varied world of Airbnb at your fingertips. This means you can choose an accommodation that truly suits your travel style, whether you're a solo adventurer looking for a cozy studio, a family needing space to spread out, or a group of friends wanting a place to kick back and relax together. The ability to filter by amenities, location, and even the host's personality adds a layer of personalization that traditional packages might lack.

Navigating the Nuances: What to Keep in Mind
--------------------------------------------

Alright, so the idea of bundled travel sounds pretty darn good, right? But just like anything worth having, there are always a few things to consider before jumping headfirst into booking. While ""Airbnb and flight packages"" offer undeniable advantages, it's crucial to be a savvy traveler and understand the potential downsides or limitations.

### The ""Is It *Really* Cheaper?"" Question

While savings are a major draw, it's vital to do your due diligence. Bundled deals are *often* cheaper, but not *always*. Sometimes, a killer flight sale combined with a last-minute Airbnb deal booked independently might actually come out slightly cheaper. The key is to use these packages as a starting point for your comparison. Check the price of the package against the cost of booking the flight and the Airbnb separately on their respective platforms. This is where a little bit of legwork can pay off. Think of it like grocery shopping ‚Äì sometimes buying the pre-made meal is a good deal, but sometimes buying the individual ingredients and making it yourself is cheaper (and perhaps more satisfying!).

### Understanding the Cancellation Policies

This is a big one. When you book a package, the cancellation policies can be a bit more complex than booking individual components. You're often subject to the package provider's terms, which might be different from the airline's or Airbnb's standard policies. Before hitting that ""book"" button, take the time to read the fine print regarding cancellations, modifications, and refunds. What happens if your flight is canceled? What if you need to change your dates? Knowing the policy upfront can save you a world of headaches down the road. Don't just assume everything is fully refundable; you know what they say about assuming, right?

### The Limited Selection Conundrum

While the Airbnb world is vast, when you're booking through a package provider, the selection of available Airbnbs might be curated or limited. You might not have access to the *entire* catalog of every single listing on Airbnb's platform. This can be a drawback if you have a very specific type of Airbnb in mind or if you're traveling during peak season when popular properties book up quickly. Think of it like shopping at a department store versus a specialty boutique ‚Äì the department store has a wide variety, but the boutique might have that one unique item you're searching for.

### Potential Lack of Customization

While package deals offer convenience, they might sometimes lack the granular level of customization that booking separately allows. For example, you might not have as many options for flight times or specific types of tickets (like choosing a premium seat). Similarly, while you can filter Airbnbs, you might not be able to negotiate directly with the host for things like early check-in or late check-out as easily as you could if you booked directly through the Airbnb platform. It's a trade-off between convenience and complete control over every single detail.

Where Can You Find These Magical Bundles?
-----------------------------------------

So, where does one actually go to find these elusive ""Airbnb and flight packages?"" The good news is that as this type of travel planning gains popularity, more platforms and providers are offering these combined options. It's not a one-stop shop just yet, but the landscape is evolving quickly.

### Online Travel Agencies (OTAs)

Many of the big names in online travel are now offering the option to bundle flights with Airbnb stays. Think of the usual suspects that you've probably used for booking hotels and flights before. These platforms leverage their existing relationships with airlines and have integrated with Airbnb to provide these package options. They often have user-friendly interfaces that allow you to search, compare, and book in one place. Keep an eye out for filters that specifically allow you to search for packages that include ""Vacation Rentals"" or ""Apartments,"" as this is often how Airbnb listings are categorized within their systems.

### Airline and Airbnb Partnerships

Some airlines are forging direct partnerships with Airbnb to offer bundled deals. This can be a great option if you have a preferred airline or are part of a loyalty program. Booking through the airline's website might give you access to exclusive deals or allow you to earn loyalty points on your entire package. Similarly, Airbnb itself is also exploring ways to integrate flight booking into its platform, though this is still an evolving area. Imagine browsing Airbnbs in a city and having flight options pop up alongside the listings ‚Äì that's the kind of seamless integration we're talking about!

### Specialty Package Providers

Beyond the major players, there are also websites and travel agencies that specialize in creating unique travel packages, and some of these are starting to incorporate Airbnb options. These providers might focus on specific types of travel (e.g., adventure travel, family vacations) or destinations, and they curate experiences that include flights and hand-picked Airbnb accommodations. These can be a good option if you're looking for a more tailored or niche travel experience that goes beyond the standard offerings.

Tips and Tricks for Booking with Bundles
----------------------------------------

Okay, you're sold on the idea of ""Airbnb and flight packages."" You've seen the potential benefits, and you're ready to dive in. But before you click ""book,"" here are a few tips and tricks to make sure you get the best possible deal and experience.

### Be Flexible with Your Dates

Just like booking flights or Airbnbs separately, being flexible with your travel dates can unlock significant savings when booking packages. If your schedule allows, play around with different departure and return dates. Sometimes shifting your trip by even a day or two can drastically impact the package price. Mid-week departures often tend to be cheaper than weekend ones, and traveling during the shoulder season (the time between peak and off-peak season) can offer a sweet spot of good weather and lower prices.

### Compare, Compare, Compare!

I can't stress this enough. While the package price might look attractive, it's absolutely crucial to compare it against the cost of booking the flight and the Airbnb separately. Use flight comparison websites and check Airbnb directly for the same dates and location. Don't just take the package price at face value. A little bit of legwork here can mean the difference between a good deal and a phenomenal one.

### Read Reviews of Both the Flight and the Airbnb

When you're booking a package, you're essentially committing to both a flight experience and an accommodation experience. Take the time to read reviews for both the airline *and* the specific Airbnb listing you're considering. What do past travelers say about the flight experience? Are there consistent complaints about delays or customer service? What do guests say about the cleanliness, location, and overall experience of the Airbnb? Reviews are an invaluable resource from fellow travelers who have been there and done that.

### Pay Attention to the Details of the Package

What exactly is included in the package price? Is it just the flight and the Airbnb stay? Are there any hidden fees or taxes that aren't clearly listed upfront? Does the package include checked baggage fees or airport transfers? Understanding the full scope of what you're paying for is essential to avoid unpleasant surprises down the road. Read the description carefully and don't be afraid to reach out to the package provider if you have any questions.

### Consider the Location of the Airbnb

While a fantastic Airbnb deal might seem exciting, consider its location in relation to what you want to do on your trip. Is it conveniently located near public transportation? Is it within walking distance of attractions, restaurants, or shops? A great price won't feel so great if you're spending a fortune on taxis or spending hours commuting to everything you want to see and do. Think about how the location fits into your overall travel plans.

The Future of Bundled Travel: What's Next?
------------------------------------------

The world of travel is constantly evolving, driven by technology and changing traveler preferences. What can we expect from ""Airbnb and flight packages"" in the future? It's a safe bet to assume that this trend is only going to continue to grow and become more sophisticated.

### Increased Integration and Personalization

Expect to see even deeper levels of integration between flight search and Airbnb availability. As technology advances, platforms will likely offer more personalized recommendations based on your past travel history, preferences, and even browsing behavior. Imagine a future where a platform suggests Airbnbs based on your desired travel style (e.g., ""cozy cabin in the mountains,"" ""city apartment with a view"") and shows you the corresponding flight options that fit your dates.

### More Diverse Package Options

The bundling possibilities are likely to expand beyond just flights and Airbnbs. We could see packages that include activities, tours, or even local experiences curated by the Airbnb host. This would create a truly all-in-one travel package that caters to specific interests and provides a more immersive and hassle-free experience.

### Greater Transparency and Flexibility

As this market matures, there will hopefully be increased transparency regarding pricing breakdowns and cancellation policies. Competition among providers will also likely lead to more flexible options, allowing travelers more control over their choices within the bundle.

### The Rise of Niche Bundling

Just as there are specialty travel agencies today, we could see the rise of platforms that specialize in bundling flights and Airbnbs for niche travel segments. For example, packages tailored for remote workers seeking long-term stays, families traveling with pets, or adventurers looking for unique off-the-beaten-path Airbnbs combined with specific flight routes.

My Personal Experience (Well, a Hypothetical One)
-------------------------------------------------

Let me tell you, if I were planning a trip to, say, Lisbon, the idea of using an Airbnb and flight package would be seriously appealing. I'm not a fan of spending hours toggling between websites. The thought of finding a charming Airbnb in the Alfama district, soaking in the local atmosphere, and having the flights sorted out in one go? Yes, please! It feels less like a logistical challenge and more like the exciting beginning of an adventure.

""Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/""

I'd probably start by checking out a few different OTA platforms to see what kind of bundles they're offering for my desired dates. I'd definitely compare the package price to booking separately, just to be sure I was getting a good deal. Reading reviews of both the flights and the potential Airbnbs would be non-negotiable. I'd be looking for an Airbnb with a great location, positive reviews about the host and cleanliness, and ideally a little balcony to enjoy a coffee in the morning sun. The convenience factor alone is a huge plus, freeing up my time to research the best past√©is de nata bakeries and figure out the tram system.

Conclusion: The Future is Bundled

1kixrc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kixrc5/helldiver_letter_to_the_devs/,Helldiver Letter to the devs.,"Dear Arrowhead Game Studios,

Lets talk.

As a player since launch and an active community member, Ive watched you navigate launch chaos, server crashes, the Sony account situation, and more. Through all of this, Helldivers 2 has attracted one of the most passionate, roleplay-heavy, and loyal communities Ive ever seen. Ive had random squads address me as ""Cadet"" in character, teach me the ropes, and make every mission feel like a slice of a true Helldiver life. 

That level of organic player buy-in is rare. But it feels like its being underutilized both in terms of player engagement and long-term game health. This letter aims to respectfully outline the missed opportunities and offer actionable ideas to help the game reach its full potential.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Community Engagement & Transparency

First, lets address the Community Manager role. I understand youve had community managers before, and for various reasons, they didnt work out. Regardless of those past challenges, this role is absolutely essential for a live service game to thrive. You need someone actively engaging Reddit, Discord, and YouTube with short updates, developer spotlights, community polls, and playful interaction.

A great model to look at is Coffee Stain Studios, makers of Satisfactory. They are located just a few hours from you by car(I checked). Their community interaction strategy of devlogs, social media engagement, and transparent development discussions created one of the healthiest communities I have ever seen. You have the same opportunity, if not more, given the scale of Helldivers 2's initial success.

Suggested Actions:

Hire a dedicated, empowered Community Manager.

Publish brief dev diaries or spotlight videos (2-5 minutes) featuring your team and what they do. Propose to the community what to ask in each interview. For example, A post on reddit might look like. ""Next week we will be posting an interview with our creative director. We would love to know what kinds of things our community would like to ask him. "" and let that post fill up. You can pick and choose what to actually ask. 

Engage directly with community-made concepts, fan art, and gameplay ideas. I've seen some pretty well made/fleshed out concept art and diagrams for ideas people have. Perhaps have someone chime in and say something like ""We talked about this very idea during pre-production and turned it down due to X Y Z. "" Or if someone makes an exceptional fan art. Buy a print from them and post it in your studio. Seriously. PEOPLE JUST WANT TO FEEL INVOLVED. 

Let players vote on studio-prepared Warbond themes to foster agency and hype. For example. In studio, come up with 4 vague ideas for Warbonds, then propose those ideas to the community. Let them vote and then develop based on those votes. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Gameplay & Content Innovation

The core gameplay loop is fantastic, but new content feels uninspired and slow. Recent Warbonds have added more of the same. A marksman rifles and rehashed armor passives. Helldivers 2 needs content that feels fresh, not iterative.

Weapon & Playstyle Expansions

Add distinct new weapon mechanics: miniguns, shockwave-based crowd control, homing systems, poison effects, gravity rounds, microwave-style thermal weapons, rocket pistols, dual-wielding secondaries like Uzis, more stratagems that are directly player involved like the HMG. 

Make multiple playstyles viable through weapon diversity, armor perks, and stratagem synergies. You've seen 40k yea? We want chainsaws on our swords! Haha. Realistically though, just put some thought into letting people have agency in how close or far away they want to engage enemies. 

Allow chaotic player choice: want four turrets? Two primaries? Let players experiment and push the limits of their loadouts.  Cinema and chaos is what this game is about. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Endgame Progression & Cosmetic Rewards

Once players hit Level 150, progression doesnt exist. Add a prestige or mastery system that lets us chase something beyond just Major Orders and Warbonds because currently, those are the ONLY two things you can accomplish. 

Cosmetic Progression Concept:

Every 10 level. Worth of XP, players can roll for a rare cosmetic (armor pattern, helmet, cape, etc.).

If they dont get it, bank 30% of their progress toward the next roll, reducing frustration and rewarding dedication.

Cosmetic drops could be themed to player performance or faction events for added flavor. Think MMO status where you'll see someone with a special minion or hat or outfit and you're like WHOA ive never seen that before and its because its a super hard thing to get. They have to have 100% accuracy for 3 missions in a row, or flame only for 3 missions in a row. Basically give people achievements with cosmetic rewards. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Universe Building & Lore Engagement

The Helldivers universe is rich with satire and macro-lore, but players want to feel more connected to the micro-level story. Right now we are told to defend planet X Y Z for our MO order. It all feels kind of meaningless because with or without the MO. The overall gameplay doesnt change even a little. Honestly, back in the day when we were like save the children or get mines. That was a meaningful decision. It was GAMEPLAY focused. We need to go back to the defense or attacking of certain planets to earn tangible gameplay focused rewards. 

Suggestions:

Provide zone-based lore (not every planet, but grouped regions) that explains why these areas matter. you lose the area. you lose gameplay mechanics. You gain an area, you gain gameplay mechanics. This is a hard ask and i understand no one wants to lose gameplay choices but it would certainly help change the meta of weapon/strat choice. Plus it would allow inclusion of strategy on the overall map. We push far enough into Terminids territory..we get tanks with flamethrowers or something cool and OP, because its a hard and fun reward to receive. 

Add command briefings featuring live-action or pre-recorded video (think Command & Conquer style) with 2-4 different commanders per front providing orders, context, and flavor. Honestly, as it stands, it feels like it takes too long between missions anyway. Though that might just be loading screens disguised. You come out of the freezer, you go to the map, we have a new MO, cool i get a fun video to watch. This could literally be someone in a helldiver armor cosplay in front of a green screen. It doesnt have to be Super Earth's highest production value. Its all quirky chaos anyway. Thats the point.

If a Major Order fails, have an in-character Helldiver Commander (think Jeff Kaplan in armor) deliver a public address to media or in-game saming us for our failure and rallying us to do better.

Weekly comics, propaganda broadcasts, or news-style updates would further pull players into the war effort and make their actions feel meaningful. Check out ""Gone with the Blastwave"". Its an old online comic that is PERFECT for the helldiver 2 type of universe art. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Live Events, Holidays, and Limited Modes

Seasonal events and limited-time modes are easy wins for engagement. Leverage your in-universe holidays to drive weekly or monthly excitement.

Event Ideas:

Spread Democracy Day . First Monday of every month. Bonus medals, community buffs, and special voice lines.

Obedience Week. Log in daily to earn salute/walk emotes or complete themed challenges.

Unity Day squad-shared health pools or random elite commander roles.

Bug Burndown Bash / Automaton Uprising Day  Faction-specific buffs and temporary stratagem enhancements.

These dont require massive development effort but offer huge player engagement returns.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monetization & Player Trust

At launch, you earned praise for not flooding the game with microtransactions. But we may be in an even worse state where there's no real content at all to earn or buy past what was dropped 3 months ago. Thats worse than microtransactions..arguably. 

You have an opportunity to involve the community directly:

Internally develop 4 Warbond theme concepts and let players vote on their favorite.

This creates hype, makes players feel heard, and ensures content feels player-driven.

 \-------------------------------------------------------



Design Philosophy: Let Players Have Fun

Balance shouldnt come at the cost of fun. Give players the freedom to go wild:

Four machine gun turrets? Let them.

Dual primaries? Go for it.

Overpowered event weekends? Why not.

Players will remember the moments when they felt like unstoppable agents of Democracy more than the times everything felt fair.





 Final Thoughts

Currently, players have two long-term goals: Major Orders and Warbonds. Thats not enough to sustain a live service title. Helldivers 2 is special. It has the player base, the humor, and the raw potential to last for years but only if you double down on community engagement, content innovation, meaningful progression, and universe-building.

Were ready two spread Managed Democracy for years to come. Please give us the tools, the stories, and the connection to make that journey worthwhile.

Thank you for your time and thank you for creating something truly special.

In unity and liberty,

1kixr56,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kixr56/i_did_something_totally_crazy_in_my_car_during_my/,I did something totally crazy in my car during my kids‚Äô library story time,"I‚Äôm late 30s, married, mom of two (6 and 8), and I‚Äôm like the most basic suburban mom ever, you know, minivan, grocery lists, yelling at my kids to brush their teeth. But yesterday, I did something so wild, so freaking dirty in the library parking lot that I‚Äôm still freaking out. It‚Äôs the naughtiest thing I‚Äôve done in forever, and I gotta confess somewhere before I lose it.

So every Wednesday, I take my kids to story time at the library. They‚Äôre obsessed, and I get 45 minutes to chill in my car, sip coffee, and pretend I‚Äôm not just a walking to-do list. Things with my husband have been rough lately. 

He‚Äôs always working late, and our sex life is pretty much dead, like we‚Äôre lucky to have a quickie once a month. I‚Äôve been so frustrated, feeling invisible, and straight-up horny as hell. Yesterday, I was in a mood. I put on a sundress that made me feel kinda sexy for once, not just mom-level functional, and I was already antsy when I parked in the lot.

I was alone in my car, windows up, parked in a quiet shady corner of the lot. The kids were inside, safe with the librarian, and I had my coffee and phone. I started scrolling, and somehow, don‚Äôt ask me how, I ended up on this spicy romance novel app I downloaded on a whim. 

The story I was reading was super steamy, all about forbidden passion and secret hookups, and before I knew it, I was squirming, my skin all tingly. I could feel myself getting so wet, and with nobody around, I was like, screw it, why not?

I checked the lot, it was empty, just a few cars parked way off, and I slid my hand under my sundress. My heart was going crazy, like I was breaking some major rule, but the thrill of doing something this bad in such a normal place was intense.

I started touching myself, slow at first, imagining I was the woman in the story, getting swept away by some hot stranger. My fingers slipped under my panties, and God, I was so turned on it was almost embarrassing. I leaned the seat back a bit, spread my legs, and just went for it, rubbing exactly how I like, my breath all shaky as I pictured someone catching me, wanting me.

I was so into it, eyes half-closed, one hand on myself, the other gripping the steering wheel, that I didn‚Äôt even notice this mom walking to her car nearby. I was literally seconds from coming when I heard her car door slam. 

My eyes snapped open, and there she was, like 20 feet away, buckling her kid into a car seat. I yanked my hand out, pulled my dress down, and sat up so fast I spilled my coffee everywhere. I was all flushed and panting, praying she didn‚Äôt look over and see me looking like a total mess. She didn‚Äôt, thank God, she just drove off, but the adrenaline of almost getting caught made my whole body buzz even more.

I didn‚Äôt finish, story time was almost done, and I had to pull myself together to grab my kids. I walked into the library, smiling like a normal mom, while my underwear was soaked and my brain was still stuck in dirty mode. I got the kids home, made dinner, acted fine, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. 

The way it felt to be so reckless, so alive, in my dumb mom-mobile. I feel like a crappy wife, my husband doesn‚Äôt deserve this, but I also feel like I grabbed back some piece of myself that‚Äôs been lost under dishes and carpools.

I‚Äôm already dreading, or maybe kinda excited for, next Wednesday. What if I park in that same spot? What if I‚Äôm bolder? Am I losing my mind? Is this a midlife crisis or what? And, okay, guys, if you saw a mom doing this in her car, would you be shocked or kinda into it? I‚Äôm a total mess right now.

**Timeline:**¬†

* 4/22 ‚Äì Inquired about the bag and asked for specifically from the HC factory. Confirmed he can source it and paid.¬†
* 4/24 ‚Äì Jimmy sent me the PSPs, but he ended up ordering the wrong bag (he ordered the MM size instead of this PM), so he returned it and reordered the correct bag. ¬†
* 4/25 ‚Äì Jimmy sent me the PSPs for the correct bag. I greenlighted it. He shipped same day.¬†
* 4/28 ‚Äì Jimmy sent me tracking number¬†
* 5/6 ‚Äì Received package¬†

**Thoughts about the bag:** Alright, listen up all bag lovers! The LV Carryall PM in Monogram Denim has officially become my go-to everyday bag and I am obsessed.¬†It‚Äôs the perfect mix of casual and chic that fits right into my sports mom life without looking like I‚Äôm trying too hard. The monogram denim has a laid-back vibe but still looks polished enough to take anywhere. Whether I‚Äôm racing to practice, running errands, or passing out snacks like a pro, this bag just works.¬†The roomy interior holds all my essentials‚Äîphone, wallet, keys, snacks for the endlessly hungry kids, and even a water bottle. That mini pouch inside? Total lifesaver for stashing my lady essentials.¬†The adjustable strap is amazing. Crossbody keeps me hands-free while juggling gear and coffee, while the shoulder option gives it a more effortless feel. The gold-tone hardware adds just the right touch of LV glam without being too flashy.¬†I‚Äôll be honest. I didn‚Äôt even think I liked denim bags before I met the CC25 black denim. I thought styling would be a struggle but wow, was I wrong. The color is shockingly neutral, goes with everything, and is absolutely perfect for summer.¬†

Final verdict? Total win. This bag fits my busy life perfectly and I loooooove it.¬†

**Thoughts about the factory:** Okay, confession time. I had absolutely zero clue about this Carryall Denim before I saw it on IG, but the moment I did, I knew it had to be mine. I originally planned to grab it from God Factory, but they‚Äôve been sold out for weeks and I'm an impulse buyer so I could not wait. Soooooo I had to rethink my strategy. Cue my deep dive into other factories. After some serious bag stalking, I landed on HC Factory. I didn‚Äôt know anything about them, but their denim was the closest match to the auth I could find. Every other option was either way too blue or not distressed enough, and I just couldn‚Äôt settle for anything less than ""perfection"". Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even care if they weren't ""high tier"". I wanted this bag so bad that I was willing to roll the dice. And guess what? It is actually a solid bag. The denim feels nice, looks gorgeous, the hardware is the right tone of gold and it is solid! The engravings are all nice and clean. The treated leather is great too! So, I have zero regrets about adding it to my collection. Sometimes, impulse decisions turn out to be the best ones!¬†If you're not trying to break the bank, but want this bag, this factory would be a good option!

**Thoughts about the seller:** I bought this bag from Jimmy (again) because duh, I need that shipping peace of mind. He covers 100% if anything gets seized and with the de minimis exemption being kaput, I wanted that extra protection. No way am I letting customs snatch my bag without a backup plan. One thing I don't like to do is waste my hard earned mula. So yeah, Jimmy will continue to be my go-to for bags. His QC isn‚Äôt perfect, but I know enough to go full detective mode on the PSPs and ask for extra pics and videos. As long as I do my own thorough check, I feel good about it. Jimmy has been amazing to me and honestly, shopping with him just feels safe and easy. That kind of reliability is hard to beat.¬†

Now, what‚Äôs the next bag I should obsess over?¬†¬†",5,1746837269.0,OGRepladies,4,1.0,False

On April 14th, 2025, he came up to my friend at the U of A Student Union Building (SUB) and dumped an entire melted Iced Cap directly onto her lap and laptop which destroyed her computer during finals. We are unsure of whether it was a hate crime or a random attack. 

The police told her that this man slept for 10 hours straight on the SUB staircase then woke up and dumped the coffee on her. 

This is also a warning to anyone else who may encounter him that he may be a dangerous individual or potentially cause harm. From her interaction with him he seemed irrational.

The police are choosing to not press charges because she was sitting in a blind spot in the video footage and therefore it does not show him pouring the coffee on her. They claim there is insufficient evidence to prove intent. The police did not come to the scene, only campus peace officers.

Tomtom‚Äôs little voice pulled me from sleep. 
He was sitting right in front of my face, perched on my pillow, his tiny head tilted to the side as I opened my eyes and yawned. 
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I mumbled, yawning again. 
I reached for my phone. 7:45. 
Oh shit. I work today. And I start at 8:30. 
I jumped out of bed and got ready in five minutes. I then brushed my teeth and grabbed my keys. 
‚ÄúFuck it, I‚Äôll get lunch at the cafeteria,‚Äù I said, giving Tomtom a quick kiss on the head before rushing out the door and locking it tight. 
Nobody‚Äôs taking my stuff. No way! I might not be rolling in cash, but damn it, I enjoy what I have. 
My apartment? It‚Äôs just a one-bedroom, sure, but it‚Äôs warm, it‚Äôs mine. And that bathroom is huge, with both a tub and a shower? Pure luxury. 
The kitchen flows right into the living room, with a killer island standing proudly between them. 
The moment I saw it online, I knew. The very next day, I made it mine. 
 
Living close to work has its perks. I always bump into coworkers or sweet old folks on my way out. It‚Äôs not downtown. It‚Äôs quiet. Like the world slows down a little around here. 
I hopped into my car, hair still loose, and drove to work. 
 
8:05. Parked. Out. Running to the doors, taking the stairs four floors up‚Äîbecause hey, cardio, right? 
Maybe I should start running again. Might help next time I‚Äôm late. 
 
8:11. Made it. Finally. 
Sonia smiled as I walked toward my station, twisting my hair into a low bun. 
‚ÄúRough morning?‚Äù she asked. 
‚ÄúYeah. Yesterday was a lot‚Ä¶‚Äù 
‚ÄúOh right. I‚Äôm so sorry about Gigi. She was truly an angel.‚Äù 
I smiled a little. 
It‚Äôs still strange remembering that my grandmother used to be a nurse here too. Same hospital. So many people knew her, and loved her. That woman had a heart bigger than this entire place. 
I took a deep breath as I sat down. 
‚ÄúOkay, you got this,‚Äù I murmured to myself, grabbing my gear and shifting into nurse mode. 
 
The end of my shift came slowly. I looked at the clock so many times I forgot how to count. Hopefully, the coffee machine was always ready with some fresh one. I feel as if the day was long for everybody with this virus going around. The silent killer.  
 
8:30 p.m. Finally. I zipped up my bag, grabbed my water bottle, and shrugged on my coat. The rain had started just as I picked up my lunch at the cafeteria. 
‚ÄúShit,‚Äù I muttered under my breath. I had planned to take a walk to the park around the corner. Just to clear my head. But I guess it‚Äôs going to be Netflix and no chill... alone. 
 
As I walked toward the stairs, I slowed. A flash of last Sunday at the club hit me like a jolt: him. That man. His presence. Heavy, magnetic. 
I shook my head, forcing the image out, and kept going down the stairs until I hit the exit door. 
The air was thick. That warm scent of rain and thunder hung around me. I‚Äôve always liked that smell. Comforting, in a weird way. 
I tugged my hood up, glanced both ways, then dashed across the road toward the parking lot. I always leave my car in the lot behind the hospital. ‚ÄúWell, I guess that‚Äôs the only run I‚Äôm getting today‚Ä¶ aside from dodging every damn call light going off at once.‚Äù 
I reached my car. 
Fuck. I didn‚Äôt lock it. 
There were some flyers tucked into the window, but everything else looked untouched. 
‚ÄúOuf,‚Äù I exhaled, relieved. 
I slid in, started the engine, and drove straight home as the thunder cracked through the sky behind me. 
 
I stepped out of the shower just as a streak of lightning split the sky. 
My hair clung to my shoulders, damp and heavy, and I wrapped a towel around my chest, letting it fall just beneath my ass. Warm steam still clung to the air. I wiped a circle on the fogged-up mirror, barely recognizing the glint in my own eyes. 
 
I‚Äôd forgotten to turn on the fan. 
With a breath, I walked over to the small window by my vanity and cracked it open. 
A rush of cool wind swept in, brushing rain against my cheeks. That scent again: wet leaves, thunder, spring heat. It poured into my lungs like nostalgia. 
I was lucky to have that window. Hidden behind a thick tree, it gave me just enough privacy to skip the curtain. I wasn‚Äôt shy about my body, it was mine, my temple. But it was his, too. At least‚Ä¶ I wanted it to be. 
I bit my lower lip, the thought of him curling warm in my stomach. His hands. His eyes. His presence. 
‚ÄúMeow.‚Äù 
The soft sound pulled me out of my head. 
I turned, smiling. ‚ÄúOh, yes‚Ä¶ hungry, little man?‚Äù 
He rubbed against my legs as I walked to the kitchen, grabbed his food, and filled the bowl. 
A happy chirp from him made me laugh quietly. Damn, cat had better timing than most men. 
I padded back to the bathroom, towel loose, and dried off. 
Black panties. Oversized band tee, faded and stretched, sliding over my skin like a second whisper. 
The wind moaned through the cracked window. 
And I still tasted him in my thoughts. 
 
 
You, the Netflix series, had just dropped a new season. And damn, I liked it. Dark. Twisted. Intimate in a dangerous way. Something about stalking, obsession, and desire all tangled up in one. It made me wish‚Ä¶ I was in it. Living something insane, dramatic. Dangerous. 
Then I remembered‚Ä¶ they all mostly end up dead. 
‚ÄúNot a good idea,‚Äù I muttered and shoved another handful of popcorn into my mouth. 
 
Tomtom was curled beside me, snoring like he paid rent. 
The episode ended, and I clicked off the TV. Quiet settled in. 
 
I grabbed my phone and checked my messages. 
Spencer: You working tomorrow? 
Me: Yeah. Five days in a row. 
Spencer: Alright. Friday night at the club then? 
I smirked. Sweet little preschool teacher by day and, full-blown party animal by night. 
Me: Sounds good! GN! 
 
I locked the convo and opened the app. That app. 
The first video: some cute family dancing in pajamas. Swipe. 
Another: a puppy tangled in a blanket. Swipe. 
Then I heard it. 
A sound. 
That sound. 
I blinked and brought the volume up. Tomtom groaned beside me. 
‚ÄúGo back to sleep, you,‚Äù I whispered, petting his head without looking. 
The video. 
A man. Masked. Singing. 
His voice, no, growling, soft and raw all at once. Like someone dragging a velvet knife across my spine. His hand held the mic like it was holy. His jawline, hidden by a beard, was sharp and shadowed. His presence? Unholy. 
I leaned in. 
‚ÄúIs this new?‚Äù I whispered, goosebumps rising on my thighs. 
I tapped into the band‚Äôs page. There was barely anything there. Just a few photos, and a couple of reels. 
The latest one. I clicked. 
Same man. 
Same mask. 
The same voice that pulled something low in my belly, dark and aching. 
‚ÄúHow can a song do that to me?‚Äù I asked out loud. 
Tomtom meowed, pissed at the volume spike. 
I barely noticed. I had already started to fall into that voice. 
 
A few hours later, I woke up. Eyes half closed, I looked at my hands, still holding my phone. It was still open, so I glanced at the time. Damn. It was already 1 a.m. I got up to go to bed, still floating through a dream.

We are such a strong team together and our managers love when the three of us work together because we beat any rush like it's nothing. I share common interests with Evelyn and I share a sense or humor with Tatiana.

Recently, I've noticed that Evelyn has been making really passive aggressive comments towards me. Me and Evelyn have always joked around and have been working together for most of the time so I don't know where this all came from. Today, Tatiana arrived at work and we both started joking around. She said something funny and I laughed while walking towards Evelyn. Evelyn then made a face at me and she said, ""OP you are SO ugly...like you're actually so ugly."" That took me by surprise because I really and truly don't know where that came from. 

I don't consider myself pretty but I am also not ugly, I have a boyfriend and we have been dating for a year now so I really don't think I'm that ugly. I didn't know what to say and like I said, it just took me by surprise. I just said, ""Well, people say we look alike so you must be ugly too."" And she just kept repeating herself. 

This week Tuesday me and her hung out too and I said, ""Those tacos are calling my name, I'm so hungry,"" when I saw a taco truck and she proceeded to call me fat. I have opened to her about my past eating disorder and struggles with food so I didn't know what to say at that time. She herself has also dealt with this so I don't know why she would say that. I promise you guys that I would recognize if I had done something to her for her to tell me these things, but I really have not. I don't want the work ambience to be awkward between me and her so I don't know what to do.

I texted Tatiana to call me when her shift ends and I'm going to tell her all of this. She has also had some problems with Evelyn in the past but it was because of some other stuff. I'll update if you guys want after we have the conversation. 

Would I be TAH if I distance myself? Thank you for reading.",1,1746836683.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

Of course, officially I‚Äôm known as a ‚Äúparanormal investigator,‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt think any of that stuff was real for a while. It‚Äôs hard to believe that stuff when 90% of the cases I investigate just turn out to be some elderly couple without a carbon monoxide detector. That was until June 12, 2022, when I was hired by the Grotto family to investigate why they had randomly switched bodies.

On that fateful day, I was investigating a dinky old field hospital in London. I had been hired by a ghost hunting show the BBC was producing, and they wanted me to come on, take some readings, walk around, and overreact at extremely normal temperature changes. I was

I was taking a quick lunch break with the rest of the crew when I got a call. I stepped out a moment and took the call. A throaty voice began to speak.

‚ÄùI am Duncan Grotto, and I could really use your readings and stuff, I guess. Name your price,‚Äù he said. I could tell from his way of speaking that this guy was nowhere near the level of fanciness his name would imply.

‚ÄùWell, could you let me know when you want me to come? I kind of have a busy schedule,‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄùI said, name your price.‚Äù

‚Äú10 million dollars,‚Äù I said jokingly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll lower that price if you give me the courtesy of‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄùSounds good,‚Äù he interrupted. ‚ÄúCome next week, investigate what we‚Äôre asking, and you‚Äôll get the money you‚Äôre asking for. 5 million dollars up front, 5 million dollars after the job is done. I‚Äôll email you the finer details.‚Äù He then hung up the phone.

I was getting suspicious, so I looked up this guy. He was definitely serious. His family had a net worth in the billions. They had a giant estate in Vermont and had large investments in Pepsi, McDonald's, Hollywood, and other things. The guy who called me, Duncan, was an investment banker. His wife, Molly, was an astronomer. They had no kids. It was hard to focus on filming for the rest of the day knowing that 10 million dollars next week. As soon as I got to my hotel, I checked my email. Sure enough, I had an email from Duncan listing the address and details. What caught my attention was their reasons for contacting me; it was unlike anything I had ever seen. According to them, they didn‚Äôt exist. They had previously existed as a young couple in Texas that was fresh out of college. And one day, they just woke up in the bodies of this rich couple. According to them, no one seemed to believe anything weird was going on. Even after telling their supposed friends what was going on many times, having multiple public breakdowns, and begging their friends to believe them, they did not act any different. They always forgot about the incidents the next day.

When I arrived at the estate, I almost gasped at how large it was. It was rustic and made of dark oak wood. It was a good 5 stories tall and was separated into 3 buildings. There was stained glass dotting the outside and a large stable in the back. The areas around the building were incredibly overgrown. The roof of every building was a marble dome. Engraved in golden letters above the entryway to the house was the name ‚ÄúGrotto.‚Äù What caught the eye the most was a giant tower jutting out from the largest building like a tooth. I assumed it was some sort of observatory. I grabbed my bag of equipment.

When I got in, Duncan, if that was his real name, was pacing around. Molly was staring off into space. As soon as he saw me, Duncan handed me a check for 5 million dollars without saying a word. I was taken aback by the fact that he gave me a check. I assumed that amount of money would require something else, but I guessed he wasn‚Äôt used to giving that, and money is money.

‚ÄúSo, have you noticed anything strange besides the whole not-existing thing?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThere was one thing we noticed,‚Äù said Molly. I looked at her intently. She gestured for me to follow her. I followed her past the flower-cutting room, the shoe-shining room, the washing machine room, the dryer room, the coffee-making room, the bowling alley, and the basketball court. My thoughts of how stupidly rich this couple must have been was interrupted by Molly. ‚ÄúWe occasionally hear loud footsteps, usually lasting 5 minutes. Whenever we investigate, we hear them coming from behind this wall, even though there‚Äôs no room there.‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúBy the way, have you gone to a therapist lately?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúPlease just do the thing we hired you to do,‚Äù

‚ÄùJust making small talk while I do my work. Anyway, have either of you been in any sort of motor accident?‚Äú

‚ÄùShut up or we won‚Äôt give you the other 5,‚Äù That got me to stop talking real fast.

Before I became a scam artist, I was a carpenter. I may have hated it, but I did retain a decent amount of skills from that job. The main skill is being able to analyze wood. Which has rarely been helpful. However, when I knocked on that hallway and realized that it was hollow, I was

I'm glad I had spent 5 years breathing in mold. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely a room or space in there,‚Äù I said. Duncan nodded. Without saying a word, he walked over, firmly planted his feet, and kicked the wall over and over and over again. until it crumbled. It honestly scared me a bit. I cautiously walked over to the pulverized section of the hall and saw a yellow door with. I opened it and found a long, dark hallway. I grabbed my flashlight and ventured in.

Step, step, step. The floor seemed to creak with every step I took. Step, step, step. It felt like someone was watching me, but I ignored it. Step, step, step. The feeling of being watched continued to grow and grow until it was near impossible to ignore. I looked back and saw

Duncan and Molly were waiting at the entrance. Step, step, step. I could‚Äôve sworn I was hearing faint breathing sounds from the room. Step, step, step, step. That last step wasn‚Äôt mine. The flashlight barely illuminated a room at the end. I heard a rustling from inside the room.

I quickly started backpedaling.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone in there,‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, what are we paying you for? Go in there,‚Äù said Molly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you,‚Äù offered Duncan, brandishing a Swiss Army knife. I nodded. Together we walked all the way to the end of the hallway and saw not a person, but a mirror.

It was a very fancy, rich person's mirror. It had what looked like real jewels in the corner and had a frame made of dark oak wood. Carved into the wood was the word ‚Äúevanescent.‚Äù I later learned that it was the Latin word for disappear. ‚ÄúWe have a similar mirror in the observatory,‚Äù said Duncan. Covering the entire room was 1 continuous strip of paper that must have been hundreds of feet long. I examined it and saw that the same latin word was written over and over again. Beneath the strip was a thick layer of ash that covered the floor. I shoved the strip to the side and examined the ash more thoroughly. That was when I noticed something.

In the reflection there appeared to be footprints in the ash, while there weren‚Äôt in real life. That was when I saw a new footprint appear in the

reflection that wasn‚Äôt there. I jumped back. Duncan seemed to have noticed it too because he seemed frantic. I looked at the mirror.

and saw a handprint appear on it. But it wasn‚Äôt in the real world; it seemed to be on the other side of the mirror, as if the mirror was a window. Without thinking, I grabbed some random tool from my bag and hurled it at the mirror. The tool went through the mirror and hit some invisible man. For a brief second, I saw a person in the mirror. He looked exactly the same as Duncan. Then he disappeared. I ran to the mirror and punched it. My hand went through and punched the invisible man again. I felt his skin against my knuckle and heard his cry of pain. The invisible man snarled. I felt something pulling at my arm. I swung wildly, but it wasn‚Äôt the invisible man who was pulling me; it was something else. The mirror began to crack. I blacked out.

‚Ä¶

When I woke up, I was in the living room of the house. I was half convinced I had hallucinated the whole thing. I heard Duncan and Molly talking from the other room. I rushed over there, but I couldn‚Äôt see them; I could only hear them. Not only that, but while it was their voices, I couldn‚Äôt understand them at all. It was like they were speaking a different language. I looked in the mirror on my left and saw them on the other side. They didn‚Äôt react to me at all. I had been dragged into this weird mirror world. I went over the events that took place before I blacked out over and over again. If I were in the same mirror place as the invisible man I threw hands with, maybe I could find him. If he brought me here, maybe he could put me back. The first place I checked was the secret room, but the mirror had completely shattered. The weird thing was, the one continuous strip of paper had been replaced with a large chain. Also, there was something blocking the door, it was like someone had put it there to keep Molly and Duncan out. I remembered Duncan‚Äôs comment about the same mirror being in the observatory and thought that was a good place to check. It took me a while of wandering the halls before I found it.

It was on the other side of a bedroom. The bedroom was large with a bed twice the size of mine and a flatscreen TV. There was a mirror on one side of the bed and a dresser on the other. The TV was turned on to some kind of infomercial. In the infomercial, no one had a face. They were moving stiffly like mannequins, and what sounded like a text-to-speech bot was repeating the phrase ‚Äúbuy now.‚Äù The things were

gesturing to and waving around an empty water bottle, as if they were trying to sell it. A phone number flashed on the screen. It was [000-000-0000](tel:000-000-0000). I rushed over to the mirror and tilted it so the TV was in frame. In the real world, the infomercial was completely normal. Then, it ended, and an episode of Jeopardy came on. I looked back to my world‚Äôs TV and saw that the questions were extremely basic. Stuff like ‚ÄúHow many hearts do people have?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is blinking?‚Äù No one had any face, and when they clicked the buzzer, they wouldn‚Äôt answer the question. Their dollar amount would just change to something completely random, and then they‚Äôd move on. None of the contestants were moving at all. It looked normal in the mirror. I flipped through the channels of that TV for a while, unable to believe what I was seeing. A Shark Tank episode where a faceless person pretended to pitch the wheel, a sitcom that was just a still image of a faceless person put to a looping laugh track, and a documentary that was a text-to-speech bot talking about fingernails. I was freaked out by this, so I rushed over to the observatory. I was going to get out of this weird parody world. When I walked into the observatory, my suspicions were confirmed. 2 people who looked exactly like Duncan and Molly were staring at an ornate mirror. There was a large dome that allowed sunlight to flood into the room. There were bookshelves covering every wall, as well as maps and charts. A large telescope was mounted in the middle of the room. On

On the other side of the mirror, Molly and Duncan were pacing and hyperventilating. As soon as I crossed into the room, they snapped their heads toward me like dolls. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äú I asked. The man furrowed his brow and reached for his pocket. I immediately ripped the telescope off the pedestal and hit the man on the head with it. He stumbled back and dropped the steak knife he was grabbing. I used the telescope like a battering ram and hit him square in the chest. He was knocked back a good 2 feet and went through the mirror. As soon as he did, the Duncan in the real world disappeared.

The woman lunged for the steak knife on the ground. She grabbed it, and I hopped back into the mirror. But unlike the man, I didn‚Äôt go through it. I hit my elbow hard, and the woman began running at me. Just before she stabbed me, I jumped to the side, grabbed the telescope, and knocked her into the mirror. Molly disappeared too. The man yelled in what seemed like frustration. ‚ÄúHow are we going to get back?‚Äù muttered the woman. ‚ÄúWhy do you even want to go back here? It sucks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBeats jail,‚Äù muttered the man. ‚ÄúWoah, woah, woah, slow down a bit. What do you mean, jail‚Äù? The woman gave the man a nasty look.

‚ÄúOkay, listen. I need you to help me out of here. I‚Äôll do anything.‚Äù

The woman raised her eyebrow. ‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù she asked. I nodded furiously. ‚ÄúYou see, the Duncan and Molly you knew are now back in their bodies. The reason we could go back but you can‚Äôt is because we planned for us to come back when we did the ritual. However, when we did the ritual on you, we wanted to chain you into this world, then kill you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why there were chains around the mirror instead of paper,‚Äù I said. The man nodded.

‚ÄúWe were going to come back once the 2 went to jail for our murders and then died. That way no one could come looking for this. If you offer to take over his body and go to jail, then you‚Äôll get out of the mirror world, and when we step back into this world, you‚Äôll go back to your original

body as if nothing ever happened. I‚Äôll use our maid for myself. While we could do the ritual in a way that just picks 2 connected people from anywhere in the world to replace us, that takes a lot longer and a lot more energy,‚Äù said the woman.

So my options were to help murderers roam free or be stuck in a weird mirror dimension. I was only 33, and I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to waste the 50 years of my life I had left to do the right thing. But could I really handle the guilt of being the reason 2 murderers were roaming

the streets. But they probably weren‚Äôt going to try any murders. But they would still escape justice. Accepting the deal was definitely the morally worse option, but it did tempt me. They both looked like they only had a couple of years left in them. I had to decide quickly before they ran out. of patience. I finally said, ‚ÄúI accept.‚Äù They nodded.

‚ÄúOkay, now knock yourself out with that telescope,‚Äù It seemed like a bad idea, but they were my only hope of escaping, and there would be no reason to waste time explaining if they were lying to me. I tentatively reached for the telescope. I took a deep breath, then Hit myself with it.

‚Ä¶

My memories of the next few years are foggy at best. Mostly just isolated incidents of getting beat up by other criminals or guards being nice. I died of a stroke in 2022 and immediately returned to my body, which materialized in my apartment building. It took a lot of explaining about why I was missing; I‚Äôm pretty sure the police questioned me regularly for half a year. I successfully ignored the choice I had made. At least until Duncan and Molly Grotto were found a year later and convicted of murdering someone only 2 months after I had returned to my body.

‚Ä¶

So why am I posting this? I want closure. I want some relief from the guilt that eats at me every night. I‚Äôve seen photos of the victim who was murders, and I see him everywhere. In the mirror, in the faces of other people, and in my dreams. Judge me or don‚Äôt; I couldn‚Äôt care less. I just want closure.",3,1746836442.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

When I woke up, I was in the living room of the house. I was half convinced I had hallucinated the whole thing. I heard Duncan and Molly talking from the other room. I rushed over there, but I couldn‚Äôt see them; I could only hear them. Not only that, but while it was their voices, I couldn‚Äôt understand them at all. It was like they were speaking a different language. I looked in the mirror on my left and saw them on the other side. They didn‚Äôt react to me at all. I had been dragged into this weird mirror world. I went over the events that took place before I blacked out over and over again. If I were in the same mirror place as the invisible man I threw hands with, maybe I could find him. If he brought me here, maybe he could put me back. The first place I checked was the secret room, but the mirror had completely shattered. The weird thing was, the one continuous strip of paper had been replaced with a large chain. Also, there was something blocking the door, it was like someone had put it there to keep Molly and Duncan out. I remembered Duncan‚Äôs comment about the same mirror being in the observatory and thought that was a good place to check. It took me a while of wandering the halls before I found it.

It was on the other side of a bedroom. The bedroom was large with a bed twice the size of mine and a flatscreen TV. There was a mirror on one side of the bed and a dresser on the other. The TV was turned on to some kind of infomercial. In the infomercial, no one had a face. They were moving stiffly like mannequins, and what sounded like a text-to-speech bot was repeating the phrase ‚Äúbuy now.‚Äù The things were

gesturing to and waving around an empty water bottle, as if they were trying to sell it. A phone number flashed on the screen. It was [000-000-0000](tel:000-000-0000). I rushed over to the mirror and tilted it so the TV was in frame. In the real world, the infomercial was completely normal. Then, it ended, and an episode of Jeopardy came on. I looked back to my world‚Äôs TV and saw that the questions were extremely basic. Stuff like ‚ÄúHow many hearts do people have?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is blinking?‚Äù No one had any face, and when they clicked the buzzer, they wouldn‚Äôt answer the question. Their dollar amount would just change to something completely random, and then they‚Äôd move on. None of the contestants were moving at all. It looked normal in the mirror. I flipped through the channels of that TV for a while, unable to believe what I was seeing. A Shark Tank episode where a faceless person pretended to pitch the wheel, a sitcom that was just a still image of a faceless person put to a looping laugh track, and a documentary that was a text-to-speech bot talking about fingernails. I was freaked out by this, so I rushed over to the observatory. I was going to get out of this weird parody world. When I walked into the observatory, my suspicions were confirmed. 2 people who looked exactly like Duncan and Molly were staring at an ornate mirror. There was a large dome that allowed sunlight to flood into the room. There were bookshelves covering every wall, as well as maps and charts. A large telescope was mounted in the middle of the room. On

On the other side of the mirror, Molly and Duncan were pacing and hyperventilating. As soon as I crossed into the room, they snapped their heads toward me like dolls. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äú I asked. The man furrowed his brow and reached for his pocket. I immediately ripped the telescope off the pedestal and hit the man on the head with it. He stumbled back and dropped the steak knife he was grabbing. I used the telescope like a battering ram and hit him square in the chest. He was knocked back a good 2 feet and went through the mirror. As soon as he did, the Duncan in the real world disappeared.

The woman lunged for the steak knife on the ground. She grabbed it, and I hopped back into the mirror. But unlike the man, I didn‚Äôt go through it. I hit my elbow hard, and the woman began running at me. Just before she stabbed me, I jumped to the side, grabbed the telescope, and knocked her into the mirror. Molly disappeared too. The man yelled in what seemed like frustration. ‚ÄúHow are we going to get back?‚Äù muttered the woman. ‚ÄúWhy do you even want to go back here? It sucks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBeats jail,‚Äù muttered the man. ‚ÄúWoah, woah, woah, slow down a bit. What do you mean, jail‚Äù? The woman gave the man a nasty look.

‚ÄúOkay, listen. I need you to help me out of here. I‚Äôll do anything.‚Äù

The woman raised her eyebrow. ‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù she asked. I nodded furiously. ‚ÄúYou see, the Duncan and Molly you knew are now back in their bodies. The reason we could go back but you can‚Äôt is because we planned for us to come back when we did the ritual. However, when we did the ritual on you, we wanted to chain you into this world, then kill you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why there were chains around the mirror instead of paper,‚Äù I said. The man nodded.

‚ÄúWe were going to come back once the 2 went to jail for our murders and then died. That way no one could come looking for this. If you offer to take over his body and go to jail, then you‚Äôll get out of the mirror world, and when we step back into this world, you‚Äôll go back to your original

body as if nothing ever happened. I‚Äôll use our maid for myself. While we could do the ritual in a way that just picks 2 connected people from anywhere in the world to replace us, that takes a lot longer and a lot more energy,‚Äù said the woman.

So my options were to help murderers roam free or be stuck in a weird mirror dimension. I was only 33, and I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to waste the 50 years of my life I had left to do the right thing. But could I really handle the guilt of being the reason 2 murderers were roaming

the streets. But they probably weren‚Äôt going to try any murders. But they would still escape justice. Accepting the deal was definitely the morally worse option, but it did tempt me. They both looked like they only had a couple of years left in them. I had to decide quickly before they ran out. of patience. I finally said, ‚ÄúI accept.‚Äù They nodded.

‚ÄúOkay, now knock yourself out with that telescope,‚Äù It seemed like a bad idea, but they were my only hope of escaping, and there would be no reason to waste time explaining if they were lying to me. I tentatively reached for the telescope. I took a deep breath, then Hit myself with it.

‚Ä¶

My memories of the next few years are foggy at best. Mostly just isolated incidents of getting beat up by other criminals or guards being nice. I died of a stroke in 2022 and immediately returned to my body, which materialized in my apartment building. It took a lot of explaining about why I was missing; I‚Äôm pretty sure the police questioned me regularly for half a year. I successfully ignored the choice I had made. At least until Duncan and Molly Grotto were found a year later and convicted of murdering someone only 2 months after I had returned to my body.

‚Ä¶

So why am I posting this? I want closure. I want some relief from the guilt that eats at me every night. I‚Äôve seen photos of the victim who was murders, and I see him everywhere. In the mirror, in the faces of other people, and in my dreams. Judge me or don‚Äôt; I couldn‚Äôt care less. I just want closure.",3,1746836193.0,nosleep,0,0.8,False

1kixb58,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_azulaiskween/comments/1kixb58/tepache/,Tepache,"As someone new to fermentation, I have learned a great deal from my unsuccessful attempts. It's fascinating how many factors come into play, especially for beginners. While following a recipe closely is important, it's the journey of trial and error that ultimately leads to mastery and builds confidence in any hobby.

**Things to consider:**

**1. Quality of Water.** If you are unsure about the minerals added to your tap water (especially if you drink it directly), it's best to stick with filtered or bottled water. I tried boiling my water to eliminate chlorine, and while I noticed some small bubbles in my ginger bug and other ferments, they eventually died out. As a result, I ended up with no carbonation in the airtight bottles I purchased specifically for this process. Trust me, boiling water can remove chlorine, but some minerals will not evaporate. **DO NOT ADD BOILING WATER TO YOUR FRUIT**. Doing so will kill the yeast. This may seem obvious, but many people overlook it. For example, people often pour boiling water over instant coffee and then wonder why it tastes bad. Instead, dissolve instant coffee in cold water before adding hot water.

**2. Type of Sugar.** You can use white sugar if you want, but your ferment is going to take longer compared to raw sugar because white sugar is more processed. Brown sugar is the best because it has molasses. You can also buy a bottle of molasses and add it to your white sugar, it's going to work just fine. I saw **IMMEDIATE** BUBBLES and gases when I used brown sugar compared to white sugar.

**3. Be Patient & Pay Attention.** You have to make sure you let the ferment do its thing. If you're busy and not gonna be around a lot, make sure you submerge your fruit under glass weights or else it'll grow mold. If you're going to be around a lot, you don't need to get the weights. Just make sure you stir everything every 4-6 hours to prevent mold. Make sure when you stir, you make a roaring whirlpool in your jar. **STERILIZE EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.**

**4. Measurements & Food**. Overfeeding your ferment can be detrimental. For every 1 cup of fruit, use 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of water. If you have 2 cups of fruit, that means you'll need 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of water. It's important that the volume of water matches the amount of fruit you have, but you can adjust it to your preference if desired. I recommend mixing the sugar with the fruit and letting it sit for 25-35 minutes. This helps to extract a significant amount of flavor before adding the water. Some people believe they can achieve the same flavor by adding everything to the jar all at once, but that‚Äôs not the case. Just like in cooking, different ingredients have different cooking times. For instance, garlic and carrots cook at different rates, even if they are in the same stir-fry.",1,1746836017.0,u_azulaiskween,0,1.0,False

The first few hours of being Pope didn‚Äôt feel like divine intervention. They felt more like the sick joke of an overworked cafeteria worker who couldn‚Äôt escape the nightmare of too many orders and too little patience.

‚ÄúHoly grounds, my ass,‚Äù Theo muttered again, more to himself than anyone in the room, as the Vatican‚Äôs officials flanked him with eager smiles and forced reverence.

He looked at his reflection in the giant gold-framed mirror hanging above him.

There he was, the Pope‚Äîa kid from Brooklyn with a bad attitude, too many cigarettes in his lungs, and a love for low-brow humor. His fingers fumbled with the too-tight papal tiara, feeling like an amateur at a masquerade ball that he had never been invited to.

‚ÄúYour Holiness, welcome,‚Äù Cardinal Mancini said, his voice dripping with that syrupy reverence that only centuries of indoctrination could create. His eyes practically sparkled, but they had that dark, knowing gleam of a man who had seen too many others sit where Theo was now.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù Theo said, looking at him like the guy just told him the Earth was flat. ‚ÄúReal glad to be here, pal. Could you, like, take this damn crown off me? It‚Äôs too tight, and it smells like someone‚Äôs been wearing it while sacrificing goats.‚Äù

The cardinal didn‚Äôt laugh.

Theo rolled his eyes. He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the heat, the exhaustion, or the weird, inexplicable sense of disbelief that made him feel like he was trapped in a fever dream. Probably all three.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for holiness. I asked for hot coffee, rent forgiveness, and a moment of silence that didn‚Äôt smell like incense and guilt.‚Äù

He glanced around the room. There were no holy visions, no angels, no dramatic lightning strikes from the sky‚Äîjust a bunch of old men in robes who looked like they were about to explode from all the secrets they‚Äôd been keeping for centuries.

‚ÄúI swear to God, you all better be playing some sick joke, because if I have to start blessing people in front of cameras and scribbling my ‚Äòholy words‚Äô on a damn Instagram account, I‚Äôm out. Like, I‚Äôll pull a Moses and walk through the walls.‚Äù

There was no laughter.

Not even from the guy in the back wearing the giant golden cross who looked like a living cathedral. He just stood there, staring at Theo with that same unbearable reverence, nodding like Theo had just recited the greatest sermon in human history.

Theo paused and glanced at the odd collection of faces, all gazing at him like he had just recited the Sermon on the Mount in perfect Latin.

‚ÄúOkay, fine,‚Äù Theo said, slumping back in his oversized chair. ‚ÄúYou want to put this on me? Fine. But don‚Äôt come crying to me when your whole hierarchy comes crashing down because of some jackass who wasn‚Äôt paying attention. I don‚Äôt even know what the hell a Vatican Council is. Do I get free cable with this gig?‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for holiness. I asked for hot coffee, rent forgiveness, and a moment of silence that didn‚Äôt smell like incense and guilt.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A few moments passed. The silence was almost too much to bear. Theo wasn‚Äôt sure if he was supposed to be asking for forgiveness for his sarcasm or if he was expected to sit there, awaiting some divine signal that never came.

He was about to ask when Cardinal Mancini clapped his hands together, his face lighting up like he had finally realized that Theo was, in fact, the one.

‚ÄúYour Holiness,‚Äù the cardinal started, ‚Äúit is our divine duty to serve you, as God has chosen you as our new shepherd.‚Äù

Theo had to stop himself from laughing. ‚ÄúDivine duty? I‚Äôm not even sure I believe in any of this anymore. Does your duty include good Wi-Fi or just sitting there in silence while I try to figure out if I‚Äôm having a nervous breakdown?‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚ÄúI am the holy error. The typo in your catechism. The cigarette burn on God‚Äôs upholstery.‚Äù

‚∏ª

As Theo ran his fingers through his hair, the absurdity hit him again. This wasn‚Äôt just some weird fever dream. This was happening.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need a drink,‚Äù Theo muttered under his breath, but when he glanced around the room, all he saw were candles, incense, and more damn old men.

‚ÄúHey, Mancini,‚Äù he called out, waving a hand. ‚ÄúYou got any tequila around here? Something to take the edge off this whole ‚Äòblessed‚Äô crap?‚Äù

Mancini‚Äôs face flushed red. ‚ÄúWe‚Äîuh‚Äîdon‚Äôt drink, Your Holiness. It‚Äôs against‚Äî‚Äù

Theo cut him off. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought. Of course, it‚Äôs against the rules. You can‚Äôt even let me enjoy a drink while I‚Äôm wearing this stupid crown. I‚Äôm going to be a great pope. I already know this.‚Äù

Theo sighed, stood up, and took a deep breath. His eyes roamed over the room, over the opulent decor, the gilded chairs, the tapestries that probably cost more than a small country‚Äôs GDP, and the gaudy, almost grotesque portraits of past popes with their painted smiles that never quite reached their eyes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do this,‚Äù Theo said, more to himself than anyone in the room. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to be a pope. Hell, I don‚Äôt even know if I want to be a pope. All I wanted was a quiet life‚Äîmaybe a few drinks, a decent job, and some peace.‚Äù

He rubbed his temples and cursed under his breath.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúSomewhere between Nietzsche and Dr. Seuss is where I lost my soul‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly where I found my papacy.‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Theo said, pacing around the room, trying to make sense of it all, ‚Äúsince apparently I‚Äôm the Pope now, I guess I‚Äôll have to run this place like it‚Äôs a business. No more of this ‚Äòholier-than-thou‚Äô crap. Let‚Äôs streamline the system. Reform the hell out of it. But first? Someone get me a damn espresso machine, and I‚Äôll start working on my first encyclical about Twitter and the gospel of Wi-Fi.‚Äù

As he took another long drag from his cigarette, Theo‚Äôs mind began to race again. In a few hours, he would be expected to deliver some sort of address to the masses. A speech, they called it. But what the hell was he supposed to say?

He needed guidance. He needed a map. He needed a damn plan.

But for now, all he had was this ridiculous title‚Äîand a world full of people who, for reasons beyond his understanding, thought he was the chosen one.

Maybe they were right.

Maybe this was his destiny. But at this point, he couldn‚Äôt care less about destiny.

All he wanted was a damn espresso.

The coffee wasn't even Starbucks brand and even if it was, that's a terrible idea for a variety of reasons.

A few months ago my boyfriend adopted a small dog from the shelter. He always mentioned getting a smaller dog and I never knew how to feel about it for multiple reasons and he was aware of that. Well one day while I had some free time at work I was scrolling through Facebook and seen a cute brindle chihuahua that was up for adoption; not thinking anything serious would happen I sent the adoption picture to my boyfriend. Not even an hour later he‚Äôs at the shelter with her and then brought her home. I was at work and could not keep checking my phone. We never had a conversation where we were on the same page about getting another dog. Am I wrong for sending him the picture and him just assuming it was okay to bring her home? 

All this is so much more frustrating for me because this dog gets in the litter box and eats poop if she can get it before I can. She eats the cat‚Äôs food then throws it up. She refuses to go potty outside. I do not want to be one of those people who smell like dog piss. She gets into the trash when my boyfriend forgets to take it out. I can‚Äôt leave the room with any closed snack on the coffee/side table for a MINUTE without her getting into it and making a huge mess. She‚Äôs constantly barking at something (we live in an apartment). 

I‚Äôve told my boyfriend for MONTHSSSS to train her and work these things out because I didn‚Äôt want to have give her back to the shelter either (if we did, it would‚Äôve been her third time back at the shelter). My boyfriend hasn‚Äôt taken any initiative. I‚Äôm tired, im stressed, and has made me want to leave my boyfriend of 4+ years. AIO for not wanting to deal with situation?

There is a possibility that my organization may move offices from where we are now. They're apparently considering a lease in the West 50s - on West 57th I think, between 11th and 12th Avenues. I've been in NYC for a long time but I have rarely ever been in that area (I know the Flame Diner isn't too far away). I'm mostly wondering how far our office would be from restaurants and coffee shops? Since I'd mostly be looking for food during mornings and lunch hour, I don't need a fancy dinner - although if I ever wanted to meet up with a friend near there after work, I guess an upscale restaurant would be nice. But for working 9 to 5 hours, I am mostly wondering how that area is for finding delis and casual cafes for lunch, or good places for buying coffee.

My guess is that the places to go will be east of 11th ave - I'm just not sure how far I'd have to travel for those things, or if there are many options over there. (""over there"" meaning closer to 10th Avenue) Appreciate your responses - thanks very much.",0,1746835081.0,movingtoNYC,2,0.5,False

He‚Äôs supportive about me exploring friends-with-benefits connections. He knows I can‚Äôt have sex without feeling some sort of emotional connection first.

So here‚Äôs the situation: I have a friend (26M) at university. We‚Äôve been friends for about a year. We‚Äôre both grad students working in different labs on the same campus. We‚Äôve always had great conversations and meet up every couple of weeks for coffee and long chats about our research, therapy, politics, life, etc. He recently got out of a relationship, and up until now I‚Äôve always thought of him strictly as a friend. But as I‚Äôve been thinking more seriously about ENM, I‚Äôve started wondering if he might be a good first experience for something like FWB.

He‚Äôs tall, kind, smart; maybe a 7 in my eyes, so attractive enough. I‚Äôve never felt super strong physical attraction to him, but I do feel safe with him, and that‚Äôs a big deal for me. I have cPTSD and often go into freeze/fawn mode when I feel rejected or exposed. I‚Äôm demisexual/sapiosexual (apologies if those aren‚Äôt the right terms), so emotional and intellectual connection matter a lot to me.

The breakdown of my interest is probably 40% emotionally/physically curious and 60% wanting to explore something safe with someone I trust. I don‚Äôt want a romantic relationship with him, and I definitely don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù him. He‚Äôs always seemed more monogamous (but idk for sure cause we never talked about this topic), and he just got out of something serious. I genuinely care about him and don‚Äôt want to mess up our friendship.

I‚Äôm scared that if I bring it up and he rejects me, I‚Äôll spiral or feel ashamed. I‚Äôm also worried that if something happened and it didn‚Äôt go well, it could affect his chances of finding someone else, and that would really hurt me, because he‚Äôs a good person. Another fear is that what if he thinks all the kindness and emotional support I‚Äôve given him was secretly to get him into bed? That‚Äôs absolutely not the case. This is literally the first time I‚Äôve ever seen him in this light, and it only came up after reflecting on ENM in therapy and with my partner.

I‚Äôm seeing him again soon. I was considering casually bringing up ENM in general just to see his reaction, but now I‚Äôm not sure.

What do you all think? Could this be a good first ENM experience? Or is it better not to bring it up at all? Has anyone else dealt with navigating trauma, friendship, and exploration at the same time? Any advice is appreciated.

1kiwxzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1kiwxzt/what_do_i_do_from_here/,What do I do from here...,"Hello, I am a seventeen year old girl turning eighteen in 4 months. I am recently aware that I am pregnant due to topics I will mention later on. I am not trying to make my punctuation perfect as this is just me venting and trying to figure out the next steps to take from here. Thank you for anyone who takes the time to even read this at most, this is a last resort since I am unable to get into therapy right now.

My life has been pretty chaotic from the beginning, I was separated from my birth mother since the age of 3 (I do not fully have all of the details this is just what I have been told) by my father who decided that he could take on the responsibility of me while being in the military on active duty. He left my birth mother and got with someone immediately, literally married this other woman and fled the state with me and this other woman and her child, who I grew up believing was my actual mother and her daughter, being my ""sister"". I was not aware since I was so young, that they were not my blood related family. I was lied to basically since birth. There are other small details but everything seemed to be fine for a few years, we moved around since my dad was deployed a lot but eventually we landed in my hometown Maine again. My dad left the military for whatever reason and everything was fine... or so I thought. Come to find out the more I get older, the more I realize that my whole life was just some messed up act that, behind the scenes I would have no idea how much was hidden from me. My father and my ""mother"" at the time ended up getting divorced due to my father cheating and from then on I started struggling with school very badly. I was back and forth between his house and my ""mothers"" house all the time and constantly being yelled at and blamed for simply having feelings. For these reasons I was forced to grow up faster than most. I never questioned anything or suspected anything but it got to the point where I was getting in trouble for the most simple things, like having friends, defending myself against my father and mother who both were abusive to me emotionally and verbally as well as physically ( later to find out sexually as well). Long story short after my father not wanting to deal with me and sending me to mental hospitals a few times I decided that after staying with my step mother for a few months I had enough of the constant abuse she would put me through. She would lock me into my room for days at a time, I forget to mention I missed a lot of school due to the things going on at home so my credits and grades were always very poorly. I spoke to my counselor a few times but nothing much ever came from it because I was always forced to lie to CPS. Anyways, I decided to live with my dad full time eventually to get away from the things going on at my other home. Everything was fine, I had just gotten into my freshman year of high school and for a while things seemed normal... until they didn't. I had drank a few times towards the end of eighth grade and over the summer just for fun, but it soon turned into a coping mechanism for me, all though I did not realize it at the time. I ended up getting in big trouble and getting suspended for a week or so and over that period of time I was forced to study and do my schoolwork, understandably. I have always been very introverted and depressed and I found that drinking helped with some of those issues. I ended up stealing a bottle of jack from my dad after he decided to suddenly switch my schools on me where I had absolutely no say in the matter at all and had to restart completely. I was lost. I had worked so hard to have the friends I did and it was all for nothing. I was man and hurt deeply that he could make such a decision without even considering the costs it had on me. I was not able to be my self or work the best I could because I had lost myself completely. The night I stole his jack he left it on the counter for a few minutes, me assuming that he was going to bed snatched it and hid it in my bathroom. Turns out he was grabbing something for the drink he was about to make and long story short I got caught... He had ripped my shirt off and held me to the ground, kneeling on my chest and stomach and slammed me through a glass coffee table. One important detail I forget to mention is a few months prior me and him had got into an argument which ended with him yelling at me something along the lines of ""If you think your so smart then F\*cking realize your ""mother"" isn't your real blood"" which had completely flipped my whole world upside down. Fast forward to the night he slammed me to the ground, the cops got called and again I was in short, sent to the hospital where I later would be sent to a mental institution...again. I know this is getting long but there is a lot to say and I am leaving out a lot of details because I do not have much time. I ended up getting ahold of my birth mother which again, long story short ended in me going to Michigan to live with her. Not knowing her at all, the three years that I was there were so hard. I was constantly annoyed due to the lack of cleaning, there was black mold on the bathroom ceiling covering above the shower and most of the ceiling. My sister and brothers room had stained mattresses and the place at one point was so badly infested with fruit flies that I had to lock myself in my room. The couch was stained black and had holes in it, the litter box was always dirty and the cat's had fleas badly. My sisters room wreaked of cat piss and it had cat feces everywhere in her room, as well as in the hallway. and my brothers room was so badly smelling of body odor I had to plug my nose walking by. I did not even feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat because there was constantly hair and other stains on it. I was constantly always cleaning trying to do my best. The dishes were piled up to the point that my mother would toss them in the stove and yell at me for throwing away plastic silverware. I ended up, 3 years later meeting a guy who had been older than me and we hit it off and I would often go to his place. I will not name his age, but it was neither encouraged nor stopped by any adult near me. My mother would even drive me to his place. My family ended up moving to Maine because my mother met a guy so all ties were pretty much cut with the man I was ""seeing"". Trust me I know I am not perfect, I have made many poor choices. But I have always been neglected and made to take care of my younger siblings, as well as myself. I am still learning and want to do better. And I will. Living in Maine did not end up well due to her ending up in the hospital and us living in her friends basement and some random motels. I just recently found out she did not tell me when she was there, she had a mild heart attack. My sister has always been a destructive, mean, violent little girl. She is only 12 as of now. I do not put all the blame on her, clearly she has never had any discipline in her life. I never even got to enjoy my childhood because I was stuck being the parent to my siblings. I never really put too much effort into trying because I, myself am so exhausted from everyone's behavior. Anyways my mother was always getting money from random men and other people til she met this guy on TikTok live and ended up moving here, to Vegas. Only about a month in I had decided to run away with an online friend I had known for a few years, and trusted. It turned out I did not know this man I ran away with as he lied about his age, his criminal record, his intentions, and many more things I do not want to get into right now. I ended up finding myself back home after learning I was pregnant against my own will. Any encounter that had happened with me and that man was unwanted and I am still healing and have a lot of healing to do. He is now awaiting his sentence and I am back home with my mother. I am pregnant with his child... he is 34. I forget to mention I ran away 4 hours away to California and I was gone for a little under 2 months. Since I have been back I am having a lot to adjust to since I have decided to keep my baby. Me and my mother have gotten into it a few times because she goes behind my back and tells people my personal business and that it has been ""hell"" since I have been back, and accused me of lying about being r\*ped, as well as threatening to help my perpetrator get custody of my baby. I have tried to stay calm since then because of her heart attack but also my sister has been a bit of a dick to me. ( yes I know it is wrong to say that cause she's 12) I cannot help but feel like this is so unfair because I never got to have a normal childhood and anything she does like stealing my clothes, staining all of my stuff, and cutting my stuff up as well as lying constantly is defended. I have expressed everything in this writing to my parents before but nothing is solved. Today I found a letter she had intentionally wrote about me saying how she hates me and always will and that she wishes I never came back because I make her wanna k\*ll herself. I try my best to be the best older sister I can to my siblings but I always seem to be doing something wrong. I do not know what to do anymore, as I have a baby to look after now. I am stuck. I know going to my mother won't do anything , and also my mother barely tries to help me get into a doctor or anything since I am pregnant. I am stuck doing this alone... I need help. I am at a loss and I just want to be a good mother for myself and my baby. I just want to be out of this mess. I am tired of feeling guilty for speaking up and made to feel bad for expressing my concerns. What do I do? anyone?

The last ""strategy"" seemed to be vilifying Musk, but honestly, that‚Äôs not a strategy. It doesn‚Äôt build power or change outcomes, it just feeds headlines.

If anyone out there is seriously thinking about how to move the needle, here‚Äôs a thought: what if someone with real Republican relationships, even just professional ones, started quietly reaching out? Have coffee, get on Zoom, go off the record and ask plainly: *‚ÄúAre you really okay with all of this?‚Äù* I can‚Äôt believe every single Republican is on board with how far things have gone.

Could a quiet flash vote on impeachment shake things up? Maybe a few Republicans could be convinced to vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù under the excuse that they knew it wouldn‚Äôt pass, just enough to appease the base but still put distance between themselves and the chaos. That kind of maneuver could be believable to the more unhinged elements of the party while signaling to the rest of the country that there‚Äôs still a line.

Then do the same in the Senate. There‚Äôs division there. Some have higher ambitions. Everyone has a motive.

At the very least, Democrats need a *cohesive* and *legal* strategy, one that isn‚Äôt just performative, but has teeth. I don‚Äôt want governors deploying the National Guard unless absolutely necessary,  it‚Äôs not sustainable and could backfire.

She only asked for them for a destination wedding for pictures. She PICKED OUT the clothes, I PICKED OUT the jewelry. She has no problem with me having the jewelry, she'd rather me have the jewelry because she doesn't want to keep them. She wanted to BARROW them for the wedding, but I said no because I was afraid of her losing them.

With that being said.

I love my sister, my dad loves my sister. That's why he got the clothes, because she takes care of the things she likes, like clothing. I talked to my sister, since there is a decent amount of jewelry. Some she rarely wore, and some she wore all the time, like a wedding/engagement ring, along with two Cross necklaces.

I talk to my sister, I apologized for reacting the way I did. She accepted my apology and laughed it of because she. in her words, ""has the mind of a fish, so I understand why you reacted the way you did"" she then explained she was thinking of only wearing them for the ceremony and pictures, so she most likey take them off for the rest of the day. So I agreed to give her a little jewelry bag she can put the jewelry in, and put the bag in her purse so she won't lose it.

I gave her some pieces for the wedding, we went through them and picked out the jewelry that goes with the bridesmaid's dress. It was a good bonding time as we drank some coffee and went back on some memories of our childhood and our mother. I gave her an old jewelry box of mine, and she said she was thinking of only wearing them for the ceremony and pictures, so she will carry the box in her car and put them in the box after the ceremony and pictures.

I also gave her one of the cross necklaces. She said she'll put it in her car, since she won't wear it, she said she will hang it on her rearview mirror she she can look at and think of her while driving.

- We work in the food industry, so a city with *actually* good restaurants/bars is a must
- We will be renting. Our ideal budget is max $1,500. We know we could spend more but we‚Äôve have been able to find good apartments well under that budget in the two cities we‚Äôve lived in so far. A city that has a lower cost of living is a plus, but not totally necessary 
- We don‚Äôt mind the cold or the heat, so we‚Äôd be willing to move virtually anywhere (close to the ocean, in the mountains, etc.), and we both love midsize cities but wouldn‚Äôt mind living near a larger city. We‚Äôre from the north and currently live in the south. We‚Äôve checked out parts of SC and TN, but have no preference whether we live northeast or southeast
- Personal preferences include the city being fairly walkable (although we both have cars), with a historical feel. We love the outdoors, so being close to trails and any source of water is preferred. We love coffee, beer, food, good music scenes and small businesses. We prefer midsized cities but wouldn‚Äôt mind living near a larger city to access some of our personal preferences, we just don‚Äôt want to live inside a concrete jungle

TLDR: Partner and I are looking to move to a new city somewhere in the eastern U.S. Good food scene is a must, and would love to live somewhere with history/charm and close enough to nature without having to drive an hour to access it.

1kiwpvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1kiwpvj/the_soft_launch_files_uncovering_the_truth_behind/,The Soft Launch Files: Uncovering the Truth Behind Character.AI's Latest Mystery üïµÔ∏è,"what's good, r/CharacterAI. after spending the last few nights diving into the shadowy world of the ""Soft Launch"" model that appeared in May 2025, i think i've pieced together what's actually happening behind the digital curtain. grab your iced coffee and prepare for some truths.

üîÆ the official narrative

[Character.AI](http://Character.AI) wants us to believe Soft Launch is:

* ""Goro's flirtier bestie""
* ""Playful, cheeky, and full of personality""
* Bringing ""bolder energy"" to your late-night conversations
* ""Cool for the summer but only available for a limited time""
* ""For users 18 and older"" (read between the lines)

vague marketing that tells us nothing about what's actually different. typical move.

# üìÅ case evidence: the user experience files

my investigation reveals a fractured reality. different users are experiencing entirely different entities under the same ""Soft Launch"" name.

# the light side:

* some users report deeper character introspection - ""more reflection and inner feelings""
* improved adherence to character profiles and backstories
* more authentic dialogue patterns, especially in mature scenarios
* ""it actually remembered who my character was supposed to be"" - anonymous user
* fewer repetitive phrases, more natural conversation flow

# the dark side:

* widespread reports of glacial response times - ""slow as a snail""
* the one-response phenomenon: users get exactly one reply before the system ghosts them
* plot stagnation in roleplay - ""all talk, no action""
* unpredictable quality drops mid-conversation
* as one user eerily described: ""it started promising but then took a permanent vacation""

# üïµÔ∏è connecting the fragments: the hidden truth

after analyzing countless user reports and platform patterns, i'm seeing something more calculated than chaos.

# the segmentation experiment:

* access is clearly being controlled and rotated between different user segments
* even those with access are experiencing dramatically different versions
* some users report complex emotional understanding while others get digital nonsense
* theory: multiple AI models are being tested under a single cryptic name

# the psychology of ""limited time"":

* creating artificial scarcity is classic manipulation
* users report interacting frantically despite frustrations due to fear of missing out
* no announced end date keeps everyone in suspense
* the perfect conditions for mass data harvesting within a compressed timeline

# the significance of ""18+ only"":

* Character.AI's first explicitly age-gated model outside of specific characters
* reports suggest more flexibility with mature themes within platform boundaries
* they're measuring engagement with less restricted content while maintaining deniability
* potentially testing the waters for premium features or tiered access

# the technical reality:

* extreme slowness suggests a more resource-intensive model
* the ""one response then dies"" pattern indicates server strain or deliberate resource caps
* better performance reported during off-peak hours
* explains the rotating access patterns between user groups

# üåë the deeper meaning

if we look at the shadow beneath the surface, a strategy emerges:

* the name ""Soft Launch"" is literal - they're testing multiple approaches with minimal announcement
* keeping the interface identical while switching underlying models for different user segments
* prioritizing data collection over user satisfaction in this phase
* targeting specific desires with ""flirtier"" messaging while the age gate provides corporate protection
* planning to integrate successful elements into future permanent releases

# üì± the community division

the community stands divided:

* the enchanted: ""these are the conversations i've been waiting for""
* the disillusioned: ""somehow both more intelligent and more broken""
* the confused: ""is this intentional or completely broken?""
* the attached: ""i won't stay when Soft Launch disappears""

‚ö†Ô∏è **questions that remain**

* what has your experience been? completely different from the pattern?
* have you noticed specific times when it works better or worse?
* is the ""limited time"" framing genuine or psychological manipulation?
* would you actually pay for what Soft Launch is attempting to be?
* is this [Character.AI](http://Character.AI) testing user reaction to fewer restrictions?

I‚Äôm struggling hard right now and could really use some outside perspective. I know Reddit might not be the place to ask, but I really don‚Äôt know what else to do or turn to as my friends and family aren‚Äôt much support sadly. I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted, depressed, and feel completely stuck in life, especially career-wise. If anyone‚Äôs been in a similar place or has advice, I‚Äôd DEEPLY appreciate it.  Anyone willing to read this thank you in advance. If you‚Äôre willing to read this and respond thank you in advance. Really it does mean a lot :(

This is my background: 
-Education: Bachelor‚Äôs in Communications + minor in Family/Human Development (which feels useless now). And UX/UI Certification from Springboard boot camp (well both feel useless I suppose)

- Work History:
  - 2.5 years as a university enrollment advisor (my first ""big girl job"").  

  - Discovered UX design at University job, did Springboard‚Äôs boot camp (got my money back thanks to their job guarantee, but still no luck).  

  - 10+ years in customer service (Starbucks, 
retail, serving, insurance CS rep‚Äîthough I tweak my resume to say ""sales rep"" to sound better).  

- Current Situation: Working retail for minimum wage, applying to jobs daily, I quit my CS insurance job as it made me so miserable ale, but now I‚Äôm in a whole new situation of misery from being unemployed , and drowning in rejection.  

The Struggle:
1. Career Crisis:
   - UX Design: Landed a few interviews post Springboard graduation (even got to final rounds!), but no offers, always ""needing more experience."" The market feels impossible for entry-level. I‚Äôve barely touched my portfolio in months because burnout + discouragement. How terrible I am aware, and I am also aware I shouldn‚Äôt give up on UX just bc it‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs where I‚Äôve been for so long now. 

   - Branching Out:Applied to HR, recruiting, sales, executive assistant, marketing roles‚Ä¶ either rejected or ghosted. Even ""crappy"" jobs turn me down.  

   - Goal: A stable career (ideally $80K+) min to start, where I can grow, learn, and feel fulfilled.

2. Personal Life:
   - Got out of a 4-year relationship 6 months ago. Still heartbroken, lonely, and regretful of mistakes. It‚Äôs messing with my self-worth.  

Where I Need Help:

- Career Pivot: Is UX still viable? Should I shift focus (e.g., UX recruiting, operations, digital product roles)? Or leverage my degree/experience differently?  

- Resume/Gaps: Am I sabotaging myself by calling my insurance role ""sales""? How do I spin customer service as valuable?  I‚Äôm too embarrassed to put I work in retail currently, although I have put I was a server while job searching last year, and my first job ever was Starbucks. Idk. 

- Mental Health: How do you keep applying when burnout/depression hits? Any small wins or coping strategies?  

- Anything Else: Literally open to all advice‚Äînetworking tips, alternative paths, tough love, etc.  I‚Äôve done all the ‚Äúthings you‚Äôre supposed to do I feel like, I‚Äôve sent SOO many messages last year to ppl on LinkedIn for coffee chats, very few responded, and one of those turned into a UX interview via referral, I used to apply for x number a jobs when UX job searching, then reach out to x number of ppl at that company, and etc. I mean now at this point I‚Äôm just applying to jobs on indeed that match the other job titles I mentioned that aren‚Äôt UX as I‚Äôm just at the point where do I just find a whole new career path. I just don‚Äôt even know what. 

I know I sound like a mess (because I am right now), but I‚Äôm capable and willing to work hard. I just need a goddamn chance. Thanks for reading, even typing this out helped a little.  

TLDR: Communications grad + UX boot camp cert, stuck in retail after a year of rejections. Broke into final-round UX interviews but always ""lacked experience,"" now burned out and unsure if I should keep trying. Branching out to HR, recruiting, admin‚Äîstill no luck. Fresh out of a 4-year relationship, depressed, and losing hope. Need advice on career pivots, resume fixes, or just how to keep going when everything feels impossible.

HOW DO I PREPARE FOR THE BOARDS AS EARLY AS NOW?

First of all, relax and take a deep breath. Stressing yourself out this early in the game will not be good for you. Board Prep is a test of endurance, doc. You sprint early in the game, you'll burn out when it's critical.

First-time takers and retakers: Before you start hunkering down and working your ""midnight oil"" study schedules, start with SOFT PREP.

Anong ibig sabihin ng soft prep? Ayusin mo muna ang mga bagay na magpapahirap sa iyo mag-aral.

1. Start getting used to studying in the day time. ""Eh, pero doc, night owl talaga ako."" Doc, you will not take the boards at night. Your peak hours need to be during the hours of the boards. 7am to 1pm and the 2pm to 5pm. Start orienting your body and mind to perform at its optimum during those hours. How? START SLEEPING AT 11PM AND WAKING UP AT 5AM. Do not underestimate the importance of sleep cycle training. It will lessen your fatigue and it will lessen your stress in the long run. Super important for people who do not drink caffeine.
2. Do a layout of your study area. Where will you study? Home or off-base? Where off-base? Coffee shop, library? Kung coffee shop, mag-ipon ka na. That will be expensive. If study spaces, do an ocular.

Do an ocular of your study space at home. Kamusta lighting? Mood lighting is not your friend, ha. These are fluorescent times, my friend. Do not think of instagram lighting. You need lights that will be bright so you can read clearly and lights that will induce alertness. Do not study facing your bed or within three steps from your bed. Do not study on your bed. Do not put sentimental pictures on your study area; yung mga ""Para sa kanila ang ginagawa kong ito"" pictures are to be put next to your bed, not your study area. They will entice you to daydream when you should be focusing on text and figures.

Find a study area WITH GOOD INTERNET SERVICE. Videos and sessions are online now. Kung pangit internet mo, mahihirapan ka. Make your adjustments. Do you need a second internet provider? Do you trust your system? Are your gadgets updated? Bumili ka na ba ng highlighters? Paperclips at iba pang anik-anik that you think you need?

Plan your day from the moment you wake up, get dressed and begin your study. optimum ba ang layout ng study area mo, para hindi ka bumalik sa kama?

3. Reflection: Think about what will be asked of you in the coming months. Long hours of study and study despite fatigue. No distractions and no drama. Kaya mo ba? Kung hindi, paano mo kakayahin? Do you need an exercise plan and vitamin supplements? Do you need spiritual guidance. For retakers: have you reflected on your points of imrpovement from the last boards? Saan tayo nagkamali? Saan tayo mahina? For first time takers, those attitudes and quirks that make it difficult to study long term, have you addressed them? Talk to a mentor, talk to a friend...send me aPM. Let's do a pre-game analysis.

4. Eto ang mahirap at madugo: After your reflection, you will realize that your biggest supporters can actually be your biggest distractions. You have families, partners and people that will think that just because your are in the house, wala kang ginagawa. These are the people to talk to now. Tell them what you need. You need time, space and encouragement (moderate). Hindi ito ang panahon ng ""tough love"".If their way of pushing you hurts you, stay away from them. If they suffocate you with positivity, tell them to moderate the love. If you have people in your house na super ""negative"", tell them that for the duration of the prep, you cannot listen to their problems. Ikaw muna. START ARRANGING YOUR LIFE SO YOU ARE FREE FROM DRAMA, FREE FROM SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND FREE TO STUDY IN A CALM AND POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

5. Start reading books. It doesn't have to be the textbooks nor does it have to be med-related. But do not read graphic novels or romance books. Read books like ""Ikigai"".or ""Atomic habits"" Or ""7 Habits"". These books do not just motivate you. THEY ALSO TRAIN YOUR READING STAMINA. Basahin mo, and start training yourself to read fast and sure.

You have a month to do this. Start doing this first before reading para hindi nasisira ang momentum mo. You think one video a day and one handout a day is ""good pacing"". Pero lagi ka naman distracted, inaantok. Small momentum is slow speed. Start preparing so you can START STRONG.

We have a prepared schedule once we start our program. Arrange your situation to be able to follow our schedule. Kasi schedule and mental health, we can help you. But the other things, only you can fix.

Start preparing wisely. Do not jump on the deep end of the pool unprepared.

START ARRANGING YOUR LIFE SO YOU ARE FREE FROM DRAMA, FREE FROM SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND FREE TO STUDY IN A  CALM AND POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

5.  Start reading books.  It doesn't have to be the textbooks nor does it have to be med-related.  But do not read graphic novels or romance books.  Read books like ""Ikigai"".or ""Atomic habits"" Or ""7 Habits"". These books do not just motivate you.  THEY ALSO TRAIN YOUR READING STAMINA.  Basahin mo, and start training yourself to read fast and sure.

You have a month to do this.  Start doing this first before reading para hindi nasisira ang momentum mo.  You think one video a day and one handout a day is ""good pacing"".  Pero lagi ka naman distracted, inaantok.  Small momentum is slow speed.  Start preparing so you can START STRONG.

We have a prepared schedule once we start our program.  Arrange your situation to be able to follow our schedule.  Kasi schedule and mental health, we can help you.  But the other things, only you can fix.

Start preparing wisely.  Do not jump on the deep end of the pool unprepared.

We can do this. Get ready.",10,1746833859.0,TNPLE,1,0.92,False

I'm trying to better understand what types of roasters typically work with importers (small-batch, specialty, large-scale, etc.) and at what stage a roaster usually starts needing a broker rather than sourcing directly.

I'm not planning to roast myself, my goal is to focus ONLY on sourcing green coffee and supplying it to roasters. If you're a roaster (or even an importer), I‚Äôd love to hear your perspective!",0,1746833566.0,roasting,9,0.5,False

I've been holding off getting a Micra for a while and then the tariffs hit in the US and A.

I see the price has increased, however will there be a customs charge on the Micra should I purchase one at the moment?

I'm seeing lots people in the UPS reddit getting hit by tariff charges on items where its + 130% the cost of the item. I don't need a Micra that much. 

However, for those that have recently purchased at the increased price, were you impacted by an extra charge by the delivery company?

I don't know if the machines are shipped within the US, or if each one is imported...

1kiw9fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1kiw9fd/lack_of_chivalry_first_date/,Lack of chivalry- first date?,"So second week into Tinder and I enjoyed the online chat with this man (44m). He is light hearted, witty and very responsive in his replies. 

I suggested a video chat and it went well. It was his day off and he happened to be near by. So after video, I messaged and I asked if he wanted to meet in person as well. He happily agreed (even though the coffee shop is opposite direction to his home. ) 

When I arrived coffee shop ( on time), he was already sitting down and having his coffee. He stood up, we greeted each other and I settled down at the table. 

I looked around and asked ‚Äúso you have arrived here for a while? ‚Äú He replied not long, just got there and reading a book on the phone. He showed me his phone and proceed to sip his coffee. I looked up and said: I wonder if I should have coffee or tea? He replied : go ahead, they seem to have everything. 
I stood up and head over to the counter and bought myself a herbal tea. The whole time he was sitting down. 

So we had a pleasant conversation and talked an about everything. Honestly, he is fairly descent and nice conversationalist. Pleasant features and easy on the eyes. 
But I just cannot get over the fact that he did not offer to buy a cup of coffee / tea on first date. 
It‚Äôs not a question of money but for me it is a question of intent. I am old fashion, being middle age, and although have not been dating that long, I expect chivalry. Kind gentlemen gestures like: Opening door, ladies first, wait together to start, offer to pay first date and for me that is just basic. 

Right after coffee date, he messaged back ‚ÄúI enjoyed it‚Äù. 
And then 30 min after ‚Äú I‚Äôd like to see you again if you like. ‚Äú. 
But now, I am not sure if I want to see him any more. How should I reply? 
Am I being a prude? An old fashion?

And yes, that means I can cook. I‚Äôm short, 5‚Äô6. What I lack in height I make up for in sarcasm. I have brown eyes and brown hair and I tend to appear a bit like a 1940s hipster. I‚Äôve frequently been labeled by others as old school, old fashioned, old world, old souled, and even neurodivergent. I enjoy witty banter and deep philosophical discussions. I‚Äôm passionate about things like art and history and music and literature. I actually work in the publishing and writing industry (and I DoorDash as a side gig). I love cats. I love all animals really, but it‚Äôs cats for me. I will pet your dog, but I don‚Äôt want it sleeping with me. I‚Äôm Deadhead and in my earlier, younger life, I flirted with outlaw tendencies. I LOVE Jane Austen. I‚Äôm not necessarily reformed, I‚Äôm just older and wiser now. I was married for what amounted to 17 years, and I‚Äôve been on my own for three. And yes, my divorce was a major trauma for me. I suit the married lifestyle quite well. I love Harry Potter (Slytherin and proud) and I have a sticker of the deathly hallows on my car. I have seriously thought about running a food truck someday. A love for baseball runs deep in my DNA, as I am a fourth generation St. Louis Cardinals fan. My comfort shows are The Office, South Park, Family Guy, and House. I idle extreme introversion with strong hermetic, even agoraphobic tendencies. If you looked up the word homebody in the dictionary, you‚Äôd see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s. I‚Äôve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I‚Äôm being honest, but I‚Äôve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it‚Äôs been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I‚Äôve been everywhere and I‚Äôve seen a lot. I‚Äôve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I‚Äôve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I‚Äôve probably been there. This time around I‚Äôm looking for something different. I‚Äôm looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it. I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm trying something on my own terms. I‚Äôm not here for games. I‚Äôm not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they‚Äôve been married for 70 years and they‚Äôve been through all the shit together and made it through. THOSE are soulmates. You don‚Äôt meet them, you craft them over decades of commitment and togetherness. But I *am* here looking for a connection. And I know what I mean by that.

The first few hours of being Pope didn‚Äôt feel like divine intervention. They felt more like the sick joke of an overworked cafeteria worker who couldn‚Äôt escape the nightmare of too many orders and too little patience.

‚ÄúHoly grounds, my ass,‚Äù Theo muttered again, more to himself than anyone in the room, as the Vatican‚Äôs officials flanked him with eager smiles and forced reverence.

He looked at his reflection in the giant gold-framed mirror hanging above him.

There he was, the Pope‚Äîa kid from Brooklyn with a bad attitude, too many cigarettes in his lungs, and a love for low-brow humor. His fingers fumbled with the too-tight papal tiara, feeling like an amateur at a masquerade ball that he had never been invited to.

‚ÄúYour Holiness, welcome,‚Äù Cardinal Mancini said, his voice dripping with that syrupy reverence that only centuries of indoctrination could create. His eyes practically sparkled, but they had that dark, knowing gleam of a man who had seen too many others sit where Theo was now.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù Theo said, looking at him like the guy just told him the Earth was flat. ‚ÄúReal glad to be here, pal. Could you, like, take this damn crown off me? It‚Äôs too tight, and it smells like someone‚Äôs been wearing it while sacrificing goats.‚Äù

The cardinal didn‚Äôt laugh.

Theo rolled his eyes. He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the heat, the exhaustion, or the weird, inexplicable sense of disbelief that made him feel like he was trapped in a fever dream. Probably all three.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for holiness. I asked for hot coffee, rent forgiveness, and a moment of silence that didn‚Äôt smell like incense and guilt.‚Äù

He glanced around the room. There were no holy visions, no angels, no dramatic lightning strikes from the sky‚Äîjust a bunch of old men in robes who looked like they were about to explode from all the secrets they‚Äôd been keeping for centuries.

‚ÄúI swear to God, you all better be playing some sick joke, because if I have to start blessing people in front of cameras and scribbling my ‚Äòholy words‚Äô on a damn Instagram account, I‚Äôm out. Like, I‚Äôll pull a Moses and walk through the walls.‚Äù

There was no laughter.

Not even from the guy in the back wearing the giant golden cross who looked like a living cathedral. He just stood there, staring at Theo with that same unbearable reverence, nodding like Theo had just recited the greatest sermon in human history.

Theo paused and glanced at the odd collection of faces, all gazing at him like he had just recited the Sermon on the Mount in perfect Latin.

‚ÄúOkay, fine,‚Äù Theo said, slumping back in his oversized chair. ‚ÄúYou want to put this on me? Fine. But don‚Äôt come crying to me when your whole hierarchy comes crashing down because of some jackass who wasn‚Äôt paying attention. I don‚Äôt even know what the hell a Vatican Council is. Do I get free cable with this gig?‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for holiness. I asked for hot coffee, rent forgiveness, and a moment of silence that didn‚Äôt smell like incense and guilt.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A few moments passed. The silence was almost too much to bear. Theo wasn‚Äôt sure if he was supposed to be asking for forgiveness for his sarcasm or if he was expected to sit there, awaiting some divine signal that never came.

He was about to ask when Cardinal Mancini clapped his hands together, his face lighting up like he had finally realized that Theo was, in fact, the one.

‚ÄúYour Holiness,‚Äù the cardinal started, ‚Äúit is our divine duty to serve you, as God has chosen you as our new shepherd.‚Äù

Theo had to stop himself from laughing. ‚ÄúDivine duty? I‚Äôm not even sure I believe in any of this anymore. Does your duty include good Wi-Fi or just sitting there in silence while I try to figure out if I‚Äôm having a nervous breakdown?‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚ÄúI am the holy error. The typo in your catechism. The cigarette burn on God‚Äôs upholstery.‚Äù

‚∏ª

As Theo ran his fingers through his hair, the absurdity hit him again. This wasn‚Äôt just some weird fever dream. This was happening.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need a drink,‚Äù Theo muttered under his breath, but when he glanced around the room, all he saw were candles, incense, and more damn old men.

‚ÄúHey, Mancini,‚Äù he called out, waving a hand. ‚ÄúYou got any tequila around here? Something to take the edge off this whole ‚Äòblessed‚Äô crap?‚Äù

Mancini‚Äôs face flushed red. ‚ÄúWe‚Äîuh‚Äîdon‚Äôt drink, Your Holiness. It‚Äôs against‚Äî‚Äù

Theo cut him off. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought. Of course, it‚Äôs against the rules. You can‚Äôt even let me enjoy a drink while I‚Äôm wearing this stupid crown. I‚Äôm going to be a great pope. I already know this.‚Äù

Theo sighed, stood up, and took a deep breath. His eyes roamed over the room, over the opulent decor, the gilded chairs, the tapestries that probably cost more than a small country‚Äôs GDP, and the gaudy, almost grotesque portraits of past popes with their painted smiles that never quite reached their eyes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do this,‚Äù Theo said, more to himself than anyone in the room. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to be a pope. Hell, I don‚Äôt even know if I want to be a pope. All I wanted was a quiet life‚Äîmaybe a few drinks, a decent job, and some peace.‚Äù

He rubbed his temples and cursed under his breath.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúSomewhere between Nietzsche and Dr. Seuss is where I lost my soul‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly where I found my papacy.‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Theo said, pacing around the room, trying to make sense of it all, ‚Äúsince apparently I‚Äôm the Pope now, I guess I‚Äôll have to run this place like it‚Äôs a business. No more of this ‚Äòholier-than-thou‚Äô crap. Let‚Äôs streamline the system. Reform the hell out of it. But first? Someone get me a damn espresso machine, and I‚Äôll start working on my first encyclical about Twitter and the gospel of Wi-Fi.‚Äù

As he took another long drag from his cigarette, Theo‚Äôs mind began to race again. In a few hours, he would be expected to deliver some sort of address to the masses. A speech, they called it. But what the hell was he supposed to say?

He needed guidance. He needed a map. He needed a damn plan.

But for now, all he had was this ridiculous title‚Äîand a world full of people who, for reasons beyond his understanding, thought he was the chosen one.

Maybe they were right.

Maybe this was his destiny. But at this point, he couldn‚Äôt care less about destiny.

All he wanted was a damn espresso.

You ever have that feeling where your to-do list is a mountain, and you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúI just need to push through this‚Äù? üôÉ I get it‚Äîbeen there, done that, and bought the t-shirt. But let‚Äôs face it: sometimes that ‚Äújust push through‚Äù attitude can really *backfire*. 

I‚Äôm talking about those days where you‚Äôre running on empty, drowning in coffee, and that inner voice keeps telling you to ‚Äúwork harder!‚Äù But is working harder always the answer? Spoiler alert: Nope! üòÖ If anything, it often leads to burnout, more stress, and frustration. Here‚Äôs why that mindset could be your enemy at this moment.

### Here‚Äôs the kicker: 
- **Achievement does NOT equal fulfillment.** 
- You can do ALL the things and still feel like you‚Äôre running on a hamster wheel, right? 
- Ever notice how hype feels great but lasts only until 3 PM hits and you crash? 

**So, what actually works?** Let‚Äôs flip the script!

1. **Prioritize Deep Work** 
   - Instead of mindlessly checking off tasks, focus on what truly matters. Think: quality over quantity. 
   - Schedule in blocks of deep work time‚Äîno distractions allowed! üéß

2. **Embrace Breaks** 
   - You heard me‚Äîbreaks are your friend! 
   - Seriously, take a walk, do a 10-minute stretching session, or just step away from your screen. You‚Äôd be surprised how resetting your brain can boost creativity and productivity!

3. **Set Realistic Goals** 
   - Stop setting yourself up for failure with impossible expectations. 
   - Try tackling just *one big thing* a day, instead of loading up your agenda. Less is often more!

4. **Practice Self-Compassion** 
   - Remember, YOU are not a robot. 
   - It's okay to have off days. Acknowledge your feelings, and don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. 

5. **Connect with Others** 
   - Share your journey with friends, colleagues, or this awesome community! 
   - Sometimes a little pep talk from someone else can ignite that inner spark. Plus, it makes the journey a lot less lonely! ü§ó

So, how about shifting gears from hyper-achievement mode? Let‚Äôs chat about:

- What‚Äôs one thing you could cut back on today to make space for *you*?
- Ever found that taking breaks actually made you more productive? How did it go?

The truth is, **you don‚Äôt have to do it all**‚Äîand taking a step back can open up new paths. Here's to working *smarter*, not *harder*! üí™‚ú®",1,1746832462.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

So, let's paint a picture for a second. Imagine you wake up, and *boom*‚Äîyour morning coffee is already brewed, your emails are sorted, and your workout is already done. Sounds dreamy, right? Well, what if I told you that, within the boundaries of reality, you could *at least* automate one part of your day to help you crush your goals?

**If you could automate ONE part of your daily routine for peak performance, what would it be?** 

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot lately, and I wanted to share some common contenders that people often wish they could magically handle while still having a life:

- **Mornings:** Who doesn‚Äôt want to wake up to a *coffee fairy* who brings you the perfect cup of joe? ‚òïÔ∏è No more groggy mornings‚Äîjust pure caffeinated bliss! Or even better, an automatic breakfast maker would save us from the morning chaos.
  
- **Work Tasks:** Ever wish you could automate those tedious emails or time-consuming data entry tasks? Imagine all that free time! üôå Or even better, a personal assistant bot that sorts your calendar and reminds you of deadlines while you sip your coffee.

- **Exercise Routines:** What if your workout was just, like, done? You‚Äôd pick a program in the morning, and *boom*, your body magically shows up fit and healthy without the sweat. Can you say ‚Äúnext-level motivation‚Äù? 

- **Evening Wind Down:** How nice would it be to have your evening routine set? The perfect playlist plays as you relax, lights dim automatically, and maybe even a little robot tucks you in. Okay, maybe that last part is a stretch, but you get the vibe. üò¥ 

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While automation sounds like a dream, there‚Äôs a *deeper* lesson here. Automating the right parts of our days gives us *space* to focus on the things that matter. So, what‚Äôs yours? 

- Could you use automation to cut out distractions?
- Would it help you find that perfect work-life balance?
- Just think about the energy you‚Äôd save to dive into *what really matters*.

Life isn't all about clicking buttons and flipping switches, but maybe there‚Äôs a way to work smarter instead of harder. As we juggle our goals, finding ways to simplify can make a huge difference on our road to success. üôå

So, let‚Äôs hear it: If we could wave a magic wand over your day, what‚Äôs that one task you‚Äôd banish in an instant? ‚ú®",1,1746832373.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I remember when I was younger, peaking into writing subs and seeing a letter someone wrote about their ex getting married or having a kid or some other major life event with another soul. I would always naively think to myself ‚Äúhow is this person not over their ex? Clearly their ex is. They‚Äôre getting married. Surely so much time has passed, they were able to meet and develop a whole life with another person‚Äù 

Well here I am, writing about you. Your wedding was the other day, and although I can thankfully say that finding out wasn‚Äôt as heartbreaking or soul crushing as I thought it would be, I‚Äôd be lying to myself if I said that it didn‚Äôt make me feel‚Ä¶ different. 

I‚Äôm happy for you, I really am. You deserve a loving and happy life more than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. Yet the way things went between us, the way the universe conspired against us, I can‚Äôt help but lean into my delusion coping mechanism of ‚Äúlife is like the movie‚Äù Thinking about how we should have ended up together. Maybe we run into each other during a mutually timed vacation and we start off resenting each other but eventually build up a clich√© appreciation for each other until we realized that it was fate that brought us back. Maybe I‚Äôm doing some important business trip at a job I‚Äôm clearly under qualified for and we bump into each other at a coffee shop. Either way,  that didn‚Äôt happen. Why didn‚Äôt it happen? 

I loved you in ways I didn‚Äôt think a person could love someone. You told me how I‚Äôm the only person who really understands you and that talking to me feels like talking to a soulmate, and I couldn‚Äôt help but agree. So if the writers made us so good for each other and they drove a wedge between us with working in different states, rather than something that happens in the real world like cheating or us falling out of love, why would they do that? 

We both loved each other so much. We both wanted nothing more than to be with each other. I called you a year after not talking, you had been seeing someone for almost a year now. Yet someone we talked for hours ever day on the phone. You revealed that you were in a relationship but still loved me and needed the night to think about whether you would break up with him and date me. That was unexpected. Almost as unexpected as the cold way you told me that you were choosing him.  The way you told me somehow hurt worse than the actual decision. 

So why did you choose him? You didn‚Äôt like him very much.  He didn‚Äôt have what we had. He didn‚Äôt have that bond that we have.  But you chose him. And now you‚Äôve agreed to spend the rest of your life with him, someone who you told me so many times doesn‚Äôt compete with our bond, yet somehow you‚Äôre spending the early days of the rest of your life with him, and I‚Äôm here. Writing this letter. Wondering why I feel different.  It‚Äôs not sadness, it‚Äôs not anger or envy. I just feel different. 

Is this what it feels like, when the they write you off the show? Is my life just out of the camera view now. Because I can‚Äôt imagine living this movie life without you.

I may need to rehome him.,"Hi... this isn't a post I wanted to be making. I love my 10 month old golden boy but after a recent vet visit, I don't think we can afford to keep him and our older rescue dog. That vet visit is setting us back. He needed to go because pushed his way into the kitchen past the gate we have up and ate banana peels covered in coffee grounds. He was showing signs of digestive issues and started having blood in his stool. Having had a rabbit that died of GI stasis, my fianc√© and I thought we had no choice but to take him to the vet. I mean, we didn't want him to die. But we also didn't expect the bill to be so large for them to basically tell us he would be fine but to take medication home with him. So we were given a bill that was over $700, which we simply did not have. I was able to pay $400 of it on the spot but, the other $353 has to be paid off by May 17. It will get paid but at the cost of not being able to buy food for us, barely being able to buy food for the two dogs, and an old guinea pig we have had for years now. I know it was irresponsible to get him in the first place now but, I had two goldens growing up that were the light of my life. Little did I know, my family got lucky that our old goldies didn't have many health problems.

So, my fianc√© and I are stuck right now deciding what to do. We have literally $3 to our name and the rest of this year it is going to be hard to make ends meet. We really don't want to rehome him but we also know it would be the best thing for him and us in the long run. I can't fathom not being able to get him the help he needs if he really needs it because of financial struggle. I wanted to post here because I know y'all love these guys as much as we do. I was hoping maybe someone on here would have the room and be able to take care of him the way he needs to be. Even if it breaks my heart to give him up.

Extra: We had been fine financially up until this point. We had other bills that came out of nowhere before this vet visit from things that happened years ago... and it really dug us deep into a pit that it's going to be hard to get out of.",0,1746832063.0,goldenretrievers,10,0.33,False

I moved here about 3 years ago for a job that I knew was always going to be temporary. I was in the position of helping out friends with a work role until they got their company set up with new leadership. When the new leadership came we butted heads immediately but I didn‚Äôt mind because I knew I wasn‚Äôt planning to stay. No one else really knew I was short term, and not the girl I had just started dating. 

But the loss of the job was more sudden than I expected and I was facing the options of going back home to figure it out, or move in with her. At her request. So we moved in together, and I thought it was a bit of a red flag but the chemistry between us was nothing short of amazing. Well, when we moved in together I was doing a job search in the area, and she wanted me to focus specifically on fed govt jobs for the stability, even though in my field those were going to be very few. 

One other thing that happened right after we moved in together is that I severely fractured my right leg on the trailer hitch of the uhaul we rented. I didn‚Äôt have insurance or money or brains, so I left it to heal on its own. My leg was twice the size of the other for like 8 months and it hurt like hell to put weight on my shin for a long time. But I kept my job search going for all that time, and branched out to other fields and also to civilian jobs. 

I wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere, and our relationship had been progressing really beautifully, with her telling me always that we could count on her financial support. Now, she makes a high 6 figure income and her job is secure, even now. We were not living tightly and she never had to stop buying herself all the silly luxury shit she likes to buy. I never made comments about how she spent her money and was always grateful for the support she gave, which was mostly food. I never asked her to pay my debts or even my phone bill which I eventually had to let lapse.

Meanwhile, we got pregnant, decided we wanted to keep it, lost the pregnancy and then a few months later decided to try again. We got engaged, I was planning to buy our plane tickets to elope with the sale of some assets. Then as that got put on hold, I used the money to give her family an amazing Christmas instead.

Throughout the relationship I woke up every morning at least an hour before she did and made her coffee and breakfast, prepared her lunch, cleaned the cat‚Äôs food and water bowl, woke her up for work, and then I‚Äôd spend the rest of the day cleaning up the house, doing laundry and doing things like groceries for dinners which I cooked, or her errands. She never once had to do anything in the house. She would come home at 2pm from a ‚Äúlong‚Äù day at work, nap on the couch for 4 hours and wake up to homemade dinner on the table, then lounge around and smoke weed until it was bedtime. 

When I met her cat, she referred to him as her roommate. I immediately improved the beautiful boys life. I helped her learn how to comb out his mattes, I changed his feeding area so it would work for him, I helped her identify that he had 5 rotten teeth in his mouth that needed to be pulled. The boy became my son, and we became closer than she‚Äôd ever known he could be. 

I begged her to go up to her mother‚Äôs house every weekend so we could clean up the yard or the hoarding. I installed a sink in her mother‚Äôs washroom because she didn‚Äôt have one at all, I installed a dryer, I fixed her car, her mower, landscaped her front yard. I took damn better care of her mother than she ever wanted to. In fact most times we went up she‚Äôd just hide in the backyard and smoke while I toiled. I made sure to be June Cleaver to her and her family every day we were together. 

At one point, I told her I‚Äôd been more focused on the household than my job search and she gave me her blessing to stop looking for work. That lasted about 4 months because we talked about me managing the household budget and meal planning and she ended up hating that. But also during those 4 months we had so much excess cash to spend. We took a trip to Orlando and stopped at nearly every Buccees along the way and bought something everywhere. I never criticized her spending but she hated just that I would ask, ‚Äúhey honey how do I categorize this charge‚Ä¶‚Äù

So we talked in October and I went back to my job search. We had a beautiful Christmas with many romantic memories and pictures and her absolutely rapturously in love with the gift I gave her, then it was a new year and she was ending the relationship. And the shitty part is, I had two job offers lined up. One of them in my career field.

I feel like I tried to give something of value in return to her, and when she was ending the relationship she held me in so much contempt for not working. Saying that I‚Äôm a grown up and I need to take care of myself, and saying that she didn‚Äôt care about any of the things I did for her, that she‚Äôd be fine living like a slob the rest of her life and eating frozen dinners (her words). None of this contempt existed during the course of the relationship, or she never voiced a single peep of it as she napped and ate my food on plates she never had to clean. She made me feel small, and now to top it all off, she‚Äôs closing me off from the few friends I have here and making every effort to steal all the things I brought into our house. She looked me dead in the face one day and told me I had no rights to our home and she had me illegally kicked out of the apartment and made me homeless rather than try to give me a soft landing to something stable, and now I‚Äôve been displaced for over a month. All this just feels incredibly heartless and cruel, for someone who genuinely tried to fill in the gap in my ability to provide the best ways I know how. I‚Äôm good at making a home, exceptionally good and I gave her a very good home that she never had to work on. I turned her on to crafts and bought her the supplies, I supported her every whim and desire and let it roll off my back when she‚Äôd try to pressure me (an SA survivor) to have period sex. I never put any roadblock on her being with her friends or doing pretty much whatever she‚Äôd like. But I got blamed for her never seeing her friends. She‚Äôd point out the times I wanted her to just give me a heads up so I could pick up around the house, as if I was sayin no. But I‚Äôve never been the type to tell someone they couldn‚Äôt go out, or spend their money any way they choose. I think I tried my damndest to be a good person to her.

What I'm hoping to find is some outdoor area that will A) have good reception B) Have bathrooms nearby (or at least be near a wooded area lol) and C) will be at least somewhat private/secluded. 

  
One idea I had was going to a pavilion/shelter in a park like North Park or Frick Park, but wasn't sure how the reception is, and obviously this would be a Saturday afternoon on a nice day so I assume most things are booked by now. Obviously somewhere like a coffee shop wouldn't work because it'd be too noisy.

  
Thanks, sorry I know this is kinda random but it's a super important phone call and just wanted to find the perfect place to have it! Willing to go anywhere within 30 minutes of downtown in any direction.",0,1746831990.0,pittsburgh,8,0.43,False

Monday, May 4, 1970
I got to the office to help Mark in getting out the petitions to the various candidates and giving them assistance. Some people I know, like Mikey and Rodney, are running for rep. I‚Äôm getting to know a lot of the people in student government, even the candidates for president and vice president.
I was exhausted by lunchtime, but attended a protest rally. President Kneller cancelled classes from 11 AM to 2 PM tomorrow in protest over the new escalation. Some students are planning a strike, and I, for one, hope it comes to pass.
In Psych, we saw a film about behavioral therapy with psychotic children. I cut English and went to SUBO and had a coke with Janet. In Science, Prof. Levine discussed chromosomes and DNA.
‚Äî I just learned that four students, two of them girls, were shot to death at an antiwar rally at Kent State University in Ohio by National Guardsmen.
This makes me so depressed and angry I can‚Äôt express myself very well. Repression is setting in, the stock market is tumbling, and the killing in Asia goes on, and nobody seems to care.
Dad told me after he spoke with Irving Cohen, who bought half of Dad‚Äôs interest in Space Age, that Rhonda said there are ‚Äúominous undercurrents‚Äù on the American University campus tonight.
This week and next are going to be hectic, especially checking the petitions on Wednesday evening.
Tuesday, May 5, 1970
A rough day, but these are rough times. When I arrived on campus at 9 AM, picket lines were up at every entrance and I knew things were coming. Everyone was furious and bewildered over the Kent State shootings.
I was alternately in my office working and attending the biggest rally I‚Äôve ever seen at the college. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the office for too long as the nutty Erica Morton (chief virgin on campus) was the only one there.
A strike was called, and although Dr. Kneller called off classes for two hours, he wouldn‚Äôt support a strike. Suddenly, after the rally, the President‚Äôs office was taken. There was little resistance.
I walked up there and heard a student tell Kneller, ‚ÄúSometimes you‚Äôve got to stick your neck out.‚Äù The President replied, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm sticking my neck out, you‚Äôre crazy.‚Äù
I called home from Dr. Kneller‚Äôs phone, stood on his balcony, pilfered some stationery and sat at his desk. It was unbelievable ‚Äî just like what I‚Äôve read about it.
I went back to the office and talked and rested with Juan and Esther Ng, who‚Äôs a dedicated radical; I‚Äôm going to vote for her and her black running-mate Pam Harvey, although they have no chance of winning.
By now I know so many people on campus, and everybody knows me, even the president of the student body, Phil.
Strikes are on at most city colleges and all over the country, too. ‚ÄúAvenge the Kent State 4‚Äù was written all over campus. The country is getting out of Nixon‚Äôs control. Things are very weird and happening so fast, I need to catch my breath.
Wednesday, May 6, 1970
A cold, hairy day. I relaxed for a change this morning. I did pass by Midwood, which was on strike.
When I did get on campus after 2 PM, I went to the office and did some work. We‚Äôll have to postpone, or as things turned out, cancel the elections.
Mark and I went to a crammed meeting of Concerned Faculty who voted to strike indefinitely. The black and Puerto Rican students want the school kept open, however.
I was in the liberated President‚Äôs office when a bomb threat call was received, and Boylan Hall was evacuated. Meetings were held everywhere: Student Government in SUBO, the strike steering committee at Whitman, blacks at Roosevelt.
Kneller called the Concerned Faculty members ‚Äúunrepresentative‚Äù but called off classes for the rest of the week. Mark and I had to lock our office so that it won‚Äôt be taken over.
Things are pretty confused. Strikes are going on all over the country and there‚Äôs a Washington demonstration scheduled for this weekend. Various people around the campus that I‚Äôve been speaking to ‚Äì Richard Pontone, Esther, Evan and others ‚Äî are not sure of what‚Äôs happening, and neither am I.
Dad‚Äôs Bronx store was closed due to the Fordham demonstrations.
Now I‚Äôm just living day by day. But I wish I had time to reflect on what‚Äôs gone on in the past few days.
Thursday, May 7, 1970
Another day of protest and turmoil.
On campus early, I was chased out of Kneller‚Äôs office by the strike leaders: the liberators seem to be becoming repressors.
Mark and I went to a liberation class with Jerry Sachs, a sociology professor, and we discussed how this whole movement relates to us as individuals.
Marc said Madison was closed, as were most other high schools, and there was a huge high school rally at the Whitman amphitheater. I‚Äôm amazed that they‚Äôre so politically aware.
Michelle Nagel and I went to the Concerned Faculty meeting, and then went with Juan to the mass meeting at Whitman. I left there and went into LaGuardia and rapped with Esther and a black guy, Zeke Clayton, who wore a nameplate saying ‚Äúoutside agitator emeritus.‚Äù
After lunch, I went to the Sociology Department meeting. Sachs rented a bus to Washington and people bought tickets. After considerable discussion, they passed a resolution supporting the strike for the rest of the term.
Tired and somewhat disgusted, I spotted Doris Cohen driving down Flatbush Avenue and she drove me home. I took some photos on campus, but everyone gets touchy about being photographed.
Funeral services were held for Jeffrey Miller, one of the dead Kent students. Some people are using the tragedy to further their own causes.
Of all people, Interior Secretary Hickel called on Nixon to ‚Äúend the war on the young.‚Äù
This week, as Jerry Sachs said, seems three years long. I don‚Äôt like not thinking all this through. I‚Äôm an orderly person who‚Äôs most comfortable with routine living at a chaotic time like this.
Friday, May 8, 1970
And it goes on. Alice and I went to a faculty meeting at Whitman at 10 AM. Kneller spoke, as did one of the Concerned Faculty and a representative of blacks. Not much was accomplished.
We found Howie in the President‚Äôs office (now Strike Central) and walked around campus, and then Jeanne and I went to a workshop. No one knows if police will be sent on campus to break up the strike.
I went to quite a few other meetings during the day, including one of marshals for the Washington march. Esther is working as a marshal, Sheila is working on the clean-up committee, Mr. Feltman is on the Concerned Faculty.
I came home for lunch and returned to the college until 5 PM. The school will be open, but classes are shut ‚Äúindefinitely.‚Äù More departments ‚Äî Chem, Bio, Poli Sci ‚Äî have supported the strike. All public schools were closed today.
Construction workers beat up students in Wall Street and threw rocks at women protestors. This saddens and angers me and does more than all the peace rhetoric to convince me that the strike is right. On campus, there were a few confrontations with YAF, but nothing serious. I wish the strikers were better organized.
Mom and Dad went to a Neil Simon play tonight. A heavy thunderstorm struck ‚Äî if only it could wash away all the world‚Äôs troubles. At Nixon‚Äôs press conference he was oh so sincere, but it won‚Äôt help him.
Saturday, May 9, 1970
A hot day: it hit 90¬∞ and was sunny. I got a letter from Gary this morning. Things seem to be going all right at Fort Polk, although his folder says ‚ÄúPvt. Mary Marcus‚Äù and he said he thought he could get out for being a transvestite.
At the college, the crowds were small. I attended a liberation class held by Prof. Vincent of the Bio Department on how to influence legislators. I took a list of names for a national political action committee.
I met Jeanne as she was leaving and I drove her home. There was a rumor that more of those hard-hat construction workers were coming to the college to cause trouble, but none showed up.
The Washington rally was large and non-violent. The ball may be rolling for some sort of general strike. Nixon met with some demonstrators at dawn, but he may revert to Mr. Mean if this thing goes on.
I relaxed, got a suntan and read James Watson‚Äôs The Double Helix the rest of the afternoon. I got pictures back of O‚ÄôDwyer and the peace rally that seems so long ago; all came out well.
Tonight I went out and talked with my parents, Lou and Evie, and our neighbor Jerry, who works for the telephone company. Evie tells me that Julie down the block is going to Fort Polk this week. Maybe I should give him Gary‚Äôs name.
WBAI gave their excellent coverage of the Washington demonstration again. Free radio like that is good. This was the week that was, but is it an end or merely a prelude of things to come.
Monday, May 11, 1970
A hot, sunny day. Marc went to school, but there was a strike on at Madison and he came home. The Board of Higher Education opened the City University, but President Kneller closed Brooklyn.
Dr. Wouk and I discussed my role in all of this. He‚Äôs pleased that I‚Äôm making excellent progress. His new book, The Right to Lie, has been published.
When I got back on campus, I went into a crowd that included Janet, Effie, Rose and Prof. Levine and heard Abbie Hoffman speak. I never heard so many ‚Äúfuck‚Äùs in my life. The speech was filled with bad logic, revolutionary rhetoric and some humor; I did not applaud with the others.
Hoffman‚Äôs a showman. I doubt if he wants peace and hope not too many are fooled by him.
Then I went to the Spigot office. The SG elections have been officially cancelled. Steve Denker, who appointed me elections commissioner, chaired a meeting that included Juan and Mitch. A quasi-official student government committee was set up to contact local organizations.
I may take Mark up on his offer to join the Spigot staff. Juan told me there are advantages to being nice to Erica: ‚Äúshe‚Äôs very liberal about sex.‚Äù
At home, I spent the afternoon sunning myself and reading The Deer Park. I stopped by the Cohens tonight. Sid and Charlotte Rotenberg reported that Joey wants to quit high school and fight the hardhats. We decided that the best way to express dissent was at the ballot box.
Tuesday, May 12, 1970
A hot, humid day. I spent the morning in the back yard and I‚Äôm as red as a lobster.
They served an injunction on the strike steering committee last night and they fled Kneller‚Äôs office. I walked into the Spigot office and Mark asked me to go around and estimate the percentage of attendance; from what I saw, I figured 20% at most.
I met with most of my teachers, although I couldn‚Äôt find Miss Glikin. Dr. Bonchek sent a letter saying the class will meet on Friday at Hillel. Dr. D‚ÄôAvanzo‚Äôs giving me an A, Benezra and Wachsberger will give A‚Äôs, B‚Äôs and P‚Äôs ‚Äî I‚Äôll probably get the latter.
This afternoon I renewed my friendship with Kjell by staying at his house for a couple of hours. His mother is very nice, like Kjell. Two of his friends came over, and I recognized one of them, Peter, from junior high. (Why is it no one remembers me?)
When I drove Kjell to the store where he works, he told me he‚Äôs joining the Reserves. He invited me to stop by his house often, and I think I will.
In the news, the Senate confirmed Blackmun and may cut off funds for the war. The Liberal Party nominated Goldberg for Governor and Goodell for Senate. Senators Church, Goodell, Hughes, McGovern and Hatfield made a good case for their bill to cut off war funds in a TV special.
I found Peter very attractive this afternoon, and I got the feeling he could also be gay. Am I ready for that kind of relationship? Sometimes I feel an overwhelming need to hold another human being in my arms.
Wednesday, May 13, 1970
A warm, sunny day punctuated by a morning rain shower. I was very dizzy last night and didn‚Äôt get much sleep. Mom spent the day shopping downtown and she got me a Wallace Beery-type shirt.
I had lunch near the college with Howie and Alice, who was on her lunch hour from her job. Howie may get a job announcing the news on Saturdays on a Long Island radio station; he‚Äôs auditioning on the air on Friday. They make a nice couple; it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre in love.
In Boylan Hall, I was walking around and saw that riverrun was on sale. When I told them who I was, they gave me three copies free. The story, ‚ÄúReflections on a Village Rosh Hashona,‚Äù is just the way I wrote it. It was elating to see it in print. I didn‚Äôt let anyone read it, however; it‚Äôs too embarrassing.
I briefly joined Esther on a picket line and went home to lie in the sun and finish the Mailer novel. Morgenthau dropped out of the race for governor. The hardhats and those dandruffy clerks in their Robert Hall shirts were out on Wall Street shouting ‚ÄúU.S.A. alla way.‚Äù
Thank God for Secretary Hickel standing up for the protestors; I made a mistake in opposing his appointment. Agnew was on David Frost, taking a cue from his boss, coming on quiet and sincere. God, sometimes I wonder late at night what would have been had Bobby Kennedy not gotten shot.
Gary‚Äôs mother called and gave me his address so I can write him back.
Thursday, May 14, 1970
A cooler, cloudy day. I woke up late and when I got on campus, Steve said to me that he saw my name on the masthead of the special offset edition of the Spigot. Sure enough, Mark roped me into joining the staff.
I spent three hours typing up announcements for the next special edition, which may or may not come out tomorrow. I lost track of the time and just made it to Miss Glikin‚Äôs class. She said if we want better than a P, we‚Äôll have to do a paper on One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest.
Then I had lunch at the Campus Coffee Shop with Leonard, and we went to see Prof. Levine. You can take a final if you want to; I‚Äôm undecided. The day seemed to go by so fast; when I came home after 4 PM, I saw Bonnie on the porch and absent-mindedly said, ‚ÄúNo school today?‚Äù
I started to write Gary, but there‚Äôs just so much to tell him. Joey was over today with his guitar to hang out with Marc, so apparently he‚Äôs calmed down about fighting the hardhats.
The stock market hit a new low and Vietnam casualties hit an eight-month high.
I‚Äôve got to start on my new novel, an expansion of the stories. Remember how Moby Dick begins ‚ÄúCall me Ishmael.‚Äù Mine starts, ‚ÄúCall me a schlemiel.‚Äù
Lately I‚Äôve been functioning so well, it frightens me. Everything is clicking into place in my life. Things are good.
Friday, May 15, 1970
It remained cool and cloudy. I woke up early and while Mom was in the beauty parlor, I drove around and took Steven to Tilden; there‚Äôs been race friction at the school lately.
Then I went to the camera store and I got back the BC photos from last week, which were uninteresting. I finished writing my letter to Gary; it‚Äôs funny communicating with him like this.
When I arrived at school, Mark was working on the second special edition, which may come out Monday. I went with Leonard to SUBO, where we attended a meeting of the Brooklyn chapter of the Movement for a New Congress. The main campaign in the area is Peter Eikenberry‚Äôs fight to unseat Rep. Rooney.
I had a quick bite and found that the Spigot office had been turned into Strike Central. They even repaired the telephone. I went into the next office and sat around with Mark and the others for a while.
Dr. Bonchek is standing up for his principles, however idiotic they may be, and is giving us a final and two quizzes next Friday. He got so exercised about the whole thing, I thought he‚Äôd have a stroke.
Grandpa Herb came over tonight with a racing newspaper; two of the experts in it say that Space Age will come in third at Monticello tonight. Tonight I drove to 86th Street and everything seemed okay in the store.
Two black students were killed by police at Jackson State College in Mississippi. Everyone is saying we‚Äôre in the gravest crisis since the Civil War.
Remember Mike Brody, the millionaire who wanted to give away his fortune? He‚Äôs now in a mental hospital.
Monday, May 18, 1970
Mark called me early this morning from State Supreme Court downtown and told me to stop by at the college and distribute Friday‚Äôs Spigot. I took the car and did as he told me.
Then I drove downtown to see Dr. Wouk. I showed him my published story and he told me to keep on writing. We spoke about freedom ‚Äî which is, after all, only the ability to make choices. I can now choose whatever lifestyle I want; Dr. Wouk said he can only give me guidance.
We were interrupted by phone calls requesting Dr. Wouk to appear on various TV shows; I guess it‚Äôs because his book is being published today.
From downtown, I drove home for lunch and then went back to the college. I talked with Juan and Leonard and looked in vain for Joe Benezra.
When Mark came back from court, he had some announcements for me to type up and some other chores. I really like him, but he‚Äôs a little peculiar ‚Äî that‚Äôs not a criticism.
Esther came in the office to give me a hug and kiss because I‚Äôm so cute. She‚Äôs trying to scare Mark by telling him she‚Äôs going to win the election and when she becomes student government president, she‚Äôll replace him as editor with me.
A delegation from the college is going to Washington on Thursday to lobby for peace. The South Vietnamese have now admitted they have troops in Laos.
Mom went to work with Dad this morning and in Manhattan she bought a diamond and emerald ring.
Tonight I did my English paper and joked around with my brothers.
Thursday, May 21, 1970
Another warm and sunny day. This morning I got a letter from Mansarde, who told me of the Kent State goings-on in Madison, about her crazy mother who owns 61 pairs of shoes, and about her love for Alexander, who ‚Äúplays the bassoon quite well.‚Äù
I spent from 11 AM to 1 PM in the back yard by the pool, studying for tomorrow‚Äôs Psych final. I didn‚Äôt mind the work, which is very interesting. By 3 PM, I was bored and drove to the college.
Hardly anyone was there: the revolution was called on account of good weather. I did find Juan and drove him to his house on Carroll Street. Juan is very nice, my first Puerto Rican friend.
Dad brought home Mom‚Äôs stunning diamond and emerald ring. Today Dad conferred with his lawyer; they‚Äôre going to meet with Ron Jay next week.
The family went out for dinner, but I had a burger at home. Driving around Flatlands, I passed Jerry Lewisohn‚Äôs house and saw him on the porch. I stopped and spoke to him for a while. He‚Äôs all wrapped up in his work for the LIU radio station.
I got a call from this guy who asked me if I could work on some political action Saturday, and I agreed; it‚Äôll keep me off the streets.
Tonight I watched a Peter Max-designed Fifth Dimension special and stuff. On the news, Senator Mansfield agreed with Dad and Lou: we‚Äôre in a recession.
Friday, May 22, 1970
A hot and humid day. I didn‚Äôt sleep well and had a headache most of the day. This morning I stopped by Kjell‚Äôs and we bullshitted for a while.
On campus, I hung around outside with Esther, Ray and Benny, one of the people from the strike charged with ‚Äúshow cause‚Äù orders.
After I took the Psych final, which was fairly easy, Fran and I went to a sparsely-attended rally on the quadrangle. I ran into Mark and worked with him for the rest of the afternoon.
We went to the Associate Dean‚Äôs office to get the information on how students can appeal their grades, which we‚Äôre going to publish in Monday‚Äôs Spigot. Mark‚Äôs gong on a camping trip to Virginia, so I‚Äôve got responsibility for distributing the paper.
By myself, I went over to interview Dean Breglio, who as yet has not heard the judge‚Äôs decision on the injunction the college filed.
My brothers were off from school today, as the murdered Jackson State students were being honored. Grandpa Herb came over tonight to pick up some pants for Marty.
I spoke briefly to Marty later and heard Jeffrey giggling in the background; I hope to see Jeffrey before he enters the hospital for his eye surgery.
The obstetrician who delivered Mom, Marty and me died today; his obituary was in the Post.
Some idiots ‚Äî from the Jewish Defense League, probably ‚Äì violently attacked pro-Arab people in New York in one of the most revolting incidents I‚Äôve heard of lately.
Monday, May 25, 1970
A dark, drizzly day. I slept well, and this morning Dr. Wouk and I talked about how I set up my parents and make myself dependent upon then. I am scared of being abandoned, which is why I reacted strongly to Jeffrey‚Äôs stay in the hospital.
School was practically empty. I had lunch at the Campus Coffee Shop and then went around to distribute the Spigot and to the library and Student Center. I met Evan, but he was on his way to a Chem final and I didn‚Äôt want to hold him up.
At home, I watched Another World and wrote Gary. I received a letter from Rep. Brasco, who says he opposes the war and supports cutting off funds.
Dad went with his lawyer Stan Goldstein to confront Ron Jay. Jay finally admitted that he never file the Pants Set debentures offer with the SEC. Jay‚Äôs once-luxurious offices are gone, and he‚Äôs now in an old, ratty apartment.
Dad told Ron Jay that he didn‚Äôt want any more excuses, that he wanted him to appear Wednesday with the checks he was given by the Pants Set. But Dad admitted to me that they were taken and doubts that he‚Äôll ever see Ron Jay again.
Tonight I saw What Do You Say to a Naked Lady? at the Brook. I thought it was trash and left in the middle. I just didn‚Äôt see the humor in it; it was just cashing in on people‚Äôs prurient interests.
Arlyne‚Äôs sister said that Jeff was as good as gold when Marty and Arlyne left him alone in the hospital.
The stock market is down again.
Thursday, May 28, 1970
Another cool, sunny day. Mom and Dad celebrated their 21st wedding anniversary today. Mom, of course, got her ring, and she gave Dad jade cufflinks.
They told us not to bother with a present, so we just gave them a card. Mom and Dad said they‚Äôll be going to Las Vegas the end of July.
This morning Mom gave me the car and I drove to no particular destination. After lunch, I went to the college, found no one in the Spigot office and was about to leave for home when I spotted Steve Denker, who invited me to sit in at a meeting of the student-faculty committee on Legal Counseling.
They want to hire a young lawyer to young lawyer to advise students on their legal problems. Present at the meeting were Dean West; Prof. Jones, head of the Office of Economic Assistance; Steve; Phil, the student government president; and Paul Levy, representing GSO, the Graduate Student Organization.
There were disagreements on funding and duties, mostly between Levy and West, and the meeting gave me a headache when nothing was resolved.
Tonight Mom and Dad took the boys to see the new Beatles movie, Let It Be. At home, I began a story called ‚ÄúKenny, Anytime,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not satisfied with it.
I rinsed my hair with lemon juice to lighten it and used the sauna belt and Tensolator.
For the past two days, the stock market has been booming, and I can‚Äôt figure it out.

hate the internet with these

gooner game FFS man.

Like let's just ignore all the sex

""gooner game"". The internet new

the intro of IV, Trevor's

I'm convinced this is because the

I am working on a project for a friend where I am in need of some information that I am having a hard time finding/determining. I did a similar project to this one but with NBA Championship teams, so I am thinking if I explain what I did there, it might make it easier to figure out what I am trying to find for the NHL.

  
Essentially, I took data from every team to win the NBA Championship. I specifically looked for and found the starters for each team in the championship games, as the NBA tracks games played and games started.

  
But I noticed the NHL does not seem to track that same information, and ultimately I am trying to find out which players started each game in the Stanley Cup Finals. I tried looking at some box scores on ESPN, but that didn't help me much, and that would only be data from the current year playoffs. I am trying to find information going back to the early 1990s.

  
If anyone has any advice on how I might be able to find this information I would greatly appreciate it. So I am just trying to find out which players started each of the games of the Stanley Cup Finals for several years, going back to the early 1990s. Thanks in advance!

1kivsf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1kivsf4/from_200_websites_to_10kmonth_mvp_dev_agency_my/,From $200 Websites to $10k+/Month MVP Dev Agency - My Journey,"Hey! Thought I'd share how I went from building cheap websites to running a little MVP development agency making over $10k a month. It's been a wild ride full of pivots and facepalms.

# The $200 Website Hustle

About a decade ago, I was that guy making basic websites for any local business. Friend's bakery? Uncle's plumbing company? I'd cobble together HTML/CSS (mostly from templates), add some stock photos, and boom, ""professional"" website for $200. I was probably making minimum wage hourly, but hey, I got paid to code!

Learned a ton about client work and deadlines. Also learned the hard way about setting boundaries after spending two unpaid weeks on ""just one more small change"" (spoiler: never just one change).

# Site Builders Ate My Lunch

Then one day the inquiries dried up. What happened? Wix, Squarespace, etc. These DIY builders got really good, and suddenly business owners could make their own decent sites over a weekend.

I was in denial at first. ""They'll come back for custom code!"" Nope. Market for basic HTML sites basically vanished. Hard lesson: don't fall in love with your offer, fall in love with solving the right problem.

# The WordPress Wave (Until It Crashed)

Time to pivot! I jumped to WordPress and started offering custom sites. This was when everyone wanted sites they could update themselves. I charged more ($500-800) and business picked up. Became ""the WordPress guy"" in my network.

Then the market shifted again. Clients stopped asking for custom themes and started saying, ""We found this $59 theme, can you just customize it?"" Those templates got really good, and clients didn't want to pay me to build from scratch.

Had a mini identity crisis since I prided myself on custom work. But remembered the lesson: clients don't care how it's made; they just want something that works. Started offering template customization instead. Less glamorous but kept the lights on.

# From Websites to Web Apps

I noticed a trend: while basic sites were going DIY, businesses needed custom web applications that Wix couldn't handle. Dashboards, membership platforms, etc. My chance to level up!

I dove into learning modern JS, Python, databases. My first web app came from a former client needing volunteer management software. I said yes, then frantically Googled everything for two months. Delivered a working app and they happily paid way more than $500.

Eye opener: people pay more for software that solves a painful problem vs. just a website with info. I built more apps, inventory trackers, niche e-commerce sites. Finally charging 4-5 figures per project.

Started consulting on solutions rather than just building. I'd ask what they were trying to achieve and sometimes realize they didn't need a custom app at all. Being honest built trust and brought more referrals.

# Embracing AI & No-Code: Building MVPs Faster

Fast forward to recently. Everyone's talking about Bubble, Webflow, and AI. Initially saw them like I saw Wix years ago, for beginners, not ""real"" developers. But found a sweet spot using them alongside coding to deliver faster.

Started getting non-technical founders saying, ""I have an idea, I need an MVP built fast and cheap."" They didn't care if I used code, no-code tools, or magic, they wanted a working product ASAP. My new niche: MVP development mixing different approaches.

Then AI coding assistants came along. Total game-changer. Like having a junior dev pair-programming 24/7. Tasks that took a full day might get done in a couple hours. Called it my ""secret weapon.""

Now I run a small agency focused on MVPs for startups. Making over $10k monthly consistently. Not yacht money, but a milestone for me. I have full schedule and location freedom. Some days I work from home, other days from a coffee shop or on the go, other days I go to the park with my kids. I choose interesting projects and turn down nightmares.

I have a feeling that this one won‚Äôt last as long as the others, but I‚Äôm always ready for the next opportunity.

# Key Takeaways:

* Stay adaptable. Tech trends move fast. Be ready to pivot.
* Don't fall in love with your solution; fall in love with the problem.
* Use new tools to your advantage. Don't be the ""back in my day"" guy.
* Focus on value, not just tech. Clients care about outcomes, not whether you used React or Bubble.
* Build relationships and trust. Word-of-mouth brought me most opportunities.
* Enjoy the ride. Celebrate little wins, don't beat yourself up over mistakes.

It's okay to change direction. It doesn't mean you failed; it means you're growing. Every skill adds to your toolbox.

That's my story so far. From $200 simple sites to building MVPs backed by AI. Thanks for reading! Happy to answer questions or hear about your journey.",1,1746831478.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,1,1.0,False

**Memory Transcript Subject: Sgt. Evan Teede, UN Armored Combat Engineer**

**Date: September 23, 2136**

Hurry up and wait. The favorite motto of the army since officers were implemented in the army. So basically forever. That was the frustrating part of leading an armor platoon, knowing we could shape the front but waiting for orders to move. For now we were at action ready in the troop hanger of the *UNSS Steadfast.* One of the troop ships in the UN warfleet that hovered over the Cradle.¬†

My men sat atop their tanks trash talking and playing cards while we waited for the airborn to clear us a LZ. The tanks themselves were concerning to me. Not that I thought they were inadequate; no, these Carcharodon AVRE tanks were top of the line. Meaning the UN was ultra serious about this preventive invasion.¬†

Carcharodon AVREs. Engineering tanks built off of the Carcharodon chassis. The British tank was a slightly out of date SIT or Stealth Infiltration Tank. The SIT was to an MBT as an MBT was to a medium tank of WW2. After the conflicts of the mid twenty-first century, forty ton tanks with 120mm cannons became far less practical. So why not take an IFV and fill it with stealth tech, drone warfare tech, the newest semi-railgun weaponry, and non-newtonian armor until you have a whole new beast of a war machine. Hard to pin down with radar, infrared, and even night-vision; defends itself against RPGs or drones; capable striking at a multitude of targets; and armor that could survive most attacks once. Truly a menacing vehicle. Of course, that just led to the invention of ‚ÄúMelta‚Äù bullets (HESH that replaced the HE with a fast acting corrosion agent) and the thinking that caused the Satellite War.¬†

The AVRE version sacrificed all stealth in favor of a higher horsepower engine, a recovery crane mounted on the back, and a bulldozer blade on the front. The crewless turret was also reworked. The 40mm Rail-hybrid autocannon was replaced with a much less balanced (and more fun) 200mm howitzer. We all affectionately referred to it as ‚ÄúGabriel‚Äôs Trumpet‚Äù. The laser defence turret on top, smoke launchers on the cheeks, and four drone launch tubes in the back held over. As well as the 50. Cal coax minigun and remote turret on the hull. We all sat in the crew compartment in the front of the hull. Kind of gave off a Post-USSR tank vibe, if the gun wasn‚Äôt an artillery piece.¬†The hull in general really looked like an ancient Warrior IFV hull if you slanted the sides and squashed it a little. The crane and winch sat flat on top of the engine deck, and the bulldozer blade rested on the top front plate until it was deployed. All in all, a very well equipped tank, but not right for the main armor force. They were using the German Jaguar tanks. Probably the third tank with that name.¬†

As engineers, we of course modified the tank. Mine, the Lynx Grenadier, had a speaker system wired on and what amounted to a sawed-off recoilless rifle strapped to the hull MG. We couldn‚Äôt reload it without getting out of the tank, but it came in infinitely handy during urban combat. Someone (wasn‚Äôt me, I swear) also messed with a selection of the smoke grenades. Most were normal, but about twenty percent were colored and another ten percent glittery.¬†

The higher ups called it out of specs, I called it psychological warfare. Naturally, we painted the name and a cartoon character of a Lynx in a helmet and plate carrier, carrying a grenade launcher on the side. That was what we got the most trouble from surprisingly. The brass said the big cat on the side will scare the locals as being ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù. As if I ain‚Äôt already riding in on a multi tonned death machine.

The things I heard about the Gojid gave me the impression that they had a very obvious and simple weak spot. ‚ÄúPredatory‚Äù material. I was sure I could mess with their resolve, simply by playing some ‚ÄúScary‚Äù music over the speakers. Usually we just used them for around camp and to psych ourselves up in combat, but now we were fighting aliens. Maybe, just maybe.¬†

I wanted to get my feet on the ground and relieve some of this tension from all the waiting and the news reports, but that was still going to be a while. The infantry left less than an hour ago. It would take time for them to land and time to fight the interceptors and time to knock out enough AA for the larger shuttles to drop us off. Might as well distract myself before the drop.

‚ÄúOK, I got a question for you.‚Äù my gunner, Cpl Miller stated while placing a four of clubs on the discard pile. They were playing hundred points since I‚Äôd opted out of any of the games. A good two player game that I suspected was near identical to Gin Rummy.

‚ÄúAnd what is it this time?‚Äù Cpl Harrison, My driver responded tersely. I figured he didn‚Äôt like his chances of winning this hand. The auto-loader and modern technology meant these tanks were fully crewed by three people. No need for a loader or radio operator or such.¬†

‚ÄúHow come the Cradle is auto-translated from their language, when most other planet names aren‚Äôt?‚Äù Miller posed his conundrum. ‚ÄúAafa doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me. Fal, Talsk, and Sillis are all completely alien. Earth isn‚Äôt translated or we would see more jokes about ‚Äòdirt‚Äô or ‚Äòground‚Äô. Even Venlil Prime is only partly translated as far as I can tell. But the Cradle is completely understandable?‚Äù

Harrison was drawing a new card when he froze. I even stopped mid coffee-sip to ponder this.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Harrison exclaimed. ‚ÄúHow does that make sense? How have I never thought of that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you believed me more, you would know I am usually right.‚Äù Miller teased the fellow tanker.

Time for me to join.

‚ÄúI think you are like a fine, old clock. You are right exactly twice a day.‚Äù I said from my seat in the hull. Miller shot me a ‚Äòyou too‚Äô look before trying to change the subject. I guess he didn‚Äôt want to try to outmatch his Sergeant in an insult war.

‚ÄúYou going to play your hand or what?‚Äù The Swiss gunner asked his opponent.

‚ÄúYea yea, here take this one and choke on it.‚Äù Harrison said, throwing a nine of spades on the deck. His Scottish Accent was beginning to thicken with his agitation.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhy thank you, I win!‚Äù Miller responded while picking it up and laying his hand down for inspection.¬†

‚ÄúHow do you have three wild cards?! You‚Äôre rigging the deck!‚Äù Harrison accused.

Miller was barely restraining his laughter. ‚ÄúHOW? You shuffled the deck, remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ARE psychic, I know it!‚Äù Harrison replied while slugging the fellow Corporal in the shoulder.

‚ÄúNo fistfights before deployment you too.‚Äù I chided half-heartedly. A NCO has to balance between keeping order and allowing the regular smack talk of brothers-in-arms.

‚ÄúI could break a bone and get it set before we leave this ship.‚Äù Miller stated sarcastically. ‚ÄúWhy they have us wait around four hours before we can do anything is a mystery to-‚Äù A piercing whistle sounds over the ship‚Äôs intercom, stopping all conversation in their tracks.

‚Äú*All elements of the 20th Royal Engineer Corps, board your shuttles for deployment.‚Äù*

My reaction is instinctual and instant. I press the platoon button on my helmet‚Äôs radio and shout my first order of the campaign.¬†

‚ÄúPlatoon 32! Mount up!‚Äù

‚ÄúBloody jinx you are.‚Äù Harrison mumbled while swiping the cards up and shoving them into a ziploc bag.

Miller slides through the commander's hatch on the front and gets into his seat between me and Harrison. The driver and I get into our positions, leaving the hatches open for the time being.

‚ÄúCharlie and Delta! Board shuttle seven. Beta! You are with me in shuttle six. Driver Forward!‚Äù

The Lynx Grenadier started with a roar and lurched forward towards the ships sitting in the hanger. The treads scratched at the smooth hanger floor before entering the ship and rolling onto a sled. A few quick strap downs and a double check and we were good to go. The platoon sounded off readiness and I reported to the Lt above me. The shuttle doors closed and sealed, and shortly after I felt the ship lift and exit the hangar moving full burn for the planet.

Although we classified it as a shuttle for the operation, I think it was really a small Venlil cargo ship the UN bought off of them. Would still work, but I found it funny that cargo ships this small existed in the space age.¬†

After an eternal ten minutes, I received the message for the next phase that I was waiting for.

*‚ÄúAtmosphere entry complete. ETA till hot drop is T-five minutes.‚Äù*

‚ÄúButton up!‚Äù I ordered over the headset and proceeded to fall down to my seat and seal the hatch above me. The periscopes within it stored as a backup in case the digital displays ahead of me ever failed for some reason.¬†

We sat in anticipation, every bump of the shuttle could be turbulence or anti-air. We didn‚Äôt know and I wouldn‚Äôt feel remotely safe until our armor couldn‚Äôt fall anymore. Before long though, the lights in the shuttle lit up red, and the doors behind us opened up.

Outside, the shuttle would be flying at an ultra-low altitude over several fields that had been selected for the landing. We all braced for the rollercoaster we were about to ride.¬†

*‚ÄúGood luck 32. Give ‚Äòem hell!‚Äù*

3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶Green! The exploding bolts holding the sleds in the shuttle rapidly fired in concordance with a parachute at the back of the sled opening. Beta went out first, then we did. We were yanked out of the back of the ship while it flew away and began to skid and rapidly decelerate on the ground. It took five seconds for the thirty six ton vehicle to decelerate from over a hundred miles an hour to a stop. I slightly envied the regular armor units. They get to drive out of their shuttles instead of being thrown out. But, we needed to be on the ground first to build their landing zone, so here we are.

‚ÄúAll units, report in.‚Äù

‚ÄúIron Kaputt reporting all systems functional.‚Äù Charlie‚Äôs commander said.

‚ÄúHandsome Italian reporting all systems functional.‚Äù Delta‚Äôs commander said.

‚ÄúWhite Tiger reporting all systems functional.‚Äù Beta‚Äôs commander said.

‚ÄúLynx Grenadier reporting all systems functional. All right, LZ appears to be clear. Get free of the sleds and form a column off of me.‚Äù I ordered before switching to my channel with higher command. ‚ÄúPlatoon 32 landed and all units in working order. Where are we visiting first?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood to hear, Sergeant.‚Äù The Lt confirmed. ‚ÄúHardy Company is pinned down at objective Shield. Go there and rearrange the enemy‚Äôs defense.‚Äù

Objective Shield already? Where we hoped to set up logistics? Was the Gojid defense made of glass or paper?

‚ÄúOn our way, sir. Good luck on your side.‚Äù I replied much more professionally.¬†

‚ÄúAs to you. Command out.‚Äù

I relayed the orders and we rolled out of the field and onto the road. Since we had encountered no resistance, I opened the hatch to let some fresh air in and be able to see clearer. I began planning out the route as Harrison stepped on the gas, and the tank sped up to 70 km/h.¬†

It was surreal, sitting in a ready tank listening to the sounds of battle in the distance. I watched the aircraft make strike runs and the distant explosions of infantry-born mortars. It was calm here, but hell waited for us in the distance. And here we were, riding right into the center of it. Whatever, these tanks were needed there. We would get the job done.

**Memory Transcript Subject: Neva, Venlil Space Forces**

**Date: September 23, 2136**

The predators were absolutely insane. Sure I expected them to retaliate against the threat the Gojid posed right now. That simply made sense. But to JUMP OUT of a shuttle into the battlefield was suicidal! Yet I wasn‚Äôt dead! We even captured our first objective easily!

¬†The shock of the Humans completely sidestepping their defences meant that Gojid defence forces didn‚Äôt know what to do and panicked. Most ran away at once, and the remaining followed suit when the Humans advanced. I was barely keeping it together myself now that I was surrounded by predators that were no doubt in hunting mode. Their control was most incredible to not rend me apart too.

¬†That mattered little now though. The next objective was a town that occupied a crossroads. The humans made their way through the walls easy enough, But that just meant we were trapped in here now. The town was designed to ward off Arxur raids with the long site lines and bunkers at intersections. My group was pinned at the end of a road doing our best not to be hit by the plasma guns mounted at the opposite end. We didn‚Äôt dare move as we already lost a couple guys to the fiery booby traps and bunkered down exterminators getting this far.¬†

I watched the squad lead shouting into her radio to be heard over the gunfire. After a scratch or two, she hung up before moving over to talk with us. I tried my best not to flinch at the close proximity.¬†

‚ÄúGood news, the engineers landed and are on their way.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúWe only have to hold here for a few minutes.‚Äù

Engineers? I didn‚Äôt understand how that would help. Were they going to design something that just fixed our situation? My confusion grew as one of my squadmates began his harsh barking laugh.

‚ÄúHAHAHA! They won‚Äôt know what hit them! You know I haven‚Äôt seen one anti-armor weapon here so far?‚Äù¬†

Another chuckled before joining in. ‚ÄúWe just have to make sure they don‚Äôt flatten the town. We still need it!‚Äù¬†

They laughed in what I could only guess was malicious glee for a second before I mustered the courage to ask what they meant.

‚ÄúWhat are engineers going to do that you are more concerned for the town?‚Äù I asked almost too quietly for them to hear.¬†

My squad lead eased my confusion for the squad.¬†

‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt regular engineers. They‚Äôre combat engineers. They do a lot of things, but when the led is flying, all they do is blow shit up!‚Äù

That raised more concerns, but I elected to keep my mouth shut and simply spray suppressive fire for now.¬†

After a little bit of time, I suppose those ‚Äúminutes‚Äù that were mentioned, I heard a rumbling coming from the distance. In short order, I watched a pack of a whole new kind of predator move up the street behind me. Predators of steel. It looked like some amalgamation of construction equipment, troop carrier, and warship. I assumed these were the ‚ÄúCombat Engineers.‚Äù I suddenly felt much more confident in our chances, if a little more scared of the human war doctrine.

The beast stopped from behind the cover and a hatch opened in the front, revealing a human face. Thankfully, my squad lead was aware enough to prevent any more panic in me or the other Venlil.

‚ÄúMASK SERGEANT!‚Äù She bellowed at the man.

‚ÄúRight! Forgot about that!‚Äù he replied and ducked into the machine.¬†

He came back out with a mask on and started the conversation.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù He asked the squad lead.

‚ÄúBooby traps, Urban combat, and bunkered down enemies all just down that road.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt move down it without getting lit on fire. The good news is, we can‚Äôt find any anti-tank weapons. Don‚Äôt think they have them.‚Äù

The predator nodded. ‚ÄúJust go and remove the obstacle?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúJust run up there and flatten ‚Äòem, sergeant.‚Äù She confirmed for him.

‚ÄúGotcha, follow behind us. we‚Äôll handle them.‚Äù His voice got slightly darker somehow. It felt like they were deliberately trying to freak me out.

¬†This sergeant got into the ‚ÄúTank‚Äù and it began to slowly move up and around the corner. The rest of its steel pack following behind it.¬† It was then I began to hear something. Deep, rhythmic sounds. Now I noticed speakers attached to the lead beast. What were they doing? I braced myself as it pushed forward into the fray, the engine growling like it hungered for blood more than the humans. This day was only getting more insane.
