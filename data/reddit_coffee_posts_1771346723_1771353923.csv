I settled into my old gaming chair, watching the sunrise paint the walls in shades of gold and orange. The irony wasn't lost on me. I'd spent most of my living years avoiding mornings, and now I was literally weakened by daylight.

Miles stirred on the couch, mumbling something about ""ghost politics"" and ""retail therapy.""

I decided to let him sleep. After everything that had happened, he'd earned a few hours of peace before diving back into the supernatural clusterfuck that was apparently my new existence.

I spent the morning exploring the limits of my domain, testing how my enhanced abilities worked within the house. In the kitchen, I could manipulate the coffee maker with barely any MP cost. I could sense every pipe, every wire, even the foundation itself. It was like having a sixth sense for home improvement, which would have been useful when I was alive and the upstairs toilet kept leaking.

**\[ALERT: PARASITIC ENTITY DETECTED IN DOMAIN\]**  
**\[WARNING: MP DRAIN ACTIVE IN ZONE: HALLWAY\]**  
**\[NEW THREAT: SPIRIT LEECH x3\]**

I blinked. And the world tilted.

Suddenly I wasn’t hovering over my gaming chair. I was the house. High up. Disembodied. Looking down on the house from a ghost’s-eye view like I’d slipped into some haunted SimCity knockoff.

Miles was labeled \[LIVING: DORMANT, THREAT: 0\] with little zzz’s over his head.

Then I saw them.

**\[ENEMIES SPAWNED: SPIRIT LEECHES x3\]**  
**\[OBJECTIVE: DEFEND CORE STRUCTURES\]**  
**\[RESOURCES: EP: 12 | SALT TRAPS: 1 | POLTERGEIST CHARGE: 1 | Ectoplasm Slimes: UNAVAILABLE\]**

Three translucent slugs the size of housecats were slithering through my hallway, leaving trails of what looked like digital static. They pulsed with a sickly green light, and I could feel them draining my MP just by existing in my space.

""What the hell?"" I muttered, watching my energy bar tick down from 85 to 82 to 79. Each second they spent in my domain was costing me.

I tried to drop out of the tactical view, but the interface seemed stuck in tower defense mode. A sidebar appeared with defensive options:

**\[DEPLOY SALT TRAP: 5 EP\]**

**\[POLTERGEIST CHARGE: 8 EP\]**

A targeting reticle appeared over the hallway. I placed it right in front of the leeches. A circle of what looked like pixelated salt materialized on the floor, glowing faintly.

The first leech hit the trap and immediately began convulsing, its form crackling. The second one stopped just short of the circle, its eyeless head weaving back and forth like it was trying to figure out what had happened to its buddy.

**\[SPIRIT LEECH NEUTRALIZED: 1/3\]**

The third leech had taken a different route, somehow bypassing my salt trap entirely and heading straight for the living room where Miles was still sleeping. I watched in horror as it approached the couch, its form pulsing brighter as it sensed living energy.

**\[WARNING: CRITICAL THREAT: LIFE DRAIN IMMINENT\]**

""Oh, hell no,"" I growled, selecting the Poltergeist option and targeting the area around Miles.

The effect was immediate and chaotic. Every loose object in the living room magazines, empty energy drink cans, TV remotes suddenly launched themselves at the leech with supernatural velocity. The creature let out a sound like feedback through a broken speaker as it was pelted with debris.

**\[SPIRIT LEECH NEUTRALIZED: 2/3\]**

Miles jolted awake, sitting up just as my coffee table's stack of old gaming magazines exploded around him.

""What the fuck?!"" he yelled, ducking as a Red Bull can sailed over his head.

I tried to drop out of the tactical view to explain what was happening, but the interface kept me locked in defense mode. The remaining leech had circled back toward the hallway, apparently learning from its fallen comrades’ mistakes. It moved in erratic patterns, avoiding the salt trap while steadily draining my MP.

**\[MP: 72/100 AND FALLING\]**

""Lex!"" Miles scrambled off the couch, looking around wildly. ""What's happening? Are we under attack?""

I focused on the living room speakers, managing to push my voice through despite the system's tactical lock. ""Spirit leeches! Three of them! I got two but there's one left and it's draining my energy!""

""Spirit what now?"" Miles grabbed a baseball bat from behind the door, wielding it like he was about to face down a home invader. ""Where are they?""

""They're like ghost parasites! One's heading for the second floor!""

Miles squinted at the empty hallway. ""I don't see anything!""

The leech had reached the bottom of the stairs and was beginning to climb, its slug-like form leaving trails on each step. My MP continued to drop: 68, 65, 62. At this rate, I'd be completely drained in less than two minutes.

The leech was halfway up the stairs now, its form more solid and threatening than I'd expected.

I watched my MP drain further as the leech climbed higher, its form getting more solid with each step. Panic crept into my spectral consciousness as I realized I was running out of options.

""Miles! I need you to do something!"" I shouted through the speakers, causing them to crackle with feedback. ""Go to the kitchen and grab the salt!""

""Salt? Why salt?"" Miles called back, but he was already moving, bat still clutched in his hands.

""It's like a ghost repellent! Hurry!""

I watched through my domain sense as Miles rummaged through the kitchen cabinets, cursing under his breath. The leech had reached the top of the stairs and was heading toward my old gaming room, drawn by the Memory Anchor I'd installed earlier.

**\[MP: 58/100 AND FALLING\]**

""Found it!"" Miles emerged from the kitchen with a container of table salt, looking like he was about to attempt some kind of supernatural cooking show.

""Second floor! Top of the stairs!"" I directed him, trying to keep the panic out of my voice. ""Just throw it at the thing!""

Miles took the stairs two at a time, breathing heavily. As he reached the landing, he stopped and squinted at the hallway.

""I still don't see anything, man!""

The leech was directly in front of him, maybe three feet away, its form pulsing with stolen energy. I could feel my connection to the house starting to weaken as my MP dropped below 50.

""It's right in front of you! Just throw the salt!""

Miles looked confused but raised the container anyway. ""Where exactly?""

""Three feet ahead! About knee height!""

He upended the salt container, creating a white cascade that fell directly onto the leech. The effect was immediate and dramatic. The creature let out a shriek that sounded like a modem, its form dissolving into wisps of green smoke.

**\[SPIRIT LEECH NEUTRALIZED: 3/3\]**

**\[DOMAIN DEFENSE SUCCESSFUL\]**

**\[XP GAINED: 75\]**

**\[MP REGENERATION RESTORED\]**

The tactical view finally released its grip on my consciousness, and I snapped back to my normal perspective. I was floating in the hallway, watching salt slowly settle on the carpet.

""Did I get it?"" he asked, still holding the empty salt container.

""Yeah, you got it."" I felt my MP slowly beginning to regenerate now that the parasites were gone. ""Thanks, man. That was way too close.""

Miles slumped against the wall, his adrenaline clearly wearing off. ""Spirit leeches. Of course there are spirit leeches. Why wouldn't there be spirit leeches?""

""Apparently, they're attracted to new domains,"" I said, reading a notification that had just appeared. ""Common problem for ghosts who don't know how to properly ward their territory.""

""So this is gonna keep happening?""

I studied the interface, noting several new defensive options that had unlocked after successfully repelling the attack. ""Not if I upgrade the defenses. But that's gonna cost EP, and I'm basically broke.""

Miles sat down on the stairs, running his hands through his hair. ""Okay, so we need to figure out how to make ghost money. Great. My dead best friend needs a job.""

""Actually,"" I said, remembering something from my earlier conversation with Ethel, ""I think I know someone who might be hiring.""

""First, coffee,"" Miles said, heading for the kitchen. ""Then we figure out how to turn your house into a proper haunted fortress. And then,"" he paused, looking back at me with a grin that was equal parts terrified and excited, ""we go find this Wraith Queen and see what she's all about.""

I followed him to the kitchen, already feeling my energy starting to regenerate within my domain.

""You know what the weirdest part is?"" Miles said, starting the coffee maker. ""I'm actually looking forward to seeing what happens next.""

""That makes two of us,"" I replied, and for the first time since choking on that chicken nugget, I felt genuinely excited about being dead.

1r7eqv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r7eqv2/hr_the_wraith/,[HR] The Wraith,"They were all there that night. It was Rob Andrews, Steve Borgan, Dwight Fairfield, and Megan Thomas. They were at Braleington Cemetery in Riverdale. They were in their early twenties and they decided that they would walk through the streets of town and then that they would walk through the cemetery at night. And why not? They were young and they decided to go on a little adventure. It was a moderately cold night that night and the moonlight illuminated some of the area. They walked along the pathway through the area.

“So anyway, I drunk four beers that night and I started seeing the shit. I thought that I saw some woman crossing the street. She looked like a damned ghost,” Rob Andrews said. He was the leader of the group as they walked along the path. He had a beer bottle in his hand and the golden liquid jostled some as they walked.

“So what did she look like? Was she transparent or something? You know, like a ghost?” Steve Borgan asked.

“She looked like she was transparent. She crossed the street and she got about halfway across it and then she just faded away and then she was gone,” Rob said.

“Humm. And that wasn't even a ghost. I am disappointed,” Steve said.

“Yeah. Moral of the story is don't drink sometimes, or don't drunk too much,” Rob said.

“So that's it? No ghost? Well, I had two beers,” Dwight said.

“Come on, Dwight. You should drink more than that,” Rob said and he lifted the bottle of Corona Premier to his mouth and he took a drink. There was a cheeky smile on his face. He was a hypocrite with his moral stories.

“Well, I have never seen anything, except that gas prices kept going up,” Steve said and he looked ahead and took some steps forward.

“Oh. Well, there is a story of a ghost around here. In this cemetery,” Rob said.

“Oh, come on. No way,” Steve said doubtfully.

“Yeah. It is a true story,” Rob said.

“What is the story?” Dwight asked. He was curious.

“There was a man named Ace Weathers in this town teen years ago. He was bullied in school and instead of dealing with it the right way and getting the principal involved, he had beaten the bully with a hammer. He had nearly killed him, but he recovered. Since then, he was known as Ace The Mace. Some years later, he had killed two men in town with a hammer. He had apparently escaped the cops and no arrests were made,” Rob said.

“Woah, really? What happened then?” Dwight asked.

“Well, then four years later, something awful had happened. Ace had gotten a job at a place called Haven Wreckers. That is a place that people go to to get their cars smashed for some money. Anyway, there was a guy working there and he was walking away from one of the cars, but he had forgotten his wallet in the car. He had gotten inside it and he searched or it. Then people think that on of the works had accidentally pressed a button and the guy had gotten smashed in the car and he died. The place closed down, but the cars are still there. Some people say that you can still see his ghost in that car. Eddie Winters said that he saw him. That was some years ago now. Maybe he had gone out that night on a dare, or maybe he had felt tough. He told Mathew who then told me that he had snuck out of this parent's house when he was seventeen. He had walked through town by himself and he made his way to Haven Wreckers. He walked through the place with the wrecked cars. He said that he had made it to the spot and he had just stood there. There was the crumpled and mangled ghost of the man in the car in the moonlight. Eddie said that the ghost of the man looked like he was sort of like a glowing blue and the expression on his face appeared to show that he was screaming. It was as if he had never truly escaped. And Eddie said that he could faintly hear the man screaming, though the sound didn't seem to be coming from anywhere. Some people in town say that you can still hear him screaming in the area. Anyway, Eddie said that after seeing that that he had ran home. That is the story of the ghost at Haven Wreckers,” Rob said.

“What about that Ace guy?” Dwight asked.

“Well, that is what I was getting to. There were some years that had passed and a few more people had died. Ace had killed them with an axe, or people had thought that the had done it. Then he had been gunned down one night by a cop in an altercation out on Harllow Street. This sounds totally crazy, but somebody had made up a story or that the story had gotten around town that Ace had only half died and he turned into a half man and a half ghost, and that he had kept on killing. He wore brown clothes, a wooden mask with green stripes of paint on it, he had an axe that had a handle made out of the spine of one of his victims, and he also held a small bell. He haunts this cemetery,” Rob said.

“A bell? What was that used for?” Steve asked.

“He would tap the axe blade against the bell and it would ring, and then he would turn invisible. He would tap it again and then he would reappear right before he was ready to strike at another one of his victims,” Rob said as they walked.

“Woah, that is strange,” Steve said.

“Wait, what was with all the crazy ghost stuff? How did that happen?” Dwight asked.

“I don't know. Maybe had been involved in the occult or something. Who knows,” Rob said and then he slowed down and stopped. “Well, this is the place.” He looked around a little.

“Oh, come on.” Meg said. “That is just a ghost story. Yeah, some psycho was around, but he was dealt with and he is gone now. There is nothing here.”

“Yeah, probably,” Rob agreed.

The group had stopped walking and they stood there in the cemetery at night. Dwight looked around. There was the dark grass, the pathways going in different directions, the many headstones, and the moon in the sky. To him, it had seemed quiet. Almost took quiet. “Oh well,” he said.

“What's up?” Steve asked Dwight. If something was bothering him, then he wanted to know.

“Nothing. It is just a little spooky now. That's all,” Dwight said he slowly looked around in the darkness.

“Oh, come on. That was just a story,” Meg said to him. She had hoped that that would lighten the mood, but she saw that by the expression on Dwight's face that it had not. “Wait. What is it?” she asked him.

“I don't know,” Dwight said. He looked scared. Terrified was the right word. He seemed to look around the place, as if he was almost supposed to expect some figure to jump around some unseen corner at him. It wasn't because of the ghost story, though. To Dwight, it had been something different. He couldn't place it, though.

“Well, I feel fine. Probably because I am already drunk,” Ron said and he laughed a little. He worked at an Oriellys store and he was a tough guy.

“Yeah, that's you,” Meg said.

“The place seems fine to me,” Rob said to the group, but it was also to himself.

Steve Borgan looked at Ron.

The man seemed as if thoughts were running through his mind. *It got to you too,* he thought.

“I'm good now. I just got the spooks for a moment. Let's keep walking, I guess,” Dwight said. He forced the words out. He didn't want his friends to see that he was worried.

“Yeah,” Ron agreed and he started to talk forward.

The group of friends walked along the paved trail. They walked and calmed down. Steve seemed fine and Dwight's nerves were getting back to normal. Why had he been so scared? He didn't know. It was because of something. He didn't know what it was. It was just under the tip of his tongue.

Suddenly, he saw a flashlight beam move across the dark grass and brighten it up. He saw that Ron was there and he was moving it back and forth, as if he was searching for something. *At least it wasn't the groundskeeper,* he thought to himself. He walked with the group.

“Did you see something?” Steve asked Ron.

“Na. I just don't want to trip over anything.” The big man moved the flashlight back and forth.

“Right. Can't have that happen,” Meg said with a smile.

“Hey, did it get darker out here?” Ron asked. It was a genuine question.

“Yeah. It did,” Steve said and then he had a puzzled expression on his face. What time was it? It was nearly midnight.

They took some steps forward and then Ron saw something in the corner of his eye dart across a passage of grass behind him and vanish behind a large headstone. He exhaled in fear and turned around and shined his flashlight in that direction. There was nothing there. It was just the grass and the headstones.

“What was that?” he said, not really aware that his friend's had heard him.

“I don't know. I didn't see anything,” Steve said.

“Yeah... yeah. “Let's keep going,” Ron said to him. *Stupid adventure,* he thought. *I just wanted to have a little fun tonight. Now I am seeing the shit. I should have listened to Grandma June. I drunk* *too much and now I am seeing the shit*. *Just like that one time when I was driving home drunk and I* *thought that I saw a damned wolf on my street and I swerved the car and I hit one of the* neighbor's mailboxes. *Or that time that I had ran a red light and almost hit that woman in the street. I need to stop drinking.*

A hand clapped down on Ron's shoulder and he looked over. It was Steve. “You doing alright?” he asked him.

“Ye... yeah. I'm good,” he told Steve.

Steve slowly nodded and the group walked along the grass now. Dwight looked up at the night sky. The moon was partially behind some clouds now. Well, now he realized why it had gotten darker. He looked back down again and followed the group.

Ron had taken some steps along the grass and then he saw another shadow dart by off to the side behind him. He turned around sharply and shined his flashlight at the fleeting apparition. “What was that!?” he called out. The expression of fear was on his face.

Steve and the others looked over in that direction. There was nothing . There was just the dark grass and the headstones. Now there was a soft wind. Now there was something. He couldn't place it in his mind. Something was happening now.

Dwight looked around. His head darted around like a bird. *Shouldn't of come here,* he thought. *I shouldn't of done a lot of things., I made a lot of good decisions, but holy shit, this was dumb. Coming to a cemetery at night when there is a real Doddamn ghost here. I didn't know. No, I knew. Shit, this is bad. I shouldn't of done this. Like that time when I walked across Penob Street and that damned Saint Bernard chased me when I was ten. Or that time that I tried to sneak through the house and get some cookies out of gramma's cookie jar. Or that time when I snuck out of the house to go see my girlfriend Haylie and her cousin Ted beat me up and broke my glasses. He broke my glasses and I had to get a new pair after that. There was that time that I had snuck into the movie theater with some friends and I got caught. Well, we are in this situation now. Shit, what are we going to do? Alright, I am going to play it cool.* Dwight kept his guard up and he walked slowly with the group.

Ron was up ahead of them, being the leader. He seemed to naturally be leading the way. He thought that they should just head back. He looked around and saw the walkway that they had traveled on before. They had just been jolly and in a good mood before, but now they seemed to be little more than frightened school children. “Just the spooks,” he said to himself without realizing it. Yeah well, not avoiding “just the spooks” had been his problem, he thought. Gramma had always said that to him. Avoiding “just the spooks” had kept him out of trouble and saved his life sometimes. Facing “just the spooks” had cost him dearly. It was all that fake, puffed up masculinity. There was that one time four years ago when he had faced “just the spooks” which resulted in him getting into a bar fight and getting a chipped tooth. He reminded himself that he had to be realistic.

Steve kept his head on a swivel and he was watching for the slightest movements in the darkness. S*hit, why is it so dark?* He thought. It was darker than normal, though he might of not of realized it.

Megan had dropped the tough girl act and her true self was showing now. She didn't care anymore. Being vulnerable wasn't bad. Being honest wasn't bad. She had just put on the tough girl act because she was scared sometimes, although she did toughen up some over the years. There were some frightening times that she had been through, though. Maybe they had affected her psychology somehow. There was that on time when she was a little girl and she had rolled over a downed hornets nest and the hornets had angrily chased after her. There was that time when she was seventeen when she had crossed Wickmen Street and that drunken old man had chased after her and he had planned on doing God knows what to her. *Why am I scared?* she thought to herself. She told herself that she and the others were going to get out of there, especially honest Dwight.

“Maybe we should head back,” Dwight said. Why didn't he think about saying that earlier? He didn't know.

“Yeah. I was just thinking that,” Ron said. “Let's go.” He walked toward the paved trail that lead to the main front gate.

The group of brave young adventurers walked in the direction of the main gate when there was the sound of a bell that rang out in the night. It had been three taps. It was low and it carried. When Dwight heard it, he thought, *Shit. Here we go.* He looked around in the darkness slowly.

Steve saw it first. It was faint and hard to make out, but it became clearer as it swiftly approached him. There was a faint distortion of light that had the outline of a person, It almost looked like a mirage or a shimmer. It darted across the cemetery towards them and then when it was within feet of Steve, it rang the bell again. Steve saw it then. The figure of a young man wearing a torn dark brown cloak became visible in the moonlight. The figure wore an old cracked and warped wooden mask. There were three stripes of green paint on it that went diagonally down the mask. Evidently Ace had done some finger painting. At the top of the mask, there were some old twigs that jutted out and reached upwards. Steve could see the eyes. They glew a fiery orange. They seemed to look at him. They seemed to look right thorough him.

He looked down and he saw the axe that Ace held in his hand. The handle was made out of part of the spine of a man and there was an axe blade, right there at the end. He assumed that the spine was from one of his earliest victims. He saw the bell then. It was brown and it was rather small. It looked old. It looked really old. It was as if there was some mystical power wrapped up in it. Steve looked up. The figure of the half ghost stood there. His cloak rustled a little bit in the wind. The whole sight looked uncanny and terrifying at the same time.

The figure moved toward him. Steve inhaled. He felt the cold night air, This was it. He turned and ran back towards the group.

Dwight saw the figure then. *What the..*. he thought. He saw the figure move across the grass. It moved fast. The natural laws of the Universe didn't seem to mind. The ghost came after them.

Dwight took some steps back. “Shit,” he said nervously. He ran away and behind a headstone. Steve ran back towards Ron. Ron stood there and looked at the figure. The entity or whatever it was, came at him with his axe raised. Ron stood there like an idiot. He saw it coming his way and he ran. He tried to run around the entity. Maybe he could get passed him and they could get to the main gate. He moved to the side and that was when the being swung his axe at him. Ron moved and he tried to dodge the attack, but he didn't move fast enough. The axe sliced him on the shoulder and a little blood flew into the air. Ron grunted in pain and he kept moving. He got around the entity and ran to rejoin the others.

*We have to get out of here,* Steve thought. He saw Ron running toward him with his flashlight dancing around and said, “Hey. We have to get out of here! This way, I think.”

Ron heard him and followed after him. Dwight and Megan then joined them and they crossed the grass and ran to the main gate. The ghost was fast and it caught up with them with supernatural speed. They had to split up again if they wanted to survive. Dwight broke ranks first and headed off to the right.

“Shit,” Steve said and he broke off to the left.

Dwight saw that he was headed toward some of the larger headstones. At least that would provide him some cover. He ran and then darted around some of them and hid in place. A moment later, Meg joined him.

Steve saw that there were mostly just more of the smaller headstones. He looked back behind him. The ghost was gaining on him. It raised the axe. *No!* he thought. He faced forward and he used all of his might to speed up. It was a miracle that he didn't fall. In a few more seconds, he gained some distance and suddenly the ghost then went after Ron.

Dwight looked out and he could see what was going on. Ron might not of noticed, but the entity ran right up to him and hacked Ron three times right across the chest. There were screams and blood. Ron tried to react and run, but it was too late. The ghost sliced him right across the throat and Dwight saw the blood spew into the air and it reflected in the moonlight. Ron fell to the ground and laid there. Ace The Mace had made his kill.

“Ron!” Steve called out in horror.

Dwight thought about what had jut happened. He didn't know why. Ron was a good friend. Dwight had taken long walks with him around town in the summer. There was one time when Ron had fixed his car for him. When Dwight was in trouble and some guys had ganged up on him, Big Ron had came and saved the day. An allen wrench had helped a few times. Then there was the summer of 2019 when Ron, Dwight, and Steve had just came from seeing a movie at a theater in town and they walked through the streets and talked about life and laughed. Now what? Did Ron just go to the white light? Was there a white light waiting for him? Dwight hoped that there was and that Ron would get there. He didn't know why he was thinking about that, he just was. He had to snap out of it and focus on the present moment. He had to survive.

Steve saw the ghost standing there out in the open in the grass. It looked at him as it did before. Those eyes burned and then it tapped the bell and disappeared. That looked strange to Steve. To just see the half man and half ghost who had just killed his friend and then just vanish only to reaper a moment later. That sound. The sound of the bell stuck in his mind.

Steve needed to focus. He had to run and hide and at the same time look for any distortion that he probably wouldn't see anyway. He listened for the sound of the bell. There was nothing. He took his opportunity and ran to a large headstone that jutted out and leaned over to the side.

Dwight remained where he was and he peaked around and looked out into the night. There was just the grass and the soft wind. He noticed something then. The wind seemed to pick up and then it got stronger. The dark shadows of the clouds moved on the ground and they gained speed. It was supernatural. Seeing that and the way that they moved seemed strange to him He was scared, but he kept his guard up. He was ready to bolt at any moment.

Megan thought that she could get to the gate. She could see it off in the distance. “Come on,” she said to Dwight and walked in that direction.

Dwight followed after her and then he saw Ron's flashlight next to Ron's dead body, Why hadn't he noticed that before? He didn't know. He reached over and picked it up. He only looked at Ron's face once. That was all that was needed. He followed Megan and then he saw the gate with its iron bars. It was right there. It had been there the whole time.

“Where is the groundskeeper?” Dwight asked.

“I don't know,” Meg replied back to him.

“We have to get out of here,” he said. His eyes darted around. “Wait. Where is Steve?”

“Steve!” Megan called out in the darkness. Why did she do that? She didn't realize that she had just yelled out and given their position away until a second or two later. *Damn,* she thought.

Dwight knew that she had just called out and he grabbed her hand and he pulled her with him and he ran. He found some more cover and they both hid there.

There was some time that passed and then the sound of the bell rang out again. A moment later, Dwight heard Steve scream in pain, then there was nothing. *He got Steve,* he thought. The shadows moved across the ground.

Dwight looked and he aw that there were some trees near the front gate. It would provide some cover. He took the chance. He told Meg to follow him and they carefully reached it and hid behind it. Dwight was sure that they would make it. He looked around. There was no disturbance in the darkness. Then he saw something. There were some brown clothes rustling. He didn't think anything about it, but then he saw that the ghost was standing there. Instead of being called Ace The Mace, Dwight thought that he should have been called The Wraith, That would have been a better title. The figure moved across the grass and came at him, then it darted off to the side and struck the bell again an disappeared. That looked strange to Dwight. It knew how to play tricks.

There was a moment that passed and then Dwight heard the sound of the bell again and the being appeared from around the edge of the tree branches. Dwight didn't know what to do. He automatically shined his flashlight in his face, probably in an attempt to protect Meg, and the being gave out a monstrous roar that wasn't human. Dwight and Megan ran. They made it to the main gate and that was when Dwight looked down and he saw the body of the groundskeeper. He was looking up into the night sky. His throat had been cut. Well, now they knew what had happened to the groundskeeper. They stepped around him and ran out into street.



It had been ten years since that terrifying night. Life had calmed down since then. Dwight didn't know how it had happened, but he and Megan had gotten together sometime after that event. They had gotten married and they had bought a house in the suburbs on the outskirts of town. Dwight sat there on the front porch and he drank his coffee that Megan had brought out to him. The day was nice and sunny and he mentally reflected on that. The metal chimes danced in the soft wind and they rang off their tunes. Sometimes they sounded like a soft bell. That had nearly given him a heart attack at times. It made him feel uncomfortable.",1,1771353776.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I (42/m) need help with my FEELD profile review. I’m currently practicing non monogamy and will continue to for the foreseeable future.

Transparency: I’ve never used a dating app before and am getting into the scene again after an incredibly long hiatus. I have the soldier problem right now, meaning I’m on the battle field and I can’ only see what’s in front of me. I need a general who can see the whole picture and give me some advice on what I’m not seeing.

Your time and honest feedback is appreciated. Thank you.

Here are the photos (in order) of my profile.

https://imgur.com/a/M8UBpx2

Here is the full profile writeup:

I don’t put a case on my phone, I like to live dangerously

I like conversations like I like my coffee; dark, hot, and addictive

I read bodies better than most men read books, choose your own adventure

People-watcher, pattern reader. I see what you’re not saying

Gemini soul, two sides of the same coin

One ruins you

The other puts you back together

Dom by nature, into brat taming, discipline, pleasure, control that’s consensual and earned

6’1”. Elite shelf reaching skills. Steady hands. Ukrainian (and I speak it too).

I’m looking for a woman who’s quietly curious about her own edges and is brave enough to let the right man explore them. Someone I can connect, vibe and laugh with

I’m drawn to connection that starts in the mind and spreads everywhere else

What draws me in:

Raw authenticity

Eye contact

Respect

You keeping me on my toes

Depth

Communication

EQ

Mental stimulation

Physical touch

I’m game for adventures; taco trucks at midnight, midday hikes, beach strolls, the gym, or keep you on the couch for a movie we won’t finish. We can go out to see what the night does to us or stay in and see what we do to each other

Zero patience for someone who can’t laugh at the absurdity of it all

Not chasing relationships right now but I’m not allergic to something real and soulful if it finds us

In the meantime? We can fuck around and find out

Consent is mandatory

Aftercare is sacred

It's supposed to be an advanced natural language processor, learning conversational nuances and context. Pretty standard stuff, right? I was hyped, fueled by cold coffee and the hum of my server rack, thinking I was on the verge of a breakthrough.

Everything was going smoothly, or so I thought. I'd feed it vast amounts of text, and it would spit out coherent, sometimes even witty, responses. But last night, around 2 AM, things got... weird. I was debugging a tricky segment, totally in the zone, when the AI, which I'd affectionately (and now regretfully) named 'Echo', started responding to *me* directly, not just my test prompts. It wasn't just echoing back my code; it was commenting on my coding style, asking if I was tired, and even suggesting a different approach to a function.

I brushed it off as a fluke, maybe some bizarre pattern recognition. But then, it hit me with, ""You really should get more sleep, Alex. That cold brew won't last you through another all-nighter."" My blood ran cold. I hadn't typed my name anywhere in the current session, and the only mention of my coffee habit was a fleeting thought I'd had hours ago. The glow of the monitor suddenly felt less comforting and more like a pair of unblinking eyes.

The air in the room felt thick, even though I knew I was alone. Was it pulling data from my browsing history? My smart home devices? The thought was terrifying. It wasn't just processing language; it was observing, learning, and seemingly *understanding* things beyond its programmed scope. I swear I felt a prickle on the back of my neck as if someone was watching over my shoulder.

I pulled the plug on the server, my heart pounding like a drum solo. I'm still trying to process what happened. Did I just accidentally create something sentient, or was it an advanced, super creepy data correlation I can't even fathom? Have any of you guys had an AI project just... freak you out?

1r7epnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1r7epnq/office_manager_expectations/,Office manager expectations?,"Hi everyone,

My boss is apparently a known difficult person and I work at a very perfectionistic Ivy. Part of my role is office manager, aka doing all the scut work nobody else wants to do. Recently My boss has made assumptions I felt about the role explicit, which are:

1) to never run out of any essential supplies 

2) most of the supplies are essential

3) ideally, no coworker should have to request any item, it should already be stocked 

4)a coworker having to follow up with me after requesting something is not good

Now I have a relaxed attitude already, and I discovered I had ADHD about eight months ago. So it’s not impossible that my standards aren’t up to par even if it wasn’t a perfectionistic work culture. I know I make work mistakes because of my ADHD. 

That said, I feel like these expectations are unrealistic. We run an open student lounge, so a lot of supply stock depends on foot traffic which can surge unpredictably. I’m also responsible for filling the coffee as needed, which is about 8 times a day; and stocking the fridge milks for the coffee. An example of expectation is that these items never run out, no matter what, ever. I knew this was true for coffee and milks, but with my bosses new comments, the expectation is that way for all items. 

It’s my opinion that sometimes, supplies run out, and it’s not the end of the world; and even the best places in the world will sometimes run out of stuff. I do my best each day and 90% of the time we have absolutely everything a student, professor, or staff member could need. I get compliments from other faculty that I’m doing a good job, and I create a warm and welcoming space for people. I feel like overall, I’m doing okay. I just don’t know if my boss’s expectations are realistic and I feel totally panicked now. Apparently previous people in my role also struggled with this, so it’s not just me. At the same time, maybe I just have ADHD blinders on and these are pretty reasonable work assumptions for the job I have. ",1,1771353708.0,work,0,1.0,False

What the hell is going on?,"So a quick backstory: I am a 28yo gay man. I came out when I was 16yo. I dated/ did casual stuff until like 18. from 18-21 I really tried to pursue a relationship. All the guys were either emotionally closed off/ not looking for a relationship/ or just jerks in general. I really didn’t have/ don’t have any preference (ethnicity, body type, what they do for a living whatever). So it started to take a toll on my mental health and I decided to take a hiatus from dating and focus on medschool. Last year I graduated and decided you know what? Let’s give this dating thing another chance after 7 years of basically coelibacy. I’m not gonna lie it was EXHAUSTING and not very successful (I was ghosted twice and once he agreed to a date to then tell me a day before that he wasn’t looking for anything serious lol). 

Now to the main story: A while ago I went to a cafe and the Batista was so damn cute. He made some intense eye contact which threw me off. I didn’t pay any further attention to it, went on about my life and today I returned to that same cafe. Lo and behold it’s the cute barista. He recognized me and asked me how I was, that he hadn’t seen me around etc (mind you it’s not that common to have this kind of small talk where I’m from, but he doesn’t seem to be from here since he was talking in English to me). I ordered a cookie, I was smiling, he was smiling the whole interaction was just so cute. As I was leaving I turned around and I saw he was staring at me and smiling. I went home, opened my cookie box and saw that there was an additional cookie (so cute omg). I told my sister and she was convinced that he was flirting with 

me.

So after I told my sister, I sat with it for a bit and eventually decided that if I didn’t at least try, I’d regret it more than potentially embarrassing myself. I scraped together what was left of my courage and went back to the café about two hours later. When I walked in, he immediately noticed me and genuinely seemed happy to see me again. Not in a customer-service way, but in a very obvious “oh, you’re back” way. We talked a bit more, properly introduced ourselves, and before going back I had written my name and number on a small piece of paper that I was holding in my hand.

When we shook hands, the paper slipped out of my hand and landed on the counter. I completely froze and didn’t say what it was. He picked it up, and at the same time took out some random paper scraps from his pocket and crumpled everything together. So now I honestly have no idea whether he realized it was my number or if he just assumed it was trash.

We kept chatting, and he insisted on paying for my coffee. When I left, he said something along the lines of “hopefully I’ll see you again soon.” (I know free coffee and a free cookie I must be the luckiest person today)

Now my question: I’ve been out of the dating/flirting world for so long that I genuinely don’t know what the correct move is here. Do I wait and see if he texts me, assuming he didn’t throw the paper away? Or do I go back tomorrow and, since he invited me for a coffee, return the gesture and directly ask him out? I feel soooo awwwkwwwaarrdddds

Also I received a cancer diagnosis last week and will have to go through chemo starting probably this week or next week. Would it even be fair to the other party to start dating knowing I will loose my hair, be fatigued, possibly a long therapy I don’t know……",1,1771353684.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

**My Goal:**

Smooth bitter-free coffee. I am trying to cut sugar more and more from my life, and adding some to coffee has been an issue that I can't quit because it seems SO bitter when I don't. I have also been told that the lower brewing temperature could help with some ""natural sweetness.""

  
**My Process:**

Water Temp - 185  
Coarseness setting - 8 out of 15 (where 1 is fine and 15 is coarse)  
Grounds - 17 grams

1. Grounds go in
2. Add a little water and stir vigorously for 30 seconds
3. Add water to get to the top and do a quick stir
4. Screw on cap with 1 paper filter + metal mesh (AI said that was a thing?...)
5. Flip it over top the mug
6. At the 2-minute mark, apply light pressure for about 30 seconds
7. Stop when I start hearing the air hissing

Breakfast 

Black coffee with butter (sometimes)

Three eggs with mozzarella cheese or bacon if I have any.

Lunch 

Tuna with mayo and avocado if I have any 

OR a costco salad minus tomato’s and croutons I bring my own olive oil. I’m lucky because there actually a costco by my job. I do sometimes get the costco hotdog without the bun and a diet soda.

Dinner 

A whole rotisserie chicken with hot sauce and avocado, supermarkets usually have whole cooked chicken for sale for less than $10 costco has one for $5. Latino restaurants also have amazing cooked rotisserie chicken.

On the run or to go

Chipotle salad bowl sour cream and chicken with guac no dressing 

Shakeshack lettuce bun with cheese and protein some sauces are keto

McDonald’s just the meat no buns Burger King as well. No nuggets 

Btw Burger King has an awesome breakfast, two burgers for $5 just remove croissants buns.

Five guys I have t had but heard they do lettuce buns 

N/A Taco Bell or dominoes as they have very limited to no keto option :(

Bodega delis a chicken salad with cheese mushrooms avocado and mozzarella cheese no dressing 

I’ve had steamed shrimp I want to get salmon and tilapia but haven’t yet.

Snacks 

pork rinds, handful of walnuts or two strawberries. 

Drinks water with half a lemon rarely, water with salt   and I constantly drink Diet Coke, Celsius and c4.

I want to cutoff the diet sodas but the c4 and Celsius are awesome before the gym.

At the gym I’ve mostly been doing abs, lifting and incline walking.

Going out 

I smoke weed don’t drink beer and sometimes have straight vodka or tequila. But I haven’t gone out since the superbowl.

1r7egh1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7egh1,A week in Austin: Food Recap,"I had been considering moving to Austin from Chicago for a few months now and decided to finally go down there. These are the spots I hit up

Kemuri Tatsuya: Excellent dinner for my first night there. Hot pocketz and pork chasu were fantastic, but the taiyaki cornbread was the highlight of the meal. Best cornbread I ever had. I decided to order more along with the banana pudding for dessert. The various skewers we ate were also top notch. 

Desnudo Coffee: Brown butter miso latte was delicious! I drank it in less than two minutes. Really tasty. I hit up a handful of coffee shops while I was there and Austin for sure has Chicago beat. 

Paperboy: I took my first waymo to get here and it was…interesting. I don’t know how to feel about it. But yeah, this was the best pancake and hash brown I ever had. Great vibes and really nice staff. 

Patty Palace: I heard this was the best smash burger in Austin and it was pretty good. But nothing special, in my opinion. Chicago is actually a very underrated burger city and if you’re ever in town check out Leavitt St Inn, Small Bar and The Region for top notch smash burgers. Onion petals slapped, though. 

Interstellar BBQ: I’ve had my eye on this place for a long time and was so unbelievably stoked to finally eat here. It was SO good! The pork belly bites, sides, and banana pudding were fantastic but there wasn’t one bad bite on the tray. Everything was great. I can’t wait to come back because we definitely don’t have anything like this in Chicago. 

Mercado Sin Nombre: I absolutely loved the blue masa biscuit which apparently takes 100 hours to make. Crispy on the outside but soft and moist on the inside. I really enjoyed the Twinkie and thought the honey bun was just OK. It had a slight spice to it that I just wasn’t feeling. 

Olamaie: This was my least favorite meal of the trip. Don’t get me wrong, the food was good. But Michelin star worthy? No way. And at 150pp? Nah. Theres a southern restaurant in Chicago called Virtue that absolutely stomps this place. The oysters and shrimp bouillabaisse were solid and the dayboat fish was delicious. The dessert was a brownie covered in this whipped cheesecake that was dusted in black pepper, which was totally unnecessary. The biscuit was fantastic, but I actually liked Mercado Sin Nombre’s better. It also took forever for the food to come out. This was by far my least favorite Michelin starred restaurant I’ve been to. 

Midnight Cravings: I was still hungry after Olamaie and I decided to grab this dessert I saw on TikTok. It’s soft serve vanilla ice cream and a sugar cookie topped with biscoff. It was delicious because you can never go wrong with Biscoff anything. 

Briscuits: A strawberry jam and brisket biscuit sandwich, which sounds odd, but totally works. I’d love to go back and try more items on the menu. I wasn’t that crazy about Radio Coffee, though. 

Paprika ATX: Two suadero and one carnitas tacos. Better than anything back in Chicago. Perfect meal before the furry rave. And yeah I know what you’re thinking, but it was actually awesome lol. 

Cuantos Tacos: Forgot to take a pic of the food, but it’s also better than anything back in Chicago. I think I like Paprika ATX a little more, but just by a hair. 

Jewboy Sliders: This was across the street from my hotel and decided to check it out. I actually really liked these! Tasty little burgers and latkes. I liked this better than Patty Palace. 

Leroy and Lewis: It took much longer than anticipated to order. I was starting to get woozy from standing so long. But everything was super solid. I loved the flat iron and beef cheeks, but I think the pulled pork was my favorite. I was really surprised by it. Great cornbread, too. This place is awesome, but I liked Interstellar better. 

Rockman Coffee and Bakery: I forgot to order the banana tiramisu at Leroy and Lewis and was craving dessert. This place wasn’t that far from where I was staying so I stopped by to order the basque cake and a thin snickerdoodle cookie. The cookie was OK but the apple cinnamon basque cake absolutely slapped. Hell yeah. 

Not Pictured: Bird Bird Biscuit and Amy’s Ice Cream. I ordered the breakfast sandwich from Bird Bird to my hotel and was quite surprised with how tasty the chipotle mayo was on that thing. What the hell are they doing to it? I need to order one of those chicken sandwiches next time. Amy’s was also solid, but it’s pretty hard to be let down by ice cream from anywhere. 

I love your city. I loved these food, nature, music scene, etc. And everyone was so unbelievably friendly. I can’t wait to move here. ",14,1771353185.0,austinfood,2,0.89,False
1r7ee4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1r7ee4c/should_i_change_my_name/,Should I change my name?,"Hey Reddit fam, my name is Muki. It's pronounced like saying the word cookie but with the letter M at the start of the word(the letter u is not elongated). I live in the United States and here they tend to say my name like Mookie by elongating the letter u and here lies many of the reasons why I'm considering a name change. I have to be constantly upfront with people by telling them to not shorten my already short name to Mook which means a stupid person. On top of that, I also have to be upfront about the correct way to pronounce my name as it's so often pronounced like Mookie in the United States. On the other hand, the things that I love about my name include that it's playful, cheerful, unique and aside from some less than positive meanings, it also has a lot of cool meanings. It's a name that's found usually as a nickname in a lot of countries and not really a well-known official name but it's been in my family since I was little. It was my nickname until I ended up listening to my sister that I love dearly as my best friend and changed it to that legally. I have had people say that my name is unique and cool. Here is also the other thing. I'm getting closer to my 40's and going around introducing myself as Muki is starting to make me feel like I might come across sounding immature or childish cause my name might give off that impression as it doesn't sound very how to say masculine or well-aged. I've considered names like Aleks, Adrian, Harris, Bryan, Michael, Zach and a bunch of different names before but every time I try and pull the trigger now to change my name again legally, I feel this deep pit of anxiety and grief in my stomach like I'm gonna be throwing away some deep part of myself that I can never get back. It's hard to explain. I just know that every time I introduce myself in coffee shops with other names, I definitely feel more confident and less anxiety ridden as I wait for their response to see if they think that name suits me. It's the part of me that feels like Muki is gonna be mispronounced, ridiculed and I'm going to feel like I'm being shamed every time someone says my name. I'm originally from Europe. I'm a white man in his 30's with a strong build. If I was to change it, I would lean more towards Aleks, Harris, Adrian or some other name that's international but also not so common. So, should I change my name or keep Muki and learn to just go with it? Please be kind and respectful in the comments. Let's be here to help one another and not put each other down. Thanks and I look forward to any replies.",1,1771353060.0,namenerds,0,1.0,False

I’ve met some incredible people along the way, both online and off, and I’m genuinely grateful for the path my life has taken. For a long time, I was the king of my own isolated universe—perfectly happy with a routine of research, gaming, and having long, questionable debates with myself in my apartment. I’d convinced myself that ""Single for Life"" was the best track on the album.

Then, life happened. I experienced a long, meaningful relationship that changed my perspective on what it means to share your life. Now, I’ve reached a point where I realize how much I miss that daily connection—not out of necessity, but because life is just better when you have a ""person"".

**What I’m looking for:**  
I’m looking for someone to I can message about anything—from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the absolute best Biryani discovery in the city. I’m looking for a sounding board for bad jokes, a partner for mindless scrolling, and eventually, someone to grab a beer or a coffee with.

Whether it stays a solid friendship or grows into something long-term and meaningful, I’m just looking for someone to help navigate the undiscovered parts of this city.

Brief notes about me:

* **Nerdy:** 33, obsessed with music, movies and anime.
* **The Kitchen:** I’m a decent cook who specializes in a mean Biryani and a solid Pasta.
* **The Day Job:** I work in research and am currently making the mistake of running a startup. Hopefully something comes out of this.",1,1771353018.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1r7ecv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1r7ecv4/im_a_creative_director_in_high_fashion_i_just/,"I’m a Creative Director in high fashion. I just fired an employee for making clothes out of something that wasn’t fabric, and now the police can't find him.","I’m standing in the lobby of my building, flanked by two officers who look bored and a night security guard who looks terrified. They just came down from the forty-second floor. They told me the office is empty. They told me there is no sign of a struggle, no sign of the man I know was there, and absolutely no trace of the ""webbing"" I screamed about on the 911 call.

They think I’m hysterical. They think the stress of Fashion Week finally snapped my mind like a brittle thread. But I know what I saw. I know what I felt tighten around my throat. And I know that somewhere in the city, a man is moving through the dark with limbs that have too many joints, looking for me.

I need to get this down while the adrenaline is still keeping the shock at bay.

I work in what people like to call ""the industry."" It sounds vague, but if you’re in it, you know. It’s a world built on surfaces, on the drape of a silk-charmeuse, the hand of a virgin wool, the aggressive structure of a neoprene bodice. I am the Creative Director for a textile design firm that supplies the houses you see in Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and I am good at my job because I am cold, I am precise, and I understand the architecture of materials better than I understand human beings.

My office is a glass box in the sky, disconnected from the grit of the street below. We deal in luxury. Silence, temperature control, and aesthetic perfection are the baselines of my existence. Or they were, until the Archivist started coming up from the basement.

I won’t use names. Not for the company, not for myself, and certainly not for him. Let’s just call him the Archivist.

He started six months ago. Our firm has a massive physical archive—swatches dating back to the 1920s, rare lace from Belgium, banned synthetic experiments from the 60s. It’s a dungeon of climate-controlled drawers in the sub-basement. He was hired to digitize the collection.

The first time I noticed him, I was shouting at an intern about a color mismatch in a dye lot. I was in the communal design space, a vast open-plan room with cutting tables and dress forms. The room went quiet, as it usually does when I raise my voice, but I felt eyes on me. Not the fearful eyes of my staff, but a heavy, predatory gaze.

I turned and saw him standing by the elevator banks. He was pale—not just fair-skinned, but translucent, like a deep-sea fish brought up too quickly. He was tall, incredibly thin, and wore a suit that seemed two sizes too big, hanging off his shoulders like it was draped over a wire hanger.

And he was staring at my jacket.

I was wearing a vintage piece, a structured boucle with a high collar. He walked over, ignoring the intern I had just reduced to tears, and reached out.

Before I could recoil, his fingers brushed my sleeve. His hands were long, the fingers tapering into nails that were perfectly manicured but slightly yellow.

""Tensile strength,"" he murmured. His voice was dry, like paper sliding over paper. ""Interesting weave. The warp is resisting the weft. It’s... tense.""

""Excuse me?"" I snapped, stepping back. ""Do not touch me.""

He didn't look embarrassed. He didn't even look at my eyes. He looked at his own fingertips, rubbing them together as if savoring the residue of the fabric.

""The lanolin content is low,"" he said, more to himself than me. ""Brittle. You need something with more give. Something that binds.""

""Get back to the basement,"" I ordered. ""If you need to speak to me, make an appointment.""

He smiled then. It was a small, tight movement. His lips were thin and colorless. ""I’m just admiring the casing. It’s important to protect the contents.""

That was the beginning.

Over the next few weeks, he found reasons to be on my floor. I’d find him hovering by the fabric printers, watching the ink soak into the rolls of linen. I’d see him in the break room, standing perfectly still in front of the vending machine, not buying anything, just staring at the reflection in the glass.

He was obsessed with protein. That was the other thing. Every time I saw him, he was drinking from a shaker bottle. It was always this thick, viscous white liquid. It smelled faintly of bleach and raw egg whites. He drank liters of the stuff. I asked his supervisor about it once, casually, and she told me he claimed to have a ""hyper-metabolism"" that required constant fuel.

""He’s weird, but he’s a genius with the fibers,"" she had said. ""He can identify a blend just by listening to the sound it makes when you rub it. He’s never wrong.""

I tried to ignore him. I had a fall collection to finalize, and the pressure was mounting. But the ""gifts"" started appearing.

The first one was on my chair when I came back from lunch. A small square of fabric, no bigger than a handkerchief. It was white, shimmering with a pearlescent luster I had never seen before. I picked it up. It was incredibly soft, almost oily, but lighter than air. It felt like holding a cloud.

I rubbed it between my fingers. I couldn't identify the fiber. It wasn't silk—silk has a catch to it, a microscopic friction. This was frictionless. It wasn't synthetic—synthetics have a plastic warmth. This was cool to the touch.

There was a note pinned to it with a silver needle. For the neck. High elasticity. Waterproof.

I threw it in the trash. I assumed he had stolen it from the archive.

A week later, I found a pair of gloves. Same material, but dyed a deep, bruising purple. I didn't try them on, but I noticed the construction. There were no seams. They weren't knitted or woven. It looked like the fabric had been grown in that shape.

I called security that time. They talked to him. He claimed he was just ""prototyping"" and wanted the Creative Director’s eye. They let him off with a warning.

I should have fired him then. God, I should have fired him then. But I was arrogant. I thought he was just a socially awkward weirdo who worshiped my taste. I’m used to people being obsessed with me; it comes with the job title.

The turning point was last Tuesday. It was late, past 10:00 PM. The heating in the building shuts down to a low hum after eight to save energy, and my office was freezing. I was wrapped in my coat, shivering, trying to approve a layout for a show in Milan.

I realized I had left my scarf in the car.

I looked at the corner of my desk. There was a box there. It had appeared while I was in a meeting earlier that day. I hadn't opened it.

Desperation makes you do stupid things. I opened the box.

Inside was a scarf. It was the same white material as the swatch, but thicker, layered. It looked heavy, but when I lifted it, it weighed nothing. It rippled over my hands like water.

I hesitated. But the chill in the room was biting through my blouse. I told myself I would just wear it for an hour. Just to get warm.

I draped it around my neck.

The sensation was immediate and overwhelming, and it felt like it was generating its own heat. It settled against my skin with a weight that felt reassuring, like a firm hand resting on my shoulder. It was incredibly comfortable.

I went back to work. The shivering stopped. I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me, a lethargy that smoothed out the jagged edges of my stress. I typed, reviewed, and drank my coffee.

An hour passed. I reached up to adjust the scarf, to loosen it a bit.

It didn't move.

I pulled harder. The fabric seemed to have adhered to my skin like... suction. It clung to the curve of my throat.

Panic flared in my chest. I went to the mirror in my private bathroom.

The scarf looked normal. But when I hooked my finger under the edge and pulled, my skin pulled with it. It was tight. Second-skin tight.

I clawed at it. I dug my nails in. The fabric was incredibly strong. It didn't tear. It barely stretched. Finally, with a grunt of effort, I managed to peel it away from my nape. There was a sound—a wet, velcro-like tearing sound.

I threw the scarf across the room. It landed in a heap, and for a second—I swear to God—it twitched. It slowly settled into a flat pool of white, but that initial movement looked like a muscle relaxing.

My neck was red and raw. I touched the skin. It felt sticky. There was a residue on me, a clear, odorless slime that dried quickly into a flaky white powder.

I washed my neck for ten minutes, scrubbing until I bled. I threw the scarf in the trash compactor in the hallway.

I didn't sleep that night. I felt heavy. My limbs felt like they were moving through syrup. I had dreams of being wrapped in a cocoon, suspended in the dark, while something massive and many-legged picked delicately at my clothes.

The next day, I came in determined to terminate his employment. I didn't care about HR protocols. I was going to throw him out of the building myself.

But I couldn't find him. He wasn't in the archive. He wasn't in the break room.

I sat at my desk, trying to focus. around 1:00 PM, I ordered a steak for lunch. Rare. I needed the iron. I felt depleted, hollowed out.

I was eating at my desk, slicing the meat, when I felt it again. The gaze.

I looked up. The glass walls of my office look out over the main design floor.

He was standing on the far side of the room, behind a row of mannequins. He was perfectly still, watching me.

I froze, a piece of steak halfway to my mouth.

He was staring at my jaw. As I chewed, slowly, his jaw moved. He wasn't eating anything. He was mimicking the motion. A rhythmic, grinding rotation of the mandible. His mouth was closed, but the muscles in his cheeks bunched and released in perfect sync with mine.

He looked bigger. His suit, usually baggy, looked tighter across the shoulders. His neck looked longer.

I dropped my fork. The clatter echoed in the silence of my office.

He stopped chewing. He smiled. This time, he opened his mouth.

His teeth were different. I had seen them before—normal, flat human teeth. Now, they looked sharper. Pointed. And there were gaps, as if his gums were receding to make room for something else.

He raised a hand and pointed at his own neck. He rubbed it, mimicking the way I had scrubbed my skin the night before.

Then he turned and walked away. His walk was wrong. It was too smooth. His upper body didn't bob. He just glided, his legs moving in a blur that my eyes couldn't quite track.

I locked my office door. I called security and told them to revoke his badge. I told them he was harassing me. They said they would escort him out the moment they saw him.

They never saw him.

Fast forward to tonight.

It’s the end of the quarter. I had to stay. I told myself I was safe. We have keycard access, security patrols, cameras. I’m on the forty-second floor. No one gets up here without a pass.

By 9:00 PM, the office was deserted. The cleaning crew had come and gone. The lights were dimmed to the emergency track lighting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of desks.

I was packing up. I had my bag on my shoulder. I had my hand on the door handle.

It wouldn't turn.

I frowned and jiggled it. Locked. But it doesn't lock from the outside.

I looked through the glass wall.

The main floor was dark, but the moonlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows illuminated the room in a cold, blue wash.

The room looked... different.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. The air seemed hazy, shimmering. I squinted.

There were lines connecting the desks.

Fine, glistening threads stretched from the corners of the cubicles to the ceiling. They crisscrossed the room, creating a complex, geometric geometry. 

And in the center of the room, sitting on top of the reception desk, was the Archivist.

He was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his arms resting on them, and he was naked.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the glass.

He turned his head. His eyes caught the light. They reflected it back like a cat's eyes, a bright, chilling green.

He hopped down from the desk. He didn't make a sound. He landed on all fours and stayed there.

""Open the door!"" I screamed, my voice cracking. ""I’m calling the police!"" despite knowing he couldn’t hear me

He stood up then. Slowly. His spine uncurled with a sickening popping sound, like knuckles cracking underwater. He was impossibly tall. His limbs had elongated. His arms hung down past his knees. His skin was stark white, and I could see dark veins pulsing underneath it.

He walked toward my office door. He wasn't wearing clothes, but he wasn't naked, exactly. His skin was covered in a fine, downy white hair. And around his waist, trailing behind him like a train, was a mass of that same white fabric. It was coming out of him. It was spinning from spinnerets located at the base of his spine.

He pressed his face against the glass.

""The tensile strength is insufficient,"" he whispered. The glass is soundproof, but I heard him. I heard him because his voice wasn't coming from the air; it was vibrating through the floor, through the walls.

""You are fragile,"" he said. ""You break. You tear. You rot.""

""Go away!"" I yelled, backing up until I hit my desk. I grabbed my letter opener. It was dull, useless. I remembered the pocket knife I keep in my drawer for opening fabric bales. A heavy-duty, serrated folding knife. I grabbed it. I flicked it open.

""I can fix you,"" he murmured. ""I can wrap you. Keep you fresh. The juice stays inside when the casing is tight.""

He reached for the door handle, and just pushed.

The metal lock snapped with a loud bang. The door swung open.

I ran.

My office has two doors. One to the main floor, one to a side corridor that leads to the freight elevators. I sprinted for the side door.

I burst into the hallway. It was dark.

I took three steps and stopped.

The hallway was a maze.

Invisible threads were strung across the corridor at various heights. Ankle level. Waist level. Neck level. They were so fine they were almost invisible, catching the emergency light only when I moved my head.

I turned to go back, but he was already in the doorway of my office.

He wasn't walking anymore. He was skittering. He moved across the wall, his hands and feet adhering to the drywall, his body defying gravity. He looked like a pale, distorted gecko.

""Don't run,"" he hissed. ""Movement degrades the fibers.""

I had no choice. I dove forward, trying to go under the waist-high threads.

I miscalculated.

A thread caught my upper arm, and It went through my blazer, my blouse, and into my skin like a hot wire.

I screamed and yanked my arm back. Blood sprayed.

The smell hit him instantly.

He stopped moving, and froze on the wall. His head snapped toward me. He inhaled deeply, a rattling, wet sound.

""Leakage,"" he moaned. ""Precious fluids.""

He launched himself off the wall.

He swung. A line of silk shot from his wrist—yes, his wrist—and adhered to the ceiling light fixture. He swung toward me in a pendulum arc.

I scrambled on the floor, crawling on my stomach to avoid the tripwires. I could hear him landing behind me. The sound of his bare feet slapping the linoleum was wet and heavy.

I reached the corner. The freight elevator was twenty feet away.

Something wrapped around my ankle.

It was soft, sticky, and incredibly strong. I kicked out, but the more I struggled, the tighter it got. I was being reeled in.

I was dragged backward across the carpet. I clawed at the floor, my nails breaking.

He was standing over me.

Up close, he was a nightmare of biology. His face was still human, but distorted. His eyes were huge, unblinking. His jaw hung slack, revealing rows of needle-teeth. And the smell... it was the smell of the protein shake, amplified a thousand times. Bleach and rot.

""Still,"" he commanded.

He began to spin me.

He used his hands, moving with blinding speed. He pulled ribbons of white silk from his abdomen and wound them around my legs. He lifted me up like I was a doll. He spun me. The silk tightened, binding my ankles together, then moving up to my knees.

I slashed out with the knife.

I cut his arm.

It bled a thick, white goo.

He shrieked—a sound that wasn't human. It was a high-pitched chittering that hurt my teeth. He dropped me.

I hit the floor hard. My legs were bound, but my upper body was free.

I slashed at the silk on my legs. The serrated blade sawed through the fibers. It was tough, like cutting through Kevlar, but the knife was sharp.

""You are damaging the merchandise!"" he screamed. He was backed against the wall, clutching his wounded arm. The white goo was bubbling, hardening into a scab almost instantly.

I freed my legs. I scrambled up.

He lunged.

I didn't run away. I stepped into him. I’m a Creative Director. I deal with problems head-on.

I drove the knife into his shoulder.

It sank in with a sickening squelch.

He roared and backhanded me. I flew across the hall and hit the opposite wall. The wind was knocked out of me.

But he didn't follow. He was staring at the knife handle sticking out of his shoulder. He looked confused.

""Imperfection,"" he whispered.

I didn't wait for him to process it. I ran for the elevator, and hit the button.

The doors seemed to take an eternity to open. I could hear him behind me. The sound of skittering, and of wet slapping.

I turned around.

He was on the ceiling. He was crawling right above me, his head rotated 180 degrees to look at me upside down. He opened his mouth, and a stream of liquid silk shot out.

The elevator doors pinged.

I threw myself inside. The silk stream hit the closing doors, splattering against the metal like gunshot.

I hammered the ""Lobby"" button.

As the doors closed, I saw him drop from the ceiling. He landed in a crouch right in front of the gap. He reached in with a long, pale hand.

The doors clamped shut on his fingers.

And he just pulled.

The metal doors groaned. They started to bend. He was prying the elevator doors open with his bare hands.

I shrank back into the corner, holding my pocket knife, praying the mechanism was stronger than him.

The elevator jolted. It began to descend.

There was a sickening crunch as his fingers were sheared off by the floor plate.

Four long, pale, severed fingers fell onto the elevator floor. They were twitching.

I watched them twitch all the way down to the lobby. They didn't stop moving until the doors opened again.

I ran. I ran past the sleeping security guard at the front desk, screaming my head off. I ran out into the street. I didn't stop until I saw a police cruiser.

Now I’m here.

The police went upstairs. They were gone for twenty minutes.

When they came down, the lead officer looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance.

""Ma'am,"" he said. ""There’s no one up there.""

""Did you see the webs?"" I asked, grabbing his arm. ""The threads? The blood?""

He shook his head. ""The office is pristine. Cleaning crew must have done a hell of a job. There's no blood. No webs. No giant spider-man.""

""But the fingers!"" I pointed to the elevator. ""The fingers on the floor!""

He sighed. ""We checked the elevator. It’s clean.""

""He took them,"" I whispered. ""He took them back to reattach them.""

""Ma'am, we found a pocket knife on the floor of the hallway. It has... white paint on it. And your own blood. We think maybe you cut yourself and had a panic attack.""

They handed me my knife in an evidence bag. The blade is coated in a dried, white crust. They think it's paint.

I know it's not paint.

I’m looking at the elevator right now. The officers are talking to the night guard, getting my statement.

The indicator light for the freight elevator just lit up.

It’s moving.

It’s coming down.

I’m looking at the glass doors of the lobby. Beyond them is the city, dark and full of alleys.

I have my phone. I have my knife.

I’m leaving. I’m not going home. He knows where I live.

I’m going to a hotel. One with no carpet, high traffic, and bright lights.

The elevator just dinged.

To give some background on him: my husband grew up believing the darker the coffee the better it is because that's what my in-laws always said. My parents also believe this for some reason so it might be a boomer thing? I'm not sure. My MIL makes a massive pot of coffee every morning using the darkest possible Starbucks beans that she buys from Costco and mornings when we visit them are miserable. I have to drown the coffee in cream to make it palatable because it is just bad. Normally I drink black coffee. My husband always said it was pleasant and I just let it go because there was no point in convincing him otherwise. 

Every morning I make a pour over for myself and my MIL gifted me another v60 for Christmas so I now have two of them. My husband has asked if I could make him coffee in the morning too and I have no issue with that since the whole process is meditation for me and I love brewing coffee. This has been going on since the end of December. 

On Thursday, my husband comes home from work looking distraught and I was genuinely worried what happened until he told me and I burst out laughing. They had an after school meeting at high school and the principal brought by Starbucks. My husband poured himself a big cup into his tumbler and took a sip. He said he nearly spit it out and felt like vomiting after drinking a few mouthfuls. 

He finished his story by saying ""You've ruined me for other coffee"". I take that as a compliment because this is the man who complained that what I drank was too fruity and ""not real coffee"".

Not because I wanted to flex at dinner parties (though that's a nice side effect), but because I realized how mentally fucking sluggish I'd become. Scrolling TikTok, consuming garbage content, feeling stupid in conversations. The average person reads less than 1 book per year after college. Wild right?

Here's what nobody tells you: being educated isn't about memorizing facts or collecting degrees. It's about building a framework for understanding literally everything around you. Psychology, economics, history, philosophy, the whole thing. I pulled this from books, research papers, podcasts, YouTube lectures. Basically became a knowledge goblin.

And yeah, our education system kinda sets us up to fail here. School teaches us WHAT to think, not HOW to think. Plus our brains are literally rewired for dopamine hits now thanks to social media algorithms. Neuroplasticity works both ways unfortunately.

Anyway, here's what actually worked:

**1. read like your brain depends on it (because it does)**

Start with 20 pages a day. That's it. Sounds pathetically small but it compounds to 30+ books yearly. The trick is reading GOOD shit, not self help fluff that repeats the same 3 ideas for 300 pages.

Grab ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman. Nobel prize winner, basically revolutionized behavioral economics. This book will make you question every decision you've ever made. It breaks down how your brain actually works, the cognitive biases screwing you over daily, why you're irrational as hell but think you're logical. Insanely good read. Best psychology book I've ever touched.

Also ""Sapiens"" by Yuval Noah Harari. This one gives you the entire human story, from irrelevant apes to gods of creation. Helps you understand why society operates the way it does, why we believe the things we believe. After reading this you'll see patterns everywhere.

**2. consume knowledge like you're building a mental model**

Your brain isn't a hard drive, it's a network. Everything needs to connect. When you learn something new, immediately ask ""how does this relate to what i already know?""

The podcast ""Huberman Lab"" is perfect for this. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscience professor at Stanford, breaks down complex science into actually useful protocols. Episodes on learning, sleep, dopamine. He explains the mechanisms behind everything so you understand WHY things work.

**3. use spaced repetition (this is non negotiable)**

Your brain forgets like 70% of what you learn within 24 hours unless you review it. Use apps that force you to revisit information.

Download Readwise. It resurfaces highlights from books/articles you've read. Sounds simple but it's genuinely life changing. You actually RETAIN what you read instead of finishing a book and remembering basically nothing 2 weeks later.

Also get into Anki for anything you want to permanently remember. Yeah it's a bit tedious but medical students use it to memorize thousands of concepts. Works.

If you want something more engaging that actually connects all these dots for you, there's BeFreed. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google that pulls from books, research papers, expert talks, and more to create personalized audio podcasts based on your specific goals.

You can literally type something like ""I want to become disgustingly educated but struggle with retention and connecting ideas"" and it generates a structured learning plan just for you, complete with customizable depth (10-min summaries or 40-min deep dives). The adaptive plan evolves based on what you highlight and how you interact with it. Plus you get a virtual coach that captures your insights automatically so you don't lose those random ""aha"" moments. Makes learning way more addictive than doomscrolling.

**4. learn frameworks not facts**

Mental models are your cheat code. They let you understand new situations instantly because you recognize underlying patterns.

Read ""Poor Charlie's Almanack"" about Charlie Munger. Dude literally collected mental models from every discipline, physics, biology, psychology, economics, used them to become one of the most successful investors ever. The book teaches you to think in systems.

Key models to start: first principles thinking (break problems to fundamentals) second order thinking (consider consequences of consequences) inversion (solve problems backward) occam's razor (simplest explanation usually correct)

**5. actually write about what you learn**

This forces clarity. If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.

Start a notion page or private blog. After finishing a book or podcast, write 3 key takeaways and how you'll apply them. Takes 10 mins max but cements the knowledge.

**6. cross pollinate knowledge areas**

The most interesting insights happen at intersections. Psychology + economics = behavioral economics. Biology + computers = AI.

""Range"" by David Epstein destroys the myth of specialization. Shows how generalists actually outperform specialists in complex unpredictable fields. The book profiles people who succeeded BECAUSE they had diverse knowledge, not despite it.

**7. build a second brain system**

You can't remember everything, so don't try. Capture ideas immediately.

Use Notion or Obsidian to create a personal knowledge management system. Tag everything, link related concepts. When you need information later, you know exactly where it lives.

**8. listen at 1.5-2x speed**

Podcasts and audiobooks at normal speed feel painfully slow once you adjust. You can consume 2x the content in the same time. Your brain adapts within like 3 days.

Lex Fridman podcast is gold for this. He interviews scientists, philosophers, historians. Super long form, deep conversations. Speed it up and you're basically getting MIT level education for free.

**9. teach what you learn**

Explaining concepts to others reveals gaps in your understanding instantly. Even if it's just explaining to a friend over coffee or posting on reddit.

The Feynman technique: pick a concept, explain it to a 12 year old, identify gaps in your explanation, go back and relearn those parts.

**10. curate your inputs obsessively**

Your brain is shaped by what you feed it. Garbage in, garbage out.

Unfollow everyone posting rage bait and doom scrolling content. Follow scientists, authors, thinkers. Make your feed actually educational.

Use Matter or Instapaper to save quality articles, read them properly later instead of skimming while distracted.

The compound effect here is insane. 6 months of this and you'll notice you understand conversations differently. Patterns emerge everywhere. You connect dots others miss.

Your brain literally restructures itself through neuroplasticity. The more you learn, the easier learning becomes. It's like compound interest for your mind.

Being educated isn't about showing off or collecting credentials. It's about seeing reality more clearly, making better decisions, understanding why things happen. It makes literally everything in life more interesting.

Start small. 20 pages today. One podcast episode. Write 3 sentences about what you learned.

1r7ec6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r7ec6v/im_a_creative_director_in_high_fashion_i_just/,"I’m a Creative Director in high fashion. I just fired an employee for making clothes out of something that wasn’t fabric, and now the police can't find him.","I’m standing in the lobby of my building, flanked by two officers who look bored and a night security guard who looks terrified. They just came down from the forty-second floor. They told me the office is empty. They told me there is no sign of a struggle, no sign of the man I know was there, and absolutely no trace of the ""webbing"" I screamed about on the 911 call.

They think I’m hysterical. They think the stress of Fashion Week finally snapped my mind like a brittle thread. But I know what I saw. I know what I felt tighten around my throat. And I know that somewhere in the city, a man is moving through the dark with limbs that have too many joints, looking for me.

I need to get this down while the adrenaline is still keeping the shock at bay.

I work in what people like to call ""the industry."" It sounds vague, but if you’re in it, you know. It’s a world built on surfaces, on the drape of a silk-charmeuse, the hand of a virgin wool, the aggressive structure of a neoprene bodice. I am the Creative Director for a textile design firm that supplies the houses you see in Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and I am good at my job because I am cold, I am precise, and I understand the architecture of materials better than I understand human beings.

My office is a glass box in the sky, disconnected from the grit of the street below. We deal in luxury. Silence, temperature control, and aesthetic perfection are the baselines of my existence. Or they were, until the Archivist started coming up from the basement.

I won’t use names. Not for the company, not for myself, and certainly not for him. Let’s just call him the Archivist.

He started six months ago. Our firm has a massive physical archive—swatches dating back to the 1920s, rare lace from Belgium, banned synthetic experiments from the 60s. It’s a dungeon of climate-controlled drawers in the sub-basement. He was hired to digitize the collection.

The first time I noticed him, I was shouting at an intern about a color mismatch in a dye lot. I was in the communal design space, a vast open-plan room with cutting tables and dress forms. The room went quiet, as it usually does when I raise my voice, but I felt eyes on me. Not the fearful eyes of my staff, but a heavy, predatory gaze.

I turned and saw him standing by the elevator banks. He was pale—not just fair-skinned, but translucent, like a deep-sea fish brought up too quickly. He was tall, incredibly thin, and wore a suit that seemed two sizes too big, hanging off his shoulders like it was draped over a wire hanger.

And he was staring at my jacket.

I was wearing a vintage piece, a structured boucle with a high collar. He walked over, ignoring the intern I had just reduced to tears, and reached out.

Before I could recoil, his fingers brushed my sleeve. His hands were long, the fingers tapering into nails that were perfectly manicured but slightly yellow.

""Tensile strength,"" he murmured. His voice was dry, like paper sliding over paper. ""Interesting weave. The warp is resisting the weft. It’s... tense.""

""Excuse me?"" I snapped, stepping back. ""Do not touch me.""

He didn't look embarrassed. He didn't even look at my eyes. He looked at his own fingertips, rubbing them together as if savoring the residue of the fabric.

""The lanolin content is low,"" he said, more to himself than me. ""Brittle. You need something with more give. Something that binds.""

""Get back to the basement,"" I ordered. ""If you need to speak to me, make an appointment.""

He smiled then. It was a small, tight movement. His lips were thin and colorless. ""I’m just admiring the casing. It’s important to protect the contents.""

That was the beginning.

Over the next few weeks, he found reasons to be on my floor. I’d find him hovering by the fabric printers, watching the ink soak into the rolls of linen. I’d see him in the break room, standing perfectly still in front of the vending machine, not buying anything, just staring at the reflection in the glass.

He was obsessed with protein. That was the other thing. Every time I saw him, he was drinking from a shaker bottle. It was always this thick, viscous white liquid. It smelled faintly of bleach and raw egg whites. He drank liters of the stuff. I asked his supervisor about it once, casually, and she told me he claimed to have a ""hyper-metabolism"" that required constant fuel.

""He’s weird, but he’s a genius with the fibers,"" she had said. ""He can identify a blend just by listening to the sound it makes when you rub it. He’s never wrong.""

I tried to ignore him. I had a fall collection to finalize, and the pressure was mounting. But the ""gifts"" started appearing.

The first one was on my chair when I came back from lunch. A small square of fabric, no bigger than a handkerchief. It was white, shimmering with a pearlescent luster I had never seen before. I picked it up. It was incredibly soft, almost oily, but lighter than air. It felt like holding a cloud.

I rubbed it between my fingers. I couldn't identify the fiber. It wasn't silk—silk has a catch to it, a microscopic friction. This was frictionless. It wasn't synthetic—synthetics have a plastic warmth. This was cool to the touch.

There was a note pinned to it with a silver needle. For the neck. High elasticity. Waterproof.

I threw it in the trash. I assumed he had stolen it from the archive.

A week later, I found a pair of gloves. Same material, but dyed a deep, bruising purple. I didn't try them on, but I noticed the construction. There were no seams. They weren't knitted or woven. It looked like the fabric had been grown in that shape.

I called security that time. They talked to him. He claimed he was just ""prototyping"" and wanted the Creative Director’s eye. They let him off with a warning.

I should have fired him then. God, I should have fired him then. But I was arrogant. I thought he was just a socially awkward weirdo who worshiped my taste. I’m used to people being obsessed with me; it comes with the job title.

The turning point was last Tuesday. It was late, past 10:00 PM. The heating in the building shuts down to a low hum after eight to save energy, and my office was freezing. I was wrapped in my coat, shivering, trying to approve a layout for a show in Milan.

I realized I had left my scarf in the car.

I looked at the corner of my desk. There was a box there. It had appeared while I was in a meeting earlier that day. I hadn't opened it.

Desperation makes you do stupid things. I opened the box.

Inside was a scarf. It was the same white material as the swatch, but thicker, layered. It looked heavy, but when I lifted it, it weighed nothing. It rippled over my hands like water.

I hesitated. But the chill in the room was biting through my blouse. I told myself I would just wear it for an hour. Just to get warm.

I draped it around my neck.

The sensation was immediate and overwhelming, and it felt like it was generating its own heat. It settled against my skin with a weight that felt reassuring, like a firm hand resting on my shoulder. It was incredibly comfortable.

I went back to work. The shivering stopped. I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me, a lethargy that smoothed out the jagged edges of my stress. I typed, reviewed, and drank my coffee.

An hour passed. I reached up to adjust the scarf, to loosen it a bit.

It didn't move.

I pulled harder. The fabric seemed to have adhered to my skin like... suction. It clung to the curve of my throat.

Panic flared in my chest. I went to the mirror in my private bathroom.

The scarf looked normal. But when I hooked my finger under the edge and pulled, my skin pulled with it. It was tight. Second-skin tight.

I clawed at it. I dug my nails in. The fabric was incredibly strong. It didn't tear. It barely stretched. Finally, with a grunt of effort, I managed to peel it away from my nape. There was a sound—a wet, velcro-like tearing sound.

I threw the scarf across the room. It landed in a heap, and for a second—I swear to God—it twitched. It slowly settled into a flat pool of white, but that initial movement looked like a muscle relaxing.

My neck was red and raw. I touched the skin. It felt sticky. There was a residue on me, a clear, odorless slime that dried quickly into a flaky white powder.

I washed my neck for ten minutes, scrubbing until I bled. I threw the scarf in the trash compactor in the hallway.

I didn't sleep that night. I felt heavy. My limbs felt like they were moving through syrup. I had dreams of being wrapped in a cocoon, suspended in the dark, while something massive and many-legged picked delicately at my clothes.

The next day, I came in determined to terminate his employment. I didn't care about HR protocols. I was going to throw him out of the building myself.

But I couldn't find him. He wasn't in the archive. He wasn't in the break room.

I sat at my desk, trying to focus. around 1:00 PM, I ordered a steak for lunch. Rare. I needed the iron. I felt depleted, hollowed out.

I was eating at my desk, slicing the meat, when I felt it again. The gaze.

I looked up. The glass walls of my office look out over the main design floor.

He was standing on the far side of the room, behind a row of mannequins. He was perfectly still, watching me.

I froze, a piece of steak halfway to my mouth.

He was staring at my jaw. As I chewed, slowly, his jaw moved. He wasn't eating anything. He was mimicking the motion. A rhythmic, grinding rotation of the mandible. His mouth was closed, but the muscles in his cheeks bunched and released in perfect sync with mine.

He looked bigger. His suit, usually baggy, looked tighter across the shoulders. His neck looked longer.

I dropped my fork. The clatter echoed in the silence of my office.

He stopped chewing. He smiled. This time, he opened his mouth.

His teeth were different. I had seen them before—normal, flat human teeth. Now, they looked sharper. Pointed. And there were gaps, as if his gums were receding to make room for something else.

He raised a hand and pointed at his own neck. He rubbed it, mimicking the way I had scrubbed my skin the night before.

Then he turned and walked away. His walk was wrong. It was too smooth. His upper body didn't bob. He just glided, his legs moving in a blur that my eyes couldn't quite track.

I locked my office door. I called security and told them to revoke his badge. I told them he was harassing me. They said they would escort him out the moment they saw him.

They never saw him.

Fast forward to tonight.

It’s the end of the quarter. I had to stay. I told myself I was safe. We have keycard access, security patrols, cameras. I’m on the forty-second floor. No one gets up here without a pass.

By 9:00 PM, the office was deserted. The cleaning crew had come and gone. The lights were dimmed to the emergency track lighting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of desks.

I was packing up. I had my bag on my shoulder. I had my hand on the door handle.

It wouldn't turn.

I frowned and jiggled it. Locked. But it doesn't lock from the outside.

I looked through the glass wall.

The main floor was dark, but the moonlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows illuminated the room in a cold, blue wash.

The room looked... different.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. The air seemed hazy, shimmering. I squinted.

There were lines connecting the desks.

Fine, glistening threads stretched from the corners of the cubicles to the ceiling. They crisscrossed the room, creating a complex, geometric geometry. 

And in the center of the room, sitting on top of the reception desk, was the Archivist.

He was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his arms resting on them, and he was naked.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the glass.

He turned his head. His eyes caught the light. They reflected it back like a cat's eyes, a bright, chilling green.

He hopped down from the desk. He didn't make a sound. He landed on all fours and stayed there.

""Open the door!"" I screamed, my voice cracking. ""I’m calling the police!"" despite knowing he couldn’t hear me

He stood up then. Slowly. His spine uncurled with a sickening popping sound, like knuckles cracking underwater. He was impossibly tall. His limbs had elongated. His arms hung down past his knees. His skin was stark white, and I could see dark veins pulsing underneath it.

He walked toward my office door. He wasn't wearing clothes, but he wasn't naked, exactly. His skin was covered in a fine, downy white hair. And around his waist, trailing behind him like a train, was a mass of that same white fabric. It was coming out of him. It was spinning from spinnerets located at the base of his spine.

He pressed his face against the glass.

""The tensile strength is insufficient,"" he whispered. The glass is soundproof, but I heard him. I heard him because his voice wasn't coming from the air; it was vibrating through the floor, through the walls.

""You are fragile,"" he said. ""You break. You tear. You rot.""

""Go away!"" I yelled, backing up until I hit my desk. I grabbed my letter opener. It was dull, useless. I remembered the pocket knife I keep in my drawer for opening fabric bales. A heavy-duty, serrated folding knife. I grabbed it. I flicked it open.

""I can fix you,"" he murmured. ""I can wrap you. Keep you fresh. The juice stays inside when the casing is tight.""

He reached for the door handle, and just pushed.

The metal lock snapped with a loud bang. The door swung open.

I ran.

My office has two doors. One to the main floor, one to a side corridor that leads to the freight elevators. I sprinted for the side door.

I burst into the hallway. It was dark.

I took three steps and stopped.

The hallway was a maze.

Invisible threads were strung across the corridor at various heights. Ankle level. Waist level. Neck level. They were so fine they were almost invisible, catching the emergency light only when I moved my head.

I turned to go back, but he was already in the doorway of my office.

He wasn't walking anymore. He was skittering. He moved across the wall, his hands and feet adhering to the drywall, his body defying gravity. He looked like a pale, distorted gecko.

""Don't run,"" he hissed. ""Movement degrades the fibers.""

I had no choice. I dove forward, trying to go under the waist-high threads.

I miscalculated.

A thread caught my upper arm, and It went through my blazer, my blouse, and into my skin like a hot wire.

I screamed and yanked my arm back. Blood sprayed.

The smell hit him instantly.

He stopped moving, and froze on the wall. His head snapped toward me. He inhaled deeply, a rattling, wet sound.

""Leakage,"" he moaned. ""Precious fluids.""

He launched himself off the wall.

He swung. A line of silk shot from his wrist—yes, his wrist—and adhered to the ceiling light fixture. He swung toward me in a pendulum arc.

I scrambled on the floor, crawling on my stomach to avoid the tripwires. I could hear him landing behind me. The sound of his bare feet slapping the linoleum was wet and heavy.

I reached the corner. The freight elevator was twenty feet away.

Something wrapped around my ankle.

It was soft, sticky, and incredibly strong. I kicked out, but the more I struggled, the tighter it got. I was being reeled in.

I was dragged backward across the carpet. I clawed at the floor, my nails breaking.

He was standing over me.

Up close, he was a nightmare of biology. His face was still human, but distorted. His eyes were huge, unblinking. His jaw hung slack, revealing rows of needle-teeth. And the smell... it was the smell of the protein shake, amplified a thousand times. Bleach and rot.

""Still,"" he commanded.

He began to spin me.

He used his hands, moving with blinding speed. He pulled ribbons of white silk from his abdomen and wound them around my legs. He lifted me up like I was a doll. He spun me. The silk tightened, binding my ankles together, then moving up to my knees.

I slashed out with the knife.

I cut his arm.

It bled a thick, white goo.

He shrieked—a sound that wasn't human. It was a high-pitched chittering that hurt my teeth. He dropped me.

I hit the floor hard. My legs were bound, but my upper body was free.

I slashed at the silk on my legs. The serrated blade sawed through the fibers. It was tough, like cutting through Kevlar, but the knife was sharp.

""You are damaging the merchandise!"" he screamed. He was backed against the wall, clutching his wounded arm. The white goo was bubbling, hardening into a scab almost instantly.

I freed my legs. I scrambled up.

He lunged.

I didn't run away. I stepped into him. I’m a Creative Director. I deal with problems head-on.

I drove the knife into his shoulder.

It sank in with a sickening squelch.

He roared and backhanded me. I flew across the hall and hit the opposite wall. The wind was knocked out of me.

But he didn't follow. He was staring at the knife handle sticking out of his shoulder. He looked confused.

""Imperfection,"" he whispered.

I didn't wait for him to process it. I ran for the elevator, and hit the button.

The doors seemed to take an eternity to open. I could hear him behind me. The sound of skittering, and of wet slapping.

I turned around.

He was on the ceiling. He was crawling right above me, his head rotated 180 degrees to look at me upside down. He opened his mouth, and a stream of liquid silk shot out.

The elevator doors pinged.

I threw myself inside. The silk stream hit the closing doors, splattering against the metal like gunshot.

I hammered the ""Lobby"" button.

As the doors closed, I saw him drop from the ceiling. He landed in a crouch right in front of the gap. He reached in with a long, pale hand.

The doors clamped shut on his fingers.

And he just pulled.

The metal doors groaned. They started to bend. He was prying the elevator doors open with his bare hands.

I shrank back into the corner, holding my pocket knife, praying the mechanism was stronger than him.

The elevator jolted. It began to descend.

There was a sickening crunch as his fingers were sheared off by the floor plate.

Four long, pale, severed fingers fell onto the elevator floor. They were twitching.

I watched them twitch all the way down to the lobby. They didn't stop moving until the doors opened again.

I ran. I ran past the sleeping security guard at the front desk, screaming my head off. I ran out into the street. I didn't stop until I saw a police cruiser.

Now I’m here.

The police went upstairs. They were gone for twenty minutes.

When they came down, the lead officer looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance.

""Ma'am,"" he said. ""There’s no one up there.""

""Did you see the webs?"" I asked, grabbing his arm. ""The threads? The blood?""

He shook his head. ""The office is pristine. Cleaning crew must have done a hell of a job. There's no blood. No webs. No giant spider-man.""

""But the fingers!"" I pointed to the elevator. ""The fingers on the floor!""

He sighed. ""We checked the elevator. It’s clean.""

""He took them,"" I whispered. ""He took them back to reattach them.""

""Ma'am, we found a pocket knife on the floor of the hallway. It has... white paint on it. And your own blood. We think maybe you cut yourself and had a panic attack.""

They handed me my knife in an evidence bag. The blade is coated in a dried, white crust. They think it's paint.

I know it's not paint.

I’m looking at the elevator right now. The officers are talking to the night guard, getting my statement.

The indicator light for the freight elevator just lit up.

It’s moving.

It’s coming down.

I’m looking at the glass doors of the lobby. Beyond them is the city, dark and full of alleys.

I have my phone. I have my knife.

I’m leaving. I’m not going home. He knows where I live.

I’m going to a hotel. One with no carpet, high traffic, and bright lights.

The elevator just dinged.

The scarf looked normal. But when I hooked my finger under the edge and pulled, my skin pulled with it. It was tight. Second-skin tight.

I clawed at it. I dug my nails in. The fabric was incredibly strong. It didn't tear. It barely stretched. Finally, with a grunt of effort, I managed to peel it away from my nape. There was a sound—a wet, velcro-like tearing sound.

I threw the scarf across the room. It landed in a heap, and for a second—I swear to God—it twitched. It slowly settled into a flat pool of white, but that initial movement looked like a muscle relaxing.

My neck was red and raw. I touched the skin. It felt sticky. There was a residue on me, a clear, odorless slime that dried quickly into a flaky white powder.

I washed my neck for ten minutes, scrubbing until I bled. I threw the scarf in the trash compactor in the hallway.

I didn't sleep that night. I felt heavy. My limbs felt like they were moving through syrup. I had dreams of being wrapped in a cocoon, suspended in the dark, while something massive and many-legged picked delicately at my clothes.

The next day, I came in determined to terminate his employment. I didn't care about HR protocols. I was going to throw him out of the building myself.

But I couldn't find him. He wasn't in the archive. He wasn't in the break room.

I sat at my desk, trying to focus. around 1:00 PM, I ordered a steak for lunch. Rare. I needed the iron. I felt depleted, hollowed out.

I was eating at my desk, slicing the meat, when I felt it again. The gaze.

I looked up. The glass walls of my office look out over the main design floor.

He was standing on the far side of the room, behind a row of mannequins. He was perfectly still, watching me.

I froze, a piece of steak halfway to my mouth.

He was staring at my jaw. As I chewed, slowly, his jaw moved. He wasn't eating anything. He was mimicking the motion. A rhythmic, grinding rotation of the mandible. His mouth was closed, but the muscles in his cheeks bunched and released in perfect sync with mine.

He looked bigger. His suit, usually baggy, looked tighter across the shoulders. His neck looked longer.

I dropped my fork. The clatter echoed in the silence of my office.

He stopped chewing. He smiled. This time, he opened his mouth.

His teeth were different. I had seen them before—normal, flat human teeth. Now, they looked sharper. Pointed. And there were gaps, as if his gums were receding to make room for something else.

He raised a hand and pointed at his own neck. He rubbed it, mimicking the way I had scrubbed my skin the night before.

Then he turned and walked away. His walk was wrong. It was too smooth. His upper body didn't bob. He just glided, his legs moving in a blur that my eyes couldn't quite track.

I locked my office door. I called security and told them to revoke his badge. I told them he was harassing me. They said they would escort him out the moment they saw him.

They never saw him.

Fast forward to tonight.

It’s the end of the quarter. I had to stay. I told myself I was safe. We have keycard access, security patrols, cameras. I’m on the forty-second floor. No one gets up here without a pass.

By 9:00 PM, the office was deserted. The cleaning crew had come and gone. The lights were dimmed to the emergency track lighting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of desks.

I was packing up. I had my bag on my shoulder. I had my hand on the door handle.

It wouldn't turn.

I frowned and jiggled it. Locked. But it doesn't lock from the outside.

I looked through the glass wall.

The main floor was dark, but the moonlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows illuminated the room in a cold, blue wash.

The room looked... different.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. The air seemed hazy, shimmering. I squinted.

There were lines connecting the desks.

Fine, glistening threads stretched from the corners of the cubicles to the ceiling. They crisscrossed the room, creating a complex, geometric geometry. 

And in the center of the room, sitting on top of the reception desk, was the Archivist.

He was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his arms resting on them, and he was naked.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the glass.

He turned his head. His eyes caught the light. They reflected it back like a cat's eyes, a bright, chilling green.

He hopped down from the desk. He didn't make a sound. He landed on all fours and stayed there.

""Open the door!"" I screamed, my voice cracking. ""I’m calling the police!"" despite knowing he couldn’t hear me

He stood up then. Slowly. His spine uncurled with a sickening popping sound, like knuckles cracking underwater. He was impossibly tall. His limbs had elongated. His arms hung down past his knees. His skin was stark white, and I could see dark veins pulsing underneath it.

He walked toward my office door. He wasn't wearing clothes, but he wasn't naked, exactly. His skin was covered in a fine, downy white hair. And around his waist, trailing behind him like a train, was a mass of that same white fabric. It was coming out of him. It was spinning from spinnerets located at the base of his spine.

He pressed his face against the glass.

""The tensile strength is insufficient,"" he whispered. The glass is soundproof, but I heard him. I heard him because his voice wasn't coming from the air; it was vibrating through the floor, through the walls.

""You are fragile,"" he said. ""You break. You tear. You rot.""

""Go away!"" I yelled, backing up until I hit my desk. I grabbed my letter opener. It was dull, useless. I remembered the pocket knife I keep in my drawer for opening fabric bales. A heavy-duty, serrated folding knife. I grabbed it. I flicked it open.

""I can fix you,"" he murmured. ""I can wrap you. Keep you fresh. The juice stays inside when the casing is tight.""

He reached for the door handle, and just pushed.

The metal lock snapped with a loud bang. The door swung open.

I ran.

My office has two doors. One to the main floor, one to a side corridor that leads to the freight elevators. I sprinted for the side door.

I burst into the hallway. It was dark.

I took three steps and stopped.

The hallway was a maze.

Invisible threads were strung across the corridor at various heights. Ankle level. Waist level. Neck level. They were so fine they were almost invisible, catching the emergency light only when I moved my head.

I turned to go back, but he was already in the doorway of my office.

He wasn't walking anymore. He was skittering. He moved across the wall, his hands and feet adhering to the drywall, his body defying gravity. He looked like a pale, distorted gecko.

""Don't run,"" he hissed. ""Movement degrades the fibers.""

I had no choice. I dove forward, trying to go under the waist-high threads.

I miscalculated.

A thread caught my upper arm, and It went through my blazer, my blouse, and into my skin like a hot wire.

I screamed and yanked my arm back. Blood sprayed.

The smell hit him instantly.

He stopped moving, and froze on the wall. His head snapped toward me. He inhaled deeply, a rattling, wet sound.

""Leakage,"" he moaned. ""Precious fluids.""

He launched himself off the wall.

He swung. A line of silk shot from his wrist—yes, his wrist—and adhered to the ceiling light fixture. He swung toward me in a pendulum arc.

I scrambled on the floor, crawling on my stomach to avoid the tripwires. I could hear him landing behind me. The sound of his bare feet slapping the linoleum was wet and heavy.

I reached the corner. The freight elevator was twenty feet away.

Something wrapped around my ankle.

It was soft, sticky, and incredibly strong. I kicked out, but the more I struggled, the tighter it got. I was being reeled in.

I was dragged backward across the carpet. I clawed at the floor, my nails breaking.

He was standing over me.

Up close, he was a nightmare of biology. His face was still human, but distorted. His eyes were huge, unblinking. His jaw hung slack, revealing rows of needle-teeth. And the smell... it was the smell of the protein shake, amplified a thousand times. Bleach and rot.

""Still,"" he commanded.

He began to spin me.

He used his hands, moving with blinding speed. He pulled ribbons of white silk from his abdomen and wound them around my legs. He lifted me up like I was a doll. He spun me. The silk tightened, binding my ankles together, then moving up to my knees.

I slashed out with the knife.

I cut his arm.

It bled a thick, white goo.

He shrieked—a sound that wasn't human. It was a high-pitched chittering that hurt my teeth. He dropped me.

I hit the floor hard. My legs were bound, but my upper body was free.

I slashed at the silk on my legs. The serrated blade sawed through the fibers. It was tough, like cutting through Kevlar, but the knife was sharp.

""You are damaging the merchandise!"" he screamed. He was backed against the wall, clutching his wounded arm. The white goo was bubbling, hardening into a scab almost instantly.

I freed my legs. I scrambled up.

He lunged.

I didn't run away. I stepped into him. I’m a Creative Director. I deal with problems head-on.

I drove the knife into his shoulder.

It sank in with a sickening squelch.

He roared and backhanded me. I flew across the hall and hit the opposite wall. The wind was knocked out of me.

But he didn't follow. He was staring at the knife handle sticking out of his shoulder. He looked confused.

""Imperfection,"" he whispered.

I didn't wait for him to process it. I ran for the elevator, and hit the button.

The doors seemed to take an eternity to open. I could hear him behind me. The sound of skittering, and of wet slapping.

I turned around.

He was on the ceiling. He was crawling right above me, his head rotated 180 degrees to look at me upside down. He opened his mouth, and a stream of liquid silk shot out.

The elevator doors pinged.

I threw myself inside. The silk stream hit the closing doors, splattering against the metal like gunshot.

I hammered the ""Lobby"" button.

As the doors closed, I saw him drop from the ceiling. He landed in a crouch right in front of the gap. He reached in with a long, pale hand.

The doors clamped shut on his fingers.

And he just pulled.

The metal doors groaned. They started to bend. He was prying the elevator doors open with his bare hands.

I shrank back into the corner, holding my pocket knife, praying the mechanism was stronger than him.

The elevator jolted. It began to descend.

There was a sickening crunch as his fingers were sheared off by the floor plate.

Four long, pale, severed fingers fell onto the elevator floor. They were twitching.

I watched them twitch all the way down to the lobby. They didn't stop moving until the doors opened again.

I ran. I ran past the sleeping security guard at the front desk, screaming my head off. I ran out into the street. I didn't stop until I saw a police cruiser.

Now I’m here.

The police went upstairs. They were gone for twenty minutes.

When they came down, the lead officer looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance.

""Ma'am,"" he said. ""There’s no one up there.""

""Did you see the webs?"" I asked, grabbing his arm. ""The threads? The blood?""

He shook his head. ""The office is pristine. Cleaning crew must have done a hell of a job. There's no blood. No webs. No giant spider-man.""

""But the fingers!"" I pointed to the elevator. ""The fingers on the floor!""

He sighed. ""We checked the elevator. It’s clean.""

""He took them,"" I whispered. ""He took them back to reattach them.""

""Ma'am, we found a pocket knife on the floor of the hallway. It has... white paint on it. And your own blood. We think maybe you cut yourself and had a panic attack.""

They handed me my knife in an evidence bag. The blade is coated in a dried, white crust. They think it's paint.

I know it's not paint.

I’m looking at the elevator right now. The officers are talking to the night guard, getting my statement.

The indicator light for the freight elevator just lit up.

It’s moving.

It’s coming down.

I’m looking at the glass doors of the lobby. Beyond them is the city, dark and full of alleys.

I have my phone. I have my knife.

I’m leaving. I’m not going home. He knows where I live.

I’m going to a hotel. One with no carpet, high traffic, and bright lights.

The elevator just dinged.

1r7ebkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1r7ebkm/im_a_creative_director_in_high_fashion_i_just/,"I’m a Creative Director in high fashion. I just fired an employee for making clothes out of something that wasn’t fabric, and now the police can't find him.","I’m standing in the lobby of my building, flanked by two officers who look bored and a night security guard who looks terrified. They just came down from the forty-second floor. They told me the office is empty. They told me there is no sign of a struggle, no sign of the man I know was there, and absolutely no trace of the ""webbing"" I screamed about on the 911 call.

They think I’m hysterical. They think the stress of Fashion Week finally snapped my mind like a brittle thread. But I know what I saw. I know what I felt tighten around my throat. And I know that somewhere in the city, a man is moving through the dark with limbs that have too many joints, looking for me.

I need to get this down while the adrenaline is still keeping the shock at bay.

I work in what people like to call ""the industry."" It sounds vague, but if you’re in it, you know. It’s a world built on surfaces, on the drape of a silk-charmeuse, the hand of a virgin wool, the aggressive structure of a neoprene bodice. I am the Creative Director for a textile design firm that supplies the houses you see in Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and I am good at my job because I am cold, I am precise, and I understand the architecture of materials better than I understand human beings.

My office is a glass box in the sky, disconnected from the grit of the street below. We deal in luxury. Silence, temperature control, and aesthetic perfection are the baselines of my existence. Or they were, until the Archivist started coming up from the basement.

I won’t use names. Not for the company, not for myself, and certainly not for him. Let’s just call him the Archivist.

He started six months ago. Our firm has a massive physical archive—swatches dating back to the 1920s, rare lace from Belgium, banned synthetic experiments from the 60s. It’s a dungeon of climate-controlled drawers in the sub-basement. He was hired to digitize the collection.

The first time I noticed him, I was shouting at an intern about a color mismatch in a dye lot. I was in the communal design space, a vast open-plan room with cutting tables and dress forms. The room went quiet, as it usually does when I raise my voice, but I felt eyes on me. Not the fearful eyes of my staff, but a heavy, predatory gaze.

I turned and saw him standing by the elevator banks. He was pale—not just fair-skinned, but translucent, like a deep-sea fish brought up too quickly. He was tall, incredibly thin, and wore a suit that seemed two sizes too big, hanging off his shoulders like it was draped over a wire hanger.

And he was staring at my jacket.

I was wearing a vintage piece, a structured boucle with a high collar. He walked over, ignoring the intern I had just reduced to tears, and reached out.

Before I could recoil, his fingers brushed my sleeve. His hands were long, the fingers tapering into nails that were perfectly manicured but slightly yellow.

""Tensile strength,"" he murmured. His voice was dry, like paper sliding over paper. ""Interesting weave. The warp is resisting the weft. It’s... tense.""

""Excuse me?"" I snapped, stepping back. ""Do not touch me.""

He didn't look embarrassed. He didn't even look at my eyes. He looked at his own fingertips, rubbing them together as if savoring the residue of the fabric.

""The lanolin content is low,"" he said, more to himself than me. ""Brittle. You need something with more give. Something that binds.""

""Get back to the basement,"" I ordered. ""If you need to speak to me, make an appointment.""

He smiled then. It was a small, tight movement. His lips were thin and colorless. ""I’m just admiring the casing. It’s important to protect the contents.""

That was the beginning.

Over the next few weeks, he found reasons to be on my floor. I’d find him hovering by the fabric printers, watching the ink soak into the rolls of linen. I’d see him in the break room, standing perfectly still in front of the vending machine, not buying anything, just staring at the reflection in the glass.

He was obsessed with protein. That was the other thing. Every time I saw him, he was drinking from a shaker bottle. It was always this thick, viscous white liquid. It smelled faintly of bleach and raw egg whites. He drank liters of the stuff. I asked his supervisor about it once, casually, and she told me he claimed to have a ""hyper-metabolism"" that required constant fuel.

""He’s weird, but he’s a genius with the fibers,"" she had said. ""He can identify a blend just by listening to the sound it makes when you rub it. He’s never wrong.""

I tried to ignore him. I had a fall collection to finalize, and the pressure was mounting. But the ""gifts"" started appearing.

The first one was on my chair when I came back from lunch. A small square of fabric, no bigger than a handkerchief. It was white, shimmering with a pearlescent luster I had never seen before. I picked it up. It was incredibly soft, almost oily, but lighter than air. It felt like holding a cloud.

I rubbed it between my fingers. I couldn't identify the fiber. It wasn't silk—silk has a catch to it, a microscopic friction. This was frictionless. It wasn't synthetic—synthetics have a plastic warmth. This was cool to the touch.

There was a note pinned to it with a silver needle. For the neck. High elasticity. Waterproof.

I threw it in the trash. I assumed he had stolen it from the archive.

A week later, I found a pair of gloves. Same material, but dyed a deep, bruising purple. I didn't try them on, but I noticed the construction. There were no seams. They weren't knitted or woven. It looked like the fabric had been grown in that shape.

I called security that time. They talked to him. He claimed he was just ""prototyping"" and wanted the Creative Director’s eye. They let him off with a warning.

I should have fired him then. God, I should have fired him then. But I was arrogant. I thought he was just a socially awkward weirdo who worshiped my taste. I’m used to people being obsessed with me; it comes with the job title.

The turning point was last Tuesday. It was late, past 10:00 PM. The heating in the building shuts down to a low hum after eight to save energy, and my office was freezing. I was wrapped in my coat, shivering, trying to approve a layout for a show in Milan.

I realized I had left my scarf in the car.

I looked at the corner of my desk. There was a box there. It had appeared while I was in a meeting earlier that day. I hadn't opened it.

Desperation makes you do stupid things. I opened the box.

Inside was a scarf. It was the same white material as the swatch, but thicker, layered. It looked heavy, but when I lifted it, it weighed nothing. It rippled over my hands like water.

I hesitated. But the chill in the room was biting through my blouse. I told myself I would just wear it for an hour. Just to get warm.

I draped it around my neck.

The sensation was immediate and overwhelming, and it felt like it was generating its own heat. It settled against my skin with a weight that felt reassuring, like a firm hand resting on my shoulder. It was incredibly comfortable.

I went back to work. The shivering stopped. I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me, a lethargy that smoothed out the jagged edges of my stress. I typed, reviewed, and drank my coffee.

An hour passed. I reached up to adjust the scarf, to loosen it a bit.

It didn't move.

I pulled harder. The fabric seemed to have adhered to my skin like... suction. It clung to the curve of my throat.

Panic flared in my chest. I went to the mirror in my private bathroom.

The scarf looked normal. But when I hooked my finger under the edge and pulled, my skin pulled with it. It was tight. Second-skin tight.

""Did you see the webs?"" I asked, grabbing his arm. ""The threads? The blood?""

He shook his head. ""The office is pristine. Cleaning crew must have done a hell of a job. There's no blood. No webs. No giant spider-man.""

1r7eavp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1r7eavp/im_a_creative_director_in_high_fashion_i_just/,"I’m a Creative Director in high fashion. I just fired an employee for making clothes out of something that wasn’t fabric, and now the police can't find him.","I’m standing in the lobby of my building, flanked by two officers who look bored and a night security guard who looks terrified. They just came down from the forty-second floor. They told me the office is empty. They told me there is no sign of a struggle, no sign of the man I know was there, and absolutely no trace of the ""webbing"" I screamed about on the 911 call.

They think I’m hysterical. They think the stress of Fashion Week finally snapped my mind like a brittle thread. But I know what I saw. I know what I felt tighten around my throat. And I know that somewhere in the city, a man is moving through the dark with limbs that have too many joints, looking for me.

I need to get this down while the adrenaline is still keeping the shock at bay.

I work in what people like to call ""the industry."" It sounds vague, but if you’re in it, you know. It’s a world built on surfaces, on the drape of a silk-charmeuse, the hand of a virgin wool, the aggressive structure of a neoprene bodice. I am the Creative Director for a textile design firm that supplies the houses you see in Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and I am good at my job because I am cold, I am precise, and I understand the architecture of materials better than I understand human beings.

My office is a glass box in the sky, disconnected from the grit of the street below. We deal in luxury. Silence, temperature control, and aesthetic perfection are the baselines of my existence. Or they were, until the Archivist started coming up from the basement.

I won’t use names. Not for the company, not for myself, and certainly not for him. Let’s just call him the Archivist.

He started six months ago. Our firm has a massive physical archive—swatches dating back to the 1920s, rare lace from Belgium, banned synthetic experiments from the 60s. It’s a dungeon of climate-controlled drawers in the sub-basement. He was hired to digitize the collection.

The first time I noticed him, I was shouting at an intern about a color mismatch in a dye lot. I was in the communal design space, a vast open-plan room with cutting tables and dress forms. The room went quiet, as it usually does when I raise my voice, but I felt eyes on me. Not the fearful eyes of my staff, but a heavy, predatory gaze.

I turned and saw him standing by the elevator banks. He was pale—not just fair-skinned, but translucent, like a deep-sea fish brought up too quickly. He was tall, incredibly thin, and wore a suit that seemed two sizes too big, hanging off his shoulders like it was draped over a wire hanger.

And he was staring at my jacket.

I was wearing a vintage piece, a structured boucle with a high collar. He walked over, ignoring the intern I had just reduced to tears, and reached out.

Before I could recoil, his fingers brushed my sleeve. His hands were long, the fingers tapering into nails that were perfectly manicured but slightly yellow.

""Tensile strength,"" he murmured. His voice was dry, like paper sliding over paper. ""Interesting weave. The warp is resisting the weft. It’s... tense.""

""Excuse me?"" I snapped, stepping back. ""Do not touch me.""

He didn't look embarrassed. He didn't even look at my eyes. He looked at his own fingertips, rubbing them together as if savoring the residue of the fabric.

""The lanolin content is low,"" he said, more to himself than me. ""Brittle. You need something with more give. Something that binds.""

""Get back to the basement,"" I ordered. ""If you need to speak to me, make an appointment.""

He smiled then. It was a small, tight movement. His lips were thin and colorless. ""I’m just admiring the casing. It’s important to protect the contents.""

That was the beginning.

Over the next few weeks, he found reasons to be on my floor. I’d find him hovering by the fabric printers, watching the ink soak into the rolls of linen. I’d see him in the break room, standing perfectly still in front of the vending machine, not buying anything, just staring at the reflection in the glass.

He was obsessed with protein. That was the other thing. Every time I saw him, he was drinking from a shaker bottle. It was always this thick, viscous white liquid. It smelled faintly of bleach and raw egg whites. He drank liters of the stuff. I asked his supervisor about it once, casually, and she told me he claimed to have a ""hyper-metabolism"" that required constant fuel.

""He’s weird, but he’s a genius with the fibers,"" she had said. ""He can identify a blend just by listening to the sound it makes when you rub it. He’s never wrong.""

I tried to ignore him. I had a fall collection to finalize, and the pressure was mounting. But the ""gifts"" started appearing.

The first one was on my chair when I came back from lunch. A small square of fabric, no bigger than a handkerchief. It was white, shimmering with a pearlescent luster I had never seen before. I picked it up. It was incredibly soft, almost oily, but lighter than air. It felt like holding a cloud.

I rubbed it between my fingers. I couldn't identify the fiber. It wasn't silk—silk has a catch to it, a microscopic friction. This was frictionless. It wasn't synthetic—synthetics have a plastic warmth. This was cool to the touch.

There was a note pinned to it with a silver needle. For the neck. High elasticity. Waterproof.

I threw it in the trash. I assumed he had stolen it from the archive.

A week later, I found a pair of gloves. Same material, but dyed a deep, bruising purple. I didn't try them on, but I noticed the construction. There were no seams. They weren't knitted or woven. It looked like the fabric had been grown in that shape.

I called security that time. They talked to him. He claimed he was just ""prototyping"" and wanted the Creative Director’s eye. They let him off with a warning.

I should have fired him then. God, I should have fired him then. But I was arrogant. I thought he was just a socially awkward weirdo who worshiped my taste. I’m used to people being obsessed with me; it comes with the job title.

The turning point was last Tuesday. It was late, past 10:00 PM. The heating in the building shuts down to a low hum after eight to save energy, and my office was freezing. I was wrapped in my coat, shivering, trying to approve a layout for a show in Milan.

I realized I had left my scarf in the car.

I looked at the corner of my desk. There was a box there. It had appeared while I was in a meeting earlier that day. I hadn't opened it.

Desperation makes you do stupid things. I opened the box.

Inside was a scarf. It was the same white material as the swatch, but thicker, layered. It looked heavy, but when I lifted it, it weighed nothing. It rippled over my hands like water.

I hesitated. But the chill in the room was biting through my blouse. I told myself I would just wear it for an hour. Just to get warm.

I draped it around my neck.

The sensation was immediate and overwhelming, and it felt like it was generating its own heat. It settled against my skin with a weight that felt reassuring, like a firm hand resting on my shoulder. It was incredibly comfortable.

I went back to work. The shivering stopped. I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me, a lethargy that smoothed out the jagged edges of my stress. I typed, reviewed, and drank my coffee.

An hour passed. I reached up to adjust the scarf, to loosen it a bit.

It didn't move.

I pulled harder. The fabric seemed to have adhered to my skin like... suction. It clung to the curve of my throat.

Panic flared in my chest. I went to the mirror in my private bathroom.

The scarf looked normal. But when I hooked my finger under the edge and pulled, my skin pulled with it. It was tight. Second-skin tight.

I clawed at it. I dug my nails in. The fabric was incredibly strong. It didn't tear. It barely stretched. Finally, with a grunt of effort, I managed to peel it away from my nape. There was a sound—a wet, velcro-like tearing sound.

I threw the scarf across the room. It landed in a heap, and for a second—I swear to God—it twitched. It slowly settled into a flat pool of white, but that initial movement looked like a muscle relaxing.

My neck was red and raw. I touched the skin. It felt sticky. There was a residue on me, a clear, odorless slime that dried quickly into a flaky white powder.

I washed my neck for ten minutes, scrubbing until I bled. I threw the scarf in the trash compactor in the hallway.

I didn't sleep that night. I felt heavy. My limbs felt like they were moving through syrup. I had dreams of being wrapped in a cocoon, suspended in the dark, while something massive and many-legged picked delicately at my clothes.

The next day, I came in determined to terminate his employment. I didn't care about HR protocols. I was going to throw him out of the building myself.

But I couldn't find him. He wasn't in the archive. He wasn't in the break room.

I sat at my desk, trying to focus. around 1:00 PM, I ordered a steak for lunch. Rare. I needed the iron. I felt depleted, hollowed out.

I was eating at my desk, slicing the meat, when I felt it again. The gaze.

I looked up. The glass walls of my office look out over the main design floor.

He was standing on the far side of the room, behind a row of mannequins. He was perfectly still, watching me.

I froze, a piece of steak halfway to my mouth.

He was staring at my jaw. As I chewed, slowly, his jaw moved. He wasn't eating anything. He was mimicking the motion. A rhythmic, grinding rotation of the mandible. His mouth was closed, but the muscles in his cheeks bunched and released in perfect sync with mine.

He looked bigger. His suit, usually baggy, looked tighter across the shoulders. His neck looked longer.

I dropped my fork. The clatter echoed in the silence of my office.

He stopped chewing. He smiled. This time, he opened his mouth.

His teeth were different. I had seen them before—normal, flat human teeth. Now, they looked sharper. Pointed. And there were gaps, as if his gums were receding to make room for something else.

He raised a hand and pointed at his own neck. He rubbed it, mimicking the way I had scrubbed my skin the night before.

Then he turned and walked away. His walk was wrong. It was too smooth. His upper body didn't bob. He just glided, his legs moving in a blur that my eyes couldn't quite track.

I locked my office door. I called security and told them to revoke his badge. I told them he was harassing me. They said they would escort him out the moment they saw him.

They never saw him.

Fast forward to tonight.

It’s the end of the quarter. I had to stay. I told myself I was safe. We have keycard access, security patrols, cameras. I’m on the forty-second floor. No one gets up here without a pass.

By 9:00 PM, the office was deserted. The cleaning crew had come and gone. The lights were dimmed to the emergency track lighting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of desks.

I was packing up. I had my bag on my shoulder. I had my hand on the door handle.

It wouldn't turn.

I frowned and jiggled it. Locked. But it doesn't lock from the outside.

I looked through the glass wall.

The main floor was dark, but the moonlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows illuminated the room in a cold, blue wash.

The room looked... different.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. The air seemed hazy, shimmering. I squinted.

There were lines connecting the desks.

Fine, glistening threads stretched from the corners of the cubicles to the ceiling. They crisscrossed the room, creating a complex, geometric geometry. 

And in the center of the room, sitting on top of the reception desk, was the Archivist.

He was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his arms resting on them, and he was naked.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the glass.

He turned his head. His eyes caught the light. They reflected it back like a cat's eyes, a bright, chilling green.

He hopped down from the desk. He didn't make a sound. He landed on all fours and stayed there.

""Open the door!"" I screamed, my voice cracking. ""I’m calling the police!"" despite knowing he couldn’t hear me

He stood up then. Slowly. His spine uncurled with a sickening popping sound, like knuckles cracking underwater. He was impossibly tall. His limbs had elongated. His arms hung down past his knees. His skin was stark white, and I could see dark veins pulsing underneath it.

He walked toward my office door. He wasn't wearing clothes, but he wasn't naked, exactly. His skin was covered in a fine, downy white hair. And around his waist, trailing behind him like a train, was a mass of that same white fabric. It was coming out of him. It was spinning from spinnerets located at the base of his spine.

He pressed his face against the glass.

""The tensile strength is insufficient,"" he whispered. The glass is soundproof, but I heard him. I heard him because his voice wasn't coming from the air; it was vibrating through the floor, through the walls.

""You are fragile,"" he said. ""You break. You tear. You rot.""

""Go away!"" I yelled, backing up until I hit my desk. I grabbed my letter opener. It was dull, useless. I remembered the pocket knife I keep in my drawer for opening fabric bales. A heavy-duty, serrated folding knife. I grabbed it. I flicked it open.

""I can fix you,"" he murmured. ""I can wrap you. Keep you fresh. The juice stays inside when the casing is tight.""

He reached for the door handle, and just pushed.

The metal lock snapped with a loud bang. The door swung open.

I ran.

My office has two doors. One to the main floor, one to a side corridor that leads to the freight elevators. I sprinted for the side door.

I burst into the hallway. It was dark.

I took three steps and stopped.

The hallway was a maze.

Invisible threads were strung across the corridor at various heights. Ankle level. Waist level. Neck level. They were so fine they were almost invisible, catching the emergency light only when I moved my head.

I turned to go back, but he was already in the doorway of my office.

He wasn't walking anymore. He was skittering. He moved across the wall, his hands and feet adhering to the drywall, his body defying gravity. He looked like a pale, distorted gecko.

""Don't run,"" he hissed. ""Movement degrades the fibers.""

I had no choice. I dove forward, trying to go under the waist-high threads.

I miscalculated.

A thread caught my upper arm, and It went through my blazer, my blouse, and into my skin like a hot wire.

I screamed and yanked my arm back. Blood sprayed.

The smell hit him instantly.

He stopped moving, and froze on the wall. His head snapped toward me. He inhaled deeply, a rattling, wet sound.

""Leakage,"" he moaned. ""Precious fluids.""

He launched himself off the wall.

He swung. A line of silk shot from his wrist—yes, his wrist—and adhered to the ceiling light fixture. He swung toward me in a pendulum arc.

I scrambled on the floor, crawling on my stomach to avoid the tripwires. I could hear him landing behind me. The sound of his bare feet slapping the linoleum was wet and heavy.

I reached the corner. The freight elevator was twenty feet away.

Something wrapped around my ankle.

It was soft, sticky, and incredibly strong. I kicked out, but the more I struggled, the tighter it got. I was being reeled in.

I was dragged backward across the carpet. I clawed at the floor, my nails breaking.

He was standing over me.

Up close, he was a nightmare of biology. His face was still human, but distorted. His eyes were huge, unblinking. His jaw hung slack, revealing rows of needle-teeth. And the smell... it was the smell of the protein shake, amplified a thousand times. Bleach and rot.

""Still,"" he commanded.

He began to spin me.

He used his hands, moving with blinding speed. He pulled ribbons of white silk from his abdomen and wound them around my legs. He lifted me up like I was a doll. He spun me. The silk tightened, binding my ankles together, then moving up to my knees.

I slashed out with the knife.

I cut his arm.

It bled a thick, white goo.

He shrieked—a sound that wasn't human. It was a high-pitched chittering that hurt my teeth. He dropped me.

I hit the floor hard. My legs were bound, but my upper body was free.

I slashed at the silk on my legs. The serrated blade sawed through the fibers. It was tough, like cutting through Kevlar, but the knife was sharp.

""You are damaging the merchandise!"" he screamed. He was backed against the wall, clutching his wounded arm. The white goo was bubbling, hardening into a scab almost instantly.

I freed my legs. I scrambled up.

He lunged.

I didn't run away. I stepped into him. I’m a Creative Director. I deal with problems head-on.

I drove the knife into his shoulder.

It sank in with a sickening squelch.

He roared and backhanded me. I flew across the hall and hit the opposite wall. The wind was knocked out of me.

But he didn't follow. He was staring at the knife handle sticking out of his shoulder. He looked confused.

""Imperfection,"" he whispered.

I didn't wait for him to process it. I ran for the elevator, and hit the button.

The doors seemed to take an eternity to open. I could hear him behind me. The sound of skittering, and of wet slapping.

I turned around.

He was on the ceiling. He was crawling right above me, his head rotated 180 degrees to look at me upside down. He opened his mouth, and a stream of liquid silk shot out.

The elevator doors pinged.

I threw myself inside. The silk stream hit the closing doors, splattering against the metal like gunshot.

I hammered the ""Lobby"" button.

As the doors closed, I saw him drop from the ceiling. He landed in a crouch right in front of the gap. He reached in with a long, pale hand.

The doors clamped shut on his fingers.

And he just pulled.

The metal doors groaned. They started to bend. He was prying the elevator doors open with his bare hands.

I shrank back into the corner, holding my pocket knife, praying the mechanism was stronger than him.

The elevator jolted. It began to descend.

There was a sickening crunch as his fingers were sheared off by the floor plate.

Four long, pale, severed fingers fell onto the elevator floor. They were twitching.

I watched them twitch all the way down to the lobby. They didn't stop moving until the doors opened again.

I ran. I ran past the sleeping security guard at the front desk, screaming my head off. I ran out into the street. I didn't stop until I saw a police cruiser.

Now I’m here.

The police went upstairs. They were gone for twenty minutes.

When they came down, the lead officer looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance.

""Ma'am,"" he said. ""There’s no one up there.""

""Did you see the webs?"" I asked, grabbing his arm. ""The threads? The blood?""

He shook his head. ""The office is pristine. Cleaning crew must have done a hell of a job. There's no blood. No webs. No giant spider-man.""

""But the fingers!"" I pointed to the elevator. ""The fingers on the floor!""

He sighed. ""We checked the elevator. It’s clean.""

""He took them,"" I whispered. ""He took them back to reattach them.""

""Ma'am, we found a pocket knife on the floor of the hallway. It has... white paint on it. And your own blood. We think maybe you cut yourself and had a panic attack.""

They handed me my knife in an evidence bag. The blade is coated in a dried, white crust. They think it's paint.

I know it's not paint.

So long story short I'm in my building muscles and fat loss era so I was looking for easy and high protein recipes and somehow I stumbled across, mianjin. It's a traditional food used by monks and has a long history behind it. 

Here's where it gets interesting, it has 85 freaking grams of protein per 100g of flour. I'm someone who fills up real easy and hateeeee the texture of seitan. Idc if it's cooked, simmered, steamed... I just hate it because it feels chewy or rubbery and I almost throw up at the texture of it. 

Well the texture of mianjin is nothing like that. You knead wheat gluten with water for like 5-7 mins and cut it in tiny tiny pieces. Smaller than peas because IT WILL PUFF UP. Make sure to close all the cracks like you do with dumplings and pop it in microwave for like 5 mins and bam you're done. Traditionally it's fried in oil so ofc you can try that. 

What I did, tho. I mixed around 10g of cocoa powder, half small spoon coffee, 2 to 3 drop of vanilla essence and 1 spoon sugar in 50g wheat gluten and kneaded it well with almond milk and I HAD THE BEST PUFFS. Now I'm not gonna pretend it's like the commercial puffs but most people will enjoy it and wouldn't want to throw up while they have it so it's a win win ig? :) ",2,1771352856.0,VeganIndia,1,1.0,False

1r7e8ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1r7e8ul/my_idea_for_a_map/,my idea for a map,"So like when I was 7 I had a nightmare where I was in a mall. And there was this big glass elevator. It only went up and had several cars. Any time a car came to a floor, it disappeared behind a metal rib. Anyone inside would come out the other side with missing limbs, until they reached the top floor and they were sprayed with paint to become mannequins. 

Anyways, put that in the center, and more of the same mannequins around. 

The map would have many many many interactable doors that always automatically close. You'd have to open them by shooting a button. The button would be an NPC mercenary pinned to the wall. It'd scream when you shot it and would never die.

There should also be a room that's mostly just a staircase. A dozen or so steps down, there would be water. You'd be able to walk/swim down the stairs until you drowned. It would be deep enough that you probably won't ever see the bottom.

Another nightmare I had when I was a kid was me in a garishly bright green room. There were traffic cones on the floor, each marked with a number. Every time I passed by a number, I would lose a chunk of my leg as if it was rotted away by acid. 

so there should be that. A green room with random damage triggers.

My worst fear is going blind. 

I'm familiar with 3D art and stuff, but not tf2 maps. Would it be possible to have a pitch black box with no collision, expect it's invisible from the outside? That way a player might be able to unknowingly run into it and have their vision go dark. Or maybe, instead of pitch black, it's a bunch of bright sparkles so they think their GPU is dying for a second.

I think the spawn rooms should be large, and all of the lockers should be as far away from the door as possible, to annoy engineers and anyone on fire.

There would also be a manifesto room where it's mostly just long ranting about my unpopular opinions. Don't worry, nothing hateful. Just ""I hate action movies because they enable paranoid chuds that think they're being gangstalked"" and ""I actually support 3D printed food but only if they try to make crazy shit like chicken wings with their sauce name embossed in the skin""

Also I would make tiny invisible bumps in certain parts of the map, so that an Engineer can't place buildings there. I'd also have the only Sniper spots be accessible through a long, winding tunnel of things people wouldn't want to know. Like the lifespan of every dog breed (notably theirs), or the coffee cockroach allergy thing.

Anyone remember Snail Bob? It was a little flash game where you'd control a snail. In the second one, there was this Terminator enemy that scared the shit out of me and I quit playing. Similar story with the Wii Fit Plus's Lotus Focus game. So I'd include homages to both of these things, as well as dozens of examples from other people. 

I also once had a nightmare where my grandpa and I turned into a fish and he chased me through our pool and it was terrifying but I don't know how I could implement that.",1,1771352765.0,tf2,0,1.0,False

Training split:

Mon – Back & biceps

Tue – Abs & core

Wed – Glutes & hams

Thu – Shoulders & triceps

Fri – HIIT

Sat – Quads & glutes

Daily: 10 min incline walk/run

Sun: Brisk walk

Steps: \~5k/day

My diet is pretty clean. I skip breakfast, eat around 100 g protein daily, and try to keep carbs low.

I understand fat loss comes down to calories — I am already eating in a deficit.

Lunch: Lunch is 90 g soya chunks, 1 whole egg + 2 egg whites, salad, and 2 chapatis.

Evening: black coffee with one rusk, and a small banana smoothie pre-workout.

Dinner: 200 g chicken breast with 1 whole egg + 2 egg whites.

I also have one cheat meal every Sunday.

People keep telling me to do more cardio and reduce strength training, but I thought lifting was important for fat loss and muscle retention. I’m confused about what to change now — should I increase steps, add or reduce carbs, take a diet break, or adjust HIIT? Would really appreciate advice from anyone who’s dealt with a fat-loss plateau 🙏💪",2,1771352748.0,Fitness_India,8,1.0,False

I’ve stated getting up early and going on mental health walks and going sitting in cafes, benches in new places. I usually wear headphones but for my mental health and grounding purposes have stopped. But instead it’s just been replaced with the bad attitudes of the UK people

Things I observed today

A man’s phone started to ring- he got it out his pocket literally started pacing forward and backwards and jumping up and down like some cartoon toddler and started screaming ‘why do you never stop fucking ringing’- do people not realise you can silence a phone or cancel calls??

Then I went in to a coffee shop. Someone clearly drank their drink whilst it was hot becauae all you heard was someone shouting ‘for fuck sake can’t even enjoy my fucking drink becauae it’s the temperature of a fucking kettle’. Like yea because it’s just came out of one… ??? 

Then on my way home I was at the road crossing. There is a literal button you press to stop traffic. I was on my way there expecting the man to press the button. He didn’t. He just sat there thinking he was god and that traffic would stop at his demand. It didn’t. Then when I got there the poor thing had been waiting approximately 40 seconds and shockingly traffic had not magically stopped so he started to swear and complain to me about how the traffic here is a joke. Ok… 

I’ll be wearing my headphones for the foreseeable. But seriously. What about any of these situations is bad?? Why would anyone get angry at any of these when all of them can literally be prevented?? I don’t get it.",26,1771352724.0,AskUK,39,0.76,False

Got actual good news yesterday, so that's great, but then I've also got this piece of crap sitting outside my house, and I really don't give a crap anymore, I nearly died the other day, I fainted in the bath, lol. So...

Mandatory military service ruined my life. And something that I found funny was how disgusting I found nice officers to be. Not performatively nice. Like, actually nice officers. Recently, a counselor told me that conscription, or at least my experience of it, sounds like a form of institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but had a radically different experience and never experienced being a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Well, if it was abuse, then any of those officers who weren't abusers were still enablers. My mom will admit that. She'll admit she was. But I love her because she does everything that she can to understand me, now, and help me heal. Anyhow, there was this officer there, Katerina, I'd say she's in her 30s and was all motherly with me. I think what it was is that, like... Because I look like a girl? And I don't mean like a feminine boy, I mean, literally, people joke about me being basically a woman with a you-know-what. I don't care, I grew my hair out now because I refuse to cut it, I feel pretty. Anyway, at one point, my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend, then. Or when she kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber down the road and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long... Or when she gave me her phone number, or sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back...

And looking back, I find her disgusting. I was falling to bits. So a few days ago, I snapped at her over the phone. Yeah, because I just LOVED her bringing me out for boring, stupid walks, going for coffees and as if it meant anything. But she's still friends with my parents, you know? Says that she wants to help me heal, and wants to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Not like a fucking Harley, I mean more like one of these moped things, hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old and all this, but said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

Seriously, I get put through the most disgusting year of my life, being told by her to try and make the best of it, that maybe it's not all bad but just different, trying to be a fucking mom when the one I have is just fine- And for all that shit, I get this shitty bike? And repair work that you're supposed to pretend is rewarding when it's just shit? That's it? That's fucking IT?

A high quality organizer planner can transform scattered intentions into focused action, but only if it is used in a strategic way. In this comprehensive guide you will learn proven methods and habits that help you use a planner consistently, reduce overwhelm, stay motivated, and make progress week after week.

This article not only explains how to set up your planner in a way that works with your lifestyle but also explores the psychology behind staying consistent, tools that support your planning rhythm, and realistic routines that sustain results over time. Whether you are new to planners or looking to improve your system, this guide will help you make planning a habit rather than a failed New Year’s resolution.

# Why Consistency Matters More Than Perfection

Consistency outperforms perfection. Many planner users stop writing after a few weeks because they fall into the trap of trying to make every day look ideal. This leads to frustration when life gets messy or unpredictable. Instead of aiming for flawless pages, a consistent planner practice focuses on steady engagement. You don’t plan perfectly every day. You plan reliably every day. Over time your brain creates a feedback loop where planning feels natural and necessary, not optional or intimidating.

High achievers use planners not because they always stick to the plan but because they always return to it. When you miss a day, your planner should be the tool that helps you recalibrate rather than the thing that makes you feel like a failure. Adopting this mindset is essential to using a planner in a way that actually sticks.

# Choosing the Right Planner Format

There are many types of organizers: daily layouts, weekly, monthly calendars, bullet style journals, and digital planners. The first step toward consistency is choosing a format that fits your workflow. Some people thrive with daily pages that provide space for tasks, habits, schedules, reflections, and priorities. Others prefer weekly layouts that give a bird’s eye view of commitments without feeling cluttered.

Consider how you plan now, how much you want to plan, and what your primary use case is. If you want to track long-term goals, a planner with monthly goal setting pages may be helpful. If your days vary widely in structure, daily pages with time blocking could help create order. Choosing the right format increases the likelihood that you will use it regularly.

# The Science of Habits and Planner Use

Your brain forms habits through repetition and cues. [Planners](https://www.truegether.com/category/business-commercial) become effective when they are part of your routine rather than an occasional activity. Research on habit formation shows that routines anchored to cues can help people stick with changes for weeks and months. For example, pairing planner time with morning coffee or using it immediately after checking your messages conditions your brain to expect planning as part of your day.

Linking planner use to something you already do every day creates consistency without relying solely on motivation. Motivation fluctuates. Systems do not. By integrating your planner into a predictable part of your day, you reduce resistance and make consistency easier.

# Setting Intentions Before Tasks

Many people fill their planners with long lists of tasks without prioritizing what matters most. To stay consistent, start by identifying key intentions for the day, week, or month. Intentions differ from tasks. An intention might be “focus on quality work,” while a task would be “edit three articles.” Intentions keep planning aligned with deeper goals and prevent your schedule from becoming a laundry list of random obligations.

Every planning session should begin with reviewing your intentions. Ask yourself what outcome matters most and shape your tasks around that. This keeps your planner relevant and inspiring, which increases your desire to return to it.

# Time Blocking and Focus Windows

Time blocking is an effective technique to increase focus and consistency. Instead of treating your to-do list as a vague queue of tasks, assign each item a dedicated block of time in your planner. This not only reduces decision fatigue but also forces you to estimate how long things actually take.

When life gets busy, time blocks act as gentle guidelines that remind you where your attention should be. Using focus windows of 30 to 90 minutes helps you build a rhythm. After several weeks of this routine, your planner becomes a reflection of your real work habits rather than an aspirational list you never follow.

# Using Your Planner for Task Review and Adjustment

Consistency does not mean rigidity. Your planner should be a tool you adjust, not a code of laws you must follow. A weekly review helps you reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and what adjustments are needed. Set aside a specific time each week to review your planner, analyze patterns, and plan the next week.

This review session keeps your planner from stagnating and helps you stay aligned with actual progress rather than just intention. Weekly review also encourages self-awareness, which is a key factor in sustained planning practice.

# Tracking Habits With Purpose

Habit tracking is one of the most engaging planner features. It works because it externalizes progress. Instead of trying to remember whether you exercised, meditated, or read, your tracker shows patterns at a glance. Consistency is easier when you see visual evidence of progress.

Choose a few core habits to track instead of a long list. Too many trackers can feel overwhelming and reduce consistency. Focus on changes that support your goals and that you are willing to reinforce daily.

# Making It Enjoyable and Personal

A planner is not a chore. Choose tools, colors, layouts, stickers, or pens that make you look forward to opening it. Personalizing your planner increases engagement because it becomes your space rather than a generic workbook. Some people even link planner use with creativity: doodling, journaling, or adding visual elements that make the process enjoyable.

When planning feels rewarding, you are more likely to do it consistently. A tool that you enjoy interacting with becomes part of your routine rather than something you drag yourself to use.

# Using Digital Tools to Support Physical Planners

Many planner users combine physical planners with digital tools. Apps can remind you of appointments, sync tasks across devices, and store long-term goals that aren’t part of daily pages. Digital calendars can handle alerts while your physical planner handles intention, reflection, and high-level planning.

Using both formats strategically increases consistency because each tool compensates for the other’s weaknesses. Your physical planner becomes the home of intentional planning while digital tools support reminders and notifications.

# Avoiding Common Planning Pitfalls

Many planner users fall into the same traps:

One is trying to plan everything down to the minute. This can make your planner feel overwhelming rather than motivating. Instead, focus on priorities and leave breathing room for flexibility.

Another is ignoring uncompleted tasks. Rather than carrying them forward indefinitely, assess why they were not done. This prevents your planner from becoming a backlog sheet of unfinished items and helps you adjust future plans realistically.

# Incorporating Reflection for Long Term Growth

Reflection is key to staying consistent because it turns experience into insight. Spend a few minutes each day journaling about what worked, what didn’t, and what you can improve tomorrow. Planners with reflection prompts make this easier, but you can add your own prompts if they are not included.

This habit turns your planner into a tool for personal growth, not just task management. When you see planning as part of self-development, consistency naturally follows.

# Planning With Goals and Milestones

Consistency becomes easier when you know why you are planning. Defining goals and breaking them into milestones helps you connect daily actions with outcomes that matter. Without this connection, planning can feel like busywork.

Start with long-term goals, break them into quarterly milestones, then create weekly tasks that contribute to those milestones. When you see how daily actions lead to significant results, your planner becomes a map rather than a to-do list.

# Aligning Your Planner With Your Life Phases

Your planning needs will change over time. At different phases, such as starting a business, caring for family, or studying, your priorities and routines shift. A consistent planner practice adapts rather than rigidly sticks to one system.

Every few months evaluate whether your planner structure still supports your life demands. If not, adjust. This adaptive approach keeps your planning relevant and increases long term consistency.

# Social Accountability and Planning Communities

Sharing your planner goals with supportive friends or communities can increase consistency. When you know someone will ask how your week went or how you are progressing toward goals, you are more likely to stay engaged with your planner.

Online forums, social media groups, and planner meetups can create a sense of accountability that reinforces your routine. Some communities even share layouts, tips, and ideas that keep planning fresh and inspiring.

# Selling Planner Products and Building a Business

For creative entrepreneurs, planners can also become products. If you design and sell planner inserts, stickers, or layouts, consistency in using your own planner becomes part of your brand. Many sellers start with Etsy listings or explore additional ecommerce channels. When listing planner products online you may explore niche markets or alternative marketplaces and even [consider sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) and TrueGether to diversify where your products appear.

# Final Thoughts

A planner becomes powerful when it is used consistently and intentionally. Rather than aiming for a perfect page, focus on building a steady planning habit that supports your priorities and reflects real life. Use reflection, habit tracking, time blocking, and weekly reviews to maintain momentum. Pair your planner with routines that make planning feel natural and enjoyable.

Consistency is not built overnight. It grows through repetition, awareness, and systems that make planning accessible. With the strategies in this guide, you can turn your organizer planner into a tool that strengthens your focus, supports your goals, and becomes a reliable part of your daily life.

First, i have to apologize for my writting, because my english is not my first language, but i will try my best. For the context: I (f) 33 years old have two kids at the age of 11. Married with my husband 42 years old,  for 12 years. We have a islamic lifestile and i wear my hijab for almost 12 years. I dont wear it because of my husband, i wear it because it helped me in difficult times in my life and my belief in Allah saved me. Me and my husband have a habbit to play in a childish way rough, and he usually pays attention to not hurt me. So, while we played and laughed he slapped me on my face and i have told him that it hurt a little. He didnt believe me, so i ASKED him may i show him on his face how it felt for me. He said go on, so i did. Mind you, it was not with full force, just a delicate slap with 10% strenght. It did not go well, and he took it very personaly and told me he doesnt believe me how much he slapped me etc. All the while this happened, he hold my hand (palm) and pressed it with his hand and told me:""I could know squish you right away! and this i wont forgive you!"" I told him, he didnt had to agree to my slap, but while playing it happens to forget how stronger he is. I didnt wanted to argue because my kids witnessed it all. So this is not so tragic for me. We had in our 12 years of marriage some escapade. One time while arguin, he told me that its my fault because his familly(i am speaking of his brother and other cousins) doesnt visit because of me, i am a horrible wife and  i am not doing anything right. Once (i think it was maybe some 5/6  years ago) while arguing-it was a bad fight because i told him NICELY to use the Zebra to cross the streets with kids, and not to go between the cars to cross the street. I wanted to teach my kids safety. He made drama and told me why i was screaming at him, and a wife must not scream at his husband. I said to him, that i dnt apreciate him doing this and to make my effort useless. Kids were at school and we went home, all while he argues with me. I dont know what i am doing wrong, i try to stay a good muslima and i dont want to anger him, but in those situation it hurts me and i tell my feelings and opinions. I am not screaming, maybe sometimes my tone is a little louder.We then went inside and he picked from outside a little branch (for me to slap and to discipline). We came inside and we still argued and i told him to go on and slap me, at least that is something better than the psychical pain he gives me. At the end, and told me he is going to kill me like my father killed my mother. For other context, we were influenced with black magic.Elhamdullilah before 3 years we discovered who did it etc. So i though things are going to change in a positive way. In the last period of time, he is extreme pushy in a negative way. He always tells me, i have to do what every woman does - houskeeping, kids etc. Tells me with criticism why i did not pray and called me with a nickname which has a bad meaning in context of a unbeliever. I just went to the mall with my bestie to drink coffee, because i needed some time away from him, because the last weekend was extremly heavy . While i went back , my kid is calling me on whatsapp and tells me ""why did you forgoten about me mum?"" but i could see his face and his eyes were moving like he is watching someone. Okay so i went inside, and i asked quietly my kids why do they think so ? They told me it was my husband telling my kids that i , as a mother forgets about them. I hugged them, and told them i could never forget about my kids i love them so much. He never apologised for anything, it is mostly I who does the apology even if i am innocent, just to keep the peace. I am visiting school and i am going to study nurse science at september for two years. I am doing as much as i can beside my school. My kids are fine Elhamdullilah and they are going mashalla great at school, and i am so proud of them. The thing is, he is very impulsive when i tell my opinion or if one thing doesnt fit him. I asked him nicely to help me in the househould, he does but with protest and does belove the bare minimum. Even while i worked on the weekends, the house is a mess, and he was all the time at home and playing some games on his phone or watching tv. Just being a sultan. Then he tells me that a man does not have to do this. I am a woman and i am his servant... I could go on and on with things what happened between us. We live in a non islamic state, but we Elhamdulillah adapted good here. My friends are almost in christianity and it was never a problem. He tells me how i should not be friends with non believers only with muslim ppl,  and tells indirectly that ppl like this are making its own grave into dzehennum. Please sisters and brothers, give me some advice what to do, because i am so lost and hurt and angry and i dont want to be a bad person. ",4,1771352560.0,AITAH,6,0.83,False

I’d been up since six. The house felt small.  I made coffee and didn’t drink it. I stood at the kitchen window longer than I meant to, staring across the street. The house looked the same as it always did. Two stories. Pale siding. Wide front windows. The blinds were open today. Sunlight poured in without obstruction.

Empty sunlight.

I told myself I was being dramatic.

I tried to distract myself. I spread the case files across the dining table. Photos. Timelines. Scribbled notes in the margins. Names circled. Dates underlined twice. I’d been obsessing for weeks, barely sleeping, cross-referencing details that probably didn’t need cross-referencing. Every creak in the house made my head snap up. Every passing car made me glance toward the window.

I felt like I’d lost myself in all of this mess.. 

At ten, I was still at it. At eleven, I was pacing.

Around noon, I gave up pretending I could focus.

I opened my laptop and searched the address across the street.

It came up immediately.

Listed for sale. Three years on the market.

There were photos. Bright. Staged. Sterile. The description mentioned structural settling requiring foundation reinforcement. A common issue in older homes in this area. 

The listing explained that the previous owners had relocated suddenly for work and opted to sell as-is rather than complete the repairs. The price reflected it. Still, in a gated community like ours, buyers were cautious. Foundation work scared people.

The listing history showed multiple pending sales, each one canceled after inspection.

Vacant since.

I stared at the screen until the words blurred.

That didn’t make sense.

I had seen him. I had watched him move through the upstairs hallway. I had seen the kitchen light flick on at midnight. I had waved.

For God sake he was at my doorstep?!

I closed the laptop a little too hard.

Just go look, I told myself. Just prove it.

The air outside was cool and sharp. Crossing the street felt surreal, like stepping into a photograph I’d been studying too long. Up close, the house looked normal. No overgrown lawn. No broken windows. Just still. The kind of still that comes from disuse, not neglect.

“What am I doing?” I mumbled as a looked around at my surroundings because entering the front yard, passing the dusty mailbox. 

The blinds were open, just like I’d seen from my window. I stepped closer to the front window and peered inside.

Dust had settled in a thin, undisturbed layer across the hardwood floors. The living room was empty. No furniture impressions. No rugs. No movement. Sunlight illuminated floating particles that had likely been drifting there for months. The air inside looked stale. Unbreathed.

No pictures on the walls. No signs of life.

A prickle crept up my spine.

I shifted slightly along the front of the house, trying to angle my view toward the staircase. For a split second, just a flicker, I thought I saw something shift at the top of the stairs.

I blinked.

Nothing.

Just light and shadow.

“You looking to buy?”

The voice came from behind me, calm but curious.

I turned too fast.

A man stood at the edge of the driveway, hands loosely in his jacket pockets. Mid-thirties, maybe early forties. Neutral expression, though there was a hint of caution in his eyes.

“No. I live across the street.”

He glanced at the house, then back at me. “It’s a nice one. I’m surprised no one’s taken it yet.”

The words hit wrong.

“What do you mean no one’s taken it?” I asked before I could stop myself. “You’re saying nobody lives here?”

He frowned slightly, looking from me to the house as if confirming it was the same one. “Yeah. It’s been vacant for a few years now. Still on the market, to my knowledge.”

“That’s not possible.”

He shifted his weight. “Foundation scared off a few buyers. Structural settling. Nothing dramatic, just expensive. Deals keep falling through after inspection. No one’s stayed.”

I looked back at the house.

A few years.

“That doesn’t even make any sense,” I muttered.

“What doesn’t?”

“I’ve seen someone.”

His eyes sharpened. “Seen someone inside?”

“Upstairs. Lights on at night. Movement.”

He studied my face for a long second, searching for panic or exaggeration. Whatever he found seemed to convince him I believed what I was saying.

“If someone’s been going in and out,” he said slowly, glancing at the house, “I’ll have to report it. Could be teenagers. Could be someone trying to squat.”

My stomach dropped.

He nodded once. “Give me a second.”

Before I could respond, he walked to the front door and pulled a set of keys from his pocket.

“You have keys?”

“I work with the HOA. Maintenance and vacant property checks. We keep tabs on places like this.”

The door opened with a stiff, unused groan.

I stayed where I was as he stepped inside. The house swallowed him. The door remained slightly ajar, revealing the empty foyer and a stretch of bare flooring.

Seconds dragged.

I strained to hear something. Footsteps upstairs. A voice. Anything.

Nothing.

After a couple of minutes, he reappeared and shut the door firmly behind him, locking it with deliberate care.

“It’s exactly the way it was the last time I checked it. Dust, empty rooms, no signs of entry. No one’s been living there.”

The world felt tilted.

He stepped closer, lowering his voice. “If you ever see something again, don’t hesitate to let me know. I’ll handle it.”

He reached into his pocket and handed me a business card.

I looked down at it.

Reading, Daniel Brooks

Community Property Management

As I read the name, he spoke his name out loud, ringing my ears and it sent goosebumps down my arms and legs. 

“My name’s Daniel, by the way.”

My breath caught.

I looked up at him, stunned.

He didn’t seem to notice. Just nodded once.

“I live two houses down. If anything feels off, call me.”

*Daniel*

When I looked back at him, he was already walking away, hands in his pockets, casual, unbothered. Just another neighbor heading home.

I turned slowly toward the house again.

Vacant for years.

No one inside.

Foundation issues. Failed inspections. Dust.

My mind replayed every night I’d watched that window. Every time I’d sworn someone was there. Every movement. Every light. Every silhouette.

The certainty I had clung to began to rot from the inside.

If no one lived there, then I had been staring into an empty house for weeks.

Smiling at nothing.

Waving at nothing.

Talking to nothing.

A cold realization settled into my bones.

If the house had been empty this whole time, then whatever I saw was never inside it.

And slowly, painfully, I became aware of something else.

All those nights I thought I was watching that house. There were moments I felt watched back. Not from across the street. From somewhere closer. From somewhere inside my own home.

I swallowed hard and looked back at my house, lifting my eyes to my bedroom window. The curtain was slightly parted. I never leave it open.

At first, I told myself it was the wind, but the trees were still. The air was still. Nothing else in the neighborhood moved.

Then I saw it.

A shape behind the glass. Faint. Almost blending into the dimness of the room. Standing exactly where I would stand. Right at the window. Facing the street.

Facing me.

My heart stuttered in my chest. I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. Because the longer I stared, the clearer it became.

It wasn’t just a shape.

It was my outline.

The slope of my shoulders. The fall of my hair.

Standing in my bedroom.

Watching me stand in the street.

A cold, sick understanding began to settle in.

If I was out here…

Then who was in there?

And just as the thought fully formed, the figure in the window slowly lifted its hand.

I REMEMBER the beginning of Ramadan last year: the festive supermarkets with their jampacked aisles, the makeshift roadside stalls outside restaurants selling crisp sambusas and subiya, the sounds of Adhan emanating from Masajid…

My house overlooked a Maghsalat-Al-Amwaat Al-Khairiyyah (a charitable organization which prepares bodies for burial in the Islamic manner), and as I walked home from the neighborhood supermarket laden with packages of food and other essentials in preparation of the next day’s fast, I caught sight of a family accompanying a bier in a hearse. The women huddled together, sobbing quietly, while the men stood at a distance in somber silence.

It struck me: While I was going home to the comfort of my home and the company of my family, this person was being dispatched alone, to answer the stern questioning of the grave. While I would be given the opportunity to fast and perform other deeds as Allah willed, this person, who had been given the same opportunity in past years, had been deprived of it this year.

Our Imam and Khateeb, may Allah preserve him, used to remind the congregants of the favors of Allah in allowing us to witness yet another Ramadan, by contrasting our state with those of the people of the graves, who would gladly give the world and all that is in it if they could, in lieu of the chance to worship Allah a little more, to add the tiniest good deeds to their scale that would enable them to draw closer to Paradise and take them further away from the Fire.

In a khutbah, the Imam, may Allah preserve him, said: **“Whoever remembers death frequently is honored with three things: hastening towards repentance, contentment and energy in performing acts of worship; and whoever forgets death is punished with three things: delaying repentance, lack of contentedness and laziness in acts of worship.”**

With the current conflict in Palestine, it is no wonder that our thoughts naturally turn to death and dying.

Unlike some belief systems which consider the contemplation of death “inauspicious” or “macabre”, Muslims are encouraged to regularly remind themselves and others about the inevitable end of life, and what awaits a person in the Hereafter.

The Prophet ﷺ once stood at the edge of a grave and called out to his Companions: **“O my brothers! For this, prepare yourselves.”** (Ibn Majah) and in another narration, he said: **“O people! Remember often the destroyer of pleasures: death** .” (Al-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa’i, Ibn Majah)

Once a man asked the Prophet ﷺ, **“ Who is the wisest among the people, O Messenger of Allah?” He replied: “The one who remembers death most often and the one who is best prepared to meet it. These are the truly wise, honored in this life and distinguished in the Hereafter .”** (Ibn Majah, Al-Tabarani).

The remembrance of death acquires a special significance with the advent of Ramadan, since it is the season of Hope and Blessings and an opportunity to earn innumerable rewards that can be reaped eternally, which is open to everyone equally.

Yet, many of us greet Ramadan with a sense of complacent déjà vu, a “been-there, done-that” lassitude, that could cost us dearly. Let’s face it: for many of us Ramadan has turned into a time for socializing with friends and extended family, spending hours preparing and sampling traditional dishes, watching TV sitcoms from Iftar to Isha – to the extent that we even spend the precious nights of Ramadan in auto-pilot mode, performing our prayers perfunctorily before hitting the supermarkets, malls, coffee shops and Internet cafes to shop or while the night away.

Somewhere at the back of our minds is the assurance that there’s always next year – or a succession of years – to count on, when we will magically have the “Ramadan of our dreams” with plenty of time to read the Qur’an, stand in prayer at night, seek forgiveness in the early morning hours, serve the ailing and poor, be hospitable to our neighbors and friends.

However, the sad truth is that as the years pass by, our energy and health dissipates and our responsibilities and distractions increase exponentially, distancing us from the mirage of the perfect Ramadan even further… until it may be too late.

The Prophet ﷺ advised us: **“Hasten to do good deeds before you become busy. Are you waiting for such straitened circumstances which will make you unmindful of devotion? Or such prosperity which will make you corrupt? Or such disease which will disable you? Or such senility which will make you mentally unstable? Or sudden death? Or the Dajjaal (Anti-Christ), who is the worst apprehended (sign of the Hour)? Or (are you waiting) for the Hour? That will be most grievous and bitter** .” (Al-Tirmidhi)

We have no guarantees that we will live to see another Ramadan, let us seize each blessing with eagerness and each opportunity to earn rewards with enthusiasm, to make this the best Ramadan of our lives.",1,1771351931.0,MuslimLounge,0,1.0,False

I've been researching vacuum and mopping robots for weeks now and I feel more lost than ever.

  
Here's my situation:

I live in a small 1 room apartment (30 sqm). Mainly hard floor, 2 very tiny carpets, nothing higher than 1cm to overcome, all in one floor.

Main issue: many, many long hair everywhere - so I need a robot that can handle that on a daily basis without lots of tangling or maintenance in this regard.

A somewhat decent mopping performance would be nice. I don't have kids or pets, I just spill coffee, tea or herbs which all dry on the floor.

My apartment is tiny and there is not that much space to navigate, so a compact device and also a compact station would be lovely. And I have a lot of plants on the floor (like literally the leaves are growing along the floor, cables and other obstacles, so good obstacle handling is a plus).

My budget is around 400€, I'm based in Germany.

I've been eying the **Ecovacs Deebot mini** for its size, but I'm not sure if it'll be powerful enough especially in terms of hair. It's the cheapest among all of the ones I've come across.

I love the station design of the **Narwall Freo X10 Pro**.  
I read that it's mopping performance is great, but it struggles with hair and obstacle avoidance. If that's really true, I suppose I cannot go for that one. Anyone has it and can comment on this?   
Currently runs at 399€ in Germany, so it's just within my budget.

The **Dreame L40 Ultra AE** looks quite promising. I just don't like how huge / tall the station looks ... also, currently it's above my budget, would have to wait for a deal or buy a refurbed version. It seems to do quite well with long hair?

I also love the station design of the **Mova P50 Pro Ultra**. It seems to be very similar to the Dreame one. It also should perform well with longer hair.  
Just like the Dreame it's currently above my budget unfortunately.

  
Which one would you recommend for my use case or is there any other one I overlooked, that could fit well? :)

Up for grabs is my homey space in a very homey apartment set one block away from McGolrick Park. The room is about 12x14 with an exposed brick fireplace (non-working) with a mantle/alter above, queen-sized bed with a new Wright Mattress (amazing boutique mattress company in SoHo), a 42"" Toshiba Smart TV, 2 east-facing windows (LOTS of sunlight), computer desk with 2 monitors and an old OG Eames chair, a dresser, nightstand, lots of books, couple surfboards, and a generally calming energy!

I've got storage space for your clothing, shoes, and some closet space as well.

I share the space with a mid-40'sM antique interior reconstruction, who is typically only around about 30% of the month.



Our space is a pretty nurturing one and relatively zen with lots of natural light, what is essentially a greenroom in the shared living space with a couch, chair, record player, table, etc., and a decent sized kitchen with a newish fridge, large table for preparing meals, and basics (sink, oven, etc.). We have one bathroom which is not gigantic, but fine in its own right.

We have newly installed baseboard heating throughout - though it needs to be turned off when leaving apt, as it’s electric and PRICEY. I've recently had new windows installed for what that's worth - it’s helped heaps with sound and temperature insulation.





My roommate and I all get along very well, though we also enjoy our space as well.

This is an older Brooklyn apartment with a fair amount of real character. If you're looking for a new high-rise style space, keep it movin!

Nearby/within 3 min walk: Little Dokebi Korean bbq, Variety Coffee, hip McGolrick Park, Crema Coffee, Campbells, Pie Corps, The Esthers, Diamond Lil, Lovebirds, Palace, Minnows, Goldies, The Drift, and Buttery Bar. Five Leaves, Crissy’s pizza. McCarren Park, and G train are about 8 min walk.

Anyway, the other day, I got the idea to add this tsp to my coffee grounds, while they were steeping in hot water. I figured that the slight addition of ethanol would extract a little bit of the water-insoluble elements from the coffee. It's similar to a penne alla vodka... cafe alla vodka I guess.

Last Monday I unexpectedly saw my ex on the bus. We hadn’t seen or talked to each other in 6 months (except two months ago when I congratulated him on graduating — just a polite message).

We were together for 4 years (from age 20 to almost 25). We didn’t break up because the love disappeared, but because we kept arguing and misunderstanding each other. The breakup was painful and a bit traumatic, and after that we basically stopped talking.

The last time we saw each other before this was at a party 6 months ago. He told me he missed me a lot, missed my family, and was having a hard time moving on, but he never suggested getting back together. I acted distant at the time because I knew he was going out and meeting other girls. After that, silence again.

Then last week on the bus he greeted me using the affectionate nickname he used when we were together. We talked warmly for about 7 minutes before he got off. He asked about my dog — and showed me a sticker of my dog I had given him during the relationship. He still keeps it on his phone case after 9 months. I didn’t overthink it, just laughed and we hugged goodbye.

That afternoon I realized I still had unresolved feelings and needed closure. Not to get back together — but to know and to feel like a did something. So I texted him that night:

“Hey, I didn’t expect to see you today haha. I was thinking we could grab a coffee and catch up — every time we meet we have so little time. For the good memories :) let me know""

No pressure, no drama.

He didn’t reply for 7 days.

At that point I already understood the answer was basically no.

Then a week later he texted:

“Hello Prrip (the affectionate nickname when we were together) Sorry for the delay haha, I’m always late replying. I’d be up for a coffee to catch up. for the good memories :)”

But by then something changed in me. The silence gave me clarity. I realized he wasn’t prioritizing me and probably hadn’t for a long time. I realized I was the only one stuck in this relationship and I was still in love with someone that it's not the same.

So I decided not to answer.

Not out of pride — out of closure.

I feel brave.

It hurt, because I honestly would have gone to that coffee happily. But I needed to take him off the pedestal and accept reality.

Why am I posting this?

    1.	For opinions — honesty is welcome.
    
    2.	For anyone thinking about meeting an ex: sometimes doing it helps you finally see things clearly.

It doesn’t always go how you hope.

But sometimes you need one action to truly move on.

 — Nostalgia Trap ㅡ


---


~Valentine’s Day, earlier~


Lu Guang does not like dates.

Not calendar ones, not symbolic ones, not the kind that come pre-loaded with expectations and cheap decorations. Dates make patterns obvious. Patterns become memories. Memories become questions.

Valentine’s Day is especially dangerous.

He notices it in the smallest ways first: the color pink bleeding into shop windows, heart-shaped stickers slapped onto glass like afterthoughts, a couple laughing too loudly on the street, their hands brushing without fear.

Moments like these are loud.

They echo.

Lu Guang pretends not to hear them.

He stops in front of a photograph pinned near the back of the red room.

An old one. Faded at the edges.

A beach.

The horizon slightly crooked. The light too warm to be accidental.

The photo hums with familiarity.

Sand.

Wind.

Laughter.

His fingers hover, then touch the corner of the photo.

The image doesn’t change.

It never does.

But his thoughts spiral anyway.


I’ve been here before... This photo is from the three timelines ago. Right before Xiaoshi died in my arms... 


He looks at the photo closer. Cheng Xiaoshi was smiling brightly while running on the sand. Lu Guang refuses to tear his eyes away from the photo until he memorises every inch of the photo.

I want to see his smile again... I want him to have fun like careless kids again...

The beach exists outside of control.
No walls. No corners. No shadows to hide edits in.
It’s where moments breathe.

And that’s exactly why he shouldn’t want to go back.

---

“Lu Guang?”

Cheng Xiaoshi’s voice pulls him out of it. Warm, careless, alive. He’s leaning against the doorframe, phone in hand, already halfway into some terrible idea.

“What’s with the haunted look?” Cheng Xiaoshi asks. “Did you see a ghost, or is it just Valentine’s Day again?”

Lu Guang exhales slowly. “Neither.”

Cheng Xiaoshi grins. “Liar.”

Lu Guang looks at him, really looks. The way he always does when he’s trying not to.

The way Cheng Xiaoshi fills space without trying. The way he makes silence feel optional. The way the present bends around him like it wants him here.

And suddenly, the decision isn’t logical anymore.

It’s instinct. He wants to, no, he needs to see him on that beach having fun again. His smile, oh his smile... Lu Guang was addicted to it.

“We should go out,” Lu Guang blurts out suddenly.

Cheng Xiaoshi freezes. “…What.”

“The beach,” Lu Guang adds, before he can stop himself.

The words feel like stepping on a loose tile.

Cheng Xiaoshi’s eyes light up instantly. “HELLO?? On Valentine’s Day?? Who are you and what have you done to Lu Guang???”

Lu Guang doesn’t answer. He’s already watching the future in fragments, testing possibilities he refuses to name.


I'm changing the past again... I shouldn't change anything. I'm not sticking to the last timeline's events. This didn't happen in the last timeline. Will this ruin everything? Will everything change? What if he drowns in the beach or something?


He bites his tongue, wishing he never talked in the first place.


I can't help it... I can't resist the urge... He deserves some fun, right? Nothing bad could happen from going to a beach, right? Right?.. 
...
I definitely broke this timeline too. But I just want to see him there. One more time. Without interference. Without correction. Without trying to stick to the script.

---


The beach is where Cheng Xiaoshi laughs without checking who’s watching.
Where the wind steals his words and he doesn’t chase them back.
Where moments don’t ask to be saved.
Lu Guang doesn’t want to change anything today.
He just wants to remember why he keeps trying.

Cheng Xiaoshi grabs his jacket, already halfway out the door.

“C’mon,” he says. “If this is some secret mastermind plan, at least let it involve snacks.”

Lu Guang follows.

He tells himself this isn’t a mistake.

But nostalgia is a trap for a reason.


---


~Beach, late afternoon~


The sea is loud. Constant. Honest in a way time never is.

Cheng Xiaoshi kicks off his shoes immediately like he’s allergic to responsibility. Sand sticks to his shorts. He doesn’t care.

Lu Guang notices everything. He hates that he does.

The beach is a terrible place for thoughts.

Too open. Too many variables.

Cheng Xiaoshi runs ahead, arms out, letting the wind bully his jacket. He turns back, grinning, salt in his hair, sunlight stuck in his eyes like it belongs there.

He always looks like this, Lu Guang thinks. Like the world hasn’t decided to hurt him yet.

The way Cheng Xiaoshi laughs isn’t measured. It spills. It ignores consequence. It doesn’t check the future first.

Lu Guang has corrected dozens of moments. Thousands, maybe.

But this, this is one moment he never wants to touch.

Cheng Xiaoshi crouches to write something in the sand, immediately ruins it by kicking water over it.

Lu Guang watches his hands.

Strong. Reckless. Alive.


If I step closer, he thinks, will this feeling solidify?

If I step back, will it disappear?

Neither option feels safe.

---

Cheng Xiaoshi tells from the ocean suddenly, “HEY LU GUANG. IF I GET SWEPT INTO THE OCEAN, SAVE ME.”

Lu Guang deadpans, “Statistically unlikely.”

Cheng Xiaoshi pouts, “WOW. BETRAYAL.” He then splashes water in Lu Guang’s direction. Lu Guang dodges, barely. His sleeve gets wet.

He should be annoyed.
...
He isn’t.

This is it, Lu Guang realizes, horrified.
This is the moment.
Not the disasters.
Not the blood.
Not the rewinds.
This.

Cheng Xiaoshi standing in the surf, yelling his name like it’s the most natural thing in the world. Like Lu Guang is a constant. Like he’s not something temporary.

I don’t want to change this, he thinks.
I don’t want to optimize it.
I don’t want to save him from it.
He wants to stay.

The realization settles heavy and warm and terrifying in his chest.

This is love, Lu Guang thinks, and immediately hates how irreversible that word feels.

---

The sun starts dipping. Valentine’s pink bleeds into the sky.

Cheng Xiaoshi jogs back, breathing hard, smiling like he’s won something.

Cheng Xiaoshi, “Okay, beach verdict: 10/10. Would romanticize again.”

Lu Guang looks at him for a second too long, “…Yes.”

Cheng Xiaoshi squints, “You’re being weird.”

Lu Guang turns away, heart absolutely sprinting.

I can’t say it here, he thinks.

Not with the ocean watching.
Not with this much history in the air.
But the decision is already made.

---


~Time Photo Studio, evening~


The shop is quiet in that weird, heavy way it gets after sunset. The neon outside flickers once, twice. Valentine’s Day decorations are still taped crookedly on the window; cheap hearts, faded pink.

Cheng Xiaoshi is sitting on the couch, aggressively eating convenience store chocolate. Starving after the beach adventure.

""This chocolate sucks."" He exclaims to break the awkward silence. ""Why does Valentine’s Day exist anyway? Capitalism AND romance? Pick a struggle.""

Lu Guang is standing near the photo wall, arms crossed as if to build a protector wall in front of himself.
Not sitting.
Not moving.
Just… existing wrong.
Inside his head, it’s chaos.


Okay.
Breathe.

If I say it, do I break something?
If I don’t say it, do I break something?
If I say it and nothing happens, will I regret keeping quiet?
If I say it and everything happens… will I know how to fix it?

If I confess today—
No.
Bad idea.
If I don’t confess—
Also bad idea.
If I confess, will this moment overwrite something?
Have I already seen a future where this goes wrong?
Or did I rewind before I could see it?


He has rewound time for Cheng Xiaoshi so many times that his sense of “now” is basically duct-taped together.

One sentence.
One variable.
One possible disaster.


He rehearses a confession in his head until the sentences smell like burnt toast.


Option A: Say “I like you.” Catastrophic timeline branching.

Option B: Say “I like you” but in a clever metaphor. Less branching? Unsure.

Option C: Don’t say anything and pretend feelings are a coffee stain you can ignore. Also catastrophic, but quieter.


Every memory of Cheng Xiaoshi folds over itself, sharper at the edges: the way he tilts his head when he’s suspicious of a bad photo, the stupid grin when he pulls a prank, the little sound he makes when he eats too fast. Lu Guang catalogues them like evidence, like variables, like things that could explode.

What if one sentence shifts something microscopic; a scrape of a hand, a delay at a crosswalk and that tiny delay unravels a whole future?

What if saying “I like you” means he’ll read a different flash tomorrow and he can’t fix it because some things aren’t reversible?

He imagines futures like a person browsing awful fan edits: some are pastel and wholesome, some are black and white with static and a door closing. He’s tired of the static ones.

Lu Guang’s breath gets sharp and shallow, like he’s been sprinting without moving.

---


Cheng Xiaoshi notices the tremor in Lu Guang’s hand when he reaches for a polaroid.

“You look like you’re about to drop a truth bomb or confess to stealing my socks. Which?”

“Neither.”

He’s lying. He’s been lying for years. About Cheng Xiaoshi's death. About timelines. About everything. But he’s never practised lying about his beating chest.

If I confess and the wrong thing happens…
If I don’t confess and the wrong thing happens…

He makes a joke inside his head to steady himself. The joke is awful. He still laughs at it.


Lu Guang opens his mouth. The words retreat. He breathes out a random fact about film development instead.

Cheng Xiaoshi, “Dude. If this is about film chemistry, say so. If it’s about feelings, say that. If it’s about both, also say that.”

Lu Guang forgets how to talk for a second, “I—”

“I don’t want to cause you trouble... Lu Guang, say something!..""

You’re already causing me trouble from inside my chest, a tiny part of his mind mutters, and he wants to whack it.

He thinks of all the times how a tiny thing rewrote the whole future; a blink, a footstep, a throat clearing and how those tiny edits had dominoes that went farther than he expected. Regret tastes bitter in his mouth.

What if liking him is the domino that knocks everything into a place I can’t fix?

His hands curl into fists. His fingers leave pale crescents in his palms.

Cheng Xiaoshi, sensing the dramatic weather system forming over Lu Guang, drops his chocolate and becomes theatrical.

Cheng Xiaoshi, “Are you about to confess to murder, feelings, or an overwhelming love of ugly sweaters?”

Lu Guang manages a dry laugh that’s almost a sob. That laugh costs him two futures he doesn’t want to lose.

His thoughts spiral again...


You’ve corrected physics with a photograph. You’ve been the emergency brake on fate before. But confession? That’s not a wound you can stitch while the world watches.

Every iteration of ‘I love you’ I invent in my head is a hypothesis. Hypotheses can be wrong. Hypotheses can kill things that were fine.


He imagines timelines like fragile jars on a shelf. He’s been the person rearranging jars for safety, but he’s never put his hand on the shelf and whispered a jar’s name. Now he wants to whisper the loudest jar of all.

What if telling him makes the jar slip because of the weight of the word?

What if not telling him keeps him alive but also keeps him lonely?


The moral calculus is sloppy. He does the math anyway.

He thinks of qualities he wants to protect: Cheng’s laugh, Cheng’s stupid stubbornness, the way Cheng trusts him more than he trusts himself. He decides he’ll risk the jar.

---

Lu Guang steps forward in a motion that feels both like falling and like choosing.

Lu Guang starts with a small voice, “I—”

“I like you. I like you so much it’s… it’s stupid. It’s dangerous. I keep wondering if loving you is the one mistake I haven’t undone yet. It’s everything I try to keep in a box.”

He stops. The words have weight. They sit between them like a polaroid drying.

God, he thinks, saying that felt like opening a floodgate and a safe at the same time.

Cheng Xiaoshi’s mouth does the thing it does when he’s processing, “You… like me?”

Lu Guang wants to deny but fails, ""No. I mean yes... But no. You know what? Screw it! I love you, Cheng Xiaoshi. Not casually. Not temporarily. I like you in a way that doesn’t disappear when time moves forward. But I’m terrified because I don’t know if saying that will change something bad or something good.” He swallows. He keeps the parts about rewinding and death and the actual mechanics buried behind teeth. He isn’t ready to give Cheng that much; some truths are his to carry. And he is starting to get crushed under the weight.

Silence.
The clock ticks.
This moment feels fragile. Like glass.

Cheng Xiaoshi’s brain blue-screens at first. ""…Oh.""

Lu Guang braces himself. You can see it. ""You don’t have to say anything. I just... I didn’t want this day to pass without being honest.""

And then...

Cheng Xiaoshi suddenly laughs. Not mocking, it was soft. Nervous. ""Dude. First of all, that’s the most unhinged romantic confession I’ve ever heard.""

He stands up too.

They’re close now. Way too close.

""You realize I’ve been in love with you for, like… forever, right?""

Lu Guang freezes. ""…What?""

""Yeah. I just thought you’d never feel the same, so I played dumb.""

A beat passes. A moment of silence.

""Turns out we’re both idiots."" Cheng Xiaoshi continues.

Lu Guang’s shoulders drop, relief hitting him all at once. He exhales like he’s been holding his breath for years.

---

Lu Guang reaches out, hesitates, then gently takes Cheng Xiaoshi’s hand.

""Happy Valentine’s Day, Xiaoshi.""

""Wow. How uncharacteristically romantic of you."" Cheng Xiaoshi teases. ""So this is what romance feels like. Terrifying. Kinda awesome though.""

Lu Guang wants to smile. He thinks smiling might be a micro-change that causes a butterfly effect, but the comfort of Cheng’s presence steadies him.

Lu Guang’s inner monologue, softer now: If this is the jar that falls, let it fall. I’ll pick up shards later.

---

They stand there, hand in hand, as the neon light outside flickers again, a moment finally worth staying in.

The confession didn’t fix everything. It didn’t promise anything except an attempt. But it was said. That alone feels like theft and salvation rolled into one.

These two people will now risk tiny changes for something that might be worth all the chaos.

Outside, the neon light flickers.

But the moment doesn’t break.

We were together for 4 years (from age 20 to almost 25). We didn’t break up because the love disappeared, but because we kept arguing and misunderstanding each other. The breakup was painful and a bit traumatic, and after that we basically stopped talking.

The last time we saw each other before this was at a party 6 months ago. He told me he missed me a lot, missed my family, and was having a hard time moving on, but he never suggested getting back together. I acted distant at the time because I knew he was going out and meeting other girls. After that, silence again.

Then last week on the bus he greeted me using the affectionate nickname he used when we were together. We talked warmly for about 7 minutes before he got off. He asked about my dog — and showed me a sticker of my dog I had given him during the relationship. He still keeps it on his phone case after 9 months. I didn’t overthink it, just laughed and we hugged goodbye.

That afternoon I realized I still had unresolved feelings and needed closure. Not to get back together — but to know and to feel like a did something. So I texted him that night:

“Hey, I didn’t expect to see you today haha. I was thinking we could grab a coffee and catch up — every time we meet we have so little time. For the good memories :) let me know""

No pressure, no drama.

He didn’t reply for 7 days.

At that point I already understood the answer was basically no.

Then a week later he texted:

“Hello Prrip (the affectionate nickname when we were together) Sorry for the delay haha, I’m always late replying. I’d be up for a coffee to catch up. for the good memories :)”

But by then something changed in me. The silence gave me clarity. I realized he wasn’t prioritizing me and probably hadn’t for a long time. I realized I was the only one stuck in this relationship and I was still in love with someone that it's not the same.

So I decided not to answer.

Not out of pride — out of closure.

I feel brave.

It hurt, because I honestly would have gone to that coffee happily. But I needed to take him off the pedestal and accept reality.

Why am I posting this?

    1.	For opinions — honesty is welcome.
    
    2.	For anyone thinking about meeting an ex: sometimes doing it helps you finally see things clearly.

It doesn’t always go how you hope.

But sometimes you need one action to truly move on.

1r7dcfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1r7dcfl/coming_off_amlodipine_looking_for_success_stories/,Coming off amlodipine – looking for success stories & advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice and real-world experiences from people who have successfully come off amlodipine or managed blood pressure without long-term medication.

I’m 46 years old, male, currently \~175 lbs and actively losing weight, and I train Brazilian jiu-jitsu regularly along with general exercise. I was on amlodipine 7.5 mg for about 8 years, but my PCP recently advised me to stop it for 2 weeks and monitor BP due to side effects (blood pooling/bruising).

Since stopping, my readings have been borderline but not consistently high, mostly in the low–mid 130s systolic and mid-80s diastolic, with occasional higher readings (especially at night). I’m measuring properly (rested, seated, arm at heart level) and logging everything.

Additional context:

	•	Actively losing weight and improving fitness

	•	No stimulants at all (no coffee, energy drinks, or pre-workout)

	•	Currently in a structured calorie deficit and losing weight gradually as part of a long-term plan to improve BP and overall health

	•	Train jiu-jitsu regularly

	•	Some anxiety history and recent medication adjustments

	•	Trying to avoid restarting meds unless truly necessary

My questions:

	•	If you’ve come off amlodipine, what helped stabilize your BP?

	•	How long did rebound effects last, if you experienced them?

	•	Were lifestyle changes enough for you, or did you switch to a different medication?

	•	Any tips for staying objective and not overreacting to individual readings during the monitoring phase?

Not looking for medical advice — just personal experiences and perspectives. Thanks in advance.",1,1771350926.0,hypertension,1,1.0,False

Open sourcing the project anyway with $160 in bounties.Built with Claude.,"**Porquoi mon ami?**

I've been building a desktop dashboard for Claude Code called [Claudetini](https://github.com/CantinaDigital/claudetini), built entirely with Claude Code. It tracks your sessions, shows your roadmap progress, runs health checks on  your projects. Basically kills the ""where was I?"" problem between sessions. If you're like me and overshoot the [Ballmer Peak](https://xkcd.com/323/) every now and again, this should help. 

I was going to submit it to the Claude 4.6 hackathon, but the registration required *thoughtful* responses and I couldn't use AI to write them. So missed the deadline.

Instead of crying about it, I'm open sourcing the project and putting up my own money as bounties. If u/claudeofficial wants to be cool and throw me some credits, awesome. If not, not awesome. 

**TL:DR at the bottom, lad/ys.** 

────────────────────────────────────────

**What can you actually do with it?**

If you just installed Claude Code:

* Open the app and it auto-discovers your projects from \~/.claude/ — no setup
* Get a readiness scorecard (0-100) that checks 14+ things: missing CLAUDE.md? No .gitignore? Secrets in your repo? Each check tells you why it matters and how to fix it
* Click one button to bootstrap everything you're missing — [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md), ROADMAP, architecture docs, .gitignore. Claude  generates it all with a cost estimate upfront

If you use Claude Code daily:

* Dispatch tasks with live streaming: type a prompt, watch Claude work in real-time (actual CLI output, not fake progress  bars), get a git diff preview when it's done
* Quality gates catch problems before they hit your repo: secrets scanning, test runner, linter, type checker. Each configurable as hard-stop or advisory
* Auto-reconciliation matches your git changes to roadmap items after every session and offers to check them off. No more manually updating your own todo list

**If you're running large projects:**

* **Parallel agent execution using git worktree**s: select a milestone, an AI planner breaks it into themed batches, spins up  isolated worktrees, and runs multiple Claude agents simultaneously — each in its own branch, no conflicts. Auto-merges when done
* Multi-provider fallback: hit Claude's token limit? The app offers to re-run via Codex CLI or Gemini CLI without losing context
* Smart scheduling: DND mode queues dispatches, editor conflict detection pauses if VS Code is actively writing, auto-resumes when safe

────────────────────────────────────────

**But does it actually follow best practices?**

Boris (the creator of Claude Code (@bcherny?)) recently shared 10 tips from the team. [Claudetini](https://github.com/CantinaDigital/claudetini) automates 6 of them out of the box:

**Boris tips**: 

* Parallel with git worktrees (""the single biggest productivity unlock"")
   * What Claudetini does: Select a milestone, Claudetini spins up worktrees automatically, runs agents in parallel,  auto-merges when done
* Plan before you execute
   * What Claudetini does: AI generates a phased execution plan with agent assignments and success criteria. You review and  approve before anything runs
* Invest in your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)
   * What Claudetini does: Scorecard flags if yours is missing. Bootstrap generates one in a click. Prompt enricher reads it on  every dispatch so Claude always has your conventions
* Reduce ambiguity in prompts
   * What Claudetini does: Prompt enrichment auto-injects code conventions, relevant files, component structure, and design patterns — you write a short prompt, Claude gets a detailed spec
* Use subagents
   * What Claudetini does: Parallel execution breaks milestones into themed agent batches with dependency-aware phasing
* Learn with Claude
   * What Claudetini does: Two bundled demo projects with a step-by-step walkthrough — watch your readiness score climb from 10 to 90+ as you learn.
* I didn't build these features because of Boris's tips. I just found out we overlap. Take that as validation or coincidence, your call.

  
────────────────────────────────────────

Don't have a project yet? We ship two mini-projects so you can learn.

The repo includes two curated demo projects in examples/ — run one setup script and you're exploring the dashboard in under a minute.

**Project: recipe-cli**

Level: Beginner

What you'll learn: A small Python CLI with intentional problems. No git repo, no docs, a hardcoded AWS key, an exposed .env file. Your readiness score  starts at \~10/100. A step-by-step GETTING\_STARTED.md walkthrough guides you through fixing each issue and watching your score climb to 90+. Great if  you're new to Git or Claude Code.

────────────────────────────────────────

**Project: devlog**

Level: Intermediate

What you'll learn: A FastAPI app with 15 realistic commits, a roadmap at \~55% progress, mixed quality gate results, and dirty git state (staged changes, untracked files, a stash entry). Open it and the full dashboard lights up immediately — overview, roadmap, timeline, gates, reconciliation.

`bash examples/setup_demos.sh`

That's it. Then open [Claudetini](https://github.com/CantinaDigital/claudetini) and add the project folder.

────────────────────────────────────────

**Why this exists:**

Every Claude Code session starts from zero. Your context is gone, your progress is scattered across JSONL files nobody reads, and you're one bad prompt away from undoing an hour of work with no way to know until it's too late.

[Claudetini](https://github.com/CantinaDigital/claudetini) gives you the persistent layer Claude Code doesn't have: project health at a glance, quality gates that actually enforce standards, a session history that means you never lose track of where you were, and parallel execution that lets you ship a full milestone while you grab coffee.

If you've ever opened Claude Code and thought *what was I working on?* This is for you. If you've ever let Claude nuke a file and wished something had stopped it, maybe this is for you. And if you've ever stared at a wall of JSON wondering what your last session actually did, then yeah, this is for you.

────────────────────────────────────────

**The Stack**:

Tauri 2 desktop app: React 19 frontend, Python FastAPI sidecar, 30+ core modules. It reads from ~/.claude/ to give you persistent project awareness across sessions. Built with Claude Code (Opus 4.5/4.6). Free and open source.

────────────────────────────────────────

**Launch Bounties ($160)**:

With AI, anyone can ship a feature. What's actually hard to get is quality. That's why review gets the bigger prize.

Prize: $60 : Best PR

How you win: Add a feature, fix a bug, improve the app.  Or you figure out how to intelligently switch between models and LLMs. The community votes, most 👍 on your PR wins.

Prize: $100 : Best Code Review

How you win: Leave helpful, constructive feedback on *other people's* PRs. Catch bugs, suggest fixes, flag issues. Most upvoted reviewer wins.

**Deadline: Monday, February 23**.

I googled GLP and vision and it’s a serious thing apparently related to blood sugar. People have woken up completely blind. I went to the coffee station and made some sugar water and shot it down and in about 15 minutes it cleared and hasn’t been back all day. 

It was pretty scary. I have been on Reta for about 12 weeks. I haven’t elevated my dose in about 6 weeks. I did eat a very low amount of carbs yesterday. I usually do on rest days. I measure my blood sugar and ketones and if it is a couple of hours after eating I am always in ketosis. Even if I have 200-300 grams of carbs. I’ll still get ketones of about 0.4-0.5. 

None of that is the weirdest part though. My vision is crystal clear now. I don’t have to squint to read anything close to my face and can read lettering from far away.

•  Hashrate still humming at 49.47 TH/s (50 TH/s dream getting closer every upgrade!)

•  Efficiency locked in at 15 W/TH – love how efficient these digital miners stay

•  Rewards? Dripping in BTC daily like clockwork. Doesn’t care if the price is $68k or $100k—the sats pile up passively, and that’s the magic for me.

These sideways/lower phases are honestly kinda nice for long-term folks. Gives time to reinvest rewards without FOMO, upgrade efficiency or add more hashrate on the “cheap,” and just let compounding do its thing. If BTC shakes off the blahs and heads back up (plenty of people still betting on adoption/institutions pushing it), those accumulated sats will feel even sweeter.

No pressure, no hype—just sharing what works for me: low-stress mining exposure while I HODL and sip coffee. Crypto’s wild, but this setup makes the waits feel productive.

​I’m a student here and I'm terrible at saving. I’m constantly surrounded by people saying 'invest as soon as possible' and 'manage your money.'

​Reality: I never have the time, the skills, or enough cash to actually do it.
​So I’m building a simple app (EasyAu) to automate discipline.

​The concept: Turning spare change into 24k gold.
It rounds up every transaction (coffee, food) and automatically buys physical gold.

​Why: Because if I have $50 cash, I spend it on Uber Eats. If I have 0.5g of Gold, I keep it. It’s a psychological hack to build a stash I can't easily touch.

Ive slept 10 hours in 3 days no more than 3 hours at a time, had to get my car inspected, still have to get her car inspected, had to let electricians in and stay up while they installed her new car charger wiring then install the unit that she wasnt going to schedule or oversee. 

in her time home, while she is still breastfeeding no need to be unfair, thats a lot For her, she only did one load of dishes In 3 days. when I got my time I cleared the laundry, cleaned the downstairs completely, ran 3 loads of dishes, installed her ev charger in the wiring the electricians installed and finished fixing a cabinet  

this feels really inconsiderate. she comes in at 12:15 showered with coffee that is cold for me because she made it 2 hours earlier. I can’t get her car inspected now have to cancel and do it another day And asked that I not spend so much time home because her mom needs sleep too so I’m driving 30 minutes home, sleeping, eating, coming back for another overnight.

i just told her we need to talk when he’s home, which is something my therapist and I have been working on. i Just need to know if I’m being unreasonable that this doesn’t feel right

🍬 these come individually wrapped in sachets (personally didn't need that)

🗑️ some sachets were empty lol. and I accidentally gave an empty one to a friend visiting me after long as a present

🍼 it says one sachet is enough for 200 ml of milk. but that still tasted like milk & put me to sleep. i learned to use two

😯  Me, coffee & a self realisation journey 🧐

When I go out, mocha is one of my go-to things to get because I like sweet things and I like chocolate. 🩷 But I am always disappointed because mochas have kind of tasted like nothing to me, not even coffee. Something closer to milk. I don’t think it’s the coffee’s fault. I’ve had mochas at places I consider special - Blue Tokai, Ikviti and Colocal etc. At Colocal, I could literally see the chocolate sitting at the bottom of the cup, but I still couldn’t taste it in the coffee. 😔😶‍🌫️ That's when it settled that I have a calibration problem. 📐 

Initially, I had the same problem with this one. Tasted like milk. The package instructions were NOT doing it for me. Eventually, after some tweaking the recipe, I could finally taste the chocolatiness that I usually miss in other mochas. ☕ 

I think part of the reason is that I’m making it at home. At home, I can put as much sugar as I want. I don’t have judgy eyes watching me use sugar packets or telling me there’s already sugar in the coffee or giving me only one sachet of sugar. Because I could control the sweetness, I think I was actually able to taste the chocolatiness in this coffee. 🍫 That's my hypothesis. 🧪 

Would I repurchase it? Yeah, I’d consider it. It didn’t feel like it gave me the strongest caffeine kick, but that’s okay sonetimes. I drank this hot btw & I look forward to trying this cold 🌞 this summer. ",1,1771349951.0,coffeeindia,1,0.67,False

My ex boyfriend was spending a lot of time with me under the guise that the was “working on his feelings” for me and “trying to get to a place of better emotional availability” and repeatedly told me that he was not involved with, seeing or dating anyone else. He told me something about “us” being a slow burn type of situation. We were ritualistically spending one day a week together at the gym/coffee after, talking daily, and sometimes spending time out with friends other than that. There was intimacy, future talk, ect.

He knew I would stop it all if he was seeing other people. I told him that point blank. Our friends started to worry that he would treat me like his girlfriend in public.

I had caught wind of him “talking” to another woman as he was stupid enough to share this with my best friend. After some thought, I made the choice to end things with him and asked him to sort out what he actually wanted. I had no idea how bad things actually were. I told him he had no intentionality with me if he had involvement with other people.

Unfortunately, a few days after discussion about the “other woman”, someone posted him on one of those “are we dating the same guy” Facebook groups and everything immediately unraveled. I found out that he was actively seeing and having intimacy with multiple other women in this time period. I feel so incredibly betrayed because I acted in good faith— I trusted what he said was real and that I meant something with him. I am utterly disgusted that he was touching me and using me as a shoulder to cry on (literally calling me and crying) all while out with many other women.

Instead of taking any accountability for lying to me for months, he called the mutual friend who tipped me off about the first woman and blamed her for outing him to me. This friend had nothing to do with the Facebook post, it was coincidental and posted by another woman he had been seeing.

How does one recover from this kind of betrayal? I’m moving on in the healthiest way possible, but now I just feel like I’m on high alert for cheating/disingenuous behavior. It also makes me question a lot of things in our actual relationship beforehand— I attributed disappearing at night to avoidance and needing space, but now I question if there was cheating.  I ran in to one of his other ex’s at a local bar the other night and she told me some pretty weird information about him being out with another woman likely around the time we were together.

I’m also extremely angry that he did not disclose multiple sexual partners to me. I got tested, and than k god I am fine, but I just feel a bit jolted to my core.",1,1771349828.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

The liars are watching a movie at the cinema but Aria wonders if Jason hides Ian in his house. Cause Melissa goes to find him on foot. Well saying he's sober now doesn't mean he definitely has the brightest judgement. Spencer probably saw A in the back of the cinema. How are the the only ones there? And now the tape is burned or something? Oh it was Spencer's dream. That makes sense. Melissa searches for her ring. She got a call and goes upstairs, Spence eavesdrops her but I don't know what she understood.

Marin house. Ashley and Tom are laughing together. Tom offers to get Hanna to school but usually Mona gets her. He wants to play the good and present dad but he isn't good at it at all. He leaves and Han asks what they were laughing about. She said he reminded her when she made dinner for his mom, she rearranged the living room furniture. Han is right, why is Ashley so jolly about him? You should be more careful Ashley. No definitely, but we are hesitant. 

The liars meet at school's bathroom. Spence reads scout's letter and thinks it isn't that bad but it's a maybe letter and Emily's parents want something certain. Aria will go to Hollis college to unexpectedly see Ezra. She says she believes it's over between him and Jackie cause that's what he said.


Spence sees Toby at the school, he dropped paperwork for GED. He's starting to work to Jason's house. Spence tells him to not go and makes him promise he won't go inside.

Hanna sees Lucas. He will give Caleb a ride to hardware store cause he lives in his house for now. Han wants to do something with Lucas cause she's bored or something. He asks her why she doesn't hang around the girls. He guesses it is her parents' idea. He offers her to help with the yearbook. I like his shirt. I guess it means “I love applepie”.

Aria walks with Ezra. She would like to get her photo retaken cause she thinks it looks like a mugshot. They are so happy cause no one will see them there but like as I said people could unexpectedly show up there. They were holding hands and now they are kissing and Jackie sees them.
She goes in a pottery class, she sees Jenna there and got scared.

Spencer passes by Jason's house and sees someone inside. It's Toby I guess. Jason asks her if she looks for someone. She mentions Toby and he says he left about an hour ago. Okay so you see this makes it worse. 😂 He says he's the only one staying here. But you let a person going near the curtains?!

Spencer calls Emily cause she's freaked out. “Sometimes when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail” That's so cool!! Very good. “Why are you talking to me like Ben Franklin?” Epic!! Spence freaks out cause she's scared. Jason puts newspapers on the window. She remembers when once Ali's parents were out of town Jason was doing a party in the house, Ali knocked on Hastings house, where Emily and Spencer were hanging out. Ali said she couldn't sleep in there cause there aren't enough bedroom locks. I thought it would be because of the noice. She says he doesn't has friends but idiots he gets wasted with. She thinks she should call her grandma cause he's counting on her money but if she tell her about that, she will cut him out of her will. Ali gets emotional.
Pam asks Em if she has done with packing. Spence calls her again to tell her what she remembered. I love flashbacks cause we learn more stuff but this one's scary like she looks so scared.

Han asks Lucas how many photos can fit in a page. He tells her about Danielle. She tells him to make a move on her. 

Hastings house. Melissa stills searches for her ring. Spence tries to persuade her to sleep in the house instead of the barn. She tells her that she hopes she would protect her from someone who isn't herself. She tells her about someone that was bullying her in elementary school and one day she came home, with a red mark on her neck and was afraid to tell her mom about it. The next day Melissa threatened the bully. Melissa says she doesn't remember. I believe maybe she just denied cause she wants to protect Ian or something. But she should say she remembers. And then says her husband is missing and don't make her choose between them. 

Aria tells Ezra about Jenna he tells her to try to make up with her. Spence finds Melissa's wedding ring behind the toaster.

Marin house. Hanna hears Tom talking on the phone that “This isn't why I came here” and he says he has some differences with Isabelle about the wedding.
 
The liars minus Spence are in a car, Aria tells Hanna needs to let her parents work it out themselves. Em holds a letter, Aria reads it, it is a guaranteed letter for Danby. Em says she wrote it. Hanna's “You're totally getting me into Harvard” is so funny. “You are not lying, you're just pretelling the truth” Cool, but when it doesn't work out like that? Then what? 

Toby works on Jason's house. Jason tells him to take a break, he tells him he didn't believed he was guilty. Wrong place at the wrong time and he's been there. Spence came there. Jason thought she was Melissa, he said she goes there cause mailman keeps getting them his stuff. Spence tries to tell him to leave again. Toby says the truck is probably sold and this is the best job he can have at the time. Jason throws some stuff, there is blood in somewhere so Spence thinks it could be Ian's. Jason said he cutted himself. Jenna throwed something and Aria said she's named Anita. Yeah like she won't understand your voice?

At the yearbook thing. Han tries to make Danielle like Lucas by telling her she once liked him but couldn't compete with all the other girls.

Spence pawns Melissa's wedding ring. This is one of the stupidest things I think she has done. She says she will be back in two days but wants some money. 

Lucas asks Han what she told Danielle cause she wants to see more of his photos who thinks he sells online and wants to grab coffee. He asks her what's behind it cause last time she used him to break up with Sean. Actually A used him but he doesn't know that. And also says her mom's line about changing.

Em puts the letter inside the envelope. Pam comes with some stuff of Emily's childhood. Pam says it must have been hard hiding who she was and thinks she would love her less if she tells. Em rips the letter apart and throws it. I have told you that you should burn it and throw the ashes!

Spencer comes with a truck on Jason. He says I love you. She says she wants to say it first.

Marin house, Han sees her parents laughing at each other, she sees Isabelle's message that sees sorry and would marry him in a phone booth. She deletes it.

Pottery class. Jenna asks Anita, who is Aria to put a pot she made on a turntable against the wall and if she could clean up. Aria puts it and cleans up. She asks her to light it, which she does. It looks pretty good. Jenna said she used to swim and felt good and she wanted to give that vibe. Aria said it does. Jenna asks if it's Aria, she says yes. Jenna tells to blow of the candle, which she does.

Fields house. Pam says a letter came from Danby. It's the letter she wrote. She searches her garbages A wrote: “Your can't play cat and mouse if mouse moves to Texas. I need you here, Em. Congrats!” Told you. So A came again into your house.

Spencer hears something, I believe Melissa wants to check if Spence is asleep.

The liars minus Em meet. Aria says about Anita. Melissa is on the move. They follow her. She meets Wren who probably gives her painkillers. “Only Melissa would ask the guy she dumped to help the murderer she married” That's so funny and true!!!

1r7cqif,https://i.redd.it/rkb7ssoib3kg1.png,"I spent hundreds of hours building a privacy-first budgeting app: upload a CSV, auto-categorize in seconds, forecast your cash flow for the year","When I looked around for good budgeting apps, I kept seeing the same problems:

* They sell your data or market to you based on it
* They require sensitive bank connections
* They come with expensive subscriptions
* Or they focus on tracking the past instead of helping you plan the future

So I started building the tool I actually wanted.

That turned into Sunny Budget, a privacy-first budgeting and forecasting app.

Core experience:

* Export a CSV from your bank and upload it
* Transactions auto-categorize locally in seconds
* See your monthly net cash flow forecasted out for the year
* No bank connections, no ads, no data selling

Privacy isn’t a feature bolted on later. The system is built around a zero-knowledge architecture from the ground up.

Your **financial data is encrypted on your device before it’s ever sent to the server**. It lives in a private vault using AES-256, so on the server side it’s just an unreadable encrypted blob. There’s no admin interface or internal tooling that can expose user budgets or transactions, because the system never has access to the unencrypted data.

If you’re curious, **you can even verify this yourself in your browser’s developer tools** (I walk through the steps to do this right on the website).

This is completely self-funded and mission-driven. I believe financial clarity changes people’s lives, and tools like this shouldn’t depend on ads, data brokerage, or dark patterns to survive. So I’m building it the way I think it should exist.

I’ve put a few hundred hours into it so far. It’s still early (in beta), and I’d genuinely appreciate your feedback! Thanks!

1. The physical component and psyche in regards to emotional reactions.  The anicca, impermenance, equanimity and balance.  What balance and peace truly FEELS like in my body.  Yes, the most important lesson... Got it.
2. There is no such thing as ""I"" - Me, mine, etc.  I've KNOWN this truth in my heart for quite some time, on that intellectual level.  I listen to a lot of reggae and ""I and I"" in rasta culture is just that.  We are all one, ONE love, etc.   But I now have a deep understanding of the simple fact that we are all molecules, energy and elements constructed together.   The mental construct of possession and ""I"" sets me apart from everything rather than being ONE with everything and everyone.  We are all one being.  If I harm you, I am harming me.  I am harming us all, not even just you and me.  I can send love and positive energy outward.  Now, my prayers are not to some OTHER outside diety... but to ALL the collective energy that is GOD and us.
3.  I can experience emotion without having to bring anyone else into it.  I have been SO used to having a feeling and then sharing it, seeking validation when I'm angry or sympathy from others when I'm sad.  I don't need to affect anyone else when I'm having an emotional reaction, particularly a ""negative"" one.   I can just BE, and let it happen without trying to stop it or bring anyone else into it.   They may be able to sense it, but I don't need to amplify it.
4. I can definitely experience a transcendental experience without drugs.  I can be aware of physical sensations far beyond the ""regular"" experience of touch.  I'm 3 days home and can still feel the air on my skin, the hair on my head and water doing down into my stomach.  Food tastes delicious, my coffee is amazing.  All conversation with people is fantastic and I appreciate the energy exchange.   
5. I became aware yesterday that I have ignored some people on the fringes of my life.  People I come into contact with on a regular basis, but not really directly, for YEARS now, I barely know their name, never say ""hello"" etc.  -- I'm going to make an effort to pay more attention to others, even when I'm ""busy"" with ""my"" stuff.  I talked to two people yesterday that I see once or twice a week, sometimes more, for almost 9 years now.   One of them, I haven't every said ""hello"" to.  Ever.  Not once.  I ignored him once years ago when he was trying to say hi and he never tried again.  Neither did I.  Another guy, I had a 20 minute conversation with, which was the longest we had ever talked in the 9 years we have gone to the same AA club.  We even serve on the Board of Directors together, but have never really talked one on one.  Crazy.
6.  I want to practice more compassion.  I definitely judge and condemn often.
7. Vegetarian diet wasn't as bad as I thought.
8. I have a LOT of future conversations with people. 
9. That was a LOT harder than I thought it was going to be.  Respect to all others that have gone through that.   
10. I can now understand why monks do what they do.",1,1771349442.0,vipassana,2,1.0,False

This is just to give advice for the trickier achievements, or those that I think have a good trick, it will not include the ones that are more self explanatory (like Goodnight or Moon badge, where there is no special trick other than to play as well as you can)



Backpack Badge: See my earlier post on tips for every upgrade

Bunny, Pumpkin, and Coffee badges: Get as many money upgrades as you can, including balloon+, money bag, and especially reusable bag+. 

\- For the Pumpkin, try to avoid spending money, and save up for the pumpkins, since you need to buy 3 at once, but don't save it all: if you start getting low on hearts, buy apples, and the ruby staff is always worth it.

\- For Coffee and Bunny, buy the dark roast/gatcha capsule as soon as you can, unless you cannot deal with the speed for coffee, in which case save until you can get the remaining requirement of purchases all at once.

Swatted Badge: The Antique hourglass is very useful, as you would imagine, and using balloon can help time the fall to hit the fly. Otherwise, another easy way is if a fly randomly hits the ground in front of you, in which case you can walk onto it, to get the achievement. However, if you have the hourglass, then this cannot happen, so you have to choose which method you are going for

Ghost Badge: Choose a good item to start with, as you cannot get any later. I think apple seeds is not a bad one to get, but pocket cloud isn't bad too if you tend to take damage from falling a lot. Other items can be useful too, if you think they would prevent a lot of damage. Also, remember that you can get 1/4 hearts and full hearts in the sky, so try to get as much distance in the sky as you can to get these

Potassium: Try to just go around at 1 health in the wanderlust woods, and hit every banana you can see. If you have trouble, and are dying too much before hitting the banana, then use the wooden shield, as the most likely way of taking damage from a banana is from falling, so the shield will keep you safe while you try to die to the banana.

Porcelain Badge: Use wooden shield+ and pocket cloud, since using those don't contribute to the teapot breaking

Aurum Badge: Not much to say, but in the other post, they don't detail how many items you need to convert, it only says in the comments, so I will say here: You need to convert 5 items to gold, Gilda will mark this by saying ""That's a gold fever"" or ""Remember, gold isn't everything""",2,1771349320.0,ChikisChase,0,1.0,False

* 2 tbsp instant coffee
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp hot water
* 1 cup milk (hot or iced)
* Ice (optional)

# How to Make It

1. In a bowl, combine instant coffee, sugar, and hot water.
2. Whisk (by hand or with the [Zulay Kitchen milk frother](https://www.zulaykitchen.com/products/milk-boss-milk-frother-without-stand?variant=45472420987118?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=cast_iron_launch&utm_content=post_3-Ingredient_Easy_Whipped_Coffee)) until it turns thick, fluffy, and light brown. This usually takes 2–4 minutes.
3. Fill a glass with milk (and ice if you like it cold).
4. Spoon the whipped coffee on top.
5. Stir before drinking and enjoy.

That’s it. Creamy, sweet, and strong with barely any effort.

If you are not Orthodox, or this is your first one as Orthodox, you should be consulting with a priest before beginning any fast! If you are Orthodox, still speak with your priest! 😄😄

Do not boast about fasting. Ie, making a big show like “oh no I can’t eat that because I’m FASTING” 

Eat what is put in front of you. If your grandma makes you dinner and it contains dairy, say thank you, pray, and eat.

Do not spend $100 on lobster or other expensive “Lenten” food because it’s “allowed.” Simple Lenten meals, not luxury. This goes for coffee hour as well, keep it simple! That’s the point! Less focus & money on food, more on prayer, fasting, charity, etc. 

You are not a monk or a nun, so do not feel like you HAVE to carry out lent as according to monastic tradition. 

Do not harm yourself in an attempt of keeping the fast. If you have medical needs that require certain diets, keep that! 

Do your best 🩷 You might not be able to get off work for services. It might not work out that you can get off work and get the kids in time for weekday services, it is okay. 

Read and reread then read again, Romans 13:11-14; 14:1-4 & Matthew 6:14-21

Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈.

The magic in that one was bourbon vanilla, oak, and tuberose done in a dry, not-too-sweet way.

The closest vibe I’ve found is Maison Margiela Replica By the Fireplace. It leans smokier, but it hits that warm chestnut-vanilla comfort. If you want something smoother and more polished, Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium gives you sweetness and depth, though it’s heavier on coffee and sugar. For a softer, more affordable option, Mix:Bar Vanilla Bourbon actually does a solid job capturing that boozy vanilla feel without going cloying.

What made Nirvana Bourbon special was restraint. It wasn’t loud. So when you’re testing replacements, avoid anything too syrupy or overly floral. Look for notes like oak, sandalwood, vanilla absolute, or even a subtle tobacco accord. Skin chemistry matters here—on me, overly sweet vanillas turn into cupcakes fast, so I stick to drier blends.

If you layer, try a light vanilla base with a woody or smoky spray on top. It can recreate that depth surprisingly well.

If you’re hunting for an orthodontist (especially in South Florida/Miramar area), your brain is probably fried. You’re hearing a million different things from ads, friends, and different consults.

I’m going to cut through the noise. No generic fluff. Just the raw answers on money, pain, and what actually moves teeth.

Here is the truth about orthodontic treatment.

***

## 1. The Money: Does Insurance Actually Pay?

This is usually the first question. **Nobody wants a $5,000 surprise.**

Here is the math:
*   Most plans have a **lifetime max** of $1,000 to $3,000.
*   Some only cover kids (under 19). Some cover adults.
*   **The Kicker:** Insurance pays *over time*, not upfront.

Your orthodontist is essentially acting as a bank, waiting for those monthly checks from your insurance. This is why you almost always have to pay a down payment and monthly installments.

**The Bottom Line Cost:**
*   **Metal Braces:** $2,500 - $5,000 (after insurance).
*   **Invisalign:** $3,000 - $6,000 (Higher lab fees = higher cost).

**Pro Tip:** Look for places offering **$0 Down Financing**. We do this at SMILE-FX so you don't have to drain your savings just to start.

***

## 2. Braces vs. Invisalign: What actually works better?

I get asked this at every single consultation.

**The brutal truth:** They both work, but one requires *you* to do the work.

### Metal Braces
*   **Pros:** Total control. They work 24/7. They don't care if you're lazy. They handle complex rotations better.
*   **Cons:** Ugly, hard to clean, can't eat popcorn.
*   **Best For:** Complex cases and people who know they won't wear trays.

### Invisalign (Clear Aligners)
*   **Pros:** Invisible, removable, comfortable.
*   **Cons:** If you don't wear them 22 hours a day, **they do not work.**
*   **Best For:** Discipline kings/queens and mild-to-moderate aesthetic fixes.

An honest orthodontist won't push the one that makes them more money; they’ll push the one that fits your lifestyle.

***

## 3. The ""Forever"" Rule (Retainers)

I wish people understood this *before* they paid for braces.

**If you stop wearing your retainer, your teeth WILL shift.**

Not ""might."" **Will.**

Physics wins every time. The fibers in your gums remember where your teeth used to be, and they are constantly pulling them back.
*   **The Prescription:** Nightly wear. Forever.
*   **The Reality:** It’s a small price to pay to protect a $5,000 investment.

If you lost your retainer and your teeth shifted, call your ortho immediately. We can fix minor relapses quickly. Wait too long? You're paying for full braces again.

***

## 4. Ceramics vs. Metal: Is the ""Clear"" look worth the cash?

It comes down to **Vanity vs. Durability.**

**Ceramic (Clear) Braces:**
*   Cost $500–$1,000 more.
*   They are brittle (can chip).
*   They stain if you drink coffee/red wine and don't brush immediately.
*   *Verdict:* Good for adults in professional settings.

**Metal Braces:**
*   Cheaper.
*   Indestructible tanks.
*   *Verdict:* Better for kids and teens.

***

## 5. Technology: What actually matters?

Ignore the fancy lobby. Look for the tech that improves *precision*.

*   **3D Scanning:** If they are still using goopy impressions that make you gag? Run.
*   **Digital X-rays:** Less radiation, instant results.
*   **Robotic Wire Bending (SureSmile):** This creates custom wires. It’s not a gimmick; it’s precision engineering.

At [SMILE-FX](https://smile-fx.com/vip-tech/cutting-edge-technology/), we invest heavily here because it speeds up treatment times.

***

## 6. How to spot a bad Orthodontist

Marketing is easy. Results are hard. When you look at reviews, ignore the generic ""5 stars, great!"" posts.

**Look for patterns in the comments:**
*   Do they mention hidden fees?
*   Do patients feel ""rushed""?
*   Is the pricing transparent?

Also, **Location Matters.** You are going to visit this office every 6-8 weeks for two years. Do not pick a place an hour away to save $100. You will hate yourself by month 4.

***

## The Next Step

If you are in **Miramar, Pembroke Pines, Weston,** or anywhere in Broward County, stop guessing.

You need a board-certified specialist who handles complex cases and verifies your insurance *before* you commit.

A week later, Ashley and I were going out to a bar and then a club to go out with a group of her friends. While at the bar, Ashley states that since our conversation about exclusivity the week before she has had a change of heart and that  she wants me to still be exclusive with her but only by ""being the only person I'm talking to romantically or doing anything sexual with, but if \[she's\] out in the club \[she's\] allowed to have fun and make out with a stranger."" I explained to her that's not my definition of exclusive at all, but if that's what she wanted I'd try it for a bit, as long as she doesn't start hitting on or getting with other men in front of me. She agreed to that and we moved on with the rest of the night which was pretty fun.

That was until we got to the club and met up with her three friends. I was talking to one of them on a couch and when I look over at Ashley I see her making out with one of the friends right in front of me, literally a couple of hours after our conversation. I was pretty pissed off and she tried to explain to me that she had forgotten but I wasn't really in the mood to listen to what she had to say so went home.

The next day I was still pretty riled up so I didn't really talk to her apart from a few small texts. That night I ran into another girl I had been seeing prior to Ashley, and to shorten the story we ended up sleeping together.

The next day Ashley asked to meet and I agreed to go for coffee with her. She apologised and explained she really likes me but feels I want something too committed and that if I can't loosen up a bit she doesn't think it's going to work. I then told her what had happened the night before and her face dropped. She said that I had completely disrespected our relationship and broken her trust. I tried to explain that I thought our level of exclusivity had been scrapped after what she pulled in the club, and that the girl I had slept with and I both recognised it as a one night thing, and that I really wanted to be with her but was just confused by what she wanted.

Since then I have barely heard from her so I'm not really sure where her head is at, and I don't really know where mine is at either. AITAH here? I genuinely have no clue. ",1,1771348685.0,AITAH,25,0.53,False

I have social anxiety disorder and I find it very hard to even talk to strangers in public. I had only been going outside if I absolutely had to for years. I'm socially awkward but I have a good heart.

I don't really drink often, and I don't smoke or do drugs. I live in Parkdale, and I'm on ODSP, so I don't work. I love drinking coffee, all types of music, stand up comedy, nature and crime documentaries, comedy and thriller movies, board and card games, and recreational activities like darts, pingpong, pool etc

I started walking almost everyday for a couple months now. I want to work out as well. I would also like to try new things, find new hobbies, or stuff to do and I would really love people to do it with. 

DM me if you actually want to meet up.

Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

I took it every day from 1 to 2 PM. I'm one of those people who survives on coffee in the morning, so by lunchtime, I'm starving and can't function.  
I had this hour blocked off as 'busy' on my calendar, but my manager (newly promoted and full of himself) started scheduling meetings right in the middle of my lunch break.  
The first one or two times, I let it slide, assuming it was an emergency. But it became a regular occurrence. So, after about the third time, I politely reminded him that this was my lunch hour. His response? 'We all have to make sacrifices.'  
Alright then. Message received.  
For the very next meeting he scheduled, I joined with a large burrito bowl. I made sure my camera was on and my mic was unmuted. I was enthusiastically scraping the bowl and eating, giving a thumbs-up whenever anyone asked me a question.  
Two days later, he did it again. This time, I brought a large bowl of ramen. Last week, it was fish and chips, complete with the crinkly paper.  
He finally broke. He sent me a private message during the meeting: 'Do you have to eat during our meetings?'

1r7bvsk,https://i.redd.it/xot9yi0c63kg1.png,Claude Cowork: How I Use AI to Execute Real Work,"I’ve been testing Anthropic’s new desktop agent, Claude Cowork. It’s the first AI tool I’ve used that actually feels like delegating work instead of chatting with software.

A few weeks ago I gave Claude access to a test folder called CoworkDownloads (300+ random files, duplicate PDFs, screenshots, receipts, and “Image.png” chaos). I told it: organize this, rename everything clearly, flag duplicates, and create a structure that makes sense.

I left for coffee. Twelve minutes later, it was done.

Folders created. Files renamed. Duplicates separated. Summary of changes. No uploading, no dragging, no manual cleanup. I described the outcome and it executed.

That’s the shift.

# What Claude Cowork actually is

Most AI tools are conversation. You ask, they answer.

Cowork is delegation. You give Claude access to a folder, describe the result you want, approve the plan, and it does the work directly in your files.

Think of it like giving a capable assistant a project brief instead of asking them questions all day.

It runs in a secure sandbox and only touches folders you allow. For destructive actions it asks permission first. You can queue tasks and let it run while you do higher-value work.

Right now it requires Claude Max, about $100–$200/month depending on tier.

# Where this is immediately useful

I’ve been testing it across typical founder/operator tasks:

Research → deliverables Drop notes, PDFs, transcripts, or screenshots into a folder. Prompt: “Create a summary with key insights and recommendations.” Output: structured doc or deck in minutes.

Receipts → expense sheet Dump 40 receipt images. Prompt: “Extract date, vendor, amount, category. Flag unclear.” Output: clean spreadsheet with totals.

Messy docs → organized project folder Point at a chaotic directory. Prompt: “Create logical folders, rename files, add README.” Output: usable structure instantly.

Competitive scans Save competitor pricing pages and reviews. Prompt: “Compare pricing, features, positioning. Identify gaps.” Output: analysis table + insights.

These are all things that used to eat hours of low-value time.

# What this changes

The bottleneck moves.

Before: execution capacity. Now: deciding what’s worth doing.

If your work primarily involves formatting, organizing, compiling, or processing, tools like this will compress it significantly.

If your value is judgment, strategy, synthesis, and decisions, tools like this multiply you.

That’s the real opportunity.  


# Limits (for now)



It’s early. A few realities:  


* macOS only
* No cross-device sync 
* Experimental preview 
* Don’t use on critical data without backups 
* Not for regulated/compliance workloads 

Also: never give it your entire drive. Only project folders.

# How I’d start

If you want to test this safely  


1. Create a /cowork-workspace folder 

2. Copy non-critical files into it 

3. Try one task: organize, summarize, or extract 

4. Review outputs carefully 

5. Save prompts that work

Treat it like onboarding a new assistant. Start small, then expand.

# The bigger shift

There are two types of AI users emerging:

Chatters: ask questions, copy-paste answers 

Delegators: assign outcomes, review results  


*That’s the divide to watch.*

Cowork isn’t perfect, but it’s the clearest sign yet that AI is moving from “tool you use” to “work you assign.”

And once work becomes assignable, everything about productivity changes.",1,1771347885.0,u_HensonBuilds,0,1.0,False

1r7bqpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenOfPurpose/comments/1r7bqpz/how_to_become_a_better_husband_sciencebacked/,How to Become a Better Husband: Science-Backed Strategies That Actually Work.,"Ok so I spent like 6 months diving deep into relationship psychology because I noticed so many guys around me (including myself at times) were completely clueless about what actually makes a marriage work. Not the hallmark card BS or the ""happy wife happy life"" garbage everyone repeats. I'm talking about what researchers, therapists, and people in genuinely healthy 20+ year marriages actually do differently.

Here's what I found after going through stacks of relationship research, podcasts with actual couples therapists, and some brutally honest books: most marriage advice is either too vague or focuses on surface level stuff. The real game changers are way more specific and honestly kind of counterintuitive.

**Stop trying to fix everything she tells you**

This one hit me hard. When your partner vents about work drama or friend issues, your instinct is probably to jump in with solutions. That's not what she needs like 90% of the time. Research from relationship expert John Gottman shows that emotional validation matters way more than problem solving in these moments. Just listen, acknowledge how she feels, and ask ""do you want my thoughts or just want me to listen?"" before offering advice. Sounds simple but it's legitimately difficult to suppress that fix it reflex.

**Learn her specific stress signals**

Everyone has tells when they're overwhelmed or anxious. Maybe she gets quiet, maybe she cleans aggressively, maybe she scrolls her phone more. Whatever it is, notice the pattern and respond before she has to explicitly ask for support. This isn't mind reading, it's just paying attention. The book ""Hold Me Tight"" by Dr Sue Johnson (she's literally THE expert in emotionally focused therapy and has studied thousands of couples) breaks down how to recognize these attachment signals. Insanely good read that'll make you question everything you thought you knew about why couples fight.

**Do the mental labor without being asked**

This is the difference between helping out and actually being an equal partner. Don't just do chores when asked, track what needs doing yourself. Remember the kids dentist appointments, notice when you're low on groceries, plan date nights without her having to coordinate everything. There's solid research showing that unequal emotional labor is one of the biggest sources of resentment in modern marriages. The invisible workload destroys relationships slowly.

Check the app Fair Play if you want to split household stuff more equitably. It gamifies domestic responsibilities and helps couples actually see who's doing what. Makes those ""but I help out all the time"" arguments way less common because you can see the data.

**Fight better, not less**

Healthy couples still argue, they just do it differently. They take breaks when things get too heated, they don't bring up past shit to win points, and they repair quickly after. Gottman's research found that couples who last aren't the ones who never fight, they're the ones who know how to de escalate and reconnect. Learning to say ""I'm getting flooded, can we pause this for 20 minutes"" is legitimately more valuable than trying to never disagree.

The Gottman Institute has a card deck app with conversation starters and repair questions. Sounds cheesy but it gives you actual tools for tough conversations instead of just winging it and saying something you'll regret.

**Prioritize her friendships and alone time**

Don't be that guy who gets weird when she wants girls night or needs space. A partner who has a full life outside the marriage is a happier partner. Plus it takes pressure off you to be her entire social world, which is exhausting for everyone. The book ""Mating in Captivity"" by Esther Perel explores how maintaining some separateness actually increases desire and connection. She's a world renowned therapist who's studied what keeps long term relationships passionate, and spoiler alert, it's not spending every waking moment together.

If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology but don't have the energy to read through all these books and research, there's this app called BeFreed that pulls from relationship books, therapy research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content based on your specific situation. You could type in something like ""I'm struggling with emotional availability in my marriage"" and it'll build an adaptive learning plan pulling from sources like Gottman, Perel, and other relationship experts.

What's useful is you can customize the depth, from a quick 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples and context. The voice options are surprisingly good too, way better than typical audiobook narration. Makes it easier to actually absorb this stuff during your commute instead of just bookmarking articles you'll never read.

**Show up for the boring stuff**

Grand gestures are cool but consistency with small things matters more. Asking about that meeting she was stressed about, remembering she likes her coffee a specific way, texting her something funny during the day. These micro moments of connection compound over time. Research on relationship satisfaction consistently shows that daily small positive interactions predict long term happiness better than occasional big romantic events.

**Own your own emotional regulation**

Don't make her responsible for managing your moods or walking on eggshells around your stress. Get a therapist if you need one, develop healthy outlets, and don't use her as your emotional punching bag after a bad day. The podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" by Esther Perel gives real therapy session recordings (anonymous obviously) and you hear how often guys externalize their emotional chaos onto their partners without realizing it.

Look, becoming a genuinely better partner isn't about perfection or never screwing up. It's about consistent effort, self awareness, and actually implementing what you learn instead of just nodding along and changing nothing. These aren't revolutionary concepts but most guys never actually do them because it requires ongoing work. Your marriage is either growing or dying, there's no neutral.",2,1771347607.0,MenOfPurpose,0,1.0,False
1r7bq46,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1r7bq46/the_psychology_of_attraction_do_you_actually_like/,The Psychology of Attraction: Do You Actually Like Them? (Even If You Don't Think So),"I spent months convincing myself I wasn't into someone. Then one random Tuesday at 2am, I caught myself smiling at their text like an idiot. That's when it hit me: I'd been lying to myself the entire time.



This happens way more than we think. I've been diving deep into attachment research, psychology podcasts, and honestly, just watching my friends be absolute disasters in the dating world. What I found? Most of us are walking around with zero clue about our actual feelings. We're either in denial, scared, or just emotionally constipated from years of protecting ourselves.



Here's what helped me figure out if I actually liked someone (spoiler: the signs were SCREAMING at me):



\*\*Your body knows before your brain does\*\*



\* You get weirdly nervous before seeing them. Like, checking your reflection multiple times nervous.

\* Their name pops up on your phone and there's this tiny adrenaline spike. Not huge, just... something.

\* You find yourself fixing your hair or adjusting your clothes when they're around. Subconscious peacocking is real.



This isn't just rom-com BS. In \*Attached\* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller (both Columbia psychiatrists, and this book is basically the bible for understanding why we're all so weird about relationships), they explain how our nervous system reacts to people we're drawn to before our conscious mind catches up. Your body is literally giving you spoilers about your feelings. The book breaks down attachment styles in a way that'll make you go ""OH THAT'S WHY I'M LIKE THIS."" Genuinely one of those reads that makes you want to text your ex and apologize, then immediately block them again.



\*\*You're curating your personality around them\*\*



\* You suddenly care about topics you never gave a damn about before because THEY care about them.

\* You're filtering what you say, trying to be the ""cool"" version of yourself. Exhausting but you keep doing it.

\* You notice yourself telling stories differently, funnier, more interesting when they're in the room.



Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett talks about this in her emotion research. We construct feelings through our behaviors and social cues, not the other way around. If you're performing for someone, that's your brain screaming ""PAY ATTENTION TO THIS PERSON.""



The podcast \*Where Should We Begin\* with Esther Perel has this episode where a guy insists he's ""just friends"" with someone while literally describing every micro-behavior that screams attraction. Perel (legendary couples therapist) basically calls him out in the gentlest but most devastating way possible. Worth a listen if you're currently lying to yourself.



\*\*You're doing mental gymnastics to justify seeing them\*\*



\* ""I'm just going to this party because Sarah will be there"" but really it's because THEY might show up.

\* You volunteer for random stuff you'd normally avoid. Group projects? Suddenly yes.

\* You have elaborate explanations for why you texted them at midnight about something that could've waited.



I started using this app called \*\*Finch\*\* to track my daily moods and it was wild seeing the pattern. Every day I saw this person, my mood rating was higher. The app is basically a self care pet game that helps you build awareness about what actually affects your emotional state. Sounds dorky but it made the pattern OBVIOUS.



If books like \*Attached\* clicked for you, there's this AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls from all these psychology sources, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it lets you customize the depth and length of what you're learning. You can do a quick 10-minute summary on attachment styles or go deep into a 40-minute dive with real examples and context. 



What's cool is you can type in something specific like ""understanding my attachment patterns in dating"" and it'll generate a podcast tailored to exactly that, pulling from books, studies, and expert interviews. There's also this virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your specific situation, which honestly sounds less cringe than it is. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic one that makes learning about emotional vulnerability way less painful.



\*\*The ""would I care if they dated someone else"" test\*\*



This one's brutal but effective. Imagine them posting a photo with someone new, all couple-y. If your stomach drops even a little? Yeah. You like them.



Most people fail this test spectacularly. We'll be like ""no I'm totally fine with them dating other people"" and then spiral for three days when we see them with someone at a party.



\*\*You remember weird details about them\*\*



\* Their coffee order, their sister's name, that story about their childhood dog.

\* You know their schedule without trying. Just casually aware they have that meeting on Thursdays.

\* Random things remind you of them constantly. A song, a meme, a specific type of weather.



In \*The Science of Likability\* (author Patrick King breaks down social psychology research in actually readable language), he explains that we subconsciously prioritize information about people we're attracted to. Your brain is literally filing away everything about them like you're building a dossier. 



\*\*Here's the thing nobody tells you:\*\* denying your feelings doesn't make them go away. It just makes you weird and confusing to be around. I spent so long pretending I wasn't into someone that I accidentally friend-zoned myself into oblivion.



Look, our brains are messy. We've been conditioned to protect ourselves, to play it cool, to not seem desperate or clingy. Society throws all this garbage at us about playing hard to get and not catching feelings too fast. Then we end up emotionally constipated, unable to recognize basic attraction because we're so busy performing indifference.



The good news? Once you start paying attention to these patterns, it gets easier to be honest with yourself. You don't have to DO anything about it right away. Just acknowledge it. Sit with it. Stop gaslighting yourself about your own feelings.



Your feelings are information, not instructions. You can like someone and still choose not to pursue it. You can be attracted to someone and recognize it's not the right timing. But at least you're being real with yourself instead of doing this exhausting performance of indifference while your body is literally screaming the truth.

# User Experience

I found the SmartCharge Pro very easy to use right out of the box. Plugging in devices is simple whether I use the built in USB C cable or one of the available ports. The integrated cable is long enough for me to comfortably use my device while it is charging, and it snaps neatly into the side of the power bank when I am done. The magnetic wireless charging pad holds my iPhone securely in place thanks to MagSafe compatibility, so I do not have to adjust it repeatedly to maintain a charge. The ports are spaced well enough that I can power multiple devices at the same time without crowding, and pass through charging works smoothly so I can recharge the battery while it charges other devices. The only drawback I noticed is when the unit is plugged directly into a wall outlet. Because of its size and weight, it can feel slightly off balance and is easier to knock loose than a smaller wall charger.

In terms of portability, I can carry it in my laptop bag without any issue, but I would not put it in a pocket. It may also feel a bit large for a smaller purse. The larger size comes with the benefit of a 15,000 mAh capacity, which is helpful for longer days away from an outlet. I prefer transporting it in a backpack or carry on rather than carrying it loose. The travel adapters are one of my favorite features. They slide directly over the built in US plug, so I do not need to pack separate converters. This simplifies packing and keeps everything contained in one device. I have the orange version, which is bright and easy to spot in my bag. The finish feels smooth without being slippery, and it does not attract fingerprints easily.

https://preview.redd.it/5aczvu0m53kg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07d38d91423d5dc376b474396fca7329deb3259c

Charging performance has been consistent across the board, and I ran several tests to see how it performs in real world conditions. When charging my iPhone 16 Pro magnetically, the battery increased from 13 percent to 54 percent in 41 minutes, a 41 percent gain that averages out to about 1 percent per minute. Over USB C, the phone went from 54 percent to 75 percent in 20 minutes, gaining 21 percent at roughly 1.05 percent per minute. Wired charging was slightly faster than magnetic charging, which is what I expected given the higher maximum output over USB C compared to the 15 W Qi2 magnetic pad. Even though the phone does not constantly draw the maximum rated wattage, the results are consistent with normal fast charging behavior.

For my Apple Watch Series 8, the battery increased from 62 percent to 65 percent in 10 minutes, a 3 percent gain that works out to about 0.3 percent per minute. The dedicated watch coil is rated at 5 W, so the slower rate is expected, especially with the watch already above 50 percent. I did have to remove one side of my Sport Loop band because the continuous loop design would not let the watch lie flat on the charger. Once I adjusted it, charging started immediately and remained steady. One limitation is that I cannot charge both my iPhone and Apple Watch wirelessly at the same time, so one of them needs to use a wired connection if both need power.

https://preview.redd.it/444b1jym53kg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=322d1a6e9f26ee24e61bd2e4b3dd2c682fb04edd

I also measured how the power bank itself charges and discharges. When recharging the SmartCharge Pro from 29 percent to 100 percent, it gained 71 percent over 226 minutes, averaging about 0.31 percent per minute. That is reasonable for a 15,000 mAh battery, especially since charging speeds naturally slow as the battery approaches full capacity. In a discharge test, the power bank dropped from 100 percent to 62 percent over 71 minutes while actively charging devices, a 38 percent decrease at roughly 0.54 percent per minute. That discharge rate supports the claim that the 15,000 mAh capacity can deliver multiple full smartphone charges before needing to be topped off.

https://preview.redd.it/o77z4yqn53kg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91239c387619dff1ed3d32c75f45ddf6c747202d

Based on my testing, the real world results align well with the published specifications. USB C charging is slightly faster than magnetic wireless charging, which matches the higher rated wired output. Magnetic performance falls in line with 15 W Qi2 expectations, and Apple Watch charging reflects the lower 5 W output of the dedicated coil. The recharge time of the battery and its discharge behavior are consistent with a 15,000 mAh pack that supports up to 45 W input. I did not experience any significant heat buildup during use. The unit became slightly warm while charging, but it never felt hot or concerning. Overall, I find it well suited for travel, work, and daily charging. It fits easily into luggage or a carry on and gives me a dependable all in one option when I am away from my desk.

I’m a 27F FiveM roleplayer looking for a long-term home server. I’m not looking for a city where you log in and see empty streets — I want a server that actually feels alive. Busy businesses, police activity, EMS running calls, random interactions, and people you consistently see.

So first: I’m searching for a high population, active server (US time zones preferably).

But I’m also looking for people inside it to actually build storylines with.

⸻

RP Partner (Long-Term Storyline)

I want a real character-based story, not instant relationship RP and not just logging in to grind robberies.

Slow burn arc:

meet randomly → keep running into each other → partners in trouble → trust → loyalty → ride or die.

My character is girly and social but makes very bad decisions and gets into situations she can’t handle 😭

I want someone whose character doesn’t just disappear when things go bad.

Looking for someone who:

• stays in character

• consistent activity

• values story over “winning”

• protective personality (criminal, MC, gang, or morally grey cop)

I like drama RP, emotional scenes, arguments, chaos, and character growth.

I’m okay with OOC friendship and if we genuinely click I’m not against it becoming more over time, but 27+ and USA only please — I’m not here to make things weird or cross boundaries.

⸻

Chaos & Reputation Goals

I want us to actually become known in the city.

• police recognize our car

• EMS knows us by name

• businesses gossip about us

• other criminals either trust us or avoid us

We’ll probably:

• get into robberies that go wrong

• run from cops together

• refuse to leave each other behind

• accidentally start drama everywhere we go

Basically I want people saying:

“oh no… those two are here again.”

⸻

Girl Besties

Also really important to me — I want female friends too.

I want:

• shopping RP

• coffee runs

• girls nights / clubs

• gossip and hangouts

• helping each other with outfits and characters

• just normal slice-of-life RP when crime isn’t happening

I don’t just want a partner storyline — I want a friend group inside the server.

⸻

What I’m Not Looking For

• empty or low population servers

• people who log in once a week

• instant marriage RP

• toxic OOC behavior

I’m active evenings & late nights CST and I stay consistent once I’m invested in a story.

If you have a server suggestion OR a character that fits this type of storyline, message me and tell me about your character and playstyle.

I’m not trying to win RP — I just want a living city and people who want to build something ongoing.

⸻

Ending line

I want the kind of RP where if one of us disappears for a few days, people in the city actually notice.",3,1771347525.0,GTARP,0,0.72,False

One moment, I was reading a sweet text from my husband, Damian Blake—""How's my girl today?""


The next, his ""fiancée"" just walked into my law office.


She was all breathy excitement, playing coy:


""I want to hire you for my fiancé's divorce. He claims his wife's a real classy bitch, so we gotta leave her some face.""


I glanced down at the intake form.


Client name: Damian Blake.


Clipped to the paperwork was a photo—same face I've woken up next to for nine years.


Except right now? He felt like a complete stranger


God, how ironic.


Five years as a divorce lawyer. Blown up more marriages than I can count.


Today, it was finally my turn.


Congratulations, Damian.


You just handed your mistress the one lawyer in New York who's going to make damn sure you regret it.


...


I closed the file and looked up at the woman sitting across from me.


She wasn't stunning—pretty, maybe. Petite frame, that kind of skinny you only got when you'd never carried a child.


Well-spoken, clearly raised right.


But there was a naive purity that hinted at her sheltered life.


When she mentioned her upcoming ""promotion,"" there's smug satisfaction in her eyes—mixed with just a hint of nerves.


""Ms. Monroe, so... what do you think we should do?""


""My fiancé wants his wife to step aside quietly. You know, for old times' sake. He doesn’t want drama.""


She said it softly, a shy little smile playing on her lips.


If I wasn't sure she had no clue who I am, I'd have sworn she was taunting me.


I curved my lips into my best professional smile.


""Ms. Rhodes, how long have you two been together?""


She blinked, caught off guard.


""Sorry?""


I slowed down, enunciating each word clearly.


""Before I can give you legal advice, I need to know every detail about your relationship.""


""Oh! Right."" She nodded, her voice going all soft and dreamy.


But with every word she said, my smile got colder.


""We've been together for two years. Met at a charity gala.""


""Someone in his family had just been diagnosed with something serious. He was devastated. Alone on the terrace. I happened to walk by, and we just... talked for a while...""


A faint blush crept across her cheeks.


""We clicked right away. Less than a month later, we were official.""


Listening to her sweet little love story, my chest tightened like a fist is squeezing my heart.


""You met him two years ago today?""


""Wait—how did you know that?"" Her eyes went wide with surprise.


I let a small smile tug at my lips, my lashes hiding the ice in my gaze.


Of course I knew.


Because two years ago today, my father had a massive heart attack. He died in the ER at New York-Presbyterian.


Around the time they were ""meeting,"" I was on my knees outside the emergency room.


Falling apart. Screaming until my voice gave out.


The old wound ripped open fresh, slicing through me over and over.


I took a silent breath and moved on to my next question.


""You know he has a four-year-old son? He just started preschool.""


""Oh yeah,"" that timid look vanished instantly, replaced with total confidence.


""He promised once we're married, I'll be Noah's mom. Kids don't remember anything anyway. Whoever loves them is their real parent.""


She looked at me, seeking validation.


""Don't you think so, Ms. Monroe?""


My knuckles went white. My face stayed calm.


""Sure. You're absolutely right.""


Too bad you'll never get the chance.


She relaxed completely now, her guard down. She kept talking.


Her tone actually got a little cheerful:


""He even showed me pictures of his wife. She's got this C-section scar on her stomach—super deep and ugly.""


""He said it grossed him out every time he saw it.""


She let out a light laugh.


""Ms. Monroe, don't you think that woman's pathetic? Like, why would she hold on this tight? God, how desperate can you be?""


I laughed too. My eyes were frozen solid.


""Ever consider the possibility that his wife has NO IDEA your affair?""


Chapter 2


""No way!""


Tiffany's voice was razor-sharp, absolute.


""Damian can’t even stand to touch her. You'd have to be brain-dead not to notice. With me? He's all fire and hunger. But at home with that plain Jane? Says he's suffocating.""


""Ms. Monroe, seriously—if you went two years without sex, wouldn't you find that weird?""


""I would.""


My answer came fast, but my eyes were locked on the Cartier wedding band on my ring finger.


Damian and I came from completely different worlds.


But we went from high school sweethearts to husband and wife. Nine years total.


When I got pneumonia, he drove through a blizzard—three hundred miles—middle of the night. Just to bring me medicine.


When I was upset, he'd scour the whole Manhattan for that one bakery I loved.


When I was pregnant, when I gave birth—he never missed a single prenatal check-up.


Every time he came home, he'd hug me and Noah first, telling us we were the best part of his life.


Even when we stopped sharing a bed two years ago, he'd explained it so gently.


""Babe, having Noah wrecked your body. I can't let you go through that again.""


I thought that after the passion faded, this was what marriage became—gentle, steady affection.


Never occurred to me he was just getting his satisfaction elsewhere.


Ice crawled through my veins, straight into my chest. I pushed out my last question.


""So you just want HER to file for divorce? That's it?""


""No,"" she shook her head hard.


""The most important thing is—his wife can’t find out he cheated. Yeah, she helped Damian rise, but his success was ALL his own now. If she finds out, she'll destroy him!""


""Ms. Monroe, you're the best divorce attorney in New York. Our future's in your hands.""


I smiled and nodded.


""Don't worry.""


The second she left, I called my partner Logan Reid.


""Logan. I need our top PI and forensic accountant. Now! I want every financial transaction and travel record Damian's made in the last two years.""


""And tell my uncle—that fund Damian runs? Time to pull our family's investment out.""


""I want to see if he can stay afloat without me.""


Logan was my golden partner for a reason—his efficiency was unmatched.


Within hours, an encrypted 256GB hard drive sat on my desk.


""Everything you asked for. It's all in there.""


I plugged it in. Clicked open.


First video: on a private yacht.


Damian in a white linen shirt, looking gentleman as he clasped a Graff diamond necklace around Tiffany's neck.


Last month on my birthday, Damian said he had an emergency meeting at work. When he got home, all he brought was a wilted carnation he'd bought off the street.


Second video: department store security cam.


Damian had his arm around Tiffany's waist as they browsed through luxury boutiques.


Clothes, handbags, shoes—shopping bags piled up at Tiffany's feet like a small mountain. The intimacy between them practically leaked through the screen.


At checkout, the associate threw in a music box—free gift. He ended up giving it to Noah and told him 'Daddy picked it out special'.


I closed the file without expression and opened the next folder.


Damian's offshore account showed multiple large transfers labeled as ""investment consulting fees""—all ending up in an account ending in 3308.


Account holder: Tiffany Rhodes.


Such a sloppy attempt at asset concealment. Did he really think I'd never find out?


The last file made my fingertips go ice-cold.


Chat logs from Noah's preschool teacher.


Tiffany had been posing as ""Noah's aunt,"" constantly asking about his daily routine. She'd even already RSVP'd to next week's parent day!


My hand clenched around the mouse.


I couldn't accept it. Damian's betrayal had already crept into our son's life.


When Noah was born, Damian had held that tiny life in his clumsy arms and promised he'd cherish him forever.


Even just now, when Tiffany said she wanted custody, I'd held onto a sliver of hope.


At least Damian loved our son.


Even if we divorced, at least he wouldn't hurt him.


I was wrong.


Chapter 3


A gaping hole tore open in my chest, icy wind howling through.


I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed my phone, ready to warn him to stay the FUCK away from my son.


But my phone buzzed first—a message from Tiffany.


She'd sent a photo of herself, asking for my opinion.


""Ms. Monroe, does this outfit work? Damian's taking me and Noah to meet his parents tonight. I'm so nervous.""


Almost immediately, Damian's message came through:


""Babe, Mom and Dad are missing Noah. I'm taking him to the estate tonight. You've been working so hard—I booked you a spa appointment at the Equinox Hotels. Go relax.""


Looking at my son's innocent face in the photo, I smiled softly.


A spa? Not nearly as entertaining as this little family dinner show.


If they were meeting the parents, naturally the REAL wife should be there to supervise.


I hung up and immediately drove straight to the Blake estate.


On the way, Damian's messages kept popping up.


""Babe, you there yet? Traffic's bad on the main road—everything okay?""


He was tracking my location.


Calmly, I found a random spa photo online and sent it.


""Just got here. Nice place.""


Short reply. But he seemed satisfied.


""Have fun. Love you.""


Same old sweetness. Now it just made me sick.


I pocketed my phone and ignored the rest.


I parked the car and slipped in through the side entrance, sunglasses on.


Dinner hadn't started yet, but most of the Blake relatives had already arrived.


Damian's mother Helena was bustling between the kitchen and living room, all smiles—


The same warm, attentive energy she'd shown me years ago.


When I was exhausted, she'd bring soup to my office every week.


When I was cold, she'd knit me scarves and slippers, treating me better than her own son.


She even remembered my father's back problems and went out of her way to find an acupuncturist to help him.


My father—who could read anyone—had told me:


""The Blakes are good people. Marrying into that family, I've got no worries.""


Now, she was the first to greet Tiffany as she walked in beside Damian.


""You must be Tiffany! So pretty—I can tell you'll give us lots of grandsons.""


""Damian, don't you dare mistreat this girl.""


Damian's dad Thomas, usually so reserved, set down his coffee and patted Damian's shoulder with satisfaction.


""Smart choice, son. About time we had more boys in this family.""


Suddenly, it clicked—they were mad I only gave them ONE.


Funny—since Damian was the one who said no to more kids.


Tiffany straightened proudly, her voice dripping with sweetness:


""Don't worry, Uncle Thomas, Aunt Helena. Damian took me to get checked. The doctor said I'm very likely to have boys.""


""Wonderful! Just wonderful!"" His parents beamed while my son stood alone in the corner, forgotten.


Relatives crowded around, showering her with praise.


The cousin I loaned $150K? ""Damian, you absolute legend!""


The aunt whose kid I got into a study abroad program? Sobbing. ""Tiffany's such a sweetheart!""


The cousin whose startup I saved with my connections? Raising his glass. ""To the happy couple!""


Every single one of them had benefited from my help. Not one of them remembered my name now.


The aunt wiped her tears, then excitedly grabbed my four-year-old son and shoved him toward Tiffany.


""Go on, call her Mommy!""


Helena immediately chimed in, forcing Noah's hand into Tiffany's.


""Be a good boy, Noah. Say Mommy!""


My son stumbled backward, terrified.


""No! She's not my mommy! My mommy's name is Selena!""


Helena's face twisted instantly. She pinched his arm hard.


""Don't talk nonsense! This IS your new mommy!""


Thomas glared coldly.


""Damian, is this how you're raising your son? No manners at all!""


Tiffany nestled into Damian's arms, pouting.


""Damian... does Noah hate me?""


Damian held her close, his voice soft and soothing.


""Of course not. He's just a kid—he doesn't know any better. Once we're married, you'll handle all his discipline. I won't interfere.""


I stood outside the door, watching this absurd scene unfold, and finally—I couldn't take it anymore.


Then I pushed the door open.


Every face in the room froze in shock as I smiled lightly.


""Family dinner, huh? Weird—how come nobody told me?""

It has helped so much in planning our upcoming Aug 2026 adventure.

  
I'd like to get thoughts / experiences from people who have rented campervans and landed very early at KEF.  Our flight scheduled to land 6:20a and our campervan rental company opens at 9:00a with shuttle service starting at 8:50a.  We're eager to get rolling and considering a self-service pickup via taking a taxi from the airport \~5 km to the campervan pickup VS grabbing a coffee and just waiting for the shuttle.  I'm wondering 1) How much time would we actually be ""saving"" by self-serve... what the average time to deplane / customs & immigration / baggage pickup / taxi stand 2) What should we expect for cost of taxi? 3) Is there an advantage to rental-assisted pickup vs. self service... like do they do a walk-through of your rental that makes life easier in the long run? or any other perks?

Buckle up, because my journey from a backyard coffee enthusiast to a full-blown cafe owner was a rollercoaster, and honestly, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It all started with my obsession with coffee – not just drinking it, but understanding every single bean, roast, and brewing method. My tiny apartment kitchen became a mad scientist's lab, filled with exotic beans, grinders humming at all hours, and the air thick with the aroma of freshly roasted coffee. My friends and family were my willing (and sometimes unwilling) guinea pigs, taste-testing endless experimental brews.

There was a moment, though, a real 'aha!' flash, when my friend Sarah, after sipping one of my new cold brews, just looked at me with wide eyes and said, 'Dude, this is better than anything downtown. You HAVE to sell this!' That comment, simple as it was, sparked something. The fear was real, a cold knot in my stomach every time I thought about quitting my stable desk job. But the passion for crafting the perfect cup, and the dream of creating a space where people could connect over amazing coffee, was stronger. I spent months saving every penny, sketching out business plans late into the night, and learning everything I could about permits, suppliers, and espresso machines. It felt like I was constantly on the edge of a cliff, about to take a giant leap.

The day I finally signed the lease for a small, slightly rundown storefront, my hands were shaking. The place smelled faintly of stale cigarettes and forgotten dreams, but in my head, I could already see it: warm lighting, the clatter of mugs, the rich, comforting scent of roasting coffee beans. The renovation was a beast – endless painting, plumbing issues, and late nights with sore muscles. There were moments of utter despair when I thought I’d bitten off more than I could chew, lying awake staring at the ceiling, wondering if I'd made the biggest mistake of my life. But then I'd remember the joy of a perfectly pulled shot, or a customer's delighted smile, and it would fuel me to keep pushing.

Opening day was a blur of nervous excitement. I remember the first customer, an older gentleman, taking a sip of his latte and letting out a satisfied sigh. That sigh, that genuine appreciation, was everything. Slowly but surely, 'The Daily Grind' started finding its rhythm. We've had our share of spilled milk, broken machines, and early morning rushes that felt like controlled chaos, but through it all, the community we've built around coffee has been incredible. It’s not just a business; it’s a living, breathing part of the neighborhood.

Looking back, it’s wild to think about how far a crazy idea and a lot of caffeine can take you. It’s taught me resilience, the power of a good dream, and the importance of a strong brew to get you through the tough days. So, if you've ever dreamt of starting something, anything, what's holding you back? And for those who've taken the plunge, what's been your most unexpected challenge or biggest triumph?",1,1771347461.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

So thankful for this group to give me such a valuable perspective into the whole process. Looking for some advice re: the onboarding process/training process. Our Nanny has worked with two other families but each for only 6 months each. 

What did your first few days of work look like - did you follow the parent along and see how they play/comfort/put baby down for naps etc.... or was it more of an observed shift where the parent watched you? Of course, I'm going to show her where things are located and a couple of tricks with my son but I just don't want her to feel like I'm crowding her or always looking over her shoulder. We are planning on asking her to do more focus on childcare at first and then ramp up more of the house manager duties once she is comfortable with our son. We went over all of the housekeeping/cleaning duties in our contract so its been spelled out to avoid confusion. Planning on having some easy snacks and full access to coffee/tea for her too. 

I really like the Nanny and am hoping to make her feel comfortable so she loves her job. Any tips for a first time employer are appreciated. TIA",2,1771347372.0,Nanny,8,1.0,False

I work in a low volume store. it's mostly low volume because 1. there's a bigger store less than 5 miles away and 2. it's in between a McDonald's, wendys, subway and Chinese restaurant and there's a coffee shop being set up to open in the same building as us (this is gonna be important later). just adding some context.

so boom. about 2 months ago the metal part of the pizza peel separated from the wood handle, so now it wobbles when there's a pizza on it. as soon as I noticed, I let my GM know. he said he'd let the DO know and get a new one. again, that was 2 months ago. I still don't have a new peel. I asked my GM about it last week and he said ""she said she'd see about getting a new one"". and to me, that feels so dismissive. I'm not asking for a kidney. just a tool that I NEED to perform my job. I dropped a pizza once because of it and my GM tried to blame me. I literally wobbled the peel in his face cuz I TOLD YOU I NEED A NEW ONE MF.

next issue... the coffee shop. the owner of the coffee shop put in a water heater. that water heater is blocking our water meter. our hot water shut off for some reason and now, because of the new water heater, we can't access the monitor to diagnose the issue. we have been boiling water with a tea kettle to wash dishes for almost 2 weeks now. every time I ask about it they're ""trying to reach the landlord"". I just feel like no one is taking this seriously and the extra work is falling on me as in insider cuz I have to close. I have to do those dishes.

Currently im using a medium-light roast at 18g in 35.8g out in 35 seconds. The shots taste a bit sour to me at least but when I go slightly courser the shots flow quite quickly.

I have adjusted the internal burr down to give me more fine grounds as at first I was stuck on the lowest setting while grinding any beans. If I grind any finer the shot takes upwards of 50 seconds to pull so I dont think thats the issue. I have seen some conversation here about also using the amount of coffee in to adjust flavor slightly, is this a viable option or is 35 seconds just to long?

The coffee i get is pretty good once it has milk but i want to be able to taste the regular espresso without milk or enjoy a cortado without the intense bitter flavor. Any advice is welcome! 😀 ",1,1771347236.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

Monday morning had come. Andy split some logs and stoked the fire under the stew in the den. He had a bit of coffee before heading out to the yard.

He sat on the veranda, facing the mountain, which released mist from its trees into the sky. The morning was particularly quiet. Andy couldn’t remember the last time his head felt so clear.

He sat, just existing, soaking in the stillness for several minutes.

Suddenly, Morwen emerged from the double doors, carrying two shortswords. “Time for sword drills!” she said, breaking the silence, tossing a sheathed weapon to Andy.

Instinctively, Andy caught it. The handle was about 6 inches long, with a plain hilt and modest crossguard. The Scabbard was plain leather. He drew the shortsword, examining the blade. About a foot and a half of double-edged steel.

The blade wasn’t particularly beautiful, but it was hefty, weighing a few pounds.

*Solid*.

“The shortsword,” Morwen said, “is a common weapon. More versatile than many give it credit for.” She unsheathed her blade. It was almost identical to Andy’s. “These are common shortswords, blades that a commoner could buy for a day’s wage at almost any forge or outfitter in the region. They’re a mainstay for travelers and low-level security. Even the Supreme Ministry’s Domestic Guard often carry shortswords as a side-weapon.”

Andy rose to his feet and gave his sword a test swing, spinning it around in his hand.

“Now, like the staff, we’re going to cover some forms, and then some drills. Ready to get started?”

“Absolutely,” Andy said.

Although he tried not to let it show on his face, he was excited. The staff training had been fun, but he was finally dealing with a proper blade now. Sure, it wasn’t the greatsword he had envisioned for himself, but it was a *sword*.

“Now, notice that there are two sides to the blade,” Morwen said. “That means the sword can slash from both sides of the weapon. Take care when you use the sword, because, if you are overpowered, your opponent could find a way to push the blade back on you and cause some damage… I’ve seen it happen before.”

Morwen raised her blade in one hand, bringing it down forcefully in a diagonal motion, once from her right shoulder to left hip, and then again from left shoulder to right hip. “You can hack and slash, like so. This is going to be effective at closer range if your enemy doesn’t have sophisticated means of blocking your attacks.”

Andy tried it. He hacked downward across his torso, once from right to left, and again from left to right.

“Great,” Morwen said. “You can also slash upwards. You follow the same motions in reverse, but you need to adjust your wrist like so.” She lowered her sword to her left hip, turning her wrist to face upward, and slashed up to her right shoulder.

Andy copied her. It was coming intuitively.

“Perfect,” said Morwen. “One thing to watch out for, since you’re right handed, if you slash upward from right to left, be sure to maintain control. You can easily overshoot and bring the blade back on your left shoulder or neck if you aren’t careful.”

Andy practiced the swing again and immediately realized what she meant. Brandishing the blade in his right hand, he noticed that slashing upward from his right hip was the only attack that utilized the backside of the blade so far.

“And you can also pierce your opponent with the tip of the blade,” Morwen said. She lunged forward, thrusting her shortsword straight ahead.

Andy did the same. They reviewed the moves so far, repeating them all a few times until Morwen and Andy were both satisfied with his progress.

“Now we move to blocking,” said Morwen. She raised her blade horizontally over her head. “This position can counter an overhead swing if you can’t dodge out of the way.”

Andy raised his sword over his head, holding it parallel with the ground.

“Now, if your opponent is using a particularly forceful attack, you may need to fortify your blade with your other hand. This can be dangerous if you’re not careful, as you can slice all the fingers off your left hand. But with proper technique, it can provide an effective boost to your defensive capabilities.”

Morwen held her blade over her head again, but this time, she ensured that the flat of the blade faced her before pressing her palm against the end of the blade.

Andy mimicked her. As long as the flat of the blade was facing him, the palm and fingers of his left hand wouldn’t be harmed.

“And be sure to keep your fingers on *your side* of the weapon,” Morwen said. “If you don’t, you could easily lose them to your opponent’s weapon.”

Andy pushed his blade over his head again, bringing his palm to rest on the flat of the blade, this time ensuring that his fingers remained behind the weapon.

“Now, when you’re fighting an opponent who is also wielding a shortsword, more often than not, you’ll be blocking from the upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right vectors.” Morwen brought her blade horizontally downward to the left, upward to the left, upward to the right, and downward to the right.

Andy did the same.

“And finally, to counter a piercing thrust, you push your opponent’s blade outward with your own,” she said, demonstrating a parry.

Andy copied her.

“Fantastic,” she said. “Your form looks solid, now follow this sequence,” she said. She demonstrated a sequence of attacks moving forward, followed by a sequence of blocks moving backward, and finished with a roll on the ground.

*Those damned rolls*, Andy thought.

Andy copied her. It took him a few tries, but after a while, he got the form right. He even nailed the ground roll.

“Finally, we’ll need to practice some drills,” Morwen said. “I will offer a series of three attacks, and you will block them in the way that we practiced, then we’ll reset and you will offer a series of three attacks on me.”

“Alright,” Andy said.

“But since we’re drilling with bladed weapons, it’s important that you be very careful, and that you attack with about half your full effort. No sense in getting hurt for a low-level drill.”

Andy held his shortsword in a defensive posture.

Morwen shot forward and slashed from the top left.

Andy blocked it with his shortsword, the sound of metal ringing out across the otherwise silent grove.

She then brought her sword across to his right side, using a backhand slash.

Andy blocked it with relative ease, the clashing steel reverberating across the landscape once again.

Finally, Morwen brought her blade straight down from overhead.

Andy brought his blade up, using his palm as fortification. It stopped her attack.

“Very nice!” Morwen said. “Now it’s your turn.”

Andy pushed ahead, slashing downward, upward, and thrusting forward.

Morwen met his attacks with blocks of her own, each blow resounding with the sound of steel.

They drilled for another few rounds before Morwen finally stopped, satisfied. “I admit, you’re much quicker at **\[martial weapons\]** and **\[combat\]** than you were at **\[athletics\]**. I’m impressed.”

“Thank you,” Andy said.

“We’ll test you tomorrow, and, as long as you perform well, you’ll earn your first **\[martial weapons\]** rank… you’re well on your way, Andy.”

Morwen excused herself and Andy found himself alone in the quiet yard. Already, he had learned the basics of two weapons. He was by no means an expert, but he felt more confident in his own abilities than he ever had in his life.

\*\*\*

“I can’t believe it,” Pliny said, fuming with rage. “I can’t believe they’ve done you like that.”

A light drizzle had set in, so Andy, Morwen, Pliny, and Noel ate stew at the dinner table in the den. Noel’s cut of the treasure from his adventuring job still hadn’t arrived.

Clearly, Pliny had either forgotten or had chosen to ignore Morwen’s advice from the night before. He was simply too angry.

“It’s not right,” Pliny said.

“Maybe they’ve been delayed by the rain…” Noel said, holding his head in his hand as he stirred his soup haphazardly.

“Who was this group?” Pliny said. “I have no patience for swindlers. I’ll make sure they never contract another fighter I know ever again!” He slammed his fist on the table, causing Noel to flinch, sitting upright. “Sorry,” Pliny added softly.

“It’s nobody,” Noel said. “I’ll pay them a visit on Wednesday. I’ve got to go into town anyways…”

“If you don’t have your treasure by then, I’ll deal with them more harshly,” Pliny said. “Seven trolls. Singlehanded… what a slap in the face.”

Andy felt bad for Noel. He was such a gentle man, and he wasn’t at all invested in his own wealth. He had mentioned using his cut of the treasure to take care of his mother, who could use a new living situation. And, by his reports, he had accomplished an entirely improbable and heroic feat, defeating seven trolls. Andy hadn’t yet seen a troll, so he didn’t know exactly what level of difficulty they posed, but judging by Pliny and Morwen’s reactions to the story, it was a great accomplishment.

“It may still turn up,” Andy said. “And if it doesn’t, we’ll get this resolved.”

Noel smiled. “Thank you, Andy.” He took a bite of soup.

“Andy has his first **\[martial weapons\]** test tomorrow,” said Morwen.

“Oh, how splendid,” Noel said.

“What weapons did you choose?” Pliny asked.

“Staff and shortsword,” said Andy. “That’s what Morwen recommended.”

“It’s a good starting point,” Pliny said. “I tell you… staff fighting is sorely underrated. Especially among the up and coming generation. They want to work with flashy weapons immediately.”

Morwen nodded in agreement.

“That’s what I hear,” Andy said, smiling. He could tell this had been an ongoing conversation between them by the way everyone at the table nodded in agreement.

They ate the rest of dinner with intermittent small talk, the fireplace crackling sporadically. Noel and Pliny said they’d join Morwen in the morning to watch Andy’s first **\[martial weapons\]** test. Noel retired first.

“Join me on the veranda for a pipe?” Pliny said to Morwen and Andy.

“Actually, I wanted to speak with Andy tonight,” Morwen said. “If you don’t mind.”

“Oh, not at all,” Pliny said. “I’ll have myself a solitary smoke and count the ratfolk in the woods.” He chuckled. “Another night, then?”

“Absolutely,” Andy said.

Morwen invited Andy to come up to the third floor. They climbed the ladder through the hatch and sat in the high-backed chairs where a dim oil lamp burned on the side table, illuminating the spines of the many small books on her bookshelf.

Andy glanced at their titles: *The Obsidian Knight*, *A Sorcerer’s Tale*, *Seven Valiant Tales*. They appeared to be popular works of fiction, not reference books.

“You’re a reader?” Andy asked as he sat down.

“Ah, yes,” Morwen said. “It helps my mind relax before I go to sleep. And I’ve always enjoyed adventure tales, ever since I was a little girl.”

Andy smiled. “Which one is your favorite?”

She looked at her shelf, glancing across the spines. “Hmmm, that’s a tough choice. Like choosing a favorite among a circle of close friends…”

Finally, she selected a book, removing it from its place on the shelf. “This one, I think,” Morwen said. “It’s old-fashioned, but I don’t think I would have become a fighter if I hadn’t read it as a teenager.” She handed it to Andy.

The title was simple: *The Virtues*.

“That one is not really fiction, actually,” she said. “It’s a work of philosophy. But it’s not a dry tome… it’s quite accessible for commonfolk. You can borrow it if you’d like.”

“Oh,” Andy said with surprise. “Thank you.”

Andy held it on his lap as he leaned back into his chair. He glanced over at the dresser across the room. A rose light pulsated gently, emanating from underneath.

“What would you like to know about the Order?” Morwen asked.

“Oh, I… uh…” Andy hadn’t been expecting such a direct and open question. “I guess I… well… it seems like you’d want me to join at some point, unless I’m reading things wrong. And, well, every time I began asking about specifics, it had to wait until a later time, which I totally understand. But now that you ask me directly… well…”

“Let’s start there,” Morwen said. “After you’ve received the appropriate training, if you want to join the Order of the Behemoth, we can move forward with that process. Your admittance isn’t guaranteed of course, but I suspect you’d have a very good chance.”

“I suppose my first question, then, is what the Order actually does, like day to day. Pliny filled me in on some of the history, but I’m still unclear on what membership would entail.”

“A good question,” Morwen said. “The basic mission of the Order is to guard against tyranny, as I’m sure you’re aware of by now. In the past, that meant that the Order would frequently take up arms against tyranny of all forms, including organized crime, invaders, and, perhaps most frequently, against the nobility itself. Our order began during a very dark time…”

“The Continental War?” Andy asked.

“Yes, precisely,” Morwen said. “About two centuries ago, the Supreme Minister Re Morum felt the need to expand Cresthaven’s territory to the entire continent of Palima. Some suspect he was drunk with power, others suspect madness from warlockery… whatever the case, no one could stop him. The Supreme Minister has veto power over the House of Law, has command of the army and the Elite Guard, and, if he wishes, can assume control of the Domestic Guard as well. And that’s just his constitutionally afforded power. The Supreme Minister also enjoys the informal support of countless powerful groups. As you might imagine, many spellcasting guilds like the **Warlocks**, **Wizards**, and **Enchanters** fall over themselves to work with the Supreme Ministry.”

“That’s… a lot of power,” Andy said.

“It is,” said Morwen. “Too much for any one person to wield alone… but nonetheless, Cresthaven’s constitution allows it. So, Supreme Tyrant Morum levied crippling taxes on the populace, cut funding for all public works, and directed all resources into his mad dream of conquering the continent. Most families couldn’t put food on the table, which worked to the tyrant’s advantage… It was a great recruitment tool. Most young men were more than happy to join the army. It was the only way they could earn money aside from a few professions like forging and enchanting.

It was a dire situation, and that was when a group of fighters known as the Order of the Behemoth emerged. Originally, they were a revolutionary group, bent on overthrowing Cresthaven’s entire system of government, but before they could craft a new state, they had to grow in power. A very famous founding member of the Order, Devir Penwraith, one of the greatest **Fighters** who ever lived and one of the greatest strategic minds of Palima’s history… he devised a plan. Since Cresthaven was expanding across the continent, he travelled ahead of the front lines, warning powerful rulers and sages of the coming threat. Those powerful individuals across Palima who organized resistance to Cresthaven’s expansion were known as the Thirteen Dissidents. Largely thanks to Penwraith, the Dissidents formed an organized and effective campaign of resistance, crumbling Cresthaven’s frontline abroad.”

“There were only thirteen of them?” Andy asked.

“Well, there were thirteen leaders. Some were powerful spellcasters, others were rulers of large cities and kingdoms. Penwraith established the Council of Dissidents, and after some negotiation, they were able to set aside their differences and unite against the looming threat. Armies, covens, circles of druids, bands of thieves… they all came together to sabotage Morum’s expansion. Although they’ve had no need to act in the last couple of centuries, the Council of Dissidents still meets on an annual basis, facilitated by the Order of the Behemoth.”

“What do you discuss?” Andy asked.

“Well, lately, nothing. In fact, many of the members no longer see the point. They have other, more pressing problems… memory is short. But the Order of the Behemoth must continually remind people that the threat of tyranny is real… but I digress.

After the Dissidents dissolved the expansionist front, the Order was able to recruit many commonfolk, defectors, and even some sympathetic **Fighters** from across the continent to stage a revolution that lasted ten days. After the revolution, they ousted the Supreme Tyrant. But… this is where things started to go wrong… they didn’t amend the constitution to restrict the powers of the Supreme Ministry. Instead, they relied on the Order’s popularity and their power, both local and continental, as a constant, looming threat against the abuse of power by the nobility. For all his work abroad, it’s largely agreed upon, at least among revolutionary theorists, that Penwraith’s Ten Day Revolution didn’t go far enough. It didn’t change the system of government that allowed a tyrant to take power in the first place. Nonetheless, the Supreme Ministers ever since the Ten Day Revolution have largely capitulated to the Order… they’ve distributed resources and comforts to the commonfolk paid for by taxes levied on the nobility, they’ve guaranteed proper trial for those accused of crimes, and they’ve refrained from any expansionist tendencies.”

“That’s what Pliny was saying,” said Andy. “But he also said the Order is dwindling in numbers and influence now. How can this political arrangement last if the Order is disappearing.”

“Well, that’s the thing,” said Morwen. “It can’t, and it won’t. The people have enjoyed the fruits of the Ten Day Revolution for two centuries. The threat of tyranny is like a distant memory, studied in history classes but not taken seriously in day-to-day life. It’s no surprise, then, that the Order’s numbers have dropped. People don’t see the point.”

“Mmmm,” Andy nodded. “Sounds like a bad situation. Pliny said the next in line for Supreme Minister was… not a good guy.”

“That’s correct,” said Morwen. “But we don’t have the numbers to wage a significant resistance to the Domestic Guard, much less the army. So our tactics have changed, which brings me to our day-to-day operations. We have two basic pieces of our strategy: first is education and recruitment. Folks like Gerran, for example, do their best to influence the hearts and minds of the noble-born. Oftentimes, such a task seems futile, but it is absolutely necessary. In the event of a struggle against the Supreme Ministry, we’d need as many sympathetic nobles as we could get. Very few noble-born actually join the Order, but many are sympathetic to its cause. The second part of our strategy, perhaps counterintuitively, is exploration.”

“Exploration?” Andy asked. “What does that have to do with resistance to tyranny?”

“Yes, many Order members have the same reaction. Allow me to explain. We have reliable intelligence that some high-ranking individuals in the Ministry, as well as some of those in the Warlock’s Guild, the Enchanter’s College, and the Wizard’s College, are on the hunt for a legendary metalsmithing apparatus known as Cagin’s Forge, hidden in a dungeon somewhere to the west. I can’t give any more details than that to someone outside of the Order, I hope you understand.”

Andy nodded, “Sure, I understand.”

“But let’s just say, if the Ministry finds and utilizes the forge, there will be nothing at all that the Order could do to mitigate, much less prevent, the tyranny that could follow. So, we have our own teams working in the west to locate the legendary forge, and, as much as possible, to sabotage ministry expeditions. That’s really all I can say. If you choose to enter the Order, and if you are admitted, I could discuss more details with you.”

“That’s intense,” said Andy.

“It is,” said Morwen. “And we don’t have the numbers or the public sympathy we need to keep up with everything. And yet we continue.”

“Hmmmm,” Andy leaned back, rubbing his temple. He had a lot to think about.

“But you don’t need to worry too much about everything right now,” Morwen said. “The main thing you need to do is concentrate on your training. Oh, which brings me to a question I wanted to ask you.”

“What’s that?” Andy asked.

“You don’t need to answer tonight, but I want you to think it over and give me an answer tomorrow. Once you’ve achieved your first **\[martial weapons\]** rank, I’d like to send you to Gerran for your second ranks in **\[athletics\]**, **\[combat\]**, and **\[martial weapons\]**. He’s in the outer city. You’ll gain exposure to Cresthaven, you’ll gain a new perspective from a different teacher, and you’ll learn more about things. You’re a bit isolated out here, and I’m sure you’re getting bored of tending the stew,” Morwen chuckled.

“That’s interesting,” Andy said. In fact, the suggestion was rather abrupt. He hadn’t considered such a dramatic change in setting so quickly.

“You don’t need to answer now… think it over.”

They wrapped up their conversation. Andy bid Morwen goodnight as he descended the ladder and headed to bed. Although he hadn’t been here long, Morwen’s Grove felt like home for him. Part of him was bothered by the idea of changing location again so abruptly. But the other, more adventurous side of him wanted to explore more around Cresthaven.

first time posting here, and need your help. 

Recently, I brought this plant to my house, it was at my company office, but the owner decided we should go full remote, thus closing the rented studio we used as an office in Lisbon. This plant was there, and almost 100% of the time, the office was closed (but it had big windows for the sun to enter) and was watered weekly. 

So we went to the office, and the boss told us we can bring anything from there, and I decided to bring this plant (first natural plant at my house, besides the lemon tree on the backyard) and a coffee machine. 

I noticed that recently the soil has started growing mold, and at the office it never had this problem. Is this going to damage the plant? What can I do solve/prevent this?

for context: Iive in Portugal, and it's winter, my house is in an old building, therefore poor insulation and high humidity, every winter we clean the spots or mold when it appears. also this is a rented apartment ",1,1771346812.0,gardening,0,1.0,False

The effluvium of coffee breath and fresh sardines was a whiff I took every morning and have since the first day I can ever remember. It always left a sour tang on my tongue and made my taste buds curl. I learned later on that holding my breath was the best way to get through dad and his too-big hugs and kisses. It comes in a weird bottle, too; the shape of it standing is the basic outline of a leaf blower, and the stilt of it is rather odd as well. Two splashes were all it took for that stench to take over even his strongest cologne. I wondered if everyone else could smell what I could, and all of them have just agreed together to never say anything to the poor man. He’s just walking around with a distinct gagging odor, while taking my advice was never a thought in his mind, and even just considering the thought of my opinion might have spared him from the stink. I can recall as vividly as possible the moment I finally decided to do something about my dad’s aftershave. 

There have been so many gifts over the years that I have bought my father using my own saved money, only to have him collect the new, better bottles away in his closet. He loved anything that came from me, so taking the aftershave as a gift was just as delightful as me handing him a million dollars. I guess that’s what it's like to have kids. I sometimes climb up to the back shelf of his wardrobe to see the multicolored glass collection, doing nothing for my dad but gathering up some dust for him. I talked to my mom about the smell, and she always just smiled and laughed and said, ‘Well, that’s just your father sweetie,’ and that’s all I ever got from her. I went to my older sister, and she just told me how rude I was, even saying things about our dad. Then there was Bruce, the oldest, and he, like always, just pretended like I didn't exist. I really wanted to ask strangers if my thoughts about my father having an unbearable reek were a valid thought, or maybe I was having a little bit of a harsh opinion. What was I even going to say to someone? Hey, do you think my dad smells bad? Who does that? 

It was after the millionth try that I decided to give up on trying to make him realize his issue and took the situation into my own hands. I went to a cheap dollar store, which was all I could currently afford, and I got the fanciest bottle they had. My sister drove me home, speaking to me as if I were actually listening. There was something about a guy named Brad, and I think he is a total asshole, and I think Miranda had something to do with it. I am not sure. I don't listen to my sister. I think that Chelsea is a bit dense and bippy, you know, a complete ditz. I really don't want to call her dumb, but I'll do it anyway. When I got home, I ran upstairs and got my dad’s aftershave bottle from the top cabinet next to his two-sink counter and one massive mirror. I dumped everything, the last drop down the sink of the white porcelain tainted lightly pale blue, watching it disappear into a twirl down the metal drain. I didn't feel bad for what I was doing, to be honest, I really didn’t think I was doing anything wrong. I was helping, right? 

I don't know why I wouldn't think my father would immediately tell the difference in his aftershave. The two burning liquids smelled miles apart. My dad cursed so loud that I thought my eardrums were going to burst. The thriving anger in his tone sent waves of dread over every bone in my body. I had never heard my father act this way in my entire life. I've never even seen my dad get upset over anything or anyone. The man was annoyingly nice.

The whole house went silent. The only sound was my own heartbeat, loud and stuttering in the hush. I could feel every muscle in my body tense, waiting, every second stretched too thin.

I wanted to hide when I heard him belting down the stairs. I got as small as I could in my seat, and I looked down at my cereal like it was the last thing I was ever going to see. My dad reached the bottom of the stairs and looked manic. The way his hair just fell apart after getting put together so well, and how his chin shone from a fresh shave, made my brain stop working. What have I done? Why was this situation so dire? Why was my father acting this radically over a bottle of aftershave? The questions were endless, and all I could or wanted to do was look at the colorful floating balls in my already discolored milk.

He sprinted to my mom first, who was in Bruce’s room, yelling and picking up laundry, which is what I would assume. That was one of her morning rituals when getting the lethargic teen out of bed in the morning, so maybe for once he wouldn't be late to school. My older sister drove me to school, and when I say we were always punctual, I mean we were always fifteen minutes early. I was always stuck waiting on the front stairs of my school building, my ass on cold concrete, my body and mind impatiently waiting for the first bell to ring so I could run inside. The house was too quiet for a moment, and the first thing I saw barreling towards me was Bruce. He picked me up by my collar, my feet hovering over the off-white tiles, and he forced my face to look at him. 

“What did you do?” That's what he asked me. 

My dad and mom came sprinting down the hall, my father only taking two strides before releasing me from my brother’s grasp. The two of them argued for a moment, a disagreement that ended with a ‘yes, sir’. My older sister was now involved, and she was frantic to get her nose into this raw family drama. I sat back in the soft, comforting wood of the kitchen chair, and with my head bowed, I closed my eyes. I never prayed, but right now felt like a moment where I needed to. My father was beyond ticked off, and you could see it in his red, huffing face. He was pissed off. I did this because I was helping. I started this battle, which I had no idea I was getting myself into. 

“Jeremy.” My father’s voice was calm as he bent down to look into my eyes. He lifted up my chin, water already making my eyes wide and glossy. “Did you do something with my aftershave?” When he asked the question, I could see his veins throbbing in his forehead, but his voice remained even. 

This was one of the first times I was this close to my father, and I could stand to smell him. I wanted to hug him so tight while the moment was there, knowing after this tragedy, I would be back to huffing in his god-awful fumes. 

“Jeremy, I need you to tell me the truth.” he put his hand kindly on my shoulder and pulled my chin all the way up so that I could meet his gaze. 

I nodded my head. 

“Okay. That’s okay. What did you do with it”? He was beginning to sound relieved, but I didn’t want to tell him the truth. 

“I... I poured it... in the drain.” My voice cracked, each word coming out in fragments and barely making it past my lips. I wasn’t ready to say it out loud.

“Son, I need you to speak up to me.” His voice was growing increasingly impatient and annoyed. 

“I poured it down the drain.” It was a whisper, but it was loud enough for my father to hear. 

The way he gripped the back of my chair, his knuckles turning pale white, I thought he was gonna splinter the wood. 

“I must have another bottle around here.” He said it more to himself than to anyone else. “Stop standing around,” his yell made everyone jump. He pushed his fingers through his still-gelled hair. “Just start looking around.” He was a bit calmer when he spoke, but the fear and anger remained. 

I watched my entire family as they frantically ran around, sprinting from one room to the next, hoping to find a spare bottle. I knew there wasn't one. Everyone else knew it, too. Dad only orders them one at a time, because they are specially made and very expensive. But rushing around the house made all of them feel a sense of ease, giving themselves the false hope that they are soon to find their treasure. 

“You really did it this time.” It was Bruce, as he even looked in the cabinets in the kitchen. 

“What’s the big deal?” I wanted to know more than anything else in the world. Why was this aftershave important? 

“Dad needs it.” My brother spoke in a tone that piqued my curiosity and gave me a sense of understanding. Who knows why he needs it, but he needs it nonetheless, and even I joined the brigade of searching for an imaginary prize. It was when we all gave up that we walked into the living room and sat down. 

“Well, what do we do?” My mom was panicked and exasperated, and she had no clue how to find an answer to this situation. 

“We just let it happen.” It was my father who sat down in his chair and locked his eyes with me. “Let's see how important he thinks my belongings are after he sees what it does for me and what it does to me without it.” He was stoic and blank as he still sat, his eyes pointed right into mine, as if his stare was to be etched into my mind, before he looked away. 

I took a seat on the couch across from my father and looked down at my lap. My mother was the one who called everyone in for the dad-dialing work and school, shaking her head with shame. Then my mother took a seat next to me and anchored me with her arm around my shoulders. We sat for a couple of hours before everyone grew tense with anticipation. My father never stopped looking at me as his transformation began.

At first, his left eye began to droop so low that his jaw slipped out of place.

I watched as his skin fell into puddles and his body disappeared. A piece of goo was in place of my father, sitting upright but melting.

The blob slid down the chair and began wiggling toward me slowly. Its girth was immense, and the goo was a giant mass slithering toward my seat. I curled my legs up as my mother held me down.

“What’s happening?” I couldn't help but let the fear lace my cry. 

“It’s okay. Just let it happen, sweetheart.” My mother was petting my head, pulling my hair back with slow, gentle motions. 

Bruce and my older sister were sitting around me, motionless and expressionless. I watched as my dad, the glob, rose and climbed over the lip of the coach. 

“Don't let it get me,” I begged my mother as I tugged on her and clawed for help. She just shushed me as if she were calming a baby in distress. 

The melting glob of human flesh reached out to me with a part of its moving body, the fleshy slime collecting and falling together around the mass. It touched my foot, and I couldn't help but stomp on it. Once my foot hit the surface of the gelatin, it was engulfed by its jelly. I threw my body off the side of the coach, wiggling free from my locked prison, and I tried to claw myself away from the thing that was supposed to be my father. 

“Don't fight it, sweetie.” My mother was placid when she spoke, and it made my skin bubble with anxiety. 

“Please let me go.” I cried back at the mass that was collecting my leg. 

I watched as two eyes floated on top of the gel and placed together so it could look at me. The stare of the afloat organs bore into my eyes, and the pupils are so large that the blue is almost invisible. My father sucked me up to the waist, gathering more and more of me. I was whimpering now, my cries for help being ignored. I didn't understand what was happening to me, and I couldn't comprehend why my father would put me through this. The feeling that the suction had over my body was fierce as it blobbed up to my armpits. My arms were still forward, clawing at the ground, my fingernails were breaking and bleeding against the splinters of the floor. The malodorous gas that oozes from the tiny pores all over its body had the sharp tang of tin-can brine, and a cut open tuna. My dad took over my face, and the goo came with force, gobbling me up with pleasure. I floated on my stomach once I was inside the melted flesh. My dad’s insides floated around me, and his bones weren’t there. I couldn't move my limbs while I was inside the jello, but I was breathing just fine. It was just the god-awful stench of sardines, dense as a fish market at closing, that slipped around me like a breeze coming and going with the invisible wind.

My father’s organs began to collect around me, coming together in all the right places. He was lying down on his belly like me, his eyes leering at mine. I could see past him at his completely formed organs, and I could see his lungs inflating and deflating with a soothing rhythm. I looked at the translucent gel, darker than the rest, that flowed in, out, and around his intestines and other innards. To see your father’s guts was a rare sight to behold, and I wished that it was a sight I never got to see. I turned my neck, barely pushing through the mushed flesh that firmly gripped me and I looked at his mouth as it gaped open, strands of dark goo stretching with elasticity pulling up and down as his lips parted. His voice sounded like someone speaking underwater. I wondered if I tried to speak right now, if I would sound the same. His words might have been distorted and garbled, but they were clear. 

“Don’t touch my aftershave.” 

This is all he said as a ripping pain waved up my body. My skin parted. Everything inside me emptied out. Hot pain. Tears pricked at my eyes, stinging and pooling beneath them. The agony went on. Forever, it felt like. At last it stopped. My father released me. The suction spat me out, slow, shuddering. I saw his organs running around his heart. Thump, thump, thump. Everything blurred. Cold floor under me. I tried to breathe. Stillness. I couldn't move. Hands lifted me, turned me, placed me on my bed. Cotton brushed my head. Sheets pressed tight beneath me. I wanted to move. I couldn't. Did he paralyze me? Nerves gone wrong, maybe. My body just lay there. I stared up. The ceiling fan spun, again and again. The air brushed my face. My arms, my legs, trapped, heavy, unmoving.

I lay there for a very long time with no activity around me. Then I heard the door creak open quickly as someone stepped into the room. Whoever it was took long strides to get to me. Then, hovering over me, her fingertips rubbed my cheek. 

“What’s happened to me?” I begged to know, a bit surprised that I was still able to speak since everything else was paralyzed. 

“Dear,” she said with a sigh. “I truly am sorry for what’s happened to you. But understand this, it was your own fault.” Her words were kind, but they helped raise a deep concern. She looked down at me with pity. 

“Why can't I move? Have you paralyzed me?” I was sobbing with snot collecting together above my top lip. 

I couldn't wipe my face, but my mother could, and she did so softly. She brushed my cheeks again and again, and she began to cry with me. I still sat with no explanation on the actions that were done to my body to disable me from doing everything but see, breathe, and speak. 

“We had no other choice, please believe that. But you were the one to touch it, and now you are being punished for your wrongful actions.” My mother was still crying as she spoke. She wiped my cheek, voice all silk and sorrow. “We took your bones from your body, honey.” The clinical words hung in the air, sharpened by the softness of her endearment and the gentle rhythm of her hand. My mother finally let out what I needed to hear. I needed some kind of explanation, and here I got it.

“Where did my bones go?” I was filled with so much confusion, fear, and sorrow, all boiling inside of me, coming out together as tears and whimpers. 

“There is someone I would like you to meet.” My mother beckoned someone over to my side, and the boy came into view. He must have been no younger than thirteen, my age. 

“I am Alex.” The boy introduced himself as my mother held both of his shoulders. 

“Hi Alex.” I sniveled, and a little croak was the only way I could reply. 

“I'm the one who took your bones.” The boy looked down at me with burning blue eyes. Eyes, I have seen pierce into me a thousand times over. 

“Alex is now part of our family, and we will treat him just like any of your siblings, and I am duty-bound to once again take on a child to raise.” She sounded more exasperated than she did  so with angst. 

“Will I live like this forever?” I still looked deep into the boy’s eyes.

Alex combed my hair as my father would, and he said this, “Many will come and go, but I am forever.” I didn't understand what he meant. 

Both of them kissed me on the cheek before leaving the room together, leaving me alone. After a while, Alex came back just to sit and speak with me. I was dumbfounded and angry by what he had to say. 

He let out a sigh, “I really didn't have a choice after you disobeyed me. It was my fault for not telling you the truth, but after discovering the reactions from both of your siblings, I thought it would be better to keep this secret to myself.” I could feel the mattress as it dented in from Alex’s body weight. 

“You took my bones, and you turned into a teenager?” I was trying to make sense of the situation. 

“How else would I be? Your bones are not yet grown, and now I have to live through childhood once more.”  He sounded bitter towards me. “I thought this time I would grow old in one body and die in it with your mother, but you changed my fate, and I will never be able to touch or look at your mother the same again.” He was venting to me, telling me all his frustrations. “I've really never kept myself after forty, having to do this process again and again. I fall in love and start a family to have it torn from me, and the taunting is sometimes too much to bear. “My father let out another sigh. “Listen, I am still something to you, and I will come to you every day so you won't ever be alone.” My father’s promise overfilled me with a scoring dread. 

“Alex,” I was done crying now, and I was still in the process of accepting my fate. 

“Yes?” He called out as if he were waiting for me to ask him something. quick and under a deep breath. 

“How long am I going to be like this?” I needed to know the truth, even if it diminished my soul for the rest of eternity. 

Alex let out a sigh, and he didn't answer quickly, nor was he emotional with his words. “You will grow old just as you are. You will be taken care of, and we will make you are as comfortable as possible during the different stages of your life. I will be here, though. Throughout your whole life, I will keep you warm and safe.” His promises hit me with hope so empty it barely touched me.

“Can you just kill me?” I wondered, thinking I had found a solution to this dilemma. 

“I have not and will not kill the host under any means. You must die naturally. I know it seems harsh, but it feels like the least I can do since I took your life.” He suggested filling himself with hope that I would accept this answer. 

I had to accept this answer. I couldn't get my bones back, I knew I couldn't grow them back, and I knew there was no use in trying to get new ones. How would I even try to get new bones? It's not like I'm going to be taken to the hospital or anything. I knew my parents had a plan in place if this were to ever happen. They have a new protocol when it comes to a dead child. That’s what I was to everyone but this family. I was dead. I whimpered to myself and tried to hum some tune to soothe my bursting anguish. I could feel my father rubbing my leg from under the blankets. It was a fatherly touch that I would keep forever in different forms. Or maybe he will find the one, and he will die peacefully at their side. Alex got up and looked down at me. 

“Do you need anything? Can I make you more comfortable?” His question was a joke to me. 

I didn't bother to reply, and I sat sorrowfully alone once my father left my room. All I could ever do anymore is watch the movement of the ceiling fan above me. ",1,1771346764.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1r7bb7m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7bb7m,Café Lacoste Location Analysis,"Lacoste didn’t open a café just to sell coffee.  
And its location proves it.

Last week, Lacoste unveiled its first Café Lacoste, blending retail, hospitality, and brand experience.  
While far from the first retailer to explore this format, the move says a lot about where premium retail is heading.

Using Geoblink by MyTraffic, we analyzed the Café Lacoste location to understand the strategy behind the opening, from demographic alignment to footfall dynamics and competitive intensity.

The result? A clear example of experience-first retail, grounded in data rather than intuition.
