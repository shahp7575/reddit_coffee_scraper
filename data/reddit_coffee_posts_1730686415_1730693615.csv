When you wake up in the morning, and everything feels heavy, I want you to remember to love yourself today.
When you tiptoe into the kitchen, I want you to pour yourself a cup of coffee and snuggle up with your favorite book and get lost in the words.

When the mirror tells you are unworthy, when the scale deceives you, I want you to make your favorite meal.  Forget the standards the world placed in your hands those aren’t yours to hold. 

When your mind becomes your enemy and you have no fight left, I want you to dance around the living room like you did as a child. Extended the grace, love and patience you freely give to strangers. 

Love yourself today, and let that love carry you into tomorrow.

1gj5tvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/1gj5tvz/my_first_ever_neckbeard_experience/,my first ever neckbeard experience,"hi everyone! when i was younger i used to frequent this subreddit and laugh at all of these insane stories, never thinking id have any of my own. this past year has proven me wrong! for some context, im a 17 year old trans girl and currently a junior in high school. for simplicity sake, ill call the neckbeard stitch due to his obsession with the character stitch from lilo and stitch.

my first encounter with stitch shouldve given me enough red flags to avoid him, but it didnt. at our schools assembly regarding CPR in freshman year, i happened to sit next to him, and the first thing he said to me was ""hey, are you gay?""

i was super offput for obvious reasons because who the hell starts a convo like that. i told him i was actually trans, and he asked me why (thats not really an easy question to answer to someone you literally dont know). we proceeded to have a slow and kind of awkward convo, and the only reason i really engaged with him was because i had just gotten unfriended by my ex best friend and i was extremely lonely. i seriously wouldve befriended anyone, and stitch came to me at the perfect time.

to paint a picture of this guy, i was genuinely shocked that he was in the same grade as me. full neckbeard, galaxy and anime themed hoodies, quite a bit taller than me (im 5'11) and overweight, and he always wore blankets over his backpack like a cape. overall, he fit the typical neckbeard/super senior archetype perfectly, except he didnt smell that bad.

regrettably, he asked for my number after we chatted for a bit and i gave it to him. hanging around him felt very uncomfortable and surreal, and i began to realize i had next to nothing in common with him. one time, this group of guys walked by us in the halls and began picking on him, so he yelled something at them in russian (??) and ran off. he was into typical neckbeard stuff like gaming and anime, and repeatedly told me his dream career is to be a twitch streamer (one time he got 10 viewers in a stream and he bragged to me about it). he also one time made this weird half joke about having nuclear codes and showed me something on his phone that i still dont really understand.

overall, i thought he was really strange and offputting but not necessarily a bad person. he told me he got diagnosed with bipolar, and i honestly thought he was just misunderstood. but then, as sophomore year went on, i learned more and more about him that made him out to be pretty creepy and somewhat predatory.

EVERY time he saw me in the halls without fail, he would hug me. i would never hug him back, and it always made me very uncomfortable but i didnt really know what to say. he also would say little things to me that felt kind of belittling and creepy, like one time when he offered to pay for my coffee and i denied and he told me to ""stop being difficult"". that doesnt sound that bad, but the tone of voice in which he said it felt so creepy, like how a 50s husband would talk to his wife.

another thing is that all of the people he hung out with were either creepy, gross, racist, or all of the above. me and my current friends avoid this group of people like the plague, as do everyone else. stitch was no exception, thinking saying the n word in the school group chat was peak ""dark humor"". he is very white.

the final straw in regards to having any sort of contact with him was when i found out he made an insanely creepy rape joke to one of my friends. i was never told what the joke was exactly, but i dont tolerate shit like that. i already didnt like him at this point, but i finally blocked his number (i had blocked him once already the summer after freshman year, but i think he got a new phone and didnt notice?). that day at lunch, he came up to me and asked why i had blocked him, and i didnt say anything. thankfully, my saint of a friend who i was sitting with told him ""dude, if she doesnt wanna hang out with you anymore, leave her the fuck alone."" and just like that, he walked away and we havent talked since.

this year, ive learned some new information about him from some of his ex friends. hes currently dating a girl who ill call lilo for continuity sake. lilo is severely autistic, and is developmentally behind most people her age. in laymans terms, she acts very childlike and naive. this makes me fear that stitch is taking advantage of her, which i wouldnt put past him based on the weird shit hes done and how one of his friends has SAd multiple people. i find the situation incredibly creepy but i dont know lilo personally so i cant step in. ive also learned that hes made rape jokes to a multitude of other girls. not really surprised.

i hope you guys enjoyed the story of the first ever neckbeard ive ever met! im fascinated by people like him, and im grateful that i never turned out like him even though i very well couldve (im from a conservative floridian town and i grew up in the ""feminist rekt!"" era of youtube). i saw him at the mall today with my friends and he made eye contact with me, and it was honestly terrifying im ngl. all i can hope for is that he and lilo break up and he seriously fixes his issues.",1,1730693169.0,neckbeardstories,0,1.0,False

I’m cutting legs to a coffee table that will taper, and also angle away from the table base.

What angle do I need to cut the top and bottom of my board so it can rotate such that I can cut the leg out of it? The starting board needs to rotate on its axis (I.e. have the top cut from 90 degrees to something else).

1. The Stew Crew have been very busy doing anything except staying at home and enjoying their carnival style backyard. Carlin found time to squeeze in a happy birthday to her childhood BFF, Joy Duggar. She says they navigated heartache together and I can’t help but picture Carlin sobbing into her bunk bed bc JoeJoe Duggar didn’t pick her. Anyway, we see more fit checks and GRWMs with Carlin and the sisters on Kelly’s birthday trip. Not one piece of clothing was from BSB. Carlin treats her mom to a Ralph Lauren Polo sweater before heading home and throwing her peace offerings at the feet of Queen Layla, who was less than enthused at the airport sticker book. Carlin actually has a grid post of pictures from the trip and lots of folks comment that it is good to see Carlin and Josie together again. Someone commented that Carlin’s pics now had Josie’s vibe. That someone was immediately blocked. While Zade is attempting to count he says the number one is five and nobody corrects him but that is just the beginning of Zade’s number problems this week. Carlin can’t stop injuring herself and heads off to The Joint Chiropractor for an adjustment. The poor chiropractor is sweating bullets bc Evan is filming the entire session. Later we learn she sprained her ankle and that is after she sliced her foot open in their garage. Good thing they probably have that cult medical sharing program that might pay their bills… sometimes. Evan takes the kids to Walmart for last minute costumes. Layla chooses her 43rd polyester princess nightmare and Zade wants to be Puh Puh Mah. The day after Halloween a crew shows up to decorate their house with Christmas Lights and we find yet another thing the Stewart’s can trade out for advertising and one more manly man job that Evan will not be doing. This week’s vlog is basically a rerun of everything they have already shown us on social media. On the way to Poppa and Nini’s house, Evan has to crawl in the back and sit between the 2 kids in order to get some content bc filming is limited these days at Poppa and Nini’s. While he is back there, he gets Zade to count from 10 to 1 backwards and he does anything and everything except that. Evan insists that he just counted from 10 to one and Carlin pretends to be super proud. They show us Carlin’s homecoming from the birthday trip and right on queue… there is Gil Bates in all his glory. He came to pick Carlin and Kelly Joe up at the airport. If anyone ever questions Gil and Kelly’s relationship Carlin will be the first to show proof of life.  This week’s vlog is sponsored by a mattress company and Layla gets the extra mattress. I don’t want to know why she needed a replacement mattress. With absolutely nothing else to do, the Stew crew heads to Gatlinburg for the day. It’s a chance for Carlin to dress her kids up in winter clothes even though it is 80°. It’s a workday for the kids as they film reels, vlog content and stories. They walk around filming themselves with people in the background and set their camera up to film them eating ice cream together. Totally normal family stuff.

2. Katie shows off baby Harvey’s Delta wings. One month old and already a flying pro. Katie is barely in the door before she is posting links for everything she used on the trip. The Clark’s score a major brand partnership with a baby monitor company and go all in on exploiting Hailey and the new baby by filming a nighttime routine reel. Katie is giving away gift cards for comments… It’s an old influencer trick to up engagement and keep the brands happy. Gotta spend money to make money. Katie is strapping baby Harvey down to a snoo bassinet every night. He is zippered in after being swaddled and then comes the velcro. It is too much for my claustrophobic ass to watch.  Travis found time to get a new vlog out and they show us how packed they are in that apartment with SO much gifted and grifted STUFF. The camera comes along for baby Harvey’s one month check up and Travis tells us the baby is in the 1st percentile for height and the 5th percentile for weight. Being teeny tiny did not stop them from slapping him on a plane. Katie goes on and on about how the newborn phase is already over, and I just don’t understand her concept of time. she did the same thing when she was 31 weeks pregnant and saying she was at the very end.  Travis is very excited to announce that he will be running away… I mean going on tour…the first few weeks of December with some Christian band that is doing a Christmas concert, but he will not be singing Christmas songs. He tells us this is a really big deal and Katie let us know that she will be showing up for some of the shows. Travis goes on and on about how Katie is a super mom and asks her how she feels and of course it is all rainbows and daisies and sunshine. Something behind her eyes tells me that may not be exactly true. But Travis needs to cover his self before he heads off on a tour bus… and now we know exactly why they are back in Tennessee. Just to prove how grown-up Harvey is already, he heads to church in a button-down polo shirt and old man sweater. Hailey is dressed in black boots and a short plaid skirt… sorta like Britney Spears but a 2 year old version. 

3.  Josie used her mom’s birthday trip to film tons of content for her pool noodles that just will not die. She tells us she is enjoying all of the baby snuggles with baby Harvey… Meanwhile, her own baby got left behind.  To celebrate the beginning of holiday shopping, Josie says her effortless beauty shop will be giving away one heatless curler. One measly little pool noodle…you really shouldn’t have. While on the trip, Josie films all three sisters and Kelly Joe with the pool noodles in their hair. The baby is squalling in the background and Katie really looks over it. She also films a What’s in my purse video, which is an excuse to sling links.  Back at home, Kelton is ready to show us Josie‘s favorite steak… which is a frozen slab of meat fried in meat fat and drowned in butter.  Back to her normal influencing schedule, Josie gives us a coffee tutorial, shows the girls in their pajamas in bed and then locks herself in her bathroom to film an ad for a $55 make up brush. Josie scored a major brand partnership with an organic baby formula company. She says she breast fed Miles for seven months but now needs formula. She showed herself on her trip pumping and saving the milk so is she giving the baby both formula and breastmilk…Or is she just saying whatever she needs to say to sell formula? In any case Miles is the youngest Balka yet to be put to work. She filmed the ad while they were on their family vacation in Vermont… Further proof that these folks never stop the grift.

4. Checking in with the weepy whiny Websters we see that it is full on fall celebrations. Alyssa, who can never be happy about anything totally, tells us that fall in Florida is not the same as it is everywhere else because it’s hot. She says there are no pumpkin patches to be found. She needs to quit telling her audience the same lies she tells her kids. We see that the Webster children were gifted a new table and chairs complete with coloring sheets that they are allowed to color anyway they want. It’s all set up on totally white carpet in a totally white house. John’s sister takes pity on the Webster girls and invites Alyssa to a waterpark for the day. She agrees to go and spends way too much time training her camera on baby Rhett who drinks pool water and frowns at her camera. She forces him to where the sad hat while SHE wears a baseball cap from another brand. Continuing her genius marketing, she tags her hat company in the lower left corner of the pictures,  in the teenyest tiniest ant font available. After their weekly trip to Publix for free cookies, Alyssa tries her hand at a question and answer session in order to push links. We learn that…surprise surprise. She and John are discussing babies.  Trick or treat time finds the Webster girls wearing career costumes. It seems like a sick joke since we know none of them will ever be allowed to have a career. Just a few months back, Alyssa did a Q&A vlog with the girls and when they were asked what they wanted to be…they said, ballerinas, gymnasts, and mommies.  Alyssa has the costumes all set out on the table and there is no discussion about it. King Rhett is a baseball player of course. Alyssa has now covered the sad hat with fabric and plastered his name where the company logo normally is. Rhett is forced to wear the same jersey he had for his first birthday and Alyssa and John wear their jerseys. They could not be any more obvious in their favoritism if they tried. The girls get to participate in trunk or treat, attend the church carnival AND trick or treat and they are just beside themselves with joy and freedom! On the way to the church carnival Alyssa drones on and on about her coffee… She is the only one in the car who gets a treat, but Allie and Lexi were super duper lucky because they got to order the coffee for their mother. She thanks John for buying her the coffee and he quips that he is “kind behind the eyes. “ That’s not the word I would use to describe what is going on behind that man’s eyes. After all of the fun and frivolousness is over, Alyssa tells us how miserable her day was because she had to go vote with all five kids in tow, and Rhett cried the entire time. It certainly seems like the girls would be old enough to know how to behave in public, but I guess you have to actually take kids out into the world for them to learn that. Alyssa says she was asked to share some of her book recommendations… She actually says Oliver Twist and Moby Dick. I swear she’s trolling.

5. Zach and Whitney love sleeping on the roof of their car stacked up like sardines, 7 deep,  so much that they went again with some friends.  Once they were back from their second camping trip in as many weeks, it was time to get back to work slinging links… The two of them sat down to rave about Abeka homeschooling. After selling their children’s education, Whitney went on to sell or link or promote 11 different items, including a weighted baby sleep sack, which is very controversial and many pediatricians do not recommend them. Bradley turned 10 this week and is the oldest grandchild. 32 kids in TEN YEARS…. Whew! Zach showed up at the boutique to tell us his four favorite outfits that he would like to see his wife in. Just what we need… A man showcasing women’s clothing and telling women what they should buy. Where are Whitney and Carlin? Because they certainly aren’t working at this shop! If there is not a photo shoot, they don’t seem to be around. This week in the Bates Kitchen, Kelly Joe is back to help keep Zach on track as he makes what he calls his mom‘s famous macaroni and cheese, but what his mom calls aunt Jenny‘s famous macaroni and cheese. I have never seen  macaroni and cheese made this way, in layers. Their secret ingredient is crushed saltine crackers. That is not an ingredient in any macaroni I have ever had… But it is a way to stretch a dish and try to make it more filling when you are poor and have a ton of kids to feed.

6. Well, well, well guess who is back on YouTube after telling the world that they would not be posting just any old thing and planned to be very intentional with what they shared?? Such a coincidence that at the very same time the Paine family is about to be homeless… The Fundie princess is back, yall! Erin Paine is here to enlighten all of us on the proper way to feed and water little soldiers for Christ! And who could that possibly be behind the camera? Is it the talented and very busy construction guru himself? You would think he would be off building a church instead of following his wife around while she dips and dives and is clear as mud explaining her grocery haul. Seriously though, Erin did appear somewhat desperate and definitely not ready to be transparent as she explained that she shops at Costco once a month and weekly at Aldi and Publix. She wants to appear to be a clean cook/eater, but there were tons of prepared foods in her haul. I guess time will tell if they can get enough views on these types of videos to start making money from YouTube again. She isn’t totally relying on YouTube though… She has also released a new doodle project… This time, a tiny calendar with a tiny flower on each month along with a tiny scripture verse. How original. Everything in their shop is 30% off as they celebrate the third anniversary of Erin leaving the boutique in a huff. Obviously Chad unlocked her phone because she also spent the week promoting her churches tent revival.  Baby William is now one, and Chad and Erin celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary. Kelly Joe called Carson by his name and not Charles in her birthday post to William so I guess that didn’t stick.  Erin gushes over Chad in her anniversary post and in return, Chad is silent. She shows us that they are away on an anniversary getaway to Ormond Beach. Who has the kids? Erin says she struck gold with Chad…. Fool’s gold IS a thing…

7. Trace and Lydia did not dress Ryker up and did not seem to participate in Halloween… They did take him to a pumpkin patch. Trace headed out of town and Lydia had her sister come stay with her. They went to Gatlinburg to see the sites and take 1000 pictures of Ryker. The entire video was the camera stuck in Ryker‘s face while Lydia tells him not to touch it. She eats a donut with her sister, and then tells us all that miracle of miracles…Her family has been given another year to stay here in America and figure out what they are going to do about their possible deportation. She says that she is still trying to separate herself from her family’s case.  Someone in the YouTube comments says if they want to stay in this country they should vote for Trump… What?? Soon enough Trace is back home and they head out to a university of Tennessee football game with Josie and Kelton. The vlog is sponsored by a bedding company, and Lydia scored a sponsorship from an online company that creates Christmas cards. Ryker stars in her ad. Don’t count Trace and Lydia out as child exploiters because they are really ramping it up. On Sunday, they are front and center at daddy Gil’s church.

8.  Tiffy Bates has been to the Nashville Zoo more than 100 times in one year! Talk about a person with a lot of time on their hands… It was no surprise that they dressed Will up in a costume that Tiffany’s mom made and took him to the zoo for trunk or treat. Lawson has a real saying that people just don’t understand why he won’t to hurry back home… But it is because he has a newborn baby… The only man to ever parent, apparently. Tiffy put baby will in a carved pumpkin and takes pictures of him. She encourages people in the comments to follow her husband’s YouTube to see updates on their family… I don’t understand why they are so hell-bent on keeping their separate accounts. They both spend the week pushing their YouTube vlog links, but it is the same video that has been up for two weeks. They continue to fall behind with content.

9. The Keilen’s were in the pulpit this week on YouTube, once again preaching about jealousy. Michael spends most of the vlog trying to make us believe that she was jealous of people who got married before her because she was single for so long. She got married at 25! She also says she has struggled with her weight, and had jealousy issues about her looks versus how some of her sisters look. Brandon mainly talks in abstracts and never gives any real life examples. Towards the end of the vlog, they talk about being jealous when others are blessed with children and how they handle that. It’s the same old song and dance from them and it just doesn’t feel genuine. It is also like popping two Tylenol p.m.… So if you need help falling asleep…

10. Bits and Bytes: the prices at BSB are ridiculous… they are now selling small throw blankets for $50 each, slippers are $65 and short robes for $76…in the age of Amazon/Shein/Temu, who is buying this overpriced junk??… for the second week in a row Jinger Dugger featured the Bates and their boutique on her and Jeremy‘s Vlog… the boutique was live on Instagram almost every day, pushing items and not one time did we see Carlin or Whitney at work.

Have a great week friends and remember… November belongs to the turkey!

1gj5nnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1gj5nnc/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates ,"1. The Stew Crew have been very busy doing anything except staying at home and enjoying their carnival style backyard. Carlin found time to squeeze in a happy birthday to her childhood BFF, Joy Duggar. She says they navigated heartache together and I can’t help but picture Carlin sobbing into her bunk bed bc JoeJoe Duggar didn’t pick her. Anyway, we see more fit checks and GRWMs with Carlin and the sisters on Kelly’s birthday trip. Not one piece of clothing was from BSB. Carlin treats her mom to a Ralph Lauren Polo sweater before heading home and throwing her peace offerings at the feet of Queen Layla, who was less than enthused at the airport sticker book. Carlin actually has a grid post of pictures from the trip and lots of folks comment that it is good to see Carlin and Josie together again. Someone commented that Carlin’s pics now had Josie’s vibe. That someone was immediately blocked. While Zade is attempting to count he says the number one is five and nobody corrects him but that is just the beginning of Zade’s number problems this week. Carlin can’t stop injuring herself and heads off to The Joint Chiropractor for an adjustment. The poor chiropractor is sweating bullets bc Evan is filming the entire session. Later we learn she sprained her ankle and that is after she sliced her foot open in their garage. Good thing they probably have that cult medical sharing program that might pay their bills… sometimes. Evan takes the kids to Walmart for last minute costumes. Layla chooses her 43rd polyester princess nightmare and Zade wants to be Puh Puh Mah. The day after Halloween a crew shows up to decorate their house with Christmas Lights and we find yet another thing the Stewart’s can trade out for advertising and one more manly man job that Evan will not be doing. This week’s vlog is basically a rerun of everything they have already shown us on social media. On the way to Poppa and Nini’s house, Evan has to crawl in the back and sit between the 2 kids in order to get some content bc filming is limited these days at Poppa and Nini’s. While he is back there, he gets Zade to count from 10 to 1 backwards and he does anything and everything except that. Evan insists that he just counted from 10 to one and Carlin pretends to be super proud. They show us Carlin’s homecoming from the birthday trip and right on queue… there is Gil Bates in all his glory. He came to pick Carlin and Kelly Joe up at the airport. If anyone ever questions Gil and Kelly’s relationship Carlin will be the first to show proof of life.  This week’s vlog is sponsored by a mattress company and Layla gets the extra mattress. I don’t want to know why she needed a replacement mattress. With absolutely nothing else to do, the Stew crew heads to Gatlinburg for the day. It’s a chance for Carlin to dress her kids up in winter clothes even though it is 80°. It’s a workday for the kids as they film reels, vlog content and stories. They walk around filming themselves with people in the background and set their camera up to film them eating ice cream together. Totally normal family stuff.

2. Katie shows off baby Harvey’s Delta wings. One month old and already a flying pro. Katie is barely in the door before she is posting links for everything she used on the trip. The Clark’s score a major brand partnership with a baby monitor company and go all in on exploiting Hailey and the new baby by filming a nighttime routine reel. Katie is giving away gift cards for comments… It’s an old influencer trick to up engagement and keep the brands happy. Gotta spend money to make money. Katie is strapping baby Harvey down to a snoo bassinet every night. He is zippered in after being swaddled and then comes the velcro. It is too much for my claustrophobic ass to watch.  Travis found time to get a new vlog out and they show us how packed they are in that apartment with SO much gifted and grifted STUFF. The camera comes along for baby Harvey’s one month check up and Travis tells us the baby is in the 1st percentile for height and the 5th percentile for weight. Being teeny tiny did not stop them from slapping him on a plane. Katie goes on and on about how the newborn phase is already over, and I just don’t understand her concept of time. she did the same thing when she was 31 weeks pregnant and saying she was at the very end.  Travis is very excited to announce that he will be running away… I mean going on tour…the first few weeks of December with some Christian band that is doing a Christmas concert, but he will not be singing Christmas songs.

Whenever I ask her questions she won’t even respond to what I asked and says stuff that just is a response to if I said something stupid. I asked her to approve a shift for me that I picked up 5 days ago and she never approved it. She’s like “you need to put it in the system and then the only way is for me to approve and I hate when people do it the day of” and I kept saying to her I put it in on awhile ago and she just keeps repeating that it needs to be put in and she needs to approve it and she won’t see it if it’s the day of. She just speaks to me like I have brain damage. Also my other manager treats me this way as well. I go “are we out of coffee?” He goes “um no it’s where it always is” and I’m like I don’t see it? And he was like the box and I’m like oh the one that’s really high up and I can’t reach? And he’s like “there’s a step ladder” and I’m like okay. He also does things like walks around does nothing and then is like “were you about to wipe that table?” Even though it’s not mine which is fine but sorry I’m greeting my table? Or he is about to run food then he sees me and hands it to me and walks away.

What I need is a small (13-14.5 inch) laptop with good ram, strong processor that will last at least 8 years. I have a desktop for at home, but I am finding myself working on the go a lot, and my old Yoga pad is really struggling. Portability and relatively small size are important, since I work on public transport and at coffee shops with small tables (that said, my 11.5 inch laptop might be too tiny). A dedicated gpu is not necessary, but if the laptop is cheap on a good sale, I wouldn't mind it. I would really appreciate some thoughts from people who have this model, or a comparable XPS in the line.

I love the look and feel of the new XPS models, but I am concerned about the keyboard and trackpad. Is the new trackpad okay, and do you get used to it? Does it slow down your efficiency? And the keyboard - I tested it out at Best Buy and it did feel weird that there wasn't a gap between the keys. Do you get used to that as well, or does it substantially decrease your words per minute? Lastly, what about the F# keys? I don't use them all that often, so I don't mind them being haptic feedback ""buttons"", but are they okay? Can you get it to light up ""F1, F2, etc.""?

I am also looking at things like the Samsung Book 4 Edge, Asus Zenbook, and things from HP (Lenovo has burned me one too many times). I do have some minor brand loyalty to Dell, as they have been so good to me since I was a kid. Again, I'd really appreciate some advice - buying a laptop is so hard with all the choices out there.",1,1730692261.0,Dell,1,1.0,False

I recently visited Japan, and I had a Boss (the coffee company) branded soda (I believe it was lightly carbonated) beverage that I am trying to identify.

It was a white colored drink, and I used google translate on the label, and I want to say it said something like ""lactose and citrus flavor"".  It was a creamy drink with a hint of citrus, so that matches what I was tasting.  I was hoping to find it in the states at local Asian grocers (since they carry a variety of imported beverages from Japan), but haven't had any luck.  i tried looking it up online, I can't seem to find it using different keyword combinations on google.  It was available in select boss vending machines.

Can anyone help me identify this drink?  There might be zero hope of me every getting to try it again, but I would at least like to know what it was called so I can try to find more info on it.  Unfortunately, I never took a picture of it, so I am totally lost on what it actually was.

I’m not from Bangalore, but I live here because I moved here due to work. After being single for an eternity, I feel like I could use some company. Now don’t get me wrong I like the freedom and flexibility that comes with being single but I feel like it would be nice to have someone to be fully genuine and authentic with, no masks. I’m not entirely sure if I want a relationship at the moment but I’m definitely open to the idea if it organically develops into one.

See I know that we are all humans and we have needs, be it emotional or physical or anything really. But what I want here is a genuine connection where we can spend some quality time, get to know eachother and grow and ofcourse meet our needs along the way. I want a genuine companionship where we both can become eachother’s safespace and be the real self without being judged and with genuine respect.

So ideally I’m looking for someone around my age (24 - 30), and preferably someone from Bangalore. Your past or experience or anything won’t be judged as long as you’re a genuinely nice person. Though I don’t have any issue as to where you’re from I’m just letting you know beforehand that I’m only learning Hindi so I’m still not confident enough to speak in Hindi. If you’re into spirituality that’s also a huge plus, because I’ve been exploring spirituality a lot lately. But all that being said those are just some preferences, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t belong to that as well if you still wanna give it a shot reach out to me because good people may come from unexpected places.

As for a little about me, I’m a southie, I work in Bangalore (non tech), I’m mostly an ambivert but I prefer a small circle of friends (quality > quantity). I’m pretty ambitious, and I’m working towards my goal, but don’t worry I won’t be spending 24x7 at my workplace. I’m 6ft 1in tall or 185cm tall, I’m in shape, but I’m working towards being fit (started gym recently). I’m little on the duskier side and I have a beard which is well groomed. As for my interest, I love gaming, doodling, football, cafe hopping, cinema, and travelling (mostly solo). A little escape to the nature on weekends are the best. I’m generally a very simple guy, I enjoy all the simple things in life, be it as simple as a walk in the park or just treating myself some good coffee. A few things to note, I’m a vegetarian (I don’t mind if you’re not a vegetarian), I don’t drink or smoke either (I don’t mind if you do, as long as you know what you’re doing and you don’t harm yourself). That being said, I love some good food, good drinks (non alcoholic) and some good music. As for my taste in music, I’d listen anything from coldplay to Metallica to travis Scott to AP Dhillon. As for my taste in movies, I like anything that’s funny or thought provoking, sometimes I do like some action and horror. Yeah I guess that’s enough yapping about myself, rest let’s interact and get to know eachother.

Now, after reading this if it resonates with you, then hit me up, give me a small intro to begin with and let’s see where it goes.

New Draft:

I arrived at Mrs. Wright Keppen’s Spanish class around 1:30, exhausted and in the middle of a caffeine crash after too much cafeteria coffee. The fluorescent lights were blinding, making me feel hungover, and as class began, I struggled to keep my eyes open. Beside me sat Ella, one of my friends—the shy but sweet one who’d nudge me awake if I drifted off.

As Mrs. Wright Keppen discussed Día de los Muertos, my mind wandered. I was already halfway home, thinking of a nap, and, well… John, the guy in front of me, my 'man-crush.' One thing Ella and I had in common—besides the sleepiness—was that we were both ‘LGBTQ’; she was lesbian, and I was bi.

Outside, a roar sounded overhead—like a low-flying jet—rumbling through the classroom. We all rushed to the window, faces pressed against the glass, to see something crashed near the elementary school down the road. We all tried to refocus as Mrs. Wright Keppen continued the lesson, but the uneasy glances back at the window told a different story.

I munched on a small bag of Lay’s ketchup chips, hoping it would wake me up and calm my nerves. “Jacob,” Mrs. Wright Keppen called to me, “¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?” 

I sighed, “Mi cumpleaños es el Diecinueve de Diciembre.” That meant my birthday is December 19th. 

“Muy bien, Jacob!” Mrs. Wright Keppen replied, switching over to another student for her little questioning. All the while, a massive smoke trail could be seen from the crash outside. 

Outside, flashing lights bathed the street in red and blue, the scene growing larger as more vehicles surrounded the crash site, officers frantically setting up barricades and an impromptu triage. I kept expecting the intercom to buzz, for the principal to come on and tell us what was going on, but there was only silence. No one told us anything. I looked around, wondering if anyone else found this just as disturbing.

As I finished the bag of chips, the clock struck two. Only an hour and fifteen minutes to go. Outside, more police officers and a SWAT Truck arrived at the unfolding scene. Suddenly, the nearby tornado siren came to life. 

It screamed as we all looked out to see what was happening. A thick yellow smoke erupted from the crash site, spreading fast and filling the atmosphere. The policemen, firemen, and civilians at the scene began to flee, while others vanished in the smoke. A low murmur passed through the room, students whispering as we kept glancing between the window and each other. I could see Ella’s hand nervously gripping her pen, knuckles white against the plastic.

The intercom crackled briefly before the principal’s voice came through, shaky but controlled. “Attention! All students and staff are to move into the cafeteria immediately! Please remain calm—” A loud *click*, and then darkness. After a pause that felt way too long, the emergency lights blinked on, dim and cold, casting strange shadows on everyone’s faces.

Outside, the smoke filled the atmosphere, making it impossible to see. The tornado siren also stopped, and so did all the police and emergency sirens. 

Ella’s face had gone pale, her lips pressed into a thin line. I felt my breath growing shallow, mirroring the same trapped feeling creeping through the room. The opaque yellow smoke felt like a wall, hemming us in, without knowing what might be hidden within.

Mrs. Wright Keppen guided us to the cafeteria, where the other 1,223 students waited for an update on the weird situation. The room echoed with worried whispers and people desperately trying to contact loved ones but to no avail. Staff members could be seen sealing the ventilation and stuffing slits in the doors with cloth as if they were trying to keep the smoke from getting in.

Me and Ella sat beside Ben, Alex, and Saphine, who were in our little friend group, or what we call ourselves, The LGBTeens, since I’m bi, Alex, Saphine, and Ella are lesbian, and Ben is gay. 

Ben kept checking his phone, eyes glued to the screen despite no signal, while Alex held Ella's hand tightly as if to anchor herself. Saphine, the anxious one, bit her lip so hard it was turning white, her eyes darting between us and the doors.

I shut my eyes, hoping this was some strange nightmare, but to no avail. Principal Fischer and Officer Klipsch stepped onto the small stage with a megaphone. It felt like the temperature dropped, like watching an executioner mount the gallows. Every whispered conversation fell silent, each of us straining forward, hoping for answers but fearing what they might reveal.

Principal Fischer cleared his throat, his voice echoing across the packed cafeteria. “Students, I need you all to listen closely. There’s been… an incident outside, and for your safety—” He stopped, glancing at Officer Klipsch, who gave a slow nod. “You won’t be able to leave the building until further notice.”

The room erupted with shouting and various questions. Everyone asked the same thing, “What the hell is going on?!” 

“We do not have enough information!” Principal Fischer explained, trying to regain control of the scared students, “But I assure you that we’re working to get more information as fast as possible! In the meantime, you’ll be divided into three groups that will wait in the library, and gym, and stay here. Hold on as we get that information.”

Just wanted to share a little gem I stumbled upon today. It’s called Masseria Caffè, and it’s on PGA Blvd. If you’re into cute, cozy places with amazing food, you HAVE to check it out!

This place feels like a little piece of Italy transported right here. The vibe is rustic yet chic, and the atmosphere is so inviting. The minute you walk in, you’re hit with the aroma of fresh pastries and espresso. 😍

Here’s what I loved:

	1.	Italian Pastries: They have an amazing selection of pastries that are baked fresh daily. I tried the sfogliatella, which was light, flaky, and just sweet enough. They also have cannoli, bomboloni, and a few others that looked sooo good!

      2.	Sandwiches: I grabbed a panino, and wow – so fresh! It had all the best Italian ingredients: fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, tomatoes, and basil on perfectly crusty bread. If you’re a sandwich person, you’ll love this.

	3.	Espresso & Coffee: The coffee was on point! Smooth, rich espresso that makes you feel like you’re in piazza in Italy. 

	4.	Atmosphere: It’s a great spot to just relax or get some work done. They have cozy little tables and lots of natural light. Perfect place to chill and unwind.

It’s definitely my new go-to spot on PGA. I highly recommend it if you’re in the area and looking for an authentic Italian cafe experience. Bonus: the staff is super friendly and helpful if you need recommendations!

1gj5ccn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dull_Bowl_1144/comments/1gj5ccn/taking_time/,Taking Time,"In my apartment, the midday sun at this time of year feels like a spotlight, relentlessly exposing every streak on the windowpanes and every speck of dust floating in the air. It’s almost obnoxious, as if it’s strutting around like a teacher’s pet: “Look at me, shining bright and unyielding! Enjoy me now, because I’ll be gone for the next four months!”

Tonight, as I prepare for bed, I’ll make my rounds with the clocks, eager for that thrilling moment of confusion tomorrow morning. I wake up, bleary-eyed, and glance at the time: “It’s 7… no, wait, it’s actually 6!” Every first Sunday in November, I find myself contemplating a transformation into a more diligent version of myself—one who rises an hour earlier to meditate, exercise, or even meal-prep. In this whimsical alternate reality, I have a dog, and I can picture myself taking him for a brisk walk in the chilly dark while sipping coffee from a thermos.

But, inevitably, every first Sunday in November plays out the same way. Instead of seizing the extra hour, I cocoon myself in my blankets, trying to drift back to sleep, all the while worrying that I’m squandering this golden opportunity to launch a more productive life.

Sure, it’s just one hour. In the grand scheme of things, how I spend it doesn’t dictate the richness of my existence. But with daylight dwindling, each hour feels increasingly precious. As we slip into the final two months of the year, my thoughts turn to how I’m filling my days.

I love the practical suggestion to change the batteries in our smoke detectors when we change the clocks. It’s a simple, potentially lifesaving task that can easily become a reminder for other self-improvement projects. What if we turned this twice-yearly clock adjustment into a chance to list all the things we’d do with an extra hour? Maybe I could commit to doing just one of those things every day until March, when we hand back that hour.

Or, I could simply indulge in the luxury of sleeping in. What if I choose to revel in the extra hour, free from the pressure to be productive? I recall a clever reader of *The Morning* who once advised waiting to change the clock until an hour on Sunday that you want to experience all over again. Picture redoing a cozy brunch with coffee and bagels at 10, or luxuriating in a leisurely afternoon lie-down at 2.

“A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life,” Charles Darwin declared, sounding rather pompous. Yet, his achievements do suggest a mastery of time management. I’ve often taken such words to heart, using them as motivation to leap into action. But I find equal wisdom in the words of psychologist Amos Tversky: “You waste years by not being able to waste hours.”

So, this weekend, whose advice will you follow? Will you seize the day or savor the moment? The choice is yours.

Me and this guy met through work and instantly clicked. It's the kind of connection that's very unique and I've never experienced before; we laughed and were so drawn to each other despite being opposites. After he left that job, we began texting a lot. He would flirt and initiate conversations; this lasted 2 months. However, I realized we were very different people so I had to cut him off and couldn't keep hanging out with him anymore. I also knew he liked me, but he also seemed emotionally unavailable. One day I called him, I confessed that I liked him, but that we had to stop talking because I needed to focus on myself. He said he liked me, too. I unfollowed him on socials after this, and he reached out to me, but I sticked to my decision. About a month later, I was stalking him online and accidentally followed him. Even though I immediately unfollowed, he saw the notification and texted me. When I didn't reply, he began saying he was confused, why had I cut things off, that he missed our connection, etc. I told him it was for the best. He tried to convince me and then said if I ever changed my mind to contact him. I said I wouldn't change my mind (but my heart was breaking inside, literally I cared about him so much). Then he blocked me on social media.

*3 months later...*

he texts me to my phone number. He says that he respects I may never want to speak to him again, but that ""something came up"" and he wanted to talk to me. He said he was glad to have met me and for the connection we had.

I replied to his message two weeks later saying, ""Hey, is everything okay?"" He replied with, ""It's okay, don't worry about it. It would be better in person. If you're ever around, I'd like to talk."" I asked him if he was truly okay or what was going on and he said, ""I don't want you to worry, I just need and would like to talk to you one day when available."" I replied many hours later: ""Ok. I'll think about it."" Because I was hesitant and emotionally guarded after everything. But deep inside, I did want to see him. I wanted to talk to him once more. Then he replied, ""(My name), I don't know what I did to you, but whatever it is I'll apologize for. I don't know how long I'll have for you to get back to me so don't worry. I wish you nothing but the best.""  I see this message and I don't know what to think or why he is even saying all this??? so I reply 24 hours later with, ""hey, Im really busy these days. But I suppose if you're still up for meeting, we could meet at a coffee shop during my lunch break at work.""

*Then he ghosts me.*

**Why I need advice:** This whole thing where he ghosted me happened a month ago. I don't know why he did it, but I think maybe my lack of eagerness/warmth perhaps made him second-guess himself, fear of rejection, or he realised he is not emotionally prepared as he thought he was for a real conversation (idk what he even wanted to talk about). Or none of the above. But I keep ruminating about this and I can't get him off my mind. It makes me sad my situation with him, because even though I cut him off, I did it for my own good but I care about him so much. And it hurts my heart. *I am in deep emotional pain.*

So, idk...should I call him? Or should I text him? What would I say? It's been a month since all of this, but maybe to have final conversation and figure what he wanted to say to me? for closure? I'm scared though. Please any advice would be great.",1,1730690369.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1gj4ymr,https://www.reddit.com/r/saxoaustralia/comments/1gj4ymr/commodity_weekly_some_weakness_seen_ahead_of/,Commodity weekly: Some weakness seen ahead of critical week | Saxo Australia,"By Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo

# Key points in this update:

* The commodities sector is closing the week with losses, largely led by declines in the energy and industrial metals segments
* Biggest losses occurred across the energy sector, led by continued weakness in natural gas prices amid warmer weather 
* Gold’s record-breaking rally paused with a mini-correction unfolding ahead of next week’s US elections

The commodities sector is closing the week with losses, largely led by declines in the energy and industrial metals segments. Investors and traders have adjusted positions in anticipation of the U.S. elections on November 5—a pivotal event that introduces considerable binary risks due to the high uncertainty surrounding the outcome. This pre-election repositioning underscores the intricate balance between market sentiment and potential economic impacts. The Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index, preferred for its diversified exposure to energy, metals, and agriculture, remains up by roughly 5% year-to-date. Gains in precious metals, soft commodities, and industrial metals have offset declines in grains and energy, with the latter dragged down primarily by a steep 41% drop in natural gas.

https://preview.redd.it/b6mv3cq7ysyd1.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6beb8db626b36a5f21f43017190f65d48ec81a2

# Energy

  
The biggest losses occurred across the energy sector, led by continued weakness in natural gas prices amid warmer weather forecasts in the US and Europe, indicating sluggish demand for heating fuels. Crude oil fluctuated with the flow of news from the Middle East, where an initial slump followed Israel’s retaliatory attack on Iran. This was followed by renewed bids ahead of the weekend after Iran threatened further action, potentially via proxies that it backs in Iraq. Additionally, speculation about another delay in OPEC+ plans to restore curbed production, stronger-than-expected US economic data, and China’s stimulus efforts helped stabilise and support prices ahead of key support.

Hedge funds have for now adopted a sell into rallies strategi in crude oil, and combined with an already weak position in the fuel products, especially distillates, amid global demand worries and excess refinery capacity, the directional risk from a positioning perspective seems increasingly skewed to the upside on any supportive change in the technical or fundamental outlook.

# Precious metals:

  
This sector experienced a small weekly decline after gold’s record-breaking rally paused with a mini-correction unfolding ahead of next week’s US elections—a major risk event that had recently driven prices higher despite rising headwinds from robust US economic data and increasing yields, which could reduce the pace and depth of future rate cuts. Depending on the election outcome, we see the risk of a USD 100+ correction next week, especially if the results prevent one party from gaining control of the White House and Congress—an event likely to heighten concerns over excessive government spending, potentially pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio higher while fuelling inflation fears.

Overall, however, we maintain a long-held bullish view on gold supported by concerns over fiscal instability, safe-haven demand, geopolitical tensions, de-dollarisation driving strong demand from central banks, Chinese investors turning to gold amid record-low savings rates, and recently, as mentioned, increased uncertainties surrounding the aftermath of the US presidential election. In addition, the US Federal Reserve is despite a less dovish tone following a number of strong economic data prints still expected to cut rates on November 7, potentially supporting additional demand for bullion-backed ETF’s.

https://preview.redd.it/b34n5pibysyd1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=6caf8bd0b4ce31d198b0a60fbf7b491b64df643f

# Industrial metals

  
The BCOM Industrial Metal Index was heading for a fifth, albeit small, weekly decline, led by zinc and aluminium, following a late September rally fuelled by Chinese stimulus and US rate cut expectations that later dissipated on concerns the stimulus measures would insufficiently address China’s significant challenges, especially with the possibility of tariffs on Chinese exports under a potential Trump administration. Some support emerged after China’s manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up in October, potentially offering sign of improved confidence. In addition to the US election, traders will focus on next week’s key gathering of China’s top legislative body and the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. 

HG Copper continues to find support near USD 4.30 per pound, with upcoming events potentially determining if this level will continue to attract buyers. Our bullish long-term view remains unchanged, supported by solid demand, especially towards the energy transition, potentially creating a supply shortfall as miners struggle to increase production amid rising input prices, declining ore grades, climate change, and increasing regulatory costs and government intervention. The overall uptrend from the 2020 pandemic low appears well-established and would require a weekly close below USD 4 to change that.

Other men would say: ""He seems to want to work with you over me, maybe I'm not as attractive you."" Someone even called him out to his face about his staring at me. Even consumers made comments about his egaerness around me, pairing us as a couple.

He says things like when he gets his favourite snacks from me: your food is punsihment i enjoy (with innuendo tone). 

He got aroused a few times an had to hide it.

He would run up to me, all excited. People said he had golden retriever energy for me.

He would run up to his colleauges and boastingly repeat all of my favourite things with the little details, we were both proud to know these things about eachother and he seemed quite proud of his connection with me.

We laughed a lot together, he would throw his head back laughing.

He told me he loved my smile and that everyonbody loved me.

I offered to run a mock exam with him so i could practice his care. And he said with the brightest red face, ""im too nervous to do it with you or anyone i really care about.""
I said back: you care about me?
He said: : “of course i care about you, you know that”
I said: “i know i was just teasing, i know you care, you've demonstrated that well.
Wey shared a warm smile. And he said in a thankful tone: “youve done plenty to help and enough (insert my name he said it softly and with a low voice)”:

He bought a blue suit for an exam that determined his future because i told him women like blue and there was at minimum a 50% chance of assesors being women. Then he started wearing blue everywhere and even cheekily commented on it to me.

If i was giggling with someone else he would insert himself in on the joke but not get too jealous.  However one time he called me over from another giggling conversation with someone else(approrpiate for the dynamic we work in) and he started teasing me with jokes about things realted to my feild of work that he knew grinded my gears"".

He would often get tounge tied or stammer, or make jokes to me that didnt quite work out.

We had many private in jokes.

He told me i have an impressive memory and that he like my leadership and skill set.

He would tease me a lot.

He would laugh all the time with things i said and throw his head back it was such a big laugh.

Hed say things like: ""you bet you will see me tomorrow [insert my name]. You have a lovely night."" It was husky.

He would defend me on things.

He would ask for my permission and advice on things he had jurisdiction over.

A junior told him that he is more cheeky and talks a lot more with me then anyone else. He replied with “thats her payment” (i still dont know what this means).

He would tell me he would think of things i'd say all weekend. He bring me memes in to show me of funny things to do with his home country.
He would tell me his fears, hopes and dreams.
He was really tender and soft to me, he would chuckle softly with a gleam in his eye.
Often i would see him looking at me in wonder.

A boy at work asked me out that made me uncomfortable, he would be protective. After my work time finished but his didn't, one of his colleagues in his speciality told me he talked about making sure i felt ok, and that he hated that guy, and he was a creep. He also told me if i wanted to die of boredom i could go and waste my time with him.

He hates sweets and initially rejected a cake on offer at a staff lunch. But he ate the choclate cake i made when he found out i made it and told me he loved it.

We bonded over fishing and hiking.

Another time he told his juniors when i wasnt around, that we had to eat all the other cake i made to make to make me feel good, and so i didnt feel bad.

He would spend time with me on projects and talk to me about my opinions and then when i aksed about his contribution, it turned out he wasnt working on that project he was just investing in me (and he has a busy job that doesn't allow for that).

He told me about his siblings and parents.

He would cry when i hurt.

He would look me up and down, checking me out and then go red or cross his legs.

He'd wink at me.
We would communicate with soft and low moans (""mmmmms"") or even without talking we knew what the other was thinking and acted on the situation like a perfect team.

His juniors would leave the room when i came in.

He would giggle a lot and we would talk about silly things like food texture of new foods hed never tried.

He told me his philosophy on life.

Hed excuse his juniors 5 minites early or stay later to talk to me.

We had many private jokes.

He said loudly, [insert my name] youre single.

Him saying he fades and is energy drained around the wrong people. But noted thats not the case with me, and that he finds energy with me. And then him shutting down having other people around, so he can spend time with me. Him  being vocal about this. Him looking visibly happy, impressed (seen, heard and valued) when i said that i had noticed and gave a few examples (indicating that he glowed around me), but then when someone else came into the room, he got tired and ran off to his room. He later said i got that correct.

He would share damning secrets with me.

Me accidently making a come here gesture with kissy lips, and him rushing over red faced and eager to talk about anything.

When i would giggle with someone he would come running over straight away.

He would look at me acorss the room and look back at me when he walked away after, or from our conversations.

He was always VERY intentional with his words, body langauge and everything with everyone, me and our consumers. And that was one of things i admire about him, how he used his intellect for good and to better relationships, better things for me or things for others.

He told me i should follow him to his next work place for 6 months.

He would listen to me over his boss and even come to me for lots of advice and he would go out of his way to help me with things too.

He would seek my eyes out as soon as he entred the room.

He would get close physically behind me to take things off the shelf.

We talked about baby names together.

He told me his hardships and philosophys and world views.

He told me where he lives.

We made up a new coffee tradition at lunch to spend time together we would bring the others but we would just walk and talk together. When others tried to join he would close the invitation (and he confirmed he did that to me later when i asked him about  it).

He would get jealous when the guy from down stairs would come up to drop off things and we got on well. He made comments that had tone laced with annoyance.

He would glow around me and everyone started to tell me how much he had opened up, glowed and thrived because of me.

He told me he wants to work with me forever and its a condition of any job he accepts.

I batted for him behind his back so he could get his dream job there permanently, which he'll return back to soon.
_________

He would tell me about his fiancee. He got engaged just before we met eachother (like a few days) he said it took him forever to get engaged to her but that it was over due so he had to do it (8 years). We were talking about baby names together and he said she had different ideas to him and that ""i guess he couldnt have it all"".

He said she was frustrated with his exam process and he seemed so exhausted from engaging with her. Even when he got off the phone with her at work he looked wrecked. He said she was always on his case to get stuff done at home, made an exhuasted noise and said he never got a rest. 

When i asked him about his wedding a few months later he said he had no plans to start planning his wedding and was kinda abrupt and said he just got engaged. In my circles people get married within months, they get engaged to get married because they love eachother and enjoy eachother... not just a tick box on the relationship progress bar, or to give someone a ""shut up ring"".

He doesn’t have a photo of his partner on his phone (only his dogs) on both lock and home screen.
___________________
One day he was so intense then out of the blue mentioned some thing he found hard about his partner. That afternoon i went away and cried by the ocean because i was sad of not being able to be with him and i felt like a toy if he had no intention to end things with his fiancee (we worked near the ocean). The next day he found me first thing in the morning and said he had seen me running to the car crying and he checked in on me. I didn't say anything because i was at work.

I was pretty sad and i needed to know if he had intentions to follow through on his actions.

I later planned an out of work social and he came, he walked me to my car alone and i asked him about everything. He said he is happy and denied feelings for me. I told him i would not be uncomfortable if he did like me and was welcome to end things respectfully with his partner FIRST if he is unhappy and approach me outside of work and that i would be happy for him to do that.


I said explained how he cant do those things to me at work and that it also demonstrated unfaithfulness to his partner.
I called him out on painting his partner in a bad light and flirting with me when he KNEW i was single and that he knew what he was doing with his flirty actions.

I told him i was sad because i didnt know what to do with these actions when i knew he was engaged.

He said sorry, he didnt say much else.

I asked him to stop if he didnt like me.

After that he  continued flirting, blushing, staring, laughing, winking at me to the point others continued to comment.
He wanted me to follow him to his next workplace and :that it would be the dream"". We talked abut how he is the male version of me.
_______

Anyway its been 3ish months, i now work elsewhere because i was only contracted to finish when he did. He is coming back to work at that place in 3 months. I havent seen him for 3 months too.

He seemed so full on to me for 6 months and then when it was our last day he hardly said anything to me except: you will be ok amy.

I am so sad. When i tried dating other people in that in 6 months i worked with him a the start of this year,  i would falsh back to his face all the time. I couldnt connect with them because (i realised) i loved him and was thinking about him.

I was on holidays with my family last weekend and my mind kept expecting him to walk around the corner, or my mind would drift to how he would fit so perfectly in my family and this holiday.

I cant stop dreaming about him, i keep waking up in the morning from dreams about him. And I've just had so many intrusive memories and thoughts of him. Almost like flash backs and flash forwards. I have strong gut feelings that i need to go get myself over to see him. Or stong gut feelings that i will see him again.

This guy is intelligent and intentional so i know he was not dumb enough to not know what he was doing. 

So why would someone do something like this?
1) Was he bored at work and i was just a toy for his amusement and entertainment?
2) did he actually fall in love with me? 
3) Why did he follow through with persuing me after our conversation, if he didnt follow through with being with me?

We are so compatible. I would go so far to say if soul mates existed, he was mine.

He clearly does not love his fiancee otherwise he wouldnt do what he did, talk bad about her, and he wouldnt have had those involuntary reactions to me (blushing, arousal, remembering every detail about me, genuine excitement to see me like a golden retriever etc).

I receive a lot of feedback that i am a happy and optimistic  and fun person who is easy to make friends with and brings people together. I relate to this being true and work acitvely towards making myself better at this. I even get sunshine themed gifts.

However after him... i feel so low, like i've lost a limb by losing him. I tried putting up walls because he was engaged and all of them got broken down. He really cared and went out of his way/ put himself on the line to look out for me.

My ex 6 months before him...we had plans to marry. We looked at houses. We planned for kids. I helped him through all of his exams, learnt the material and ran mock exams. He cheated on me with two different girls separately. And  he told me i would not get a right to have any insight in to the descions around any kids we had together lives because i was the female....so i dumped him.

The guy before that tried to get me into his car to do not so great things. I got away to a public place but he still held me down and did other things. 

... i guess after this most recent 2024 man, probably one of the strongest connections I've had, and most similar person ive ever met...i have lost a lot of confidence and happiness.

He was a nail in a coffin of my prior to relationships which i let go with surprisingly more ease then this recent guy. I feel like a worthless human that guys can just do whatever i want to. Ive lost confidnece in my human vaule. Why would this recent guy do these things while he was engaged? Am i really just a toy for everyone to use.  Sometimes i feel so bad and used i dont want to be around anymore (but i know i have other great things to live for).

Had a double pickup, same customer order this morning. Picked up the pancakes from IHOP and went to McDonald's for the second pickup which was two iced coffees. Cashier bagged the drinks and was about to hand it to me but some manager or supervisor stepped up and took it from her, saying I need a insulated Doordash bag or I won't be allowed to pick up. 

Restaurant instructions has nothing about bags, and I've never had an issue before with them. Told the supervisor I'm not with Doordash, it's ubereats and I'm just a pickup driver. She says she doesn't care, it's all the same, and I need to have a bag or I need to leave and cancel the order so another driver can pick up. 

I straight up asked if she was having a powertripping episode over this right now? I'm not a minimum wage cook, I'm doing this on my spare time, I'll text the customer and wait all you need. 

Supervisor gave in and handed me the drinks, warning me I can't return unless I have a bag. 

So I complete the drop-off, go offline and call uber. It turns out even though I haven't registered a delivery bag in the driver's app, I can still be matched to restaurants that require a bag, and they are allowed to ask me to cancel. But they also told me to call before canceling and they'll cancel for me and provide compensation. They also removed the negative rating McDonald's left. So that's nice.

1gj4tx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarDIY/comments/1gj4tx9/any_suggestions_for_my_needs_solar_and_storage/,Any suggestions for my needs? Solar and storage.,"Hello all! 

I have been solar curious for a while and recently I have access to some inexpensive solar panels and an inverter. I also built a barn, and I started thinking about using a solar setup to charge a portable power generator to power my tools. As far as what I would like to use the PPG to do is charge my 18v ryobi tools, power a 12v cooler, and would be amazing if I could also use it for short term camping (a light, a small A/C unit, and maybe a coffee pot or that 12v cooler, not all at once). 

As far as PPG I was thinking something like this EF ECOFLOW Portable Power Station DELTA 2, 1024Wh LiFePO4 (LFP) Battery, 1800W AC/100W USB-C Output, Solar Generator(Solar Panel Optional) for Home Backup Power, Camping & RVs https://a.co/d/97AF1pJ

Unless anyone thinks I can get one or build one cheaper than 550 dollars.

As far as the solar side of it I have been debating a solar trailer or permanent station on my barn roof. Advantage of the trailer is I can take it with me, hook it up to the PPG and possibly extend my ability to work off grid. Advantage of putting it on the barn, I have a gambrel style roof so I can fit 4 panels in a south facing position and just forget it, I can charge my PPG but I can also run lights and more significant machines (drill press, sanders, router, vac, port tablesaw) off of the PPG or the panels themselves with an inverter if the PPG is gone. 

I am really open to any suggestions or possible problems with my setup/ideas. I can space out purchases if they will be very expensive, I just don't want items I buy to be obsolete. So I would rather buy 1 bifacial high output panel than 4 cheaper panels to equal the same output. Hope I don't sound like a total noob I watch a lot of DIY setups on YouTube and research best I can, but especially with prices now I'm not sure if building or buying a PPG is best idea.",0,1730689805.0,SolarDIY,0,0.5,False

I am due for my Botox but unfortunately had to push it off for family emergency reasons. 

I'm not vomiting, just nauseous, but of visual disturbances in the outer corner of my eyes, and also sensitivity to sound and light. 

What do you do when you're dealing with a long migraine ? I'm getting really frustrated, I haven't had to deal with this since Christmas last year. Trying to get some safe options for relief before I see my doctor on Tuesday. 
Thank you !

My uncle dad also committed suicide as well as his fathers father. My uncle did this out of nowhere it seemed... after walking down and grabbing coffee and ciggs for my aunt who treated him like absolute dog 💩 and belittled him constantly and just said the most horrible things you could ever say to even your enemy let alone your actual husband, he walked downstairs put a pillow over his 🔫 and aimed at his face and... it was awful. Just to be clear I was never present when he did this nor when my aunt talked to him like that but my mom (her sister) was. Anyway I haven't talked to my cousin much over the years (I used to live with them when I was in high school and moved up to MD from Texas) but he has since reached out to me a lot recently just needing to talk to someone about what happened that morning. He blames himself and feels since he practically lived next door (1 or 2 streets over) that he should've somehow saw the signs. I just want to know if any medium may be able to help my cousin speak to his dad if he'll come through idk how that works or if they maybe have a message for him. I just don't want him to follow in the steps of all the men on his dad's side of family now including his dad too. I do feel like he (uncle) did this because of my aunt and want to know myself if any medium could reach out to him for me I'd ask him why he felt thus was the best answer or if he did it himself or did she actually do it or her son.... there's just a few unanswered questions and they're really affecting my cousin.",8,1730688663.0,Mediums,2,1.0,False

Want to meet someone naturally but is online dating my only  choice?,"hello everyone,  I moved back home and im now finishing my uni studies online. in some months time my studies will be over.

Im worrying about turning 30 and being single.  sorry this is long. im so lost. I walk around and see couples and I imagine lots of guys not all but lots of guys are taken at around my age. I might never meet the one.

I have a best friend and an another good friend but they are studying post grad many hours away. I have no one to hang with back home here and the guys around here that ive seen and no disrespect they just drink nd are not interested in other things , leaning about things etc!

I feel lost. I hate myself because I have about 60- 80 pounds to lose. Despite this when I was at uni I sometiemes still got hit on, apparently I have a cute pretty face. but this weight will take maybe a year or two to get off and I can't run it off as I have bad joints although I can brisk walk,  Im sure il feel better and look better but its  no guarantee il meet the one :/

I feel lonely. I don't hang with anyone here now ive moved back.

I keep reading on Reddit that 30 is the wall and it gets even harder bc guys have more of a choice for younger women, this makes me feel worried. The bonus Is I look younger than what I am. Some people at uni even thought I was  there age.

I worry im in a dash to find a good man. I wish it would happen naturally and my fam keep saying it will happen when I least expect it. Thing is I live in a town and feel limited but if I move I might feel even more lonely. Do I travel on day trips out and still live at home and go to museums and coffee shops on my own ? I just feel like that won't happen though. Also I had a really scary experience on a dating app years ago and I like the thought of meeting someone naturally and not looking for love ?? it seems abit forced but it seems to be the way people are meeting now? so many choices and filters its a minefield.

Do I focus on losing weight first.?  do I stay and try to sort things out here? I live rent free and my fam member is very kind but they have anxiety and talk about their health a lot and that also gets me down..",4,1730688504.0,DecidingToBeBetter,12,0.7,False

I was initially going to purchase their $40 starter 2-pod set, but held off after noticing two things:

* Shipping fee is a stiff $30 for any order under $60, making the starter pack effectively the same price as the $70 5-pack (I'm in the US).
* They only accept PayPal, with no option at all to pay with cards.

Has anyone else had this unusual experience trying to buy SealPod products? I kind of want to double check that I am not on some sort of phishing site, because I have never seen an online shop where PayPal is the only accepted form of payment. I have basically no PayPal experience FYI.

Moreover, are there any other ways to brew a stronger espresso with custom beans using Original or Vertuo Nespresso machines considering that my current reusable pod systems aren't really working well, or should I just drop $300 on an actual espresso maker instead?",2,1730688121.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1. **Land Use**: Approximately 30% of Brazil's land area is used for agriculture, making it one of the top agricultural nations globally.
2. **Major Crops**: Brazil is a leading producer of several key crops, including soybeans, sugarcane, coffee, corn, and beef. It is the largest exporter of soybeans and sugar in the world.
3. **Diverse Climate**: The country's diverse climate allows for a wide range of agricultural activities, from tropical crops in the north to temperate crops in the south.
4. **Economic Impact**: Agriculture plays a significant role in Brazil's economy, contributing about 5% to the country's GDP and employing a substantial portion of the workforce.
5. **Export Strength**: Brazil is one of the largest agricultural exporters, particularly to countries like China and the European Union, making it a vital player in global food supply chains.

I was asleep on my left side, got up as usual and bam! room was spinning. I was so dizzy that I ended up hugging the Oval Office for a good while. I had no idea what was going on. Had my husband call 911 and was taken to the hospital. I just remember this evil, violent spin that almost hurt. The next day this PT guy came to my room and suspected BPPV in my left ear. He did a series of Epley. It didn't really help. I went home and was in my room for 5 days. 

Got another episode in July, twice in same day, but they weren't as violent. The first occurred in bed when I stretched out. The second when I rolled over. I vomited and then it seemed to be ok. 

The last episode happened end of July, again when I woke up. This time it was different. I was sick for 6 hours, vomitting nothing at one point...heaving to the point my ribs hurt. I took Meclazine and Zofran...got the chills and fell asleep. Felt better when I woke. 

All episodes had Nystagmus. I felt like I was on a people mover for months and months...like the risidual from my episodes just lingered. 

Since then I saw a PT for 6 months which helped, but she never was able to see anything, but didn't think it was BPPV. 

Saw and ENT beginning of year which was pointless...though it said same thing...thought it was neurological. Hearing test was great. No issues. 

Saw another ENT recently. Hearing test was great, no issues. Though he suspects Menieres. I am to get an MRI next week. 

A few things I've learned since. Viatmin D was low, before my 1st attack I got vertigo for a few seconds, would look down and it'd go away. Noticed up to the attack I'd get these weird outer body brain zaps things where it jolts me. Scary, but lasted a few seconds. They happen in sleep, too. Head beats to my heart beat, but no pain. Sinuses hurt often, but no infection. Sometimes if I get upset, I can feel a little off. 

I do not have loss of hearing that I can tell or my tests have suggested....though I can hear my heart beat, woosh, woosh sound and my right ear when all is quiet and rings often (3 to 4 times a day) but just for a few seconds. Right hear also is muffled or rattled when my kids scream. Like somethings in it rattling. Sometimes loud noise bothers me. Laying flat for long periods of time freaks me out and feel it contributes to my off feeling. 

I don't drink  coffee, but have an occasional acaii, don't eat that high of sodium foods. Blood work came back a few weeks ago and everything was fine. I don't feel any ear fullness...at least that I can tell. 

I am on Ozempic to lower my A1C as when I was in hospital it was on higher side. It's lowered now. 
Other than that, I take a nose spray every now and again. I am perimenopause. Healthy otherwise, just hormonal changes as I turn the page to life's other chapter.

Yesterday, I was at Target and got another one of those brain zaps and it scared me. It was really off putting. I felt those in and oit sensations like 6 times yesterday and woke me a few times in my sleep. I'm deathly afraid of the attacks happening again. I try to move on, but my not so good moments bring me back every time.

I wasn't able to do a M&G until yesterday because I was out of town the month before. The house was pretty messy during the M&G, which the owner acknowledged. She mentioned she's ""sort of a hoarder"" and I *thought* she said she would be having a housecleaner come before I was scheduled to start. I got there today and the house was still a complete mess and the owner said the cleaner wouldn't be coming until Weds (so that would have required me to stay 3 nights with the house in its current condition). There was literally crap piled high on every surface, no room in the fridge for me to put my things, underwear on the living room floor, dirty dishes in the sink and on the coffee table, two bottles of *sleeping pills* on the coffee table that the dogs could have easily gotten into if they tried, it didn't seem as if the bed had clean sheets, the towels didn't look clean, and the balcony was covered in dog poop (something she said would be cleaned up before I started). There was also a huge bong and weed paraphernalia lying around and the real kicker is, she was growing magic mushrooms in the spare bathroom. My husband took one look and said ""this is totally unacceptable"" and that I would not be staying there.

As I was reporting all of this to Rover's Trust & Safety team, I got a text from the owner asking me to leave the apartment immediately because she could hear my phone conversation on the nanny cam, which she definitely did not make me aware of. Luckily Rover handled the situation well and assured me they would do everything they can to find a new sitter (ideally someone who can board the dogs at their home so they don't have to stay at the owner's home) and given the severity of the situation, the owner might actually get removed from the platform. The crazy thing is, the owner is also a Rover sitter so you'd think she would know better. The whole situation has left me feeling awful and wary of dogsitting in someone else's home again, at least not without properly vetting it well in advance.

One other thing that happened - I noticed yesterday that she had only booked for one dog. When I went to modify the booking for two dogs (one of which is a puppy, so more $), the price doubled. I felt bad mentioning this the day before I was scheduled to start and we agreed to meet in the middle in terms of price, but it's something I wish I would have caught sooner.

Background: Krista and I are both 30F. We went to high school together and were very good friends during that time. We never hung out on weekends, but we both have strict parents so that was the norm for us. We were super close during the week though. We went to separate colleges, I stayed in our hometown (Las Cruces, NM) and she went to a school out of state. We still saw each other during breaks and hung out, but didn't keep in contact a ton during the regular school year as we were both busy with college lives. We would still text, facetime, snapchat, etc though. When we would hang out on breaks, I'd usually drive to her family's place (1 hour away) as she never learned to drive. She would thank me but that's all, she would never offer to pay for gas or treat me for anything as a thank you. It was still super fun to hang out, and we always had good time. I graduated college a year early and went to grad school right after (at the same school I went to undergrad). She graduated and then went to medical school at a Caribbean school (super far away) so we lost touch a bit as she didn't come home as much and was busy with the demands of medical school. She then moved to New York City after matching to residency to become a physician, and I was thrilled for her.

Now: I currently work as a nurse. I still live in Las Cruces, I love my job but it doesn't pay a ton, so I currently work a second job teaching to make ends meet. I have always had a rough time with friendships and was a chronic people pleaser in my 20s, but am working to improve that. I have lost a lot of friends over the past few years as they were almost all one-sided and with people who weren't the greatest. I still have stayed friends with Krista though, as we had a lot of good memories together and usually have a great time together.

A few months ago, I visited Krista in NYC after she invited me to visit during her spring break. The flight was long and expensive, but I figured it would be worth it, as I was super excited to see her (we haven't seen each other in over a year at that point) and I was very excited to visit NYC for the first time. She told me to stay with her in her apartment; it is a studio, but plenty of room for the both of us. The day I got in, she texted me that she had to pick up a night shift and to let myself in. I was bummed but understood, and figured I could at least look more presentable when I saw her given my long traveling day and have the place to myself. She said we could start doing things in the afternoon the next day, but she was going to sleep for most of the morning, so I should go explore.

I went out the next day to check out the area while she was still sleeping. I brought her back some coffee and breakfast and we started chatting like old times. We went out and did a bunch of touristy things, she was a great tour guide and we had an excellent time. I thanked her for letting me stay with her and for showing me around.

The next day, she said we were going to meet up with a girl we both went to high school with who also lives in NYC, named Jessica. I wasn't super close to her, but they were close. Krista knows I don't have a ton of money. Both Jessica and Krista have very well off families who pay for almost all of their expenses (ie they pay for their rent, vacations, clothes, etc). I think that is great for them, but that is not my situation (zero jealousy, truly). She chose a very expensive restaurant for dinner that night, but I didn't say anything as I was just excited for dinner. We get to dinner, and Jessica just says hi to me and then immediately only talks to Krista about her life and things that they have done together. I tried asking Jessica questions and she gave me short answers, then went right back to talking to Krista. When it came time for ordering, they ordered multiple drinks and appetizers. I have a few food allergies (that Krista knows about) so I couldn't eat much of the menu, but I was able to get a salad and glass of wine. They ordered their entrees and then dessert. The waiter even noticed I wasn't able to eat much and brought me some fruit (which was incredibly nice of him). When it came time for the bill, it was close to $400. I went to ask for a separate check, and Krista said we could just split it 3 ways. I was upset as I didn't want to pay for their food, but just paid for it quietly as I didn't want to make a big deal when I already felt awkward.

Jessica invited us back to her apartment after dinner. While they were talking, they were making fun of people who never left their hometowns and that people who don't live in NYC just ""don't get it"", and that people who don't travel out of the country are missing out (I haven't been able to do that yet, which I don't think they knew; I obviously want to travel once I can afford it). They weren't talking about me, but I obviously felt bothered by it. I again didn't say anything as I felt awkward and just laughed along with them.

The night took a further turn when Jessica brought out a bunch of edibles and wanted us to take them with her. I'm not bothered by it, but it's not something I do and my job does random drug tests, so I just told her ""no thank you"". They both kept pushing me to take them with them but I kept saying no, and eventually just went to another room and played with her cats and came back out when they had a movie on and they were chill. It was around 3am when Krista wanted to go home, and she wanted to take the train back. I said I didn't feel comfortable, as Jessica's area wasn't great and Krista was high, plus I didn't really know how to get around quite yet. I said we should Uber, Krista finally agreed. The uber ended up costing $65, and Krista said we should've just taken the train, and didn't offer to pay. We went home and then went to sleep.

The next day, Krista slept in until most of the afternoon, and I went to breakfast and to a few shops on my own. When I got back, she was up and told me she wanted to go get her nails done, and that I could go explore some more. I just said ok, and ended up going to a workout class. She gave me the key to her place as I would be back before her. We did our separate activities, then went to dinner and a broadway show later that night. Everything went well and was normal.

Later that night, my mom called me at 2am saying my dog (who she was watching) accidentally got hurt and had to go to the emergency vet to get stitches (he ended up being totally fine, thankfully). Since we were sleeping, I went into the hallway outside her place to take the call. She was up and asked what was wrong so I told her, and she just said ""oh that sucks"" and went back to sleep.

The next morning ,we were going to head out to go see Central Park and Krista couldn't find her apartment key. She immediately became angry and told me I lost it, since I went in the hallway last night and went to the workout class with it. I said I brought it back both times, as I was able to let myself in, and that she had it all night as we obviously were able to get in/out of her place. She tore the place apart, and asked me to go back to the workout place to see if I left it there. I was certain I didn't, but went anyways to appease her. I even walked through the hallways and elevators of her place. No key. We went to Central Park and she talked about the key the entire time, and that she was going to have to call a locksmith to get a new key, and she didn't want to have to pay for it. She told me to finish walking around Central Park, and she was going back home to look for the key again (the doorman was letting her in/out at this point). I said ok (frankly I wanted to be alone at this point, as I was worried about my dog, overtired, and kinda upset at how this whole trip was going), so she left me there and went home. I finished walking around, she texted me to pick up lunch and bring it back. I said I would as I was also hungry. On my way back home, she texted me that she found the key. It was in her pants pocket from the other night. She didn't apologize once. I asked her to venmo me to pay for her half of lunch and she said that I could cover it as my ""hotel fee"", presumably for staying with her. I was irritated at this point and calmly told her that I paid for the Uber the other night and for part of a dinner that I wasn't able to eat most of. She rolled her eyes but venmo'd me her half. When I weas cleaning up lunch, I went to take her trash out (I had a spinach salad and didn't want it to stink the place up, and she told me to not do that as ""trash bags cost money"". The rest of the night was awkward.

I was worried about my dog and not having a great time, so I decided to move my flight up a day. I told her I needed to go home early because of my dog and she just said ""ok"". I make sure to clean up everything, wash her sheets, etc. She didn't say anything. When it was time for me to go, she was sitting on her computer, shopping on amazon. When my uber arrived, she just said ""bye"", without looking up from her computer. I walked down on my own and headed to the car. She did text me to see if I got to the airport ok, I said yes and thanked her again for letting me stay with her and for being her tour guide. She then texted me a few days later to make sure I got home ok.

I really haven't heard from her, until she called me in tears one night because she got an evaluation at work that said she was arrogant, hard to work with, etc. I pumped her up and gave her a good pep talk; once it was over, she just said thank you and hung up the phone, without talking about anything else. A few weeks later, she texted me ""so I think I have a boyfriend"". I texted her back saying ""tell me everything!"" and she said ""I will tomorrow"". We have both been single for a while given the craziness that is dating nowadays, so I was truly happy for her. But weeks passed. She was super active on social media, posting a ton during that time, so I knew nothing bad was going on. I was a bit irritated so I texted her ""still waiting to hear about this guy"" and she gave me a brief one-liner about him and how they met. I responded that I was happy for her and that was it.

I know our friendship is basically over, but I feel horrible about the whole situation. I feel really upset about it all and I don't know why I can't shake this. I have zero intention of ever reaching out to her again. We haven't texted since the boyfriend news. I blocked her on snapchat but kept her on instagram. She constantly posts on instagram with her other friends and now boyfriend, and I now have very few friends and just feel like crap about it all. I know that sounds incredibly jealous and petty and I genuinely hate that I feel that way, and I don't get how people so easily have so many friends and a boyfriend when I have been struggling so much in those areas. I really never put these thoughts onto ""paper"" but I think that is the root of why I feel the way that I do with this. Is there any advice for how to handle this situation better? Am I just being jealous and petty? What do you think?",2,1730687464.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Gastritis mimicking low blood sugar symptoms?","Does anyone get feeling lightheaded, weak and shaky coupled with extreme hunger / stomach emptiness feeling?  Then, I just start swallowing food and my body craves things like bread or something fatty. When i eat enough I feel relieved, almost like drugged and I get sleepy. I also feel like my mind is suddenly getting clearer.

My blood sugar is perfect, I even measured it while being in this state, also done 3 hour OGTT test and all the other tests.

I have gastritis, mild esophagitis and hiatal hernia. Im also looking into SIBO or something similar as a root cause. Generally, I have a great amount of gases and my stomach is bloated most of the time. Gases are especially in the upper part of the digestive system and I also don't burp. 
These shaky low blood sugar feeling has been happening before if I drink coffee, and I haven't eaten a ton of food before. I see it as adding s layer of fat protection to my stomach. If I fill my stomach with some heavy food e.g. from bakery I can even drink coffee.

This first happened 4 years ago after I lost some weight and changed my diet (reduced all the bad stuff significantly)and I have developed panic attacks and bunch of other staff, POTS symptoms that were bad but went away now came back. This all kinda resolved in the meantime, but I was eating a lot, my weight was 106 kg. After losing weight and skipping meals for 2 or 3 months it came back with a vengence. Both times these flares happened it was after losing weight and skipping meals for a while. I just feel like my stomach and my absorbtion is somehow screwed up.
