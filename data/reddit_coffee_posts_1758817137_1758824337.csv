1nqe7sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1nqe7sq/weird_side_effect_of_dieting_everything_smells/,Weird side effect of dieting: everything smells stronger,"⚠️ TMI warning lol ⚠️ 

I started my weight loss journey at 80 kg on July 10 and I’m now down to 73.8 kg thanks to sticking with a calorie deficit and doing Zumba a few times a week 💃. It hasn’t been easy, but I’m proud of the consistency so far.

One thing I did not expect, though, are the weird little side effects. Ever since I cleaned up my eating and cut back on sugar/processed food, I feel like my sense of smell has gotten noticeably stronger. I catch myself noticing scents I never really picked up on before and sometimes it shows up in very unexpected ways 😅.

For example, coffee makes my pee smell strongly like coffee, and when I eat salmon, well… let’s just say my poop smells like salmon. Before I started dieting, I never really noticed these things, but now it’s like my body is way more “transparent” about what I put into it.

Has anyone else experienced something like this when losing weight or changing their diet? Is it just my body adjusting, or do other people find their senses get sharper too? I know it’s a little gross, but I’m curious if this is actually a common part of the process!

1nqe7e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nqe7e3/i_feel_like_ive_just_had_enough/,I feel like I've Just Had Enough,"We are both adults 30+ F and M in a relationship for a few years.  The first year was fun, happy, exciting, sensual and pretty much great 90% of the time. The last two years things have just gone downhill gradually due to his behavior towards me. I am early 30's attractive, petite, friendly, adventurous, responsible in that I have my own house, money, cars, career etc. It started gradually with the way I dress and him saying things to me like "" those shorts are too short"" ""pull your shirt up I can see down your shirt"" to making me sit next to him in a booth in a restaurant always so that he could put his hand up the back of my shirt. He will ask me to put my leg over his leg so he can rub on my leg and this made me so uncomfortable seeing as we're in public and it's just inappropriate and awkward when the waitress comes over to take our order etc. I started a new job and after a while my colleagues started to add me on FB both male and female. He saw that I had accepted a friend request from a male co-worker on FB, I didn't have anyone's phone number, didn't hang out outside of work, just that I had added and he lost it and started in on me with "" Oh, he's single, why don't you go out with him. He's a single dad, look a great opportunity for you. Why don't you get his number, you can get on your knees and suck his C\*\*K, sneak him into your house and let him bend you over and F\*\*K you, you can suck and F\*\*K all night long, Go for it!!!"". He tortured me for two days calling me incessantly with messages saying the most degrading things 100 times non-stop while I was trying to work until I blocked him. Then he would use his office phone, his work cell, even his own son's cell phone, email from 3 different accounts. I blocked and blocked but it was so emotionally draining to keep receiving these messages and harassment simply for adding a male co-worker on social media. He knew I had an appointment coming up the next day and waited until I parked and then jumped into my car. Obviously I should've just dropped him right there, he apologized profusely and I let it go. Then it would creep up again with comments if I looked nice "" Wow, you look nice, getting all the attention you want from guys"" to sitting next to me in a coffee shop where I was thinking deeply staring off into space when he leans over and says "" What?! You wanna go fuck him?"" because there was a man across the cafe and I happened to zone out in that general direction. He was there for me during a very difficult time in my life and was so supportive and kind. But lately he's just unfriendly and controlling about anything I wear, doesn't want me to go to any gym unless I go with him, wants me to be on the phone with him the entire time if anyone comes to work on my house that is male, accuses me of being an attention seeker for dressing nice ( like leather ankle boots, jeans, and a full sleeve sweater that's off the shoulder on one side) and basically acts like I'm just dressing up for other men, if I even talk to another man he starts in asking me why don't I go and get their number and get to know them. Most recently I went to a shop to buy sandals and I was on the phone with him and he heard me talking to the teenage guy running the register and again the same thing about how I'm supposedly enjoying getting attention from a guy and saying that I'm probably going to go back later and get his number.. I have brought it up, not in a rude or aggressive way and when I say anything he doesn't want to hear he will interupt "" Just stop. STOP STOP STOP STOP!!!"". Asking me why I can't just ""be nice"" and if I don't want to talk to him because he's being rude or nasty he'll just harass until I block him and then send messages saying "" Stop being silly"" ""Stop being stubborn"" ""Come on, please talk to me I'm sorry"".  I have explained that I'm not ""being silly"" I'm a grown woman with valid feelings and should be treated as an adult not talked down to like a child. He's started to gaslight me the past few days, for example telling me he really wants to be intimate and cuddle with me which I said I didn't want to. He said ""No you're going to give it to me, I need it right now"" and I said very firmly ""NO, I'm not"". He brings it up again and I told him that I am not in mood at all, that I don't have to ANYTHING I don't want to and that he needs to stop saying things like that to me. He then denies ever saying it. He's started doing this and it's insane, he will say something to me and then flat out deny that he said it just a few minutes later right to my face!  Today I gave him two opportunities to talk about a specific subject and he just interrupts and shouts over me saying to shut up and let him explain, by this he usually means he's going to list excuses for how I ""made him"" act a certain way, do something abusive to me, say something awful to me etc. Tell me that I'm a ""button-pusher"" which generally means that I said something he didn't want to hear even if I say something true in a non-confrontational way. He doesn't want to hear it. There are many more stories that go back that are similar, I'm just to the point now that I can't sustain this level of stress and abuse from someone that I do care about and who has in the past been there for me in hard times.. I can't do it anymore.  I feel guilty because he is in a difficult situation at the moment for something that he put himself in and that he deserves what's coming to him. He's out of control throwing himself a pity party and lying to himself telling himself he's the victim and lashing out on me because of it. I feel badly and I really want to relieve myself of the burden of him. Not really a question, but I had to say it somewhere.",1,1758824078.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1nqe6w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1nqe6w4/plant_light_helped_with_turmeric_staining/,Plant Light Helped with Turmeric Staining,"I came across a post about using the sun to help with aligner discoloration for turmeric stains, but with all the rain lately I had to get creative. I tried my plant light instead and it actually helped.

Here’s the context:

* **What happened**: On Monday I accidentally drank a turmeric wellness shot while wearing my Invisalign. 🤦‍♀️
* **How long it sat**: A few days (not ideal). Plus, I regularly drink coffee with them in, so I wasn’t expecting a full reset.
* **What I tried**: I brush them regularly with unscented foam soap and soaked them in denture cleaner since it happened with no change. Today, I put my aligners in a glass with enough water to cover them for about 90 minutes under a plant light.
* **The result**: The yellow didn’t completely disappear, but it’s lighter. Enough of a difference that it feels worth sharing.

It’s not a miracle cure, but if you’re dealing with turmeric stains and sunlight isn’t an option, this might help. I suspect that if I did this quickly after the stain happened, it might have made more of a difference.

Share YOUR top picks! 👇✨","We've all been there. Mindlessly scrolling, thumb on autopilot, and then... **BAM**. Something stops you dead in your tracks.

It's not just another post. It's a question that hits differently, a poll that makes you reflect, or a simple ""drag and drop your worries here"" animation that actually makes you feel a little lighter. A genuine pattern-interrupt.

I saw one the other day that just asked, ""What's one thing you're proud of that you can't put on a resume?"" Man, that one sent me down a rabbit hole of thought for a solid 10 minutes. It was a simple question, but it re-centered my entire perspective on what ""achievement"" really means.

These aren't just distractions; they're micro-moments of growth. They're the digital equivalent of seeing a quote on a coffee shop wall that just *clicks*. It’s about that little jolt that makes you:

*   **PAUSE:** Breaking the cycle of endless consumption and just being present for a second.
*   **THINK:** A new perspective lands in your brain. You question a belief, see a problem differently, or have a small ""aha!"" moment about yourself.
*   **SMILE:** A genuine, unforced smile from something clever, wholesome, or deeply human that reminds you of the good stuff.

But let's be real, sometimes the internal dialogue these posts trigger can get heavy, and a single post isn't enough to navigate it all. For anyone needing a more structured way to process those bigger thoughts and feelings, I've found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for providing genuine emotional support.

1nqe5ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nqe5ci/hm_hair_today_gone_tomorrow_the_onion_years/,"[HM] Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow: The Onion Years","\[HM\] An excerpt from my story I published this week

I used to be a man with hair. Not just any hair, mind you, but what I considered to be a **magnificent, deity-level crown** of brown waves that shimmered like chocolate silk under Port Alberni’s four minutes of annual sunshine. At least, that’s what I told myself every morning in our tiny bathroom mirror while Susan yelled through the door that I was fogging it up again.

The truth, as I’ve come to learn, is a slippery thing. Like trying to grab wet soap while blindfolded, or trying to cling to the last few strands of a dying follicular civilization.

It all began on a Tuesday in March 2003, which already feels like the kind of date baldness would choose for an ambush. I was getting ready for my shift at the mill, humming the *Hockey Night in Canada* theme, running my fingers through what I still believed to be my Samson-level locks, when I felt it. Or rather… didn’t feel it.

Where there should’ve been a soft thicket of virile man-mane, there was just **skin**. Smooth. Pale. Betraying me like Judas in a shampoo aisle.

I froze. Boxer shorts. Work socks. One hand suspended in horror on the back of my head. I looked into the mirror like I was discovering a new continent, except this one was bald, shiny, and utterly treacherous.

“SUSAN!” I hollered, summoning her like a man whose house was on fire, except the fire was emotional and located on the top of his head.

She appeared with her coffee mug, wearing that face wives get when their husbands are being dramatic again. “What now, Dave?”

I pointed at my scalp like it was evidence in a murder trial. “Look at this! It’s gone! Vanished! My hairline has officially surrendered.”

She squinted, took a casual sip of her coffee, and said, “You’re going bald. So?”

*So?* *SO?!* That’s like telling someone who just lost their eyebrows in a freak barbecue accident to “just shake it off.”

“This is temporary,” I muttered. “Probably stress. Or maybe it's the new mill management. Or maybe the pillowcase is... I don't know... too abrasive?”

Susan gave me *The Smile*. You know the one. The “I love you, but you are a deeply confused man” smile. The one she uses when we’re driving and I tell her I’m not lost, even though I’m clearly in a different postal code.

Over the next few weeks, I became a full-time scalp cartographer. I studied every angle using a hand mirror and two camping flashlights. I counted hairs like a dragon counting coins. I bought shampoos with mystical promises, *Volumize! Rejuvenate! Awaken the sleeping follicles of destiny!* Nothing worked. The bald spot didn’t retreat. It expanded like it had just received a tax break and a permit from city council.

# The Descent Into Hair Loss Madness

This is where I should’ve accepted it, where I should’ve embraced the natural flow of aging with grace and maturity.

Instead, I went full mad scientist.

First, I bought a bottle of ""All-Natural Hair Regrow"" oil from the farmer’s market. The label claimed it was made from “ancient Himalayan root extract” and “blessed by monks.” It smelled like expired pickles and barn wood. I applied it nightly while chanting “grow, baby, grow” like I was coaxing a Chia Pet.

Then I tried standing on my head for ten minutes a day. The internet said “increased scalp circulation” was the key. All it gave me was a herniated feeling in my left eye and a reputation at the mill for being “that guy who’s training for the upside-down Olympics.”

Susan caught me massaging onion juice into my scalp one night. I’d read somewhere that raw onion juice stimulates hair growth. She walked into the bathroom, took one look at me rubbing my head like I was marinating it, and said, “If the house starts smelling like soup stock, you're sleeping in the shed.”

Feedback is always appreciated.

1nqe4f5,https://i.redd.it/aiunjln6qcrf1.png,Midnight Collission | The smell of stale alcohol clung to the peeling wallpaper of the tiny living room,"Chapter One: Fractured Glass

The smell of stale alcohol clung to the peeling wallpaper of the tiny living room. Empty bottles were scattered across the table, and cigarette smoke lingered in the stagnant air. Morning light filtered weakly through dusty curtains, painting faded shapes on the cracked floor tiles.

Seraphina Lane—Sera to the few who cared to know her—moved silently through the room, careful not to let the loose floorboards creak beneath her sneakers. Her backpack was slung over one shoulder, and she clutched her laptop close to her chest, her lifeline in a world perpetually on the verge of collapse

A guttural voice broke the silence.

“Where do you think you’re going so early?”

Her father was slouched on the recliner, a bottle hanging limply from his hand. His bloodshot eyes squinted at her, barely able to focus. The bruises on her wrist throbbed under the sleeves of her oversized hoodie.

“To class, Dad,” she said softly, avoiding his gaze. “It’s Monday.”

“College…” he slurred, lips curling into something cruel. “Think you’re better than me because you’re some big-shot genius, huh?”



Sera stayed silent. She had learned long ago that words only fed his anger.







“Come here.”







Her stomach tightened. “I’m going to be late.”







But he was already rising from his chair, staggering forward. In two steps, he grabbed her arm. The pain shot up to her shoulder, and she winced.







“Ungrateful brat,” he spat, his grip tightening. “All these years, all the sacrifices I made—”







“Let go!” she snapped, pulling away. Her voice trembled, and her heart pounded in her chest.







For a second, he seemed frozen, his drunken mind processing her defiance. Then his hand came down. Fast. Hard.







The sting spread across her cheek, and her vision blurred. But Sera didn’t cry. Not anymore.







Satisfied, he released her, stumbling backward into his chair and mumbling something incoherent.







With shaking hands, she adjusted her hood over her head, picked up her backpack, and left the apartment without another word.







The air outside was sharp and cold, biting against her flushed skin. Sera kept her head down as she walked briskly through the streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts, toward the MIT campus. She passed crowds of students laughing, carrying coffee cups, and discussing assignments. They lived in a world she could barely touch—a world of safety, warmth, and certainty.







By the time she reached the lecture hall, her cheek had begun to swell. She pulled her hood lower, letting her auburn hair fall forward to cover the mark.







Inside, Professor Alden was already scribbling equations on the board. His sharp eyes caught sight of her as she slipped into her seat at the back of the room.







After class, as students shuffled out, Alden approached her. He was a wiry man in his late fifties with a no-nonsense demeanor.







“Sera,” he said softly. “Stay behind for a moment.”







She froze but nodded.







When the room was empty, he spoke again. “Rough morning?”







She hesitated before nodding once.







“You know the lab is always open to you,” he said gently. “No one will bother you there.”







“Thank you, Professor,” she whispered, clutching her backpack tighter.







The lab was her sanctuary. Rows of high-end computers and half-assembled machinery filled the space. The hum of processors and the faint scent of burnt metal greeted her as she sat down at her usual station.







Here, she wasn’t Sera Lane, the girl with the bruises. Here, she was Seraphina, the genius programmer.







Lines of code danced across her screen as she worked on her latest project—a software optimization program for high-performance vehicles. It was sleek, efficient, and light-years ahead of anything currently available on the market.







She was in the zone, fingers flying over the keyboard, when her phone buzzed beside her.







Theo Grant.







Her stomach did a little flip.







Theo had been her classmate in high school—once the smart kid with a rebellious streak, now the kingpin of Cambridge’s underground racing scene.







She hesitated before answering.







“Hey, Theo.”







“Hey, Sera. Long time, huh?” His voice was smooth, with an edge of mischief.







“What do you need?”







Theo chuckled. “Straight to the point, I see. Look, it’s about your program. The one you’ve been fine-tuning. I have a client who’s willing to pay big for it.”







“It’s not ready for sale yet,” she said firmly.







“That’s the thing—it doesn’t need to be sold. Just installed. But it has to be you doing it. Client’s orders.”







Sera frowned. “Why me?”







“Because no one else knows how to handle your code like you do, genius girl.”







She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Theo… I don’t want to get involved with your world. I’m trying to build a life—a real life.”







“I know, Sera,” he said, his voice softer now. “But listen, this isn’t just about money. This is an opportunity. Come to the race tonight. Install the program. Get your cash. And then you can walk away.”







“How much?”







“Enough to get out of that hellhole you call home.”







Sera’s breath hitched.







“Where’s the race?”







“The old airstrip. Midnight. Wear something warm—it’s gonna be a long night.”







The call ended, leaving her staring at her phone.







Hours later, back in her cramped bedroom, Sera stared at the small wad of cash she had managed to save. It wasn’t enough—not yet.







Her father was passed out in the living room again. Empty bottles littered the floor.







She closed her eyes, clutching her laptop bag.







The choice wasn’t really a choice at all.







She couldn’t stay here.







The night was alive with roaring engines, screeching tires, and the distant crackle of loudspeakers. Bright headlights sliced through the darkness as cars lined up on the old airstrip. The crowd was electric—drunk on speed and adrenaline.







Theo spotted her almost immediately. He was leaning casually against a sleek black sports car, arms crossed over his chest.







“Sera!” he called, grinning. “You made it.”







She walked over, pulling her hoodie tighter.







“This better be worth it, Theo.”







“Oh, it will be.” He gestured to a matte black car parked a few feet away. “That’s the beast you’ll be working on tonight.”







But before she could respond, a ripple moved through the crowd. Whispers. Nervous glances.







Then, a man stepped into view.







He was tall, broad-shouldered, and moved with the quiet confidence of a predator. His sharp jawline and piercing eyes made the air feel colder. He was dressed in all black—leather jacket, fitted pants, boots that crunched against the gravel.







Sera’s breath caught in her throat.







Theo leaned closer to her ear.







“That’s him. Damon Hale.”







The name felt like a gunshot in the night.







And as Damon’s gaze locked onto her, Sera felt something shift deep inside her chest—something dangerous, something inevitable.







Chapter 2 - Work for me





\*\*Seraphina\*\*







The garage smelled of oil, burnt rubber, and cold metal—a sharp contrast to the crisp air of the midnight sky outside. The hum of high-powered engines and the faint cheers from the racecourse echoed through the cavernous space. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting shadows over the sleek, matte-black car parked in the center of the garage—Damon Hale's prized machine.







Sera’s laptop was balanced carefully on the hood of the car as she typed furiously, her fingers flying over the keys. The custom software was almost installed, every sequence running flawlessly. Her hoodie sleeves were pushed up just enough to reveal faint bruises on her wrists.







She glanced over her shoulder; the garage was empty except for her. Theo had promised her that no one would bother her while she worked, but promises in this world were as brittle as glass.







“Focus, Sera,” she muttered to herself, plugging in the final cable to the car's central console.







The moment was interrupted by heavy footsteps echoing across the concrete floor.







“Well, well… what do we have here?”







The voice was oily, laced with mockery. Sera froze momentarily before turning slowly to face the intruder. A man in his late twenties, wearing a leather jacket with an unfamiliar logo, leaned casually against a toolbox. His smile was crooked, predatory. He was one of Damon’s rivals—she recognized the logo from the track.







“Garage is off-limits,” she said firmly, keeping her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands.







He chuckled, pushing off the toolbox and stepping closer. “Relax, sweetheart. I’m just curious about what a pretty little genius like you is doing under Damon Hale’s hood.”







She took a step back. “I’m working. You’re not supposed to be here.”







His grin widened. “Oh, but I am. And it looks like we’ve got a little privacy.”







The moment he lunged toward her, Sera ducked to the side, knocking over a metal stool in the process. Her laptop nearly slid off the car hood, but she caught it just in time.







“Don’t touch me!” she snapped, backing away.







Before the man could close the gap again, another voice cut through the tension—sharp, low, and laced with barely restrained violence.







“I wouldn’t take another step if I were you.”







The man froze mid-stride, his face paling. Damon Hale stood at the entrance of the garage, his broad shoulders framed by the light from the racetrack outside. His expression was unreadable, but the storm brewing in his steel-gray eyes was unmistakable.







The rival driver raised his hands in mock surrender. “Hey, easy, Damon. We’re just chatting.”







Damon stepped forward, his boots echoing with each step. “Get. Out.”







The man hesitated, but Damon’s next step was enough to send him scrambling towards the exit.







Once the intruder was gone, Damon turned his gaze on Sera. His sharp eyes scanned her from head to toe, lingering on the faint bruise along her jaw and the ones on her wrist. His jaw clenched.







“How long have you been alone in here?” he asked, his voice low.







“I—I was just finishing up. I didn’t expect anyone to—”







He stepped closer, and for a moment, Sera felt like she was being assessed by a predator. But there was something else in his eyes—concern.







“Those bruises aren’t fresh,” he said softly.







Sera flinched slightly, pulling her sleeves down. “It’s nothing.”







His expression darkened. “Nothing doesn’t leave marks like that.”







For a moment, the garage was silent except for the faint hum of the car’s engine systems coming online. Damon’s eyes held hers, and Sera felt an inexplicable pull, like gravity itself was tethering her to him.







“Is the software ready?” he asked finally, breaking the silence.







She swallowed and nodded. “Yes. It’s installed. You can test it now.”







Damon’s lips twitched into something that might have been a smile, if only for a second. “Good. Get in. You’re coming with me.”







“What? Where?”







“We’re testing it. And you’ll want to be there.”







\*\*Damon\*\*







Damon’s knuckles were still tight around the steering wheel as he tore down the empty back roads outside the racetrack. Sera sat stiffly in the passenger seat, clutching her laptop bag as if it were a lifeline.







She had fire, he’d give her that. Fear simmered behind her green eyes, but it was eclipsed by determination. The bruises on her wrists and jaw gnawed at him, sparking a rage he rarely felt. Someone had hurt her, and judging by the faded purple hue of the bruises, it wasn’t recent.







They arrived at his firm—an industrial fortress of glass and steel. Damon parked the car, the engine growling low as it cooled.







“Come with me,” he said curtly, stepping out.







Inside, the lights illuminated a pristine workspace—one half filled with luxury cars in various states of assembly, the other with advanced software labs and high-tech equipment.







“This is your domain now,” he said, turning to face her. “You’ll have access to everything here. No limitations, no restrictions.”







Sera’s brows furrowed. “You want me to work here?”







“Yes.”







“Why?”







Damon crossed his arms. “Your software is good, but it’s not what I need. I don’t just want optimization—I want dominance. And for that, I need you.”







Sera hesitated. “And if I say no?”







“You’ll walk away with more money than you’ve ever had,” Damon replied honestly. “But I have a feeling that’s not what you want.”







Her phone buzzed, breaking the moment. Sera froze, her face paling.







She hesitated before answering.







“Dad, I’m busy. Please—”







His voice was sharp, angry. “Where’s the money, Seraphina? You’ve been hiding it, haven’t you?”







“Dad, please, I’ll—”







“Get home. Now.”







The call disconnected.







Damon’s voice broke through the silence. “That was him, wasn’t it?”







Sera couldn’t meet his eyes.







“Work for me, Seraphina,” Damon said, his voice low. “You’ll have security. Independence. You won’t have to go back there.”







“I—I need time to think,” she whispered.







Chapter 3 - Where are you?





\*\*Seraphina\*\*







The door creaked as Sera stepped into the darkened apartment. The familiar stench of alcohol and stale cigarettes clung to the air like a suffocating blanket. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack as she cautiously moved through the mess. Broken glass glittered faintly under the dim kitchen light, and her father’s shadow loomed over the worn armchair in the corner.







He was awake.







“Where the hell have you been?” his voice rasped, sharp as broken glass.







Sera swallowed hard. “At work. I told you I had an important job tonight.”







“Work,” he sneered, pushing himself to his feet. The bottle in his hand sloshed with amber liquid. His eyes, bloodshot and wild, locked onto her like a predator. “Don’t lie to me, girl. You think I don’t know what you’ve been up to? Who you’ve been with?”







She took a step back, her breath catching in her throat. “I’m not lying. I’m trying to build something for myself—for us. So we don’t have to live like this anymore.”







“For us?” He laughed bitterly. “You think you’re better than me because you’ve got your fancy school and your big dreams? You’re nothing, Seraphina. Nothing without me.”







She flinched as he spat her name, her nails digging into her palm. “Why are you like this? You weren’t always like this…”

The other layers I think I can manage from stuff around my home, just clippings and yard debris. Maybe even some compostable stuff from veggies and whatnot, coffee grounds, just to be creative.

I’m also 5 months postpartum so I thought the fatigue and severe exhaustion was normal but I went to urgent care when I figured out with google that it’s possibly my thyroid. Lo and behold, my TSH came back 49 and the next day they told me to go to the ER right away.  They did a sonogram and said it was enlarged and reran my TSH which was now 57 (one day later). T3 and T3”4 were also low. They sent me home with a Hashimotos hypothyroidism diagnosis and a Levo 100mg daily prescription and they said I’ve likely had Hashimotos for years and this pregnancy might’ve caused a big flare up.

I had all 4 removed, all impacted, all stitched, IV sedated. I’m now on day 16. A little timeline of my progression of eating, just to help other people with their recovery.

Days 1-4: basically nothing. As soft and liquid as possible. Mashed potatoes, yogurt, milkshakes, cream of wheat, absolutely nothing with chunks. If you are like me and can’t open your mouth, lick the food off a spoon.
Day 5: overcooked crushed up ramen, scrambled eggs
Day 6: first solid thing ate, a grilled cheese that was one piece of white bread folded in half, barely toasted. I put two slices of turkey breast in it for some protein
Day 7: mildly overcooked hamburger helper
Day 8: breadsticks from little ceasers with a bunch of sauce to soften them up more 
Day 9: proper pho from a restaurant with no spicy at all, some of my friends potato wedges 
Day 10: scrambled eggs with ham and sausage, soup dumplings, tiramisu, and biscuits and gravy
Day 11: some spiced ramen with soft boiled eggs
Day 12: McDonald’s nuggets
Day 13: enchiladas
Day 14: homemade quesadillas with peppers, onions, and grilled chicken
Day 15: sushi!
Day 16 (today): Taco Bell breakfast and I’m having burgers for dinner

How I judged it is once the stiffness in my jaw went away I started eating more solid foods gradually. DO NOT chew with your back teeth, chew with your front teeth, it looks stupid but it works. If your surgeon gave you a syringe, use it starting day 5. I was scared at first but man it works. If not, buy a curved tip irrigation syringe and spray out the holes after eating. Kinda uncomfy, but if you use warm water on the more cool side it relieves the ache from eating! Rinse each hole more then once, you’d be surprised how much gets stuck in there.

Straws! My surgeon doesn’t want me drinking from straws until day 21 so that’s how long I’m waiting. My surgeon also released me to drink coffee and soda on day 7. Citrus is a no until day 21 as well.

Smoking! I vape and smoke tree. If you just don’t close your mouth around the vape and breathe in your vape will hit. It is a direct lung hit and will feel kinda weird initially but it is the “safest” way I know of. For tree, grab some edibles or have your partner shotgun you hits. Always make sure to rinse your mouth well after! I started vaping 2-3 hours after surgery, and smoked the next morning for the pain.

Before this, I used a regular Nespresso capsule machine. I’ve followed all the setup instructions, and so far I’m really happy with the intuitiv system. I had already watched a lot of YouTube videos before buying, and that’s what helped me make my decision.

So far, I’ve brewed a couple of regular coffees, playing around with the settings, since that’s what I usually drink. I’ll try the milk functions later, since I’m not much of a milk drinker myself.

However, I do have two questions:

1. **Cup sizes** Does anyone know the exact volume (in centiliters/ounces) of the *small*, *medium*, *large*, and *extra large* settings? I still have a lot of Nespresso Pixie double-walled cups. They’re great, but they’re too small for *small* and too big for *medium*. Is there a way to customize the size of those settings? How do I know if the cup/glass I'm going to use will be big enough for the drink I'm choosing?
2. **Coffee too weak** Even when I adjust the intensity for espresso or coffee, I still find the result too weak. Compared to my old Nespresso capsule machine, the coffee tastes much less strong. If I literally hold the cup against the light, I can almost see through it — which was never the case before. Does anyone here have experience with this? How can I make the coffee stronger? Should I adjust the grind size (finer or coarser)? Or should I try to use more/less ground coffee somehow?

For the past 8 years, she has been on a steady decline, with now being an all time low. When she was 19, she was diagnosed with cancer. Before her diagnosis, she was a healthy, incredibly driven and smart girl who had goals to go to medical school. After her cancer (she was cured) she started to change. 

It started small, her having brain fog from chemo made it incredibly difficult for her to finish her biology degree, and she lost interest in medicine. Understandable. She then decided she didn’t want anything to do with biology, and she wanted to get a math degree instead to be an actuary. This is when things started getting worse. She began to gain weight, not a lot at first, but it slowly started. I believe lot of it has to do with my mom, she is overweight herself, but she is INCREDIBLY critical of me and my sister (not my brother). For example, she told me I would stop gaining weight after 15, which made me incredibly embarrassed to ask for new clothes when I grew out of them. She also will hide any junk food in the house from us. No naturally, my sister started hoarding food in her room and I believe she probably binged. 

My sister started making poor financial decisions. She moved away for school and decided to buy a huge apartment and a dog she couldn’t afford. She also dropped out of school (which I only found out years later) then she returned, putting herself behind. She began dating awful men who mistreated her and had no life and no goals. Her last boyfriend was a disrespectful rude man who did drugs and got her into w*ed. Where I live, weed is legal, and I know it’s not necessary a bad thing, but she does it very often just to get through the day.

Her diet has become horrendous. She drinks a “coffee” every morning, I say “coffee” because it’s half coffee, half cream, with 5 heaping tablespoons of sugar. She doesn’t eat vegetables, barely any fruit, and tons and tons of carbs. Her room is littered with empty containers of ramen, ice cream, chip bags, and chocolate bars, which she attempts to hide in the corner. She has terrible self esteem, will only wear pyjamas, and only gets dressed to leave the house. She will start keto (a no carb high fat diet) for a week then quit, which makes you gain MORE weight because if you do keto you need to stick to it for a while to see results, 1 week of only fat with make you gain weight.

Right now, she lives back at home and is at an all time low. She is about 55 pounds overweight, has 5k of credit card debt, doesn’t know when she will finish her degree, destroying herself with horrible men, and she lays down 24/7, and is severely depressed because she hates her life.

The whole thing is she has an absolute MELTDOWN when you mention anything to her. If you offer her any advice, or point out anything about her life (even in the most gentle way possible) she begins to scream and cry while cursing you out. She acts like she doesn’t know how to help herself. She has been in and out of therapy, and she is on depression/anxiety, and ADHD meds and birth control. I am worried sick for her, and every day she destroys herself more and more. She will complain to me about how she hates herself, but if I try to tell her to change her lifestyle she goes apeshit.

Currently I am a Program Coordinator making a little under $50,000 and my commute is about 15 minutes each way (7 miles each way). I have always been told a government job is best because of the retirement benefits and flexibility and insurance which is why I didn't really look into outside jobs out of public higher education.

I was recommended for a job outside of higher education but it is an Executive Assistant/Specialist position to the CEO of the company and the salary range is exponential, $55,000-$90,000. I got my first interview and waiting to hear back for a second. I am torn. I did not apply for the job right away when they asked me to last year because of the drive. The new job would be about 45min-1hour away each way (depending on traffic) and about 42 miles each way. I don't know what to do. I was told insurance would be like $20 a month and the company will match 100% of the first 6% contributed after being vested (5 years). One thing that is iffy to me is during my interview, they asked good questions but then they all of sudden asked if I was okay serving coffee/tea to the CEO and his VIP guests about once a day when they have meetings. Yes and no... so the more I think about it, I honestly am not sure how I feel about that so that is one thing that is deterring me from doing the job but I feel like there would be other career skills I would learn that would override that part of the job. 

The reason I did end up applying is because after talking to some people that I value and are important people in my life, they said it might be a good experience to try something new being the age I am and without any ""responsibilities"" of a family like children just yet. Plus, being the executive for the CEO would provide different learning experiences, whether good or bad. I do plan on getting married in about two years and having children in about 3-4 years so my partner did mention he doesn't expect me going back to work/the job with it being that far. He makes a lot more than me so we would be comfortable if I didn't' go back to work, but until then, my mindset is trying something new outside of higher education but also I am scared. 

I am waiting on their salary offer but my friend who works there currently said I could possibly negotiate to $75,000. IF that were to happen, what should I do? I would love your opinions and experiences. Topics like benefits, retirement, commute, job experience, should I make the left of a career change, etc.

1nqdwfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BayAreaHomes/comments/1nqdwfl/dutch_bros_plans_new_san_jose_site_at_empty/,Dutch Bros plans new San Jose site at empty restaurant property,"The recent announcement that Dutch Bros Coffee plans to establish a new location in San Jose, specifically at an empty restaurant site, offers intriguing implications for the local real estate market and broader economic landscape. As one of the fastest-growing coffee chains in the United States, Dutch Bros' expansion into the Bay Area signifies not just a shift in consumer preferences but also potential changes in local property dynamics and community development.

The choice of a previously occupied restaurant space reflects a strategic move that aligns with current urban redevelopment trends. As cities like San Jose continue to grapple with evolving consumer habits—especially post-pandemic—there is a marked shift towards drive-through services and convenience-oriented retail. This trend is particularly relevant in a densely populated region like the Bay Area, where residents increasingly seek quick and efficient service due to time constraints and commuter lifestyles. The repurposing of vacant commercial properties not only enhances the area's aesthetic appeal but also signals a commitment to revitalizing local economies.

For residents, the arrival of Dutch Bros can be viewed as a positive development. It represents the diversification of services available to the community, enriching the local dining and retail landscape. As residents become more accustomed to a variety of coffee options, including specialty brews, the influx of chains like Dutch Bros can elevate the overall consumer experience in San Jose. This can foster community engagement, as coffee shops often serve as social hubs. Moreover, increased foot traffic in the area can benefit neighboring businesses, creating a ripple effect that enhances local economic vitality.

From an investor's perspective, the establishment of new retail outlets like Dutch Bros can signal a favorable climate for property investment. The Bay Area, known for its high demand for both residential and commercial real estate, may see a rise in property values surrounding the new location. Investors may begin to consider the potential increase in foot traffic and local business synergy, which can directly influence residential property desirability in the vicinity. As businesses flourish, so too do housing markets, particularly in areas where job growth and consumer spending are on the rise.

Additionally, this development can be seen as part of a larger narrative regarding the shifting landscape of commercial real estate throughout the Bay Area. As several sectors adapt to post-COVID realities, the demand for mixed-use developments that incorporate both residential and commercial elements is likely to increase. This kind of integrated approach not only supports local economies but also addresses housing shortages by creating multi-functional spaces that cater to various needs.

The implications extend beyond immediate economic benefits. The growing presence of retail chains can also influence housing policy and development strategies in San Jose and beyond. As local governments recognize the need to support economic growth through infrastructure and zoning policies, we may see a push for more comprehensive planning that balances residential needs with commercial expansion. This could involve incentivizing developers to construct mixed-use properties that incorporate living spaces above retail venues, thus promoting a more walkable, vibrant community.

In conclusion, Dutch Bros’ entry into San Jose is not merely a localized event but reflects broader trends in real estate and community development within the Bay Area. For residents, it enhances neighborhood amenities and fosters social interaction. For investors, it offers potential opportunities in a dynamic market. As the Bay Area continues to evolve, developments like this highlight the importance of adapting to changing consumer behaviors while balancing the need for sustainable growth in housing and commercial sectors. As we move forward, monitoring these trends will be crucial for all stakeholders in the Bay Area real estate landscape.

Ever since the wedding, it feels like she’s completely disappeared from my life. Before she got married, we were close. She’d call a few times a week, visit regularly, and we’d always catch up over lunch or coffee. I genuinely thought we had a strong bond.

But since she tied the knot, everything changed. She rarely calls unless I reach out first, and even then it’s usually short and rushed. As for visiting? I honestly can’t remember the last time she came by. I’ve been to her place a few times (after asking if it was okay), but she never makes the effort to come see me. She only lives about 30–40 minutes away, so it’s not a huge distance issue.

I’ve brought it up gently a couple times, nothing accusatory, just something like, “Hey, I miss seeing you around. Maybe you can come by sometime?” She always says something like, “Yeah, soon!” But soon never happens.

Her husband is nice enough, but they seem very absorbed in their own little world. I’m trying not to take it personally, but it’s hard. I’m not demanding constant attention. I just miss my daughter. It feels like she moved on and left me behind.

For the past 8 years, she has been on a steady decline, with now being an all time low. When she was 19, she was diagnosed with cancer. Before her diagnosis, she was a healthy, incredibly driven and smart girl who had goals to go to medical school. After her cancer (she was cured) she started to change. 

It started small, her having brain fog from chemo made it incredibly difficult for her to finish her biology degree, and she lost interest in medicine. Understandable. She then decided she didn’t want anything to do with biology, and she wanted to get a math degree instead to be an actuary. This is when things started getting worse. She began to gain weight, not a lot at first, but it slowly started. I believe lot of it has to do with my mom, she is overweight herself, but she is INCREDIBLY critical of me and my sister (not my brother). For example, she told me I would stop gaining weight after 15, which made me incredibly embarrassed to ask for new clothes when I grew out of them. She also will hide any junk food in the house from us. No naturally, my sister started hoarding food in her room and I believe she probably binged. 

My sister started making poor financial decisions. She moved away for school and decided to buy a huge apartment and a dog she couldn’t afford. She also dropped out of school (which I only found out years later) then she returned, putting herself behind. She began dating awful men who mistreated her and had no life and no goals. Her last boyfriend was a disrespectful rude man who did drugs and got her into w*ed. Where I live, weed is legal, and I know it’s not necessary a bad thing, but she does it very often just to get through the day.

Her diet has become horrendous. She drinks a “coffee” every morning, I say “coffee” because it’s half coffee, half cream, with 5 heaping tablespoons of sugar. She doesn’t eat vegetables, barely any fruit, and tons and tons of carbs. Her room is littered with empty containers of ramen, ice cream, chip bags, and chocolate bars, which she attempts to hide in the corner. She has terrible self esteem, will only wear pyjamas, and only gets dressed to leave the house. She will start keto (a no carb high fat diet) for a week then quit, which makes you gain MORE weight because if you do keto you need to stick to it for a while to see results, 1 week of only fat with make you gain weight.

Right now, she lives back at home and is at an all time low. She is about 55 pounds overweight, has 5k of credit card debt, doesn’t know when she will finish her degree, destroying herself with horrible men, and she lays down 24/7, and is severely depressed because she hates her life.

The whole thing is she has an absolute MELTDOWN when you mention anything to her. If you offer her any advice, or point out anything about her life (even in the most gentle way possible) she begins to scream and cry while cursing you out. She acts like she doesn’t know how to help herself. She has been in and out of therapy, and she is on depression/anxiety, and ADHD meds and birth control. I am worried sick for her, and every day she destroys herself more and more. She will complain to me about how she hates herself, but if I try to tell her to change her lifestyle she goes apeshit.

1nqdu7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nqdu7g/tingling_right_arm_hand_leg_and_foot/,"Tingling right arm, hand, leg and foot","So at first I recently noticed this weird tingle in my right big toe and I genuinely thought maybe a spider or something bit me on the bottom of my toe that may have been in my shoe but there were no marks and no spider (I got home after exercise and checked).

A few days later my right leg is tingling and then I start noticing it on my right arm too. There is no pain except for at the very start when my toe started but now there’s no pain at all, no swelling, no marks or weird discolouration. I can still move my arm and leg when this is happening but it’s just this weird dull tingle.

A week later I see my doctor and we do regular blood work and she said all looked normal except for low iron so it has been 2 weeks and I’ve been working on that (I started drinking more coffee but have been having it at least an hour after the iron).

I notice this tingling is still coming and going and call me crazy but I notice it gets worse a few hours after certain foods like if I eat a burger or pizza it’s worse. Sometimes it can feel worse after exercise too.

For reference I’m in my early 30’s, female and I am a normal healthy weight. I’m also a mother to one child. I am under a lot of pressure and I usually use exercise to cope with the stress and the little sleep I get.

Of course I googled things I shouldn’t have and all sorts of things came up even though my doctor tells me I’m fine… I just don’t know and I’m actually really scared. ",1,1758823240.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

————————

Addison Murphy feigned sleep as her husband, Lincoln, rose from their bed and headed into the bathroom. She waited for only a minute after she heard the shower come on. She threw the covers back, jumped out of bed, stripped undressed, and hurried into the bathroom. She opened the door to the shower and sucked in her breath at the sight of her husband's undressed back. She reached up and ran her hands down his strong muscles and down to cup his hip.

""Morning,"" Link said, with his back still to her. He suddenly turned and backed her up against the wall. He leaned down and smooched her as he lifted her, and as soon as her legs wrapped around his waist, his engorged shaft sank into her.

""Mmm,"" Addy murmured against his lips. ""I missed you last night."" Several minutes later she sighed, and said softly, ""Lincoln, I love you so much.""

""Not as much as I love you,"" he said, and smooched her deeper. The next several minutes left them too busy for talking. Twenty minutes later, when the hot water began to cool, they quickly finished washing and stepped out. As they dried off and went back into the bedroom to dress, Link looked at his wife and smiled.

""Thank you for that."" He pointed at the bathroom.

""No problem. Never a hardship to have intercourse with my husband,"" she said as she dressed in a skirt and blouse. As she put on her heels she sighed as she looked over at him as he dressed in a pair of well-worn jeans and t-shirt. ""I wish I could go to work dressed like that.""

Link grinned at her. ""Come work for me and you can.""

""Like I know anything about engines."" She laughed as she finished her makeup. ""Oh, hey, don't forget I have that thing tonight.""

""Thing?""

""The Andersons' anniversary party.""

""Oh, so you won't be at the clubhouse?""

""Probably not. Then I have the Maddison wedding tomorrow,"" she said as she finished dressing, and together they went to the kitchen and Link started the coffee. Addy owned a party planning business and seemed to always have a thing. No matter how many times Lincoln listened to her, he could never grasp the concept of what she tried to tell him she did for a living. It took a few years to get her name out there, but in the last six months it seemed to take off.

Link owned the local garage and was a member of the local motorcycle club and he employed quite a few club members. ""So you won't be there tomorrow for the pig roast?""

""What time is it?""

""Starts around six at night. Tonight we're going over the last-minute details. So tonight's not really important for you to be there.""

""You sure? I could help with the planning.""

""Addy, you plan other people's parties every day of the week. The club doesn't expect you to plan ours,"" Link said as he handed her a cup of coffee. ""More importantly, I don't expect you to plan anything for the club. When you're there, I want you there to relax."" He didn't think his statement was harsh, but he frowned at her expression after he told her about not planning for the club.

""Oh,"" Addy said, and sighed. They had dated for two years, and had been married for five years now, and she still didn't feel like she was accepted by the other members of the club and their wives or girlfriends. Sure, she was friends with them, but she didn't feel accepted.

""What?""

""Nothing.""

""Addison?"" he asked sternly.

At his tone, she deflated. ""I'm sorry. I still don't feel accepted by the women at the club. We've been married for five years, dated two years before the wedding, that's seven years we've been together, and you've been in the club for eight. It's not that they slight me, or ignore me, but I don't feel accepted. I'm not trying to be whiny here, but that's how I feel whenever I'm at the clubhouse."" She paused and then walked up and hugged him tightly. ""That's what I love about you. You know when I'm feeling off or unsure. You get me. I love you for that, and the fact that we can talk about anything, no matter how busy our lives get.""

""I feel the same way, Addy. But I don't know what to tell you about the ladies in the club."" Link sighed as he hugged her, then took the plate of bacon and eggs she handed him. ""I know they always ask about you when you're not there, so do the guys. I know they like you.""

""Oh,"" she said as they ate their breakfast, then cleaned up the kitchen together. ""I'll be home late tonight. The anniversary party starts at six. Tomorrow the wedding starts at two. I might be able to get away around eight, nine at the latest.""

""Don't kill yourself to make it,"" Link said as he smooched the side of her head. ""I know you have your thing, I don't know exactly what it is, but I know it's for your job. If you make it, you make it, if not..."" He shrugged and then grabbed his leather jacket with his vest of colors and a couple minutes later Addy heard his Harley start up then leave.

Addy sighed as she finished up her coffee. ""How am I going to feel accepted if you don't care whether I show up or not?"" she asked the empty kitchen. She continued talking to the empty room. She had this habit of talking to herself to try to convince herself that she had the confidence to do something when her gut screamed that she couldn't do it. ""You're a good person, Addy. Just show up and start talking to them. They'll eventually accept you. You got this. I'm your husband, I'll be there to support you."" She snorted and actually jumped when her phone rang, then as she answered, she put her personal phobias away and got down to business.

Several hours later, Link walked into the clubhouse, and the first thing he did was go to the bar and get a beer. He'd had a hard day at work, the parts he'd been promised hadn't arrived, and he spent several hours on the phone trying to track them down. That put his project back a couple days and the customer was calling, demanding his car back.

""Link."" Mary, the president's wife who was tending bar, acknowledged him. ""Addy with you?""

""No, she had a thing,"" he said, and studied the woman's face and saw disapproval in her expression. He noted that she didn't ask what kind of thing. As he studied the other woman, he realized that whenever Lincoln would tell anyone at the clubhouse that Addy had a thing, they never, ever questioned him on what it was. He wondered if his wife might not be as paranoid as he thought she was.

""You sure?"" came a voice from his side, and he looked over and saw Stephanie standing there. The chick had tried to get in his pants on several occasions, but Link was happily married and wasn't interested. She was one of the women that hung around and slept with any single patch holder that crooked their finger. Not his style.

""Don't start trouble, Steph."" Mary frowned at her.

""It's just that I saw his wife meet several men at the hotel downtown in the last couple of weeks. Seems funny that she has time to spend all day in a hotel with other men and Link works hard all day.""

Link actually laughed. ""Probably her clients. And believe me, she makes more money than I do. If it wasn't for her job, my shop would have closed down a long time ago.""

""What type of clients?"" Steph asked as she saddled up to him and rubbed her breasts against his arm and he immediately stepped away. ""You must be a strong man to allow your wife to meet strange men in a hotel all day every day."" He didn't like what she was implying and scowled hard at her.

""Yep. And you know why? Because I know she comes home to me every night,"" he said, and stepped away from her. He looked at Mary and rolled his eyes. ""Your old man around?""

""Out back with the pig cooker.""

Link grabbed his beer and left them. Steph sat down and sighed. ""Why doesn't he see that his wife's cheating on him? If I was married to him, I'd scratch anyone's eyes out for just looking at him. Someone has to have him take his blinders off when it comes to that woman. Bet her clients are there for intercourse.""

""Stephanie Gibson!"" Mary said sternly. ""Watch your tongue, if Lincoln hears you talk about his wife like that, he'd ban you from the clubhouse.""



...

Two hours later, Addy parked her car at the clubhouse and took several deep breaths. She wore jeans, high heeled boots, a camisole and her club vest that announced her property of Abe. Her husband's club name. She entered and saw that Greaser, her husband's best friend and business partner was behind the bar. She walked up and smiled, relieved that at least he accepted her for who she was and always welcomed her when she was at the clubhouse. ""Hey, Greaser, can I have a beer?""

""Addy!"" He actually yelled her name, loudly. ""What are you doing here?""

Addy felt instantly like she didn't belong, or wasn't wanted. For the first time since meeting him years ago, she felt unwanted, and didn't realize how hurt it made her feel. But she took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""I told Link I'd meet him here around eight. I'm a little late."" She saw it was almost eight thirty by the clock behind the bar. ""But I made it.""

""Ah, um good,"" he said and handed her a beer. Not sure he should say anything, he said, ""Abe's out back."" And nodded to the back door that led to a patio.

""Thanks, I'll go tell him I'm here."" She picked up her beer, turned and waved to several people. ""I'll be right back."" She called to the room at large. ""I want to tell Link I'm here."" She didn't understand the shocked expressions on almost everyone's faces, but she wanted to see her husband. She went out to look for him and heard his voice over in the corner. The sight before her shocked her so much the beer bottle fell out of her hands. He was lying on a lounge chair and his pants were open and a woman's head was moving up and down on him. They didn't hear her because the woman was moaning loudly.

Shocked, Addy stood there and could only stare, Greaser and Burt, the club president tried to drag her away, but she shrugged their hands off. She only saw red, she walked up to the couple grabbed the woman by the hair on the back of her head and ripped her away from him. She didn't care that her husband's shaft was flaccid. ""Don't bother coming home,"" she said, and turned on her heel to turn away from the sight of her husband having intercourse with another woman.

""Let go of me, you bimbo! Who are you?""

Addy glared at the woman she still held, and in her anger, she pulled her arm back and hauled off and hit the woman in the mouth. She didn't hold back, and didn't care that the other woman actually had a bloody nose. She tossed the woman away from her like she was trash, and said, ""His wife, soon to be ex-wife.""

1nqdsil,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1nqdsil/how_do_i_help_my_sister/,How do I help my sister,"I (19F) have an older (27 year old) sister. For the past 8 years, she has been on a steady decline, with now being an all time low. When she was 19, she was diagnosed with cancer. Before her diagnosis, she was a healthy, incredibly driven and smart girl who had goals to go to medical school. After her cancer (she was cured) she started to change. 

It started small, her having brain fog from chemo made it incredibly difficult for her to finish her biology degree, and she lost interest in medicine. Understandable. She then decided she didn’t want anything to do with biology, and she wanted to get a math degree instead to be an actuary. This is when things started getting worse. She began to gain weight, not a lot at first, but it slowly started. I believe lot of it has to do with my mom, she is overweight herself, but she is INCREDIBLY critical of me and my sister (not my brother). For example, she told me I would stop gaining weight after 15, which made me incredibly embarrassed to ask for new clothes when I grew out of them. She also will hide any junk food in the house from us. No naturally, my sister started hoarding food in her room and I believe she probably binged. 

My sister started making poor financial decisions. She moved away for school and decided to buy a huge apartment and a dog she couldn’t afford. She also dropped out of school (which I only found out years later) then she returned, putting herself behind. She began dating awful men who mistreated her and had no life and no goals. Her last boyfriend was a disrespectful rude man who did drugs and got her into w*ed. Where I live, weed is legal, and I know it’s not necessary a bad thing, but she does it very often just to get through the day.

Her diet has become horrendous. She drinks a “coffee” every morning, I say “coffee” because it’s half coffee, half cream, with 5 heaping tablespoons of sugar. She doesn’t eat vegetables, barely any fruit, and tons and tons of carbs. Her room is littered with empty containers of ramen, ice cream, chip bags, and chocolate bars, which she attempts to hide in the corner. She has terrible self esteem, will only wear pyjamas, and only gets dressed to leave the house. She will start keto (a no carb high fat diet) for a week then quit, which makes you gain MORE weight because if you do keto you need to stick to it for a while to see results, 1 week of only fat with make you gain weight.

Right now, she lives back at home and is at an all time low. She is about 55 pounds overweight, has 5k of credit card debt, doesn’t know when she will finish her degree, destroying herself with horrible men, and she lays down 24/7, and is severely depressed because she hates her life.

The whole thing is she has an absolute MELTDOWN when you mention anything to her. If you offer her any advice, or point out anything about her life (even in the most gentle way possible) she begins to scream and cry while cursing you out. She acts like she doesn’t know how to help herself. She has been in and out of therapy, and she is on depression/anxiety, and ADHD meds and birth control. I am worried sick for her, and every day she destroys herself more and more. She will complain to me about how she hates herself, but if I try to tell her to change her lifestyle she goes apeshit. I refuse to sit back and watch her kill herself. My parents are as useful as a toothpick and have given up on her. What to I do",1,1758823132.0,venting,1,1.0,False

On October 5th I’ll be running my very first half marathon in Cardiff 🏃‍♂️. I’m doing it for Big Moose, a small but powerful charity that helped me when I was at my lowest. After a mental breakdown 3 years ago, they gave me the support I desperately needed when I couldn’t open up to anyone else. Without them, I don’t know where I’d be.

Now I want to give back. Big Moose funds therapy for people who are struggling with their mental health but can’t afford treatment. £500 covers life-changing support for one person. My target is £500 — I’ve raised £220 so far — and I’d love to reach that goal before race day. 

If anyone could spare even the price of a coffee, it would mean the world to me — and even more to someone whos having a tough time

Thank you so much for reading my first post, and for any support ❤️

1nqdrfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1nqdrfs/explore_if_the_best_water_filter_pitcher/,Explore if the Best Water Filter Pitcher ZeroWater ZD-012RP Delivers,"Testing out the ZeroWater ZD-012RP has been an interesting journey, especially given how much water my household goes through daily. It’s easy to overlook just how significant water filtration is until you taste the difference. The ZeroWater 12-Cup 5-Stage Water Filter Pitcher promises purified water free of dissolved solids, and as someone who’s skeptical of lofty product claims, I had to put it to the test.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This pitcher doesn’t just look clean; it feels sturdy in your hands. The ergonomic handle is comfortable to use, even when the pitcher is full, and the compact design fits easily in my crowded fridge. It weighs only 1 pound, which is impressive given its 12-cup capacity. The quick-fill spigot is another convenience that I genuinely appreciate. I’ve used it for filling my glass without the hassle of tipping the entire jug. However, the curved handle could be a bit tricky for younger or arthritic hands, as one of my coworkers mentioned when borrowing it for a weekend.

**Performance Features**  
The standout feature is clearly its advanced filtration system. The 5-stage ion exchange filter effectively removes a variety of contaminants for incredibly pure water. I used the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter included in the package to test my tap water before and after filtering. The results were astounding. My tap water’s TDS level was reduced to a flat zero after filtration. The attached meter is a game-changer—it’s easy to use, and I no longer have to guess if the filter needs changing. This scientific clarity made me trust the pitcher even more. Check [ZeroWater ZD-012RP price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b01ja5h7gk/)

**Pros**  
- Includes a TDS meter for accurate testing  
- Ergonomic and lightweight design  
- Certified to reduce lead, chromium, PFOA/PFOS, and other harmful substances  
- BPA-free components  
- Significant reduction in plastic bottle usage  

**Filtered Water Taste**  
Filtered water from the ZeroWater pitcher was noticeably free of that metallic tang I’d grown used to from my tap. My tea and coffee also tasted drastically better, with a cleaner and fuller flavor that owed nothing to my brewing skills, I’m sure. My kids even commented that the water tasted ""less weird,"" which, in their language, is a glowing endorsement. For cooking, the difference is subtle but notable, especially for soups and broths.

**Negatives**  
- The filter lifespan can be short if your water has high TDS levels, becoming an expense if you use it heavily.  
- Some users, like my neighbor who tested it, noted that there is no visible indicator on the pitcher itself for when filters need changing, apart from the TDS meter.  
- Replacement filters aren't always easy to find locally and require prior ordering online.  

**Ease of Setup and Maintenance**  
Getting started was a breeze. The pitcher arrives assembled, all you have to do is rinse the filter and fit it snugly into the system. It’s clear ZeroWater designed this product with busy households in mind. However, what surprised one of my coworkers when borrowing it was how frequently the filter required changing after only a month. Of course, this depends on the water quality in your area; our well water is particularly hard, so the faster filter depletion wasn’t an enormous surprise.

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to other water filter pitchers I’ve tried, such as Brita and PUR models, ZeroWater stands out in terms of filtration efficiency. While Brita pitchers improve taste and reduce some contaminants, they don’t quite purify water to the same extent. I also own a PUR pitcher, which feels bulkier, and I noticed the taste improvement wasn’t as pronounced. One downside with ZeroWater, however, is the cost of replacement filters compared to these brands. On the other hand, the TDS meter is a fantastic touch that competitors lack entirely. It gave me the reassurance I didn’t know I needed when it came to water purity.

**Financial Value**  
This isn’t the cheapest way to improve tap water, but it’s highly effective. The energy-free design adds long-term cost efficiency, and considering it can save up to 110 plastic bottles per filter, it aligns with an eco-conscious mindset. While the price point for replacement filters requires a bit of budgeting, the purified water's quality makes it worthwhile. ZeroWater delivers a premium experience that justifies its cost for most households.

1nqdoje,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1nqdoje/elena_porter_discovered_her_husbands_secret_life/,Elena Porter discovered her husband's secret life at 3:47 PM outside an elementary school,"Elena Porter discovered her husband's secret life at 3:47 PM outside an elementary school. She watched in stunned silence as the man she'd married embraced another woman and kissed a little girl who called him ""Daddy.""

But this devastating discovery was only the beginning. Her three-year marriage, her four-year relationship, her entire life had been an elaborate con game. Her in-laws, her best friend, even the prestigious art gallery where she worked—everyone was in on the conspiracy, all for one prize: her massive inheritance that was about to come through.

They thought she was just a grateful orphan who would accept any scraps of affection. They thought she was weak, naive, easy to control. They were about to discover that an underestimated woman is the most dangerous enemy of all.

……



My name was Elena Porter, and I believed I had found my forever family. After growing up bouncing between relatives who saw me as a burden, the Whitmore family had taken me in during college. Their daughter Sarah had become my best friend, their son Marcus my devoted husband of three years. I was an art curator at their prestigious gallery, surrounded by beauty and love.

It was all perfectly, devastatingly false.

The crack in my perfect world appeared on a Thursday morning. Marcus had left early for a ""client meeting in the art district,"" kissing me goodbye with the same tenderness he'd shown every morning since our wedding. But when I arrived at the gallery, Sarah mentioned offhandedly that she'd seen Marcus's car parked outside Bella Vista Elementary School the previous day.

""Strange,"" she'd laughed. ""What would he be doing there?""

The question haunted me through my morning rounds of the gallery. Marcus didn't know any children. We'd been trying to start a family for two years, but he'd insisted we wait until his architecture firm was more established. The timing never seemed right.

That afternoon, I drove to Bella Vista Elementary. The school day was ending, and I watched from across the street as children streamed out toward waiting parents. And there, unmistakably, was Marcus. He stood beside a silver SUV I'd never seen before, his arms open wide as a little girl with dark curls ran toward him, shouting ""Daddy!""

My world tilted on its axis.

The girl looked about six years old. She had Marcus's green eyes and his dimpled smile. As I watched in stunned silence, a woman emerged from the driver's seat of the SUV. Tall, elegant, with honey-blonde hair – everything I wasn't. She kissed Marcus on the lips with casual familiarity while the little girl chattered excitedly about her day.

I sat frozen in my car, watching my husband – my husband – lift this child onto his shoulders and climb into the passenger seat of another woman's car. They drove away like the family I thought we were trying to build.

The betrayal hit me in waves. First shock, then denial, then a crushing realization that transformed every memory of our relationship into a lie. How long had this been going on? Who was this woman? And why was Marcus pretending to love me when he clearly had a whole other life?

I drove home in a daze, my hands shaking on the steering wheel. When Marcus returned that evening, he kissed me hello and asked about my day as if nothing had changed.

""The client meeting went well,"" he said, loosening his tie. ""Mr. Peterson finally approved the museum renovation designs.""

Another lie. How many others had there been?

That night, as Marcus slept peacefully beside me, I stared at the ceiling and realized that the man I'd shared a bed with for three years was a complete stranger.

\##Chapter 2

I couldn't confront Marcus immediately. I needed proof, and more importantly, I needed to understand the scope of the deception. Was Sarah involved? Were her parents, William and Patricia Whitmore, who'd given me a job and treated me like a daughter, part of this elaborate charade?

The next morning, I called in sick to the gallery – the first sick day I'd taken in two years. Instead, I drove to the address I'd found by following the silver SUV's license plate through an online database. It led me to an upscale neighborhood across town, to a beautiful Victorian house with a garden full of roses.

Through careful observation from a coffee shop across the street, I learned that the woman's name was Victoria Manning. She was a pediatrician with her own practice. The little girl was named Emma, and she attended private school and ballet classes. They lived a comfortable, seemingly perfect life.

What I couldn't understand was how Marcus afforded this double life. His architecture firm was successful, but not wealthy enough to support two households. That's when I remembered the joint account William Whitmore had opened for Marcus and me as a wedding gift. The account we barely used because Marcus insisted on maintaining our separate finances ""for independence.""

I accessed the account online that afternoon. What I found made my blood run cold.

Regular transfers. Large ones. From William Whitmore's personal account to ours, and then immediately transferred out to an account I didn't recognize. For three years, my father-in-law had been funding this secret life, and Marcus had been funneling the money to support his other family.

The pattern was meticulous. Every month, the same amount. Always with a memo that read ""Family Support - E.M."" Emma Manning.

My entire world – the job at the gallery, the beautiful apartment Marcus and I shared, even my relationship with Sarah – was built on lie after lie. The Whitmores hadn't just known about Marcus's secret family; they were actively funding it.

But why?

That evening, I sat at our dining room table, surrounded by financial documents I'd printed, when Marcus came home. He looked tired, stressed in a way I'd attributed to work pressure. Now I wondered if the strain came from maintaining his double life.

""You're home early,"" I said, keeping my voice level.

""Light day at the office,"" he replied, hanging his coat in the closet. ""How are you feeling? Better?""

The concern in his voice sounded genuine. That was perhaps the cruelest part – Marcus wasn't a cartoon villain. He was tender with me, attentive, seemingly loving. Which made his betrayal feel like a knife twisted in my chest.

""Much better,"" I lied. ""Marcus, can I ask you something?""

He settled beside me on the couch, his attention focused and caring. ""Of course.""

""Do you ever want children? Really want them?""

Something flickered across his face – too quick for me to interpret. ""You know I do. We've talked about this. When the time is right—""

""When will the time be right?"" I pressed, studying his expression.

He took my hands in his, his thumb stroking across my wedding ring. ""Soon, Elena. I promise. I want nothing more than to start a family with you.""

The lie rolled off his tongue so easily. He already had a family. A daughter who called him Daddy. A woman he kissed goodbye every morning while I thought he was going to work.

That night, I made my decision. I was going to find out everything. The whole truth, no matter how much it destroyed me.

\##Chapter 3

My investigation began in earnest the next Monday. I hired a private investigator – Rachel Torres, a former police detective who specialized in marital infidelity. I gave her Marcus's photo and the few details I'd gathered about Victoria Manning and Emma.

""I need to know everything,"" I told her in her small, cluttered office. ""How long this has been going on, whether there are others, and why my in-laws are involved.""

Rachel's expression was sympathetic but professional. ""These cases are never easy, Mrs. Porter. Are you prepared for what we might find?""

I thought about the little girl with Marcus's eyes, about the casual way he'd kissed another woman, about three years of marriage that had apparently been built on deception.

""I'm prepared,"" I said.

While Rachel worked, I conducted my own investigation at home. I searched through Marcus's belongings when he was at work, looking for anything that might give me insight into his secret life. In a locked drawer in his home office – a drawer I'd never thought to question – I found a second cell phone.

The phone was password protected, but Marcus had always been predictable with his passwords. He used variations of our wedding date and my name. Except this time, when I tried Emma's birthday – a date I'd found on a school form in his car – the phone unlocked.

What I found inside broke my heart all over again.

Text messages between Marcus and Victoria going back four years. Before our marriage. Photos of Emma as a baby, as a toddler, taking her first steps. Videos of birthday parties I'd never known about. A whole photographic history of a life Marcus had been living parallel to ours.

But it was the text exchange from the previous week that finally gave me the context I'd been missing.

Victoria: ""Emma's asking why she can't meet your wife. I'm running out of excuses.""

Marcus: ""Not yet. Elena doesn't know about you. If she finds out before the gallery acquisition goes through, everything falls apart.""

Victoria: ""This can't go on forever, Marcus. I won't keep pretending we're just friends when people ask. Emma needs stability.""

Marcus: ""Six more months. Once Elena's inheritance from her grandmother comes through and we get the gallery expansion funded, I'll tell her about us. About Emma. She'll understand.""

Victoria: ""She'll understand that you've been lying to her for four years? That you married her for money?""

Marcus: ""She'll have to.""

The phone slipped from my numb fingers, clattering onto the hardwood floor.

My inheritance. My grandmother had left me a substantial sum that wouldn't be available until my thirtieth birthday – still six months away. Marcus was waiting for that money. The gallery expansion he'd been discussing with William Whitmore, the investment opportunity he'd been so excited about, was funded by my future inheritance.

I'd been a mark. A target. A convenient source of funding for his real life with Victoria and Emma.

Everything made sick, twisted sense now. The rushed courtship after my grandmother's death when the will was read. The insistence on marriage before living together. The way the Whitmores had embraced me so quickly, offering me a job and a place in their family.

They needed me comfortable, settled, and unquestioning until my inheritance came through.

My phone rang, startling me from my thoughts. It was Rachel Torres.

""Mrs. Porter, I have information for you. Can you meet me today?""

""How bad is it?"" I asked, though I already knew.

""Bad,"" she said quietly. ""You'll want to sit down for this.""

\##Chapter 4

Rachel's report was thorough and devastating. Victoria Manning and Marcus had been together for five years. Emma was indeed his daughter. They'd been engaged when Marcus met me at an art exhibition – an exhibition specifically chosen because Rachel's investigation had revealed William Whitmore had researched my background extensively.

""Your husband was recruited,"" Rachel explained, sliding photographs across her desk. ""The Whitmores knew about your inheritance. They knew you were isolated, had few family connections. Marcus was hired to seduce you and gain access to your money.""

She showed me bank records dating back four years. Victoria's medical practice was failing, drowning in debt from a malpractice lawsuit. Marcus's architecture firm was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Whitmores' gallery was bleeding money, kept afloat only by William's personal fortune, which was smaller than anyone knew.

""Your inheritance isn't just significant to them,"" Rachel continued. ""It's essential. Without it, they all face financial ruin.""

The cruelest revelation was yet to come. Rachel had discovered that Sarah Whitmore – my best friend, my sister in all but blood – was Emma's godmother. She'd been part of Marcus and Victoria's relationship from the beginning.

""I have photos of Miss Whitmore at the child's birthday parties,"" Rachel said gently. ""She's very involved in Emma's life.""

I stared at the photographs of Sarah laughing with Emma, playing in a park I'd never seen, attending school events as a family friend. My best friend had an entire relationship with my husband's secret daughter.

""They're planning to tell you about Victoria and Emma after your birthday,"" Rachel added. ""I found emails discussing the timeline. They plan to present it as if Marcus just recently reconnected with an old flame who had his child. They'll ask for your understanding and support, hoping your gratitude to the family will make you agreeable to sharing your inheritance.""

""And if I'm not agreeable?"" I asked, though I dreaded the answer.

Rachel's expression was grim. ""Based on what I've uncovered, they'll likely pursue a divorce and seek half your assets. But first, they'll try to manipulate you into giving willingly.""

I sat in Rachel's office, surrounded by evidence of the most elaborate betrayal I could imagine, and felt something inside me crystallize into resolve. They thought I was weak, naive, grateful enough to accept any crumb of affection they offered.

They were about to learn how wrong they were.

""I need copies of everything,"" I told Rachel. ""And I need you to do something else for me.""

Over the next week, I played the role of the loving, trusting wife while Rachel worked on the second phase of my plan. I smiled at Sarah's jokes, listened to William's stories about gallery management, and let Patricia Whitmore fuss over my health and my marriage.

At night, I lay next to Marcus and watched him sleep, marveling at how peacefully he rested while living such an enormous lie. Sometimes his phone would buzz with messages from Victoria, and he'd slip into the bathroom to respond. When he returned, he'd kiss my forehead and tell me he loved me.

The performance was flawless. And it was about to end.

She watched in stunned silence as the man she'd married embraced another woman and kissed a little girl who called him ""Daddy.""

But this devastating discovery was only the beginning. Her three-year marriage, her four-year relationship, her entire life had been an elaborate con game. Her in-laws, her best friend, even the prestigious art gallery where she worked—everyone was in on the conspiracy, all for one prize: her massive inheritance that was about to come through.

They thought she was just a grateful orphan who would accept any scraps of affection. They thought she was weak, naive, easy to control. They were about to discover that an underestimated woman is the most dangerous enemy of all.

……



My name was Elena Porter, and I believed I had found my forever family. After growing up bouncing between relatives who saw me as a burden, the Whitmore family had taken me in during college. Their daughter Sarah had become my best friend, their son Marcus my devoted husband of three years. I was an art curator at their prestigious gallery, surrounded by beauty and love.

It was all perfectly, devastatingly false.

The crack in my perfect world appeared on a Thursday morning. Marcus had left early for a ""client meeting in the art district,"" kissing me goodbye with the same tenderness he'd shown every morning since our wedding. But when I arrived at the gallery, Sarah mentioned offhandedly that she'd seen Marcus's car parked outside Bella Vista Elementary School the previous day.

""Strange,"" she'd laughed. ""What would he be doing there?""

The question haunted me through my morning rounds of the gallery. Marcus didn't know any children. We'd been trying to start a family for two years, but he'd insisted we wait until his architecture firm was more established. The timing never seemed right.

That afternoon, I drove to Bella Vista Elementary. The school day was ending, and I watched from across the street as children streamed out toward waiting parents. And there, unmistakably, was Marcus. He stood beside a silver SUV I'd never seen before, his arms open wide as a little girl with dark curls ran toward him, shouting ""Daddy!""

My world tilted on its axis.

The girl looked about six years old. She had Marcus's green eyes and his dimpled smile. As I watched in stunned silence, a woman emerged from the driver's seat of the SUV. Tall, elegant, with honey-blonde hair – everything I wasn't. She kissed Marcus on the lips with casual familiarity while the little girl chattered excitedly about her day.

I sat frozen in my car, watching my husband – my husband – lift this child onto his shoulders and climb into the passenger seat of another woman's car. They drove away like the family I thought we were trying to build.

The betrayal hit me in waves. First shock, then denial, then a crushing realization that transformed every memory of our relationship into a lie. How long had this been going on? Who was this woman? And why was Marcus pretending to love me when he clearly had a whole other life?

I drove home in a daze, my hands shaking on the steering wheel. When Marcus returned that evening, he kissed me hello and asked about my day as if nothing had changed.

""The client meeting went well,"" he said, loosening his tie. ""Mr. Peterson finally approved the museum renovation designs.""

Another lie. How many others had there been?

That night, as Marcus slept peacefully beside me, I stared at the ceiling and realized that the man I'd shared a bed with for three years was a complete stranger.

2

\##Chapter 2

I couldn't confront Marcus immediately. I needed proof, and more importantly, I needed to understand the scope of the deception. Was Sarah involved? Were her parents, William and Patricia Whitmore, who'd given me a job and treated me like a daughter, part of this elaborate charade?

The next morning, I called in sick to the gallery – the first sick day I'd taken in two years. Instead, I drove to the address I'd found by following the silver SUV's license plate through an online database. It led me to an upscale neighborhood across town, to a beautiful Victorian house with a garden full of roses.

Through careful observation from a coffee shop across the street, I learned that the woman's name was Victoria Manning. She was a pediatrician with her own practice. The little girl was named Emma, and she attended private school and ballet classes. They lived a comfortable, seemingly perfect life.

What I couldn't understand was how Marcus afforded this double life. His architecture firm was successful, but not wealthy enough to support two households. That's when I remembered the joint account William Whitmore had opened for Marcus and me as a wedding gift. The account we barely used because Marcus insisted on maintaining our separate finances ""for independence.""

I accessed the account online that afternoon. What I found made my blood run cold.

Regular transfers. Large ones. From William Whitmore's personal account to ours, and then immediately transferred out to an account I didn't recognize. For three years, my father-in-law had been funding this secret life, and Marcus had been funneling the money to support his other family.

The pattern was meticulous. Every month, the same amount. Always with a memo that read ""Family Support - E.M."" Emma Manning.

My entire world – the job at the gallery, the beautiful apartment Marcus and I shared, even my relationship with Sarah – was built on lie after lie. The Whitmores hadn't just known about Marcus's secret family; they were actively funding it.

But why?

That evening, I sat at our dining room table, surrounded by financial documents I'd printed, when Marcus came home. He looked tired, stressed in a way I'd attributed to work pressure. Now I wondered if the strain came from maintaining his double life.

""You're home early,"" I said, keeping my voice level.

""Light day at the office,"" he replied, hanging his coat in the closet. ""How are you feeling? Better?""

The concern in his voice sounded genuine. That was perhaps the cruelest part – Marcus wasn't a cartoon villain. He was tender with me, attentive, seemingly loving. Which made his betrayal feel like a knife twisted in my chest.

""Much better,"" I lied. ""Marcus, can I ask you something?""

He settled beside me on the couch, his attention focused and caring. ""Of course.""

""Do you ever want children? Really want them?""

Something flickered across his face – too quick for me to interpret. ""You know I do. We've talked about this. When the time is right—""

""When will the time be right?"" I pressed, studying his expression.

He took my hands in his, his thumb stroking across my wedding ring. ""Soon, Elena. I promise. I want nothing more than to start a family with you.""

The lie rolled off his tongue so easily. He already had a family. A daughter who called him Daddy. A woman he kissed goodbye every morning while I thought he was going to work.

That night, I made my decision. I was going to find out everything. The whole truth, no matter how much it destroyed me.

The Royal Canadian Theatre Company will open their 2025/26 season with ***They Came From Mars And Landed Outside the Farndale Avenue Church Hall in Time for the Townswomen's Guild's Coffee Morning*** playing both in Surrey and New Westminster. Returning from 2023, enjoy the Farndale ladies putting on a Science Fiction production that will surely go wrong. If you’re wondering, the title still won’t fit on your ticket. They promise a show filled with hilarity and unforgettable action. This production will tour at the Surrey Arts Centre (September 26 - 28) and Anvil Theatre in New Westminster (October 3 - 5), with Season Tickets available until September 2.

You may remember the Farndale Townswomen from 2023’s Murder Mystery, where tennis balls flew across the stage, the set fell apart and poor Gordon’s script got completely soaked. ***They Came From Mars And Landed Outside the Farndale Avenue Church Hall in Time for the Townswomen's Guild's Coffee Morning***, written by David McGillivray & Walter Zerlin Jr, promises physical comedy, innuendo and silly moments galore. All but one of the original cast is returning for this Farndale sci-fi production.

***They Came From Mars*** follows a Community Theatre’s ambitious attempt to stage a locally written Sci-Fi production. Prepare yourself for anything and everything as 5 actors playing 8 different characters struggle to pull off opening night, in front of the author, with the assistance of their frenzied stage manager. What kind of show can this small group of actors with no money, no experience and a head full of dreams produce? Well, they’re all looking forward to the Flower Judging Competition at the intermission.

RCTC is offering a relaxed performance in partnership with the Massey Theatre Society for their performance of ***They Came From Mars And Landed Outside the Farndale Avenue Church Hall in Time for the Townswomen's Guild's Coffee Morning*** on October 4th at 7:30pm. To accommodate people with physical, mental or behavioral disabilities, those living with mental health struggles and the d/Deaf and hard of hearing community, they make technical adjustments to make the performance unlikely to overstimulate and add ASL interpretation.

You know how we always used to have those giant packs of bottled water taking up half the kitchen? I got so tired of the cost and the plastic waste piling up. I started looking into a more permanent solution for the weird metallic taste our tap water sometimes has.



That’s when I finally caved and got a simple water purifying jug. It felt almost too basic at first, but the difference was immediate. The water just tastes… clean. No more funny aftertaste, and my morning coffee actually tastes like coffee now. The best part is the math; the initial jug cost about the same as three of those big water packs, and each filter lasts us a month for a fraction of the cost.



Here’s the thing I found fascinating though: a lot of the ""off"" taste in tap water isn't from harmful contaminants, but from chlorine, which is added to make it safe. The filter in the jug works by absorbing that chlorine, along with other particles, which is why the taste improves so much. It’s like it’s just stripping away the extras to leave the good water behind.



It’s been a few months, and I can’t imagine going back. The kitchen is less cluttered, I’m not constantly hauling plastic bottles from the store, and I actually enjoy drinking water from the tap. It’s one of those small, simple changes that just makes daily life a little bit better.

1nqdfg7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqdfg7,How can I make the most of this beautiful living room?,"So my husband and I just moved into a new place, and by far my favorite is this beautiful living room. I really would love to make the most of it, and really lean into the cozy, craftsman style vibes here. I had the following questions for you amazing folks to start!

1. Only piece of furniture I have in this space so far is that on the right sofa. Color doesn't show well here but it's a nice mossy green. Does it work here? I was thinking of adding two chairs facing it (maybe cream and a pattern) + a rug and a wooden coffee table in the middle. Do you guys have suggestions what styles and colors would work well for the chairs?
2. For the rugs, I was thinking something [like this](https://nordicknots.com/us/product/pierce-beigeorange). I love the border, and the repeating pattern that is different than my solid color sofa. Another alternative which my partner likes is something [like this](https://lahomedecor.com/products/sylvie-boho-modern-parisian-garden-floral-beige-area-rug), which is pretty and I like the greens but I'm not sure if it's too busy.
3. For the windows, what treatments do you guys recommend? I seriously adore them and want to emphasize them. I thought curtains wouldn't go here, and even thought of removing the blinds completely but I do need to be able to close them sometimes for privacy.

And would just love to hear any other general suggestions for things to add here, colors that would work well, stuff like that! I really have no other furniture so it's exciting that it's an open slate. Love this sub and thanks in advance for any suggestions!",2,1758822316.0,interiordecorating,4,1.0,False

Animals in captivity tend to become docile after some time. Typically, animals born in captivity don’t develop a fear of the humans who come to bring food to them or the people who visit their enclosures all the time to gawk at them. The wild ones, however, are the ones that give the most fight and take the longest to become tame. They thrash and posture at the caretakers any time they come near them. Even if they only snarl and bare their fangs in a corner, they patiently wait for you to let your guard down around them. Thinking that maybe if you think you can be comfortable around them, they’ll get their opportunity to strike.

I didn’t plan on making the same mistake as I had before. I had taken a few extra days off work to tire out the Hollow I’d captured. This one had a lot more energy and stamina than the last one. I fashioned a new place to hold it, mostly out of fear that it would break free from the weak pipes on the sink. They could give at any moment had it kept thrashing around like it tended to do from time to time. I built a bar mounted to the hardwood floor and upgraded to some handcuffs and heavy-duty chains.

I had become a regular customer at the neighborhood hardware store, and the cashiers started to know my name. No doubt some of my purchases had become questionable, so I started visiting other places further away to draw suspicion away from my purchases.

The hollow now had a short chain lead that would be nearly impossible for even a healthy, full-grown adult to break out of, much less some hideous abomination that had barely any strength. Every day, it seemed to put up less of a fight; it wouldn’t be long now until I could leave it alone and return to work again.

I was grateful for that fact.

I had been tending my wounds and trying to ration out the morphine, slowly weaning myself from it. I was down to the last vial, and I knew I would have to deal with some withdrawal once it was gone. I wanted to mitigate as many of the side effects as I could.

Today would be a trial run. I slid a microwave dinner toward the Hollow with a push broom; it barely moved. There was a small clink as it lifted its head to see that I was still a safe distance from it and then down at the pitiful offering. Then it lay its head back down in defeat. That's what it seemed to do the last few days. I shut and bolted the door, then closed the new bars I had just installed and secured them, as well.

I pulled on it to make sure the hatch remained in place.

Between feedings, I would frequently make ten to twenty-minute trips out into town for supplies, but I never left too long or went too far away. I had to make sure that if it had gotten out, I could stop it. Getting inside the house was easy; getting out was a different story.

I had visited an opioid addiction clinic during one of my latest trips out. It was a little further than I felt comfortable with, and I had been gone for an hour or so. Nevertheless, I had to make the trip. I fiddled with the single pill in the bubble package they'd given me.

I had told them that it was an overuse of medications I had gotten from the hospital from a fight I had been in a few days prior, and that I only needed a single dose to come down. They must have believed me, because they gave me a single outpatient dose and sent me on my way. I don’t know if it was because I had no criminal record, or that I didn’t act like the fiending junkies that littered the waiting room, or because my story seemed believable. Either way, I was grateful that I could leave that neighborhood intact and without giving any of my information to them; the less of a paper trail, the better.

I popped the bubble packaging and placed the pill under my tongue, letting the bitter taste drain into my throat. It was terrible, but I knew it would help dull some of the pain of the withdrawal.

*Tomorrow, I have to go to work and I need to be presentable.*

My entire body shook, and I was dripping in sweat; every muscle ached, and I strained to even drink water. I forced down room-temperature bottle after bottle I had laid out for myself before the pain got too unbearable to walk. Every sip felt like needles in my throat, and I felt a crushing knot in my stomach as it struggled to keep the water down.

By midnight, I was up and walking around. I hadn't heard anything from the Hollows room in a few hours. I cracked open the door and peered inside; it lay there motionless. The only sign that it had any life in it was the rise and fall of its bony ribs, which flared with each intake of breath. I quietly shut the door and slowly made my way to the couch. I threw a blanket over myself and let sleep overtake me completely for the first time in days.

 

I woke to my alarm early in the morning. My eyes shot open, I shut it off, and made my way to the Hollows door. I heard soft, muffled breathing. I slowly backed away and quietly made my way up the stairs to get ready. I carefully clipped the stitches on my scar, which had just closed enough for me to feel comfortable removing them. I then carefully washed and shaved my face, trying my best not to put pressure on the healing bruises.

It wasn’t my best work, but it’d have to do.

I finished getting ready, then made my way out the garage door, and headed out to work. For the first time in a few weeks, I felt like things were finally going in my favor. I even put my music on at a low volume, but I kept my eyes open for anything strange.

 

I arrived at work and stepped into the front doors. As expected, there was a reaction from the front desk. As soon as she saw me, Amanda gasped.

“Mark, what happened to your face?” She asked, astonished.

“Oh, yeah. Bar fight.” I lied casually.

“Oh, my goodness, what was it for?” She inquired worriedly.

“Ah, just some ass hole I beat at darts.” I continued with the lie.

“He got you pretty good, it looks like?” She tsked.

“Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.” I replied

“Why? Is he worse?” She asked.

“No, like you should’ve seen him. Six-five, Greek god build. I didn’t stand a chance.” I joked and she laughed. “What are you doing Friday?” I asked boldly.

 

Life was beginning to get back to normal. As normal as it could be with a monster trapped in my house and the constant threat of something coming from the shadows to finish me off.

It had been about two weeks since I had started seeing Amanda. Word around the clinic spread like wildfire, and everyone seemed to gossip in hushed whispers any time I walked through. I wasn’t going to take anything seriously yet, not until things got more under control. Although how much more under control could it get? I hadn’t seen another Hollow since I captured one two weeks prior.

Things were quiet for sure, and while I enjoyed the silence, I couldn’t help but keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something. Anything. Although nothing ever came. It was just my thoughts playing tricks on me. A shadow out of the corner of my eye, or something rustling in the bushes, only for a small rodent to jump out and scurry away.

The Hollow I had captured barely seemed to have life left in it; all it seemed to do was lie in the same spot and breathe. I almost began to feel sorry for it; hell, I probably would have if it didn’t try to attack me any time, I got close to it. The last few days, it had stopped eating the food I brought it. I started to think that there was something wrong with this one and that I was wasting my time keeping it alive.

I hadn’t learned anything new from this one that I didn’t already know from the last one. Maybe it would be better to put it out of its misery. No, I couldn’t have those kinds of thoughts. Even if it was useless to learn from, there was still the possibility that I could bring him back to normal. I couldn’t give up on that chance.

I finished the last few buttons of my shirt and stood in front of the mirror for a final check. This would be my third date with Amanda, and I was still trying to make a good impression. We had gone first to coffee and then to a movie. This time, I had a nice dinner planned for the evening. I finished with a tie and a navy-blue coat and did a once-over before heading out through my garage.

I headed into the restaurant and told them my name for my reservation. To my surprise, she was already seated even though it was five minutes early. I smiled, and she returned it. I sat down and we ordered drinks.

The night was going well, and we talked about the usual things, the chaos of treatment in the back. She told me about how the front desk always had to keep owners calm or make update calls, keeping customers informed.

At some point, however, we got to the topic of the dreams she had been having.

 

“You don’t really seem to get much sleep; you're looking so tired lately.” She inquired, sounding worried.

“Nah, I’m used to it,” I brushed it off, “I’m a lot tougher than I look. Besides, I don’t really like to sleep, and I don’t dream much when I do.”

“Really?” She said exasperatedly. “I had this dream the other night that something was chasing me. I couldn’t see what it was, but when I woke up, I swear I saw a face looking at me.”

I nodded, listening to her story. “Wild, dreams like that are from stress, I hear.”

“Yeah, there’s been a lot going on lately. Also…” Her eyes looked away from mine for a second. “I’ve been really worried about you. Things seem off lately, I can’t really understand it.”

It looked like my front wasn’t as rock solid as I’d hoped; people were starting to notice the cracks in my veneer.

“Well, go on. Maybe I can explain some of the worries you’ve been having.” I told her, hoping to ease some of her anxieties.

“Some days you come in and you’re fresh and happy like your normal self.” She explained. “But then out of nowhere it’s like… you’re just so much different, like a completely different person. You look different, you act different, even the way you walk seems like… you're scared of something. Are you afraid of something?”

Her eyes pleaded for the truth. It was something I couldn’t give her, but I could offer, at the very least, something to comfort her.

“It’s been hard lately,” that part was true, “my grandfather died in hospice last week. Between that and the insanity that’s been going on in the neighborhood…” I sighed. “It’s exhausting, and I’m just trying my best.”

She took my hand and smiled comfortingly. “You’re doing great, Mark.”

I felt the air grow still and dark, and that familiar frigid chill that hung by breath in the air. I saw Amanda look up and smile. It took everything in me not to look as I heard a guttural clicking and a looming presence over my shoulder. There was the sound of a throaty droll from over my shoulder, and I felt my body turning on its own. My eyes met the empty sockets of a Hollow. Dread washed over me, and I felt my face turn pale.

Amanda said something, but she sounded so very far away. The entire world was drowned out; it was only me and the monster that now stood over me, its sagging flesh rippling in slow motion as it opened its mouth. I knew what was coming, and I knew I wouldn’t have time to brace myself for it.

It let out a shattering, piercing shriek which knocked me out of my chair. Every muscle in my body locked, and I felt paralyzed. The solid ground rushed up to meet me. I didn’t feel the impact, but I knew the wind had been knocked out of me. I looked at the Hollow, and its hands reached for me, its fingers outstretched toward me.

I couldn’t get a breath in; my chest felt like it was too heavy. I saw the corners of my vision start to turn black as I could feel the strain pulling me into unconsciousness. Within seconds, panic flooded over me, but I was powerless to do anything about it.

The last thing I saw before complete darkness was the inhuman, sagging, fleshy fingers of the Hollow reaching for me.

 

I woke up to the sound of music, my head pounding and…lights.

I realized my head was leaning against a glass pane.

A window? No, I was moving. I closed my eyes tight and opened them, trying to get my bearings. I was in a car, but I wasn’t the one driving. I looked over to the driver's side, and Amanda smiled at me, noticing I was finally awake.

“Well, good morning, sleeping beauty.” She greeted.

“What happened?” I said groggily.

“You looked at the waiter and freaked out. I think it might have been a seizure.” She explained. “We’re on our way to St. Junipers.”

“I don’t think I need a hospital.” I protested.

“You passed out in the restaurant and have God knows what going on.” She insisted. “I’m taking you to the hospital.”

She had a point. I didn’t know what happened when I fell; for all I knew, I had a concussion. I resigned myself to at the very least getting checked out.

 

I was admitted quickly for emergency care. I told Amanda that she could go, and explained that I would call a rideshare to retrieve my car. She warned me to text her when I got an update on my condition. I agreed, and she waved me off.

At the hospital, they did several neuro exams to make sure I didn’t suffer from a concussion. After that, the nurses came in to ask me what happened. I explained that I wasn’t sure what caused it, that I used to suffer from chronic tinnitus, but it had suddenly disappeared after seven years of continuous ringing. I told them how I had tried everything possible, and nothing ever stopped it, that it just went away one day.

“So, what about the fall. What triggered it? Did you hear anything or maybe see something?” She asked.

I paused for just a moment. I couldn’t tell them what I was seeing; they would think I’m crazy and put me on a 48-hour psych hold.

“No,” I replied, “no, nothing like that, I just… I don’t know, I lost my balance and passed out.”

“Okay, well, I’ll get that passed along to the doctors. They’re probably going to want to get a brain scan and see if there’s anything concerning.” She typed into the laptop she’d brought in. “If it comes up clear, we’ll go ahead and send you home, sound good?”

She smiled, I nodded, and she left.

I got a sneaking thought that she didn’t believe me. There was something about the way she said it that didn’t sit right with me. I knew when someone held judgment in their voice. It was something I did my best to hold onto when I had to deal with owners.

 

Laid out on my back in a hospital gown in a claustrophobe's worst nightmare, I did my best to keep still with the sounds of grinding mechanical whirling echoing in my bones. It only took about ten minutes, but it felt like an hour inside.

Being told not to move made it worse. When someone tells you you’re not allowed to move, that’s when you start to itch; it’s always in the most inconvenient places, too. It was my face that itched, but even if I wanted to, there wasn’t enough room to reach up to scratch.

 

Afterward, I was wheeled back to my bed, where I waited for the results; they came about three hours later when the Neurology specialist came to see me. A tall man with a dark complexion and a solemn look on his face who looked like he’d worn it his entire life.

“Mr. Andrews, good evening.” He said as he entered, holding a thin laptop computer.

“How’s it going, boss?” I replied casually.

“I’m doing well, I just have a few questions for you.” He said, powering on a display screen that hung on the wall.

“Okay,” I replied nervously, “like what?”

“First off, do you have a history of heavy drug use?”

His words hit me like a ton of bricks.

“N…No. Of course not.” I replied.

“No, LSD or amphetamines?” He went on connecting a cord to his laptop.

“No. Never.” I said truthfully.

“Have you ever heard or seen something that no one else could?” He went on.

I paused for just a second before shaking my head. The nurse must have told him that she didn’t believe me.

He punched a few keys into his computer and clicked his mouse a few times. A brain scan showed up. There was a small, dark grey area in the center on both the right and left sides of the brain in the image.

“There are signs of deterioration in the Heschl’s gyrus portion of your brain, which could explain why you used to suffer from severe bouts of tinnitus.” He explained. “There are only a few things that can cause deterioration like this, one being heavy illicit drug use, and the other would be a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.”

I listened intently, taking in his words. It couldn’t be something like that.

“Although, typically something like that would leave much larger areas of your brain affected and also cause many other physiological changes, which don’t seem to be present.” He said, I felt a little more relieved at this. “We don’t have any reason to keep you here, Mr. Andrews. I assume that years of intense tinnitus may have caused deterioration in the audio processing part of your brain, which may have been what caused the fainting spell you experienced today.”

“So, I’m okay to go home?” I asked.

“I suggest you follow up with a specialist to figure out if they can do anything else for you. I cannot stress this enough, Mr. Andrews. If you leave this alone, things like what happened today could become much more frequent.” He warned.

 

After I got back to my car, I texted Amanda.

*Everything is okay, they said it was vasovagal syncope.*

She replied within a few seconds.

*What’s that?*

*Kind of like vertigo, it’s a spike in cortisol that causes your blood pressure to drop fast and your brain kind of just shuts off.*

*OMG, is it serious?*

*No, it’s usually caused by stress or dehydration. I’m sorry about tonight. I was so nervous about making sure it was a good date.*

*Hey, no problem. Just make it up to me next time, k? ;)*

I felt a flutter in my stomach. Of course, I felt bad about lying to her, but I couldn’t know what they had told me. Not until I sorted all of this out. I started my car and drove home. Once I got there, it was already well past 2 a.m. I quietly entered through my garage and checked on the Hollows' door, still secured. It was late, and I didn’t want to deal with it now. Tomorrow was another day, tomorrow I could figure out their secrets. For now, I needed to sleep.",1,1758822311.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

*Hey everyone, I’ve just published a new short story. Here's a short excerpt for this week's story.*

I used to be a man with hair. Not just any hair, mind you, but what I considered to be a **magnificent, deity-level crown** of brown waves that shimmered like chocolate silk under Port Alberni’s four minutes of annual sunshine. At least, that’s what I told myself every morning in our tiny bathroom mirror while Susan yelled through the door that I was fogging it up again.

The truth, as I’ve come to learn, is a slippery thing. Like trying to grab wet soap while blindfolded, or trying to cling to the last few strands of a dying follicular civilization.

It all began on a Tuesday in March 2003, which already feels like the kind of date baldness would choose for an ambush. I was getting ready for my shift at the mill, humming the *Hockey Night in Canada* theme, running my fingers through what I still believed to be my Samson-level locks, when I felt it. Or rather… didn’t feel it.

Where there should’ve been a soft thicket of virile man-mane, there was just **skin**. Smooth. Pale. Betraying me like Judas in a shampoo aisle.

I froze. Boxer shorts. Work socks. One hand suspended in horror on the back of my head. I looked into the mirror like I was discovering a new continent, except this one was bald, shiny, and utterly treacherous.

“SUSAN!” I hollered, summoning her like a man whose house was on fire, except the fire was emotional and located on the top of his head.

She appeared with her coffee mug, wearing that face wives get when their husbands are being dramatic again. “What now, Dave?”

It’s adequate but I spent more time trying to find the right menu item and clicking just the right spot on the video to mark the correct place for cutting and such.  
  
At around the same time, I saw someone mention on X that they’d like a text-based video editor. It sounded appealing to be able to do precision work without having to do precise point and click. And [Vodomodo](https://vodomodo.com) got born..

It is quite early, has some basic commands for cutting (with or without fades) and adding subtitles (immediate or unfolding). There is a previewer, a timeline, and an editor where you enter your text commands.

I’ll be expanding the command set, and also venture into creating presentation videos.. It’ll be even better once I implement the Chat tab where you can describe what you want to do to the video in natural language!

If that all sounds interesting, please signup to the waitlist on the [website](https://vodomodo.com/) and I’ll keep you informed.

However, I’m struggling to figure how to lay out some of the furniture pieces I was hoping to have in it. Clearly I would not be a good interior designer lol.

One of the problems being: I work from home ~3 days a week, so I need a desk with a monitor on it. I’m unsure if I should squeeze that in my bedroom, or potentially get a smaller couch and put it in the living room.

I’ve included a picture of the floor plan with measurements that I was given, as well as 2 pictures of the model unit for reference. I’ve also added 3 potential ideas for the layout that I was considering (excuse the hand-drawn models lol).

A list of the furniture I was hoping to have:

Living Room:
•L-Shaped Couch
•Coffee Table
•Mounted TV with a TV stand under it
•Small side chair for hosting

Bedroom:
•King size bed
•Night stand (or 2?)
•Dresser (potentially with a small TV put on top)

Unsure of where to put it:

Animals in captivity tend to become docile after some time. Typically, animals born in captivity don’t develop a fear of the humans who come to bring food to them or the people who visit their enclosures all the time to gawk at them. The wild ones, however, are the ones that give the most fight and take the longest to become tame. They thrash and posture at the caretakers any time they come near them. Even if they only snarl and bare their fangs in a corner, they patiently wait for you to let your guard down around them. Thinking that maybe if you think you can be comfortable around them, they’ll get their opportunity to strike.

I didn’t plan on making the same mistake as I had before. I had taken a few extra days off work to tire out the Hollow I’d captured. This one had a lot more energy and stamina than the last one. I fashioned a new place to hold it, mostly out of fear that it would break free from the weak pipes on the sink. They could give at any moment had it kept thrashing around like it tended to do from time to time. I built a bar mounted to the hardwood floor and upgraded to some handcuffs and heavy-duty chains.

I had become a regular customer at the neighborhood hardware store, and the cashiers started to know my name. No doubt some of my purchases had become questionable, so I started visiting other places further away to draw suspicion away from my purchases.

The hollow now had a short chain lead that would be nearly impossible for even a healthy, full-grown adult to break out of, much less some hideous abomination that had barely any strength. Every day, it seemed to put up less of a fight; it wouldn’t be long now until I could leave it alone and return to work again.

I was grateful for that fact.

I had been tending my wounds and trying to ration out the morphine, slowly weaning myself from it. I was down to the last vial, and I knew I would have to deal with some withdrawal once it was gone. I wanted to mitigate as many of the side effects as I could.

Today would be a trial run. I slid a microwave dinner toward the Hollow with a push broom; it barely moved. There was a small clink as it lifted its head to see that I was still a safe distance from it and then down at the pitiful offering. Then it lay its head back down in defeat. That's what it seemed to do the last few days. I shut and bolted the door, then closed the new bars I had just installed and secured them, as well.

I pulled on it to make sure the hatch remained in place.

Between feedings, I would frequently make ten to twenty-minute trips out into town for supplies, but I never left too long or went too far away. I had to make sure that if it had gotten out, I could stop it. Getting inside the house was easy; getting out was a different story.

I had visited an opioid addiction clinic during one of my latest trips out. It was a little further than I felt comfortable with, and I had been gone for an hour or so. Nevertheless, I had to make the trip. I fiddled with the single pill in the bubble package they'd given me.

I had told them that it was an overuse of medications I had gotten from the hospital from a fight I had been in a few days prior, and that I only needed a single dose to come down. They must have believed me, because they gave me a single outpatient dose and sent me on my way. I don’t know if it was because I had no criminal record, or that I didn’t act like the fiending junkies that littered the waiting room, or because my story seemed believable. Either way, I was grateful that I could leave that neighborhood intact and without giving any of my information to them; the less of a paper trail, the better.

I popped the bubble packaging and placed the pill under my tongue, letting the bitter taste drain into my throat. It was terrible, but I knew it would help dull some of the pain of the withdrawal.

*Tomorrow, I have to go to work and I need to be presentable.*

My entire body shook, and I was dripping in sweat; every muscle ached, and I strained to even drink water. I forced down room-temperature bottle after bottle I had laid out for myself before the pain got too unbearable to walk. Every sip felt like needles in my throat, and I felt a crushing knot in my stomach as it struggled to keep the water down.

By midnight, I was up and walking around. I hadn't heard anything from the Hollows room in a few hours. I cracked open the door and peered inside; it lay there motionless. The only sign that it had any life in it was the rise and fall of its bony ribs, which flared with each intake of breath. I quietly shut the door and slowly made my way to the couch. I threw a blanket over myself and let sleep overtake me completely for the first time in days.

 

I woke to my alarm early in the morning. My eyes shot open, I shut it off, and made my way to the Hollows door. I heard soft, muffled breathing. I slowly backed away and quietly made my way up the stairs to get ready. I carefully clipped the stitches on my scar, which had just closed enough for me to feel comfortable removing them. I then carefully washed and shaved my face, trying my best not to put pressure on the healing bruises.

It wasn’t my best work, but it’d have to do.

I finished getting ready, then made my way out the garage door, and headed out to work. For the first time in a few weeks, I felt like things were finally going in my favor. I even put my music on at a low volume, but I kept my eyes open for anything strange.

 

I arrived at work and stepped into the front doors. As expected, there was a reaction from the front desk. As soon as she saw me, Amanda gasped.

“Mark, what happened to your face?” She asked, astonished.

“Oh, yeah. Bar fight.” I lied casually.

“Oh, my goodness, what was it for?” She inquired worriedly.

“Ah, just some ass hole I beat at darts.” I continued with the lie.

“He got you pretty good, it looks like?” She tsked.

“Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.” I replied

“Why? Is he worse?” She asked.

“No, like you should’ve seen him. Six-five, Greek god build. I didn’t stand a chance.” I joked and she laughed. “What are you doing Friday?” I asked boldly.

 

Life was beginning to get back to normal. As normal as it could be with a monster trapped in my house and the constant threat of something coming from the shadows to finish me off.

It had been about two weeks since I had started seeing Amanda. Word around the clinic spread like wildfire, and everyone seemed to gossip in hushed whispers any time I walked through. I wasn’t going to take anything seriously yet, not until things got more under control. Although how much more under control could it get? I hadn’t seen another Hollow since I captured one two weeks prior.

Things were quiet for sure, and while I enjoyed the silence, I couldn’t help but keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something. Anything. Although nothing ever came. It was just my thoughts playing tricks on me. A shadow out of the corner of my eye, or something rustling in the bushes, only for a small rodent to jump out and scurry away.

The Hollow I had captured barely seemed to have life left in it; all it seemed to do was lie in the same spot and breathe. I almost began to feel sorry for it; hell, I probably would have if it didn’t try to attack me any time, I got close to it. The last few days, it had stopped eating the food I brought it. I started to think that there was something wrong with this one and that I was wasting my time keeping it alive.

I hadn’t learned anything new from this one that I didn’t already know from the last one. Maybe it would be better to put it out of its misery. No, I couldn’t have those kinds of thoughts. Even if it was useless to learn from, there was still the possibility that I could bring him back to normal. I couldn’t give up on that chance.

I finished the last few buttons of my shirt and stood in front of the mirror for a final check. This would be my third date with Amanda, and I was still trying to make a good impression. We had gone first to coffee and then to a movie. This time, I had a nice dinner planned for the evening. I finished with a tie and a navy-blue coat and did a once-over before heading out through my garage.

At some point, however, we got to the topic of the dreams she had been having.

 

“You don’t really seem to get much sleep; you're looking so tired lately.” She inquired, sounding worried.

“Nah, I’m used to it,” I brushed it off, “I’m a lot tougher than I look. Besides, I don’t really like to sleep, and I don’t dream much when I do.”

“Really?” She said exasperatedly. “I had this dream the other night that something was chasing me. I couldn’t see what it was, but when I woke up, I swear I saw a face looking at me.”

I nodded, listening to her story. “Wild, dreams like that are from stress, I hear.”

“Yeah, there’s been a lot going on lately. Also…” Her eyes looked away from mine for a second. “I’ve been really worried about you. Things seem off lately, I can’t really understand it.”

It looked like my front wasn’t as rock solid as I’d hoped; people were starting to notice the cracks in my veneer.

“Well, go on. Maybe I can explain some of the worries you’ve been having.” I told her, hoping to ease some of her anxieties.

“Some days you come in and you’re fresh and happy like your normal self.” She explained. “But then out of nowhere it’s like… you’re just so much different, like a completely different person. You look different, you act different, even the way you walk seems like… you're scared of something. Are you afraid of something?”

Her eyes pleaded for the truth. It was something I couldn’t give her, but I could offer, at the very least, something to comfort her.

“It’s been hard lately,” that part was true, “my grandfather died in hospice last week. Between that and the insanity that’s been going on in the neighborhood…” I sighed. “It’s exhausting, and I’m just trying my best.”

She took my hand and smiled comfortingly. “You’re doing great, Mark.”

I felt the air grow still and dark, and that familiar frigid chill that hung by breath in the air. I saw Amanda look up and smile. It took everything in me not to look as I heard a guttural clicking and a looming presence over my shoulder. There was the sound of a throaty droll from over my shoulder, and I felt my body turning on its own. My eyes met the empty sockets of a Hollow. Dread washed over me, and I felt my face turn pale.

“What happened?” I said groggily.

“You looked at the waiter and freaked out. I think it might have been a seizure.” She explained. “We’re on our way to St. Junipers.”

“I don’t think I need a hospital.” I protested.

“You passed out in the restaurant and have God knows what going on.” She insisted. “I’m taking you to the hospital.”

She had a point. I didn’t know what happened when I fell; for all I knew, I had a concussion. I resigned myself to at the very least getting checked out.

 

I was admitted quickly for emergency care. I told Amanda that she could go, and explained that I would call a rideshare to retrieve my car. She warned me to text her when I got an update on my condition. I agreed, and she waved me off.

At the hospital, they did several neuro exams to make sure I didn’t suffer from a concussion. After that, the nurses came in to ask me what happened. I explained that I wasn’t sure what caused it, that I used to suffer from chronic tinnitus, but it had suddenly disappeared after seven years of continuous ringing. I told them how I had tried everything possible, and nothing ever stopped it, that it just went away one day.

“So, what about the fall. What triggered it? Did you hear anything or maybe see something?” She asked.

I paused for just a moment. I couldn’t tell them what I was seeing; they would think I’m crazy and put me on a 48-hour psych hold.

“No,” I replied, “no, nothing like that, I just… I don’t know, I lost my balance and passed out.”

“Okay, well, I’ll get that passed along to the doctors. They’re probably going to want to get a brain scan and see if there’s anything concerning.” She typed into the laptop she’d brought in. “If it comes up clear, we’ll go ahead and send you home, sound good?”

She smiled, I nodded, and she left.

I got a sneaking thought that she didn’t believe me. There was something about the way she said it that didn’t sit right with me. I knew when someone held judgment in their voice. It was something I did my best to hold onto when I had to deal with owners.

 

Laid out on my back in a hospital gown in a claustrophobe's worst nightmare, I did my best to keep still with the sounds of grinding mechanical whirling echoing in my bones. It only took about ten minutes, but it felt like an hour inside.

Being told not to move made it worse. When someone tells you you’re not allowed to move, that’s when you start to itch; it’s always in the most inconvenient places, too. It was my face that itched, but even if I wanted to, there wasn’t enough room to reach up to scratch.

 

Afterward, I was wheeled back to my bed, where I waited for the results; they came about three hours later when the Neurology specialist came to see me. A tall man with a dark complexion and a solemn look on his face who looked like he’d worn it his entire life.

“Mr. Andrews, good evening.” He said as he entered, holding a thin laptop computer.

“How’s it going, boss?” I replied casually.

“I’m doing well, I just have a few questions for you.” He said, powering on a display screen that hung on the wall.

“Okay,” I replied nervously, “like what?”

“First off, do you have a history of heavy drug use?”

His words hit me like a ton of bricks.

“N…No. Of course not.” I replied.

“No, LSD or amphetamines?” He went on connecting a cord to his laptop.

“No. Never.” I said truthfully.

“Have you ever heard or seen something that no one else could?” He went on.

I paused for just a second before shaking my head. The nurse must have told him that she didn’t believe me.

He punched a few keys into his computer and clicked his mouse a few times. A brain scan showed up. There was a small, dark grey area in the center on both the right and left sides of the brain in the image.

“There are signs of deterioration in the Heschl’s gyrus portion of your brain, which could explain why you used to suffer from severe bouts of tinnitus.” He explained. “There are only a few things that can cause deterioration like this, one being heavy illicit drug use, and the other would be a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.”

I listened intently, taking in his words. It couldn’t be something like that.

“Although, typically something like that would leave much larger areas of your brain affected and also cause many other physiological changes, which don’t seem to be present.” He said, I felt a little more relieved at this. “We don’t have any reason to keep you here, Mr. Andrews. I assume that years of intense tinnitus may have caused deterioration in the audio processing part of your brain, which may have been what caused the fainting spell you experienced today.”

“So, I’m okay to go home?” I asked.

“I suggest you follow up with a specialist to figure out if they can do anything else for you. I cannot stress this enough, Mr. Andrews. If you leave this alone, things like what happened today could become much more frequent.” He warned.

 

After I got back to my car, I texted Amanda.

*Everything is okay, they said it was vasovagal syncope.*

She replied within a few seconds.

*What’s that?*

*Kind of like vertigo, it’s a spike in cortisol that causes your blood pressure to drop fast and your brain kind of just shuts off.*

*OMG, is it serious?*

*No, it’s usually caused by stress or dehydration. I’m sorry about tonight. I was so nervous about making sure it was a good date.*

*Hey, no problem. Just make it up to me next time, k? ;)*

I felt a flutter in my stomach. Of course, I felt bad about lying to her, but I couldn’t know what they had told me. Not until I sorted all of this out. I started my car and drove home. Once I got there, it was already well past 2 a.m. I quietly entered through my garage and checked on the Hollows' door, still secured. It was late, and I didn’t want to deal with it now. Tomorrow was another day, tomorrow I could figure out their secrets. For now, I needed to sleep.",1,1758822099.0,Creepystories,1,1.0,False

1nqdaig,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1nqdaig/struggling_with_lisdexamfetamine_ssri/,Struggling with lisdexamfetamine. SSRI interactions? Fluoxetine/prozac issues? Escitalopram/lexapro as a solution?,"Hi all. Trying to keep this brief but it'll inevitably be too long. Will stick a tl;dr at the bottom. Apologies in advance. Would really love some input though so massive thanks if you do read and reply.

White male, mid-30s, no alcohol or drug use. Received ADHD diagnosis earlier this year (combined type). I've been on lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse) for just over 2 months. For 4 weeks I was on 30mg, then put up to 40mg for a week or so, and now 50mg for another two or three weeks. Previously tried methylphenidate and found it gave me very little positives and lots of negatives, so made the switch. I also take fluoxetine (Prozac) 20mg daily for anxiety and depression.

So far, I honestly can't say if this is working for me or not. I *think* I experience positive effects - I think my focus is better, and I think I'm getting more done. But it's still not great. I'm still easily distracted; I can easily get stuck on the wrong task and struggle to switch to the right one. I don't seem to experience any 'calming' effects or any 'quietening' of the mind. I still have music playing in my head 90% of the time, my thoughts still race.

In addition there are quite a few negative effects. I have to be *very* careful with my diet, as if I don't have a big high-protein breakfast it sends me to space. The appetite suppression can make lunch challenging, which in turn can increase the intensity of the drug in the afternoon. I tolerate 30mg fairly well a lot of the time but don't see a huge improvement and it wears off quickly; 50mg helps me get more done, but the chance that I get overstimulated and panicky is much higher. There's quite a lot of variance in how it impacts me - some days I barely notice it, other days I feel so overstimulated, amped up and can't sit still. I feel angrier, my temper and my patience are shorter; there's a kind of flatness or apathy that's creeped in; I seem to only really want to spend time by myself; sometimes the crash in mid/late afternoon makes me feel pretty depressed.

The intensity and overstimulation made me wonder if perhaps the fluoxetine was interacting. And sure enough, turns out that fluoxetine inhibits the CYP2D6 enzyme, which can mean it potentiates the effects of lisdex. (I'm not from a science background so forgive my layman's understanding of these things).

The clinician from the ADHD clinic suggested I might want to swap the fluoxetine for a different SSRI which doesn't interact with the enzyme in question. A bit of research suggests either escitalopram (Lexapro) or sertraline (Zoloft) don't particularly interact with the CYP2D6 enzyme. Have tried sertraline previously and didn't enjoy the gastro side effects so thought I might try escitalopram (as citalopram previously worked reasonably well for me). I then went to my GP (PCP for the Americans); they consulted a psychiatrist, who said 1) in their experience they haven't found that escitalopram is very effective, and most people in their experience don't like it, and 2) that I could achieve the same effect of changing the SSRI by instead just reducing the lisdex dose.

Long exposition. So my questions are:

\- Is changing the lisdex dose likely to have the same effect as swapping out the fluoxetine? Or could there be a qualitative difference? (Is it possible that the fluoxetine interaction doesn't just make the lisdex stronger, but also amps up some of the negative side effects, so lowering the lisdex dose could still give me a worse side effect profie than swapping the fluoxetine?)  
\- Is lisdex maybe just not the drug for me? Am I putting too much hope in this and things may just not improve despite tinkering? Are non-stimulant options ever particularly effective? (Earlier this year I tried bupropion instead of an SSRI and it was hellish, so I'm not convinced other NDRIs are gonna work)

Fundamentally, I think the issue here is probably just that lisdex is not a magic wand and I haven't been able to solve all of my problems with ""one weird trick"". So part of the reason I'm posting this is probably just to vent. People talk about ADHD meds in such glowing terms, people tell you it's gonna change your life, and even though I tried very hard to manage my expectations, even though I knew this was a lot of hyperbole, it's still hard not to be disappointed. I'm tired of messing with my brain chemistry; I'm tired of not being able to trust how I feel about things in my life because I don't know how the drugs could be affecting things; I'm tired of waiting for things to settle and never ultimately feeling settled. I miss coffee. At the same time, I'm just starting a part time masters degree and I really really don't want all my coursework to be written during an all-nighter immediately before the deadline (like my undergrad 12 years ago).

Again if you read this far, sincere thanks. I'm amazed and pleasantly surprised that this sub exists. I'm not looking to challenge my current doctor or say that they're wrong or have misled me - but if you have specific experience more relevant to my situation you may be able to give a helpful steer.

At that very moment, a decade of love shattered - something darker, colder, and more dangerous was born within me.

They stole my marriage, my dignity, my future... but they don't know that I'm about to take it all back.

……

The elevator chimed softly as it reached the thirty-ninth floor of the Delacroix Tower, our Manhattan fortress of glass and steel. I stepped out, heels clicking against marble, carrying a tray from my favorite French patisserie—an indulgence meant to surprise my husband, Adrian.

Ten years of marriage, and I still believed in surprises. In gestures. In the fantasy that love could be mended with sweetness.

The penthouse was quiet—too quiet. No staff bustling. No music humming from the sound system. Just silence.

“Adrian?” I called, my voice echoing against the vast walls.

No answer.

I set the tray down, slipped off my heels, and padded toward his study. A faint sound reached me—low, breathless laughter. A woman’s laughter.

The world tilted before I even saw them.

Adrian, my husband, the golden prince of the Delacroix family, sat sprawled on the leather couch. His shirt unbuttoned, his tie loose. And draped across his lap was her—a cascade of dark hair, red silk slipping down smooth shoulders, lips pressed against his throat.

My chest clenched. My pulse roared. The air itself seemed to thicken into glass.

Her name surfaced instantly: Juliette Moreau. I had seen her at galas, flashing her perfect smile, a family friend with whispers of ambition clinging to her like perfume.

Now she was in my home. On my husband.

The tray of pastries slipped from my hands, porcelain shattering across the floor. Adrian’s head jerked up, his eyes locking with mine.

Not guilt. Not shock. Just recognition.

“Elena,” he said, his tone maddeningly calm. “You weren’t supposed to be home yet.”

Juliette turned, lipstick smudged, smirk curling. “Oh,” she said lightly, smoothing her dress without shame. “Well. This is… awkward.”

Awkward?

The life I had built, the years I had given, crumbled in a single word.

Before I could speak, another voice cut through the room.

“Better you found out now.”

I turned. And there she was—Vivienne Delacroix. My mother-in-law. The queen of the dynasty. Her diamond necklace glittered like armor, her gaze sharp enough to slice bone.

“You were never meant to carry this family forward,” she said coolly. “Juliette will give us what you cannot—a future. An heir.”

The words landed like daggers. My infertility—the scar I carried in silence—now wielded like a weapon against me.

Juliette leaned against Adrian’s shoulder, victorious. Vivienne’s lips curved, satisfied.

And Adrian? My husband? He said nothing. He just buttoned his shirt, as if I were already irrelevant.

In that moment, something inside me broke.

The Elena they knew—the loyal wife, the woman who still believed in love—died.

What rose in her place was colder. Sharper. A woman who would not be discarded, not by Adrian, not by Juliette, not by Vivienne.

I forced a smile, smooth and perfect. “Of course,” I said softly. “I understand completely.”

Vivienne tilted her head, faint surprise flickering. She expected tears. Rage. Collapse. Instead, I gave her poise.

But behind my smile, fire ignited.

They thought they had ended me.

They had no idea they had just created their worst nightmare.

\## Chapter 2

Morning light spilled across the Delacroix penthouse, gilding every polished surface with a deceptive glow. From the outside, it was paradise: floor-to-ceiling glass, million-dollar art, and the illusion of harmony. But inside, something rotten pulsed beneath the marble floors.

I adjusted the strap of my silk dress in the mirror, forcing my reflection into perfection. Red lips precise, hair glossy, smile fixed. The kind of smile that says: I am fine. I am unshaken.

Downstairs, Juliette lounged on the sofa, draped in one of Adrian’s shirts as if it were a crown. Her bare legs stretched out over the cushions, a glass of green juice in hand. She didn’t even look up as I entered.

“Adrian prefers the curtains open in the morning,” she remarked, gesturing vaguely at the drawn drapes. “You should’ve known that by now.”

My nails bit into my palm. “You’re right,” I said smoothly. I crossed the room and pulled the curtains wide, flooding the space with sunlight that made her flinch. “Better, isn’t it?”

She smirked, but there was a flicker in her eyes—uncertainty. I stored it away like a gem.

By afternoon, I was trailing behind Vivienne Delacroix as she toured the Hamptons estate with her architects.

“The east wing will be remodeled for Juliette,” Vivienne declared, her tone crisp as glass. “A nursery, three bedrooms, staff quarters. Elena, you’ll coordinate with the designers.”

I nodded, jotting notes in a leather notebook. Perfect secretary. Perfect ghost.

“Yes, of course, Vivienne.”

She barely acknowledged me, too busy discussing wallpaper and imported chandeliers. But I wasn’t just writing notes. I was cataloguing every indulgence, every reckless decision. Evidence of greed. Evidence I could twist when the time came.

When Juliette paused to press a hand to her stomach, her smile coy, Vivienne’s eyes softened with pride.

“She’ll give us heirs,” Vivienne said loudly, so I wouldn’t miss a word.

I smiled sweetly, lips sharp as knives. “I hope for your sake it’s true.”

That night, I retreated into the sanctuary no one knew existed. Behind the false back of my walk-in closet lay a hidden room: walls covered with financial maps, contracts pinned with red thread, a web of connections only I understood.

I added a new file—an unsigned contract from Arthur Moreau, Juliette’s father. His company was bleeding money, desperate for a lifeline. I had drafted the lifeline. It looked like salvation, but it was a noose disguised in fine print.

Once he signed, the Moreau family would be in my debt. And debt, I knew, was sharper than any knife.

At dinner, Adrian appeared late, his tie askew, Juliette glowing by his side. He didn’t look at me as he poured himself a drink, didn’t notice the way my smile never faltered.

“Darling,” I said softly, sliding his glass across the table. “I took care of the estate plans today. Everything Juliette wants will be ready.”

Juliette smirked, but Adrian paused, suspicion flickering in his eyes.

“Good,” he said finally, drinking deeply.

They believed I was compliant. They believed I was broken.

But beneath the mask, I was sharpening my blade.

And soon, they would bleed.

\## Chapter 3

The next morning, I arranged lilies in a crystal vase on the breakfast table. Their perfume filled the air—sweet, intoxicating, almost suffocating. I adjusted a stem until it was perfectly aligned, because if my life had collapsed, at least the flowers would obey me.

Juliette swept into the room in a silk robe, her hair cascading like dark satin, her eyes gleaming with the kind of triumph only someone too foolish to fear can wear. She paused just long enough to ensure the staff had gathered within earshot, then pressed a hand against her stomach with theatrical precision.

“I have the most wonderful news,” she announced, her voice ringing like a bell. “Dr. Rutherford confirmed it yesterday. I’m pregnant. With twins.”

Gasps echoed around the room. Forks clattered against china. Even the butler froze.

I smiled, my hands steady as I poured myself coffee. “Twins,” I repeated softly. “How… efficient.”

Juliette preened, mistaking my calm for surrender. “Some women,” she added, her gaze locking on me with deliberate cruelty, “are simply destined for motherhood.”

Her words struck like a blade to the scar I’d carried for years—my infertility, the whispered shame I had endured in silence. For a moment, I thought my mask might crack. But I pressed the recorder in my pocket, its tiny red light glowing like a heartbeat, capturing every venomous syllable.

They would regret underestimating me.

That evening, Vivienne Delacroix presided over a formal dinner in the family’s marble dining hall. The chandeliers blazed, the wine sparkled, the servants moved in choreographed silence.

And Juliette sat beside Adrian, in my chair.

Halfway through the meal, she reached for her glass with exaggerated grace, her bracelet clinking against crystal. With a flick too precise to be an accident, she tipped her hand. Burgundy wine cascaded across the tablecloth, splattering my ivory silk gown.

“Oh dear!” she gasped, her performance flawless. “How clumsy of me. Elena, you really should sit straighter—posture matters so much.”

Laughter rippled from one corner of the table. Vivienne’s lips curved in satisfaction. Adrian didn’t even glance at me.

I dabbed delicately at the stain, lifting my eyes to Juliette with a smile that never touched my soul. “It’s fine,” I said evenly. “Some things can’t be replaced. Others…” I let the pause stretch, long enough for the silence to sharpen. “…are disposable.”

The room stilled. Juliette’s smirk faltered, just slightly. I savored it.

Two nights later, Adrian took me to his private club downtown. The scent of cigars and whiskey clung to the air, the low murmur of powerful men filling the paneled room. I sat quietly, the dutiful wife, sipping champagne while they laughed over stocks and scandals.

After his third glass of scotch, Adrian leaned toward his friend Charles, careless, arrogant, forgetting—or ignoring—that I was within earshot.

“Trading in an old model for a brand-new one,” he chuckled. “Elena was reliable, but Juliette? She’s the Ferrari. And she’ll give me heirs. Real heirs.”

Charles roared with laughter. “Twins, I hear? Impressive.”

Adrian raised his glass, pride oozing from every word. “Proof I made the right choice. Elena knows her place. That’s why she lasted this long.”

My smile never wavered. My hand rested casually on my clutch, where the recorder hummed, capturing every syllable.

They saw only what they wanted: a humiliated wife pretending to endure.

What they missed was the truth.

The mask I wore was not weakness. It was armor.

And soon, I would wield it like a blade.

1nqd4xq,https://i.redd.it/hiw2z2s4icrf1.jpeg,Better draining soil?,"I am much more used to the spiky friends of the desert and dry places- I do great with aloes, haworthia, sansevieria, etc. But my partner loves the leafy jungle friends, so I'm making him a collection. I've been really relying on the Planta app- I know not to blindly follow it, but all my plants are doing so much better with its advice.

I repotted these with the topical mix from the app: equal parts good potting soil, bark chips, perlite and sphagnum moss. The problem is that the app says I should be watering every 15 days or so, and it's been 20+ for all of them and they are still very wet. I know overwatering is bad, but also that they need water moving through the soil once in a while, not just staying constantly wet.

I am in a humid and cold climate (Oregon coast), so that's probably part of it. They are in non-porous pots because that's what I have in the sizes I need. So I am wondering if I should re-pot them with much more drainage material, like lots of perlite, pumice, etc? 

The specific plants I have that are staying wet for so long are:

* dieffenbachia 'Tropic Snow'
* Dracaena goldeiana
* Coffee plant
* Goeppertia insignis

I also have some other Calatheas, they are still in their nursery pots, but advice for them would be great too. Thanks! ",2,1758821650.0,houseplants,0,1.0,False

1nqd2s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorsAdvice/comments/1nqd2s5/weeklong_stomach_issues_need_advice/,Week-Long Stomach Issues — Need Advice,"Hey all,

Looking for some input. About 1–2 years ago I had a really similar episode — intense stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, gas, and even vomiting from the pain. I figured it was food-related back then, so I cleaned up my diet a lot, cut out fried stuff and most dairy, and over the past year slowly added a few things back (light dairy, occasional treats). Things had been pretty good… until last week.

Since Thursday/Friday I’ve had:
	•	Stomach pain that sometimes radiates into my back
	•	Nausea and reflux
	•	Lots of burping and gas
	•	Diarrhea multiple times a day
	•	Sweating, feeling super tired and run down

Tuesday night was by far the worst — really bad pain and multiple bathroom trips.

Here’s roughly what I ate this past week:
	•	Fri: Flame Broiler (chicken/rice/veggies), hot dog + chips, cocktails
	•	Sat: Breakfast burrito + fries, popcorn, Fanta Zero, Applebee’s burger + veggies
	•	Sun: Eggs/avocado/toast, iced coffee frap, dinner out (can’t remember what)
	•	Mon: Thai chicken/rice/veggies, eggs + sausage + peppers + toast
	•	Tues: Oatmeal, Chipotle bowl (steak/rice/beans/guac), salmon + veggies
	•	Wed: Banana, toast, teriyaki bowl, spaghetti + meatballs, vegan ice cream
	•	Today: Oatmeal with dried blueberries/nuts/honey (coffee sent me straight to the bathroom so I ditched it)

Since Monday I’ve had less coffee, nearly no dairy, and anything too oily or fatty, but I still feel off. Oatmeal seems to sit the best and doesn’t make things worse.

At this point I don’t know if I just ate something bad and it’s taking forever to get out of my system, or if this is something like gallbladder issues, reflux, or an IBS flare. I’m on a work trip so trying to decide if I should hit an urgent care here or wait until I’m home.

Has anyone dealt with something like this that lasted a week or more?

1nqd2mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1nqd2mp/explore_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Explore Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express Worth It,"Using the Keurig K-Cup has been an experience rooted in convenience and flavor. I’ve been a coffee enthusiast for years, trying out various brewing systems, from traditional drip machines to fancy espresso makers, but this compact single-serve coffee maker surprised me with its simplicity and speed. Keurig certainly understands coffee drinkers' needs, and the K-Cup delivers a hassle-free brew without sacrificing taste.

**Design and Compactness**  
The sleek black design of this coffee maker instantly caught my eye. Its modern appearance with clean lines means it blends seamlessly into my kitchen setup. Measuring only 6.5 inches wide, it fits comfortably even in tight spaces, making it ideal for smaller kitchens or office desks. I was impressed by the removable 36-ounce water reservoir because I could brew multiple cups without constantly running to refill it. While small, the unit doesn’t feel cramped or fragile, and it seems like Keurig prioritized utility in every part of the design.  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Process**  
This machine excels in simplicity. With single-button controls, brewing a cup of coffee is as straightforward as inserting a K-Cup pod and selecting one of the three size options—6, 8, or 10 ounces. Within minutes, I had a piping hot, aromatic cup of coffee ready to go. The back-to-back brewing feature, which doesn’t require reheating between cups, means less waiting, especially during busy mornings. Although I didn’t fiddle too much with the ""Strong Brew"" option, when a coworker tried it, they mentioned the coffee was noticeably bolder. Perfect for those who need that extra caffeine kick!  

[Check Keurig K-Cup cost on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b0bn9srqt9/)  

**Travel Mug Friendly**  
What surprised me the most? Its compatibility with taller travel mugs. Since I’m always on the move, brewing directly into my 7-inch travel mug without spilling or awkwardly tilting it was a real win. The removable drip tray made it possible, and cleaning up after brewing was quicker than expected. Often overlooked, this small feature felt like it was designed to adjust to fast-paced lifestyles.  

**Perks**  
- Three brew size options ensure flexibility for personal preferences.  
- Removable reservoir minimizes interruptions between cups.  
- No downtime with back-to-back brewing functionality.  
- Energy-saving auto-off feature activates after five minutes of inactivity, reducing energy use.  
- Compact size allows it to fit in crowded kitchens without hogging counter space.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- I noticed that the machine lacked a true milk frothing option for those craving lattes or cappuccinos.  
- While the K-Cup compatibility is excellent, the pods themselves aren’t environmentally friendly; a better recycling solution might help.  
- Despite its sturdy build, the quality of the reservoir lid felt slightly flimsy during refilling.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to some alternatives, such as the Nespresso Essenza Mini, the Keurig K-Cup offers a more versatile pod system, accommodating a wider variety of coffee options, including tea and hot cocoa. On the flip side, Nespresso machines shine when it comes to delivering creamier espresso shots. The Keurig doesn’t aim for espresso-style richness but focuses on the convenience of customizable coffee. Competitors like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which supports both K-Cups and ground coffee, do rival the Keurig in flexibility; however, the FlexBrew isn’t as compact and doesn’t match the Keurig’s polished ease of use.  

**True Value**  
Does the Keurig K-Cup justify its price tag? For anyone who values quick coffee brewing without the learning curve of programmable machines, this fits the bill. Compared to drip coffee makers, the Keurig minimizes cleaning, ensures every cup is fresh, and reduces overall coffee waste. It’s cost-efficient for single-serve caffeine enthusiasts who don’t need large carafes of coffee sitting on warmers for hours.

1nqd2ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nqd2ct/death_rattle_part_1/,Death rattle part 1,"A couple miles outside Ashwaubenon, WI, there’s this dive called the Rutten Buck. Been there since before the bypass went in. The neon sign out front flickers like it’s had too much of its own stock, casting a sickly green glow over a parking lot buried in layer after layer of snow. No one shovels it anymore. Won’t till it thaws.

Inside, it’s warm enough. It’s the kind of bar that has Wheel of Fortune playing to kill the silence. It smells like spilled beer and deep-fryer ghosts. The regulars are already settled in folks drinkin’ to remember, folks drinkin’ to forget. Me? Tonight I’m drinkin’ for both.

“What’ll it be?” Hank, the bartender, asks voice like rust on a snowplow. He’s been slingin’ beers since I was nineteen, back when you just had to nod and promise not to be a jackass. A rite of passage round these parts.

“My usual,” I say. He’s already got the Busch Light cracked before I finish the word. “And the shake of the day,” I add. Just want somethin’ to pull my brain off the spin cycle. Feels like there’s been a weight hangin’ over me lately. Like God’s draggin’ his feet gettin’ to the good parts.

Dice rattle in the cup. I’m about to roll when the door bangs open behind me. Cold air punches through the bar, wiping out the smell of farts and those cursed pickled duck eggs someone keeps buying.

“They’ll let anyone in here,” Hank mutters, dry as road salt, sarcasm seeping through his words.

I glance back. It’s my brother, Keith: blaze-orange Carhartt zipped tight, snow dustin’ his beard like powdered sugar. Grease stains on his coat probably from a Kwik Trip burger or patchin’ up a sled again.

“What’s the DNR doin’ in here?” someone behind me slurs sounds like Marty, full of Old Fashioneds and freezer pizza. Doesn’t sound like a question. More like a warning.

“Drinking off my Friday,” Keith grunts, shouldering up to the bar. He snatches the dice cup right outta my hand like he’s owed it, rolls. “Ship. Captain. No crew,” he mutters, like it means something.

I set my beer down a little too hard. Foam spills over the lip.

“Alright,” I say. “Why you really here, Keith?”

He looks at me, and there’s something wrong behind his eyes like something’s taken root and won’t let go.

“We need to talk,” he says, voice low. “About last week.”

My gut tightens.

“When we went ice fishin’.”

The words hit like a walleye through the ice cold and sudden. Before I can respond, he clamps a hand around my wrist. It’s like grabbin’ rebar in January. He pulls me off the stool and toward the door.

We pass the slot machines on the way out bells ringin’, lights flashin’ but nobody looks up. Old-timers just keep feedin’ quarters in like it’s Sunday service.

“What the hell is this about?” I ask once we’re out in the lot. Cold hits like a slap, sharp enough to sting your teeth. “The deer? You’re DNR. You’ve probably seen a dozen this week alone. Why’s this one stickin’ to your ribs?”

Keith stops. Turns real slow. His breath clouds the air like smoke off the lake.

“Why? Because we didn’t do what Grandpa would’ve done?” I offer, tryin’ to break the tension. “Didn’t toss it in the truck bed and make pocket jerky? Big deal.” But he’s not laughin’. Not even blinkin’. His jaw’s locked up like he’s chewin’ on a secret.

And in that god-awful pause I realize I don’t wanna hear whatever’s comin’.

“I don’t think it died,” he says finally.

I stare at him. Snow crunches underfoot. The whole world feels like it’s holdin’ its breath.

“Keith…” I say, gentler now. “You need a break. Maybe a vacation. Something with palm trees. That deer was mangled, man. Skull split like firewood.”

He steps closer. Snow creaks under his boots. “There’s stuff out there,” he says, voice barely a whisper. “Stuff you ain’t supposed to see, Jude.”

He digs a cigarette from his coat, lights it with one of those tiny plastic lighters. Flame flickers, catches in his eyes.

“I thought you told Karen you quit.”

He exhales. Smoke curls like a warning. “I thought deer stayed dead.”

The words hang there thin, frozen, wrong.

The bar door creaks open behind us. Warmth spills out with the stink of old smoke and fryer grease.

It’s Hank. “Judas,” he calls. Voice like gravel in a coffee can. “Call came through. I told her you weren’t here.” He squints. “You… might wanna go to church.”

I snort, but it doesn’t sound right. Hank’s compass has always pointed weird, but he follows it like gospel.

“Put it on my tab,” I say, raising my bottle. I already owe him three-fifty. What’s another five?

He looks at me too long. Snow settling in his hair like ash. Then he turns and disappears inside. Door slams behind him, dull and final.

I turn toward my truck. “Tell Dad I said hey,” I call.

Keith doesn’t answer. Just stands there, smoke curling around his face like fog. I climb in. Shut the door. The thunk of it echoes in my chest.

Engine rumbles to life. Radio kicks on. Sabbath. “I’m goin’ off the rails on a crazy train…” I hum along, pulling onto the county road.

That’s when I see it.

A deer. Dead center of the road, staring like it knows me.

I yank the wheel. Tires scream. “Jeepers cripes!” I lurch out, boots crunching in the snow.

But there’s no deer. Just a puddle of black sludge and a metal tang in the air, like burnt wires and pennies.

I step closer.

Then I hear it. Snappin’ branches. A high-pitched, garbled screech. Not quite animal. Not quite anything. Like a deer with lungs full of water, a scream whistling into the dark.

“What the hell…”

I bolt back to the truck. Slam the door. This ain’t somethin’ that stays down.

And next time I see it? I’m not bringin’ dice. I’m bringin’ buckshot.

Snow howls around me. But whatever’s out there, it’s worse. So I do what I always do: grab the shotgun from behind the seat, climb on the roof like I’m settin’ up a deer stand on four wheels, and wait.

Wind bites hard. Nothin’ comes.

“Keith’s story just rattled me,” I tell myself. But my mouth tastes off, metal, rot, burnt plastic. I’d take cold fish fry casserole over this.

I shake my head, try to shrug it off. “I don’t think it died,” his voice echoes in my skull. “No,” I mutter. “It died. We saw it die.”

But my heart’s still thumping wild, louder than the wind. And deep down, I already know: some things come back. And some never leave at all.

My cellphone buzzes in the cupholder, snapping me out of whatever trance I’d slipped into. It’s Shaniqua.

I stare at the screen for a second, then pick up. “Yellow?” I say, trying for a joke, even if it falls flat.

“As much as we hate each other,” she says, clipped and businesslike, “your dumb greeting still makes me want to roll my eyes.”

Her voice no matter how sharp always had this weird way of calming me down. Even in the worst of it. Like something from a better season.

“I’m just callin’ to let you know…” she starts, tone shifting into gear, controlled, efficient. “My parents want to see Jackie and Heidi this weekend. I know it’s your weekend, but they’ve been asking for weeks now. They haven’t seen them since… what, four Christmases ago?”

She’s always been the one to remember the important stuff. The stuff that slips through my cracks.

“Yeah,” I say. “That’s fine. Just let me have Friday night with ’em, alright? I promised I’d take ’em to the movies. They’ve been on me about that one with the guy who works in a coal mine or whatever.”

There’s a small pause. Not cold. Just… quieter.

“Alright,” she says. “Thanks, Jude.”

“Tell the girls I love ’em.”

“I will.”

The line goes dead, and I’m left sitting in the hum of the heater, staring out into the dark. Snow still falling, thick and lazy, covering everything like dust over something long dead.

I take a long, growl-filled sigh, pinching my nose. Not because my ex’s parents wanna see the kids, but because I have no clue where my life is going. Keith, Lord love him, has me spooked about a deer we killed. This and the whole week of losin’ sleep and everything feels like it’s draggin’. I needed this weekend alone.

The truck kicks back into life with a growl. The shotgun slides back into the backseat as I head back home. Whatever is happenin’, I need to get through this. The drive home is quiet no music, no one on the roads, not even a deer.

I rush back to my house, lock the door behind me, and head straight to the bedroom. The shotgun stays close to me as I plug in the girls’ old nightlight and quickly draw the shades. I sit for a long time, staring out the window like the night sky itself might blink. I feel stupid, I'm too old to be spooked by bonfire stories. I shouldn’t be scared of the dark, shouldn’t be using a child’s nightlight. But tonight, that’s what I gotta do.

I don’t remember after that. I must have fallen asleep. I wake up some time later, groggy, the world mentally in a fog. “Where am I?” I ask myself. I find myself in another room, like I’ve been sleepwalking again.

Everything around me is the same, but it feels cold, not just to the touch, but the feel of the room itself has gone cold. I stumble into the kitchen, grabbing the coffee grinds. “This oughta do the trick,” I tell myself as the coffee machine starts brewing.

The air still feels cold as I wait for the coffee, pulling any food I can from the pantry to fix this fog in my body. The stale salty jerky is soft to the touch, spicy to the tongue it reminds me of my childhood. A wrestler used to be in ads for these things; his muscular body and gravely voice always caught my attention. I remember him saying, “crying doesn’t make me less of a man, yeah.”

He ain’t wrong, but part of me can’t cry, not right now. Not while I’m unsure what the hell is goin’ on. That tohing the thing from the road keeps cutting back to my mind. It looked like a deer, but that sound… no single deer could make that sound.

As I finish the jerky, I jump at a small footstep. “Jeepers cripes!” I almost hit my head on the ceiling at the sound. I turn around to see my daughter Heidibeautiful head full of raven black hair.

“Heidi, sweetheart, you scared me.”

She doesn’t respond at first. She’s always a bit moody, but now that she’s in her teen years she’s mastered the teenage silence.

“Heidi,” I call again. Her eyes,once filled with energy. They. They're almost blank, only confusion in them.

“Daddy,” she speaks, somberly. “There was a sound.”

“A sound?” My ears perk up. Was I so lost in thought I didn’t hear it?

“What kind of sound? You can tell Pop-Pop.” I force a weak smile. She frowns like explaining what she hears would gut her like a fish. “It sounded like a scream like a deer mixed with a mountain lion,” she whimpers. “But its insides were full of Auntie’s church casserole” she can’t find the words to describe her horror, so she uses something close to us.

I put a hand on her shoulder, gentle but steady. “I’ll take care of it, kiddo. I’ll find out what causes those sounds.”

She probably knows I’m lyin’. She probably knows I’ll go outside, look around, and come back. I give a shaky, stoic smile as I walk out.

The air is cold not like a usual Wisconsin winter something colder. My breath escapes my lips like my soul is leavin’ my body. As I walk down the patio, passin’ the long-since dead blueberry plant in the colander, the ground feels covered in small twigs each step rough and sharp.

“Jeepers cripes,” I growl under my breath when I step on the twigs again; it stings my foot.

That’s where I meet whatever was making the sounds the deer. It’s standing on two legs. Its antlers are sharp points, thick like tree branches stuck out of its skull, splitting it down the middle. A tire track runs to the right before the antlers. Its breath is… collected. I try to take a step closer, but I snap another twig.

“Sonova,” I whisper as it slowly turns its head. Its neck twists slowly, bones crackin’ as it does. Its eyes are void of anything I’d call life. It starts stepping toward me, and my stomach turns like its antlers are crankin’ my insides out.

The memories come back, when Keith was drivin’, cigarette in one hand, bottle of Busch in the other. We were both drinkin’ the whole weekend, so a little drunk driving wasn’t something we’d say no to, when the car hit the deer. We hop out, look at each other, then the deer. “That’s gotta be a four-pointer,” I slur.

Keith looks frantic, the deer’s head split open from the skull, blood poolin’ a bit. He’s panicked, full of anxiety and whiskey. Keith rushes to the car, with me in pursuit.

We looked at each other, swore a vow of silence, and sped off. We didn’t stop. Hoping we didn’t get caught. DNR won’t look too good if Keith got caught drunk drivin’ down the country road with a beer in his hand.

The memory slams into me like a deer in the headlights us checkin’ the rearview, a trail of deer blood following our car. “Shit!” Keith screams Busch light breathin’ out of him. “Fuck, we gotta get outta here!” He punches the car into gear as we speed down the road, hopin’ the cold winter snow will wash away the blood.

I blink, return to reality. The deer’s still there. It opens its mouth, but no words come out no mating call just a loud, ear-piercing “EEEEEEERERRERE” a sound loud and harsh, like barbed wire rip­pin’ through my ear.

My knees damn near buckle with fear, and for a moment I’m a boy again shiverin’ in a tree stand waitin’ for Dad to tell me it’s okay to climb down. My heart quickens by the second. That’s when it starts to step forward steam risin’ off its hide like fresh pavement.

“Back off,” I mumble. It tilts its head like a dog. Its jaw begins to unhinge itself, lettin’ out another cry. “EEEEEEERERRERE.”

“Back the hell off!” I shout. I can feel the night start to squeeze around me.

My fingers tighten on the trigger as panic takes over. Smoke curls around the barrel as round after round of buckshot fires into the beast.

As the smoke dissipates, the snow starts to fall again. The beast is gone no blood, no body, just tracks. The tracks ain’t deer tracks, nor human. I smile not ’cause I’m happy, but ’cause my daughters can sleep peacefully for the night.

Then a thought hits me “My daughters.” Panic spikes. The night feels like it’s holding tighter; every move like stepping through molasses.

The house feels colder than the snow outside the kind of cold that doesn’t leave when you kick the furnace up. My breath fogs out like a ghost. Heidi’s not in the kitchen. I bolt for her room, heart thumping hard enough to rattle my ribs. I ain’t prayed in years, but I find myself mutterin’ one now Not for me. For the girls. Because if that thing got inside, it ain’t just Heidi; it’s both of ’em.

I slam into the bedroom door, shoulder first. It groans but doesn’t give. “Girls!” I bark, voice breakin’. I hit it again wood splinterin’. Third try and it cracks open.

The room’s empty. Sheets half-pulled, the window gaping wide. Snow spills in like ash. On the floor, Heidi’s stuffed bear. I pick it up, fingers numb. “No… no, no, no.”

“HEIDI!!” I call through the house. The thought of that thing havin’ her eat­ing her makes my mind falter. I pull the sheets off the bed, hopin’ either girl is there. Pillow there. No Heidi. No Jackie. My throat locks up.

There’s a lump under the blanket on the bed. My chest caves as I pull it back. Just pillows. No girls. I check the closet dresses and school clothes sway in the cold breeze.

Then I hear it muffled, thin: “Daddy…”

I freeze. It’s comin’ from below.

The basement door’s cracked; light spills like swamp water down the steps. I take them two at a time, shotgun ready. Broken glass crunches under my boots old whiskey bottles I never tossed. Under the workbench, small slippers peek out Jackie’s.

She turns when I reach,her hazel eyes wide and wet. Heidi huddled beside her.

“Dad… is the bad man gone?” Jackie whispers. Her voice don’t sound right.

My knees damn near give. I kneel down, gather ’em both close. Their pajamas warm against me, the only heat in the room.

“What happened?” I ask.

Heidi just shakes her head, lips quiverin’. Jackie answers for her. “The bad man was lookin’ in our window. We ran down here when it screamed.” She points to the bottles on the floor. “Then it banged around the window,” she sniffles. Her finger points to my whisky bottles. “And your silly juice spilled.”

I hold ’em tighter. “Don’t matter. You did the right thing.” I force the most reassuring voice I got. “Are we safe?” Jackie asks, small.

I look down at cracked cement, the dim bulb swayin’ overhead, the smell of cold ash in the air. “Course we are,” I say, forcing a grin I don’t feel. “Daddy scared him off.” I flex my arm like I used to when they were barely able to walk and chew gum. They give a weak smile back. It’s enough.

Later, we crowd into my room the smallest one in the house. Walls cluttered with old photos, the dumb singin’ bass the girls bought me one Father’s Day. Heidi nods off first raven hair tangled across her face. Jackie fights it a little longer, then curls into my side.

“Sleep, princess,” I whisper. “Daddy’ll be right here.”

I lay there until the sun drags itself over the cornfields, its beams start to chase away the cold. It’s a slow warmth, like the first sip of coffee on a white-winter morning. Despite the energy spent, I can’t sleep. My mind’s plagued with the beast outside the girls’ window, the sound it made. More thoughts come to me. about Keith’s pale blue eyes, his panic, how he and I both saw this thing and neither knew what to do.

I sneak out of bed, Heidi and Jackie’s heads fall off my chest and onto the pillows, their tiny bodies make my bed look smaller. I grab my phone and call the one voice I didn’t think I would my ex. She’s the only safe person I got right now, and knowin’ she knows the girls are safe is enough.

She don’t answer straight to voicemail.

“Shaniqua, hey, so somethin’ came up. I won’t be in town for a few days.” I’m only half-lyin’. “Can you watch the girls a bit longer?” My voice is shaky. “Call me when you get ’em.”

Voicemail clicks. I feel exhausted, really unwell and spent. I think whatever that was it’s causin’ it.

The coffee pot bubbles as I prepare the girls’ school lunches. I write a note on each one: I love you. You’ll be stayin’ with Mom for a bit. As I step outside, the cold snow pelts me. My phone buzzes. Part of me hopes it’s Shaniqua, but in my heart I know who it is.

The image on my phone is Keith’s goofy full-mouth smile him with his old huntin’ dog in his arms like a baby. “Keith. Are you okay?” I answer.

“Jude,” he calls back, almost a hush. “You saw it, didn’t you?” Before I can answer, he keeps talkin’. I clutch my phone tight until my knuckles go white. “I think I think it’s mad at us,” he whimpers.

My mind flashes back to that damn night the car, the skid, the full thump, Keith sweatin’. Headlights wash the snowfall red. For a second I hear an animal cry. I shake myself awake. “Where are you?” I ask.

“Old town road. By Dad’s old huntin’ cabin,” he groans. There’s a loud growl in the phone, not Keith’s, not the dog’s something familiar and wrong.

I quickly grab a cup of coffee to go and lock the doors behind me. I know Shaniqua’ll kill me if I don’t have a sitter for the girls. Thankfully Mom ain’t got nothin’ but Wheel of Fortune tonight. “Ma. Hey. How’s Dad? Anyways Keith’s been bugging me about goin’ huntin’ with him. I can’t go without a sitter. Suppose you watch the girls till she comes? I’ll pay ya.” She says the girls are asleep and the keys are in the usual spot.

I don’t give Mom a second to respond; I kick the engine into life. Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train” picks up again. As I speed down the road, I pass the usual spots Fleet Farm, Kwik Trip, Culver’s with the busted neon “ButterBurgers” sign but none of it feels real. Just landmarks in a dream I’m tryin’ to wake from.

I really would love to make the most of it, and really lean into the cozy, craftsman style vibes here. I had the following questions for you amazing folks to start!



1. Only piece of furniture I have in this space so far is that on the right sofa (black bookcase in the corner is temporary). Color doesn't show well here but it's a nice mossy green. Does it work here? I was thinking of adding two chairs facing it (maybe cream and a pattern) + a rug and a wooden coffee table in the middle. Do you guys have suggestions what styles and colors would work well for the chairs?



2. For the rugs, I was thinking something \[like this\](https://nordicknots.com/us/product/pierce-beigeorange). I love the border, and the repeating pattern that is different than my solid color sofa. Another alternative which my partner likes is something \[like this\](https://lahomedecor.com/products/sylvie-boho-modern-parisian-garden-floral-beige-area-rug), which is pretty and I like the greens but I'm not sure if it's too busy. 



3. For the windows, what treatments do you guys recommend? I seriously adore them and want to emphasize them. I thought curtains wouldn't go here, and even thought of removing the blinds completely but I do need to be able to close them sometimes for privacy. 



And would just love to hear any other general suggestions for things to add here, colors that would work well, stuff like that!

Some days I will go hours with maybe a few sips of a drink. It's not that I forget but I just can't seem to drink more than a sip at a time. 

I also can't finish a full drink, something in my head makes me leave the last sip in the glass or cup. I don't dislike the taste of things I drink so it's not a case of adding flavor to it. 

It's gotten to the point where it's impacting my health. I had a pretty bad bladder infection last month and I get headaches most days.

Cutting out masturbation and cutting down on my coffee/alcohol intake has helped slightly, but the uncomfortable symptoms won't totally go away.  I'm unsure whether the cause is a physical strain injury or more psychological, ie worrying about it? Is it probably right to be concerned over this and go to the doc's? Try cold showers?

1nqcu62,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nqcu62/reveal_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Reveal the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express Worth It,"Testing out the Keurig K-Express was like welcoming a little barista into my kitchen. The compact design caught my attention immediately—it’s surprisingly sleek and doesn’t dominate your counter space. As someone who struggles to wake up without coffee, I appreciated that this model offered simplicity without sacrificing function. With three brew sizes to choose from, the machine brewed every cup quickly, and it was more energy-efficient than I expected. The blend of practicality and modern design already had me intrigued, yet I discovered both noteworthy perks and some quirks while using it daily.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Compact and lightweight, the Keurig K-Express fits seamlessly into small kitchens, dorm rooms, or cozy office spaces. Its modern aesthetic, especially in black, looks upscale without shouting for attention. The removable 42-oz water reservoir was a delightful surprise, letting me brew four 8-oz cups before refilling, which felt efficient for my busy mornings. However, I noticed the plastic construction isn't as sturdy as you might expect. After using it daily for weeks, fingerprints and smudges became slightly noticeable, requiring frequent wiping to maintain that fresh, polished look.

**Performance That Stands Out**  
This machine doesn’t mess around when it comes to speed. From button press to steaming hot coffee, it brewed my cup in just a few minutes. The STRONG button feature stood out, delivering a bold, richer coffee flavor whenever I needed an intense pick-me-up. Having owned slower models in the past, I felt pampered with how seamlessly this handled my urgency for caffeine. The option to brew in 8, 10, or 12-oz sizes also catered perfectly to my varying coffee moods.

[Check Keurig K-Express price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b09715g57m/)  

**Travel Mug Friendly Convenience**  
As someone who’s often racing out the door, the travel mug-friendly design of this product felt genius. The removable drip tray meant I could slide my taller mugs underneath without any hassle. This feature was noticeably absent in my older coffee maker, which required me to awkwardly tilt my mug just to fill it properly. Here, it became an easy part of my routine without spilling even a drop. That said, the drip tray is a touch small and needs regular emptying, which could annoy some users.

**Strengths**  
• STRONG brew button provides bold flavor enhancements  
• Compact design fits any countertop space  
• Compatible with K-Cups and ground coffee using the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter  
• Fast brewing process saves time  
• Multiple cup sizes and a removable reservoir make brewing flexible and efficient  

**Shortcomings**  
• Plastic construction picks up smudges over time  
• The reservoir requires attention when refilling due to its slightly awkward placement  
• Lacking advanced settings that some high-end models provide  

**Energy-Saving Features**  
Coffee isn’t the only thing I care about; energy efficiency strikes the right note too. The machine impressed me with its auto-off feature, which powers it down five minutes after your last brew. It may not seem like a big deal, but it can save energy in the long run, especially for someone like me who tends to forget to turn off appliances. The system is manual overall, but it simplifies things in a no-nonsense manner.

**Product Rivals in the Market**  
When comparing it to models like the Nespresso VertuoPlus or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, each product has distinct strengths. For example, the Nespresso offers creamier coffee and advanced brewing tech, but it comes at a significantly higher price and relies solely on proprietary pods. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew allows brewing full pots along with single-serve options, but it’s bulkier. Keurig K-Express hits that sweet middle spot with seamless compatibility for K-Cups, reusable filters, and compactness, which neither of its competitors fully nail.

**Quality for Price**  
Given its straightforward operation, fast brewing times, and versatile brew sizes, this coffee maker hits that intersection of quality and affordability. Offering a strong cup of coffee without excessive bells and whistles makes it a great entry-level option for anyone upgrading from older models. It’s not overly fancy, but for what you’re paying, it delivers reliable performance every time.

1nqct1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1nqct1q/struggling_with_elvanse_ssri_interactions/,Struggling with Elvanse. SSRI interactions? Fluoxetine issues? Escitalopram as a solution? Or is this just the wrong drug for me?,"Hi all. Trying to keep this brief but it'll inevitably be too long. Will stick a tl;dr at the bottom. Apologies in advance. Would really love some input though so massive thanks if you do read and reply.

I've been on lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse) for just over 2 months. 4 weeks I was on 30mg, then put up to 40mg for a week or so, and now 50mg for another two or three weeks. Previously tried methylphenidate and found it gave me very little positives and lots of negatives, so made the switch. I also take fluoxetine 20mg daily for anxiety and depression.

So far, I honestly can't say if this is working for me or not. I *think* I experience positive effects - I think my focus is better, and I think I'm getting more done. But it's still not great. I'm still easily distracted; I can easily get stuck on the wrong task and struggle to switch to the right one. I don't seem to experience any 'calming' effects or any 'quietening' of the mind. I still have music playing in my head 90% of the time, my thoughts still race.

In addition there are quite a few negative effects. I have to be *very* careful with my diet, as if I don't have a big high-protein breakfast it sends me to space. The appetite suppression can make lunch challenging, which in turn can increase the intensity of the drug in the afternoon. I tolerate 30mg fairly well a lot of the time but don't see a huge improvement and it wears off quickly; 50mg helps me get more done, but the chance that I get overstimulated and panicky is much higher. There's quite a lot of variance in how it impacts me - some days I barely notice it, other days I feel so overstimulated, amped up and can't sit still. I feel angrier, my temper and my patience are shorter; there's a kind of apathy that's creeped in; I seem to only really want to spend time by myself; sometimes the crash in mid/late afternoon makes me feel pretty depressed.

The intensity and overstimulation made me wonder if perhaps the fluoxetine was interacting. And sure enough, turns out that fluoxetine inhibits the CYP2D6 enzyme, which can mean it potentiates the effects of lisdex.

The clinician from the ADHD clinic suggested I might want to swap the fluoxetine for a different SSRI which doesn't interact with the enzyme in question. A bit of research suggests either escitalopram or sertraline don't particularly interact with the CYP2D6 enzyme. Have tried sertraline previously and didn't enjoy the gastro side effects so thought I might try escitalopram (as citalopram previously worked reasonably well for me). I then went to my GP; they consulted a psychiatrist, who said 1) they don't find that escitalopram is very effective, and most people in their experience don't like it, and 2) that I could achieve the same effect of changing the SSRI by instead just reducing the lisdex dose.

Long exposition. So my questions are:

\- Are you someone who takes an SSRI with your lisdex? Which one? Are you aware of any specific ways the drugs interact/the combination affects you?  
\- Are you someone who has switched from one SSRI to another while taking lisdex? How did that go? Positives/negatives?  
\- Is changing the lisdex dose likely to have the same effect as removing the SSRI? Or could there be a qualitative difference?  
\- Are you someone who relates to my experience with lisdex so far? Can you offer any guidance, advice, or hope?  
\- Anyone who changed from lisdex to non-stimulant meds?  
\- Any other suggestions? Any other thoughts?

Fundamentally, I think the issue here is that lisdex is not a magic wand and I haven't been able to solve all of my problems with ""one weird trick"". So part of the reason I'm posting this is probably just to vent. People talk about ADHD meds in such glowing terms, people tell you it's gonna change your life, and even though I tried very hard to manage my expectations, even though I knew this was a lot of hyperbole, it's still hard not to be disappointed. I'm tired of messing with my brain chemistry; I'm tired of not being able to trust how I feel about things in my life because I don't know how the drugs could be affecting things; I'm tired of waiting for things to settle and never ultimately feeling settled. I miss coffee.

Again if you read this far, sincere thanks. This sub is full of people complaining about their problems, and I don't love to add to that noise, but I haven't been able to get all the answers I'd hoped for just through reading.

Cheers x

tl;dr:  
\- 8 weeks on lisdex, currently week 3 on 50mg.  
\- Many years on different SSRIs and SNRIs but currently on fluoxetine 20mg  
\- Some level of improved focus, difficulty ensuring focus is appropriately directed  
\- Can often be massively overstimulated/jittery/anxious  
\- Wondering if the potentiating effects of fluoxetine mean I should change my SSRI, or if I just need to reduce the lisdex dose, or none of the above.  
\- Wondering if lisdex is the right drug for me or if the negatives outweigh the positives",1,1758820902.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

1nqcsh3,https://i.redd.it/cbzssomfhcrf1.jpeg,Advice for traveling by airplane with a skateboard: Confirmed by Amsterdam Airport security,"This is not a question, but advice/tutorial for those who have this question on traveling by airplane and bringing a skateboard with you. 

I just finished my travel from Shanghai to Amsterdam (sipping coffee at Starbucks in Schiphol while writing this) with a couple of skateboard decks as carry-on luggage with not a single issue so far. 
The security at Shanghai airport looked very curious to the decks at first, but made no mention of it in terms of questionable size or security. 
Once I arrived in Amsterdam and went through the security check, the security officer in Amsterdam airport also made no mention of it. They only told me to carry the decks in hand through the body scanner. Except the person at the scanner had to run it thru the smaller scanner behind the x-ray machine. 

The security guy at the x-ray machine started talking how he, when he was a kid, had to disassemble his entire board for airplane travel. I just HAD to ask him and his manager directly what the rules are now, as I might be traveling with a complete skateboard (decks, trucks, wheels, etc) sometime in the future. They told me that the deck itself is no problem at all, but the trucks and all other parts need to be taken off and put in the check-in luggage. 

This really helped me confirm some things I’ve heard about traveling with a fully assembled board skateboard, and debunk some of the stories I’ve heard of people going thru security with a fully assembled skateboard and riding it to the gate. 

Naturally I have to say that this confirmation only applies to the Shanghai and Amsterdam airport. Other airports might, and most likely will, say something very different or very similar. But it remains a very grey area (as directly said by the Amsterdam security officer).

I decided that this year, they'd take the summer and reflect and change their ways. Obviously, I thought wrong. Last time I went there, they took literally 40 minutes to get anyone their food and then the orders were also wrong. Like when they put the bagels in the toaster, do they have a competition of who can snatch it out the fastest? Because every single time I go here without fail, my bagel is just warm not toasted. Okay whatever that's not that big a deal. I'll enjoy my warm bagel, if they can get a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese correct. Which they struggled to do last year but this year, they stepped it up. I've been a few times and my order has been correct and they hired some new people so they come out faster. The 40 minute wait time is now about 10 minutes. Today though, it all came crashing down. I go up to the counter, I've been thinking about this bagel all morning. I sat in my lecture basically drooling onto my keyboard thinking about it. I go in and I'm like ""can I get a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese?"". The workers face dropped and that's when I knew it was joever. The next words uttered out of her mouth sealed my fate and she said ""we are all out of normal cream cheese, I can get you loux, strawberry cream cheese, chives, vegetable cream cheese."" Bruh, I'm not feeling particularly fishy at 11am so I think I'll pass. How is it possible they were out of cream cheese so early? Obviously, I took it like a good boy and said strawberry cream cheese, and then suffered through a meal of bread for lunch after I cleaned that shit off. It's honestly just always something with this place, like why can they not function as a normal coffee shop. You know where I've never had this problem? Druthers. They always are going to do it right and it's honestly the same price as Peet's. So overpriced for what? For a strawberry cream cheese everything bagel that's been warmed to room temperature? Yeh no, this is strike 45 for Peet's. I'm going to give them one more chance, because I'm glutton for punishment and obviously a sucker for a lukewarm bagel.

A group of friends and I are going to be in Chicago for a four-day trip and I am looking for some recommendations for local and budget-friendly spots in the city. We've all been to Chicago before and have done all the touristy spots, and are looking to eat/drink like a local. As a reference point, we are staying in a hotel across the Riverwalk in the New Eastside.

Some details to help inform recommendations:

* Dietary restrictions: I am allergic to shellfish while one of my friends is vegetarian and lactose-intolerant.
* Coffee: My friends and I are coffee snob-ish. Local roasters or indie spots that you recommend?
* Types of food: We gravitate toward Mediterranean, Mexican, Indian, and Italian in most of our group dinners. But I wouldn't pass up specific recs for a good halal bowl or Chicago dog.
* Budget-friendly: Places that offer meals in the $10-20 range (before tip) are preferable!

Essentially, we just want to support local and hole-in-the-wall businesses during our visit. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you ❤️",0,1758820766.0,chicagofood,2,0.5,False

I was trying to rebuild myself, you know, hit the gym, eat better, maybe even read a self-help article or two. Everything was going fine… until I decided to scroll aimlessly online, because apparently that’s how grown-ups cope.

And then I saw it. Something that made me pause, laugh, and question the universe all at the same time. [DermDude](https://dermdude.com/) is running a Divorce Sale. Yep. You read that right. A full-on sale dedicated to divorced dudes. I nearly spilled my coffee laughing.

Curiosity got the best of me, so I clicked and found the Happy Sack Nut Love Cooling Ball Cream. I couldn’t resist. The name alone was enough to make me snort like a kid. And honestly? It works. Comfortable, refreshing, and somehow, it gave me this tiny, ridiculous little morale boost. Who knew self-care for your balls could feel this empowering after a breakup?

The whole thing is absurd, hilarious, and oddly practical. I’m lying there, half-laughing, half-questioning my life choices, realizing that maybe surviving a divorce isn’t just about pizza and bad movies, it’s also about small wins, like grabbing a product from a Divorce Sale that actually makes you feel… better.

So yeah, if you’ve recently been through the breakup gauntlet, or just want to see how absurdly funny life can get, check out this sale. It’s weird, it’s human, and honestly, it’s the kind of ridiculous thing that makes you shake your head and smile at the same time.",8,1758820717.0,men,0,1.0,False

I just want to say, this bread smell? I wanted to bite it so badly. It smells straight up like fresh baked bread. Incredible!

The scents from all of the slimes I received are so good. None of them are overpowering at all. My favorite scent in the whole order is Wet Hot Homosexual Summer. I have no idea what the scent is, but I want to smell it forever.

I've been a coffee enthusiast for over a decade now, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the perfect timing to buy a coffee grinder. Trust me, timing can make a huge difference in getting the best deal and the right product.

From my experience, the best time to purchase a coffee grinder is during major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day. I've noticed prices drop significantly during these periods, sometimes up to 40% off! But here's the thing - you don't always have to wait for these big sales.

I've found that many retailers, especially online stores like Amazon (check out some great options here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder), often have random flash sales throughout the year. Spring cleaning sales in March and April are particularly good times to snag a deal on kitchen appliances, including coffee grinders.

Here's something many people don't realize - January and February are actually fantastic months to buy a coffee grinder. Why? Because that's when stores are trying to clear out their holiday inventory, and new models are about to hit the shelves. I got my burr grinder during this period and saved almost $75!

Speaking of burr grinders, they're definitely worth the investment over blade grinders. The consistency in grind size makes a huge difference in your final brew. Whether you're into espresso, French press, or drip coffee, having the right grind size is crucial for that perfect cup.

If you're looking for specific recommendations, I've found some excellent deals here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. They have options for every budget and brewing style.

Some pro tips for buying:
- Read reviews from actual users
- Check the warranty period
- Consider the noise level (especially important for early morning brewing)
- Look at the capacity (do you brew for one or the whole family?)
- Think about counter space

Price tracking tools like CamelCamelCamel can be super helpful in monitoring price fluctuations. I've used it myself and it's amazing how much prices can vary throughout the year.

Remember, while timing your purchase is important, don't wait too long if you really need one. A good coffee grinder is an investment in your daily coffee routine, and fresh ground coffee is always worth it. Plus, you'll save money in the long run compared to buying pre-ground coffee or spending money at coffee shops.

It’s impossible to go to Denny’s and be healthy. I do usually go for the lumberjack slam. That is a banger. All that meat bro. There is ham in it. There is sausage. There is bacon. I get it a little crispy. Crispy bacon is always nice. I get coffee, I get it black. I’ve always been a black coffee guy. Well not always, I used to do lots of sugar.

1nqcj8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1nqcj8f/explore_if_mollys_suds_laundry_detergent_truly/,Explore If Molly's Suds Laundry Detergent Truly Delivers Clean,"The Molly's Suds 120-LAV-2PK laundry detergent has been part of my weekly cleaning routine for a couple of months now, and I’ve had plenty of opportunities to put it through its paces. As someone with sensitive skin and a preference for planet-friendly products, I was curious to see if this powder detergent would live up to all the hype. With its claim of clean, simple ingredients and a whopping 240-load capacity, I couldn’t wait to dive in and give it a try. Here’s how Molly's Suds performed and where it stood out—or fell short—in my experience.

**User-Friendly Packaging and Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the simple and straightforward design of the Molly's Suds packaging. It comes in two 79-ounce bags that are clearly labeled and include a handy measuring scoop. I found this a refreshing break from the overly complicated packaging of other detergents. Storing the bags on my laundry shelf was easy since they don’t take up a ton of space. The resealable feature is practical and helps keep the detergent fresh, though I did once find myself fiddling with it after spilling some powder due to my less-than-graceful hands.  

**Ease of Use in All Washers**  
One major plus of this detergent is its compatibility with all types of washing machines. I use a high-efficiency washer, and Molly's Suds worked like a charm in it. Unlike other powders that sometimes clump or don’t fully dissolve, this one did its job well without leaving any residue behind on my clothes. It’s also gentle on fabrics, even on my delicates. My friend who runs a small commercial laundry business tried it in her standard washer and reported similar spotless results. 

[Check Molly's Suds 120-LAV-2PK price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0d364343c/)

**Strengths**  
This laundry powder has so many features that make it a compelling choice:

- Contains only five simple, stain-fighting ingredients, making it safer for my health and eco-friendly.  
- Its gentle formula is ideal for families with sensitive skin and works well on most fabrics except silk and leather.
- Fragrance options include unscented or lightly scented (like Lavender), offering flexibility for those who prefer mild or no scent.  
- Septic and grey water safe, meaning it's suitable for environmentally conscious households like mine.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
No product is without its imperfections, and Molly’s Suds has a couple here and there:

- The powder sometimes struggles to dissolve fully in cold water unless I remember to premix it before adding it to the machine.  
- It’s not the best choice for families with heavier stains or messy kids without some added pre-treatment effort. I had to make a paste with the powder a few times to tackle stubborn marks.  
- The lavender scent, while pleasant, is very subtle—not ideal if you’re looking for a stronger fragrance to mask odors.

**Effectiveness as a Stain Remover**  
The concentrated formula here is designed to target tough stains, and while it works as promised for many light to moderate messes, it really shines when used with some extra prep. After an unfortunate coffee spill on my favorite sweatshirt, I followed their instructions (blotting, rinsing, and making a paste with the powder). The stain faded significantly after one cycle but wasn't entirely gone until a second run. So, while it does a solid job, it’s worth noting that the extra work for stubborn stains might deter those who want a quicker solution.

**Product Competitors**  
Looking at similar products on the market, Molly’s Suds definitely has stiff competition. For example, Arm & Hammer’s powder detergents are more budget-friendly, but they don’t offer the clean ingredient list Molly's Suds boasts. Another rival, Seventh Generation, matches Molly’s in eco-conscious formulation but tends to fall behind in the sheer number of loads per container. In terms of overall skin sensitivity, Molly's feels noticeably gentler, giving it a leg up for those with specific laundry needs. However, Tide’s powder detergent does a better job tackling heavily soiled clothes, particularly for athletic wear. Molly’s Suds wins on environmental considerations, but there’s a small trade-off in pure stain-lifting power.

**Bang for the Buck**  
When it comes to cost efficiency, this detergent delivers impressive value. With 240 loads packed into two bags, it works out to be exceptionally economical considering the high-quality ingredients. While there are cheaper options out there, this is one of those cases where spending a little more upfront pays off in gentler cleaning and a reduced environmental footprint. If affordability without compromising health or planet-friendliness is your priority, Molly’s Suds does justify its price tag.

- Text comments were cleaned, lower‑cased, stripped of punctuation and stop words, then converted to a TF‑IDF matrix.
- SelectKBest ranked features by correlation with the target rating, keeping only the top‑scoring variables alongside numeric descriptors such as acidity, body, and aroma intensity.
- Six algorithms were evaluated (Decision Tree, K‑Nearest Neighbors, Multi‑layer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost) with grid‑search hyperparameter tuning.
- Ensemble methods (Extra Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) and the MLP achieved the highest F1‑score, G‑mean, and AUC, outperforming Decision Tree and K‑NN.
- Feature selection and tuning reduced over‑fitting, improved model clarity, and enhanced generalisation to new review data.

Why it matters: The approach offers coffee producers and roasters a scalable tool to flag high‑quality beans quickly, complementing traditional cupping without replacing expert judgment.

Escitalopram/lexapro as a solution?,"Hi all. Trying to keep this brief but it'll inevitably be too long. Will stick a tl;dr at the bottom. Apologies in advance. Would really love some input though so massive thanks if you do read and reply.

I've been on lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse) for just over 2 months. 4 weeks I was on 30mg, then put up to 40mg for a week or so, and now 50mg for another two or three weeks. Previously tried methylphenidate and found it gave me very little positives and lots of negatives, so made the switch.  I also take fluoxetine (Prozac) 20mg daily for anxiety and depression.

So far, I honestly can't say if this is working for me or not. I *think* I experience positive effects - I think my focus is better, and I think I'm getting more done. But it's still not great. I'm still easily distracted; I can easily get stuck on the wrong task and struggle to switch to the right one. I don't seem to experience any 'calming' effects or any 'quietening' of the mind. I still have music playing in my head 90% of the time, my thoughts still race.

In addition there are quite a few negative effects. I have to be *very* careful with my diet, as if I don't have a big high-protein breakfast it sends me to space. The appetite suppression can make lunch challenging, which in turn can increase the intensity of the drug in the afternoon. I tolerate 30mg fairly well a lot of the time but don't see a huge improvement and it wears off quickly; 50mg helps me get more done, but the chance that I get overstimulated and panicky is much higher. There's quite a lot of variance in how it impacts me - some days I barely notice it, other days I feel so overstimulated, amped up and can't sit still. I feel angrier, my temper and my patience are shorter; there's a kind of apathy that's creeped in; I seem to only really want to spend time by myself; sometimes the crash in mid/late afternoon makes me feel pretty depressed.

The intensity and overstimulation made me wonder if perhaps the fluoxetine was interacting. And sure enough, turns out that fluoxetine inhibits the CYP2D6 enzyme, which can mean it potentiates the effects of lisdex.

The clinician from the ADHD clinic suggested I might want to swap the fluoxetine for a different SSRI which doesn't interact with the enzyme in question. A bit of research suggests either escitalopram (Lexapro) or sertraline (Zoloft) don't particularly interact with the CYP2D6 enzyme. Have tried sertraline previously and didn't enjoy the gastro side effects so thought I might try escitalopram (as citalopram previously worked reasonably well for me). I then went to my GP (PCP for the Americans); they consulted a psychiatrist, who said 1) they don't find that escitalopram is very effective, and most people in their experience don't like it, and 2) that I could achieve the same effect of changing the SSRI by instead just reducing the lisdex dose.

Long exposition. So my questions are:

\- Are you someone who takes an SSRI with your lisdex? Which one? Are you aware of any specific ways the drugs interact/the combination affects you?  
\- Are you someone who has switched from one SSRI to another while taking lisdex? How did that go? Positives/negatives?  
\- Is changing the lisdex dose likely to have the same effect as removing the SSRI? Or could there be a qualitative difference?  
\- Are you someone who relates to my experience with lisdex so far? Can you offer any guidance, advice, or hope?  
\- Any other suggestions? Any other thoughts?

Fundamentally, I think the issue here is that lisdex is not a magic wand and I haven't been able to solve all of my problems with ""one weird trick"". So part of the reason I'm posting this is probably just to vent. People talk about ADHD meds in such glowing terms, people tell you it's gonna change your life, and even though I tried very hard to manage my expectations, even though I knew this was a lot of hyperbole, it's still hard not to be disappointed. I'm tired of messing with my brain chemistry; I'm tired of not being able to trust how I feel about things in my life because I don't know how the drugs could be affecting things; I'm tired of waiting for things to settle and never ultimately feeling settled. I miss coffee.

Again if you read this far, sincere thanks. This sub is full of people complaining about their problems, and I don't love to add to that noise, but I haven't been able to get all the answers I'd hoped for just through reading.

Cheers x

tl;dr:  
\- 8 weeks on lisdex, currently week 3 on 50mg.  
\- Many years on different SSRIs and SNRIs but currently on fluoxetine 20mg  
\- Some level of improved focus, difficulty ensuring focus is appropriately directed  
\- Can often be massively overstimulated/jittery/anxious  
\- Wondering if the potentiating effects of fluoxetine mean I should change my SSRI, or if I just need to reduce the lisdex dose, or none of the above.  
\- Wondering if lisdex is the right drug for me or if the negatives outweigh the positives

I’ve been experimenting with different storage methods for my beans, and I’ve noticed a huge difference in flavor depending on how I store them. Some say airtight containers, some say freezer, and others swear by just keeping them in the bag they came in.

From my research ([and lots of trial and error](https://hotcoffeebrewing.com/how-to-store-coffee-beans-for-freshness/)), here’s what I’ve found works best for keeping beans fresh:

* Store them in **airtight, opaque containers** (no light, no air).
* Keep them in a **cool, dark place** (pantry > countertop).
* Avoid the fridge (moisture + odors kill the flavor).
* Freezer works **only if vacuum-sealed** and used in small batches.
* Buy in **small amounts** and grind right before brewing.

Since switching to airtight storage + small batches, my coffee tastes 10x fresher.

👉 What’s your go-to method for storing beans? Do you freeze them or stick to pantry storage?",1,1758820063.0,advisorcoffee,0,1.0,False

1nqcfb5,https://i.redd.it/z0gkhpexecrf1.png,When My Boyfriend Believed the Receptionist's Lies,"# Chapter 1 - The Unprofessional Receptionist

The hotel receptionist clearly had a massive crush on my boyfriend and decided to spill some major tea, aka spread nasty rumors about me, right there in front of everyone.

""This young lady was here with another man yesterday.""

""She even trashed the bedsheets when checking out and refused to pony up for the damage.""

""Oh, oops – did I say too much?""

""My bad, I just can't stand seeing you being played, Scott.""

I asked her to pull up the surveillance footage, but she totally ghosted me, claiming the cameras were down.

Little did she know, this five-star joint was actually my fam's.

""Hello, ma'am, how can I help you today?""

Even though she was talking to me, Jessica's eyes were glued to Scott.

I peeked at her name tag: Jessica Flores.

Funnily enough, I actually remembered this delicate-looking receptionist.

When Scott checked me in last night, she was the one who handled the whole registration process.

Back then, she was so starstruck by Scott that she straight-up knocked over a coffee mug.

After fumbling around to clean up her mess, it took her over ten minutes just to finish my check-in.

I’ve always known Scott has that… effect.

He’s tall, built like a Greek god, with that perfect fair skin and jawline.

His eyes, oh man, his eyes are pure magic – the kind that could make a traffic cone look like a supermodel.

It’s not uncommon for girls to give him the full-on stare-down, and I’ve never been bothered.

I mean, who doesn’t love a good-looking guy?

But this receptionist? Wasn't she pushing the boundaries of professional conduct?

""Hello, I checked out this morning and left a necklace on the bathroom counter.""

""Excuse me, did you even hear me?""

Scott and I had been together since college. Met at a party back in our senior year.

They say graduation season is basically breakup season.

Even though we went our separate ways for work and ended up in a long-distance relationship, our connection stayed solid.

This time, I was in town for a business trip, and Scott suggested I crash at his place. But with his parents and grandparents all under one roof, I felt kinda weird about staying over before marriage, especially with the whole fam giving me the side-eye.

So, Scott booked me a room at the only five-star hotel in the city.

I checked out super early this morning. It wasn't until after brunch with Scott, when I was about to head home, that I realized my necklace was missing.

I had to practically wave my hand in front of the receptionist's face to snap her out of her daze. She blushed as she finally turned her attention to me.

She glanced at her computer screen and replied without missing a beat:

""I'm so sorry, ma'am, but housekeeping already cleaned your room this morning and reported no lost items. Are you absolutely sure you didn't misplace it somewhere else?""

I was honestly taken aback.

Earlier, while I was doing my hair in the mirror, a stray strand got all tangled up in my necklace.

I took it off and set it down right there. Just as I finished styling my hair and reached for the necklace, my phone buzzed.

A client I was supposed to meet had arrived earlier than scheduled.

In a mad dash, I grabbed my bag and bolted, only remembering the necklace after I’d nailed the deal.

""I'm positive I left it on the bathroom counter. Could you possibly check with the housekeeping staff again?""

Instead of picking up the phone, the receptionist doubled down, her tone firm:

""Nothing's been logged in our lost and found. You must be mistaken.""

Seeing my frown, Scott stepped in, taking my hand.

""Don't stress, try to retrace your steps.""

""Maybe you dropped it somewhere on the way out?""

# Chapter 2 - The Accusation

I was getting seriously cheesed.

What was he implying? Did he think I’d messed up the details?

I was 100% sure about my necklace—it was chilling on the bathroom counter.

That diamond stunner was a birthday gift from my mom last month, worth a cool fortune.

“Don’t hotels have cameras in the lobby and elevators? Get them to pull the footage.”

“We’ll know for sure if I was wearing it when I left once we see it.”

Scott let out a breath he’d been holding and nudged the front desk staff with me.

“Yeah, great idea.”

“Please, have someone check the recordings.”

The front desk clerk froze, her eyes doing a frantic dance. She gnawed on her lip, giving me this super weird look.

“Ma’am, is it possible your… companion took it?”

Both Scott and I did a double-take.

Scott’s face went dark, and he zeroed in on her. “Companion? What companion?”

The clerk spilled it out, “The gentleman who was with you yesterday.”

“You checked out first this morning, and he checked out an hour later.”

“When the housekeeper did her rounds, she found… stains all over the sheets.”

“Hotel policy says he owed a cleaning fee, but he totally refused to pay and kicked up a huge fuss.”

Scott was losing it. His face flushed crimson, and his voice shot up. “What gentleman? Where did this guy even come from?”

I was fuming harder than he was.

What was wrong with this clerk? Last night, I’d been deep in contract revisions until 3 AM. Like, where would I have even found the time for a guy?

What kind of BS was she spitting?

And what was this about stained sheets?

I gave her a glacial stare. “You’re legally liable for what you say. Now, tell me again—what man was in my room yesterday?”

The clerk visibly flinched, like she’d been caught. “M-maybe I got it wrong.”

Scott pulled me aside, jaw clenched, shooting me a death glare. “Valerie, stop intimidating her.”

Then he turned back to the clerk, plastering on a smile. “Take your time, no need to be scared.”

Jessica Flores nervously dropped her gaze, her voice deliberately softening. “W-we’re not supposed to share guest info.”

“I’m so sorry, just pretend I misspoke.”

I was so mad I felt lightheaded, a hot wave washing over me.

Scott was not doing any better.

His eyes were bloodshot, his chest heaving like a bellows.

“Valerie, is this why you wouldn’t stay at my place?”

“No wonder you didn’t pick up my video call last night.”

“So that’s it… that’s the whole story…”

“Who is he?”

Scott didn’t trust me.

Some random person shows up, spews some wild story, and he’s instantly questioning our relationship, my character, everything.

I just stared at him, feeling like a bucket of ice water had just been dumped over my head.

My heart felt like it was being crushed in a vice, an ache of bitter sorrow blooming.

In Scott’s eyes, was I really that kind of person?

Came to my boyfriend’s city for work, and secretly booked a hotel room with another guy?

Then, the next day, acted like nothing happened and met him for lunch?

We're trying to make the best use of our time by mixing travel with spending a few days in some key places. My wife is mostly after ""Fairy vibes"" and castles and I'm after pubs and history.

  
The plan is to fly into Dublin and spend a day taking cabs around the city to get an idea for how the roads work before we pick up a rental car, I've driven right hand drive before, but never on the other side of the road. The big question I have is if anybo dy has ever been to the Glenarm Tulip festival? My wife is insistent on going, so it's in the list, but if we weren't going we probably wouldn't go to Northern Irleand at all this trip since.

1nqcacv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1nqcacv/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy Worth Buying?,"Testing out the ZWILLING Enfinigy 1-Liter Electric Kettle was like stepping into a small slice of modern German-engineered genius. The first time I used it, I couldn’t help but appreciate how elegantly it fit into my kitchen routine—sleek, compact, and designed with precision. This kettle's aesthetic and functionality create a seamless experience, especially for anyone who values both form and practicality in their appliances.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The electric kettle's double-walled stainless steel design immediately caught my eye. Its polished silver exterior gives it a modern and minimalist appeal that looks fantastic on my countertop. Beyond the looks, the double-wall structure ensures that while the water inside stays hot, the outside remains cool to the touch. This feature felt reassuring, especially with my clumsy tendencies and the curious hands of my two kids often around. The 70-degree lid opening was another detail I hadn’t anticipated loving—it prevents steam from hitting your hand directly, and honestly, I don’t get why this isn’t standard on all kettles! Even after daily use for several weeks, there’s no evidence of wear, and it’s incredibly easy to clean, thanks to the seamless interior.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Using the kettle is remarkably straightforward, but it's not just about simplicity—it’s about how efficiently it tackles its job. Boiling water for my morning coffee or a soothing chamomile tea before bed takes mere moments. Compared to my old standard kettle, this cordless electric one is impressively quick without making that loud, annoying hum. I tested its performance several times with various tasks, and the results were consistently efficient. Plus, no spillage or dribbles thanks to its well-designed spout.  

[Check ZWILLING Enfinigy 1-Liter Electric Kettle price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b09x6bhbfq/)  

**Upsides**  
There’s a lot to like here, but some of its standout features include:  
- The double-walled design keeps water hot longer while ensuring the exterior stays safe to touch.  
- Its sleek, stainless steel construction makes it durable and easy to maintain.  
- The 70-degree lid opening minimizes steam-related mishaps.  
- Fast and quiet operation is a major plus for early mornings when everyone else is still asleep.  

**Shortcomings**  
While I came to appreciate most aspects of this kettle, a few areas didn’t resonate as perfectly:  
- The 1-liter capacity is sufficient for a couple of cups, but it might fall short for larger families needing more boiling water at once.  
- There’s no water level indicator on the outside, which feels like an odd omission.  
- The bright, polished exterior smudges easily, so expect frequent wiping if fingerprints bother you.

**Product Alternatives**  
I’ve tested a few electric kettles in the past, and though this one stands out in design and safety, there are some worthy competitors for specific needs. For instance, brands like Breville and Cuisinart have options that offer larger capacities, and some even include variable temperature settings for tea enthusiasts who need precise water temperatures. While the ZWILLING kettle excels in staying cool to the touch and looking chic, others may win in versatility or sheer volume. Choosing between them would depend on whether you prioritize appearance and safety or advanced functionality.

**True Value**  
Coming to the matter of investment, this kettle feels worth every penny for its engineering, safety features, and sleek aesthetics. It operates at a premium level and certainly justifies its cost if the goal is a reliable, stylish, and safe electric kettle. I wouldn’t recommend it specifically for budget-conscious shoppers, given there are cheaper models out there, but its quality makes it a smarter buy for long-term use.

1nqc9v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1nqc9v6/essayshark_review_2025_i_tried_it_so_you_dont/,EssayShark Review (2025): I Tried It So You Don’t Have To,"Okay y’all, let’s talk. I had one of those weeks—two deadlines, zero energy, and a brain running purely on coffee ☕. I needed help fast, so I ended up trying EssayShark. I’d seen the name pop up on Google before and figured it was worth a shot. This is my honest EssayShark review, based on actually ordering a paper, plus my take on whether EssayShark is legit.

Spoiler: it wasn’t great 😬. I ended up switching to Killer Papers instead (100x better, tbh).

TL;DR: EssayShark gave me a rushed, awkward paper that I couldn’t turn in as-is. Switched to Killer Papers and haven’t looked back 🚀.

Why I Picked EssayShark in the First Place 🤔

It was one of those nights when everything hits at once—assignments stacking up, my part-time job running late, and me staring at my laptop in full panic mode. I searched “essay help online,” and EssayShark was everywhere.

The website itself looked polished, with big promises about quick turnaround, “professional writers,” and customer reviews plastered all over the page. In my stressed-out state, it felt like a safe bet.

Turns out… not so much.

My Actual Experience with EssayShark 😐

Ordering was straightforward: I uploaded my prompt, set the deadline, and made the payment. For a brief second, I felt relieved, thinking the problem was solved. That relief disappeared once I actually got the essay back.

Here’s what stood out about my EssayShark experience:

Grammar & Flow: The writing was clunky 📝, almost like the writer wasn’t fluent in English. It didn’t sound natural at all, and I immediately worried it would raise red flags with my professor.
Citations: Total disaster 📑. I specifically asked for APA format, but what I got was some bizarre mash-up of MLA, APA, and random footnotes. Definitely not usable.
Content Quality: The essay was filled with fluff 💨. Instead of actual analysis, it felt like copy-pasted summaries from basic sources. There was no depth, and it didn’t really address the specifics of my assignment.
Revisions: I asked for a revision, hoping it would improve things. Unfortunately, the “revised” paper was basically the same one with a few words swapped. No major fixes, no real improvement.
I ended up staying up until 3 AM rewriting more than half the paper myself just to make it passable. Honestly, it was the exact opposite of what I’d hoped for when I ordered.

So… is EssayShark legit? Technically, yes. They’ll give you something. But based on my EssayShark review, the quality just isn’t there, and it’s not worth relying on them for anything serious.

Why I Switched to Killer Papers 🔥

After that mess, I decided I needed a different option. I saw a bunch of people on Reddit recommend Killer Papers, and I noticed one big difference right away: they only use North American writers. No outsourcing, no AI-generated stuff, just actual humans who understand college-level writing.

When I tried Killer Papers, the experience felt totally different:

✅ The writer actually DM’d me to ask about my class level and tone (super important, because it made the paper sound like something I could’ve written).

✅ The essay had a smooth, natural flow 🌊 instead of awkward, broken grammar.

✅ The research was legit, with proper citations 📚 that matched exactly what I asked for.

✅ The formatting was perfect, and the paper was Turnitin-safe ✅.

Yeah, it cost a little more 💵, but honestly, the peace of mind and quality were worth it. Instead of rewriting half the paper, I could just turn it in and focus on other assignments.

Final Thoughts 💡

If you’re considering EssayShark, here’s my honest take: be careful ⚠️. Maybe it’s fine for super basic assignments where quality doesn’t matter much, but if your grade is on the line, I wouldn’t risk it.

My EssayShark review boils down to this: they’ll deliver a paper, but it’s low-quality, awkwardly written, and full of mistakes. In my opinion, EssayShark is not worth it ❌.

On the flip side, Killer Papers has been my go-to ever since. Every paper I’ve gotten has been reliable, well-written, and stress-free. The writers actually care about making it sound natural and polished.

If you’re debating between EssayShark and Killer Papers, my advice is simple: skip the headaches and go with KP from the start. Trust me, your sleep and sanity will thank you 🌟.",1,1758819697.0,studytips,4,1.0,False

1nqc8e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictoLove/comments/1nqc8e1/the_family_chosen_makeela_riju/,The Family Chosen (Makeela Riju),"I boarded the bus and chose the only seat that was completely empty. I sat down and scooted towards the window, putting my bag on the seat beside me. I looked out the window watching classmates get on their respective school busses while trying to ignore the din of the bus I was on coming from the other kids. Usually Mokoto picks me up but I received a text from him that he was held up at work due to an unexpected driver’s meeting.

“Makeela?” a girl’s voice broke my concentration of shutting out the noise and I turned to see a girl with long blond hair and blues eyes looking at me expectantly.

“Oh hey Zelda.” I greeted my friend and next door neighbor as I moved my bag to the floor so she could sit down.

“It’s not often I see you on the bus.” She said as she took a seat getting her stuff out of the way for any last minute boarding since the buses were about to leave. “Mokoto still working then?”

“Yeah.” I said. 

“At least our stop is one of the first few.” She said optimistically. “Do you want to hang out at my house till he arrives?”

“I would like to, but Shade needs to be taken care of.” I responded referring to the dog that adopted me and Mokoto as his family. I myself found kinship with the dog as I myself am a foster child with Mokoto being my foster parent though at this point I’ve seen him as my actual father since I was raised by my late mother and my actual father never bothered to stick around after he was given the news of me being conceived.

“Oh right.” Zelda said realizing that we had a dog. “Is he really a wolf? Or is he a husky?”

“The vets are convinced he’s a wolf.” I said remembering them breaking the news that a undomesticated animal had chosen us as its pack. a couple of months ago.

We tried at first to have DNR reintroduce him back into the wild but he returned a day or two later. Luckily for us, Mokoto got special permission to keep him though it took alot of convincing with the social worker. Surprisingly enough, Shade got along with anyone for the most part but he really bonded with me.

“That’s amazing. He must be an Alexander Archipelago given the pattern and color scale of his coat.” Zelda said as she went into one of her analytical monologues as she does when something fascinates her academic mind. I let her have her monologue as I don’t mind them but she stopped herself short realizing she was doing it. “Oh! Sorry, Makeela.”

“That’s okay.” I reassured her that I wasn’t bothered.

“It just fascinates me that.. Oh it looks like this our stop.”

I looked and sure enough she was right. We both go off the bus and started walking towards our houses. As we did Zelda continued her pondering. “As I was saying, I find it fascinating that a wolf with seemingly no prior interaction with humans before decided to just show up and start living with you two. I mean wolves aren’t all the same and similar accounts of different animals have been known to come to pass, but this is still rare to happen.”

“Yeah.” I responded since I still was amazed by it even though he’s been living with us for two months now as if he always lived there. “The vets say we’re lucky he’s practically still a wolf cub because there’s time to socialize him and train him to be not as feral as he could be.”

“I know!” Zelda agreed enthusiastically.

“Would you like to say hi to him?” I offered since I knew they get along and she has to pass my house to get to hers.

“I’d love to!” She replied excitedly but her face turned from excited to concerned as she faced the direction of our houses. “Um Makeela? It seems you have a visitor.”

I looked and saw the unmistakable Prius in our driveway and on the front porch, was the familiar woman with red hair in a tight high ponytail. She stood a towering seven feet and she was very muscular. She was wearing her signature horn rimmed glasses and a business suit and pants. She had her arms crossed and watching as no doubt Shade was barking at her. Buliara, the social worker assigned to my case, was here.

“Sorry, Zelda.” I said dreading what was to come. “Could you wait till later?”

“Oh no problem.” She said as she gave me a side hug and sprinted off ahead.

Buliara glanced her way then back up the road to spot me, dawning a face of sudden realization before quickly resetting to her “all business” face. “That would explain why no one answered the door yet.” she said.

“Can you let me let shade outside before we do this?” I asked

“Of course.” She agreed. “Where’s Mokoto?”

As soon as she asked that, my phone went off. I checked the message and, speak of the devil, it was him saying, “ETA 10mn”

I texted, “CPS is here.”

He immediately replied, “Make that seven.”

I turned to Buliara and responded, “He’ll be here shortly.”

She nodded in response and wrote something on the clipboard she was carrying. I unlocked the door and managed to get the excited canine of mine outside where he started sniffing around as if it was new territory. I explained the house on my way back to the front door and mentally thanked my lucky star we cleaned the place yesterday. I let Buliara in and she started her inspection on the house. As she toured the house making notes as she went, she would ask candid questions either about how things were run. She seemed to catch a particular interest in the wall where all the candid pictures of me, Mokoto, and my foster siblings who were adopted a while ago were. Most of them she’d seen on her previous visits but it has been a half a year since her last visit.

“So you took some martial arts classes?” Buliara asked pointing a picture of me accepting my black belt.

“Yes. Taekwondo.” I replied nonchalantly as I knew she wasn’t asking to make conversation.

She wrote a few more notes on her clipboard and moved on. As we were about to take a seat in the living room, Shade barked the arrival of Mokoto as I also heard the tell tale sound of his diesel pickup. Pulling into the driveway and into the garage. Buliara and I looked at the door that lead to the garage in waiting for him to walk through the door. When he did, he definitely looked like it was a long day. He clomped through the house in his boots lugging his lunchbox and travel coffee mug into the kitchen after greeting us and assuring that he would join us in just a few seconds. I heard him plop his stuff down on the table and return to the living room and took a seat in his recliner. “Hey.” He simply said greeting is again.

“Hello, Mr. Diver. We toured the house in your absence,” Buliara started to explain, “It has meet the standards although some improvements could be made but not worth noting. It seems that you two have a handle on things as a certain canine is concerned.”

Mokoto leaned forward in his chair digesting her words not breaking eye contact with her. “However my usual check up isn’t the only reason why I have come.”

As we both gave her inquisitive looks, she explained, “It has been brought to my attention that a suitable house has been found for you Makeela.”

I could have sworn I temporarily died then and there. Not from delight that I might finally be adopted, but the fact that I might no longer live in this place I have come to know as home. I looked over to Mokoto who was no longer making eye contact with anyone but the ground. It was clear to me at least he was shaken by this news too. And that was saying something since the oaf rarely showed signs of sadness or grief.

“I have the portfolio right here.” Buliara emotionlessly said as she gathered a file from her clipboard and handed it to Mokoto who took it from her, his arms shaking. He slowly opened it and started reading.

I was about to lash out verbally at Buliara for not giving us the time to digest the news but Mokoto must have sensed my rising ire and gave me a pleading look as to not make this any harder. I complied for his sake and the fact I had final say, and was set on refusing to even look at the file.

Buliara and I watched in silence as he went front what seemed to be a shaken man on the verge of breaking to stone silence. He displayed no emotion except for slight bewilderment as he continued to read only breaking his concentration once to first look at Buliara who gave him a silent nod in return, glanced my way then continued reading. Unable to take it anymore, I asked, “Who is it?”

He looked at me, finally breaking his gaze from the file as he closed and handed it to me. His arm wasn’t shaking as badly but the. tension was still there. I couldn’t even keep to my decision to refuse to look as my curiosity got the better of me and it wouldn’t hurt to look any way. I swear I was mimicking Mokoto as it was my turn to see what was lying behind the file. I opened it and peaked at the name of the document on top.

In the space for the name… it was “Mokoto Diver”. I was confused. I skimmed the page trying to find the name of the family I was supposedly matched with, but there wasn’t any.  I looked at the title of the document, and sure enough, it was the documented dossier of the family applicant. For a brief moment I was speechless, but finally I stuttered, “I don’t understand.”

“You’re fourteen now Makeela. It’s for the best you be put in a permanent home before you’re aged out of the foster program. And given how well you two get along with each other as if you were actual family, I couldn’t imagine a better candidate.”

Tears started to build up in my eyes. I made eye contact with Buliara and started to ask, “Then…”

“Then how come I’ve been an emotionless buzzkill?” She asked with a disarming look of both happiness and a knowing glance I thought her unable to make.

“I didn’t…” I explained trying to divert any hint she read my mind or knew what I’d thought of her the last few years but she interrupted again.

“Makeela, believe it or not, I was hoping this would be your permanent home as much as the two of you were. Even before he filed the request to.” She explained pointing at (plenty-diver). “But given my position, I had to keep things in a professional and unattached light to make sure this was indeed a wise decision not based on my total opinion. I do want the kids I am tasked with to find their home. It’s why I became a social worker after all. But I have to ask you, do you think you could call this place home?”

I practically launched out of my chair at Mokoto,  he must have anticipated this and stood up, bracing himself with his arms open as I gave my new-ish father a hug. I couldn’t even try to hold back my tears of joy. He returned the hug in kind practically keeping me off the ground as his arms wrapped around me. A minute later we were still hugging but I heard Buliara, who I forgot was there, say, “I’ll just leave these here and we can finalize things Wednesday.”

I was too emotionally tired myself to respond but luckily I didn’t have to as I felt dad’s torso swivel towards her direction and thanked her. Heard the doo open and shut, and a few minutes later her car driving away. We didn’t let go for even a few more minutes after that but dad did lower me enough that I was touching the ground again. “I love you, dad.” I finally managed to say.”

He pulled back enough to kiss the top of my head and said, “I love you too, Makeela.”

I chucked asking, “What happened to calling me ‘Short Stack’?” I lightly teased him.

“I still have a few years left to call you that.” He assured me.

I was diagnosed with ADHD a month ago, but it took a while to actually get medication. I started Vyvanse (10mg, which I hear is low?) this Tuesday.

Tuesday:

Ate a good breakfast, took it a little later (9:30) so I wouldn’t crash mid-workday... maybe a mistake?

Avoided coffee, snacked throughout the day. Had a full lunch of chicken vegetable and bean soup.

Positive: my brain went quiet right away. I was still distracted but the thoughts weren’t constant.

It didn’t last long though. Around 1pm my mood was better but I got bored, stopped focusing, and had a headache most of the day.

Big dinner, went for a walk, then night hit… and I did not sleep. At all.

Wednesday:

Took it early (7am) since people said you can take it and go back to bed.

Ate half a breakfast sandwich later, had some yogurt, tons of water, no caffeine. But I was peeing every 15 minutes.

Got my period this day too.

By 11am I had crashed so hard I was falling asleep at my desk, almost slurring my words in a meeting.

Migraine started by 12:30 and I was completely useless. By 4pm I was dry heaving from the headache, freezing, couldn’t function.

My partner made pizza which I ate, plus Gatorade and more water. 

Passed out when I finally got to bed.

Thursday (today):

Woke up late with a nasty headache. Still feel like the meds are swimming around in me.

Didn’t take Vyvanse because I feel bedridden and scared to repeat yesterday.

I want to try again tomorrow but I’m nervous. Thinking I should eat more protein in the morning and drink even more water, but right now I just feel terrible.

It’s hard to see the other side of this when I feel so crappy. :( Has anyone else had a first week like this?",1,1758819528.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False
1nqc71w,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictoHeartbound/comments/1nqc71w/the_family_chosen_makeela_riju/,The Family Chosen (Makeela Riju),"I boarded the bus and chose the only seat that was completely empty. I sat down and scooted towards the window, putting my bag on the seat beside me. I looked out the window watching classmates get on their respective school busses while trying to ignore the din of the bus I was on coming from the other kids. Usually Mokoto picks me up but I received a text from him that he was held up at work due to an unexpected driver’s meeting.

“Makeela?” a girl’s voice broke my concentration of shutting out the noise and I turned to see a girl with long blond hair and blues eyes looking at me expectantly.

“Oh hey Zelda.” I greeted my friend and next door neighbor as I moved my bag to the floor so she could sit down.

“It’s not often I see you on the bus.” She said as she took a seat getting her stuff out of the way for any last minute boarding since the buses were about to leave. “Mokoto still working then?”

“Yeah.” I said. 

“At least our stop is one of the first few.” She said optimistically. “Do you want to hang out at my house till he arrives?”

“I would like to, but Shade needs to be taken care of.” I responded referring to the dog that adopted me and Mokoto as his family. I myself found kinship with the dog as I myself am a foster child with Mokoto being my foster parent though at this point I’ve seen him as my actual father since I was raised by my late mother and my actual father never bothered to stick around after he was given the news of me being conceived.

“Oh right.” Zelda said realizing that we had a dog. “Is he really a wolf? Or is he a husky?”

“The vets are convinced he’s a wolf.” I said remembering them breaking the news that a undomesticated animal had chosen us as its pack. a couple of months ago.

We tried at first to have DNR reintroduce him back into the wild but he returned a day or two later. Luckily for us, Mokoto got special permission to keep him though it took alot of convincing with the social worker. Surprisingly enough, Shade got along with anyone for the most part but he really bonded with me.

“That’s amazing. He must be an Alexander Archipelago given the pattern and color scale of his coat.” Zelda said as she went into one of her analytical monologues as she does when something fascinates her academic mind. I let her have her monologue as I don’t mind them but she stopped herself short realizing she was doing it. “Oh! Sorry, Makeela.”

“That’s okay.” I reassured her that I wasn’t bothered.

“It just fascinates me that.. Oh it looks like this our stop.”

I looked and sure enough she was right. We both go off the bus and started walking towards our houses. As we did Zelda continued her pondering. “As I was saying, I find it fascinating that a wolf with seemingly no prior interaction with humans before decided to just show up and start living with you two. I mean wolves aren’t all the same and similar accounts of different animals have been known to come to pass, but this is still rare to happen.”

“Yeah.” I responded since I still was amazed by it even though he’s been living with us for two months now as if he always lived there. “The vets say we’re lucky he’s practically still a wolf cub because there’s time to socialize him and train him to be not as feral as he could be.”

“I know!” Zelda agreed enthusiastically.

“Would you like to say hi to him?” I offered since I knew they get along and she has to pass my house to get to hers.

“I’d love to!” She replied excitedly but her face turned from excited to concerned as she faced the direction of our houses. “Um Makeela? It seems you have a visitor.”

I looked and saw the unmistakable Prius in our driveway and on the front porch, was the familiar woman with red hair in a tight high ponytail. She stood a towering seven feet and she was very muscular. She was wearing her signature horn rimmed glasses and a business suit and pants. She had her arms crossed and watching as no doubt Shade was barking at her. Buliara, the social worker assigned to my case, was here.

“Sorry, Zelda.” I said dreading what was to come. “Could you wait till later?”

“Oh no problem.” She said as she gave me a side hug and sprinted off ahead.

Buliara glanced her way then back up the road to spot me, dawning a face of sudden realization before quickly resetting to her “all business” face. “That would explain why no one answered the door yet.” she said.

“Can you let me let shade outside before we do this?” I asked

“Of course.” She agreed. “Where’s Mokoto?”

As soon as she asked that, my phone went off. I checked the message and, speak of the devil, it was him saying, “ETA 10mn”

I texted, “CPS is here.”

He immediately replied, “Make that seven.”

I turned to Buliara and responded, “He’ll be here shortly.”

She nodded in response and wrote something on the clipboard she was carrying. I unlocked the door and managed to get the excited canine of mine outside where he started sniffing around as if it was new territory. I explained the house on my way back to the front door and mentally thanked my lucky star we cleaned the place yesterday. I let Buliara in and she started her inspection on the house. As she toured the house making notes as she went, she would ask candid questions either about how things were run. She seemed to catch a particular interest in the wall where all the candid pictures of me, Mokoto, and my foster siblings who were adopted a while ago were. Most of them she’d seen on her previous visits but it has been a half a year since her last visit.

“So you took some martial arts classes?” Buliara asked pointing a picture of me accepting my black belt.

“Yes. Taekwondo.” I replied nonchalantly as I knew she wasn’t asking to make conversation.

She wrote a few more notes on her clipboard and moved on. As we were about to take a seat in the living room, Shade barked the arrival of Mokoto as I also heard the tell tale sound of his diesel pickup. Pulling into the driveway and into the garage. Buliara and I looked at the door that lead to the garage in waiting for him to walk through the door. When he did, he definitely looked like it was a long day. He clomped through the house in his boots lugging his lunchbox and travel coffee mug into the kitchen after greeting us and assuring that he would join us in just a few seconds. I heard him plop his stuff down on the table and return to the living room and took a seat in his recliner. “Hey.” He simply said greeting is again.

“Hello, Mr. Diver. We toured the house in your absence,” Buliara started to explain, “It has meet the standards although some improvements could be made but not worth noting. It seems that you two have a handle on things as a certain canine is concerned.”

Mokoto leaned forward in his chair digesting her words not breaking eye contact with her. “However my usual check up isn’t the only reason why I have come.”

Hello all. I’ve been struggling with caffine for awhile now and it’s gotten entirely out of hand. I feel trapped and I’m looking for any and all tips, no matter how ridiculous, that got you through the first several weeks of either cutting back or quitting entirely.

I have an addictive personality. I’ve struggled with alcohol addiction in the past and giving up caffeine has been far harder. Every night I tell myself I won’t have too much, and then every morning I do. I have an addicts level of self-discipline, which is to say essentially none, and I’m tired of being constantly disappointed in myself for setting goals and immediately breaking them the next day.

I’m not prepared to quit full turkey as I know I won’t be able to function in school or work with the headaches I’ll deal with (I know from experience) so I’ve been working on tapering but tapering always becomes binging. Give an inch, take a mile. My favorite drinks are also highly concentrated in caffeine (cold brew being my fave) and I’ll easily have 3 cups of it in a morning if I can.

And of course I get massive anxiety and heart palpitations and you’d think that would make me stop but I just try to medicate with weed or my xanax to offset the anxiety in the name of being “fully caffeinated”

So to make a long story even fucking longer, I’m begging for help. As someone who relies on little things to look forward to (treats, snacks, a couple hours playing video games) to get through life, I’m desperate to have something to look forward to in the morning like I do coffee. (and for the record I cannot stand the taste of decaf coffee) I can’t be trusted with coffee and certainly shouldn’t be around energy drinks. I’m weak and constantly failing myself when I set boundaries.

How did those of you that taper go about it? And how did you deal with the incredibly strong urge to have something caffeinated every time you’re a little tired when your body probably just needs water? What do you do when the chemical urge is so strong that it’s physical? If you can’t tell by the desperation in the post, I’m in too deep and I need HELP yall. ",3,1758819211.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

1nqc1kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1nqc1kk/religious_trauma/,Religious Trauma,"I am unsure of where to start with this but I am looking for some insight, advice, support, etc. 

Backstory, me and my man have been together for 8.5 years including our dating period, we are high school sweethearts. We have a 7 month old daughter. When we met (16 & 17), he opened up about religious trauma when he was younger. He was forced to go to church multiple times a week which led to him not having a normal childhood, not being able to do certain things. His mother was very forceful about going to church and never gave an option, so he and his sisters would act sick or find a different excuse. His parents divorced before he was even 1, and he has 2 older sisters. His sisters were not the greatest influence to him and I do feel caused some havoc with going to church and influencing him on certain matters, which I feel has affected him to this day. They are both liberals and I would say heavily involved with the New Age. They definitely are not believers. My husband on the other hand is conservative and says that he believes in God, but hasn't really given me much more than that. He is a wonderful man, and I love him dearly. He is a great father and takes care of us well. We follow traditional roles in our home and share the same core values which is important to the both of us. 

Now some info on me. I grew up in a Christian family, my parents never took me or my sister to church, but when we would visit our grandparents we would attend on Sundays and Wednesdays until we were of age to decide if we wanted to go or not. I was still on the younger side and knew of Jesus but was not saved or baptized. In high school, I drifted away from that, as I made the decision not to attend church. I did go once with a friend, but it did not stick. In Summer 2023, is when I began to find my faith in my adult life and bought my first Bible. I started doing studies with my friend and she has taught me so much. We were not married at this time, but my husband never made me feel bad for doing this. I feel like it was more so he just didn't understand why.

My faith has grown since but has definitely been a rollecoaster. My friend started to invite me to church in Fall 2024, which is when I was in the middle of my pregnancy. Me and my husband talked and he said that once our daughter was born, if I was still going to church that I can take her. I stopped going to church at the end of 2024 because I used to the pregnancy excuse (bad I know, I wish I could go back and change it). And just this past Sunday, was my first time back in church. I do feel the CK incident pushed me to go back which it shouldn't have taken that to get me to go back, but needless to say I am happy I went and ripped the bandaid off again.

This is where I am looking for the insight and support. On Saturday, we went to bed completely normal and did not have any disagreements or anything. I was up first on Sunday, and made coffee and breakfast and he woke up in a mood. I had an idea of why he might be feeling that way but I continued on with my morning. I started to get anxious about going to back to church but remained stoic. I got me and my daughter ready and went to go kiss my husband goodbye. I said ""I love you"" and he just said ""bye"" (which rarely happens. If it does it is for a reason) until I looked at him alitte longer then got a ""I love you"". I tried to brush it off which I did because my anxiety was really high and I was just trying to think about how I will get through a service with a 7 month old who has already been up for 2+ hours and probably will not fall asleep (which she didn't lol). On my drive he texted me, he asked why I can't find a church near us. (My church is only 20 minutes away) I told him I know this church and haven't looked into closer churches and left it at that because I was still driving then he texted lol which he does not do normally only if he is feeling some type of way. I just told him we arrived and left it at that. I get through the service, get home and we didn't discuss what was said, and I didn't want to come off as a quarrelsome wife so I just kept going on throughout the day and it did get better. 

But that conversation and his attitude sat with me until last night when I finally asked him why he was being mean to me on Sunday. He said he wasn't but I asked him again and he finally said because it reminded him of his childhood. So I asked him are you going to do that everytime? I am not sure if that was the right thing to say but it was left at that and we continued with dinner and our evening as normal. We are fine this morning. we haven't fought . But I can't understand for the life of me how I triggered him. He's done a couple things in the past few months, where I thought he was coming to Christ on his own. We went shopping the weekend before last and he told me he could see me wearing a shirt that he found. It said faith over fear with a crown of thorns on the front. I ended up buying it and have worn it since. But the church thing came out of left field. I don't know if I remind him of his mom even though I try to not do ""motherly"" things for him. That is something that I have been working on since we have been together. I never forced him with his faith or to pursue it or to go to church. I have prayed for him that he has an encounter with God. I don't know if he is scared that our daughter will grow up the same way he did and she'll have to deal with this in the future. I don't know. I am maybe looking to see if anyone else has stories of people with religous trauma coming to Christ eventually or just words of wisdom. I've prayed for him, not as much as I should be honestly. My prayer life is lacking overall. But I dedicated my journal entry to him this morning. This incident has not changed my mind about going to church, just trying to get an outside perspective.

1nqc11i,https://i.redd.it/rfv8x5x4ccrf1.png,Too Late For Regret: The Genius Heiress Who Shines,"Chapter 1 Let's Divorce

The night before their third wedding anniversary, Cary Gibson emerged victorious from a high-end auction, securing a pair of rare sapphire earrings.



He said softly, ""This is for the person I owe the most--my beloved.""



From home, his wife, Evelina Marsh, felt tears pooling as she watched the auction on television. Tomorrow was their third anniversary, and maybe, at long last, Cary had realized her devotion.



Cary's grandmother, Demi Gibson, exhaled in quiet satisfaction. ""At long last, Cary's learned how valuable his wife truly is.""



The next evening, Evelina had barely set the finishing touches on an extravagant dinner when Cary stepped through the door.



She hurried to greet him, swiftly taking his briefcase before reaching out for his coat.



""Quite a feast tonight,"" he said lightly. ""Did something happen?""



Tall and captivating, Cary carried himself effortlessly. Even the simple act of loosening his tie appeared like a polished gesture from a high-fashion shoot.



Yet, somehow, he always managed to chill Evelina with just a few words. Her fingers paused uncertainly, and she quietly said, ""You didn't forget, did you?""



No, that couldn't be right. He had purchased those priceless sapphire earrings to make amends, hadn't he?



Cary's eyebrows knitted together slightly. ""Forget what exactly, Evelina?""



""The sapphire earrings... you bought them, didn't you?"" Her heart trembled with unease, but hope stubbornly remained.



""How do you know about those earrings?"" Cary appeared genuinely startled. He clearly didn't expect his mild-mannered, invisible wife to keep tabs on such extravagant things.



A faint smirk tugged at his lips, hinting at contempt.



Certainly, Evelina possessed natural beauty--gentle features, eyes soft and expressive--but she refused to flaunt it. She dressed plainly, appearing perpetually dull and overlooked, like a flower that had ceased to bloom.



Even the Gibson household maid seemed more refined than Evelina.



Yet, Evelina gathered her courage, eyes shining cautiously. ""I saw the auction broadcast. Those earrings are really lovely--""



Cary interjected her abruptly, ""They're for Esme.""



At the mere mention of his first love, Esme Barton, Cary's voice softened noticeably. ""She's finally agreed to return to me. Naturally, I needed something special to welcome her back.""



Evelina felt her chest tighten painfully, her breath hitching.



So, the one he felt indebted to was Esme Barton, the very woman who had abandoned him?



And what did that make her--the devoted wife who had stood beside him for three years without complaint, never even asking for recognition?



Unable to bear it, Evelina's voice wavered with hurt. ""Cary, have you forgotten whose fault the accident was--the one that blinded you?""



On that terrible day, Esme had thrown a tantrum over something insignificant, distracting Cary and causing him to crash.



When news broke that Cary's sight was likely permanently lost, Esme swiftly disappeared, crafting a flimsy excuse before fleeing overseas the same day. She left no trace, vanishing completely.



Their wedding had already been announced, invitations sent. Neither Esme nor her family could be located.



If Evelina hadn't courageously stepped in at the final hour, the Gibson family would've been the scandalous gossip of the whole city.



""You know nothing about it!"" Cary retorted harshly. ""Esme wasn't to blame!""



He refused to tolerate any criticism directed at his so-called true love. ""Esme arranged the surgeries for my eyes,"" he replied defensively. ""If someone hadn't accidentally revealed the truth, I would never have known everything she secretly did for me.""



Stunned, Evelina could barely form words. ""What... are you saying?""



It was Evelina herself who performed his surgeries. His grandmother had practically begged her for help. She had conducted three critical procedures, pushing herself to exhaustion. Countless sleepless nights she spent tending to him, never revealing she was the renowned Sight Weaver, devoting herself entirely to Cary.



How had Esme ended up with all the credit?



""Are you certain? You trust every rumor you hear?""



""Absolutely. Esme was Professor Landen Mitchell's last apprentice--the only person on Earth qualified to perform those surgeries,"" Cary responded with unwavering pride and gratitude.



But wasn't Evelina actually Professor Mitchell's final apprentice? How long had Esme been pretending to be her?



Evelina desperately wanted to expose Esme's deception right then and there, but she quickly recalled her mentor's death six months earlier.



Of course, Esme would choose now to make her return.



With Landen gone, no one could challenge Esme's claims. And Cary, fully healed through Evelina's care, now held significant influence as head of the Gibson Group. Esme's timing was impeccably strategic.



Evelina had no evidence, no way to reveal the truth. Quietly, bitterly, she asked, ""Then what are you even doing here tonight? Shouldn't you be celebrating with Esme?""



Removing her apron abruptly, Evelina felt despair gnawing painfully at her heart.



Cary's answer was casual and indifferent. ""I'm exhausted, Evelina. Let's end this marriage. We agreed on three years, and I've endured it long enough.""



Endured it long enough? How dare he casually dismiss all her sacrifices?



Three long years she'd sacrificed, pouring everything she had into nursing him back from blindness, making him the powerful man he had become.



Without even acknowledging the anguish on her face, Cary calmly took out a set of divorce documents, obviously prepared ahead of time. ""Review them. If you have no objections, sign. I've wasted enough time already. I won't make Esme wait anymore.""



Glancing over the papers, Evelina focused bitterly on the divorce settlement--an apartment far from the city center, the worn-out car she'd driven for groceries, and a mere three million dollars.



Incredible. His audacity was astonishing.



He'd gifted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million to the woman responsible for his blindness, yet offered a paltry three million to the wife who had saved him.



Three million wouldn't even cover the cost of one of her surgeries, let alone make up for the countless procedures she had rejected during these three years spent hidden away, caring only for him.



""If you want more..."" Cary anticipated tears or pleading from Evelina.



Instead, she scoffed softly, picked up the pen decisively, and signed her name with determination.



Cary faltered, bewildered. He hadn't expected her to surrender so quickly. Evelina was an orphan--would she really walk away from a life of comfort?



Handing back the signed papers, Evelina said coldly and clearly, ""It's done. But Cary, you'd better not regret your choice.""





Chapter 2 The Queen Returns

Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. ""Of course I won't regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it's your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma.""



Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he'd face her wrath.



And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame.



Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, ""I'm not explaining anything to her. In these past three years, I've settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren't you madly in love with Esme? What's wrong--can't even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother?""



Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi's generosity.



So when the Gibson family urgently needed a substitute bride, she'd readily stepped in.



She didn't flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead, she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him, and managed the household without complaint.



She had one modest request--a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end, they'd peacefully part ways.



Now, finally, her freedom had arrived.



""True love conquers everything,"" Evelina replied dryly, sarcasm lightly coating her words. ""I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever.""



Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary's younger sister.



""Evelina, I heard you're divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property--you can't take it!""



Evelina laughed coldly. ""I paid for this car myself. Honestly, Margot, you're just as brazen as Cary.""



Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward. ""What's happening here?""



Immediately, Margot complained petulantly, saying, ""Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I was planning to use it!""



His brow creased slightly. ""Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot.""



""Absolutely not,"" she replied coldly. ""Why should I?""



""You're unbelievable!"" Margot lunged forward to grab the keys.



Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle, followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.



In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.



""The car is yours--I don't want it,"" Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.



Everything she'd used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.



She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.



As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxury car awaited her.



Kristina's jaw dropped dramatically. ""Well, if it isn't the real Queen Evelina herself!""



Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes. ""Three years, Evelina. Every call I've made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn't tell whether I'd attended your wedding or your funeral back then.""



Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly. ""Finally done with that 'blind' fool? Good. Now we start living for real.""



Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically. ""Wait, no--I need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration.""



""You're too late,"" Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.



Just then, an explosive bang split the peaceful night. The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.



Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.



""How's that for a farewell gift?"" Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.



Kristina erupted into laughter. ""There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!""



Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. ""Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep.""



She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary's recovery, barely managing to rest properly. Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.



Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.



""She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her--""



""That's enough!"" Cary interrupted sharply.



Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, ""Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?""



Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone, saying, ""Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme--she'll see how much you've changed!""



""Don't talk nonsense,"" Cary retorted irritably, though privately dismissing Evelina as insignificant compared to his sister.



He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. ""Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?""



The Russell family, among Ireah's most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.



And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir, wasn't only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.



Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs. Russell.



""I haven't forgotten,"" Margot murmured shyly, blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.



She clung affectionately to Cary's arm, adding eagerly, ""He's visiting for his niece's eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell's eyesight, she'll become indispensable to the Russell family--and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then.""



Cary gave a thoughtful nod.



Esme's supposed medical talent had drawn the Russells to Aglonard, presenting them with a perfect opportunity to solidify powerful alliances.



""And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell's favor... perhaps Jasper himself will notice you,"" he suggested encouragingly.



""Oh, thank you, Cary!"" Margot's eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.



But Cary's thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly.



He had dismissed her as plain, passive, even boring. This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected.



Perhaps... he needed to reassess the woman he'd overlooked for three years.





Chapter 3 The Wife Versus The Homewrecker

Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina's luxurious presidential suite.



Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved, with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.



On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly, requesting Evelina's presence at the Gibson Mansion.



It wasn't difficult to guess the reason behind the call--no doubt it concerned the divorce.



Kristina, however, suspected something deeper.



She said, ""I doubt it's that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury. The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell's elusive protege--the Sight Weaver.



Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I'm concerned she might try to--""



Evelina quickly reassured her. ""Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don't worry.""



Kristina remained cautious. ""Just make sure the Gibson family don't take advantage of your skills again.""



""I'll be careful,"" Evelina replied firmly.



Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, ""You won't be meeting them looking like this.""



Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. ""Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty.""



And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared, replaced by clarity and allure.



With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup, Evelina transformed dramatically.



Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, ""Cary must've been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme.""



Precisely on time, the Gibson family's chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived outside the hotel.



Asher, the family's longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn't recognize Evelina at all.



He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. ""Ms. Marsh?"" He stumbled over his words. ""You look absolutely extraordinary.""



Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.



""Is this Miss Russell herself?"" Margot hurried forward, her expression instantly switching to flattery.



Today marked Jasper's arrival, and Margot had meticulously styled herself since early morning, eager to capture his attention.



She figured it would just be Jasper showing up. The last thing she expected was a stunning woman standing at the door.



With that grace and confidence, who else could she be but a Russell?



""Margot, perhaps you should get your eyes checked."" Evelina's tone was polite, edged with unmistakable disdain.



Margot's mouth dropped open. ""It's you?"" she whispered incredulously, jealousy flaring visibly as she examined Evelina closely.



At that precise moment, another vehicle approached. Cary stepped out gracefully, accompanied by Esme.



Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.



Just a few days had passed--how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless, compelling beauty.



Noticing Cary's astonishment, Esme's jaw tightened, though she maintained her gentle smile. ""That's your ex-wife, isn't it?"" she said softly. ""Since we've run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way.""



Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap--acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.



Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. ""Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary's accounts for your new face and that designer dress?""



Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.



She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, ""Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back? You're delusional!""



In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina's dress and hair.



Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, ""Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today--this isn't appropriate behavior for a Gibson.""



Ignoring Asher's plea, Margot shouted furiously, ""I'll rip that smug face of yours apart!""



Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone, recording Margot's tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, ""Keep going. Let's show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are.""



Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. ""You wouldn't dare!""



Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme, feigning vulnerability. ""Esme, please protect me. We'll be family soon--you have to defend me.""



She emphasized ""family"" deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.



Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot's hair as if comforting a child. ""It's alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I'm here.""



Evelina scoffed sharply, ""Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?""



Esme's expression turned rigid.



This wasn't the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?



Margot quickly retorted, ""Who's the outsider? You're the one who doesn't belong here!"" Turning to Cary, she said, ""Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can't let her bully us like that!""



With practiced grace, Esme sighed softly. ""It's okay. Evelina didn't have parents to teach her manners--it's not her fault. Cary, please don't blame her.""



Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme's implication.



Yet Cary saw none of Evelina's frustration. In his eyes, Esme's gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.



Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina. His voice was cutting, saying, ""If you think causing trouble will win you points, you're mistaken. It's pathetic. Apologize to Esme right now.""





Chapter 4 Demi Takes A Stand

Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, ""Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me.""



Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.



""Don't you dare walk away from me!"" Cary's temper flared, readying himself to berate her once more--but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.



Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist--details he'd somehow overlooked until now.



Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise, and elegance.



Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.



It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn't even touched her once.



Noticing Cary's intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.



Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary's sleeve. ""What are you doing, Cary? You've upset Esme, and now she's leaving!""



Cary blinked, momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.



Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.



Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. ""Evi, my dear girl, you've endured so much.""



""Please don't worry yourself, Demi."" Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again, kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees. ""The weather is getting chilly--are your joints troubling you again?""



Demi sighed deeply. ""Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable.""



""You've treated me like family all these years, Demi. This is the very least I can do in return,"" Evelina replied sincerely.



Her honest kindness only deepened Demi's regret.



""That foolish grandson of mine--blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating,"" Demi replied softly.



Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. ""It's alright, Demi.""



Tenderly, Demi pleaded, ""Evi, sweetheart... just once more, can you give Cary another chance--for my sake?""



""I've waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn't change anything,"" Evelina answered quietly.



She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.



Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone. ""Perhaps it's just fate... our family wasn't fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you.""



Her eyes glistened with tears.



Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary's mother, Elora Gibson.



Demi's temper erupted immediately.



She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme's feet.



Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme's luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.



A sharp cry escaped Esme's lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated, every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques--her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.



Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair, notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.



""What was that about, Grandma?"" Cary exclaimed, swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more, flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.



Demi, however, remained fiercely unapologetic. ""How dare you even ask? Without this woman's antics, would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?""



More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary's bright future.



Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride--Esme hadn't just harmed her grandson, she'd damaged the entire Gibson legacy.



""I've said this countless times,"" Cary responded in exasperation. ""Esme wasn't responsible for that accident. Why can't you trust me?""



His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina, who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.



It had to be Evelina causing trouble again--poisoning Demi's mind.



Without restraint, he said sharply, ""Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?""

In truth, I know I don’t really do much. I help her get changed when she’s too weak, give her medication and formula in her feeding tube 2-3 times a day, check in and sit with her for an hour if I can handle it, and take care of her finances, laundry, scheduling with our hospice team for showers and weekly visits. While I am also pregnant, have two daughters in elementary school, a husband, two dogs and a rabbit. 

As she’s declined it’s become more tiring. Not on a physical level but mental. Her short term memory loops every 2-5 minutes. It’s difficult to try and keep conversation or interest when I know what the next loop is going to be. It’s hard to want to sit with her for an hour or two, when the second I leave she forgets I was ever there and gets upset with me for how lonely she is. No matter what we say, who visits, who calls, it’s never enough.

On top of all this, she is a raging alcoholic. 2 years ago a dear friend of hers passed away and she began drinking heavily, after not drinking at all for nearly 20 years. We cut her down to 2 tablespoons of her favorite whiskey in her coffee, but even with that she was trying to weasel her way into having more and getting agitated when we tried to redirect. 

My grandma raised me. She was/is my mom. Back in February I came to terms that the Grandma I knew, loved, who cared for me and taught me all I know, was gone. There are glimpses of who she used to be once in a while, but she is not the same. 

I’m trying to hold on until respite. Trying to stay positive and not get overly frustrated. She honestly deserves so much love and the best care, she spent her whole life caring and serving others.

Apparently none of them ever had kidney stones before. IF they did, they'd know they hurt like a motherfucker. Just because the actual stone was the size of a mustard seed doesn't mean shit. Your pee hole is like the size of a coffee stirrer at best.

1st episode, he was on waiter duty and the Red team lost. Maryellen and Dewberry were nominated, but GR says that Jeff ""dodged the bullets good.""

All the negative reviews were for shit out of his control by the doughiest snobbiest customers that LA had to offer. (""I have NO patience, Jeff."")

Episode 2 he wasn't much better, was nominated appropriately, but lucked out because Dewberry's crashout (though I will maintain that the fat fuck should have been ejected right then and there instead of getting a ceremonial nomination and elimination)

Episode 3.

People still didn't GAF that he was dealing with kidney stones. They're fucking painful, people!

He reached his breaking point and started to walk off, only to give it another go, called GR an asshole, get snitched on by Sous Chef Maryann, and leave anyway.

After he left, Gordon confronted him in the parking lot and broke his ankles.

For appearing in 3 episodes and cooking in 1.5 of them, he got a nice settlement of $120K, so it's not so bad. Ralph appeared in all 12 episodes and got nothing to show for it.",1,1758819045.0,HellsKitchen,13,0.54,False

I'm a lifelong Chicagoan who has been very fortunate in living in a wonderfully walkable neighborhood, a feeling that I'd like to retain. I'm aware that many other cities are not walkable, but I'm hoping to get some insight from the Houston locals as to something that may even resemble 40% of what I'm used to.

I'll be fully remote, so a commute isn't an issue, and my husband's job will have him traveling all over Texas, so a commute isn't calculable for him. Right now, I can walk 10-15 minutes in any direction and can get to many coffee spots, my gym, a bakery, the grocery store, restaurants, parks, bars, boutiques, galleries, concert venues, etc. I almost never drive here. We each have a car, but really only use it for groceries or visiting family in the burbs.

Again, I'm aware that this level of walkability is a lot to ask for, so I'd be content with just being able to walk to a local coffee spot and a handful of shops. I know I'll have to use my car a lot more. I'm essentially trying to avoid living in a suburb like atmosphere where you literally need to drive to every single essential, and are surrounded by cookie cutter homes and nosy neighbors.

I don't think I have any unhealthy habits that should affect my sleep. I've googled for answers but to no avail. I might go see some kind of professional if I can't get this fixed on my own.

I wouldn't really consider myself stressed and I sleep in a comfortable bedroom. I don't drink coffee or eat large meals before bed. I don't use any medication that should cause problems. I do read books on my phone which might be a factor but it doesn't help not doing it either.

1nqbxfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1nqbxfn/my_routine_evolving/,My Routine (evolving),"Hey, thought I'd share my study routine that's decently helped me fight procrastination. Please feel free to give any feedback. I'm simply trying to contribute to this community as I found it very useful. Paying back and paying forward.

Background: I'm a law student in a dual degree program with a STEM major. My mid-level academic goal is to graduate top 20 in law and STEM. High-level goal is to graduate top 10.

Beginning of the week:

1. Weekly schedule: I use Google Sheets as my main timetable, broken into 1-hour blocks. I loosely map out classes, meetings, and subject-level study (e.g., which subject I’ll focus on).
2. Calendar sync: I then update my iOS Calendar with only fixed events (doctor’s appointments, club meetings, coffee chats, etc.) so I get alarms and don’t miss them.

Beginning of the day:

1. I check my Google Sheet and ios Calendar for what I planned for the day.
2. I update some bigger Daily Agenda in Google Sheet, such as assignments, test prep, admin tasks, etc.

Study blocks:

1. Pomodor: I use ios Notes to plan my daily study blocks to task level. I would have the following list filled out:
   1. ***Session 1***
   2. ***Break 1***
   3. ***Session 2***
   4. ***Break 2***
   5. ***Session 3***
   6. ***Break 3***
   7. ***Session 4***
   8. ***Break 4***

Each session is 25min (pomodoro) and break is 5min. I try to strictly stick to them. If I need longer breaks, I add that into my study plan by minute units (ie. sit for 5min). I would aim to do 4x25' sessions followed by a long break.

2. For breaks, I've started relying on what I call the Break Tool Shed, a list of limited, pre-set activities I can check off during breaks:

1. **Break Tool Shed (Daily)**
   1. Check Reddit (x3)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
   2. Check Yahoo Finance (x3)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
   3. Check EM (x5)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
   4. Check Linkedin (x1)
      * Completed
   5. Check News (x3)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed

The idea is to retrain my brain away from unlimited dopamine hits by capping these activities.

3. Study Set Up: While I study, I have 4 windows open:

i. Google Sheet (for weekly plan)

ii. ios Notes for daily study plan

iii. Focusmate for body doubling (very crucial, as it helps me to treat each session as a professional setting). From this weekend onwards, I'm hoping to pre-book my Focusmate sessions to really lock in my study schedule.

iv. Kairu: I started using this this week. Hoping to get a quick visual on my study analytics.

1nqbx9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1nqbx9u/for_a_year_i_thought_it_was_ppd_but_it_was_a/,"For a year I thought it was PPD, but it was a poorly prescribed medication.","I'm a 43-year-old woman. I've had hormonal issues all my life, which only got worse as I got older. I was diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 15 years ago (and now that I think about it, I still feel like it could have been something else). I had one or two episodes a year. It was bad, but bearable, and I could lead a normal life.



My primary care physician prescribed me oral hormone replacement therapy. Unfortunately, he passed away two years ago. He was a great doctor. Some time later, I started having high cholesterol problems. Since my doctor was dead, I had to find a new doctor. I found an endocrinologist with very good reviews who switched me from oral medication to a transdermal spray, supposedly to improve my cholesterol levels (plot twist, my cholesterol levels never improved on their own). I was relatively well for eight months.

 But then I started feeling bad. First, I had constant, severe episodes of vertigo. and I noticed that it was much harder for me to recover after each episode, then I noticed that it was difficult for me to walk, since I felt dizzy all the time, problems seeing well, I had trouble focusing, the light bothered me, even watching TV and quick movements made me dizzy, I could not sleep well, I spent all day sitting for fear of dizziness, which was intense, fortunately I work at home, but my social life ended, I only went out to go to the doctor, and I saw different specialists, endocrinologists, neurologists, ENT doctors, different tests, they all said that I was fine, that my tests came out well, they even made me feel like I was crazy or lying, blood tests, different medications that made me feel worse, MRIs etc. 

Something inside me told me this wasn't normal and that it wasn't PPD either. When I didn't get a favorable response from the doctors I saw, I started trying to take control of things myself. At first, I thought it was a side effect of some medication, so I started stopping non-essential medications. In the end, the only medications I was taking were my hormone replacement medications (which I didn't suspect was the medication since my numbers were fine). I was on that medication for two months, but things weren't improving, until suddenly, one day I decided to experiment with stopping that medication and going back to my oral medication.



Surprisingly, I felt better from day one, and over the days, I started feeling better. The dizziness gradually decreased until it disappeared, the headaches went away, the vision problems disappeared, and I started to get back to my life, going out again, going to the movies, drinking coffee, moving around, walking little by little, since a year without walking normally had been very hard on me.



There was no doubt, and my suspicions were right. It was a medication, a medication that all the doctors ruled out because they believed it was very safe and my hormone levels were fine.



But it wasn't the medication, it was the administration. Apparently, if I received the medication through the skin, it wasn't consistent, but rather peaked, and the absorption wasn't equal or constant. Sometimes I received too much medication, other times I received too little, so sometimes I had too little estrogen and other times too much, even though my tests came back fine and all the doctors said it wasn't true and that my levels were fine and that it was all in my head.



That taught me lessons, and I should demand them from my doctors in the future. Medicine should be individualized, that what feels good to the majority doesn't necessarily have to be the best for me, and that I should listen to my intuition.



I was fine on my medication, and the doctors, who supposedly wanted me to get better, made me feel sooooo bad for a long time. I feel like I wasted a year of my life suffering.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the starcrawler show at rec room this thursday. that part of chippewa can get a little hectic so it's good to have a plan.  
  
honestly the easiest thing i've found for shows here is using an app called Prked. you can rent someone's driveway or garage right next to rec room. it's usually way cheaper than the lots and you get to totally skip the traffic chaos trying to find a spot. just park and it's a super short walk.  
  
if you want to try your luck with street parking, the official rec room site says there's free street parking on chippewa, franklin and delaware after 5pm on weekdays, which is awesome. just be prepared to circle for a bit cause those spots can fill up fast, especially on a show night.  
  
if you're not into circling, there are a bunch of paid lots. the best insider tip is the lot behind spot coffee on delaware and franklin, which is usually only $5. it's super close. otherwise, you've got a few other options all within a block or two. there are a couple of Pay2Park lots at 267 and 282 franklin st. there's also the main place parking ramp which is a bigger garage if you want something more secure. just a heads up, the venue faq says all the lots around there are pay-to-park no matter what time it is, so don't assume they're free in the evening.  
  
my advice is to get there a little early if you want to snag a free street spot. if you don't want the stress, just book a spot on prked ahead of time or head straight for one of the paid lots.  
  
hope this helps and have an awesome time at the show, starcrawler is gonna be amazing.",1,1758818500.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

**Parsing the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The decimal odds for this Thursday’s encounter between Lyon and Utrecht tell a story of cautious confidence. Lyon, priced at **2.4 on average**, implies a **41.6% chance of victory**, while Utrecht’s **2.95** suggests **33.9%**, and the draw hovers around **30%**. Converting these into a metaphor: Lyon is a well-oiled espresso machine, while Utrecht is a coffee bean trying to decide if it wants to be a latte or a tragic backstory.

The total goals market is tight, with **Under 2.5 goals** favored at **1.87-1.92**, implying bookmakers expect a tactical tussle. Given Lyon’s defense—statistically a vault except when they’re a man down (they’ve only conceded when shorthanded)—and Utrecht’s 15-year Europa League drought, this seems prudent.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Inexperience, and a Dash of Drama**  
Lyon enters this match **without Corentin Tolisso**, their midfield maestro, suspended after a red card against Manchester United. Imagine a five-course meal missing its main course: still edible, but you’ll be staring at the plate wondering where the meat is. They’re also missing Rémy Descamps due to injury, leaving coach Paulo Fonseca with fewer pieces in his tactical jigsaw. Yet, Lyon’s domestic form is stellar—**four wins in five Ligue 1 matches**, tied with PSG and Monaco. Their defense? A fortress… unless you’re a referee handing out red cards.

Utrecht, meanwhile, is a **15-year Europa League virgin** returning to continental action like someone sh

  Lindy Knight stared at the mountain of feathers and cotton batting that used to be her couch and tried not to cry. “Melba?” she called, hoping the desperation she felt wasn’t evident in her voice.  
  
  “Yes, dear?” Melba rounded the corner from the kitchen, sauce-covered wooden spoon still in hand. She stopped in her tracks. “Holy Toledo, it’s snowing in here! Is there a hole in the roof?” She trained her milky blue gaze toward the ceiling.  
  
  Lindy sucked a breath through her nose and let it out slowly through her mouth, like that lady in the yoga video. “That’s not snow. That’s the couch.”  
  
  The old woman shuffled closer and bent low, peering into the mess, dripping globs of marinara onto the crème colored carpet. “Huh. Well, I’ll be. Looks like snow.” She straightened and shrugged. “Thought we had a hole in the roof. That’s good at least.”  
  
  That was good, since a new couch cost less than a new roof. But when one’s life savings amounted to—she spared a glance to the account statement she’d been reading when she’d walked into the house—two hundred sixty-three dollars and eleven cents, neither scenario was exactly ideal.  
  
  “Where are the puppies?”  
  
  “In the kitchen with me. We were making gnocchi.” A delighted grin spread across Melba’s heavily-lined face, and Lindy couldn’t help but return it. There was no question she meant well and wanted to earn her keep. It wasn’t her fault that the attempts invariably backfired.  
  
  “We’ve got to make sure we keep the door shut, okay, Melbs? No puppies in the living room unless I’m home,” Lindy said gently. “I’m going to go through the mail and clean this mess up. I’ll be in to help with dinner as soon as I’m done.”  
  
  “No problemo. We’re finished anyway. I’m on my way out to St. Mike’s, and don’t worry, Fanny’s driving. I’ll put the sauce on warm for you. See you later tonight,” Melba chirped, ambling back to the kitchen.  
  
  Since the last house fire, she wasn’t supposed to be cooking when no one was home, but Lindy needed to pick her battles. At least their neighbor had been kind enough to offer Melba a ride to the church for Friday night bingo. She didn’t have the strength to argue about her elderly charge getting behind the wheel. It had been a doozy of a week, and she wanted it over with. Maybe after dinner she’d curl up with a good book and call it a day.  
  
  She was flipping through the mail, mostly bills, when her cell blared the opening lines of “Push It” by Salt-n-Pepa. Usually, the song cheered her. She was hard-pressed to recall a time that it hadn’t resulted in some serious booty shaking, but today she wanted to pitch the phone into the garbage disposal. She rummaged through her purse and yanked it out just as it went to voice mail.  
  
  One missed call.  
  
  Whoopty-doo. Probably Mal with another one of his cockamamie ideas. She jammed the phone back into her bag without a second look and tackled the onerous task of cleaning up the remains of her couch.  
  
  It took nearly an hour, three vacuum bags, and four trips to the trashcans out front, but by the time she was done, the room looked passably clean. And extremely empty, she noted with a twinge of despair. She cut off that train of thought before it became a real locomotive, and floundered for a silver lining. Now she had an excuse to redecorate, and she did love Indian-inspired designs. It would be the perfect time to find some bright fabric at the thrift store and sew four gorgeous seating pillows to go around the coffee table. She’d get some patterns and ideas online before bed.  
  
  A sharp rap on the door jarred her from her thoughts. She peeked through the peephole and gasped. The man on her porch was the most gorgeous she’d ever laid eyes on. Even distorted by the curved glass, his face was a work of art. Full, firm lips perched above a square jaw, capped off by angular cheekbones and a slash of a nose that kept him from looking too feminine. Close-cropped, raven black hair set off dark gray eyes that were currently locked with her one that was fixed on the peephole, and became filled with exasperation.  
  
  “Hello?” he called.  
  
  “Hello?” she parroted dumbly.  
  
  “Can…I come in, or?” The tone seemed like one reserved for either children or imbeciles and was at odds with the lilting, almost song-like Irish brogue. She bristled despite the delicious accent, pushing thoughts of his stunning good looks to the back burner.  
  
  “I’m not sure. Who are you?” she said, crossing her arms over her chest. She uncrossed them when she realized he couldn’t see her combative gesture. Instead, she narrowed her peeping eye suspiciously, in case he leaned in to look.  
  
  Tall, dark and handsome sighed heavily. “Owen Phipps. We had an appointment.”  
  
  She did a mental rundown of her schedule and winced. They did have an appointment. For a job, no less, and this clearly wasn’t the best foot to start off on. If it hadn’t been for the damned…well, everything today, she would’ve remembered for sure. Compared to all the other wanted ads she’d responded to, this one was the definite oddball and stood out like a gangrenous thumb. She’d found it on Craigslist when she happened upon the “gigs” section entirely by accident. There, at the top of the page, was Mr. Phipps’s strange little advertisement.  
  
  Wanted: Attractive woman, age 25-35, with some acting experience needed for three week position beginning January 25th. Recognizable television and/or movie personalities need not apply. Pay is a flat rate of $20,000 for three continuous weeks of 24/7 availability. Must be willing to travel. Email [owen79@comrex.net](mailto:owen79@comrex.net) to set up an interview.  
  
  She’d actually snorted a laugh when she first saw it, but for some reason she kept coming back to it, re-reading and, more to the point, recalculating. It would take her—she did the math quickly on her fingers—a million shifts at the restaurant to make twenty grand. That amount of money could get her out of the hole and pay her mortgage for a year. With a little old lady and seven puppies counting on her, credit cards bursting at the seams, and everything of value already in hock, she was plum out of brilliant ideas. They had eight weeks before the bank came a-calling. If desperation actually had a smell, she’d reek right now.  
  
  So she’d emailed him. To her shock, he hadn’t responded asking her to send her social security number or a check to secure the position. Nor had he asked her to send a picture of her boobs. No, instead, he’d asked her for a list of qualifications and references, which she supplied. Still, when he contacted her asking if they could meet in his home for an interview, she hesitated. Although there weren’t any obvious indications of psychosis in his email correspondence, odds still had to be pretty good that he was either a whack job or a scammer.  
  
  Right as she had been about to delete his request unanswered, her brother Mal phoned from the vet’s office where he’d gone to pick up Melba. Melba had tried to call Lindy’s cell phone earlier because Sneezy had swallowed the top half of a plastic spork, but Lindy was in the middle of a shift. When no one answered, Melba had taken a cab to the emergency veterinary clinic out in Mount Vernon, since the regular vet was closed.  
  
  By the time Mal brought her home, Melba was armed with the same squirming puppy and a four hundred dollar note advising them to keep an eye out for spork shrapnel coming from Sneezy’s back end. Lindy later found the hunk of plastic on the floor where it had likely been the whole time. She was proud of herself, though. She didn’t have a mental breakdown. Instead, she emailed Mr. Phipps and explained that she understood his desire for privacy, but, as a young woman alone, she would feel more comfortable at her own house, perhaps with her brother in the adjacent room. His response was almost instantaneous. He agreed and commended her vigilance.  
  
  They set an appointment for the following week since he was out of town on business, and she’d gone on with her life.  
She was fairly certain whatever he was trying to pull had been derailed once she’d refused to go to his house, so she hadn’t really given it another thought. His little game had come to its conclusion, and he’d shop for an easier mark.  
  
  But here he was.  
  
  And here she was.  
  
  Alone.  
  
  She steeled herself and laid a hand on the knob. No point in putting it off. If he kidnapped her, at least she wouldn’t have to worry about the mortgage anymore. She ran a hand through her disheveled hair and pasted what she hoped was a capable-looking smile on her face. After a quick breath check, she opened the door, letting in a frigid blast of air.  
  
  “Hello, Mr. Phipps. Do come in.”  
  
  “Please, my da was Mr. Phipps. Call me Owen.” He pronounced it “Ooh-un” and she suppressed a swoon.  
  
  “Owen, then. I apologize for making you wait in the cold. It’s been a hectic day, and I’m afraid I lost track of time.” In her nervousness, she’d adopted some sort of weird, transcontinental accent like the actresses in one of those 1950s caper films she watched on Sunday afternoons. Her cheeks burned at his puzzled look and she slung the door wider to let him in.  
  
  “Where are you from?” he asked, brows raised. He was even taller than he looked through the peephole and seemed to take up an awful lot of space as he pressed by her, into the foyer.  
  
  “Here. I mean, Westchester.”  
  
  He inclined his head but narrowed his eyes. “Your accent sounds like…somewhere else.”  
  
  She forced a laugh. “Sorry, I have an audition for an upcoming community theater production and I try to kind of live in the character.” The falsehood rolled off her tongue before she could stop it, and she cringed. She hated lying, but this guy had her totally off her game. Plus, on the miniscule chance this was a real job opportunity, the last thing she wanted was to be stuck talking like Myrna Loy for the next month.  
  
  “That so? What production?”  
  
  Caught off guard by the question, she wracked her brain for a response.  
  
  “The Vagina Monologues.”  
  
  He pinned her with a blank stare. She didn’t blame him. What was there to say? He was obviously in the company of a blathering idiot. She fought the inane urge to find a mirror and see if her face was literally on fire.  
  
  He cleared his throat before speaking again. “Shall we sit down then, maybe discuss the position and your qualifications?”  
  
  Now it was her turn to stare. What kind of man would still consider hiring a person like her when their limited interaction had been nothing but weird? The thought sent the butterflies in her stomach a-flapping, and she took a few hesitant steps toward the living room. This was it, the pivotal point in every horror movie, the one that always had her shouting, “Don’t let him in, you idiot!” at the screen. And still, she kept walking. Surely a guy that handsome could get a girl to live in his basement cage just by asking, right? No need to go hunting for one. Plus, twenty thousand dollars was a lot of money. She wasn’t backing down until she knew for sure there was no real job. Maybe they could put that on her tombstone. Wouldn’t back down…and paid the ultimate price  
  
  Resisting the urge to genuflect, she blew out a martyr’s sigh. “Please, have a seat,” she said, motioning to the couch that was no longer there. Squeezing her eyes closed, she swallowed a groan. Had she really thought the day couldn’t get worse? How droll. “I forgot. My couch got eaten. Maybe we should go in the kitchen.”  
  
  She scurried by him, surreptitiously grabbing her purse as she passed it. If worse came to worst, maybe she’d have a shot at her cell phone, or at the very least, be able to get a good swing in with the bag. If she did hit him, though, she’d aim for the solar plexus. His face was far too pretty to ruin.  
  
  Where had that come from? He hadn’t even kidnapped her yet and already she was succumbing to Stockholm syndrome. That didn’t bode well for her. If Mr. Owen Phipps was for real, and by some miracle she landed this mysterious job, how was she going to stop herself from falling madly, completely in lust?  
  
  She wasn’t. That’s how.  
  
  …  
  
  Owen watched his odd little hostess, almost in a daze. The ad he’d placed was admittedly a bit cryptic, so he’d been prepared for the freaks to come out. Still, the responses had been so off the charts nutty, he wondered if he’d slipped through a looking glass somewhere. Lindy Knight had been his last hope. After a few reasoned, articulate email exchanges, he’d been cautiously optimistic, but that optimism was fading fast. The Vagina Monologues, indeed.  
  
  Time to determine whether she was a compulsive liar, or if all this madness was the result of a bad case of nerves. The latter he could work with. The former was unacceptable. He couldn’t abide by phonies.  
  
  Lindy swung the kitchen door open and was instantly mobbed by a passel of squirming, ginger-colored puppies. They very nearly took her down, but she managed to grab onto the countertop and regain her balance.  
  
  “Jesus, how many dogs do you have?”  
  
  He knew his tone bordered on incredulous, but his infamous composure seemed to have deserted him.  
  
  “Seven. I’m not keeping them,” she said, bending low to scratch behind ears and pat heads. “I’m…holding them.”  
  
  “Holding them for what?”  
  
  “You know, until I find them homes.” She shrugged.  
  
  “Where are the parents?” he asked, scanning the tiny room for evidence of larger animals.  
  
  She hesitated, pursing her full lips. “That’s complicated.”  
  
  “Are you running some sort of puppy mill here or something?” he asked, oddly disappointed. The woman was probably a wacko anyway, what with the fake accent when he’d arrived and her strange behavior since. So why did it bother him that she was capable of something so unsavory? Maybe it was the cherub face, or the wide blue eyes framed by the pixie haircut that made her look almost fey.  
  
  Those eyes snapped outrage at him now. “No! Of course not. I saved them from a puppy mill. I answered an ad in the paper because I’ve always wanted a golden retriever. When I went there, I couldn’t leave the rest. So I took them all. To hold. I just haven’t had a chance to find them good homes yet. I’ve got the word out with friends, though, so pretty soon they’ll be gone.”  
  
  One of the pups, chubbier than the rest, plopped down on her foot. The annoyance drained from her face, and she grinned. The smile lit her up in a way that gave him the urge to move closer and absorb the warmth. “Come on now, Sleepy. Hop to it.” She gave her leg a shake and the pup plodded off with a yawn. “That’s the one I’m keeping,” she whispered, and pressed her forefinger to her lips.  
  
  “They’re named after Snow White’s dwarves?”  
  
  “Mostly. We’ve got Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful, Grumpy, Happy, and Steve.” At his questioning gaze she shrugged, again dropping her voice low. “We didn’t want to call him Dopey. Might hurt his self-esteem.”  
  
  He nodded, unable to come up with an appropriate response to that.  
  
  She turned to usher the puppies into a large pen that took up the lion’s share of the kitchen. Once they were safely ensconced, she motioned to the table.  
  
  “I can take your coat, and you can have a seat. Would you like something to drink? I’ve got bottled water, coffee, and tea. There’s also some gnocchi on the stove if you’re hungry.”  
  
  Although her words were casual, she clutched her purse close. What did she have in there that she was so protective of? He kept his eyes on the bag and responded. “I’ll leave my coat here. And no, thank you on the food. I’m fine.” Right when he stripped off his coat, the spicy scent of garlic and tomatoes hit him, and his stomach rumbled.  
  
  She flashed that smile again. “You sure? Sounds like your stomach disagrees.”  
  
  Annoyed with himself for being sucked in by a pretty face, and his traitorous stomach for the ill-timed hallelujah chorus, he gave his head a firm shake. “I don’t have a lot of time, so can we…?” He laid his coat over the back of his chair and then set his briefcase on the table, eyeing it pointedly.  
  
&nb  
sp; “Sure thing.” The wariness was back, and she kept a hand on her pocketbook as they sat across from one another.  
  
  As his fingers went to the enclosure on his briefcase, he noticed hers move to grip the sides of her bag. He popped the latch and, with her gaze locked on his hand, she undid the fastener of her purse. She was mimicking his motions. How odd. He paused for a moment then cracked open his briefcase to reach inside. Sure enough, she followed suit, easing her hand into her bag. Fascinated, he moved to pull out the sheaf of papers, but before he could, she let out a yelp and yanked out a pack of Wrigley’s gum.  
  
  They both stared at the gum between them. “Ms. Knight?”  
  
  “C-call me Lindy, please.” She jammed it toward him and the package nearly hit his nose. “Gum?” she squeaked.  
  
  He shook his head, bemused. “No thanks.” Good sense told him he should call it a day and write the last few minutes off as a loss, but considering the pool of candidates he had to work from so far, she wasn’t even close to the worst. The weirdest? Maybe. But she was attractive and did look the part. She’d claimed some acting experience. Maybe she could act a little less weird and they’d do fine.  
  
  Ah well. Another half hour wasn’t going to kill him.  
  
  He pulled the papers from his briefcase and set them on the table between them. Lindy’s wide eyes filled with relief and she slumped forward. Letting out a long breath, she released the stranglehold on her bag. What was she expecting, a hacksaw?  
  
  “Why don’t you tell me a little about yourself? Your resume indicated that you had some acting experience with your last business venture. The…” He glanced down at the sheet in front of him. “Brothers Grim?”  
  
  Her cheeks glowed a pretty shade of pink, and she wriggled in her seat. “Well, uh, it wasn’t really acting, per se. When the real estate market took a dive and I couldn’t sell any houses, I had to look for unique ways of riding out the downturn. I enjoy working for myself, so I set my sights on creating a niche business, something small and different that I could run myself, with maybe a couple part-timers.”  
  
  He nodded encouragingly. Her thought process made a lot of sense. A good sign.  
  
  “I’d walk around making lists of things that would make my own life easier in hopes of stumbling onto the next Google or Post-it notes or something. That’s when I came up with The Brothers Grim. My whole life, I’ve always had a hard time hurting people’s feelings. I once dated a guy for three months because I couldn’t bring myself to break up with him. Nice enough guy and all, but…moist, you know? Like his palms were always cold and damp. Every time he touched me, it reminded me of my creepy Uncle Donny and I’d get all skeeved out. But how do you tell somebody that? So I got to thinking, what if you could hire a company to break bad news for you? Need to fire an employee? Leave your lover? Tell your spouse you were going to jail on fraud charges? The Brothers Grim will do it for you.”  
  
  He eyeballed her hard, trying to determine whether she was serious or not, but she gazed back, solemn-faced.  
  
  “If you hate giving people bad news, then why—”  
  
  “Oh, God no! I didn’t do that part. I handled marketing, booking, etcetera. My brothers, Malcolm and Nathan, were the actual news-bearers. Hence the name of the company.”  
  
  “So why did you stop?”  
  
  She shifted her gaze away and let out a sigh. “Well, that’s kind of a long story. See, on our last job Mal and Nate both came down with a terrible stomach flu. We had a contract with a guy and he said it was an urgent matter that couldn’t be postponed. So, I bit the bullet and agreed to do it myself, this once. I was supposed to tell Mr. Nicholas McElroy’s wife that he was leaving her.”  
  
  Her eyes swam with sudden tears and Owen found himself stuck, unable to look away.  
  
  “I dressed up in a suit, went to the MacElroy house and knocked. Melba MacElroy came to the door. She was…” Lindy paused, dug into her purse, and pulled out a tissue. She let out a long, honking blow before continuing. “She was s-so c-cute. This tiny old lady in a purple housecoat. I wanted to run away, but I had made a commitment and signed a contract, so when she invited me in, I went. I explained that I was there on behalf of Nicholas, and he wanted a divorce.” Her lips curled in a half-smile then. “I thought she was going to cry, but instead she flipped out. ‘That bastard!’ she said. ‘Probably wants to shack up with Roberta Finkelstein. Floozy. Figures he’d go for a young chippy like that. Look at me, married for sixty-two years and I’m a statistic.’”  
  
  Owen realized he was leaning forward in his chair, riveted by this ludicrous tale, and sat back. “What happened next?”  
  
  “Turned out Roberta was the MacElroy’s seventy-year-old neighbor, and Nicholas did plan on making time with her once he got rid of poor Melba. Long story short, Melba decided she wasn’t going to stay in that house a second longer, so she packed up her stuff. She didn’t have any place to go so she came home with me. I closed down the business the next day. Didn’t have the heart for it. It was a bad idea from the start. People should have to face the person they’re hurting.”  
  
  The last part gave him pause and made him slightly uncomfortable. Ms. Knight was making rock-solid sense. By moving forward, he’d hoped to make his sister’s conman ex-boyfriend Nico pay, but wasn’t he, in effect robbing Cara of the chance to face him down herself, if and when she was ready? The thought faded as quickly as it had come. At the rate she was going, his sister was never going to confront the bastard. Owen had counseled her to get a civil attorney and at least get Nico’s face splashed all over the news, win or lose, but she didn’t have the heart. Someone had to make him pay.  
  
  Lindy seemed to be of the same mind as he was. If a person did wrong, they should have to own up to it. She’d said it with such conviction, he wondered if maybe she could work out after all.  
  
  “So what ever happened to old Melba?”  
  
  Lindy gave him a sheepish look. “She should be home in a couple of hours.”  
  
  That stopped him cold. “Wait, she still lives with you?”  
  
  “Uh huh. It’s only been a few months.” She released the death grip on her purse to run a hand through her short, dark hair. “She doesn’t have anywhere else to go right now. Once the divorce is finalized, and the house is sold, she can get a place on her own.”  
  
  Owen pinched the bridge of his nose to ward off the headache that had been skulking around his cranium all morning. So far, he was batting a thousand. After two weeks of interviewing, he’d met nothing but nutters, sleazeballs, and people who were in the country illegally. It was like some twisted version of “The Twelve Days of Christmas”, except his rendition would be more like “Six hookers hooking, fiiiive homeless drunks! Four illegal immigrants, three ex-cons, two exotic dancers, and a bleeding-heart flake with seven puppies.”  
  
  “I do have some acting experience, though. Right now, I’m between businesses, so I got a job waitressing at Medieval Days. I spend my shift pretending the mutton’s delicious. He must be getting used to her quirks because this time her unconventional response didn’t even faze him. He felt a grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. Glancing at her neat little figure in jeans and a wooly cardigan, he tried to picture her at Medieval Days serving food in trenchers, wearing long skirts with a corset. The image sent a surge of blood pumping south, and he bit back a curse. He couldn’t afford to be distracted right now. There was too much at stake to allow biology to sway him from making the right choice, but she also had a guilelessness about her that might turn out to be a great asset. Could Lindy Knight possibly be the right choice for the job?  
  
  He did a mental rundown of the other applicants and grimaced. Who was he kidding? With ten days left, she was his only choice.  
  
  “Miss Knight, I need a wife and I’d like to hire you. How would you like to be my wife for three weeks?”  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  The blood buzzed in Lindy’s ears, and she stared at him, aghast. What did he think, people just went around buying up three-week sex buddies à la Richard Gere in Pretty Woman? She held his gaze and slowly slid her hand to her purse, mentally crossing her fingers that she came up with something more threatening than gum this time.  
  
  “Listen, Mr. Phipps. I’m not sure exactly what that’s supposed to mean, but I know one thing. I’m definitely not the girl for that kind of job. I want you to leave right now, please.”  
  
  His brow wrinkled and he reached into his briefcase. “No, no. That’s not what I—”  
  
  “Don’t take anything else out of your briefcase!” she shouted, her heart thumping wildly in her chest. Now that she’d refused his salacious request, he was going to chloroform her or something. She was sure of it.  
  
  He ignored her and continued rifling through his case. She reached blindly into her bag and yanked out the first thing she could get her hands on. A bottle of body spray. Not ideal, but it would have to do.  
  
  “I’m warning you. Get your stuff and go, right now!” The puppies had risen and were barking like mad, adding to the chaos.  
  
  Owen looked up and frowned. “What are you—”  
  
  He didn’t get to finish his sentence because she sprayed him right in the mouth. She’d aimed for his eyes, but at least it was something. Sputtering, he bolted to the sink. As he turned on the faucet, she rushed at him from behind, pummeling his muscular back with her fists. She couldn’t run away and leave the puppies behind to face his impending psychotic rage, but it seemed like he didn’t even feel her blows.  
  
  “What the hell?” he growled, turning to capture her hands in his, hauling her into his chest. He scowled down at her, dark brows collapsing into an even darker frown and she stared at him in abject terror. Water sluiced down his chin, icy droplets landing on her neck. “Have you lost your fucking mind?”  
  
  His cucumber-melon scented breath washed over her face, and her fear melted under the heat of her fury. “N-no. Have you?” she said, raising her chin defiantly. Might as well brazen it out now. She wasn’t getting away. His body was like a wall of granite, the hold on her wrists like two iron manacles. Not too tight, but entirely unyielding.  
  
  “I’m not the one spraying people in the face with perfume.”  
  
  “Yeah, well I’m not the one coming into a woman’s house, tossing around lewd propositions, and not leaving when asked.”  
  
  His frown deepened for a moment, then faded. “If you’d let me finish, you would have known my proposition was anything but lewd. The contract specifically states that, if you did get the job, we would definitely not be having sex. Now, can I let you go or are you going to keep trying to hit me?” His gaze was wary, but his grip was already loosening. “I only want to talk to you.”  
  
  She hesitated.  
  
  “Lindy, if I wanted to hurt you, I could have done it any time. Even now.”  
  
  “Is that supposed to make me feel better?” she asked. But for some reason, it did. She drew her hands away from his and stepped back, suddenly aware of their proximity in a whole other way.  
  
  “I don’t know what will make you feel better, but I can promise you this. I’m not going to hurt you.”  
  
  His stormy gray eyes were sincere, his expression earnest, and she blew out a sigh. “Okay, okay. Sorry for the whole spraying your mouth thing. I’ve been a little on edge since you got here, and I think my imagination got the best of me.”  
  
  “It’s fine. I should’ve gone about explaining it differently. Can we start again?”  
  
  “Sure,” she said with a nod. He still put her on edge, but it was different now. Not fear, but an awareness that was almost as terrifying.  
  
  Owen rinsed his mouth out a few more times and they settled back into their seats.  
  
  “All right, now for some background information. About six months ago my sister was conned out of her life’s savings by a man named Nico Stephanopoulos. Since she basically handed over the money, no charges were ever filed.” His jaw clenched and he continued. “But her money wasn’t enough. He’s now doing business in Colorado running a married couple’s retreat. I believe it’s a scam, but I need to get proof so he can pay for what he’s done to people.”  
  
  She nodded, the puzzle pieces falling into place. “So you need someone to go there with you and pretend to be your wife.”  
  
  “That’s the plan. As I said, I don’t expect…anything from you in the way of wifely duties. We would, however, need to keep up appearances in public and participate in various retreat activities that require a level of intimacy.” He held up a hand at her suspicious glare. “We don’t have to fawn all over each other, and I promise to be as respectful as possible, but there are sure to be embarrassing moments for both of us. I like to think an all-expense paid trip to Telluride and the twenty grand would take the sting away for you. Needless to say, getting justice for my sister is worth any amount of embarrassment for me.”  
  
  His gray eyes grew steely and she realized that, although he’d seemed unflappable in the face of the world’s strangest interview, he was not a man you wanted to cross. In spite of her distaste for charlatans, she felt a twinge of pity for Nico Stephanopoulos. Then another thought occurred to her. “What does your sister think of this idea?”  
  
  “She doesn’t know. No one knows. That’s why I had to resort to all this cloak and dagger nonsense. Normally, I wouldn’t be interviewing candidates for a job myself, nor would I place an ad in Craigslist. This has to be kept as far away from my usual circles as possible.”  
  
  She thought of her own brothers and how she might react in the same circumstance. “Do you think it’s a good idea to hide this from her, though? She might not appreciate you interfering. Maybe she needs to lick her wounds and put it in the past. Forget it ever happened.”  
  
  “Frankly, I don’t give a rip whether she appreciates it or not. She’s family, and I won’t allow his misdeeds to go unpunished. It’s more than that, though. He started off as a petty card shark, and his crimes have only escalated. If three quarters of a million was his last scheme, what’s next? Now that he’s had a taste of the good life, I’m guessing he’ll go to any lengths to keep it. If I let him walk away scot free, what’s to say the next victim won’t end up with something far worse than a broken heart and a crippled bank account? He needs to be stopped. Tell me you agree with that much, at least?”  
  
  The man was a criminal, and it really would be a shame to see more people hurt by him. Especially if Owen was right, and his behavior was escalating. Still…  
  
  “You could get a really nice couch with twenty grand,” he said.  
  
  Her head was reeling. Between the rush of adrenaline and the subsequent overwhelming relief at not having been serial murdered, she felt shaky and out of sorts. Not a recipe for good decision-making.  
  
  “What’s your time frame?” she asked.  
  
  “We’d need to leave ten days from today. The sessions are three weeks long, but if I get what I need sooner, then we would naturally cut the trip short. Should that happen, you’d still be paid the full, agreed upon amount.”  
  
  “  
Boy, you’re cutting it kind of close, no?”  
  
  “I began the interview process a couple weeks ago. If I don’t find someone this week, I’ll have to cancel and find some other way. You’re my best shot.” His expression was unreadable, but there was a hint of desperation in his voice that seemed out of character for such a confident, aloof man. Like he really needed her. Her heart squeezed.  
  
  Crud.  
  
  When was the last time she’d walked away from someone in need? Here was a man willing to put his life on hold in order to try and make this right for his sister, spend tens of thousands of dollars and saddle himself with a stranger for three weeks. She knew about that kind of love. That’s how she felt about Mal and Nate. There was nothing she wouldn’t do for her brothers.  
  
  “It’s not about the money he took,” Owen said. “I’m fortunate enough to have been able to assist her in that respect. He stole something far more precious. She was a sweet and rare soul. Believed in true love, silly as that notion is, and thought she had it. Always saw the best in people. That’s gone now, and he’s going to pay for taking it from her.”  
  
  The last was spoken with a grim determination. Not a statement, but a vow.  
  
  The words were out before she could stop them.  
  
  “I’m in.”  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  The ten days sped by like a locomotive and Owen Phipps was the conductor. Once they’d signed the contract, he’d taken the reins and before she could even settle down to regret her decision, the day had come. They’d seen each other twice during that time, once to deal with the financial aspect of things and some additional paperwork, and a second time so he could brief her on their backstory and get her measurements for a few items he felt the wife of an affluent businessman should have. On both occasions, she’d gone to bed at night only to be woken by the most intensely erotic dreams, whispered words of passion spoken in a husky Irish accent still ringing in her ears.  
  
  She shook off the memories and paced the hallway, waiting for Owen but unable to sit still a second more. Six of the puppies mimicked her motions while Sleepy nipped playfully at her heels. And what heels they were. She paused to stick out a limb and admire them once again. Nude Jimmy Choo t-strap stilettos. Her stubby little legs looked a mile long in them and she was in love. She loved the whole outfit from the chocolate cashmere jacket to the designer jeans that fit like a dream. A few days earlier, a man in a sleek black car had dropped off two suitcases and four garment bags filled with clothes. He’d handed Melba a sumptuous, ivory-colored envelope before backing out of the door with a bow.  
  
  “Feel this paper, would ya Lindy? It’s softer than a baby’s bottom. I bet it’s from your dreamy Mr. Phipps,” she’d said with a delighted cackle.  
  
  “He’s not my Mr. Phipps. I don’t want you getting ideas in your head. This isn’t a real marriage, Melba. I’m helping him out with a job. That’s all.”  
  
  The older woman waved her off. “You keep saying. Still, it’s so romantic. It’s like he’s James Bond or something and you’re Octopussy.”  
  
  Lindy had winced. “Please don’t share that sentiment with Mal or Nate.” The last thing she needed was is a new nickname.  
  
  Melba had forced her into an impromptu fashion show, which Lindy pretended was a hardship. She’d never owned such gorgeous clothes and couldn’t wait to show them off. They must have cost her new employer a small fortune. She’d wrestled with her conscience on and off since receiving them, but one more glance at his note had reassured her.  
  
  Lindy—  
  
  Don’t give me any hassle. You need to look the part. If it makes you feel better, you can give half of them to the homeless women’s shelter on Market Street when we get back.  
  
  — O.  
  
  It had made her feel better. She’d already made her selections, and the shelter would be her first stop once they got back to town. How he knew her so well after only a few meetings and subsequent phone calls, she couldn’t fathom, but it was a little unsettling. Now that her initial fears had been truly squelched by a list of references and the dossier he’d provided, she had to face her attraction to him head on. No longer diluted by paranoia, it was a pretty heady thing, and she wondered if she’d find him as devastatingly distracting today as she had the other times they’d met. She sure hoped not, or it was going to be a long three weeks.  
  
  A staccato knock interrupted her thoughts and sent the puppies into a frenzy. “Coming,” she called, snatching her coat from the chair as she passed. Her stomach twisted and she laid her hand on the knob. He hadn’t seen her makeover. Would she pass muster in the harsh light of day?  
  
  She swung the door open and froze. Owen crowded the doorway, his broad body filling the space. His dark, freshly cut hair was still damp from the shower. He wore his coat open over an athletic fit camel-colored sports jacket. The ensemble emphasized the breadth of his shoulders and his lean waist.  
  
  He’s your employer and temporary no-sex husband and you are on a job, she reminded herself firmly. “Good to see you again. Come on in,” she said, bending low to shoo the puppies back and make a path for him.  
  
  “Thanks.” He stepped in fast, closing the door before any of them could make a break for it. “Quick little buggers, aren’t they?”

I’m the type of person who plans everything, so most things ended up being in my hands. But it made me sad because even with simple things, he never took the initiative to visit me or pick me up — most of the time, it was always me.

I remember there was a time we had an argument. I told him we needed to talk about it, but he didn’t seem to care. He would always go out with his friends every time we had an argument instead of trying to fix things. And seriously, I was still the one going to him just so we could talk and settle things.

Then one time, it was a day before my qualifying exam, and he argued with me just because I asked him to bring me a charger at a coffee shop near their house. It wouldn’t even have taken him an hour. That really pushed me to my limit. I told myself, “I don’t want this anymore. This can’t be it — when I have a need that’s so simple, he still can’t do it for me, while I always go to him without any excuses.”

Then this July, I asked him if we could go on vacation since neither of us was busy. I even offered to pay for most of the expenses once I received my allowance. And then boom — he said he didn’t want to, giving reasons and excuses. That was really my breaking point. How could he not appreciate my effort before rejecting the idea? At least think about it first. I was so pushed to my limits that I said, “I wish I had a different boyfriend.” I didn’t really mean that — I just wanted him to appreciate me and start taking the initiative. But then I said sorry.

And then… he broke up with me, he said he was pressured and wanted peace.",3,1758818365.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Well, I have a PC, determination, lots of coffee capsules and a big dream... I feel extremely lost, is this common? Well, I literally don't have money, much less enough structure for large teams of developers, or anything like that! My PC is good, powerful in a way, I struggled a lot to build it, so I made it as strong as my budget allowed, I won't have any problems with that... But in other areas, I will definitely have to do it completely independently.

The plot of my game has existed since my childhood, inspired by a nightmare I had when I was 12; I even used the story of this dream for a school project at that time. I was always considered the creative child in the room, modesty aside. So, this won't be a problem along the way, I've been producing stories since I was a child, I just never put them into something bigger like I want to do now. 
But... I kept thinking, how do I do that? Dubbing for the characters is expensive, I'm 18 years old, I live with my family, I don't have a studio and I definitely don't want to use means that go AGAINST the real voice actors. Publicity can also be expensive, as can the soundtrack (probably the most expensive of all). It's great to have the willingness and ideas to produce a game, I don't deny it, but- AAAA! The rest is even more complicated. 

I'm also starting out with Unreal Engine, and I can confess, I'm FREAKING OUT! Where should I start? Which part should I delve into? How to use those countless tools? Being a newbie is a bit of a pain in the ass. 

Sorry for the rant, I hope that as fellow developers, you understand. 🥹🥹

1nqboel,https://www.reddit.com/r/shiftingrealities/comments/1nqboel/what_truly_worked_for_me_after_some_time/,What truly worked for me after some time,"Hello everyone!

I had a huge breakthrough on my shifting journey this week (mostly today, actually) and wanted to share what I learned. I was a bit reluctant to post, as I've had some strange experiences with ""proof"" demands on other subreddits before, so forgive me if I sound a bit reserved and don't want to talk much about my DR itself. The excitement is very real for me, but I saved it for crying when I first came back here haha (I'm from Brazil, so I apologize for any English grammar errors)  


This is also my personal experience and what worked for my brain, so yours can be completely different or resonate with mine, either way... its not a magic solution.

  
For me, the ""intend and go to sleep"" method was never enough. My attempts always followed a frustrating pattern:  


First: I found I could easily enter the hypnagogic state by counting. The problem: I'd get distracted by the random visuals of hypnagogia, forget to shift, and end up in a lucid dream (or astral projecting)  


Second: I refined my technique to enter the void state after hypnagogia. The problem: Same issue! I'd successfully reach the void, but then my mind would go blank or wander off, and I'd forget to focus on my DR.



I finally took a step back and asked the most important question: ""Why was counting for important why does it work, after all?""



I realized it works because it's a form of meditation. It gives your conscious mind a simple task to focus on, which allows it to relax and get out of the way. The magic wasn't in the counting itself, but in the sustained focus on it... Sustained and ONLY focus.



So my solution was... Switching on what I was focusing on.



This changed everything. If the goal was just to focus, why was I using a random anchor like counting?

  
I decided to switch my anchor to something I strongly associate with my Desired Reality: the sound of ocean waves.  


I stopped trying to visualize a whole scene, feel things, or repeat affirmations. I put 100% of my mental energy into one single, simple task: listening to the sound of the waves in my mind. It gave me something related to my DR without overwhelming me about the ""what if I'm visualizing wrong? What if this is too much? What if I accidentaly visualize something stupid or out of the normal on my DR"" thing.  


It worked perfectly. By intensely focusing on that one DR-related sound, I didn't need to ""remember"" to shift. The focus itself guided me there. It was like my consciousness automatically followed the sound to its source. The process became automatic.

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
So finally, my tip for anyone that wants to try this...

Pick one simple thing from your DR that you're good at focusing on, something that would feel natural if it repeated in your mind.  


Think about what comes easiest to you  


If its sound, you could focus on birds chirping, the wind, the hum of a fan, your S/Os breathing, waves on a shore, a wooden ship creaking, or rain on a window. There are countless options.  


If its touch, you could focus on the feeling of the sheets on your DR bed, the warmth of the sun on your skin, or a specific piece of jewelry you wear there. I also would like to recommend the sensation of having your S/O sleeping and cuddling with you, as this was the first thing that made me minishift once!  


Smell and taste, a specific perfume, taste of coffee, tea, juice if its lingering  


I feel like sight could be an incredibly potent one too, of course. You could focus on a single object or the pattern of light on the ceiling, and you might just find yourself looking at it for real without the confusion of ""opening your eyes."" in your DR. But if holding a visual is difficult or stressful for you, don't force it. The goal is to relax your mind. Pick whatever sense feels easiest and most natural to you.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR: I kept getting stuck in hypnagogia/the void and accidentally lucid dreaming/astral projecting. I realized my method (counting) was just a focus tool. I replaced counting with a sensory detail from my DR (the sound of waves), and focusing solely on that made the shift happen automatically.

1nqbnvx,https://i.redd.it/hw0sp0yt9crf1.jpeg,Sour Cherry Coffee Cake,"Made this from Claire's recent YouTube post with cherries from my backyard! I liked that the components could all be made in advance to break up the work. Would not recommend stuffing this all into an 8x8 pan though as the proportion of cake to cherry topping was just too high...stick with the 9x9 she recommends. Could see doing this with many different types of fruit!

Couldn't find the recipe instructions printed online so I typed them up while watching the video. Is that how everyone else follows along too?


Claire Saffitz Sour Cherry Coffee Cake

Ingredients:
FILLING
1 pounds frozen pitted sour cherries, thawed (about 3 cups)
Vanilla extract
⅓ cup granulated sugar
Lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest

1 Tablespoon butter 
2 teaspoons cornstarch


CAKE
1 teaspoon active dry yeast 
½ cup whole milk 
1½ teaspoons vanilla extract 
⅓ cup granulated sugar 
2 large eggs
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
2½ cups all-purpose flour 
1 stick unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons, at room temperature, plus more for the pan


STREUSEL
1¼ cups all-purpose flour
½ cup packed light brown sugar
¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
1 stick unsalted butter (4 oz / 113g), cut into pieces, at room temp


Instructions:

-Macerate the cherries-
Mix frozen cherries with sugar, vanilla, and lemon zest and juice. Set aside to thaw.


-Make coffee cake base-
Butter and sugar in the stand mixer, beat together and add vanilla. And the eggs plus yolk.

Mix dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Alternate adding dry ingredients + milk to butter mixture. Pour batter into a greased 9x9 cake pan. Cover and refrigerate overnight.


-Make the fruit filling-
Strain the cherry juice into a saucepan and reduce by half. In the meantime, allow the cherries to continue draining in the strainer. Stir cherry juice occasionally. 

Mix cornstarch with 2 teaspoons water, then add to cherry juice in the pot. Add butter and melt. Pour thickened cherry juice back into the bowl with the cherries and mix. 


-Make the streusel-
Mix all the dry ingredients and then incorporate the butter until crumbly.

-Bake-
Preheat oven to 350F. Spoon cherry mixture over the cake base. Sprinkle streusel over top. Bake 40 to 50 minutes.

1nqbnlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Carry-8494/comments/1nqbnlh/custom_pouches_the_perfect_blend_of_functionality/,"Custom Pouches: The Perfect Blend of Functionality, Branding, and Sustainability","In the competitive world of consumer products, packaging has grown into more than just a protective layer—it is now a powerful tool for branding, marketing, and building customer loyalty. Among the various packaging formats available today, **custom pouches** have become one of the most popular solutions for businesses across industries. From food and beverages to cosmetics, supplements, and lifestyle products, custom pouches offer a versatile, cost-effective, and visually appealing way to package goods. Their ability to combine durability with aesthetic appeal has made them an indispensable choice for both startups and established brands looking to make a strong impression on shelves and online marketplaces.

One of the key advantages of [**custom pouches**](https://mtpak.com/) is their **versatility in design and structure**. Businesses can choose from a wide range of pouch formats such as stand-up pouches, flat-bottom pouches, spouted pouches, and side-gusseted pouches depending on the type of product being packaged. These options allow companies to tailor packaging to suit everything from coffee and snacks to liquid products and powders. In addition, pouches can be made with features like resealable zippers, tear notches, transparent windows, or spouts for easy pouring, enhancing convenience for consumers. Customization extends beyond structure, as companies can select colors, finishes, and shapes that align with their brand identity. By doing so, custom pouches not only protect the product but also create an engaging customer experience that strengthens brand recall.

Beyond functionality, **branding opportunities** are one of the most significant reasons businesses are turning to custom pouches. Unlike traditional packaging, which often offers limited space or generic appearances, custom pouches provide a large printable surface that can be fully utilized for creative designs. High-quality digital and rotogravure printing techniques allow for vibrant colors, intricate artwork, and high-resolution logos that reflect the brand’s values and story. This is particularly important in today’s digital-first world, where visually appealing packaging can boost social media visibility and encourage consumer engagement. Whether it’s a minimalist design for a premium brand or bold, colorful graphics for a youth-oriented product, custom pouches provide the perfect canvas for businesses to communicate their unique identity.

https://preview.redd.it/u752fr4r9crf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=72112521acffa728936d9152ccda86243f16b87c

Sustainability is another critical factor driving the growth of custom pouches. With increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly packaging, businesses must adapt to remain relevant and responsible. Modern custom pouches can be manufactured from recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable materials that significantly reduce environmental impact compared to traditional plastic packaging. These eco-conscious options ensure that businesses maintain product freshness and durability without contributing to plastic waste. In addition, the lightweight nature of pouches reduces transportation costs and carbon emissions, making them an ideal choice for companies committed to sustainability. By adopting eco-friendly custom pouches, brands not only meet consumer expectations but also demonstrate their dedication to corporate social responsibility, which can strengthen long-term customer loyalty.

Looking forward, **custom pouches represent the future of packaging**. Their combination of flexibility, affordability, branding potential, and sustainability makes them one of the most effective packaging solutions in today’s market. As technology continues to advance, businesses can expect even more innovations in pouch design, such as smart packaging with QR codes, augmented reality features, or built-in freshness indicators that enhance the consumer experience. For companies, investing in custom pouches means more than just choosing a packaging format—it means making a strategic decision to elevate their brand, reduce environmental footprint, and keep pace with evolving consumer demands. In essence, custom pouches offer the perfect blend of practicality and creativity, ensuring that products stand out on shelves while contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.",1,1758818288.0,u_Curious-Carry-8494,0,1.0,False

8. Indians treating Arranged marriage business transaction as a holy and paddhati thing and looking down upon love marriages 

9. People discriminating other castes and dark skinned individuals.

10. Giving bloody dowry. Why do men support this BS. Why do u choose a girl based on dowry dude..I know return lo people will come up with the alimony argument. They will right away not see the number of dowry harassment cases which have such high percentage compared to less than 1% divorce rate in this country. Why don't these men choose a working wife after getting to know them instead of marrying someone who doesn't want to work outside so that alimony ane bokka ne undadu Apudu in case the girl is ""wrong"".

11. Why do people say boys get sandwiched between mom and wife. Don't get sandwiched bro. Learn to call out your parents when they make a mistake or your wife when she makes a mistake. Enduku parents ni impress cheyali ani chustaru?? Enduku wife ni suffer avamantaru. Me father me amma ni support cheyali. In the same way you to your wife. Your son should support his wife and vice versa.

Cooking, chores, life skills, working independently basic for all. Abbailu ammailu idaru nerchkondi.

Ammailu, earn your own bloody money and live ur dreams. Abbailu and ammailu, looks aren't everything. It's the personality of someone that you should be in love with.

  Descent  
  
  Our arrival didn’t exactly go as planned. I remember it was almost dawn when we landed because the streetlights were still on. We had hoped our descent would go unnoticed, which it mainly did, save for a thirteen-year-old boy doing a paper round.  
  
  He was on his bicycle with the newspapers rolled like batons in plastic wrap. It was misty and the boy was wearing a hooded jacket. He seemed to be playing a mental game with himself to estimate where exactly he could get each paper to land. The newspapers hit the driveways and verandas with a thud, and the boy smiled smugly whenever he estimated right. A Jack Russell terrier barking from behind a gate caused him to glance up and alerted him to our arrival.  
  
  He looked up just in time to see a column of white light receding into the clouds, leaving three wraithlike strangers in the middle of the road. Despite our human form, something about us startled him—perhaps it was our skin, which was as luminous as the moon or our loose white traveling garments, which were in tatters from the turbulent descent. Perhaps it was the way we looked at our limbs, as though we had no idea what to do with them, or the water vapor still clinging to our hair. Whatever the reason, the boy lost his balance, swerved his bike, and crashed into the gutter. He scrambled to his feet and stood transfixed for several seconds, caught between alarm and curiosity. In unison we reached out our hands to him in what we hoped was a gesture of reassurance. But we forgot to smile. By the time we remembered how, it was too late. As we contorted our mouths in an attempt to get it right, the boy turned on his heel and fled. Having a physical body was still foreign to us—there were so many different parts that needed to run concurrently, like a complex machine. The muscles in my face and body were stiff, my legs were trembling like a child’s taking his first steps, and my eyes hadn’t yet adjusted to the muted earth light. Having come from a place of dazzling light, shadows were foreign to us.  
  
  Gabriel approached the bicycle with its front wheel still spinning and righted it. He propped it against the closest fence knowing that the boy would return later to collect it.  
  
  I imagined the boy bursting through the front door of his home and relating the story to his stunned parents. His mother would push the hair back from his forehead to check his temperature. His father, bleary-eyed, would comment on the mind’s ability to play tricks on you when it has time to wander.  
  
  We found Byron Street and walked along its uneven sidewalk, scanning for Number 15. Already, our senses were being assaulted from all directions. The colors of the world were so vivid and so varied. We had come from a pure white world to a street that looked like an artist’s palette. Apart from color everything had its own different texture and shape. The wind brushed against my fingertips, and it felt so alive I wondered if I could reach out and catch it. I opened my mouth and tasted the crisp, sharp air. I could smell gasoline and burning toast mingled with pine and the sharp scent of the ocean. The worst part was the noise. The wind seemed to howl, and the sound of the sea beating against the rocks roared through my head like a stampede. I could hear everything that was happening in the street, the sound of a car ignition, a slamming screen door, a child crying, an old porch swing creaking in the wind.  
  
  “You’ll learn how to block it out,” said Gabriel. The sound of his voice startled me. Back home, we communicated without language. Gabriel’s human voice, I discovered, was low and hypnotic.  
  
  “How long will it take?” I winced as the shrill cry of a seagull sounded overhead. I heard my own voice, which was as melodic as a flute.  
  
  “Not long,” Gabriel answered. “It’s easier if you don’t fight it.”  
  
  Byron Street rose and peaked in the middle and there, at its highest point, stood our new home. Ivy was immediately charmed.  
  
  “Oh, look.” She clapped her hands in delight. “It even has a name.” The house had been named after the street and BYRON was displayed in an elegant script on a copper plaque. We would later discover that the adjoining streets were named after other English Romantic poets: Keats Grove, Coleridge Street, Blake Avenue. Byron was to be both our home and our sanctuary while we were earthbound. It was a double-fronted, ivy-clad sandstone house set well back from the street behind a wrought-iron fence and double gates. It had a gracious Georgian façade and a gravel path leading to its flaking front door. The front yard was dominated by a stately elm, wrapped in a tangled mess of ivy. Along the side fence grew a profusion of hydrangeas, their pastel heads quivering in the morning frost. I liked the house—it looked like it had been built to weather any adversity.  
  
  “Bethany, hand me the key,” said Gabriel. Looking after the key to the house was the only job I had been entrusted with. I felt around the deep pockets of my dress.  
  
  “It’s here somewhere,” I assured him.  
  
  “Please tell me you haven’t lost  
it already.”  
  
  “We did fall out of the sky, you know,” I said indignantly. “It’s easy for things to go missing.”  
  
  Ivy laughed suddenly. “You’re wearing it around your neck.”  
  
  I breathed a sigh of relief as I slipped off the chain and handed it to Gabriel. As we stepped into the hallway we saw that no expense had been spared in preparing the house for our arrival. The Divine Agents who’d preceded us had been meticulous in their attention to detail.  
  
  Everything about the house suggested light. The ceilings were lofty, the rooms airy. Off the central hallway were a music room to the left and a living room to the right. Farther along, a study opened onto a paved courtyard. The rear of the house was an extension that had been modernized and was made up of an expansive marble-and-stainless-steel kitchen that spilled into a large den with Persian rugs and plump sofas. Folding doors opened onto an extensive redwood deck. Upstairs were all the bedrooms and the main bathroom with its marble vanities and sunken bath. As we walked through the house, its timber floors creaked as if in welcome. A light shower began, and the rain falling on the slate roof sounded like fingers playing a melody on a piano.  
  
  Those first weeks were spent hibernating and getting our bearings. We took stock, waited patiently as we adjusted to having a physical form, and immersed ourselves in the rituals of daily life. There was so much to learn and it certainly wasn’t easy. At first we would take a step and be surprised to find solid ground beneath us. We knew that everything on earth was made up of matter knitted together in a complex molecular code to form different substances: air, rock, wood, animals. But it was very different experiencing it. Physical barriers surrounded us. We had to navigate our way around these barriers and try to avoid the accompanying feeling of claustrophobia. Every time I picked up an object, I stopped to marvel at its function. Human life was so complicated; there were devices to boil water, wall sockets that channeled electrical currents, and all manner of utensils in the kitchen and bathroom designed to save time and increase comfort. Everything had a different texture, a different smell—it was like a circus for the senses. I could tell that Ivy and Gabriel wanted to block it all out and return to blissful silence, but I relished every moment even if it was overwhelming.  
  
  Some evenings we were visited by a faceless, white-robed mentor, who simply appeared sitting in an armchair in the living room. His identity was never disclosed, though we knew he acted as a messenger between the angels on earth and the powers above. A briefing usually followed during which we were able to discuss the challenges of incarnation and have our questions answered.  
  
  “The landlord has asked for documents regarding our previous residence,” Ivy said, during our first meeting.  
  
  “We apologize for the oversight. Consider it taken care of,” replied the mentor. His whole face was shrouded from view, but when he spoke small clouds of white fog appeared from beneath his hood.  
  
  “How much time is expected to pass before we understand our bodies entirely?” Gabriel wanted to know.  
  
  “That depends,” said the mentor. “It should not take longer than a few weeks, unless you resist the change.”  
  
  “How are the other emissaries coping?” Ivy asked with concern.  
  
  “Some are adjusting to human life, like yourselves, and others have been thrown straight into battle,” replied the mentor. “There are some corners of the earth riddled with Agents of Darkness.”  
  
  “Why does toothpaste give me a headache?” I asked. My brother and sister flashed me stern looks, but the mentor was unfazed.  
  
  “It contains a number of strong chemical ingredients designed to kill bacteria,” he said. “Give yourself a week, the headaches should pass.”  
  
  After the consultations were over Gabriel and Ivy always lingered for a private discussion and I was left hovering outside the door, trying to catch snippets of the converation I couldn’t be part of.  
  
  The first big challenge was taking care of our bodies. They were fragile. They needed nourishment as well as protection from the elements—mine more so than my siblings because I was young; it was my first visit and I hadn’t had time to develop any resistance. Gabriel had been a warrior since the dawn of time, and Ivy was blessed with healing powers. I, on the other hand, was much more vulnerable. The first few times I ventured out on a walk, I returned shivering before realizing I was inadequately clothed. Gabriel and Ivy didn’t feel the cold. But their bodies still needed maintenance. We wondered why we felt faint by midday, then realized our bodies needed regular meals. The preparation of food was a tedious task, and in the end, our brother Gabriel graciously offered to take charge of it. There was an extensive collection of cookbooks in the well-stocked library, and he took to poring over these in the evenings.  
  
  We kept human contact to a minimum. We shopped after hours in the adjoining larger town of Kingston and didn’t answer the door or the phone if it happened to ring. We took long walks at times when humans were occupied behind closed doors. Occasionally we went into the town and sat together at sidewalk cafés to observe passersby, trying to look absorbed in one another’s company to ward off attention. The only person we introduced ourselves to was Father Mel, who was the priest at Saint Mark’s, a small bluestone chapel down by the water.  
  
  “Good heavens,” he said when he saw us. “So you’ve finally come.”  
  
  We liked Father Mel because he didn’t ask any questions or make any demands of us; he simply joined us in prayer. We hoped that in time our subtle influence in the town might result in people reconnecting with their spirituality. We didn’t expect them to be observant and go to church every Sunday, but we wanted to restore their faith and teach them to believe in miracles. Even if they stopped by the church on their way to do the grocery shopping and lit a candle, we would be happy.  
  
  Venus Cove was a sleepy beachside town, the sort of place where nothing ever changed. We enjoyed the quiet and took to walking along the shore, usually at dinnertime when the beach was mostly deserted. One night we walked as far as the pier to look at the boats moored there. They were so brightly painted they looked like they belonged in a postcard. We reached the end of the pier before noticing the lone boy sitting there. He couldn’t have been more than eighteen, but it was possible to see in him the man he would someday become. He was wearing cargo shorts that came to his knees and a loose white T-shirt with the sleeves cut off. His muscular legs hung over the edge of the pier. He was fishing and had a burlap bag full of bait and assorted reels beside him. We stopped dead when we saw him and would have turned away immediately, but he had already seen us.  
  
  “Hi,” he said with an open smile. “Nice night for a walk.” My brother and sister only nodded in response and didn’t move. I decided it was too impolite not to respond and stepped forward.  
  
  “Yes, it is,” I said. I suppose this was the first sign of my weakness—my human curiosity drew me forward. We were supposed to interact with humans but never befriend them or welcome them into our lives. Already, I was disregarding the rules of our mission. I knew I should fall silent, walk away, but instead I gestured toward the boy’s fishing reels. “Have you had any luck?”  
  
  “I come out here to relax,” he said, tipping up the bucket so I could see it was empty. “If I happen to catch anything, I throw it back in.”  
  
  I took another step forward for a closer look. The boy’s light brown hair was the color of walnuts. It flopped over his brow and had a lustrous sheen in the fading light. His pale eyes were almond shaped and a striking turquoise blue in color. But it was his smile that was utterly mesmerizing. So that was how it was done, I thought: effortlessly, instinctively, and so utterly human. As I watched, I felt drawn to him, almost by some magnetic force. Ignoring Ivy’s warning glance, I took another step forward.  
  
  “Want to try?” he offered, sensing my curiosity and holding out the fishing rod.  
  
  While I struggled to think of an appropriate response, Gabriel answered for me.  
  
  “Come away now, Bethany. We have to get home.”  
<  
br />   I noticed how formal Gabriel’s speech pattern was compared with the boy’s. Gabriel’s words sounded rehearsed, as though he were performing a scene from a play. He probably felt like he was. He sounded like a character in one of the old Hollywood movies I’d watched as part of our research.  
  
  “Maybe next time,” the boy said, picking up on Gabriel’s tension. I noticed how his eyes crinkled slightly at the corners when he smiled. Something in his expression made me think he was poking fun at us. I moved away reluctantly.  
  
  “That was so rude,” I said to my brother as soon as we were out of earshot. I surprised myself with those words. Since when did angels worry about coming across as slightly stand-offish? Since when had I mistaken Gabriel’s distant manner for rudeness? He had been created that way, he wasn’t at one with humankind—he didn’t understand their ways. And yet, I was berating him for lacking human traits.  
  
  “We have to be careful, Bethany,” he explained as if speaking to an errant child.  
  
  “Gabriel is right,” Ivy added, ever our brother’s ally. “We’re not ready for human contact yet.”  
  
  “I think I am,” I said.  
  
  I turned back for a final look at the boy. He was still watching us and still smiling.

  Flesh  
  
  When I woke in the morning, sunlight was streaming through the tall windows and spilling across the bare pine boards of my room. In the beams of light, dust motes swirled in a frenzied dance. I could smell the briny sea air; recognize the sounds of gulls squawking and the yeasty waves crashing over the rocks. I could see the familiar objects around the room that had become mine. Whoever had been responsible for decorating my bedroom had done so with some idea of its future occupant. It had a girlish charm with its white furniture, iron canopy bed, and rosebud wallpaper. The white dressing table had a floral stencil on its drawers, and there was a rattan rocking chair in one corner. A dainty desk with turned legs stood against a wall beside the bed.  
  I stretched and felt the crumpled sheets against my skin; their texture still a novelty. Where we came from, there were no textures, no objects. We needed nothing physical to sustain us and so there was nothing. Heaven was not easy to describe. Some humans might catch a glimpse of it on occasion, buried somewhere in the recesses of their unconscious, and wonder briefly what it all meant. Try to imagine an expanse of white, an invisible city, with nothing material to be seen but still the most beautiful sight you could imagine. A sky like liquid gold and rose quartz, a feeling of buoyancy, of weightlessness, seemingly empty but more majestic than the grandest palace on earth. That was the best I could do when trying to describe something as ineffable as my former home. I was not too impressed with human language; it seemed absurdly limited. There was so much that couldn’t be put into words. That was one of the saddest things about people—their most important thoughts and feelings often went unspoken and barely understood.  
  
  One of the most frustrating words in the human language, as far as I could tell, was love. So much meaning attached to this one little word. People bandied it about freely, using it to describe their attachments to possessions, pets, vacation destinations, and favorite foods. In the same breath they then applied this word to the person they considered most important in their lives. Wasn’t that insulting? Shouldn’t there be some other term to describe deeper emotion? Humans were so preoccupied with love. They were all desperate to form an attachment to one person they could refer to as their “other half.” It seemed from my reading of literature that being in love meant becoming the beloved’s entire world. The rest of the universe paled into insignificance compared to the lovers. When they were separated, each fell into a melancholy state, and only when they were reunited did their hearts start beating again. Only when they were together could they really see the colors of the world. When they were apart, that color leached away, leaving everything a hazy gray. I lay in bed, wondering about the intensity of this emotion that was so irrational and so irrefutably human. What if a person’s face was so sacred to you it was permanently inscribed in your memory? What if their smell and touch were dearer to you than life itself? Of course, I knew nothing about human love, but the idea had always been intriguing to me. Celestial beings never pretended to understand the intensity of human relationships; but I found it amazing how humans could allow another person to take over their hearts and minds. It was ironic how love could awaken them to the wonders of the universe, while at the same time confine their attention to one another.  
  
  The sounds of my brother and sister moving around in the kitchen downstairs broke into my reverie and drew me out of bed. What did my ruminations matter anyway when human love was barred to angels?  
  
  I wrapped a cashmere throw around me to keep warm and padded barefoot down the stairs. In the kitchen I was met by the inviting smell of toast and coffee. I was pleased to find myself adjusting to human life—a few weeks ago such smells might have brought on a headache or a wave of nausea. But now I was starting to enjoy the experience. I curled my toes, enjoying the feel of the smooth timber boards underfoot. I didn’t even care when, still only half awake, I clumsily stubbed my toe on the refrigerator. The shooting pain only served to remind me that I was real and that I could feel.  
  
  “Good afternoon, Bethany,” said my brother jokingly as he handed me a steaming mug of tea. I held it a fraction too long before putting it down, and it scalded my fingers. Gabriel noticed me flinch, and I saw a frown crinkle his forehead. I was reminded that unlike my two siblings I was not immune to pain.  
  
  My physical form had the same vulnerabilities as a human body did, although I was able to self-heal minor injuries like cuts and broken bones. It had been one of Gabriel’s concerns about my being chosen for this in the first place. I knew he saw me as vulnerable and thought the whole mission might prove too dangerous for me. I had been chosen because I was more in tune with the human condition than other angels—I watched over humans, empathized with them, and tried to understand them. I had faith in them and cried tears for them. Perhaps it was because I was young—I had been created only seventeen mortal years ago, which equated to infancy in celestial years. Gabriel and Ivy had been around for centuries; they had fought battles and witnessed human atrocities beyond my imagination. They’d had all of time to acquire strength and power to protect them on earth. They’d both visited earth on a number of missions so they’d had time to adjust to it and were aware of its perils and pitfalls. But I was an angel in the purest, most vulnerable form. I was naïve and trusting, young and fragile. I could feel pain because years of wisdom and experience did not protect me from it. It was for this reason that Gabriel wished I had not been chosen, and it was for this reason that I had.  
  
  But the final decision hadn’t been up to him; it was up to someone else, someone so supreme even Gabriel didn’t dare argue. He had to resign himself to the fact that there must be a divine reason behind my selection, which was beyond even his understanding.  
  
  I sipped tentatively at my tea and smiled at my brother. His expression cleared, and he picked up a box of cereal and scrutinized its label.  
  
  “What’ll it be—toast or something called Honey Wheat Flakes?”  
  
  “Not the flakes,” I said, wrinkling my nose at the cereal.  
  
  Ivy was seated at the table idly buttering a piece of toast. My sister was still trying to develop a taste for food, and I watched her cut her toast into neat little squares, shuffle the pieces around her plate and put them back together like a jigsaw puzzle. I went to sit next to her, inhaling the heady scent of freesia that always seemed to pervade the air around her.  
  
  “You look a little pale,” she observed with her usual calm, lifting away a strand of white-blond hair that had fallen over her rain gray eyes. Ivy had become the self-appointed mother hen of our little family.  
  
  “It’s nothing,” I replied casually and hesitated before adding, “just a bad dream.” I saw them both stiffen slightly and exchange concerned glances.  
  
  “I wouldn’t call that nothing,” Ivy said. “You know we aren’t meant to dream.” Gabriel returned from his position by the window to study my face more closely. He lifted my chin with the tip of his finger. I noticed his frown had returned, shadowing the grave beauty of his face.  
  
  “Be careful, Bethany,” he counseled in his now-familiar older brother tone. “Try not to become attached to physical experiences. Exciting as it may seem, remember we are only visitors here. All of this is temporary and sooner or later we will have to return. . . .” Seeing my forlorn look made him stop short. When he continued, it was in a lighter voice. “Well, there’s plenty of time before that happens so we can discuss it later.”  
  
  It was strange visiting earth with Ivy and Gabriel. They attracted so much attention wherever we went. In his physical form, Gabriel might well have been a classical sculpture come to life. His body was perfectly proportioned and each muscle looked as if it had been sculpted out of the purest marble. His shoulder-length hair was the color of sand and he often wore it pulled back in a loose ponytail. His brow was strong and his nose arrow straight. Today he was wearing faded blue jeans worn through at the knees and a crumpled linen shirt, both of which gave him a disheveled beauty. Gabriel was an archangel and a member of the Holy Seven. Although his clique ranked only second in the divine hierarchy, they were exclusive and had the most interaction with human beings. In fact, they were created to liaise between the Lord and mortals. But at heart Gabriel was a warrior—his celestial name meant “Hero of God”—and it was he who had watched Sodom and Gomorrah burn.  
  
  Ivy, on the other hand, was one of the wisest and oldest of our kind, although she didn’t look a day over twenty. She was a seraphim, the order of angels closest to the Lord. In the Kingdom, seraphim had six wings to mark the six days of creation. A gold snake was tattooed on Ivy’s wrist as a mark of her rank. It was said that in battle the seraphim would come forward to spit fire on the earth, but she was one of the gentlest creatures I’d ever met.  
In her physical form, Ivy looked like a Renaissance Madonna with her swanlike neck and pale oval face. Like Gabriel, she had piercing rain gray eyes. This morning she wore a white flowing dress and gold sandals.  
  
  I, on the other hand, was nothing special, just a plain, old transition angel—bottom of the rung. I didn’t mind; it meant I was able to interact with the human spirits that entered the Kingdom. In my physical form, I looked ethereal like my family, except my eyes were as brown as river stones and my chestnut brown hair fell in loose waves down my back. I’d thought that once I was recruited for an earth posting I’d be able to choose my own physical form, but it didn’t work that way. I was created small, fine boned, and not especially tall, with a heart-shaped face, pixielike ears, and skin that was milky pale. Whenever I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror, I saw an eagerness that was missing from the faces of my siblings. Even when I tried, I could never look as removed as Gabe and Ivy. Their expressions of grave composure rarely altered, regardless of the drama unfolding around them. My face always wore a look of restless curiosity no matter how hard I tried to look worldly.  
  
  Ivy crossed to the sink holding her plate, as always moving as though she were dancing rather than walking. Both my brother and sister moved with an unstudied grace that I was incapable of imitating. More than once I’d been accused of stomping through the house as well as being heavy-handed.  
  
  When she’d disposed of her half-eaten toast, Ivy stretched out on the window seat, the newspaper open in front of her.  
  
  “What’s news?” I asked.  
  
  In reply she held up the front page for me to see. I read the headlines—bombings, natural disasters, and economic collapse. I felt immediately defeated.  
  
  “Is it any wonder that people don’t feel safe,” Ivy said with a sigh. “They have no faith in one another.”  
  
  “If that’s true then what can we possibly do for them?” I asked hesitantly.  
  
  “Let’s not expect too much too soon,” said Gabriel. “They say change takes time.”  
  
  “Besides, it’s not for us to try and save the world,” Ivy said. “We must focus on our little portion of it.”  
  
  “You mean this town?”  
  
  “Of course.” My sister nodded. “This town was listed as a target of the Dark Forces. It’s strange the places they choose.”  
  
  “I imagine they’re starting small and working their way up,” said Gabriel in disgust. “If they can conquer a town, they can conquer a city, then a state, then a country.”  
  
  “How do we know how much damage they’ve already done?” I asked.  
  
  “That will become clear in time,” said Gabriel. “But so help us, we will put an end to their destructive work. We won’t fail in our mission, and before we depart, this place will once again be in the hands of the Lord.”  
  
  “In the meantime, let’s just try and blend in,” Ivy said, perhaps in an effort to lighten the mood. I almost laughed aloud and was tempted to suggest she look in a mirror. She might be as old as time, but sometimes Ivy could sound quite naïve. Even I knew that blending in was going to be a challenge.  
  
  Anyone could see that we were different—and not in an art student’s dyed-hair-and-kooky-stockings kind of way. We were really different—out-of-this-world different. I guess that wasn’t unusual given who we were . . . or rather, what we were. There were several things that made us conspicuous. For starters, human beings were flawed and we weren’t. If you saw one of us in a crowd, the first thing you’d notice was our skin. It was so translucent you might be persuaded into believing that it contained actual particles of light. This became even more evident after dark when any exposed skin emitted a faint glow as if from some inner energy source. Also, we never left footprints, even when we were walking on something impressionable like grass or sand. And you’d never catch any one of us in a tank top—we always wore high-backed tops to cover up a minor cosmetic problem.  
  
  As we began to assimilate into the life of the town, the locals couldn’t help but wonder what we were doing in a sleepy backwater like Venus Cove. Sometimes they thought we were tourists on an extended stay; other times we’d be mistaken for celebrities, and they’d ask us about TV shows we’d never even heard of. No one guessed that we were working; that we had been recruited to assist a world on the brink of destruction. You only had to open a newspaper or flick on a television to see why we’d been sent: murder, kidnapping, terrorist attacks, war, assaults on the elderly . . . the ugly list went on and on. There were so many souls in peril that the Agents of Darkness were seizing the opportunity to gather. Gabriel, Ivy, and I had been sent here to offset their influence. Other Agents of Light had been sent to various locations across the globe, and eventually we would be summoned to evaluate our findings. I knew the situation was dire, but I was certain that we couldn’t fail. In fact, I thought it would be easy—our presence would be the divine solution. I was about find out just how wrong I was.  
  
  We were fortunate to have ended up at Venus Cove. It was a breathtaking place of striking contrasts. Parts of the coastline were windswept and rugged, and from our house we could see the looming cliffs overlooking the dark, rolling ocean and hear the wind howling through the trees. But a little farther inland, there were pastoral scenes of undulating hills with grazing cows and pretty windmills.  
  
  Most of the houses in Venus Cove were modest weatherboard cottages but, closer to the coast, was a series of tree-lined streets with larger, more impressive homes. Our house, Byron, was one of these. Gabriel wasn’t overly thrilled with our accommodations—the cleric in him found it excessive, and he would no doubt have felt more at ease in something less luxurious, but Ivy and I loved it. And if the powers that be didn’t see any harm in us enjoying our time on earth, why shouldn’t we? I suspected the house might not help achieve our goal of blending in, but I kept quiet. I didn’t want to complain when I already felt too much like a liability on this mission.  
  
  Venus Cove had a population of around three thousand, although this doubled during the summer break when the town transformed into a teeming resort. Regardless of the time of year, the locals were open and friendly. I liked the atmosphere of the place: There were no people in business suits charging off to high-powered jobs; no one was in a hurry. The people didn’t seem to care if they had dinner at the swankiest restaurant in town or at the beachside snack bar. They were just too laid back to worry about things like that.  
  
  “Do you agree, Bethany?” The rich timbre of Gabriel’s voice recalled me to the present. I tried to remember the threads of the conversation but drew a complete blank.  
  
  “Sorry,” I said, “I was miles away. What were you saying?”  
  
  “I was just setting out some ground rules. Everything will be different as of today.”  
  
  Gabriel was frowning again, mildly annoyed by my inattention. The two of us were starting at the Bryce Hamilton School that morning, me as a student and Gabriel as the new music teacher. It had been decided that a school would be a useful place to begin our work of countering the emissaries of darkness, given it was full of young people whose values were still evolving. Ivy was too unearthly to be herded off to high school, so it was agreed that she would mentor us and ensure our safety, or rather, my safety, as Gabriel could look after himself.  
  
  “The important thing is not to lose sight of why we’re here,” Ivy said. “Our mission is clear: to perform good deeds, acts of charity and kindness; to lead by example. We don’t want any miracles just yet, not until we can predict how they would be received. At the same time we want to observe and learn as much as we can about people. Human culture is so complex and different from anything else in the universe.”  
  
  I suspected these ground rules were mostly for my benefit. Gabriel never had difficulty handling himself in any kind of situation.  
  
  “This is going to be fun,” I said, perhaps a little too enthusiastically.  
  
  “It’s not about fun,” retorted Gabriel. “Haven’t you heard anything we’ve said?”  
  
  “Essentially we are tryi  
ng to drive away the evil influences and restore people’s faith in each other,” said Ivy in a conciliatory tone. “Don’t worry about Bethany, Gabe—she’ll be fine.”  
  
  “In short, we are here to bless the community,” my brother continued. “But we mustn’t appear too conspicuous. Our first priority is to remain undetected. Bethany, please try not to say anything that will . . . unsettle the students.”  
  
  It was my turn to be offended.  
  
  “Like what?” I demanded. “I’m not that scary.”  
  
  “You know what Gabriel means,” said Ivy. “All he’s suggesting is that you think before you speak. No personal talk about home, no ‘God reckons’ . . . or ‘God told me’ . . . they might think you’re on something.”  
  
  “Fine,” I said huffily. “But I hope I’m at least allowed to fly around the corridors during lunch hour.”  
  
  Gabriel threw me a disapproving look. I waited for him to get my joke, but his eyes remained serious. I sighed. Much as I loved him, Gabriel could be totally lacking in any sense of humor.  
  
  “Don’t worry, I’ll behave. I promise.”  
  
  “Self-control is of the utmost importance,” Ivy said.  
  
  I sighed again. I knew I was the only one who had to worry about self-control. Ivy and Gabriel had enough experience of this kind for it to be second nature—they knew the rules back to front. It wasn’t fair. They also had steadier personalities than I did. They might as well have been called the Ice King and Queen. Nothing fazed them, nothing troubled them, and most important, nothing upset them. They were like well-rehearsed actors whose lines came to them without effort. It was different for me; I’d struggled from the outset. For some reason, becoming human had really thrown me. I wasn’t prepared for the intensity of it. It was like going from blissful emptiness to experiencing a roller coaster of sensations all at once. Sometimes the sensations crossed over and shifted like sand so the end result was total confusion. I knew I was supposed to detach myself from all things emotional, but I hadn’t worked out how. I marveled at how ordinary humans managed to live with such turmoil bubbling below the surface all the time—it was draining. I tried to hide my difficulties from Gabriel; I didn’t want to prove him right or have him thinking less of me because of my struggles. If my siblings ever experienced anything similar, they were expert at suppressing it.

During a trip to Southeast Asia, my tour guide told me a story that I'll never be able to forget. Its horrifying and chilling nature haunted me for a long time. Today, I'm going to retell that story for those of you who love the horror genre. I will recount it from the main character's perspective.

\----------------------------------------------

**Gate of Souls. Chapter 1.**

""I left my peaceful village to go to the city with the hope of changing my life. Or at least to find a job that could support myself and help my parents take care of my two siblings who are still in school. But that hope gradually faded, as it has been nearly a month since I came to the city. As a country boy with no degree or any connections or relatives here, of course, I couldn't get a decent job.

Until today, while sitting absentmindedly at a roadside cafe thinking about my murky future, a man approached me from out of nowhere. He looked at the portfolio in my hand and asked softly:

'Are you... looking for a job, young man?'

'Yes...' I answered listlessly with a face full of despair.

He looked at me for a few seconds and then asked:

'The security guard at my place just quit. Do you want to be a security guard?'

Like a drowning person grabbing a lifebuoy, I said excitedly:

'Yes... I do! Is your place nearby?'

'Just across the street! Want to go now?'

I nodded and hastily asked for the bill, then followed him into the small alley opposite. The alley was very narrow, just enough for a motorbike to pass through, and it was very deserted. I felt a pang of unease and urged:

'Are we there yet, sir?'

He stopped and said simply:

'We're here!'

'Here?' I was surprised.

In front of me was an old iron gate, with a surveillance camera mounted above. Behind the gate was a staircase with worn-out tiled steps. I took a few steps back and looked up. Under the scorching midday sun, many regularly spaced windows appeared before my eyes.

'This looks like an apartment building... and it seems to have been built a long time ago!' I thought to myself and asked the man:

'Are you the owner here, sir?'

'No, I'm just the manager!' he shook his head.

Seeing my hesitation, he asked:

'What do you think, young man?'

Honestly, I was a bit hesitant at that moment. The feeling here was very strange and unexplainable. But then I thought about the money in my pocket, which was almost gone. If I couldn't find a job today, I would surely have to pack up and go back home. 'I can't. What will I say to my family if I go back now? My parents borrowed money for me to come here to start a new life. How can I give up so easily!' I made up my mind, nodded, and said:

'When can I start working, sir?'

He said in a calm voice:

'Come here at 11 p.m. tonight, and I'll hand over the job!'

I nodded, thanked him, and left, my heart filled with joy that I had finally found a job to continue living in this bustling but also glamorous city. But I didn't know that it was just the beginning of a series of bizarre days that I would probably never forget for the rest of my life...

...

I stepped out of the house, looking as neat and presentable as possible for my first day of work. My heart was both happy and nervous, and I walked quickly on the street that was gradually becoming less crowded, with shops on both sides having almost closed down. Luckily, the alley where I worked was not far from my rented room, only about a 10-minute walk. Looking at my watch, it was only 10:30 p.m., so I stopped by a water stall that hadn't closed yet to buy a cup of coffee and then crossed the street to enter the same alley from the morning.

This alley was deserted during the day, but at night, it looked much scarier. It was very dark, with almost no streetlights except for a little light spilling from the nearby houses. I felt a little uneasy. Dark places like this are often where robberies happen, or at least where junkies and addicts hang out, asking for money. Thinking about having to walk through here every day, I suddenly felt discouraged.

'Did I... just see someone?'

At the corner of the alley, a young man was sitting silently in a dark corner, staring at me with cloudy, unblinking eyes. 'Oh, damn, why am I so unlucky!' I muttered to myself, sweating profusely at the sight of him. He was wearing a grayish-brown shirt and torn denim shorts, his body was skinny, and his face was gaunt as if he had been starved for a long time.

I walked away quickly. I kept glancing back behind me. Fortunately, he didn't follow. But I seemed to feel his eyes still watching my every move.

Sighing with relief, I finally arrived at my workplace. The iron gate was still closed, and the manager from the morning was nowhere to be seen.

'Sir... excuse me, I'm here to start work!'

I was flustered as I suddenly remembered that I didn't even know his name. How could I have been so careless! I waited for a moment, then called out again, but still, no one opened the door. It was almost 11 p.m., and my mind started to have thoughts like... maybe I was scammed? Who would hire an employee just by talking like this? And why would he scam a nobody like me, with only a few dollars in my pocket?

While I was feeling confused, a child's voice suddenly rang out right behind me:

'Who are you looking for, sir?'

I turned around, and it was a boy about 7 or 8 years old with big, black eyes. His whole body was covered in sweat and dirt, and he was holding a red leather ball. I asked him:

'I'm waiting for the manager here. Have you seen him, kid?'

The boy shook his head, then continued to run and play around in front.

'Why aren't you home sleeping at this hour? Where do you live?' I asked.

The boy stopped, panting, and replied:

'I'm waiting for my dad to come home. I live here!'

He pointed his hand at the iron gate behind me. So he was also a resident of this apartment building. Exactly at 11 p.m., the iron gate suddenly opened. Hearing its heavy creaking sound, I suddenly felt a shiver.

'Sorry to have kept you waiting, young man!'

Oh my god, so he was inside all this time. Why didn't he answer me earlier? Or maybe he didn't hear me calling? I forced a smile, even though I was a little annoyed:

'Yes... no problem, sir!'

'Come in!'

He gestured for me to go into the room right next to the stairs. I instinctively turned around to look at the boy, but he was no longer there. I thought his dad must have come to pick him up, so I didn't pay any more attention to it...

The manager introduced himself as Tan. The job was surprisingly simple. I just had to sit in one place and watch the cameras to monitor people coming and going. At 3 a.m., I had to take a walk around the building to check things, and then return to the camera room until the end of my shift. He then gave me two uniforms, a flashlight, a large bunch of building keys, a walkie-talkie, and said that the walkie-talkie was only for contacting him in an emergency, and it had no other function because I was the only security guard in the whole apartment complex.

After giving me the instructions, Tan asked:

'Do you have any other questions?'

'I just want to ask how many floors this apartment building has?'

'Only three floors. How does that sound?' Tan smiled.

'Piece of cake, sir!' I replied with a smile.

Tan said goodbye and left. He walked, so his house must be nearby. Left alone, I started to get used to the job by looking at each camera screen and memorizing its location. Fortunately, each screen had the floor number displayed on it and was arranged very logically, so it didn't take me long.

It's true that every job has its own difficulties. And the first difficulty of this job was... how to not fall asleep. Indeed, several hours had passed, but I didn't know what to do other than stare at the empty screens. Sooner or later, sleepiness began to creep in. Looking at my watch, it was almost 1 a.m. At this hour, there were probably no more people coming or going. I checked the door, then set an alarm for 3 a.m. just in case I fell asleep.

My eyelids were getting heavy, and the cup of coffee I bought earlier was all gone. I wearily rested my head on the table. The air conditioner continuously blew a cool breeze in the hot summer weather, making my body feel even more relaxed, and I fell asleep without even knowing it...

...

The echoing, creepy laughter of a child woke me up like a spring. For a second, my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest before I fumbled for my phone and turned it off.

'Oh my god, I forgot to change the ringtone...'

I mumbled to myself, then lazily got up and stretched my limbs. It was time to go check the building. A quick glance at the camera screens showed that everything seemed fine. I tucked the walkie-talkie into my belt and stepped out of the surveillance room.

My footsteps echoed throughout the apartment corridor. The hallway lights were almost all off. The clearest light came from the flashlight in my hand. Each floor had about 10 apartments, and the stairs were right next to the wall. This meant that after checking one floor, I had to go back to take the stairs to the next floor. It seemed a bit inconvenient, but I didn't mind much, I just considered it as checking twice in one trip.

The first and second floors were nothing strange, all the doors were closed. When I got to the third floor, it was a little different from the two floors below, this floor had 11 rooms. At the end of the hall, there was an iron sliding door, and behind it were stairs leading up, probably to the rooftop.

'Do I need to check the rooftop?'

I tried to use the keys, but none of them seemed to open the door. While I was fumbling, a whirring sound suddenly rang out right next to my ear. I was startled and turned to see an elevator going up right next to the iron door. Maybe it was too dark on this floor, so I didn't see it.

'Why didn't Tan tell me there was an elevator here?'

The elevator stopped right on the third floor. I don't know why I felt so nervous and anxious. Only a few seconds passed, but it felt so long, like I was watching a slow-motion movie. The door slowly opened...

There was no one inside. The elevator was pitch black, with only a strange greenish light coming from a small neon light attached above.

'Who would install a light of this color? Are they trying to scare people?' I grimaced.

In the right corner, there was a small camera mounted next to the light bulb. I tried to rack my brain, but I couldn't remember if any screen in the surveillance room was connected to this camera.

A cold gust of wind suddenly blew past me, giving me goosebumps. The elevator door slowly closed, and then it stopped completely. Everything became quiet again as if nothing had happened.

I hurriedly picked up the walkie-talkie to call Tan, but then I remembered that he was probably asleep at this hour. Not wanting to disturb his sleep, I decided to wait until tomorrow to ask him.

Walking down the stairs, the surveillance room was only a few steps away when from behind, a red leather ball rolled down, making heavy thudding sounds. It was the ball of the little boy from earlier. Was he still awake at this hour?

I looked up but only saw the deep blackness of the darkness. Picking up the ball, I thought for a moment, then took it into the room and put it in a corner, planning to find the boy in the morning to return it...

...

It was 3:30 a.m., which meant I had spent about half an hour on this patrol. It was quite fast, I guess. I plopped down on the chair, leaned back, my eyes dull and bloodshot from sleepiness. I suddenly remembered the camera in the elevator, so I checked all the screens in front of me again. There really was no screen connected to that camera. Maybe... it was broken?

Bored with thinking, I just gave up on everything because my eyes were getting stuck together. I set the alarm for 5 a.m., rested my head on the table, and planned to get a little more sleep to clear my head. But after only about 5 minutes of dozing off, I was startled awake by the cold. I fumbled around to find the remote to turn off the air conditioner, with my eyes barely open.

'That's strange, I can't find the remote?'

I searched every corner of the room but still couldn't find it. I wearily looked up at the air conditioner to see if there was a switch or something to turn it off. But... I discovered something incredibly terrifying about this room that I hadn't realized until now. This room... didn't have an air conditioner.""

My husband and I are headed to NOLA mid December for 4 nights. We’ll have our 16month old in tow. I’ve been many times pre- spouse and child, but my spouse has not been before. He’s a musician and we like old neighborhood vibes versus tourist or kid-centric things (meaning places we can walk around, shop, get coffee, look at houses and people and art, maybe catch daytime music stuff). Bywater seemed to fit the bill for that.

That said, we’ll have a kid who might be toddling by then or alternatively in a stroller; he naps on the go, but it would be great to be able to get back to the hotel to re-up on supplies or rest if needed. Additionally, he’ll be asleep by 8 and we need to be able to chill in location; I’d love if we stayed somewhere with a pool (can you still swim mid-December?) and restaurant/bar on site. Maybe even a kitchenette. No car.

Is Bywater a bad idea given all these restraints? I saw something called bywater suites hotel that looked decent. If so, I’ll probably look at the lower garden district, but wanted to first see if this is a possibility.

*Where the Odds Favor the Bull, but the Bulls Are Bellowing*

The UEFA Europa League group stage kicks off with a clash of Austrian ambition and Portuguese pedigree as Red Bull Salzburg hosts Porto at the Red Bull Arena on September 25, 2025. The odds? Porto is the clear favorite (1.71–1.85, \~55–58% implied probability), while Salzburg sits at 4.45–4.55 (\~22–23%), with a draw priced at 3.7–3.97 (\~25–27%). Let’s unpack why Porto’s odds are as sturdy as a brick wall, Salzburg’s form is about as reliable as a sieve, and why this game might leave goalkeepers wondering if they’ve been paid to stand in the rain.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Bull in a China Shop

Porto’s implied probability of \~58% suggests they’re the team to beat, and the numbers don’t lie. Salzburg, meanwhile, is priced like a longshot bet on a coffee-fueled squirrel to solve quantum physics: possible, but don’t bet your firstborn. The draw sits at \~25%, which is about the same chance as flipping a coin and it landing on its edge.

The over-2.5-goals market is a tantalizing 1.65 (\~60.6% implied probability), meaning bookmakers expect this to be a feast, not a famine. If you’re betting on “both teams to score,” the 1.65 odds imply a 60.6% chance—so grab extra popcorn.

---

### Digesting the News: Porto’s Polish, Salzburg’s Stumbles

Porto arrives in Salzburg riding a six-game domestic winning streak, a tidy 18-point lead in the Primeira Liga, and the fresh tactical wizardry of Italian coach Francesco Farioli. After a rocky FIFA Club World Cup, Farioli is like a turbocharger for a Fiat—suddenly, Porto is a machine. Their defense? Tighter than a drumhead. Their attack? Sharper than a chef’s knife.

Salzburg, though, is a cautionary tale. They’ve lost their last three Bundesliga games, including a 3–1 drubbing by Wolfsberg and a 2–0 thumping by Sturm

First person POV required I just honestly don’t like 3rd person. Something cozy but interesting. 

So, I’ve read a LOT of romances with fantasy as a subplot, so much smut I can do without until I start my 2026 book challenge lol. I don’t want a lot of smut, I want like maybe a few scenes a book, maybe the first book doesn’t even have any smut. 

I’d like this to be set in modern times with modern technology (or more advanced technology would be okay too). Reverse harems or poly are fine, but i would prefer just like an m/f romance. 

I like the concept of fae or shifters living in the human world and the main character catching on or becoming fae/shifters, or even realizing she is one. 

I don’t really like when it’s just regular humans who can do some magic.

I’d prefer it be medium stakes, ideally it would move from low-high stakes throughout the series. I just strongly prefer it to not be world ending stuff all the time, just as much as I hate to find out that after book 2-3 it’s constant smut all of the time. Smut is fine, but I want it to be good for the story not just constant lust thoughts etc. 

An older than 18-20 FMC would be awesome but not required.

I really enjoy this book because it meets a lot of what I want:
 {Inked by Rachel Rener}
It’s incredible, not sure about when there will be actual smut but I’m only on the first book in the series. Set in modern day with modern technology, but als sort of a portal fantasy where they do go back and forth between the realms. The main character is a tattoo artist, which is a unique main character concept I’ve never read before. 

I liked guild codex but would prefer a bit more romance and magic in a different way. I liked(loved) zodiac academy but would prefer a bit less trash reality tv and sex.

Edit to add: not to be too picky, because I know this is already a picky post, but I don’t want like military academy vibes or fighting constantly.

1nqbfkl,https://i.redd.it/qr54aw0h6crf1.jpeg,Does Stroller Suspension Matter ?,"We recently wrote about this on our blog and wanted to share highlights here.

**Don't Overlook Stroller Suspension – It Matters WAY More Than You Think**

I realized something super important that often gets overlooked: suspension and shock absorption.

Everyone talks about foldability, storage, and cup holders (not knocking those—coffee is life), but if you’re planning to actually use your stroller on more than just perfectly paved mall floors, good suspension is a game changer.

Think about it:

* Cracked sidewalks in LA?
* Slushy sidewalks in Minnesota?
* Rocky trails at your favorite park in Colorado?

Without decent suspension, that bumpy ride = cranky baby and sore wrists for you. 😩

**What Even Is Stroller Suspension?**

It’s kinda like what your car has—absorbs shocks and smooths out the ride. With good suspension you get:  
  
✅ Fewer jolts = sleeping baby stays sleeping  
✅ Easier pushing, especially with heavier kids  
✅ More stability, especially on uneven or hilly ground

**Suspension Types (and what they mean IRL):**

* **Spring Suspension** – Common in joggers and all-terrain strollers, super bouncy and great for rougher surfaces.
* **Elastomer Suspension** – Uses rubber materials, smoother on pavement.
* **Full Suspension** – All four wheels absorb shock, ideal for active parents or off-roading.
* **No Suspension** – Basic travel strollers. Fine for the airport, not great for real-world sidewalks.

**Why It Matters Where You Live**

❄️ **Cold states (NY, MN, CO):** Great for snow, slush, icy sidewalks.  
🌴 **Warm/sunny states (CA, FL, TX):** Think sandy beaches, gravel paths, hiking trails.  
🌲 **Rural/suburban (PNW, Midwest):** Dirt roads, grassy parks, rocky trails—this is where suspension *really* shows its worth.

Basically: Wherever you live, good suspension = better naps, smoother walks, and less struggle.

Anyway—if you’re shopping for a stroller, don’t sleep on the suspension. It’s one of those “you don’t know until you know” features.

I looked around the men's boutique shop, my eyes scanning for the perfect gift for my husband; Ryan as it was our 1st anniversary.

Picking up the brown tie that caught my eye, a smile spread across my face. The shop attendant could see that I was pleased.

""I guess this is the one you are going with?"" she questioned; pleased on her part that she'd finally satisfied me.

""Yes, please""

""Then, let me wrap it up for you?""

I handed the tie over to her, ""Thank you""

Whilst the attendant wrapped my gift for Ryan, I couldn't help but remember how we'd first met. It was in a hospital; the same day I'd lost my parents in a car accident.

Ryan happened to have also been involved in a car accident. One thing led to another, I began curious to know the cause of his accidents I'd started working in his house as his caregiver before I knew what was happening next, I was signing a form for a contract marriage with him.

It seemed like a good idea because Ryan seemed like a good guy to me at that time and truthfully, I have never regretted being married to him.

Ryan treats me with respect, way more than I deserved even though our marriage was by name only so this tie I was getting him for our first anniversary didn't even come close for all he's done for me.

""Here you go"" The shop attendant said handing me a disposable bag.

Taking the bag from her hand; I say with a smile, ""Thank you""

As I leave the boutique, I send a quick text to Ryan; ""I'll be at the coffee shop shortly"" it read.

""Take your time"" came his reply but I was giddy as I couldn't contain my happiness.

Climbing into my car, I gently placed the disposable bag at the back of the car seat before taking off.

While humming to my favourite song over the radio, I wondered if today would be a good day to make my feelings known to Ryan.

""You can't be married for over a year without any feelings involved"" I muttered under my breath but was still highly conflicted, ""But what if my confession drives him away? That's the last thing I want to happen right now""

I shake my head, dissing the thought. ""Let's hold back for one more day. You are married to him, Ciara. You can always tell him about your feelings tomorrow""

As the coffee shop we were supposed to meet up in; CARLA'S M came to sight, I shook off the last surge of tension that coursed through my veins as I packed my car in the parking lot before lighting down with the disposable bag in my hands.

Pushing the front door of the coffee shop open, I walked in; my eyes searching frantically for Ryan when suddenly my gaze landed on him.

He was looking at his phone with a worried expression written all over his face. He was claded in a brown suit, his brown hair was neatly styled to the back.

I gawked so hard at this fantasy man in front of me and didn't snap out of it until my phone rang.

Ryan's eyes met mine and immediately, he rushed up to meet me, ""Why didn't you let me know you were here already? I was worried sick""

I smiled shyly, ""I'm sorry""

""Follow me"" Ryan led me to our table where he signaled for the waiter, ""We'll have it now""

""You already ordered?"" I asked Ryan when the waiter was gone.

""You like taking hot coffee after a long drive""

This. This little gestures of Ryan, him remembering what I liked and what I didn't like despite us being in a contract marriage, made me fall in love with him.

On his part it could just be that he was being 'kind' or being a 'nice' guy, maybe it was just me reading too much into his actions, I don't know.

But these feelings of mine, I was ready to keep to myself until Ryan was ready to take the next step with me.

""That's right, I got you something"" We say in unison as I couldn't help but blush at the fact that he remembered what today was.

""You go first"" I say shyly as Ryan brought out a brown envelope from within his bag and handed it over to me.

""What is this?"" I questioned nervously.

Ryan flashed me an encouraging smile, ""Don't be nervous. Go ahead and open it""

I took that as a sign; A good sign that whatever was inside this brown envelope was something I'd like.

It made me more certain about my feeling for Ryan. Today, I thought. I was going to tell him about my feelings for him today.

This envelope, this gift of his to me had only proven that Ryan felt the same way as me and that conclusion made my hands tremble as I opened the envelope.

My eyes met Ryan's once more as I saw a paper inside the brown envelope.

""Continue"" Ryan encouraged and I did. I brought out the paper that was buried inside the envelope and read it's content.

No sooner had I been able to digest the information from the piece of paper, did it fall from my hands.

My whole body began to quiver as I looked up at Ryan who wore a smug or was it? I couldn't tell as my vision was blurred with tears.

""What is the meaning of this?"" I questioned still in disbelief. Where had it all gone wrong? We were happy, he respected me and so did I…I even fell in love with him so how could he do this to me?!.

""It's exactly what it says in the paper, Ciara""

""And what is that?"" I stubbornly inquired. It was as if I didn't want to believe what the paper read until Ryan says it with his own mouth.

A part of me still wanted to fight for whatever we still have left; still wanted to protect our marriage.

But then he'd said it. Ryan had uttered those words I so desperately dreaded,""I want a divorce, Ciara""

Chapter 2: PLEASE, LET MY MAN GO

Ciara

The feeling is quite describable. It was as if one minute I was flying up in the sky and the next minute, I landed hard on the ground without knowing why.

But if it was going to end this way, I needed to know why; I deserved that much courtesy.

""W-Why?"" I inquired with a shaky voice, bringing my hands to dab away at the tears that rolled down my cheeks; I wasn't going to let others watch me cry. Never.

While I was on the verge of a mental breakdown, it iriked me that Ryan; my instigator seemed to be doing just fine.

Ryan shrugged his shoulders, ""Do I need a reason to file for a divorce?""

I clenched my fist stop hard underneath the table; if not, I would have slapped him hard across the face.

""You need a reason if you want me to sign these papers"", I counterattacked. Not that I was going to sign it anyways.

Ryan reclined his back against the chair as he heaved a heavy sigh, ""Let's see. Where do I start from? You are a bad cook, bad when it comes to our personal hygiene. I mean, last time I came home I saw my sock on the kitchen sink. Who does that?""

I tightened my fist, ""It was just that one time and I'd gone on a business trip. Couldn't you take care of that yourself?""

Ryan shook his head; disgusted, ""No. If I could do that myself, why would I have married you?""

I felt my heart fall to my stomach. This man didn't really understand the amount of hurt his words were causing me, ""Then why did you marry me? Did I beg you? No, you are the one who brought up the idea in the first place so why am I suddenly the bad person!?""

""I don't know, you just are!"" Ryan counterattacked,""So back to my reasons…""

""Enough. I've heard enough""

""Wait, this is a really good one. Here it goes.."" Ryan paused,""The king reason for our divorce is most especially for this. You are terrible in bed""

His last words cut me deep like a knife. I let out an exasperated short laugh as I remembered those moments when Ryan would tell me he loves me or peck me softly on the cheeks.

I should have known better than to let myself believe that he was actually in love with me.

The corners of my lips lit up, ""Are you sure I'm the one who is terrible in bed? Last time we checked, you're the one who couldn't get IT up""

Ryan banged his fist on the table; angry, ""Hey!""

""What?!"" I shouted, not caring if we were attracting the crowd, ""Are you the only one who gets to say harsh words? Can't I share my own thoughts?""

I wave the paper Infront of him,""I won't be signing these divorce papers""

I moved to stand up from my seat but Ryan held me back, ""Hey, are you really going to be this way? Why won't you sign the papers? Why?!"" Ryan let out an heavy sigh; he was clearly frustrated, ""Do you want to destroy my happiness?!""

Dear lord, this is way too much for me to handle, ""I'm destroying your happiness?

""Of course!""

""Please can you two take this outside!?"" A customer yelled.

""Exactly!""

""And you ma'am, just sign those papers. Must you be with someone like him?!""

""You can do so much better in my opinion!""

I dabbed at my cheeks as I bowed down; apologizing to the customers, ""I sincerely apologize for ruining your day, everyone""

With that said, I bolted out of the coffee shop; hailing the first taxi that stopped Infront of me and heading straight home.

What a way to remember our first anniversary! And to think I'd bought him a tie!?. Frustrated to the peek, I threw the disposable bag; which housed the tie out the taxi window as I silently sobbed till I got to my destination.

When I'd gotten home, I'd payed the taxi driver whilst dragging my feet to the house front gate.

Memories of when we'd first arrived here threatened to pass through my head; I couldn't help it either.

I'd shared a whole lifetime of mine with this man. Everywhere I went, anything I bought were all bound to remind me of him.

It was going to be hard for me to accept this fact that Ryan was repulsed by me all along but most especially, it was going to be hard for me to move on.

""There has to be something more to this"" I muttered under my breathe, ""Was he being threatened or to do this or…""

I shake my head; clearing the thought off as soon as possible. I couldn't believe that Ryan had hurt me this evening more times than I could count but yet, here I was; Still worried about him.

""Madam.."" A young lady called out to me, approaching me. She was dressed in a yellow long sleeve top and a red skirt just a little bit above her knees.

There was a sling bag over her shoulders. She looked quite familiar…where had I seen her before?.

""Me?""

""Yes, you. Who else would I be speaking to?"" She questioned in a harsh, strong tone; one I didn't like and didn't have the time to tolerate as my world was crashing beneath my feet this evening.

I crossed my arms; ready for a fight, ""Who are you?""

The lady infront of me shoved her phone into my face; relieving pictures of her and my husband, sorry scratch that; Ryan being all lovey dovey together; Sharing kisses, feeding eachother, going to karaokes.

I couldn't seem to understand what was going on this evening; I'd obviously taking more than I could chew so when does it end!?

""Who am I, you asked?"" The lady questioned, ""I'm Ryan's girlfriend. I came to you to ask you for just one favor""

She held my hands as if her life depended on it, ""Please, let my man go""

Chapter 3: SEE YOU IN COURT

Ciara

It felt as if I'd just be hit over by a brick; or was it something worse? I don't know. All I knew was that right now..right Infront of me was proof that my husband has been cheating on me all along.

""Aren't you going to say something? Cat's got your tongue?"" The lady, Anne Infront of me questioned furiously.

It was such a shame that she thought I was the one who stole something from her and not the other way around.

I scoffed absentmindedly muttering under my breath,""So Ryan even kept me a secret all the while from the women he played with?""

""What did you say?""

Shaking my head; I voiced out aloud, ""I've heard you so for now, can you please go?""

I had a lot to deal with already and I'd clearly decided that I've had enough for one day so with that said, I'd turned away from her heading into the house but Anne had grabbed my wrist; holding me back, ""Hey, I'm not done yet!""

There and then, I lost my cool. All my pent up frustration and anger I'd bottled up all evening finally exploded.

""Please!"" I shouted breaking down into tears, ""Please, just go""

Shaking her wrist off me, I head into the house; slamming the door shut as I crumbled down to the ground, wailing in my own sorrow and misery.

Why was this happening to me? Why?. Placing my hands over my mouth, I tried to stiffle my tears but the more I tried, the more my tears flowed.

As I struggled to get back on my feet, I decides that I've had enough. Enough of Ryan, enough of this house, enough of everything.

Making my way to what used to be our bedroom, I brought out my traveling box from ontop the wardrobe.

Flinging the wardrobe wide open, I threw my clothes into the box in a frenzy with teary eyes.

This. This was going to be the last time anyone hurt me this way again. I swear it.

While packing up my belongings, I heard the main door open but didn't even bother to look in it's direction because was certain that it was no other than Ryan.

""Are you finally leaving?"" Ryan questioned with a mocking tone.

Just when I decided to spare him a glance, I saw 'her' beside him. I scoffed. So he was going as far as bringing her into our house now?.

Shaking my head, I diverted my gaze away from them; dragging my box closer to my drawer as I threw my jewelleries in.

Ryan held my hand as if stopping me but his gesture only iriked me.

""Would you let go off me!""

""I don't want to touch you either but where do you think you are taking those jewelleries to?. I was the one who bought them for you!""

I laughed. For the first time since the events of this disastrous evening played out, I had a good laugh.

""You bought it for me?"" I questioned, ""Don't be absurd. You didn't even buy me a single flower talkless of these jewelleries"" I free myself from his grasp as I continued with what I was doing.

When I was all packed up, I angrily threw the divorce paper that had been in my hands all evening on the reading table and scribbled my signature across it.

""Aren't you being too absurd?"" Anne questioned with irritation all over her face.

It took every bit of self control in my body for me not to hit her. She's the one who had ruined our one year of marriage, what seemed to be the perfect marriage I could ever imagine.

What right did she have to be irritated?!.

""I mean.."" Anne dragged out regardless, ""You two weren't even in a real marriage""

I knew it. She knew Ryan was married. Afterall, why wouldn't she? She was the reason behind Ryan and I's contractual marriage.

Whilst I'd worked as a caregiver for Ryan, his mother had forced him into getting married with Anne but he didn't want to and rather we'd gotten married.

Now seeing Ryan with the girl he'd used me for did kind of sting.

Anne scoffed, ""Don't tell me you actually fell in love with Ryan now, did you?""

I did and trust me, I regret every single moment of it, ""No, why would I? Ryan isn't actually someone who deserves love. Isn't that why you are with him?""

""Hey!""

""Listen to me good and listen well. Just because Ryan and I just got divorced because of you doesn't mean he actually loves you. He cheated on me despite being in a fake relationship as you've said so can you imagine what's going to happen to you?""

Ryan pushed me backwards,""Hey, if you are done packing your things then hurry up and leave. I won't tolerate you talking down at me in my own house""

""In your own house?"" I inquired gazing around the house I'd built with my hard earned money and sweat,""The whole plot of land, the house, 1.3billion dollars, the cars…""

""Hey, what are you saying?"" Ryan stuttered.

""What? Are you scared? Or is it now you remember that you didn't contribute a dime into our marriage? Don't worry, you won't be penniless. You and your girlfriend can feed and grow on your 'love' daily""

""And to be honest, you are quite well off too. Your company is doing well for the now so, remember all I said before? That's just a tip of the iceberg on the divorce alimony""

I pressed his shoulder down as I whispered into his ears, ""So honey, make sure to come with a good lawyer and try to fight me for all the things you didn't work hard for. I'll be waiting""

I bowed at Anne, ""I wish you two a happy married life or whatever you want to do yourselves""

Turning back to face Ryan, I flashed him a sweet smile. A smile of victory because I was finally convinced that even if I was going down, I wasn't going down in shame.

1nqbakc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqbakc,Moving on | Day 4,"A pleasant day my dear readers, friends, brothers, and everyone who cares a damn about me (woo)

It is I, Chay. You know who I am but for those reading, it is Day 4 (well week 4 but who's counting)

It has been quite an eventful few days. I've guilt tripped everyone last time so what did I get into?

Yo face reveal (you all seen me before dw)
It's been raining frequently, and as I'm writing this, a big storm is about to hit so maybe that's gonna be fun (I'm keeping safe I'm okay)
I passed by this decor of umbrellas fitting the weather and the colors made me smile a little. 
The hallway in my university did not at all. Very creepy.

Fun little piece of information about me, my dad is a bartender, really good one. But I don't drink at all. I only do so at events and parties, but I don't indulge in it. I do one drink at most. Bar looks cool tho. My vice is of course coffee and well, cool drinks and snacks. I've met up again with my friends after class and opened up to them about recent events. They did their best to help but they knew it won't really do much. 

 Went back to the fancy part of town. Cool buildings, serene landscape, but rainy. Was looking for some places to do Karaoke sometime soon. Maybe blow off steam after the whole heartbreak. Visited my doctor for a check up and asked if I felt different. If there is something bothering me. Of course I can't lie in front of my mom and the doctor, so I had to tell the news again. It helped a bit. She was understanding.

More alcohol tryna persuade me in the Costco version here in my country, but just looks cool in my opinion. I imagined being that guy holding an umbrella to what I would imagine is his girlfriend. How sweet.

Went around town. Saw the cool building people keep on raving about. Stopped by a Krispy Kreme and tried their new donuts from the Harry Potter universe. Got a Gryffindor one and a coffee, was honestly the best time of the week. Just a chill moment. 

I want to take this moment to thank everyone who gave me such good advice, kind words, and encouragement to keep on going. People like Erick, Adri, Adam, and my lil brother Neo, you all truly helped me see things in a clearer light and move on step by step. 

As I'm writing this too, congratulations to Suzy for such a high honor in the Gallery. Your talent inspires me to live life creatively :)

I turned on my computer before I end this entry, maybe I can get some juices flowing to write another chapter for the YH AU, but one can truly dream.

I remembered a line I wrote my character Kaelen said, he told Eryn: “Maybe in another life, Eryn. You’d be the prince. And I’d be the 
blacksmith hiding in a vineyard.”

I'd rather be a blacksmith healing and moving on rather than a prince with a false crown and no princess to call home...

Day 4 is complete. I wonder...

Much love, Chay :3

  I had my back to the room as I stared out the window. It was a trick I’d learned from my mother to make me seem more in control. Elora had given me lots of tips the past few months, but the ones about commanding a meeting were the most useful.  
  
  “Princess, I think you’re being naïve,” the Chancellor said. “You can’t turn the entire society on its head.”  
  
  “I’m not.” I turned back, giving him a cool gaze, and he lowered his eyes and balled up his handkerchief in his hand. “But we can’t ignore the problems any longer.”  
  
  I surveyed the meeting room, doing my best to seem as cold and imposing as Elora always had. I didn’t plan to be a cruel ruler, but they wouldn’t listen to weakness. If I wanted to make a change here, I had to be firm.  
  
  Since Elora had become incapacitated as of late, I’d been running the day to day activities of the palace, including a lot of meetings. The board of advisors seemed to take up a lot of my time.  
  
  The Chancellor had been voted into his position by the Trylle people, but as soon as his term was up, I planned to campaign against him as hard as I could. He was a conniving coward, and we needed somebody much stronger in his position.  
  
  Garrett Strom – my mother’s “confidant” – was here today, but he didn’t always come. Depending on how Elora was doing that day, he often chose to stay and care for her instead of attending these meetings.  
  
  My assistant Joss sat at the back of the room, furiously scribbling down notes as we talked. She was a small human girl that grew up in Förening as a mänsklig and worked as Elora’s secretary. Since I’d been running the palace, I’d inherited Joss as my own assistant.  
  
  Duncan, my bodyguard, was stationed by the door, where he stood during all the meetings. He followed me everywhere, like a shadow, and though he was clumsy and small, he was smarter than people gave him credit for. I’d grown to respect and appreciate his presence the last few months, even if he couldn’t completely take the place of my last guard, Finn Holmes.  
  
  Aurora Kroner sat at the head of the table, next to her was Tove, my fiancé. He was usually the only one on my side, and I was grateful to have him here. I don’t know how I would manage ruling if I felt completely alone.  
  
  Also in attendance were Marksinna Laurent, a woman I didn’t particularly trust, but she was one of the most influential people in Förening; Markis Bain, who was in charge of changeling placement; Markis Court, the treasurer for the palace; and Thomas Holmes, the head guard in charge of all the security and trackers.  
  
  A few other high-ranking officials sat around the table, all of their expressions solemn. The situation for the Trylle was growing increasingly dire, and I was proposing change. They didn’t want me to change anything – they wanted me to support the system they’d had for centuries, but that system wasn’t working anymore. Our society was crumbling, and they refused to see the roles they played in it.  
  
  “With all due respect, Princess,” Aurora began, her voice so sweet, I could barely hear the venom underneath, “we have bigger issues at hand. The Vittra are only getting stronger, and with the embargo about to end-”  
  
  “The embargo,” Marksinna Laurent snorted, cutting her off. “Like that’s done us any good.”  
  
  “The embargo isn’t over yet,” I said, standing up straighter. “Our trackers are out taking care of the problems now, which is why I think it’s so important that we have something in place for them when they return.”  
  
  “We can worry about that when they return,” the Chancellor said. “Let’s deal with saving our asses right now.”  
  
  “I’m not asking to redistribute the wealth or call for abolishing the monarchy,” I said. “I am simply saying that the trackers are out there risking their lives to save us, to protect our changelings, and they deserve a real house to come back to. We should be setting aside money now so that when this is over, we can begin building them real homes.”  
  
  “As noble as that is, Princess, we should be saving the money for the Vittra,” Markis Bain said.  
  
  “We can’t pay the Vittra off,” Tove interjected. “This isn’t about money. This is about power. We all know what they want, and a few thousand – or even a few million – dollars won’t matter to them. The Vittra King will refuse it.”  
  
  “I will do everything in my power to keep Förening safe, but you are all right,” I said. “We have yet to find a reasonable solution for the Vittra. That means this might very well turn into a bloody fight, and if it does, we need to support our troops. They deserve the best care, including adequate housing and access to our healers if they’re injured in wartime.”  
  
  “Healers on a tracker?” Marksinna Laurent laughed, and a few others chuckled along with her. “Don’t be ridiculous.”  
  
  “Why is that ridiculous?” I asked, working to keep the ice from my voice. “They are expected to die for us, but we aren’t willing to heal their wounds? We cannot ask more of them than we are willing to give ourselves.”  
  
  “They are lower than us,” Laurent said, as if I didn’t understand the concept. “We are in charge for a reason. Why on Earth should we treat them as equals when they are not?”  
  
  “Because it’s basic decency,” I argued. “We may not be human, but that doesn’t mean we have to be devoid of humanity. This is why our people are leaving our cities and preferring to live amongst the humans, letting their powers die. We must offer them some bit of happiness, otherwise why would they stay?”  
  
  Laurent muttered something under her breath, keeping her steely eyes locked on the oak table. Her black hair was slicked back, pulled in a bun so tight her face looked strained. This was probably done on purpose.  
  
  Marksinna Laurent was a very powerful Trylle, able to produce and control fire, and something that strong was draining. Trylle powers weakened them, taking some of their life and aging them preternaturally.  
  
  But if the Trylle didn’t use them, the abilities did something to their minds, eating at their thoughts and making them crazy. This was especially true for Tove, who would appear scattered and rude if he didn’t use his psychokinesis.  
  
  “It is time for a change,” Tove said, speaking up when the room had fallen into an annoyed silence. “It can be gradual, but it’s going to happen.”  
  
  A knock at the door stop  
ped anyone from giving him a rebuttal, but from the beet-red color of the Chancellor’s face, it looked like he had a few words he wanted to get out.  
  
  Duncan opened the door, and Willa poked her head in, smiling uncertainly. Since she was a Marksinna, Garrett’s daughter, and my best friend, she had every right to be here. I’d extended an invitation for her to attend these meetings, but she always declined, saying she was afraid she would do more harm than good. She had a much harder time being polite when she disagreed with people.  
  
  “Sorry,” Willa said, and Duncan stepped aside so she could come in. “I didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just that it’s after five, and I was supposed to get the Princess at three for her birthday celebration.”  
  
  I glanced at the clock, realizing this had worn on much longer than I’d originally planned. Willa walked over to me and gave the room an apologetic smile, but I knew she’d drag me out kicking and screaming if I didn’t put an end to the meeting.  
  
  “Ah, yes,” the Chancellor smiled at me with a disturbing hunger in his eyes. “I’d forgotten that you’ll be eighteen tomorrow.” He licked his lips, and Tove stood up, purposely blocking the Chancellor’s view of me.  
  
  “Sorry, everyone,” Tove said, “but the Princess and I have plans this evening. We’ll pick this meeting up next week then?”  
  
  “You’re going back to work next week?” Laurent looked appalled. “So soon after your wedding? Aren’t you and the Princess taking a honeymoon?”  
  
  “With the state of things, I don’t think it’s wise,” I said. “I have too much to get done here.”  
  
  While that was true enough, that wasn’t the only reason I’d skipped out on a honeymoon. As much as I’d grown to like Tove, I couldn’t imagine what the two of us would do on one. I hadn’t even let myself think about how we would spend our wedding night.  
  
  “We need to go over the changeling contracts,” Markis Bain said, standing up in a hurry. “Since the trackers are bringing the changelings back early, and some families decline to do changelings anymore, the placements have all been moved around. I need you to sign off on them.”  
  
  “Enough talk of business.” Willa looped her arm through mine, preparing to lead me out from the room. “The Princess will be back to work on Monday, and she can sign anything you want then.”  
  
  “Willa, it will only take a second to sign them,” I said, but she glared at me, so I gave Bain a polite smile. “I will look them over first thing Monday morning.”  
  
  Tove walked with us into the hall, and even though we were out of the meeting, Willa still kept her arm through mine as we walked. Duncan stayed a step behind us when we were in the South Wing. I’d gotten talked to many, many times about how I couldn’t treat Duncan as an equal while business was being conducted, and there were Trylle officials at work around us.  
  
  “Princess?” Joss said, scampering behind me with papers spilling out of her binder. “Princess, do you want me to arrange a meeting on Monday with Markis Bain for the contracts?”  
  
  “Yes, that would be fantastic,” I said, slowing so I could talk to her. “Thank you, Joss.”  
  
  “You have a meeting at ten a.m. with the Markis of Oslinna.” Joss flipped through the appointment section of the binder, and a paper flew out. Duncan snatched it before it fell to the ground and handed it to her. “Thank you. Sorry. So, Princess, do you want to meet Markis Bain before or after that meeting?”  
  
  “She’ll just be going back to work from getting married,” Willa said. “Of course, she won’t want to come in first thing in the morning. Make it for the afternoon.”  
  
  I glanced over at Tove walking next to me, but his expression was blank. Since proposing to me, he’d actually spoken very little of getting married. His mother and Willa had done most of the planning, so I hadn’t even talked to him about what he thought of colors or flower arrangements. Everything had been decided for us, so we had little to discuss.  
  
  “Does two in the afternoon work for you?” Joss asked.  
  
  “Yes, that would be perfect,” I said. “Thanks, Joss.”  
  
  “Alright.” Joss stopped to hurriedly scribble down the time in the binder.  
  
  “Now she’s off until Monday,” Willa told Joss over her shoulder. “That means five whole days where nobody calls her, talks to her, or meets with her. Remember that, Joss. If anybody asks for the Princess, she cannot be reached.”  
  
  “Yes, of course, Marksinna Strom,” Joss smiled. “Happy birthday, Princess, and good luck with your wedding!”  
  
  “I can’t believe how much of a workaholic you are,” Willa sighed as we walked away. “When you’re Queen, I’ll never see you at all.”  
  
  “Sorry,” I said. “I tried to get out of the meeting sooner, but things have been getting out of hand lately.”  
  
  “That Laurent is driving me batty,” Tove said, grimacing at the thought of her. “When you’re Queen, you should banish her.”  
  
  “When I’m Queen, you’ll be King,” I pointed out. “You can banish her yourself.”  
  
  “Well, wait until you see what we have planned for you tonight,” Duncan grinned. “You’ll be having too much fun to worry about Laurent or anybody else.”  
  
  Fortunately, since I was getting married in a few days, I’d gotten out of the usual ball that would happen for a Princess’s birthday. Elora had an agreement with Aurora that the wedding take place immediately after I turn eighteen. My birthday was on a Wednesday, and I was getting married on Saturday, leaving no time for a massive Trylle birthday party.  
  
  Willa insisted on throwing me a small party anyway, even though I didn’t really want one. Considering everything that was happening in Förening, it felt like sacrilege. The Vittra had set up a peace treaty with us, saying they wouldn’t attack us until I became Queen. What we hadn’t realized at the time was the specific language they had used. They wouldn’t attack us, meaning the Trylle living in Förening. Everyone else was fair game.  
  
  The Vittra had started going after our changelings, the ones that were still left with their host families in human society. They’d taken a few before we caught on, but as soon as we did, we sent all our best trackers in the field to bring home any changeling over the age of sixteen. Any younger than that, our trackers were supposed to stand guard and watch them. They couldn’t take them without setting off an Amber Alert, so the Vittra avoided taking them too.  
  
  That left us at a horrible disadvantage. To protect the changelings, our trackers had to be in the field, so they couldn’t be here guarding the palace. We would be more exposed to an attack if the Vittra went back on our deal, but I didn’t see what choice we had. We couldn’t let them kidnap and hurt children, so I sent every tracker I could out into the field.  
  
  Finn had been gone almost continuously for months. He was the best tracker we had, and he’d been returning the changelings to all the Trylle communities. I hadn’t seen him since before Christmas, and although I still missed him, it was probably better this way.  
  
  I was marrying someone else, and even though I loved Finn, I had to put that behind me and move past it.  
  
  “Where is this party happening anyway?” I asked Willa, pushing thoughts of Finn from my mind.  
  
  “Upstairs,” Willa said, leading me toward the grand staircase in the front hall. “Matt’s up there putting on the finishing touches.”  
  
  “Finishing touches?” I raised an eyebrow.  
  
  Someone pounded on the front door, making the door shake. They knocked so hard that the chandelier above us began to tremble. Normally people rang a doorbell, but they were nearly beating down the door.  
  
  “Stay back, Princess,” Duncan said as he walked over to the door.  
  
  “Duncan, I can get it,” I said.  
  
  If somebody hit the door hard enough to make the front hall quake, I was afraid of what they would do to him. I made a move for the door, but Willa stopped me.  
  
  “Wendy, let him,” she said firmly. “You and Tove will be here if he needs you.”  
  
  “No.” I pulled myself from her grip and went after Duncan, to defen  
d him if I needed to.  
  
  That sounded silly since he was supposed to be my bodyguard, but I was more powerful than him. He was really only meant to serve as a human shield if need be, but I would never let him do that.  
  
  When he opened the door, I was right behind him. Duncan meant to only partially open the door so he could see what waited for us outside, but a gust of wind came up, blowing it open, and sending snow swirling around the front hall.  
  
  A blast of cold air struck me, but it died down almost instantly. Willa could control the wind when she wanted to, so as soon as it blew inside the palace, she raised her hand to silence it.  
  
  A figure stood in the doorway, bracing himself with his hands on either side of the door. He was slumped forward, his head hanging down, and snow covered his black sweater. His clothes were ragged, worn, and shredded in most places.  
  
  “Can we help you?” Duncan asked.  
  
  “I need the Princess,” he said, and as soon as I heard his voice, a shiver shot through me.  
  
  “Loki?” I gasped.  
  
  “Princess?” Loki lifted his head. He smiled crookedly, but it didn’t have his usual bravado. His caramel eyes were tired and pained, and he had a fading bruise on his cheek.  
  
  “What happened to you?” I asked. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  “I apologize for the intrusion, Princess,” he said, his smile already fading. “And as much as I’d like to say that I’m here for pleasure, I…” He swallowed something back, and his hands gripped tighter onto the doorframe.  
  
  “Are you alright?” I asked, pushing past Duncan.  
  
  “I…” Loki started to speak, but his knees gave out. He pitched forward, and I rushed to catch him. He fell into my arms, and I lowered him to the ground.  
  
  “Loki?” I brushed the hair back from his eyes, and they fluttered open.  
  
  “Princess.” He smiled up at me, but it was weak. “If I’d known that this is what it would take to get you to hold me, I would’ve collapsed a long time ago.”  
  
  “What is going on, Loki?” I asked gently. If he hadn’t been so obviously distressed, I would’ve swatted him for that comment, but he grimaced in pain when I touched his face.

Amnesty,” he said thickly, and his eyes closed. “I need amnesty, Princess.” His head tilted to the side, and his body relaxed. He’d passed out.  
  
  2. Birthday  
  
  Tove and Duncan had carried Loki up to the servants’ quarters on the second floor. Willa went back to help Matt so he wouldn’t worry, and I sent Duncan to get Thomas because I had no idea what we should do with Loki. He was unconscious, so I couldn’t ask him what happened.  
  
  “Are you going to give him amnesty?” Tove asked. He stood next to me with his arms folded over his chest, staring down at Loki.  
  
  “I don’t know.” I shook my head. “It depends on what he says.” I glanced over at Tove. “Why? Do you think I should?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” he said finally. “But I will support any decision you make.”  
  
  “Thank you,” I said, but I hadn’t expected any different from him. “Can you see if there’s a doctor that will look at him?”  
  
  “You don’t want me to get my mother?” Tove asked. His mother was a healer, meaning she could put her hands on someone and heal almost any wound they might have.  
  
  “No. She would never heal a Vittra. Besides, I don’t want anyone to know that Loki is here. Not yet,” I said. “I need an actual doctor. There is a mänks doctor in town, isn’t there?”  
  
  “Yeah,” he nodded. “I’ll get him.” He turned to leave but paused at the door. “You’ll be okay with him?”  
  
  “Yes, of course,” I smiled.  
  
  Tove nodded, then left me alone with Loki. I took a deep breath and tried to figure out what to do. Loki lay on his back, his light hair cascading across his forehead. Somehow he was even more attractive asleep than he was awake.  
  
  He hadn’t stirred at all when they’d carried him up, and Duncan had jostled and nearly dropped him many times. Loki had always dressed well, and while his clothes looked like they had once been nice, they were little more than rags now.  
  
  I sat down on the edge of the bed next to him and touched a hole in his shirt. The skin underneath was discolored and swollen. Tentatively, I lifted his shirt, and when Loki didn’t stir, I pushed it up more.  
  
  I felt strange and almost perverse undressing him, but I wanted to check and make sure there weren’t obvious contusions. If he were seriously injured, like with broken ribs poking out of his skin, I would summon Aurora and make her heal him, whether she wanted to or not. I wouldn’t let Loki die because she was prejudiced.  
  
  After I pulled his shirt over his head, I got my first good look at him, and my breath caught in my throat. Under ordinary circumstances, I’m sure his physique would be stunning, but that’s not what shocked me. His torso was covered with bruises, and his sides had long, thin scars on them.  
  
  They wrapped around, so I lifted him a bit, and his back was covered with them. They crisscrossed all over his skin, some of them older, but most of them appeared red and fresh.  
  
  Tears stung my eyes, and I put my hand to my mouth. I’d never seen Loki shirtless before, but he even had scars on his forearms, and they weren’t there before. This had all happened since I saw him last.  
  
  Worse still, Loki had Vittra blood. Physically, he was incredibly strong, which is how he’d pounded at the door so hard it shook the front hall. That also meant he healed better than most. For him to look this terrible, somebody really had to beat the hell out of him, over and over again, so he wouldn’t have time to heal.  
  
  A jagged scar stretched across his chest, as if someone had tried to stab him, and it reminded me of my own scar that ran along my stomach. My host mother had tried to kill me when I was a child, but that felt like a lifetime ago.  
  
  I touched Loki’s chest, running my fingers over the bumps of his scar. I don’t know why exactly, but I felt compelled to, as if the scar made us kindred spirits.  
  
  “You just couldn’t wait to get me naked, could you, Princess?” Loki asked tiredly. I started to pull my hand back, but he put his own hand over it, keeping it in place.  
  
  “No, I – I was checking for wounds,” I stumbled and wouldn’t meet his gaze.  
  
  “I’m sure.” He moved his thumb, almost caressing my hand, until it hit my ring. “What’s that?” He tried to sit up to see it, so I lifted my hand, showing him the emerald encrusted oval on my finger. “Is that a wedding ring?”  
  
  “No, engagement.” I lowered my hand, resting it on the bed next to him. “I’m not married yet.”  
  
  “I’m not too late, then,” he smiled and settled back in the bed.  
  
  “Too late for what?” I asked.  
  
  “To stop you, of course.” Still smiling, he closed his eyes.  
  
  “Is that why you’re here?” I asked, failing to point out how near we were to my nuptials.  
  
  “I told you why I’m here,” Loki said.  
  
  “What happened to you, Loki?” I asked, my voice growing thick when I thought about what he had to have gone through to get all those marks and bruises.  
  
  “Are you crying, Princess?” Loki asked and opened his eyes.  
  
  “No, I’m not crying.” I wasn’t, but my eyes were moist.  
  
  “Don’t cry.” He tried to sit up, but he winced when he lifted his head, so I put my hand gently on his chest to keep him down.  
  
  “You need to rest,” I said.  
  
  “I will be fine.” He put his hand over mine again, and I let him. “Eventually.”  
  
  “Can you tell me what happened?” I asked. “Why do you need amnesty?”  
  
  “Remember when we were in the garden?” Loki asked.  
  
  Of course I remembered. Loki had snuck in over the wall and asked me to run away with him. I had declined, but he’d stolen a kiss before he left, a rather nice kiss. My cheeks reddened slightly at the memory, and that made Loki smile wider.  
  
  “I see you do,” he grinned.  
  
  “What does that have to do with anything?” I asked.  
  
  “That doesn’t,” Loki said, referring to the kiss. “I meant when I told you that the King hates me. He really does, Princess.” His eyes went dark for a minute.  
  
  “The Vittra King did this to you?” I asked, and my stomach tightened. “You mean Oren? My father?”  
  
  “Don’t worry about it now,” he said, trying to calm the anger inside me. “I’ll be fine.”  
  
  “Why?” I asked. “Why does the King hate you? Why did he do this to you?”  
  
  “Princess, please.” He closed his eyes. “I’m exhausted. I barely made it here. Can we have this conversation when I’m feeling a bit better? Say, in a month or two?”  
  
  “Loki,” I sighed, but he had a point. “Rest. But we will talk tomorrow. Alright?”  
  
  “As you wish, Princess,” he conceded, and he was already drifting back to sleep again.  
  
  I sat beside him for a few minutes longer, my hand still on his chest so I could feel his heartbeat pounding underneath. When I was certain he was asleep, I slid my hand out from under his, and I stood up.  
  
  In the hall, I wrapped my arms around myself. I couldn’t shake the heavy guilt I felt, as if I somehow shared responsibility for what happened to Loki. I’d only spoken to Oren once, and I had no control over what he did. So why did I feel like it was my fault that Loki had been so brutally beaten?  
  
  I wasn’t in the hall for long when Duncan and Thomas approached. I’d wanted to alert as few people as possible about Loki’s presence, but I trusted Thomas. Not just because he was the head guard or Finn’s father. He’d once had an illicit affair with Elora, so I thought he was good at keeping secrets.  
  
  “The Vittra Markis is in there?” Thomas asked, but he was already looking past me into the room where Loki slept.  
  
  “Yes, but he’s been through hell,” I said, rubbing my arms as if I had a chill. “He’s going to be out for a while.”  
  
  “Duncan said he asked for amnesty.” Thomas looked down at me. “Are you going to give it to him?”  
  
  “I’m not sure yet,” I said. “He hasn’t been able to talk much. But I’m letting him stay here for now, at least until he heals and we can have a conversation.”  
  
&nb  
sp; “How do you want us to handle this?” Thomas asked.  
  
  “We can’t tell Elora. Not right now,” I said.  
  
  The last time Loki had been here, he’d been held captive. We don’t have a real prison, so Elora had used her telekinesis to hold him in place, but that had weakened her so much it nearly killed her. In fact, she hadn’t recovered from it yet, and there would be no way she could do it again.  
  
  Besides that, I didn’t think Loki was really capable of causing trouble. Not in this state, at least. And he’d come to us of his own free will. We didn’t need to hold him.  
  
  “We need a guard stationed outside his door at all times, just to be safe,” I said. “I don’t think he’s a threat, but I won’t take any chances with the Vittra.”  
  
  “I can stand watch now, but somebody will have to relieve me of my post eventually,” Thomas said.  
  
  “I can take over later,” Duncan offered.  
  
  “No.” Thomas shook his head. “You stay with the Princess.”  
  
  “Do you have any other guards you can trust?” I asked.  
  
  Most of the guards seemed to be gossips, and when one of them heard something, they all knew it. But there were very few guards around to tell anymore, since most of them were out protecting changelings.  
  
  “I know of one or two,” Thomas nodded.  
  
  “Good,” I said. “Make sure they know they cannot tell anybody about this. This all needs to stay quiet until I figure out what I’m going to do. Is that clear?”  
  
  “Yes, Your Highness,” Thomas said. It always felt strange hearing people refer to me as Highness.  
  
  “Thank you,” I told him.  
  
  Tove arrived shortly after that with the mänks doctor. I waited outside the room while he examined Loki. He woke up for it, but offered very little explanation for his injuries. When he was done, the doctor concluded that Loki didn’t have any serious ailments, and he gave him medication for pain.  
  
  “Come on,” Tove said, after the doctor had gone. “He’s resting now. There’s nothing more you can do. Why don’t you go enjoy your party?”  
  
  “I’ll let you know if there’s any change with him,” Thomas promised.  
  
  “Thank you,” I nodded, and walked down the hall with Tove and Duncan toward my room.  
  
  I hadn’t felt like having a party before Loki crashed the palace, and I felt even less like having one now. But I had to at least try to have fun so I didn’t hurt Willa or Matt’s feelings. I know they had gone to a lot of trouble for it, so I would play the part of the happy birthday girl for them.  
  
  “The doctor thinks he’ll be okay,” Duncan said, responding to my solemn expression.  
  
  “I know,” I said.  
  
  “Why are you so worried about him anyway?” Duncan asked. “I know that you two are friends or something, but I don’t understand. He’s a Vittra, and he kidnapped you once.”  
  
  “I’m not worried,” I cut him off and forced a smile. “I’m excited for the party.”  
  
  Duncan directed me to the upstairs living room. It had been Rhys’s playroom when he was little, but they’d converted it into a place to hang out when he became a teenager. But the ceilings had murals of clouds and childish things, and the walls were lined with short white shelves that still held a few of his old toys.  
  
  When I opened the door, I was bombarded by streamers and balloons. A banner with the words “Happy Birthday” in giant glitter letters hung on the back wall.  
  
  “Happy birthday!” Willa shouted before I could step inside.  
  
  “Happy birthday!” Rhys and Rhiannon said in unison.  
  
  “Thanks, guys,” I said, pushing a helium-filled balloon out of my face so I could go in. “You guys know my birthday isn’t actually until tomorrow?”  
  
  “Of course I know,” Matt said, his voice a little high from inhaling helium. He had a deflated balloon in his hands, the source of the helium, and he tossed it aside to walk over to me. “I was there when you were born, remember?”  
  
  He’d been smiling, but it faltered when he realized what he’d said. Rhys and I had been switched at birth. Matt had actually been there for Rhys’s birth, not mine.  
  
  “Well, I was there when you came home from the hospital anyway,” Matt said and hugged me. “Happy birthday.”  
  
  “Thank you,” I said, hugging him back.  
  
  “And I definitely know your birthday,” Rhys said, walking over to us. “Happy birthday!”  
  
  “Happy birthday to you too,” I smiled. “How does it feel to be eighteen?”  
  
  “Pretty much exactly the same as it does being seventeen,” Rhys laughed. “Do you feel any older?”  
  
  “No, not really,” I admitted.  
  
  “Oh, come on,” Matt said. “You’ve matured so much in the past six months. I hardly even recognize you anymore.”  
  
  “I’m still me, Matt,” I said, shifting uneasily from his compliment.  
  
  I knew that I’d grown up some. Even physically, I’d changed. I wore my hair down more now because I finally managed to tame my curls after a lifetime of struggling with them. Since I was running a kingdom now, I had to play the part and wear dark-colored gowns all the time. I had to look like a Princess.  
  
  “It’s a good thing, Wendy,” Matt smiled at me.  
  
  “Stop.” I waved my hand. “No more seriousness. This is supposed to be a party.”  
  
  “Party!” Rhys shouted and blew on one of those cardboard horns they used on New Year’s.  
  
  Once the party got underway, I actually did have fun. This was much better than if I’d had a ball, since most of the people here wouldn’t be able to go. Matt wasn’t even supposed to live in the palace, and since Rhys and Rhiannon were mänks, they would never be allowed to attend a ball. Duncan would be let in, but he’d have to work. He wouldn’t be able to laugh and goof around like he did here.  
  
  “Wendy, why don’t you help me cut the cake?” Willa suggested while Tove attempted to act out some kind of clue for charades. Duncan had guessed everything under the sun, but he wasn’t even close.  
  
  “Um, sure,” I said.  
  
  I’d been sitting on the couch, laughing at everyone’s failed attempts, but I got up and went over to the table where Willa stood. A cake sat on a brightly colored tablecloth, next to a small pile of gifts. Both Rhys and I had specifically asked for no gifts, but here they were.  
  
  “Sorry,” Willa said. “I didn’t mean to drag you away from the fun, but I wanted to talk to you.”  
  
  “Nah, it’s okay,” I shrugged it off.  
  
  “Your brother made the cake.” Willa gave me an apologetic smile as she sliced through the white frosting. “He insisted that it was your favorite.”  
  
  Matt might be a very good cook, but I wasn’t sure. I dislike most food, especially processed ones, but Matt had been trying hard to feed me for years, so I pretended to like a lot of things I didn’t like. My birthday cake was one of them.  
  
  “It’s not horrible,” I said, but it kind of was. At least to me, and Willa and all the other Trylle.  
  
  “I wanted to let you know that I didn’t tell Matt about Loki.” Willa lowered her voice as she carefully put pieces of cake on small paper plates. “He would just worry.”  
  
  “Thank you,” I said, and looked back over at Matt, laughing at the ridiculous miming Tove was doing. “I suppose I’ll have to tell him eventually.”  
  
  “You think Loki will be around for a while?” Willa asked. She’d gotten some frosting on her finger, and she licked it off, then grimaced.  
  
  “Yeah, I think he will be,” I nodded.  
  
  “Well, don’t worry about it now,” she said quickly. “This is your last day to be a kid!”  
  
  I tried to push all of my fears and concerns I had about the kingdom, and Loki, from my mind. And eventually, when I let myself, I had a really good time with my friends.  
  
  3. Scars  
  
  My dreams were filled with bad winter storms. Snow blowing so hard I couldn’t see anything. Wind so cold I froze to the bone. But I had to keep going. I had to get through the storms.  
  
  Duncan woke me up a little after  
nine the morning. Usually, I got up at six or seven to get ready for the day, depending on what time my first meetings were. Since it was my birthday, I’d slept in a bit, and it felt nice but strange.  
  
  He wouldn’t have woken me at all, except Elora requested to eat breakfast with me today since it was my birthday. I didn’t mind being woken up, though. Sleeping in that late made me feel surprisingly lazy.  
  
  I didn’t even really know what I would do with the day. It’d been so long since I had a full day that was free of plans. Either I was working on things for the kingdom, helping Aurora with the wedding plans, or spending time with Willa and Matt.  
  
  I met Elora in her bedroom for breakfast, which was usually where I saw her. She’d been in decline for a while, but even before Christmas, she’d been on bed rest. Aurora had tried healing her a few times, but she was only staving off the inevitable.  
  
  On my way to Elora’s chambers in the South Wing, I walked past the room Loki was staying in. His bedroom door was closed, and Thomas stood guard outside. He nodded once as I walked by, so I assumed everything was still going alright.  
  
  Elora’s bedroom was massive. The double doors into her room were floor to ceiling, so they were nearly two stories high. The room itself could easily fit two of my bedrooms in it, and my room was quite large. Making the room look even larger was a full wall of windows, although she kept the shades drawn most of the time, preferring the dim light of a bedside lamp.  
  
  To fill the space, she had several armoires, a writing desk, the largest bed I’d ever seen, and a sitting area complete with a couch, two chairs, and a coffee table. Today, she’d had a small dining table with two chairs set up near the window. It was all laid out with fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal – my favorite things.  
  
  The last few times I’d visited with her, Elora had been in bed, but she sat at the table today. Her long hair had once been jet black, but it was now silver-white. Her dark eyes were clouded with cataracts, and her porcelain skin had wrinkled. She was still elegant and beautiful, and I imagine she always would be, but she’d aged so much.  
  
  She was pouring herself tea when I came in, her silk dressing gown flowing behind her.",1,1758817362.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

A young woman, twenty-two, went missing from her apartment downtown. Pretty normal case on paper: no signs of forced entry, no broken windows, no screaming neighbors. The official report makes it sound like she just packed a bag and slipped away.

Except she didn’t.

When I got to her apartment, it felt wrong. Some places hum with absence, you know? Like they’re still echoing the last moments that happened there. Her bedroom was too neat, except for the wall.

Behind her bed, someone had cut a perfect square into the drywall. Too perfect to be accidental, too clinical to be angry. The insulation inside had been clawed apart, shredded like something had fought to get out—or in. Buried in the fluff, I found a strip of men’s pajama pants, blue and gray stripes, stained with something dark that wasn’t paint.

I bagged it. Logged it. Felt a little righteous, like the story was finally peeling open.

Two days later, when I checked the evidence room, the bag had disappeared. Clean. Like it never existed.

That’s when my lieutenant told me to “close the case.” He said it like a father telling his kid to stop asking why the dog went to the farm. Only his eyes said: drop it, or you’ll regret it.

Then a second missing person. Same neighborhood. Same age. Same file that screamed copy-paste.

I started noticing things no one else mentioned. Both apartments had cheap wall clocks in the living rooms—the kind you buy when you’re broke but want to pretend you’ve got your life together. And both clocks were broken, glass cracked, hands bent back like snapped fingers. Both frozen at 2:17.

That little detail gnawed at me. I didn’t tell anyone—not yet.

Instead, I followed up on the second girl’s apartment myself. The building smelled faintly of boiled cabbage and bad decisions, like most of the places I end up. Nothing unusual in the living room—except the clock. Frozen again, 2:17, like it was waiting for me.

When I leaned in to check it, the damn thing clicked. Just once.

I swear on my badge, the minute hand twitched forward, scraping across the broken glass. The sound was like a nail dragged across my teeth.

I left faster than I’d like to admit.

But here’s where things went from weird to dangerous.

A day later, I went back to re-check the first apartment. It was supposed to be empty—landlord had already re-listed it. But when I unlocked the door and stepped inside, I heard something. A sound that didn’t belong.

Someone breathing. Slow, steady, like they were trying not to be noticed.

My gun was in my hand before I knew it. I cleared the living room, the kitchen, the hall. Nothing. The bedroom, though… that’s where I froze.

The drywall square I’d found weeks before was bigger. Much bigger. The edges were raw, freshly cut, insulation spilling out like yellow guts.

And pressed into that insulation was a handprint. Small. Feminine. Fingertips bloody.

Then I heard movement—inside the wall. A shuffle, a drag, like knees and elbows scraping against wood.

I fired once into the drywall. The sound that came back wasn’t a scream. It was a laugh.

I don’t scare easy, but I left. I didn’t write it in my report. I didn’t tell my lieutenant. Because I already know how it’ll go: they’ll smile, nod, and quietly make me disappear too.

But I’ve been a cop too long to let a thing gnaw at me without biting back. I’ve walked enough alleys where the shadows smell like piss and rain, where the air carries a thousand whispered deals, to know silence is the weapon of men with power. Silence keeps graves shallow. Silence makes clocks stop at the same time in different rooms.

So I kept at it.

The girls all rented through the same shell company — no name on the paperwork but a P.O. box and an out-of-service number. Their landlords all swore they didn’t know shit about missing tenants, though their eyes said otherwise. One of them, a little bastard with nicotine-stained teeth, grinned when I pressed him. “Buildings settle,” he said. “People move. Time’s funny like that.”

Time. Always time.

It followed me. It whispered in corners. Clocks in pawn shops, flea markets, dumpsters. Cheap plastic faces cracked down the middle, hands wrenched back like broken fingers, all jammed at 2:17.

The city itself felt… wrong. Streets I’d walked for twenty years seemed off by a degree, like the horizon had tilted while I wasn’t looking. A church basement where I asked about a runaway reeked of mold and holy water, and nailed to a support beam was one of those clocks. Frozen, patient, its second hand twitching like a dying insect.

I started keeping copies of everything. Notes, photographs, lease records. My first piece of evidence — that strip of men’s pajama pants from the drywall — vanished from the evidence locker, but I kept my hands on the later finds. A Polaroid slid under my door one night: me, asleep in my bed, lamp burning, timestamped 2:47 a.m.

I live alone.

And the bastard who took the picture had stood at the foot of my bed to snap it.

I laughed when I saw it. Not because it was funny, but because sometimes you have to laugh at the hand pulling you into the grave.

But it wasn’t just pictures. The horror had teeth.

And then came the package.

A small box, left on my stoop before dawn. Inside: another strip of fabric, blood dried dark across it. And tucked beneath, a folded paper scrawled with block letters:

NOT MINE.

The handwriting was the same as the landlord’s, the one who told me “time’s funny.” Only this wasn’t a taunt. It looked like confession.

That night, I found fresh sawdust scattered across my living room floor. The bookshelf had been nudged an inch, and behind it a new hole gaped in the drywall — bigger than the last. I pulled the flashlight beam across it, and the light hit something pale, deep inside. A hand, small and feminine, pressed flat against the back of the cavity. Nails ragged, tips bloody.

It withdrew when my light touched it.

I’m not ashamed to say I stumbled back. Even men like me, who’ve waded through blood and smoke, feel the gravity of certain things. Some horrors demand respect.

Since then, my apartment hasn’t felt like mine. The air tastes of fiberglass and copper. At night, the pipes whisper, and the cat from next door sits outside my window, staring at the walls like it knows where the bodies are buried.

I followed the landlord one evening, out past the edge of town where the road forgets its name. He stopped at a storage unit and let himself in. When he left, I went inside.

I wish I hadn’t.

Stacked floor to ceiling were clocks, hundreds of them, all frozen at different times, all faces cracked like fractured skulls. And on wooden pallets, wrapped in tarps, were squares of drywall. Each labeled with a date and an address. Each bearing fingernail scratches in the insulation.

In the center of the room, laid out like an offering, was a sleeping bag. Torn open. Inside were scraps of fabric, the same blue-and-gray stripes I’d already seen, and a smell like mold and old blood. Beneath the shreds was another folded note:

WE TAKE WHAT WANTS OUT.

WE WAIT.

WE LISTEN FOR THE TICK.

WHEN IT STOPS, WE MAKE ROOM.

I left with that note burning a hole in my pocket.

Since then, the walls of my apartment have grown restless. I hear the slow crawl of knees and elbows. My kitchen clock died yesterday. Its hands are frozen at 2:17.

And last night, when I woke gasping in the dark, I found three crescent marks dug into the skin over my ribs. The shape of a grip. Too small to be mine.

I should’ve burned that note. Should’ve salted the storage unit and walked away. But walking away isn’t in my blood. Never has been.

I went back the next night. The place was empty, at least of people. But the clocks… Jesus. They’d shifted. All of them, thousands of little dead faces, were now fixed at the same time. 2:17. The tick-tick of a few still trying to breathe filled the room, like teeth chattering in the cold.

In the far corner, one pallet was uncovered. Fresh drywall, the cut square still damp at the edges. And leaning against it was a photograph pinned with a nail.

Me again. Only this time, not sleeping. This time, standing in that very unit, flashlight raised, mouth open like I’d just screamed.

I hadn’t taken the picture.

The drywall behind the photo flexed inward. A breath. A push. The sound of knuckles rapping from the inside, polite as a door-to-door salesman.

I ran. I don’t run often, not anymore, not with my knees the way they are. But I ran until my chest burned and the world blurred.

Now I sit at my desk, blinds drawn, typing this out. The walls here are too thin, too willing to bend when the night presses in. And I swear I hear that careful crawl again — knees and elbows dragging closer, the creak of studs straining.

Maybe they’ll take me tonight. Maybe the hole is already cut and I’m just waiting for the drywall to sigh open.

But I’m typing this out because someone needs to know. The girls didn’t vanish into thin air. They were taken into the walls, fed to something that moves like time and eats like silence.

And now it’s my turn.

If this account ends here — if the next thing you read is just empty space — understand this:

They don’t disappear. They get stored.

The clocks aren’t keeping time. They’re keeping count.

And when yours stops, the wall will already be waiting.

When the walls claim you, it won’t be quiet.

They will bend your air, drag your shadow through the floor,

and whisper in the spaces you thought were empty.

Time will not comfort you.

It will lean close, patient, and chew your life down to the bone,

until even the memory of your fear is too late to save you.

""I left my peaceful village to go to the city with the hope of changing my life. Or at least to find a job that could support myself and help my parents take care of my two siblings who are still in school. But that hope gradually faded, as it has been nearly a month since I came to the city. As a country boy with no degree or any connections or relatives here, of course, I couldn't get a decent job.

Until today, while sitting absentmindedly at a roadside cafe thinking about my murky future, a man approached me from out of nowhere. He looked at the portfolio in my hand and asked softly:

'Are you... looking for a job, young man?'

'Yes...' I answered listlessly with a face full of despair.

He looked at me for a few seconds and then asked:

'The security guard at my place just quit. Do you want to be a security guard?'

Like a drowning person grabbing a lifebuoy, I said excitedly:

'Yes... I do! Is your place nearby?'

'Just across the street! Want to go now?'

I nodded and hastily asked for the bill, then followed him into the small alley opposite. The alley was very narrow, just enough for a motorbike to pass through, and it was very deserted. I felt a pang of unease and urged:

'Are we there yet, sir?'

He stopped and said simply:

'We're here!'

'Here?' I was surprised.

In front of me was an old iron gate, with a surveillance camera mounted above. Behind the gate was a staircase with worn-out tiled steps. I took a few steps back and looked up. Under the scorching midday sun, many regularly spaced windows appeared before my eyes.

'This looks like an apartment building... and it seems to have been built a long time ago!' I thought to myself and asked the man:

'Are you the owner here, sir?'

'No, I'm just the manager!' he shook his head.

Seeing my hesitation, he asked:

'What do you think, young man?'

Honestly, I was a bit hesitant at that moment. The feeling here was very strange and unexplainable. But then I thought about the money in my pocket, which was almost gone. If I couldn't find a job today, I would surely have to pack up and go back home. 'I can't. What will I say to my family if I go back now? My parents borrowed money for me to come here to start a new life. How can I give up so easily!' I made up my mind, nodded, and said:

'When can I start working, sir?'

He said in a calm voice:

'Come here at 11 p.m. tonight, and I'll hand over the job!'

I nodded, thanked him, and left, my heart filled with joy that I had finally found a job to continue living in this bustling but also glamorous city. But I didn't know that it was just the beginning of a series of bizarre days that I would probably never forget for the rest of my life...

...

I stepped out of the house, looking as neat and presentable as possible for my first day of work. My heart was both happy and nervous, and I walked quickly on the street that was gradually becoming less crowded, with shops on both sides having almost closed down. Luckily, the alley where I worked was not far from my rented room, only about a 10-minute walk. Looking at my watch, it was only 10:30 p.m., so I stopped by a water stall that hadn't closed yet to buy a cup of coffee and then crossed the street to enter the same alley from the morning.

This alley was deserted during the day, but at night, it looked much scarier. It was very dark, with almost no streetlights except for a little light spilling from the nearby houses. I felt a little uneasy. Dark places like this are often where robberies happen, or at least where junkies and addicts hang out, asking for money. Thinking about having to walk through here every day, I suddenly felt discouraged.

'Did I... just see someone?'

At the corner of the alley, a young man was sitting silently in a dark corner, staring at me with cloudy, unblinking eyes. 'Oh, damn, why am I so unlucky!' I muttered to myself, sweating profusely at the sight of him. He was wearing a grayish-brown shirt and torn denim shorts, his body was skinny, and his face was gaunt as if he had been starved for a long time.

I walked away quickly. I kept glancing back behind me. Fortunately, he didn't follow. But I seemed to feel his eyes still watching my every move.

Sighing with relief, I finally arrived at my workplace. The iron gate was still closed, and the manager from the morning was nowhere to be seen.

'Sir... excuse me, I'm here to start work!'

I was flustered as I suddenly remembered that I didn't even know his name. How could I have been so careless! I waited for a moment, then called out again, but still, no one opened the door. It was almost 11 p.m., and my mind started to have thoughts like... maybe I was scammed? Who would hire an employee just by talking like this? And why would he scam a nobody like me, with only a few dollars in my pocket?

While I was feeling confused, a child's voice suddenly rang out right behind me:

'Who are you looking for, sir?'

I turned around, and it was a boy about 7 or 8 years old with big, black eyes. His whole body was covered in sweat and dirt, and he was holding a red leather ball. I asked him:

'I'm waiting for the manager here. Have you seen him, kid?'

The boy shook his head, then continued to run and play around in front.

'Why aren't you home sleeping at this hour? Where do you live?' I asked.

The boy stopped, panting, and replied:

'I'm waiting for my dad to come home. I live here!'

He pointed his hand at the iron gate behind me. So he was also a resident of this apartment building. Exactly at 11 p.m., the iron gate suddenly opened. Hearing its heavy creaking sound, I suddenly felt a shiver.

'Sorry to have kept you waiting, young man!'

Oh my god, so he was inside all this time. Why didn't he answer me earlier? Or maybe he didn't hear me calling? I forced a smile, even though I was a little annoyed:

'Yes... no problem, sir!'

'Come in!'

He gestured for me to go into the room right next to the stairs. I instinctively turned around to look at the boy, but he was no longer there. I thought his dad must have come to pick him up, so I didn't pay any more attention to it...

The manager introduced himself as Tan. The job was surprisingly simple. I just had to sit in one place and watch the cameras to monitor people coming and going. At 3 a.m., I had to take a walk around the building to check things, and then return to the camera room until the end of my shift. He then gave me two uniforms, a flashlight, a large bunch of building keys, a walkie-talkie, and said that the walkie-talkie was only for contacting him in an emergency, and it had no other function because I was the only security guard in the whole apartment complex.

After giving me the instructions, Tan asked:

'Do you have any other questions?'

'I just want to ask how many floors this apartment building has?'

'Only three floors. How does that sound?' Tan smiled.

'Piece of cake, sir!' I replied with a smile.

Tan said goodbye and left. He walked, so his house must be nearby. Left alone, I started to get used to the job by looking at each camera screen and memorizing its location. Fortunately, each screen had the floor number displayed on it and was arranged very logically, so it didn't take me long.

It's true that every job has its own difficulties. And the first difficulty of this job was... how to not fall asleep. Indeed, several hours had passed, but I didn't know what to do other than stare at the empty screens. Sooner or later, sleepiness began to creep in. Looking at my watch, it was almost 1 a.m. At this hour, there were probably no more people coming or going. I checked the door, then set an alarm for 3 a.m. just in case I fell asleep.

My eyelids were getting heavy, and the cup of coffee I bought earlier was all gone. I wearily rested my head on the table. The air conditioner continuously blew a cool breeze in the hot summer weather, making my body feel even more relaxed, and I fell asleep without even knowing it...

...

The echoing, creepy laughter of a child woke me up like a spring. For a second, my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest before I fumbled for my phone and turned it off.

'Oh my god, I forgot to change the ringtone...'

I mumbled to myself, then lazily got up and stretched my limbs. It was time to go check the building. A quick glance at the camera screens showed that everything seemed fine. I tucked the walkie-talkie into my belt and stepped out of the surveillance room.

My footsteps echoed throughout the apartment corridor. The hallway lights were almost all off. The clearest light came from the flashlight in my hand. Each floor had about 10 apartments, and the stairs were right next to the wall. This meant that after checking one floor, I had to go back to take the stairs to the next floor. It seemed a bit inconvenient, but I didn't mind much, I just considered it as checking twice in one trip.

The first and second floors were nothing strange, all the doors were closed. When I got to the third floor, it was a little different from the two floors below, this floor had 11 rooms. At the end of the hall, there was an iron sliding door, and behind it were stairs leading up, probably to the rooftop.

'Do I need to check the rooftop?'

I tried to use the keys, but none of them seemed to open the door. While I was fumbling, a whirring sound suddenly rang out right next to my ear. I was startled and turned to see an elevator going up right next to the iron door. Maybe it was too dark on this floor, so I didn't see it.

'Why didn't Tan tell me there was an elevator here?'

The elevator stopped right on the third floor. I don't know why I felt so nervous and anxious. Only a few seconds passed, but it felt so long, like I was watching a slow-motion movie. The door slowly opened...

There was no one inside. The elevator was pitch black, with only a strange greenish light coming from a small neon light attached above.

'Who would install a light of this color? Are they trying to scare people?' I grimaced.

In the right corner, there was a small camera mounted next to the light bulb. I tried to rack my brain, but I couldn't remember if any screen in the surveillance room was connected to this camera.

A cold gust of wind suddenly blew past me, giving me goosebumps. The elevator door slowly closed, and then it stopped completely. Everything became quiet again as if nothing had happened.

I hurriedly picked up the walkie-talkie to call Tan, but then I remembered that he was probably asleep at this hour. Not wanting to disturb his sleep, I decided to wait until tomorrow to ask him.

Walking down the stairs, the surveillance room was only a few steps away when from behind, a red leather ball rolled down, making heavy thudding sounds. It was the ball of the little boy from earlier. Was he still awake at this hour?

I looked up but only saw the deep blackness of the darkness. Picking up the ball, I thought for a moment, then took it into the room and put it in a corner, planning to find the boy in the morning to return it...

...

It was 3:30 a.m., which meant I had spent about half an hour on this patrol. It was quite fast, I guess. I plopped down on the chair, leaned back, my eyes dull and bloodshot from sleepiness. I suddenly remembered the camera in the elevator, so I checked all the screens in front of me again. There really was no screen connected to that camera. Maybe... it was broken?

Bored with thinking, I just gave up on everything because my eyes were getting stuck together. I set the alarm for 5 a.m., rested my head on the table, and planned to get a little more sleep to clear my head. But after only about 5 minutes of dozing off, I was startled awake by the cold. I fumbled around to find the remote to turn off the air conditioner, with my eyes barely open.

'That's strange, I can't find the remote?'

I searched every corner of the room but still couldn't find it. I wearily looked up at the air conditioner to see if there was a switch or something to turn it off. But... I discovered something incredibly terrifying about this room that I hadn't realized until now. This room... didn't have an air conditioner.""

Was blocking him the only option?,"This friend of some friends (m22) that I met almost six months ago, lied to me big time, we started as friends I think he realized I found him attractive so we started a sexual relationship, without my knowledge he didn’t use protection until I noticed, so he said that it was fine that he didn’t see anyone else. Once he said we could go get coffee, I had to go get him at his house cause he didn’t have a car, when I arrived he asked me to come inside and basically persuaded me to have sex, started touching me but I didn’t want to, I had gotten so pretty that day, he finished and I went to the bathroom, I thought well once it’s fine whatever at least it’s over, but when I got out he grabbed me again and did it again. I didn’t feel in danger, he’s not very strong but I was scared he’d stop liking me or smt like that, apparently his mom was home but it’s not like I can just do running to her.
We saw each other a couple of times more, he was trying idk if to love bomb me but called me beautiful and sweetie, I told him that if he didn’t want anything serious it was fine but treating me like a gf wasn’t nice. 
After that he kinda distanced himself a bit, never made plans to see each other, he canceled on me the last minute so I went and saw another “friend” of mine, with full protection.
Some days after our mutual friend tells me he’s also seeing his cousin, and a day after confirms he did the same thing, he didn’t tell her he didn’t wear protection, so I confront him about it he pretends he doesn’t know what I’m talking about but comes clean afterwards and I tell him I also saw someone but with protection, I forgive him.
Days go by, still no plans, no hangouts, and after beating around the bush with some texts, I ask him plain and simple did you chose her?  And he said yes, but we continued to be friends for a couple of weeks more.
Yesterday idk why I had enough and felt good just plain and simple blocking him, we talked every single day but I always had everything in the back of my mind. Today he confronted me about it and even though I feel justified in doing so maybe there was another way to do so? But I can’t think of any other way, was there smt else to do?

Almost every one of these appliances has issues of one sort or another.  

Starting with the range, 2 of the 6 gas burners shoot out long fingerlike flames rather than a nice ring of fire like you'd expect.  3 of the six won't light automatically with the built in igniter so I have to use a lighter.  On the 2 ovens in that range, they use a touchscreen apparently borrowed from the 1980s that refuses human input 90% of the time.  So far the griddle is the only thing that works as expected on the range.  

Moving on to the dishwasher, it has so far worked ok, but it's infuriating to use on a daily basis.  Why?  Because someone at Miele thought it would be cute to have the display show the Miele logo for 20 seconds or so when you turn on the appliance, during which time you cannot do anything other than stare at the logo.  About every 10th time it doesn't show the logo and you can just select the mode and start the dishwasher.  The rest of the time, you have to sit and wait for it to go away.  And all this while already having a permanently embossed logo stamped into the stainless steel 4 inches away on the same panel.

On the refrigerator, the biggest issue is the plastic clips that are used on the drawers.  They fall out constantly making the drawer unusable until you empty it out, take it all apart, retrieve the fallen clip and reassemble it so you can open and close the drawer normally.

The freezer is ok except for the ice maker, which is poorly designed and placed making it not only a pain to access the ice, but also making half the ice in the bin useless.  We use it every day yet in just a 2 or 3 days time, all the ice in the bottom is fused together in what looks like snow cone ice.  

The coffee machine makes good coffee, but it is constantly calling for me to empty the drip tray or the waste bin, even though they are already empty.  I sometimes have to remove and reinsert either one 3 or 4 times to get the machine to allow me to continue to make a cup of coffee.  

The microwave with its knobs rather than a typical set of soft buttons feels like something from the 70s, but otherwise works ok.  

Overall, everything is poorly engineered and cheaply made, which is pretty shocking from the Germans.  I have posted this elsewhere today as well because I have finally had enough!  It makes me really angry considering the reputation this company has and the amount of money spent on all this junk.
