1j3yaqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TinnitusTalk/comments/1j3yaqo/vent_please_talk_to_me/,(vent) please talk to me,"hi everyone. i've had tinnitus for maybe 5 or 6 years, i just remember sitting at the school library getting this intense ringing that then got less intense but was always there since. it was super quiet and not a crazy high pitched sound, so i got used to it fast. since then ive had tiny spikes where it would ring hard again for a few seconds then go back to normal. that's how i remember it at least, now i'm questioning everything and whether i ever actually had tinnitus since what i'm going through right now is so, so unbearable. i will mention i think i was on antidepressants back then, think it was sertraline, ive done fluoxetine later and the ringing wasn't really impacted, idk if it ever started because of meds or because i had a mild ear infection or something. i was on fluoxetine until february or march last year when i quit because i was scared i would get liver damage since i was drinking at the time - not doing that anymore either.

this december 3 months ago, i was in a really bad mental condition and my psychiatrist prescribed me wellbutrin. i mentioned to her i was on sertraline and fluoxetine before and they were nice but kind of just made me drowsy and emotionless i suppose, i also have adhd and she said wellbutrin could help with that. i took it for around 2 weeks, a bit less i believe, maybe 11 days. i was genuinely losing my mind on it, just irritable 24/7, snapping at everybody, i couldn't control myself. on new years, i had like a glass of wine with it, and had a terrible terrible panic attack. i consulted my psychiatrist saying i can not be on this medication anymore since it's driving me insane, she told me to stop taking it (i was on the lowest dose btw).

after new years i came back to my uni accomodation, and i started hearing this electrical buzzing noise up from the ceiling. i was so sure it was just something faulty in my room, it was annoying but i spent a lot of my time wearing headphones and it was more or less fine. i believe i heard it from time to time only, not constantly, but it's possible it was constant and very mild, i can't be sure anymore. i remember walking around my room and it seemed louder in one spot, so i figured it was something in the wires. i was so, so wrong.

i spent like 2 months like that. then 2 weeks ago i went back home. the first night at home, and then 2 nights i spent at my friends place, i genuinely don't think i heard any electrical noise - maybe it wasn't quiet enough in those rooms for me to hear it, even though i believe there was almost complete silence, i remember sleeping fine, not worrying. i was still in a bad place mentally though. i went to my psychiatrist again. i told her i wasn't sure what caused me to act up so bad on wellbutrin, that maybe it was the dopamine part. she made me go on cymbalta.

day 1 was okay. i felt hopeful actually, i was very jittery again like on wellbutrin, but i thought i could handle it. i take methylphenidate for my adhd sometimes and the way it works is i get more jittery physically but more calm and task oriented mentally. i thought it was an okay trade off. she also told me i could take them together. so, day 2, i did. shortly after, i heard what i believe is a new tone in my left ear. louder, more high pitched than before. and my right ear, the electrical buzzing sound. i heard that now, in my actual room at home. the sound i was so sure was just some faulty wiring at my uni accomodation.

i had the worst panic attack ever. i lost my shit, it was so bad. but after that i went on with my day still, the adhd stimulants probably helped with that. my stomach hurt really bad, i was on the verge of throwing up - i believe just from severe anxiety. i took one more dose that evening. at night i couldn't sleep, my ears were so loud, and in the morning i cried and called my psychiatrist. she told me to get off the meds (i was also on the lowest dose - 30mg i believe). i started researching everything like crazy, finding out both wellbutrin and cymbalta cause this shit, and its usually permanent. i couldn't eat for 3 days, i just kept throwing up from anxiety. i couldn't sleep. it's been 10 days since i quit the meds, the tinnitus is just as bad. i knew it would be permanent and no one believed me. now they're starting to believe, but nobody understands how unbearable the sound is. i've been drinking so much herbal tea to just calm down. i skipped uni for a week because i just stayed in bed all day, listening to the sound, crying, throwing up. but i can't drop out.

yesterday i came back to my uni accomodation and burst into tears right upon getting in my room. the electrical sounds are so, so intense here. i open the window a lot since the traffic is nice and loud. there is also a bathroom fan noise a lot of the time, and my laptop makes white noise if i leave it on with a game playing. i don't know how i dealt with this for 2 months, i believe it was either very mild, or it just came and went. but now it's constant, and its so bad, i hear it with my headphones on, and i can't focus on anything. the ringing tone in my left ear is nothing compared to this shit. i'm somehow managing to sleep better than last week, my bed is more comfortable here too, but i keep waking up at night with panic attacks, and in the morning my anxiety is worse than ever. knowing it's there, knowing it's not going away. i will hear it forever.

i thought i could habituate, deal with this somehow, since i dealt with my tinnitus before. but it was so mild, i genuinely don't even know if i can say i had it before, it feels so stupid. and i can't habituate to this sound, i can't possibly do that, it's so unpredictable, it puts me on edge right away.

i know im supposed to distract myself, but i can't not listen to the sound. i can't have something playing 24/7, and even if i do, i know the tinnitus is there, i know i fucked up my life and i can't forgive myself. maybe if i had realized after the wellbutrin at least, maybe if i hadn't taken cymbalta, i could have somehow managed this. but i didn't know, i truly didn't know. i can't stop blaming myself. i can't stop blaming my psychiatrist too, and i can't stop blaming the world - because why did this have to happen to me? none of my friends have to deal with this shit, its all so isolating. i was starting to get my life together. i had small stuff that made me happy, having coffee in the morning, talking to my friends. some hope for the future. now everything is just hopeless. i signed up for therapy, i have my first session today. i keep thinking i should've done therapy months ago, instead of going on meds. but i didn't know. and i was on meds for so long before, i thought it would help, i thought things would be okay.

this is just a nightmare come true. i've never felt this suicidal. i've never felt this isolated. nobody understands. people tell me to just keep myself busy and play some music over this, but i don't see the point of anything, of living, if this is what it'll look like. i can't forgive myself. i can't move on. i spent the past 2 weeks wishing i had never taken cymbalta. wellbutrin too, though i had no idea that was my tinnitus even. i don't know what to do. everything feels so hopeless. i had some plans and dreams for the future, now i know i can't do any of it, i can't do anything. i love having stuff playing in the background, i love music, i love games, tv shows. but i also love silence. now i can't love anything anymore. even if i put on a show, or music, i hyperfixate on my tinnitus so bad, i can hear it over things. honestly, the left ear ringing is so much louder than it was too. i don't even know which is worse. but the ringing i could at least maybe get used to. it's all going to drive me into psychosis. i will keep distracting myself, but i don't know how long i can go on like this. my life feels over. all because of one mistake. i will never forgive myself. i just want to turn back time, i want my life back to when i thought it was bad but i didn't have to worry about this. i never thought it could be as bad as it is right now.

this post is super long and i apologize. i've been scrolling this subreddit for the past week. i've read posts from people in situations similiar to mine. tinnitus induced by fucking antidepressants, which made me more depressed. i can't see a way out of this. i know the only way out is through. i know i can't do much. but i can't accept this, i just can't. this whole situation. i want my old life back. i want my happiness back. why did this have to happen to me, why is the world so unfair? i always protected my hearing, i don't listen to music loud, i don't go to loud places but this still happens to me of all people. none of my friends have this problem, nobody understands how unbearable it is. i don't want to live in this world. i don't think i can ever habituate to this.",1,1741162267.0,TinnitusTalk,0,1.0,False

1j3yai6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1j3yai6/flea_infestation_in_carpeted_apartment/,Flea infestation in carpeted apartment,"I have a flea infestation in my 1 bedroom 600 something sq feet apartment. This entire apartment is carpeted except for the bathroom and kitchen areas (both of which combined roughly match the size of a king bed.) 

We sprinkled DE powder all over the carpets, let it sit for 24hours, vacuumed, and went over with a handheld carpet shampooer (to the best of our ability) and also for a final F U to the fleas I made sure when I sprayed febreze to aim it directly on the carpet. Because we happen to be moving soon and will be getting rid of a lot of furniture anyways, we did that this weekend. In the apartment we have 2 desks, 2 office chairs, a bed, and a coffee table as far as furniture left - so hopefully there is less spaces for them to nest. 

Im looking for suggestions. Is there anything I should do that I haven’t done yet? I’ve never dealt with carpet until moving out a few years ago so anything helps. TIA!

how come most machines use boilers and not thermoblocks?

seems to me like the procumer machine market can only benefit form the minimum wait time for the first shot. companies like ascaso and zuriga use them with success and it seems to have the edge over boilers in many aspects (when done properly).

i know many coffee appliances (appliances not machines) use them and maybe caused 'damage' to the tech as its used in a very low end way (thats what I have heard).

B is a man who listens just as much as he speaks, who values meaningful conversations over small talk, and who finds joy in the little things—like a quiet morning with coffee or a handwritten note. He’s steady, kind, and deeply thoughtful, always considering how his actions affect those around him. He believes in love that’s built on trust, laughter, and shared dreams. Whether it’s planning an adventure or simply sitting in comfortable silence, he knows that the best moments are the ones that feel effortless.

""I thought I was calling the wife of Jackson Chester who was admitted here early this morning."" the hospital worker on the other end of the line said carefully, with thickly accented English.
""That. Yes, that is my husband, is he OK, what is wrong?""
""But I am so sorry, the mistake must be mine,"" she said again.
""No!"" I repeated. ""I am Alice Chester, Jackson's wife. He flew to Portugal several days ago for work, you have not made a mistake, I am his wife. I need to know what happened, please, can I speak to a doctor?""

____________

""Yes, I, I am so sorry if I called the wrong number,"" the hospital worker on the other end of the line said carefully, with thickly accented English. ""I thought I was calling the wife of Jackson Chester who was admitted here early this morning.""
""That. Yes, that is my husband, is he OK, what is wrong?"" Alice blurts out, frustrated by over an hour of being passed from person to person at the hospital overseas that had left her a message about her husband.
""But I am so sorry, the mistake must be mine,"" she said again.
""No!"" I repeated. ""I am Alice Chester, Jackson's wife. He flew to Portugal several days ago for work, you have not made a mistake, I am his wife. I need to know what happened, please, can I speak to a doctor?""
""But. But."" The woman was clearly floundering, and Alice was growing increasingly desperate.
""His wife arrived about thirty minutes ago,"" she whispered cautiously.
""Well now THAT is impossible, because I am right here, on US soil, in the state of Wisconsin!!"" Alice carefully enunciated into the phone. ""I am his wife. I am his emergency contact. And you will get me his doctor. NOW."" Silence greets the command, but she doesn't hang up.
What is happening to my life? Alice wonders while listening to hold music that abruptly started. Putting the phone on speaker she opens her text messages and sends a simple SOS to her best friend. ""Get here now, I need you, something's happened and I don't know what to do!"" She could count on Shelly to come running.
""Mrs. Chester?"" the woman speaks again. ""The doctor says he. Well, the doctor thinks he already spoke to you. In person."" She hesitates and then blurts out, ""He had a small blood clot in his lung and passed out, he fell down some stairs and most of his injuries actually seem to be from that – he broke several bones and has a concussion.""
Alice took a deep breath, ""Is he going to be OK?""
""Yes, I think it sounds like he will recover,"" the woman said.
""Please don't tell anyone you told me all this,"" Alice whispered.
""Oh, right, of course not, thank you – that, that's better for me too, I probably shouldn't have told you so much, but I believe you,"" she replied. ""I wish I could help more.""
""That's ok, thank you, you did more than enough,"" Alice finished and hung up.
Not the way she thought Tuesday would go.

Alice paused to review her prep list, she had methodically worked her way through most of her annual back-to-school tasks. The high school library and media center was her pride and joy – a place of learning and hard work, but also a busy center of teenage creativity and occasional angst. When the strict school day structure drained her, the after-school clubs and drop ins recharged her batteries.
Each year brought a new group of nine graders eager to make their mark and terrified of new pressures and workload. Her library often became a refuge for those looking for encouragement and motivation, as well as the juniors and seniors panicked about college applications and AP exams. Alice leaned back in her new desk chair – a gift not from the tight school budget from her husband whose software business had taken off last year and who had insisted on providing some improvements for her day job where she spends so much of her. In reality she rarely sits for more than a few minutes at a time, her job revolves more around interaction with students and her colleagues, but the gesture was kind.
Chewing on the end of her pen Alice put her list down and decided she was done for the day. She was well on her way to be fully ready for school opening the following Monday. She felt unsettled, mostly prepared but also a bit adrift as if she was forgetting something. Was it something at home, not her well organized school task list? She had her grocery list in her phone, she hadn't misplaced her staff card to get in and out of the building, she hadn't left the stove on at home... Alice took a deep breath and laughed softly at herself. She was as ADHD as many of the students who would drop in right before midterms sheepishly asking for help on a research assignment they had procrastinated on or desperate for tips on how to manage the chaotic expectations of six different class loads.
Alice had a practiced and extremely effective system of self-organization that she had developed out of necessity back in college after her boyfriend had gently but firmly forced her to see a doctor to ask about an ADHD diagnosis. She probably would have failed out without him, and the realization that she needed to take steps to figure out how to manage her life before her dreams of a college degree slipped away. Jackson had been right, as usual, and the diagnosis was the most freeing and empowering thing that had ever happened to her once she started reading about AHD and taking steps, one by one, to organize her personal and academic life. By her senior year she was one of the most organized students her advisor had ever seen, bordering on obsessive with her lists, dedicated selfcare time, and support system.
Graduation was an emotional affair. She used her part-time job money to bring her parents to the celebration, getting them a hotel room, taking them out to dinner with Jackson's family, and announcing that she had a job offer as a high school librarian in Jackson's hometown, back in Franklin, Wisconsin. She had secretly applied and hoped he would be thrilled to have a reason to move home, closer to his parents who had treated her like a daughter since they met.
Jackson had stunned her with his enthusiasm, and at the end of dinner surprised her with a teary proposal in front of their parents, promising that they'd wait a few years to get married after their careers were solid and they could afford what they wanted to do. He knew she wouldn't want his parents to pay for it all and that she would want to focus on paying off her student loans.
He also boasted an announcement of his own, that he and his college buddy Eduardo were going to try to start a software company. They were both going to pursue business degrees, Eduardo returning to Portugal and Jackson there at Cresent College. He could commute from Franklin the day he had in person class. It would be perfect, he said.
Shaking herself, Alice stood up abruptly and shut down her computer. Jackson was in Portugal with Eduardo that week, managing business deals that had to be done in person, so she needed to refocus on groceries and a quiet evening at home. Hopefully, Jackson would have time to call her before she fell asleep – the time difference was always an obstacle when he travelled to Europe, but they were used to it by now.

""Ms. C! Ms. C!"" the jostling teenagers in front of her called out as she pushed her cart through the frozen foods aisle.
""Wow,"" Alice asked, looking at the stack of boxes carried by each of the four boys and then peering into the wall of glass-doored freezers where there were now three empty shelves. ""Why do you need ALL the popsicles?""
""Uh, yeah, we're holding a car wash tomorrow morning in the school parking lot, the robotics club needs all the help it can get this year, so we're starting early, fundraising now before we are drowning in homework,"" said Dean, a lanky and bespeckled redhead who Alice knew well.
""Then I'll have to make sure to drive through some mud on my way in tomorrow,"" Alice chuckled. ""Smart thinking to get ahead guys."" She gave them a small salute and continued on toward the ice cream end of the aisle. She was on a mission for comfort food to enjoy while Jackson was out of town. When he was home, he would consume her pints of Ben and Jerry's before she could blink.
Before finishing up she grabbed her phone and called Jackson's mother. ""Rosalind, hi! I'm just at the store, do you need me to grab anything for you and Jerry?""
""Thanks, my dear, but we are all good – you stocked us up for weeks with that last delivery,"" Jackson's mother replied in her jolly tone. Rosalind was a spitfire little lady, retired but in charge of half the volunteer committees in town despite needing more time to take care of her husband recently. Jerry had been diagnosed with Parkinson's just over a year ago, and they were all still trying to adjust.
""OK, tell Jerry hello and I'll see you Friday for dinner when Jackson's back – we'll come to you, but I'm cooking!"" Alice reminded her. The Friday before school started dinner bash was an annual tradition, a last hurrah of the summer before Alice dove into the chaos of the year.
Paying at the self-checkout and making her way to her car she dumped her bags in the trunk and jumped in, eager to get home. Back at the house she whipped up her favorite pasta and settled in to continue her TV binge of ""shows Jackson can't stand."" His monthly work trips gave her time she honestly needed to quiet her mind and just be.
The next day she was up at dawn, making a giant pot of coffee and settling in at her home office desk. The schedule she kept to stay on top of everything dictated that Tuesdays were for bills, the home chore list, and writing. Coffee number one went down while she reviewed her list. Coffee number two after the sheets were in the wash and the house vacuumed. She ran through quickly through the bank account transactions, credit card statement, and her cooking plan for the next two weeks. Her obsessive organization had naturally put her in charge of all the household management and Jackson left her to it, trusting her with everything.
She poured coffee number three and settled in to write. This is what she really did while Jackson was away. The one thing she hid truly for herself, but that she was going to have to tell Jackson about soon. She was both nervous and excited, hoping he would be so proud of her for her recent success that he would forgive the hurt of hiding this effort from him.
She had finished her first young adult fantasy novel in the spring and had started trying to get it published. It had finally been accepted, and she was working her way through the very final editing process. The timing was perfect, she should be done this week before school started. It would be released in January, and she was terrified, in the best way possible. She loved her job and her students, but this was like launching a part of herself out into the world. She basked in her inner glow – she'd never been so proud of herself, and she was so sure that this would be the start of something new and wonderful for them.
Her phone interrupted her, and she frowned at what looked like an international area code. Jackson wouldn't be calling her from an unknown number, so she ignored it, assuming it was a scam call. But when a voicemail alert flashed at her a minute later, she paused, a growing feeling of dread slowly creeped its way from her chest to the bottom of her stomach that made her hesitate before she pressed play.
Alice frowned at her wine glass. It was empty. Again. She contemplated the perfect circular rim, running her finger round and round, round and round, not bothering to refill the glass.
Pounding on her door interrupted her silence and she yelled, ""It's open Shelly!""
Shelly bustled in but hesitated before sitting on the couch, slowly observing the midday display of open wine bottle, half-eaten melted ice cream, and empty bag of chocolate covered pretzels, the top three on the list of her best friend's comfort food that was usually consumed in moderation in line with Alice's typically controlled fashion.
""OK, what is going on?"" Shelly breathed out softly as she sat down and turned to face Alice. ""You're not crying,"" she said suspiciously, ""but clearly something has happened.""
Alice laughed, harsher than her normal easy-going chuckle. ""Yeah, I'm not crying. I guess I'm in shock. Should I be crying?"" she asked her empty wine glass, not Shelly.
Turning back to face her friend Alice sucked in a huge breath and let it out again. ""Do you want the short version or the long version?""
""Just let it out,"" Shelly replied softly.
Alice could not face her friend and turned to look out the window. ""Jackson landed in the hospital in Portugal. They called me, his emergency contact. I didn't answer because I thought it a scam call. When I heard the voicemail and called back, I had to work my way through people to get to the right department and prove I was who I said I was before I could get any information. Apparently... his wife had shown up at the hospital already so the administration office didn't understand how... his wife... could be calling form the United States."" Alice finally looked back at Shelly. ""Don't waste my wine!""
Shelly abruptly stopped pouring into her glass which was full to the brim. She had frozen in shock, her mouth slightly open and her eyes wide. ""Wait. WHAT?!"" she spluttered.
Alice laughed bitterly again. ""Yep, I got accused of trying to commit fraud or something, get information about a patient I had no connection to. When I finally got through to the person who had contacted me in the first place the poor woman was beside herself. She was terribly afraid she had made a mistake, and English of course wasn't her first language, so I had to talk her down before I could get any details. I asked if he had given any instructions to not inform his wife of his medical information and she said no, so I was able to get the doctor on the phone. Apparently, he had a blood clot in his lung. The timing was terrible and when he wasn't feeling well and called emergency services, he fell down some stairs, broke two ribs and hit his head. He was unconscious for a while. The hospital called his emergency contact in his phone once he was stabilized because no one was with him.""
Alice stopped talking. Retelling it, now she felt like crying. ""Then he woke up and I guess called... his woman... because while I was on the phone working my way through the stupid hospital bureaucracy she had arrived at the ER and joined him. I asked the poor woman and the doctor not to say they'd talked to me, to just not bring it up.""
Looking in her friend's eyes she finally let her tears fall. ""He woke up hours ago Shelly. And he hasn't texted me or called me. He hasn't reached out to ME at all. But that woman is there, with him. Saying she is his WIFE!"" Her voice cracked.
Sobbing now, Alice choked out, ""I don't understand what is going on. I had no idea anything was wrong! What am I supposed to do now?""",1,1741160714.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I’ve been diagnosed with adhd over a year now. Been taking adderal. Recently my doctor changed  it to XR couples months ago and I was doing well. But this Ramadan has been so hard to just focus with work/house chores/ cooking. I’m not sure if I’m just really stressed or what. I live with my in-laws and my in laws are in saudi and we’re supposed to come back today. But they extended it for another 10 days. Which makes me have more responsibilities with cooking, taking care of the house. I know I’m a grown adult that should already know how to do this. I do know how to do these things but this is my first Ramadan with my in laws and it’s sooo LONELY and I miss my family. My FIL didn’t go to Saudi, so I have to make sure he eats, and takes care of himself since he’s an elder and has health issues. I work from home, and my husband goes to the office, 5 days a week. Weekends are so lovely but when it comes to weekdays I just cannot seem to manage everything, and I just try to do my best but it’s just the house work is never ending!! My husband does help, but I feel bad because he’s comes home tired. Work is demanding, and I am trying my best to pray and ready Quran…but like it makes me so sad I can’t do as much as I used to during Ramadan esp with the medications I’m taking and after getting married. I’m so tired, I just want to sleep peacefully sometimes. And now it’s 1:30 am and I cannot sleep, and I think it’s because of the adhd medication/caffeine and my sleep schedule but anyone got any advice on how to set a schedule during ramandan to get enough sleep and to stop stressing.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.",4,1741160278.0,HighStrangeness,1,1.0,False

To go do something. She said it wouldn't hurt to see what's ""out there"" and give them a fair shot. She said if someone catches my eye and I want to spend time with them, then I should do it. So instead of spitefully swiping left on every man that appeared before me, I started reading their bios. I looked at all of their photos. I swiped right on about dozen profiles, and I got a dozen instant matches. That always creeps me out a little bit. I understand it's a good thing and I should be flattered, but something about it gives me the ick. They're perceiving me, these strangers are judging me. And worst of all, they're liking what they see. But, I decided to reply to some of the messages I received. I need to examine why I'm like this... Because the more enthusiastic these men seem to be for me, the more I'm inclined to ignore them. I wonder if that's a relic from my previous relationship. Is it a defense mechanism against potential lovebombing, or am I subconsciously preferring unavailable men (like him)? Well, either way... 

I went on a date. Met up in the early afternoon. We got coffee and chatted for a while. Then we walked to the book store and chatted a whole bunch. After that, we went to a food court, and again just chatted for so long. This boy can yap. And listen. We drove separately to a bar to shoot pool. We were both so terrible. It took hours to complete 2 games... I don't even remember who won either time. He said I was adorable. I caught him looking at me a lot, just smiling softly as I biffed so many shots. Believe it or not, we'd not run out of things to yap about yet. So we went and sat in his car, took turns playing our favorite songs, and just talked. It was actually the second longest 1st date I've ever had. From 3pm until after midnight. Crazy! 

I like him. We have so much in common, it's actually insane. I never really know where things will go when I meet new people, though. My heart can be so fickle. He said he's the same as me. I'm attracted to him esthetically, which is about as good as it gets for a first date for someone like me (and him). We will see what becomes of this new connection. But regardless, I'm happy. I had a good day. I've agreed to dinner with another fella later in the week. It's a little overwhelming. I hate talking to more than one person at a time. How in the hell do cheaters manage this???

last week after church (where i met her, whtie lie told her i am down with christ when at best i am adjacent to christ, tryin hard to believe but cant convince myself) she came back 2 my place for coffee. this was a big commitment 4 me because usually after church they have like a social get together type thing in the basement that is mostly attended by elderly n busy bodies n this is where i get most of my nourishment for the week. they have mostly muffins and christsoints (thats what i call them since they come fro church) and i usually act like i am comin back for another servin then i put it in my bag. i dont feel bad because i know for a fact that they just trhow like half of it out. i dont take the juice boxes because that would be like legit stealing and given im on church the odds of the big guy watchin me r higher than if i ask for water at subway and take pepsi max. (I dont do that but it has crossed my mind). but i had 2 skip this to hang out with her.

nto sure if u know this but most of my life centers around findin ways to sustain my nourishment. last few years our food banks got hit hard af by itnernational students so its not what it used 2 be. plus i lost my job recently so ic ant rely on my employee meal. i was hopin doug ford woruld change things 4 me but they r all the same. ford troughdough. the only one who seems legit is that french guy who wants to stop the dairy mafia but everybody thinks he is racist 4 some reason so i cant tell ppl i voted 4 him strictly 4 the price of milk 2 come down. (I dont think he is racist or at least i hope not)

i digress.

so i take her back to my place. super clean. ive got my crate n barrel furniture up. exotic cheeses put otu there. my semi erotic black n white art of men. well it wasnt actually my place. my fav uncle bruce is out of town so i have 2 go to his place once a week so he can tell his insurance company that someone went there 2 make sure it wasnt flooded. (it wasnt flooded) and so i figured with how inested he is in me ""doing something with my life"" he wouldnt mind me bringing a girl there. it wasnt for anything sexual. i just wanted her to be impressed with my upscale furniture n expensive looking erotic statue collection. i told her it was my place but that i bought it furnished and i have more than one opalce so i never changed it. i think it was a good cover.

everything went 11/10. now she wants to hang out again next week 4 one of our ""exotic cheese chills"" as we call them but the problem is that bruce is back in town. he is super supportive of my heterosexual lifestyle and would let me bring her over but the point is i cant tell her its not my place. especially since bruces partner cassius might be around and when she saw all the pictures of him i told her he was my ex-partner in iraq and he died in my arms after he stepped on an iud. i dont want her to think he is a ghost n have her belief in christ shaken or worse believe that i lied about bein on the frontlines of operation desert freedom. (it was a white lie because sometimes i say inappropriate things so i covered by tellin her its a symptom of my time in war)

so the big thing is i do have my own place but its not as bergroy as bruces. its a bachelor apartment that i havent got around to furinishin much. i got all the basic modern stuff u need like an xbox 360 and cushions for the floor, but i dont have rich people stuff like couches, mattresses, decorative throws, food, etc.

i know that most guys understand my setup and are usually kind of jealous of it, but im afraid hse wont udnerstand. i was thinking i could tell her i own the building but my landlord is a philapeno man and i dont look philapeno so i dont think i could pull it off.

aret there any cheap and easy ways to make a completely unfurnished apartment comfortable for women. i dont want her to find out that i dont actually own 7 properties. i was thinkin of trying to spin it as some sort of mammalist lifestyle like all the trendy youtubers were doin a few years back, but i dont know i that would fly because she already saw bruces place (which she thinks is my place) and there is nothin minimalist about a 50 inch painting in your hallway of some naked greek man",0,1741159926.0,interiordecorating,1,0.25,False

first of all i would like apologize for my grammar mistakes, english isn't my first language. I will try my best to explain so please bear with me. It might get very long, so i m sorry in advance.  
for the context of the story i will name myself Bella and my Ex bestie Milly.  
I (26F) met Milly when i was on 12th standard through a mutual friend outside of my college. Milly was very out-spoken, would curse very often, very straight forward kind of girl. she was from India and i m from Nepal. She was a very rebellious kind of a girl coming from a very conservative Indian family.  
Milly at that time had a boyfriend whom let's call RV, wasn't liked by milly's family. they hate him because he belonged from another caste\\ethnic group. Most Nepalese and Indians still have issues regarding getting married to different caste. the most important part of the story is ""i was her only best friend up until than.""

So, story begins back at 2021, when we were still over coming covid. It was early september.  
i got strange message from milly via messenger in the afternoon. she was strangely asking me questions about cause for missing period over and over again. i explained her its quite normal to miss period for months due to stress and hormonal imbalance but she wasn't satisfied with my answer. she bugged me for whole afternoon stressing about her period being late and suddenly it clicked me. i asked her "" did you get intimate with your boyfriend recently?"" she was hesitant at first and yet again i explained risk revolving around pregnancy being delayed for abortions. she said ""No, she didn't.""  
i was busy with my house chores after that. late at night i again text from milly and she has something to confess me. low and behold ""Milly was pregnant"" and that stupid girl didn't knew when she got her last period. i was totally shocked thinking about the consequences and cherry on top, her at the time boyfriend was in jail for fraud case. it was too much for me to process as i was her only hope for pulling her out of this mess ALONE and her boyfriend being in jail, unreachable, unaware about the fact his girl being pregnant. i calmed myself and forced milly to remember her last period. she gave a supposedly date for her last period & supposedly date of being intimate. According to my calculation, she was 3 and half months pregnant. Yet, we didn't knew for sure if she was really pregnant because she hadn't took a pregnancy test. so, we were just assuming. The very next day we went to the pharmacy to buy a pregnancy kit and i had to pretend as if i was married women just to get that damn pregnancy kit because in Nepal unmarried pregnant girls aren't openly accepted. Its a taboo.  
later on we went to my home, i have asked milly to save the sample of morning urine for the test. we bought 3 test and all of them were fucking positive dark red lines. it was my first time trying pregnancy kit and it was absolute pure horror to find my bestie unmarried pregnant in the absence of her baby daddy. its also a reminder to all girls out there not to rely on pull out method. we went to the hospital . did all the scanning and found out she was 4 months pregnant. Milly's mother was already very doubtful of her daughter not getting her period so she was planning to take her to the hospital for checkup. knowing the results it was impossible to let her go to the hospital. Her family would die out of shame. all pressure was on my shoulder at that point. i googled how to make a fake blood in order for milly to fake having periods by staining her pads and toilet for her mother to believe her daughter got her period and it worked. i was with milly with all the hospital works up until the day she got abortion. i stood with her like a rock and kept this as a secret never known to anybody.

fast forward to 2025, milly and her allegedly baby daddy broke up due to personal reasons. soon after that she got into another relationship and that guy was her soon to be husband. they got engaged with in a few months into the relationship. Apparently her boyfriend now husband belongs from the same caste\\ethnic group so, her family was very delighted and decided to get her married off. they were supposed to get married on 16th Dec, 2025 in india. i have never travelled across Nepal and let alone attain wedding in India. i asked milly to convince my family to let me go india to attain her wedding. my family would allow if the bride to be would have at least once talked to them but it didn't happen.  
she was supposedly busy meeting with her soon to be family that she hadn't 10 min to spare. she was hanging around with her fiance at 11:30 pm outside my house. i was hoping she would talk to my family but she didnt. yet another day, i found her with her fiance roaming around my home carefree and yet she didnt have urge to talk to my family. i didn't say anything.  she would message me in the middle of the night asking price of a fucking I-phone as i was working in an I-phone store & yet she didn't think of calling my mom. day was approaching and she wouldn't care. one week before her wedding got a message on my whats app and i was shocked. she wrote"" I M OFF TO INDIA WITH MY PARENTS. I M SORRY I COULDN'T TALK TO YOUR FAMILY. PLEASE COME TO NEPAL-INDIA BORDER, I WILL COME PICK YOU UP.""

i was like "" what the FUCK! WHAT THE  ACTUAL FUCK?? did she really left india without meeting me, let alone talk to my family. Is this has all she has to say me?? she very well knew i haven't stepped out of my country even once and here is she inviting me over as if india is just behind me. how can she text me so causally as if we were meeting for a cup of coffee in a cafe. i was totally devastated and upset because of her behaviour. i was angry at myself for being so dumb for a selfish bitch like her. i had plans for her wedding with all pictures and events & all went downhill in a matter of second. in my mind i was constantly questioning myself, what was my worth for her?? was i just her alibi to help her come clean out of her mess?? i was running around amid covid and lockdown. searching ways to protect her secret from making fake blood to taking appointments for her in the hospital and here i was dump founded by the very-so-called best friend who couldn't even care meeting my family for merely 10 minutes for permission. mind you she was bestie for 7 years and my whole family knew about her, met her and wore eagerly excited for her invitation. And her i was, left hanging with a piece of shitty text as an invitation. i argued with her for days. she kept reasoning with me, saying sorry but it wasn't apologetic. i cut contact with her ever since. blocked her from every social media account. she is still friend with my sister on insta, but wouldn't seem to care where i was or how was i doing after her betrayal.

Before I understood these tricks, I used to have episodes every few days at least, if not every day.

1. No caffeine unless directly after a full meal! This was the biggest game-changer for me. Starting my day with coffee on an empty stomach was the worst thing I could do for myself. Was feeling dizzy, lightheaded, etc almost immediately. Now I eat a substantial breakfast (see below) first. 

2. Build every meal around protein, fat, and fiber. This combination has been instrumental to avoiding blood sugar drops for me. I personally also include some carbs as they keep me fuller longer but I know they can trigger some, so they are optional. Regardless, the most important thing I’ve learned is *do not eat carbs on their own!!!* If I want dessert, I always have it right after a meal.

These were the most important things I learned to manage my hypoglycemia, but I’d also suggest thinking about potential non-food related triggers.

# 2025's Top UV Water Filters: Reviews, Comparisons & Expert Recommendations for Commercial Use

Ensuring access to clean and safe water is paramount for any business or organization. in 2025, ultraviolet (UV) water filters are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for commercial applications, offering a chemical-free and highly effective method of water disinfection.This comprehensive guide will delve into the world of commercial UV water filters, providing detailed reviews, comparisons, and expert recommendations to help you make an informed decision for your specific needs. Whether you're a facility manager, a water treatment professional, or a distributor, this guide will equip you with the knowledge necessary to navigate the market and select the best UV water filter system for your organization.

## Why Choose a UV Water Filter for Commercial Use?

Before diving into specific models and brands, let's understand why a commercial UV water filter is an investment worth considering.The advantages are numerous and often outweigh traditional chemical disinfection methods.

**Effectiveness against Microorganisms:** At its core, a UV sterilizer for water utilizes ultraviolet light to neutralize harmful microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Unlike chemical methods that can leave residual chemicals in the water, UV water disinfection alters the DNA/RNA of these pathogens, preventing them from reproducing and effectively rendering them harmless. Studies and real-world applications have demonstrated that UV water purifier systems can eliminate up to 99.999% of these contaminants, providing consistently safe water. According to waterfilterguru.com, this makes it the safest and most effective defense against microbiologically unsafe water.

**Chemical-Free Treatment:** One of the most important benefits of a UV water treatment system is that it doesn't require chemicals like chlorine. This is particularly significant for industries like food and beverage processing, where chemical residues can compromise product quality and taste. A UV water filter ensures that water remains pure and free from unwanted chemicals.

**Environmentally Pleasant:** With increasing pressure on businesses to adopt lasting practices, a UV water purifier presents an environmentally responsible solution. It minimizes the environmental impact associated with the production, transportation, and disposal of chemical disinfectants.**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial uv water filter cost might seem significant, the long-term operational costs are often lower than chemical-based systems. The primary recurring cost is the replacement of the uv water filter bulb, which typically needs to be done annually. This is frequently enough cheaper than the continuous purchase and management of disinfection chemicals.

**Ease of Maintenance:** Regular uv water filter maintenance is straightforward. It primarily involves replacing the UV bulb and occasionally cleaning the quartz sleeve that protects the bulb. The overall maintenance requirements are much simpler compared to the complexities of chemical disinfection systems.

before you can effectively compare different systems, it’s important to understand the core components of a UV water filter, including what they do, and how they affect performance:

*   **UV Lamp:** The heart of the system, this lamp emits ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, which is responsible for inactivating microorganisms.The lamp's wattage and intensity determine the system's effectiveness.
*   **Quartz Sleeve:** A clear tube that surrounds the UV lamp, protecting it from direct contact with the water. The quartz sleeve must be cleaned periodically to prevent mineral buildup and ensure optimal UV light transmission.
*   **Reactor Chamber:** The chamber that houses the UV lamp and quartz sleeve. It’s designed to ensure that water flows evenly around the lamp, maximizing exposure to UV light.
*   **Control Panel:** This panel monitors the system's performance, typically displaying warnings for lamp failure or low UV intensity. More advanced systems might include data logging and remote monitoring capabilities.
*   **Flow Restrictor/Controller**: Some systems are equipped with flow restrictors or controllers. This component governs the speed at which water flows through the reactor chamber. This makes certain that the water comes into proper contact with the UV light to be properly treated.
*   **Pre-Filtration System (Frequently enough Separate):** While not strictly a component of the UV filter itself, pre-filtration is essential. Sediment filters and carbon filters are commonly used to remove particulate matter and improve taste,which can significantly enhance the UV system's performance and lifespan.

## Selecting the right UV Water Filter: Key Considerations

Choosing the right commercial uv water filter involves careful consideration of several factors. Here’s a breakdown of the most important aspects to assess:

**1. Flow Rate:** The flow rate, measured in gallons per minute (GPM), is the most critical specification. It determines the volume of water that the UV sterilizer for water can effectively treat within a given timeframe. Carefully assess the water usage patterns for your facility to determine the required flow rate. Undersizing the system can result in inadequately treated water during peak demand. As an example, a large food processing facility may require an industrial uv water filter system with a very high flow rate, while a smaller office building might only need a whole house uv water filter with a more modest capacity.

**2. UV Dose:** The UV dose refers to the amount of UV energy that the water is exposed to, usually measured in millijoules per square centimeter (mJ/cm²). A higher UV dose ensures a more thorough disinfection. Most commercial applications require a UV dose of at least 40 mJ/cm² to effectively eliminate a wide range of pathogens. Check the uv water filter specifications to ensure it meets this crucial requirement.

**3. water Quality:** UV water filters are most effective when the water is relatively clear and free from turbidity. High levels of sediment or organic matter can reduce UV light transmission and compromise disinfection efficiency. Always conduct a thorough water analysis to determine the need for pre-filtration. If your water source has high levels of turbidity,installing sediment filters before the uv water filter is essential. If you're drawing from a well, ensure proper water testing to identify any specific contaminants that need to be addressed before UV treatment. Thus,understanding the water quality will help determine if you need the best uv water filter for well water.

**4. UV Lamp Type and Lifespan:** UV lamps come in different types, including low-pressure mercury lamps and amalgam lamps. Amalgam lamps generally offer higher UV intensity and longer lifespans. The uv water filter lifespan of the bulb affects the maintenance schedule and replacement costs.Most UV lamps are rated for approximately 9,000 hours of operation (about one year of continuous use), after which the uv water filter bulb needs to be replaced.

**5.Material of construction:** The reactor chamber's material influences the system's durability and longevity.Stainless steel is a preferred option because it is resistant to corrosion and can withstand high pressure and temperature. Ensure that all components are constructed from food-grade or NSF-certified materials to prevent contamination.**6. Certifications and Standards:** Look for UV water filters that are certified by reputable organizations like NSF International or the Water Quality Association (WQA). These certifications indicate that the system has been independently tested and meets established performance and safety standards. Compliance with relevant regulations and standards is especially critical in industries with strict water quality requirements, such as pharmaceutical manufacturing and healthcare.

**7. Installation and Maintenance:** Consider the uv water filter installation requirements and the ongoing maintenance needs. Some systems are relatively easy to install, while others may require professional installation by a qualified plumber or water treatment specialist. Understand the replacement schedule for the uv water filter bulb and other components, and factor in the associated costs. Additionally,consider the ease of accessing and cleaning the quartz sleeve.

**8.Monitoring and Control Features:** advanced uv water treatment system models offer sophisticated monitoring and control features. These systems can track UV intensity, flow rate, and operating hours, and provide alerts for potential issues like lamp failure. Some systems can even be integrated with building management systems for remote monitoring and control.

**9. Point of Entry (POE) vs. Point of Use (POU):** Decide whether you need a whole house uv water filter for point-of-entry (POE) treatment, which treats all the water entering your building, or a point-of-use (POU) system that treats water at a specific tap or appliance. POE systems are generally preferred for comprehensive protection, while POU systems are suitable for specific needs, such as treating water for a laboratory sink or a coffee machine.

**10. Supplier Reputation and Support:** choose a uv water filter manufacturer or supplier with a proven track record of reliability and customer support. Check uv water filter reviews and testimonials to assess the experiences of other customers. Ensure that the supplier offers technical support, warranty coverage, and readily available replacement parts. Establishing a relationship with a reputable supplier can streamline the procurement process and provide ongoing support throughout the system's lifespan.

We chose the place (a coffee shop) and told her we only had half an hour. 

She brought her husband with her, which we were not expecting. Husband and I strategized possible scenarios the night before and went in prepared. Basically the meeting was what everyone (and we) predicted. The ‘apology’ was incredibly middle of the road and did not take any accountability whatsoever. She said she didn’t mean what she said and is sorry that we misconstrued it. She blamed it all on circumstance of losing her dad and being caught up in a lawsuit and said she ‘needed her family more than ever’ and felt we were withdrawing our support. Guilt and making it all about her. No apology or recognition of the hurtful comments she made about me. I was ready to walk out when she started in on her guilt trip.

However, we were also not surprised at all about what happened and even expected it. Husband did great in standing our ground as a couple and did most of the talking. He said that we have expectations moving forward for how they are to interact with us and what we will tolerate. We both left the meeting thinking the apology is not good enough… pretty pathetic that this is what we were waiting for this whole time, and it’s the best she could do. No excitement or congratulations at all that we are 2 months away from welcoming our baby.

That all being said, we said we’d see them at Easter (two months away) but mother-in-law claims to not have planned anything because Christmas went poorly. My family is away as well for the holiday so hubby and I will go to church and relax as I’ll be two weeks away from my due date!

We have no plans to see his parents anytime soon, need a big break, but both of us see pretty clearly their true colours and narcissistic selfish nature. A deep apology will never come. 

Hubby struggling to come to terms with this about his family but we are both learning and coming out stronger as a couple. He has really learned and is coming into his own…

All is well that ends well, for now… there will definitely be more issues from her in the future but we now have practice being firm with her…

If he’s trying to make me feel insecure it’s working. But I can tell I feel flat today because I just… don’t care. I know I care, I know if he ended things I would be distraught, but right now? He could tell me he slept with fifty women over the weekend and never even liked me and has been spending time with me out of pity and I would just think okay whatever and hang up. That’s not based on my feelings for him, it’s based on the fact I feel flat and…. numb. Imagine though, imagine he was changing things to get back out there and I was offering advice for that. He surely would never be that cruel. I can also tell I feel flat because I feel hyper objective about us, and I’m thinking maybe I should just cut the cord and let it be done. But no. I don’t want that. But I just feel so numb. But I can’t let that make decisions for me, obviously. Anyway whatever this is just me feeling low and therefore being easier prey to these thoughts. What is reality? He isn’t one to do that sort of thing. If he’s wanting to date other women then he will drop me. He has not gotten rid of me so therefore he isn’t dating other women. There. And IF it does happen? It will be fine. I will be fine. Everything will be fine. It’s fine. 

That all aside, those photos were so cute. He really is a very cute guy. I’m not oblivious though like I know my feelings make him super attractive to me, if I didn’t know him as a person? Idk. I’d think he’s pretty cute still. He’s just one of those people who has a really nice face but their personality takes them over the edge. I am one of the sorts of people who have neither. Yay. 

I’m not working this afternoon. I’m having it off. As sick leave. I’ve watched YT videos of some guy that hikes and talks way too peppily and then I played my games and then I lay on my bed and stared out the window and then Andy called me again to go to the shop. I did some cleaning after :) I broomed the walls for dandy long leg spider webs and whatnot and cleaned the bathroom and my bedroom and surfaces etc. So just need to vacuum and that’s about it. And kitchen. But we’re not going all out. This is a place that’s lived in after all, and it’s pretty clean anyway. Not really thanks to M but whatever. If I have a higher standard then that’s on me. 

I feel so ugh. I’m not happy. Sometimes I feel it at my very core like this dark deep rotten hole inside of me. I feel like I’m the earth and I have these layers of feelings. The inner core is black and rotten. Or maybe actually no. Let me start again. The core is not at all, the inner core is happy and bright and hopeful. The outer core is a bleached version of that but it’s still there. The mantles, that’s where it’s fragile and rotten. The crust is where I start to become shakey and can dip into a low period. The crust is dependent on my day to day eg how I’m feeling and when I get cheered up or upset. And the atmosphere is my general facade I put up, or try to, to keep it all together and moving along. So I think I am like planet earth. Only planet earth is magical and beautiful and just…. Awe inspiring? That seems the right word. Me? Lolllllllllsssssssssssss. 

I’ve not really eaten today. I made a coffee around 11…ish. And then I had a little bowl of leftover fried rice for dinner at 7ish. And that’s it. I also had a diet coke and bottle of water. I’ve just felt idk. I’ve felt unhappy. I felt numb early in the day and I just left that bubble and entered a new bubble of feeling sad and hopeless about everything. But I didn’t have a whole bowl of rice so I guess I have some for lunch tomorrow. I will make a new batch tomorrow I think, it’s easy and I have a lot of rice and frozen veggies, frozen edamame and eggs to get through. It’s also yum. 

I have a headache. I wish I didn’t have to do anything ever.

- Black coffee and water only, no zero sugar zero calories drinks
- Doing gym for 45-60 mins.
PPL split but avoiding leg days due to injury and doing slow cardio. (Walking on inclines etc)

I managed to put on some muscle and get some strength, especially in my chest and back

I know most of the weight I lost is excess water and due to having a higher fiber diet.
My goal is to reach 72kgs. (21M 5'7"", 80.7kgs now)

I just wanted some feedback from the community.

PS - some footballers know this issue. I gained huge thighs and glutes due to football practice, I can squat 75-80kgs and have good strength, but I want to lose the muscle and get slightly thinner legs for fitting better into pants. Hips, glutes and thighs. Once it is manageable, I want to remove leg days and focus on more practical leg exercises like endurance sports, weighted hikes, weighted cycling, instead of squats and leg curls. Argument can be made that leg day in gym can also correlate to practical movement, but it is easy for me to gain leg muscles from gym which I want to avoid too much of.

I can’t get over the mistake of leaving a good job in defence. Now I feel like I’m not where I want to be in life.

I started in August, everything seemed great, but it wasn’t. My manager didn’t like me for some reason. I think I intimidated her, here’s why:

She asked for help with her PC, I tried to help her, she shooed me away with her hand when I couldn’t figure out the problem.

The co leader made a comment about my frizzy hair in the 2nd week of the job. I thought it was a joke so I let it slide. My colleague came back from outside with an umbrella in her hand, so I asked if it was raining, she said, no it’s drizzling, but I don’t want to get my hair frizzy. I said, neither do I. He said, but your hair is already frizzy. I said his name in a jokey way to show I couldn’t believe he said that. He said, but it’s true, it’s frizzy. 

I arranged lunch with him as one of my goals was to get to know my colleagues and he was one of the few people in the office. He came over to speak to me and said” I can’t understand a word you say, it’s hard to understand you because you don’t even open your mouth when you speak”. I couldn’t believe he said this! I was in shock and said I’ll try and speak better then he said you mustn’t change a thing. Really didn’t want to go to lunch but didn’t want to cancel on the co head of the department.

Came back from a meeting, the director asked how I found it, I said great and asked if I could ask some questions, he said sure! My manager rolled her eyes at him. 

Several things happened which made me think I wasn’t liked or fitted in. I’m the only woc there along with an Asian man. This isn’t an issue as I have been the only woc in my old job. Colleagues inviting everyone for coffee, so I went to, they seemed annoyed that I came and one guy actively avoided speaking to me. But in the office, he would speak to me.

Manager was sat next to me and asked my colleague if he had heard from me, he said not really, she said what on earth is wrong with her! I went to my car and cried.  She constantly vaped in the office and spoke to me in harsh tones but I let it slide because I was new and she was nice most of the time. 

My colleague who is my buddy had been ignoring my emails when I asked for a catch-up. The next day I left. I have a freelance job which earns more than that role but the job is not stable. I had a ftc in a finance job which ended in Feb. Now, I feel like I should have gone to hr to complain, stayed and played the game. A part of me thinks I made an impulsive choice to leave the next day. 

I told myself to never work in that area again, as I had a job there before where I left the next day due to my racist colleague whose mum ran the senior department. The first day he shouted at me down the phone for not being able to find him in the car park, I froze. He also said” my manager has no power really, his mum is more senior”. 

However, I really needed a new job as my old one was laying everyone off. Something told me not to go into defence because I had moral issues. 

How do I make better decisions in the future? I did speak to another woc grad there who confirmed the racism and that she planned to leave aswell. Am I just making bad choices in life? Why can’t I find a good job to fit me. I went to therapy for years to tackle child hood issues and my eating issue. We also touched on this issue, but I thought I solved it. I’m trying to keep myself busy by doing more courses to improve my job prospects.

I even made a fool of myself. I emailed the other director to let him know I had left( he was travelling overseas), he was very fond of me and sent me a nice message. The next day I asked him if he could reconsider the job. My partner said I should ask. I also spoke to hr as she gave me her number if anything changes. The recruiter who got me the job told me to call hr as the company needs to sort their practices out. I spoke to her and explained the issue she said we could have resolved it and the business may not want someone who makes impulsive decisions like that. Which is true, I just need to work on this. The reason I didn’t mention the racism to her when leaving is because hr works for the company and I couldn’t accuse the co head of being racist as a newbie, it was clear I wasn’t wanted there by my manager or colleague( it’s a small team of 4). After quitting, my period came and it was the worst. I don’t know if this has something to do with my emotions. ",1,1741157732.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,1.0,False

1j3x995,https://www.reddit.com/r/vce/comments/1j3x995/crafting_texts_feedback/,crafting texts feedback,"my sac is on friday so please give me some feedback on my base essay. 

The cult of girlhood is built on small sacrifices. A centimetre shaved off in a group photo. A voice softened to be more agreeable. A feature disowned before it can be criticised. I learned this early. I was four years old when I first felt the weight of it—sitting cross-legged on the kindergarten floor, pressing my arm against my friend’s, expecting sameness. Instead, I found difference. A row of golden skin—until mine broke the pattern. Pale. Stark. Out of place. It wasn’t an insult. It wasn’t even a comment. Just an observation, one that should have meant nothing. But I went home that night, and though I didn’t know the word for it, I understood that I was lacking. Indoctrination happens in whispers, in glances, in things too small to name. At seventeen, I book spray tans before every formal, carefully layering my skin with something borrowed, something learned.

I was the tall one.

At first, that meant something good. I could reach the highest branches, run faster, stand out. But what once felt like a gift quickly became a reason to shrink. My friends treated their stature like a game—who could be the smallest, the most delicate, the most enviable. A game I could never win. In every school photo, I bent my knees slightly, tucked myself away, made myself less. I quieted thoughts before they reached my lips, softened opinions until they were barely more than whispers. I became fluent in the art of hesitation—of second-guessing, of stepping back, of making space for others while convincing myself I didn’t need it. I shrank not just in presence but in conviction, in certainty, in the right to be seen. Years later, I find myself surrounded by friends who are my height, or taller. Was it a choice? Coincidence? Or a quiet rebellion against the years I spent trying to shrink? Perhaps it was the first crack in my devotion.

Then there was my nose. A nose I had never thought twice about, until one day it became a topic of discussion, dissected with casual detachment as though I wasn’t there to hear it. “You can always get a nose job, ‘my name’,” someone had said, light-hearted, simple, like suggesting a new haircut or a different shade of nail polish. That was the day I learned that even the features you never hated could become something to be fixed. Ritual sacrifice, but for beauty.

We call them the cult now, my friends and I. A joke, except the more I think about it, the less funny it becomes. A group forged not just by friendships but by a shared identity, an unspoken set of rules dictated by their mothers—women who gathered in cafés every morning, sipping on frappes, their conversations shaping the daughters they raised. I was one of them, but never truly. I didn’t tan the right way, my mother worked too much to sit in coffee shops, and I cared too deeply about school. Try-hard. Overachiever. Teacher’s pet. The words were always said with a smile, wrapped in laughter, but I learned quickly that even jokes stop being funny. I laughed along, nodding at the right moments, playing my part. But there was always a pause, a beat too long before I answered, a hesitation they never had. They spoke the language fluently; I was always translating.

For years, I adapted. I learned the script. I followed the rules. I laughed at the jokes that made me small. Until, one day, I didn’t. The shift wasn’t sudden. There was no grand moment of defiance. Just the slow erosion of belief, the growing suspicion that maybe I had spent too long bending, twisting, shrinking. Maybe I wasn’t the one who needed fixing.

The memory of that realisation still tastes like salt—tears shed for years lost to insecurity, for the version of me that never got to exist. I close my eyes and smell the coconut oil from those endless spray tans, feel the ache in my calves from years of slouching. These sensory ghosts remind me of what I escaped.

I still see them sometimes, the girls who shaped and nearly shattered me. In coffee shops where their mothers once sat, in shopping malls where we used to roam. Some have changed. Some remain frozen in the patterns established years ago. I feel neither bitter nor superior. Just grateful—for the lessons, for the leaving, for the learning that followed.

The cult thrives on conformity, but freedom lies in divergence. Growth blooms in the spaces between expectation and authenticity. Every step away from them was a step toward myself: painful, necessary, liberating.

We all face moments where we must choose between belonging and becoming. Between the comfortable embrace of conformity and the terrifying, exhilarating free-fall of authenticity. My story isn’t just my own. It is the universal journey of self-acceptance. Some will never tell it. Some will never live it. But those who do—those who dare to stand tall and speak truth—they create ripples of possibility for everyone watching. And that, I think, is worth everything.

I will be posting the transcript of the interview towards the end of the post, but here are a few pointers which worked in my favour vs what you should avoid doing. 

**What Worked:**

1. I think the number one thing I can advice to people is to actually go out there and talk to officers who are in ""interesting"" positions. 
2. Before my interview, the collector, the commissioner, VC of a university, an IPS officer were very happy and eager to talk to me hearing that I am slated to appear for the interview. 
3. I spent 1-2 hours with the Collector and Commissioner, half an hour talking to the VC, and around 2-3 hours talking to the IPS officer. 
4. The kind of information and insights I gained from talking to these people was way beyond what a video, or a mock interview could have taught me. 
5. First advice would be to reach out to people in the services and talk to them about as many topics as you can. Reach out to professors, they will be eager to help. Anybody who is appearing for the PT is respected a lot. Don't take this lightly and leverage your success in the mains to the fullest extent. 
6. The IPS officer I talked to had served in the Dantewada region for 7+ years, seeing LWE in front of his eyes. Being from Chhattisgarh, I knew there would a question on LWE, and the kind of insights I gained from talking to him were phenomenal. I could cite the ground reality situation, nitty gritties, name places which do not even find mention in any document, report, current affair compilation etc. So my answers to these questions were absolutely grounded in reality and practicality. 
7. The second advice would be to go through the transcripts, everyday, be updated with what questions are being asked inside the boardrooms. There is a high probability some or the other question might be repeated, if not the question, the thread or stream of thought, or simply the act of brainstorming on the particular question might help you a lot. There are a certain themes which repeat again and again and they are specific to boards so analyse these trends. 
8. Listen to more current affairs than reading them. Watch Palki Sharma's VANTAGE, that show helped me gain a lot of eloquence, command on the topics, and a birds eye view. Palki ma'am is really an inspiration of all women and men out there, I have huge respect for her. Another show you can watch is Cut the Clutter by the Print and Sansad TV debates. Indian Express podcast is also good sometimes. 
9. Be clear with the static and basics and your optional subject. Don't be surprised if a question on static comes in the interview, be ready to apply those concepts of economy, polity, environment and base the ""suggestions"" you give on these basic concepts only. 
10. The anatomy of an interview answer: 
   1. Acknowledge the question \[Don't repeat it, but summarise it, so as to make it clear that you do understand\]
   2. Always answer objectively \[Firstly, secondly, thirdly. Primarily, Secondarily. First order, Second order, Third order\] 
   3. Always support your answer with evidence. The thing that works in Mains also works in the interview. Spice up your answer with a lot of data, citing reports, citing people. 
11. One thing that stood out in my interview was how I used anecdotes from my own life. While answering a question, I never hesitated to say things like ""Sir, last week I was reading an article by Mr. Ashok Gulati and he said.."" / ""Sir during my tenure at XYZ company I witnessed ABC and that has made me realise/gain the skills.."" 
12. This way you make your answers more personalised, realistic and grounded in practicality. 
13. Never hesitate to call a spade a spade. Although you should be mild and sober with your words, but acknowledge the problems where they exist. Like for example you cannot debate the fact that India is the accident capital of the world, our poverty or inequality numbers. But with that being said, you can always temper your answer by citing how much progress we have made in the past few years/decades and what lays ahead in the terms of way forward. You can also give your own unique/creative inputs as to how you think this particular issue can be resolved. 
14. Your dressing, smile, overall demeanour, and choice of words matter a lot. Learn how to speak eloquently and with grace and precision. Pause before you craft an answer and use the very precise words to convey your ideas \[This is why I recommend listening more rather than reading more - listen to people who are great speakers like Jordan Peterson, Christopher Hitchens etc.\] 
15. Know absolutely everything you need to know about your DAF. Do a 3-level analysis, with every level of question being done with a SWOT angle. 
16. Have a tinge of optimism in your answers, there should be a flair of positivity when you speak an answer. Having a little smile from time to time helps. 
17. Don't hesitate from using kind humour once or twice. If you can make the board laugh, nothing like it. \[Be extremely smooth and cautious with it though, it should be extremely natural, avoid this altogether if this is not your thing\] 
18. Study what are ""officer like qualities"" - imbibe them truly in your personality. 
19. One thing you must note is that you are being interviewed for a position of ""authority"" - boldness, quick decision making, delegation are qualities that are required of you - Be bold and precise in your answers. In questions which are debatable, or have two sides of the coin, never hesitate to take a side and defend it to the very extreme with proper facts and figures and anecdotes. Instead of being a dicey individual who debates both sides of the issue, it is much better to pick a side and fight for it. I was very clear on this fact. Take a good and solid stand. 
20. Know the basics of psychology - mirroring, negotiation tactics, eye contact. \[Learn how to hold a solid eye contact, and I mean look into their eyes as if you are staring into their souls\] the kind of confidence it conveys is absolutely unmatchable. 
21. Sit straight, but comfortably, rest your hands on your knees, but don't stretch it. Sit on the back of the chair, not on the edge as it makes you more uncomfortable and activates adrenaline responses. 
22. Always remember, the UPSC is looking for readymade officers whom they can pick. They don't wanna make officers. So absorb those qualities. Look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself that you deserve it. Clearing a ruthless prelims and even cumbersome mains is no joke. You deserve the respect, treatment and the conversation you are going to have. 
23. Lastly, it will be an experience of your lifetime. It is extremely rare that you will find such 5 accomplished individual in a single room, with all their attention towards you, lending you an ear to listen to your thoughts and know more about you. Simply think of what an absolute bonkers opportunity and event this is. Be grateful for it, and appreciate it, ace it. Make it a celebratory event, rather than a test. After all, it is nothing but a conversation.

**What did not Work:**

1. Obscure current affairs compilations. 
2. Too many mock interviews - this is a controversial one - I simply gave 3 very bad mock interviews. They made me wait a lot, the board asked either too simple, or too extreme questions. Some questions felt irrelevant and borderline inciting. Their reviews were vague at best and their motivational words felt like false promises. 
3. I have learned way more from watching topper's interviews than actually giving a mock myself, but just because everyone does it, give at least 2-3 mocks. 
4. Deep diving into current affairs and spending hours on it. 
5. Listening to too much advice from a lot of people. \[Keep your inputs minimum\]

Lastly, I leave you with my transcript:

Before visiting Barky's Bar, the Agents decided to take a look at some of the blood samples they'd taken back at the hospital. This is something that I really, *really* wish I'd handled better. The original idea was that the contaminant causing the Dreamlands disease, the ""ink"", initially gathers in the brain tissue of patients- so, ordinary bloodwork cannot detect it. MRIs and other imaging can, but it appears as gaps or noise in the image and can be mistaken for a problem with the device itself. All of this was intended to explain why the medical staff at the hospital never identified it.

However, in a spur-of-the-moment decision, I figured that the material might leak back out into the bloodstream after it's done its' ""job"" of yanking the afflicted into the Dreamlands, and so the patient who'd recently coded would have some in her system that the Agents could detect. Detect it they did, and ignored the fact that only the patient who'd coded had any signs of it so that they could cast aspersions on the medical center's own pathology lab for missing something so ""obvious"". So far so good, that conclusion is on them, not me, but then they called Dr. Parsons at the hospital and advised him to try dialysis on the remaining patients. *Based on the properties of the disease as I had just established them*, this should do nothing at all since the material should still be confined to their brain tissue and not accessible to a dialysis filter. However, I also wanted to communicate that any tampering with the action of the material sufficient to sever a patient's connection with the Dreamlands, is itself lethal- so, I decided that after a few hours of dialysis, one of the patients would experience the same seizure-and-brain-death process as the others. This, of course, would make the properties of the material contradict each other, although the Agents didn't seem to put this together when they learned about it.

I *did* get to reference that excellent 1980s *None More Black* rework someone posted about here, though, when Dr. Voss checked to see if DG had any history with a substance like this:

>The *best* match is a substance code-numbered K1:232-B, a flaky black material first encountered as part of a psychedelic drug in Miami in 1985. It was causing anyone who ingested it to interact with the noosphere, with a greater than 30% chance of never regaining consciousness. The drug manufacturer used unknown methods to cause massive quantities of the same material to appear and asphyxiate one Agent, before being shot and killed by another.

After that, everyone moved on to reconnoiter Barky's and had a long conversation with the owner's now-widow, Alice. They also happily imbibed the coffee she offered them, sitting in her loft apartment directly above the bar where the five people currently in the ICU and another currently in the morgue were frequent drinkers...

They managed to convince Alice to let them see the transaction records for the bar, identifying all the current patients as heavy drinkers, along with a few out-of-towners and one other name, Meg Cotton:

>""Oh, right... *her*. Every three days, just like clockwork. Orders neat vodka until she can't hardly stand, Travis's usually the one who drives her home, takes a bottle for the road. Poor dear, I think she has some, some, you know, troubles. The mental kind.""

She also mentioned that since her and Gary's own son has been making a fool of himself out in San Francisco for the better part of a decade now, they were thinking of selling the bar to ""Rob and his wife"", who have been coming by frequently to talk business as a result; and that before he fell ill Gary had been ""fooling around downstairs with that stupid furnace all day and not making any headway"". The Agents somehow concluded from this testimony that *Rob* was the Copelands' son and Alice had not seen him in over a year despite both of them living in the same town (and not San Francisco), but they picked up on the mention of a furnace connection right quick. So they asked Alice to let them into the basement.

>The basement is a cramped, narrow cinderblock space mostly dominated by metal shelving racks, loose cinderblocks, and what looks like an oil-powered furnace of roughly 1940s-1960s vintage. The lone light bulb glints off of a pool of grimy, leaking fuel oil.

A more detailed examination reveals a camp stove, canned food well past its sell-by date, and some positively *ancient* car batteries and a Geiger counter on the shelves, still in a faded cardboard box stamped with the Civil Defense logo. The supports are bent out of shape, with additional metal strips bolted in place. A more modern cordless power drill is sitting nearby on top of a plastic tackle-box toolkit, half-in a puddle of spilled oil. The oil doesn't look like it's coming from the furnace, actually. It's coming from past the cinderblocks, which look more like the first two or three courses of a wall with a doorway in the middle- i.e., deliberately mortared.

They took some samples and retreated to the van to run tests and don better protective gear, and Dr. Voss got a bit of a shock when she held a lighter up to one of the ""oil"" samples and it flowed directly towards the flame. Dr. Rook got the idea of trying to apply the stuff to his mirror:

>Instead of having no reflection, the liquid appears like a gap or void. You can look *through* it in the mirror, to some kind of space beyond. There's a black sky, dark soil, and what look like bare, gray trees or rough columns.

On their way back to the bar with drills, crowbars, and protective suits, everyone had to make CON rolls. Rook and Voss just got headaches and a bit of queasiness, but Parker had a full-on out of body experience before spotting Rob the Finance Bro heading off down the block in the other direction.

I was, quite frankly, amazed that *nobody picked up the Geiger counter in the basement* during either trip down there, or sought out a more modern one- especially after they started feeling nauseous, achy, and tired. Two of these players [had been with me for a previous scenario that was *specifically* about screwing investigators over with radiation](https://www.reddit.com/r/callofcthulhu/comments/18wq3j2/comment/kfzkriv/). It's *not* radiation this time around, although I would have had them pick up slightly elevated background readings from the structure on the other side of the back wall.

The original *Regency Cthulhu* scenario claims that the ""inexpertly constructed"" single-layer brick wall blocking the passage deeper into the basement, takes *between ""a couple of"" and 14* ***hours*** to clear away. Even without power tools this seemed implausible to me, so I allowed the Agents to pry and bash through it in about 30 minutes.

Actually, I am seriously considering *making* what's on the other side of the wall highly radioactive if I wanted to stall for time like the original scenario does. Either Agents charge in and accept the consequences, or have to secure suits and dosemeter badges from some other location. However, this seems like padding for padding's sake.

I had a *lot* of fun with descriptions for the area on the other side:

>The tunnel looks almost like something you'd expect to find on a ship: it seems to be made out of rusty iron or steel panels, bent into shape and attached by some kind of very neat welding that leaves only extremely narrow seams. There's little spines or hooks completely covering the sides, some with strands of -copper? something patina green- wire still hanging from them. There are no lights or other fittings, nor any spaces where they might have been. There's about a foot of dirt between the cinderblock wall and the start of the hallway; the metal plating starts with a sharp, smooth line, about 30 degrees off perpendicular from the axis of the tube. The black liquid is flowing across the... ceiling?? in a thin stream; when it hits the end of the hall, it drips onto the floor- previously, it was splattering against the cinderblock wall.

>As you look down the tunnel, there's something *off* about it. It *wobbles*, almost like a heat haze, but in smooth sheets and sharp planes. Sometimes it seems to bend one way, and then another. Parker's flashlight hand naturally moves a little when he talks, and when he does there is a noticeable *lag* between the flashlight changing direction, and the spot of light further into the tunnel. Traveling any distance is disorienting to the extreme; it feels like you're on the deck of a ship, and the knowledge that it's not you or the floor moving, but something *else*, maybe gravity itself, makes the feeling worse. You try to walk in a straight line, but find yourself needing to constantly course-correct to avoid getting too close to the spiny walls and potentially ripping your suit. The copper sections get more numerous and more intact as you go on, but the wall plates seem to become misaligned, so you can see through the seams between them into inky blackness.

>The tunnel is, probably, about 100 feet long, and... straight-ish? It looks straight, and the wobbliness you feel as you traverse it seems to average itself out. The other end opens out into a larger chamber, a sort of low, broad beehive shape made out of coils upon coils of copper wire. Originally it would have been covering nearly every square inch of the walls and ceiling, but enough has fallen away that you can see the iron or steel plates underneath. More plates make up the floor. The only immediately visible breaks in the wiring on the walls are a pair of dark holes about 90 degrees apart, facing the tunnel entrance; wrapped in more coils of copper wire around donut-shaped iron forms, they look sort of like stoma or valves, almost organic. In the center of the floor is a ring-shaped barrier about a foot high and two feet wide, made out of some kind of dull, dark gray, smooth material. There are two markings visible on the sides, 90 degrees apart, and a crack in the middle, directly across from the opening of the tunnel. Black fluid is flowing out of the crack, across the floor plates, and then dripping *upward* onto the ceiling of the tunnel, where it forms the stream you have been seeing.

Voss took some notes on the symbols she found etched into the central ring, connecting them back to the native population of this specific area. Rook looked a little too closely at one of the holes in the wall:

>The coil-wrapped opening seems to distort around you, yanking you vertiginously through a suffocating space of cold, damp, heavy earth. You find yourself briefly standing in another, smaller underground chamber, one made of stone and packed earth, infiltrated by tree roots. There is some kind of armature in the center made of twisted, jagged metallic elements intersecting each other at crazy angles, but just as you are about to take a closer look you are hauled back to your body in the beehive chamber and the vision is over.

>Tobin: ""I... think so... it's hard to explain, stay clear of those holes in the wall. I think they connect to another place, just like putting that oil on my mirror connected to somewhere else""

>""Naomi looks at the holes more closely before backing away.""

Why have one guy lose sanity when *everyone* can lose Sanity in sequence? Sometimes I don't know if I want to hug my players or strangle them.

Heading back out of the chamber, the return of cell phone reception informed the Agents that, after spending about 10-15 minutes in total inside the structure, some four hours had passed outside. They'd gotten a couple of texts, one from Alice Copeland and a bunch from Dr. Parsons.

They decided to check in with Alice first (as you do when a medical doctor you've charged with the safety of Unnatrually-afflicted coma patients keeps messaging you). Since they'd impressed her with the urgency of the situation in their previous meeting and also generally been pleasant, she'd been doing a bit of digging through Gary's business records on their behalf, having half-remembered him hanging onto some odd papers. These turned out to be an invoice and work order from the original refitting of the bar's basement in 1957 (something else that, in future runs of the game, I would want to make into a proper handout). It was from a local company called ""Williams & Sons Construction"" and listed the people performing the work as James Grumman, Todd Howard, and Samuel Williams. The Agents asked why Gary might've held onto it, and Alice is unsure. They *do* make the connection between Robert Williams the finance-bro and this mysterious ""Sam"", however, and quiz Alice about him:

>He came back a few years ago, and the newspaper interviewed him and things... he was some kind of millionaire or something, everyone said, but all he ever did was fool around adding onto his house near the park. Rob, the man we were thinking of selling the bar to, that's his son.  
""It was Rob's idea, Sal didn't even... actually, he and Gary went out of their way to avoid each other. 'No point in bothering Sal', Gary always said. Rob was always very polite, but... he made it clear he really, *really* wanted the bar. He said he'd pay any price for it... frankly, he made me nervous, and I told Gary to hold off.""

After that, I decided to have Dr. Parsons make another attempt at contacting the Agents. This time he made it through, and delivered the bad news: the patient they'd attempted dialysis on, Higgs, had also suffered some form of seizure and was showing zero brain activity.",1,1741156981.0,DeltaGreenRPG,0,1.0,False
1j3x3ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1j3x3ib/not_sure_how_to_feel_about_how_i_feel/,Not sure how to feel about how I feel?,"Me 28m and my husband 33m have been together for 10 years and we’ve been thru many ups and downs, but for the past year or so we’ve started having some lulls in our sex life and intimacy. He has cheated on me once before and I’ve unfortunately returned the favor. Recently we’ve started to sort of play with others in an attempt to bring a bit more fun and excitement. We’ve cruised in parks and been to some bathhouses a few times, and then in an effort to find more cruising spots ended up finding the website sniffies, we both use the same account and it says we are a couple and everything on there. So we recently found this pup in our local area and started to talk to him. O I should mention that I was fairly thin when me and my husband met originally, and now I’m a bit chubbier, but I’m really into bigger men. My husband is a big boy but he’s into thinner guys. Okay so that out of the way, this pup that we met and talked to is fairly thin and quite cute and has a lot of shared interests as my husband and since we started playing with other people one of our rules is that we play together, this pup also like chubby guys and has a partner who is a big boy, they also play with other people but not together necessarily their relationship seems to be more open and they don’t really care what the other does as long as they come home to eachother at night kinda deal. So us and skinny pup exchange numbers and take the conversation off of sniffies. My husband and him talk for a bit and decide to arrange a day to go get coffee but it’s on a day that they both know that I work and can’t call out of, sometimes I can leave early but the day comes and it turns out to not be one of those days, they decide to postpone it to be a little later in the day so I could likely join in but i kinda was feeling a little jealous and I had to stay at work a little later anyway to take care of some things before I dip out so I decided to not go. I told my husband it’s fine if he goes without me but then he tells me that instead of going out to food or coffee that he’s just going to go to skinny pup’s house. I really should’ve just said no but I really didn’t know how to feel and I just said okay. Turns out I didn’t really feel okay about it. Now it’s the following week and he invited us over again but this time I was able to leave work early to go with. Thing is I don’t really like this guy but my husband does. I don’t know if I described the situation the best but… idk we went and I felt okay hut after a while I just didn’t want to be there anymore and I’m not attracted to this guy, and then my stepmom texts me saying her mom died so I stepped outside and wanted to leave anyway so I texted my husband what happened and asked if it was okay if we both just left. My stepmom didn’t want us to go see her rn so we didn’t but I kinda made it seem like we needed to go deal with that but before he left skinny pup apartment I made it clear thru text that we weren’t going to go see my stepmom but that I just wanted to leave and he made it clear that he didn’t really want to leave if it wasn’t because of my stepmom but he stilll walked out of the apartment and came to the truck with me. 

I hope this made a little bit of sense as to what the situation is, I’m really not great at explaining stuff or telling a story, but yeah idk I’m feeling pretty jealous over this pup and idk if I’m justified in that feeling. I’m not worried about them fucking necessarily I’m mostly worried that my husband is going to develop feelings for pup and have him as a whole ass side piece and that it will be the end of our relationship, this guys is so much hotter than me and he’s basically super perfect but I kinda think he’s a little bit of a douche ngl. They also have a lot of similar interest like they’re both in the same line of work and I’m very much not in that line of work so idk am I tripping or…",2,1741156971.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------------

When you combine alcohol with ice cream, something remarkable happens: the ice cream becomes softer and creamier. Understanding the science behind this phenomenon can help you make delicious homemade ice creams that are exceptionally smooth and enjoyable. But why does alcohol have this effect, and how can you make the most of it?

To grasp why alcohol makes ice cream softer, it’s essential to look at the freezing point depression. When you add alcohol to ice cream, the freezing point of the mixture decreases. Alcohol doesn't freeze at standard ice cream temperatures, which are usually around -20°F (-29°C). This means that when you mix alcohol into your ice cream base, it disrupts the formation of ice crystals. Instead of forming hard, icy chunks, the ice cream remains smoother and less solid.

Alcohol is a smaller molecule than the dairy fat or sugar that make up most of your ice cream. This small molecular size allows alcohol to interact uniquely with the water present in the ice cream. It disrupts the arrangement of water molecules, making it harder for them to bond and form solid ice crystals. As a result, you end up with a creamier texture that melts more easily in your mouth.

Now, let’s talk about the best types of alcohol to use in your ice cream recipes. Here are five fantastic options:

- **Bourbon:** With its rich, caramelly flavor, bourbon add depth to vanilla or chocolate ice cream. A few tablespoons can enhance your dessert's overall taste and keep it smooth.
- **Brandy:** This fruit-based spirit pairs perfectly with ice creams that contain fruit like peach or pear. Its sweet notes can elevate your homemade ice cream to gourmet status.
- **Rum:** Especially dark rum, which has a molasses-like flavor. Perfect in coconut or banana ice cream, rum can add a tropical twist while ensuring that the texture remains unbeatable.
- **Kahlúa:** This coffee-flavored liqueur works wonders with chocolate ice cream. The coffee notes can make the dessert richer without hardening it up.
- **Vodka:** Although neutral in flavor, vodka works wonders in all types of ice creams. You can add it without changing the taste significantly, and it will still keep your ice cream perfectly soft.

While you might be temped to take a guess on how much alcohol to use, a good rule of thumb is to add about 1 to 2 tablespoons of alcohol per quart of ice cream base. You can adjust this amount based on your personal preference and the type of alcohol you are using. The beauty of this method is that not only will your ice cream stay soft, but the flavors can also complement one another beautifully.

Make the Perfect Ice Cream--&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com  
  
It's important to keep in mind that using too much alcohol can backfire, resulting in a slushy texture instead of creamy softness. The key is moderation, allowing you to sample various flavors without compromising the integrity of your dessert.

To summarize, alcohol is essential for achieving soft and creamy ice cream. Its properties prevent ice crystals from forming, giving you that delightful texture we all crave. Experimenting with different types of alcohol can lead to unique recipes and flavor combinations, making your ice cream experience even more enjoyable. Next time you make your favorite ice cream, consider adding a splash of one of these delicious spirits and savor the enhanced texture and taste.

Whether for a summer barbecue or an indulgent dessert night, your homemade ice cream will definitely stand out. Enjoy the process and have fun discovering how different alcohols can elevate your frozen treats!

Top 5 Alcohol Types to Use for a Creamier Ice Cream Experience
--------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating the perfect homemade ice cream, the addition of alcohol can elevate the texture and flavor in delightful ways. You may wonder why this is the case. Alcohol lowers the freezing point of ice cream, which means that the freeze process is altered, allowing ice crystals to form in a smoother way. This results in a creamier texture that many people enjoy. Not all types of alcohol yield the same result, though—some enhance flavor while others contribute to texture. Here are five of the best alcohol types to consider for that ultimate creamy experience.

### 1. Vodka

Vodka is a versatile choice that doesn’t overpower the ice cream’s natural flavors. Its high alcohol content makes it an excellent ingredient for keeping ice cream soft without adding too much sweetness. This means you can create a base that remains scoopable even after freezing. Plus, if you’re crafting a fruit-based ice cream, vodka complements flavors like strawberry or peach beautifully. Use about 2 tablespoons of vodka per quart of ice cream for optimal creaminess.

Make the Perfect Ice Cream--&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com  
  
### 2. Rum

Rum brings a warm, rich depth to ice cream, making it a fantastic option for tropical flavors. Whether you’re whipping up a coconut or banana ice cream, rum enhances the overall flavor while helping maintain a smooth texture. The sweetness of dark rum can work wonders in creating comforting desserts like rum raisin ice cream. Aim for 1 to 2 tablespoons of rum for each quart for that soft, creamy result.

### 3. Bourbon

If you’re a fan of whiskey flavors, bourbon is a must-try. It adds a delightful complexity and a touch of sweetness that can take your vanilla or chocolate ice cream to a whole new level. The unique notes of caramel and vanilla in bourbon pair beautifully with cocoa or nut-based flavors. Just be careful not to add too much; around 1 tablespoon per quart is often enough to keep the ice cream soft without overwhelming the initial flavor.

### 4. Tequila

For those who want a zesty twist, tequila is an exciting option. It can add a wonderful complexity, particularly in citrus-flavored ice creams like lime or orange. Just like vodka, tequila's neutral flavor can allow fruit notes to shine while contributing to a creamy texture. A tablespoon or so for every quart will help your ice cream maintain its ideal consistency.

### 5. Liqueurs

Liqueurs are sweetened spirits that can pack a punch of flavor. Options like Amaretto or Bailey’s Irish Cream can impart delightful tastes that blend seamlessly into your ice cream. Amaretto adds a nutty sweetness, making it perfect for almond or vanilla ice creams, while Bailey’s can enhance chocolate or coffee varieties. Just use sparingly, as a few tablespoons usually suffice to keep your dessert creamy.

Make the Perfect Ice Cream--&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com  
  
Remember, while alcohol can help achieve that creamy texture, it’s essential to keep the quantity within reason. Adding too much can lead to a slush instead of a sumptuous scoop. Combining alcohol with your favorite cream base can deliver a dessert experience unlike any other, offering a smooth and rich mouthfeel.

As you explore these alcohol types, consider experimenting with combinations or even creating your own unique flavors. Imagine a bourbon vanilla ice cream or a tequila lime sorbet; the possibilities are endless when you incorporate these flavorful spirits. Enjoy the process as you whip up new ice cream concoctions, and revel in the creamy delight that alcohol can bring to your frozen desserts!

### Conclusion

Understanding how alcohol affects the texture of ice cream can enhance your homemade dessert experience. The science points to the simple fact that alcohol lowers the freezing point of ice cream. This means that when you add even a small amount to your mixture, it disrupts the formation of ice crystals, allowing for a softer, creamier treat. By incorporating alcohol, you achieve a delightful balance between flavor and silky consistency, ensuring every spoonful is a joy to enjoy.

When it comes to selecting the right alcohol for your ice cream creations, the options are vast. The top five alcohol types—vodka, rum, bourbon, stout, and flavored liqueurs—each bring unique flavors and textures to your dessert. Vodka is perfect for those who want minimal flavor interference, letting the ice cream's natural tastes shine through. Rum, on the other hand, adds a lovely depth, perfect for tropical-inspired concoctions. Meanwhile, bourbon contributes warmth and richness, while stouts introduce a delightful chocolate undertone. flavored liqueurs like amaretto or fruit-infused options provide an exciting twist, lifting your ice cream to new heights.

Experimenting with these alcohol types can lead you to discover fun and unique flavor combinations, making your ice cream experience a memorable one. Whether you’re crafting a tasty treat for a special occasion or simply indulging in a moment of self-care, understanding the relationship between alcohol and ice cream can elevate your dessert game. So, get creative, grab your favorite alcohol, and dive into the delicious world of soft and creamy ice cream!

-------------------------------------------------------

Cleaning your cat's ears is an essential part of their grooming routine that helps prevent infections and keeps them comfortable. Regular ear checks can also alert you to potential health issues. Below, we’ll outline a safe and effective step-by-step guide to cleaning your cat's ears, ensuring a positive experience for both you and your furry friend.

### What You’ll Need

- Cat ear cleaner solution (vet-recommended)
- Cotton balls or gauze pads
- Treats for rewarding your cat
- A soft towel
- A quiet space

### Step 1: Prepare the Space

Start by finding a quiet and comfortable space where you can focus on your cat without distractions. Lay down a soft towel to catch any mess, and gather all the supplies you need. It’s important to create an environment where both you and your cat feel at ease.

### Step 2: Familiarize Your Cat with the Process

Before you dive into cleaning your cat’s ears, it’s vital to make them comfortable. Spend a few minutes petting them and talking softly. Show them the supplies, especially the ear cleaner. Let them sniff the items so they don’t feel threatened.

### Step 3: Examine the Ears

Take a moment to look at your cat’s ears. Gently lift the ear flap and check for any dirt, wax buildup, or unusual discoloration. If you see a lot of brown wax or hear a smell, this might need a vet’s attention, but a little wax is normal.

### Step 4: Apply the Ear Cleaner

Once your cat feels relaxed, hold them in your lap or on a stable surface. Tilt their head slightly to the side so that the ear you’re cleaning is facing up. Follow these steps:

​ Got a Question About Your Pussy? Click Here for More Expert Advice --&gt; https://twocrazycatladies.com/cat-symptom-checker/ref/loganferret/   
- Gently squeeze the ear cleaner bottle to release a few drops into the ear canal. Make sure not to touch the tip of the bottle to your cat’s ear to prevent contamination.
- You should hear a squelching sound as the cleaner goes in. This means you’ve applied the solution correctly!

### Step 5: Massage the Base of the Ear

After applying the ear cleaner, gently massage the base of the ear for about 30 seconds. This action helps the cleaner break up any debris or wax. Your cat may shake their head during or after this step—this is perfectly normal and actually helps to dislodge any dirt.

### Step 6: Wipe the Ear Clean

Now it’s time to clean the ear. Using a cotton ball or gauze pad, wipe the visible part of the ear gently. Remember to be cautious and avoid deep cleaning into the ear canal, as this can cause damage. Always clean in the direction from the ear flap to the ear canal opening.

### Step 7: Reward Your Cat

As soon as you finish cleaning one ear, reward your cat with a treat and plenty of praise. This positive reinforcement helps them associate ear cleaning with a pleasant experience. If your cat seems really stressed, consider taking breaks and coming back to it later.

### Step 8: Repeat for the Other Ear

Once your cat is comfortable with the first ear, repeat the process for the other ear. Remember to stay calm and patient throughout to keep your cat relaxed. If your cat becomes too agitated, try again later or consult your vet for advice.

### Additional Tips

- Never use cotton swabs inside your cat’s ears, as they can push wax further in and damage delicate structures.
- Always consult your veterinarian before trying any new cleaning products, especially if your cat has existing ear conditions.
- Perform regular checks on your cat’s ears even if they don’t need cleaning to ensure no issues arise.

Proper ear care is an important aspect of your cat's health. With the right tools and techniques, you can keep your cat comfortable and maintain their well-being. Happy grooming!

Understanding the Importance of Regular Ear Care for Cats
---------------------------------------------------------

Keeping your cat's ears in good condition is an essential part of pet care that often gets overlooked. Regular ear care not only helps in maintaining your cat’s overall health but also prevents various ear-related issues. Your furry friend might not be able to tell you when something is wrong, so understanding how to take care of their ears is crucial.

Many cats can develop ear infections, mites, or wax buildup if their ears are neglected. By incorporating ear care into your regular grooming routine, you can help avoid these problems. Here are several points to consider about the importance of taking care of your cat's ears.

### Recognizing Problems Early

Checking your cat’s ears frequently can help you spot potential issues before they escalate. Some common signs that your cat may be experiencing ear problems include:

- Frequent scratching of the ears
- Head shaking or tilting
- Unpleasant odors coming from the ears
- Visible dirt or wax buildup
- Redness or swelling in the ear canal

If you notice any of these signs, it is essential to address them quickly. Early intervention often leads to a quicker recovery and less discomfort for your cat.

### Preventing Ear Infections

Regular ear cleaning can help prevent infections that are common in cats. Ear infections may result from bacteria or yeast and can cause pain, itching, and even hearing loss if left untreated. By cleaning your cat's ears, you minimize the risk of these infections significantly. Using a gentle, vet-approved ear cleaner can help keep their ears dry and free from irritants.

### Avoiding Ear Mites

Ear mites are another common issue that many cats face. These tiny parasites thrive in the ear canal and can be extremely uncomfortable for your pet. Regular ear cleaning can help you spot any signs of mites early on, like dark debris resembling coffee grounds. If you find evidence of ear mites, consult your veterinarian for treatment options.

### Promoting Overall Ear Health

Good ear hygiene promotes overall ear health, which is vital for your cat’s happiness and well-being. Regularly wiping out your cat’s ears helps reduce inflammation and keeps them free from irritants. This simple act can have a significant impact on their quality of life.

### Steps for Proper Ear Cleaning

To ensure that you are cleaning your cat’s ears safely, follow these steps:

​ Got a Question About Your Pussy? Click Here for More Expert Advice --&gt; https://twocrazycatladies.com/cat-symptom-checker/ref/loganferret/   
- Gather Supplies: You will need a vet-recommended ear cleaner, cotton balls, and treats for positive reinforcement.
- Choose a Comfortable Spot: Place your cat in a comfortable area where they feel safe. Keeping them relaxed is essential for a smooth ear cleaning process.
- Inspect the Ears: Before cleaning, take a moment to examine your cat’s ears. Look for any abnormalities like redness or excessive wax.
- Apply Ear Cleaner: Place a few drops of ear cleaner into the ear canal and gently massage the base of the ear to distribute the cleaner.
- Wipe Away Debris: Use a cotton ball to wipe out any excess solution and debris from the ear. Be cautious not to insert anything deep into the ear canal.
- Reward Your Cat: After cleaning, offer your cat a treat. Positive reinforcement helps make future ear cleanings easier.

### When to Consult Your Veterinarian

If your cat has persistent ear problems despite your cleaning efforts, consult your veterinarian. They can provide professional cleaning or treatment for underlying issues that may be causing the problem. Regular check-ups are also beneficial in assessing your cat's ear health and addressing any concerns before they turn serious.

Regular ear care for cats is vital to ensure they lead a healthy and happy life. By taking the time to inspect and clean your cat's ears, you can prevent potential health issues, promote comfort, and strengthen the bond you share with your furry companion. Your furry friend will appreciate the extra care, making ear cleaning a foundational routine for a healthy cat.

### Conclusion

Taking the time to clean your cat's ears safely is a vital part of responsible pet ownership. Regular ear care not only helps keep your feline friend comfortable but also ensures their overall health. By following the step-by-step guide we've explored, you can effectively remove dirt and wax build-up, reducing the risk of ear infections and other medical issues.

Understanding that your cat’s ears are sensitive and require gentle handling cannot be overstated. Regular checks—ideally once a month—allow you to catch any potential problems early, such as signs of inflammation or infection. The importance of maintaining clean ears extends beyond aesthetics; it contributes significantly to your cat's quality of life, allowing them to hear and express themselves without discomfort.

As you establish a routine ear cleaning practice, remember to use cat-safe products and techniques. Patience is key; your cat needs to feel safe and calm throughout the process. A positive experience during ear cleaning can make future sessions easier, allowing both you and your pet to bond over this care routine.

Started in Bangkok, done the south for a week then headed north right up to Chiang mai then done the usual pai, Chiang Rai route and absolutely fell in love with the north of Thailand. 

I flew from Chiang mai to Hanoi and was completely overwhelmed with how busy it was in the evening. I really enjoyed sightseeing during the day but not being a big drinker I couldn’t stand the crowded and loud bars in the old quarter. I travelled to Sapa to do some hiking then down to Ha long Bay, as beautiful as the scenery is in Vietnam and the food and the coffee was great I’ve just not felt as adventurous here as I did in Thailand. 

Has anyone else ever felt like this when leaving Thailand and with a lot of people saying they prefer the north of Vietnam to the south, should I maybe spend not as long in Vietnam and fast track the south into Cambodia to get back to Thailand quicker? Or does anyone have any recommendations as I head down south that would make me fall in love with Vietnam?

1j3wp3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j3wp3n/cried_so_hard_i_threw_up_today_but_proud_of_how/,cried so hard i threw up today (but proud of how well im coping),"currently a month out of a 3-year relationship and the grief is debilitating. it keeps hitting me in waves. i was starting to regain my sense of hope for my own future & this morning i woke up from a vivid dream where she came back and proposed to me and when i woke up alone i felt physically ill from grief, i cried so hard that i vomited (like the title says). but i’m proud of what i did after that point - instead of curling in on myself and imploding like a dying star i called my mom to talk about it, contacted my therapist to move up my next appointment, and made plans with friends for tomorrow evening. and damn if im not proud as hell of myself. 

i hate feeling this way but i keep reminding myself that processing my feelings is the only way to heal & that no matter how bad it feels, that it won’t last forever. and as easy as it is to romanticize the good parts of the relationship, the truth is that there were also more and more times towards the end that i felt hurt and lonely and unseen and misunderstood. and that’s not the way i want to feel with someone. so i’m working really, really hard to process my grief and move forward (and honestly im proud of how well im coping overall). 


in case it helps anyone this is what’s been getting me through: 

1. listening to my body - when i feel like i need to cry i do, when i need to not be alone with my feelings i call someone, and when i need comfort or to keep my mind occupied i engage with hobbies/interests, go on walks etc. its helping me keep from going too far in the direction of either wallowing or avoidance (balance is key). there’s a time to stop and feel and a time to move forward. 

2. intentionally creating moments of joy in each day. i start off a lot of days dancing in my living room, i’ve been going for walks in nature and watching the seasons change, i’m teaching myself guitar. those three things help me feel like i’m continuing to move forward.

3. leaning on my support system. for me personally i have a bad tendency to self-isolate - i also live in a new city across the country from all my closest friends and family, live alone, can’t drive and i work remotely so…. quadruple whammy. however ive found that calling up a close friend or family member when im really struggling helps me get perspective & feel less alone in my grief. today i went to a coffee shop to work for a couple of hours and while i was still deeply sad, it did take the edge off a little bit & im working on building closer friendships with the friends i do have in my city. connections and community are important!!

4. i made a distress cheat sheet for myself that i keep on my wall. it has a list of people i can reach out to, various coping skills that help me, and physical needs i can check in with. the part of my brain that thinks of those things short circuits when im in distress so having that already there to reference helps.

5.  writing letters to myself - both in moments im feeling good about things and in moments of pain. when im in a good spot, i write a comforting letter to a future version of me that is hurting. when im in pain i write a letter about what im feeling to a future version of me that is happy. it means a lot to have something i can read that’s coming from myself specifically when im in distress, and writing letters to future me is keeping me focused on my hopes and dreams for my future (and have faith that there is a version of me out there that is absolutely thriving). 

6. accepting it’s just going to be ugly and painful for a while. it just is. there’s no way around it, no way to circumvent it, the only way out is through. but eventually i will get to the other side. the only guarantee we get in life is the transience of all things, so while it means that we inevitably face loss, that the pain of loss passes too.

to anyone else reading this - you aren’t alone. all will heal with time.
