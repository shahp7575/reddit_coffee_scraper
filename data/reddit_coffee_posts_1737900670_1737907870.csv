I stopped at dunkin donuts on my way to walmart last night. It was to late for coffee but I was cold so I got a hot chocolate to keep me warm. While at walmart I was walking through the parking lot smoking a cigarette and sippin on my hot chocolate and a little old lady called me a bad mother and I was hurting my child before they were even born and that I didn't deserve to be a mother because I was smoking and drinking caffeine while pregnant. I started crying and told her to mind her own business because I'm not even pregnant. She called me a liar and said she hopes my baby dies. I got back in my car and went home.

1iai5ew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iai5ew,Are these cavities?,"I just went for a cleaning. The hygienist said I don‚Äôt have any cavities and he did my xray. The dentist came in for 30 seconds, didn‚Äôt ask me a question and said I have 4 cavities. The last time I went to another dentist (a year ago) she said I have no cavities and my mouth looks so good I only have to come in every 9 months for cleanings. I smoke and drink coffee daily. 

I was skeptical of this dentist then I saw a google review that said he told a woman she had 10 cavities for $1800. She went to another dentist for a second opinion and he said she had zero. I also had a feeling this guy was trying to scam me or money grab? Idk I got that vibe. But here are pictures of my molars (he said it‚Äôs all 4, the right one 47 is moderate and the other 3 are small).

Platform: Switch and PS5

Aspects: Action Combat and Turn Based

I love the Persona games even if i only played 3 reload but currently playing but im just thinking about what persona game should i get next. Persona 4 i heard has best Story and entertainment and looks like im gonna have a fun time with this one but the thing cant really decide if i should go for ps5 or switch for this one. Persona 5 royal heard it has best gameplay and story and feels like this is also the game im gonna have the most blast on but cant really decide if i should get it on ps5 or switch for this one as well and the thing is i saw some twist for this one and i dont know if im not gonna have fun with it but i mostly saw it from Vanilla and since Royal expands the story i think it should be ok but will i still have fun and see more twist if i saw some: - Joker getting shot by goro. - kamoshida speaking out on stage, Jokers coffee owner guy finding out hes a theif, and final boss (vanilla) dont know the true one. What do you guys think?

Another reason why i plan to get 5 royal first is because since the game is longer i feel like i just want it over with and thats another reason why i probably need to get it switch so it can be faster but dont know if i should get it on switch or ps5 (again) but still deciding if i should start with 4 or 5 first.",0,1737907217.0,JRPG,3,0.5,False

1iai4rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1iai4rb/1262025_new_starting_point_over_limitation/,1/26/2025 - New Starting point over limitation,"After writing my diary last night, I decided to get some feedback from Claude in the style of David Goggins. ChatGPT was too regulated to capture that raw edge and unique tone, but Claude, with its relaxed rules, was different. It was exactly what I needed, pointing out my shortcomings without unnecessary praise while still encouraging me to do more. We are all nothing, and we all lack something. Sure, some advice from seniors is spot on and I've learned from it, but that's not everything. No matter what happens, we have no choice but to toughen up. Instead of minimizing failure, I need to fail bigger and more often. After this feedback, I felt a stronger urge to read more financial statements, ending up with less than 5 hours of sleep.

I woke up before the alarm went off, and it felt like the day was testing me from the start. It was the most physically exhausting day in the past three months. My legs were weak from yesterday's run, and the soreness from a chest workout two days ago was peaking. I needed to do a shoulder workout, but my body was in a terrible state. Still, I got up. I stood there blankly for about 30 seconds to a minute because I was so out of it before I finally moved.

I got up at 6, quickly made breakfast, and showered. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, but my mind wasn't right, and I unnecessarily wasted time showering. I planned to wake my mom at 7 to go out together, so I prepped for development work until then. Normally, I'd waste that ambiguous time, but today was different. I started connecting Claude to the app. I had tried ChatGPT before, but this was my first time with Claude, so it was refreshing. I woke my mom at 7 and continued developing while she got ready.

We left at 7:30 and arrived at the gym around 8, but discovered it opened at 9 due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Bought coffee from the nearby cafe for my workout and spent the remaining hour reading. Once I shook off my anxiety, my reading speed definitely improved.

The workout was brutal as expected. During barbell shoulder presses, I exerted too much effort, nearly dropping the bar several times. Thankfully, the safety bar kept it secure. Even with such intensity, I didn't set a new personal record. I hit the target number of reps I'd aimed for in side lateral raises and increased the weight, ending with cable face pulls and a 20-minute run. Despite my legs being shot from yesterday's long-distance run and failing the shoulder press, I still ran. It was the right choice. I managed to run at a higher pace of 13 km/h instead of my usual 12 km/h even with my legs half-gone. Increasing my cadence definitely helped. Although my stomach lurched like it did during my previous 26 km run, I somehow steadied my breath and pushed through to the end.

After the workout, I went to meet my mentor. Although my anxiety was already resolved last night, my extreme personality made me want additional validation since we had already planned this meeting. Being with the person who initially got me started with real studying felt like coming full circle. We talked for an hour and a half, and my mentor seemed like a classy Korean version of all the famous people I admire. His perspective on life as an ongoing experiment and how it's natural for humans to be swayed by others‚Äô opinions but to tie up those influences neatly was incredible. I always feel acknowledged not as ‚Äòsomeone else‚Äô but as ‚Äòmyself.‚Äô

Back home, just as I was about to dive into my personal project, an urgent development task came up from work. I was hesitant because I had promised Claude that I would complete my project, but I had to finish it today, so I completed it in an hour. It felt a bit off, like I turned into a Doraemon solving any problem handed to me, but at least I got things done, knowing my mental state was far from normal.

Later, I resumed my development work, looping a 20-second motivational video non-stop for 3 and a half hours during the process. Pulling a section that had plagued me for a week to near QA levels in just 3 and a half hours was surprising. However, as the evening came, my focus waned, and I stopped 10 minutes before dinner because my concentration was shot. It felt horribly frustrating. Many say you should fill 8 hours, but I was exhausted after only 4 and a half.

Finished dinner in 10 minutes and started QA, where the real nightmare began. With each new error that popped up, I wondered, ‚ÄúWill this ever end?‚Äù I felt like a loser and that this was holding me back. For about 5 minutes, I just stared at it blankly before persuading myself with ‚Äújust once more,‚Äù working for another 2 and a half hours. Thanks to this, only the feedback feature remains, but since it's something new for me, studying is required. I ended up shifting from that task, studying financial statements, and started writing my diary.

While writing my diary, my mental state recovered. I hit limits and broke through constantly all day, but strangely enough, I‚Äôm not in a bad mood. Maybe this is what I was truly searching for. I always feel lacking compared to others, but just hitting continuously against it is okay. I can fail bigger. Now, it's time to get back to development work.",1,1737907206.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

Also buying a one touch nespresso, that was originally more for taste, but hey it‚Äôll simplify the process.

Pretty much get to serving ok but then points out how I‚Äôm struggling to get the eggs off the ‚Äúdrying plate‚Äù (you know when you take the egg out and it‚Äôs now dripping wet you want it drained before putting on the toast) and she doesn‚Äôt have a problem doing it, obviously that‚Äôs just a red flag to a bull at this point as I‚Äôm focusing on not fucking everything up (yes one side of toast is burnt but the other looks great). I must find a way to do this. I rely on my wife too much for food prep and since getting diagnosed and medicated, and therapy, I am more willing and do try to do more. I just get so frustrated at myself (and then dickishly that spills over to anyone trying to help). She agrees I‚Äôve really improved at it the house tasks and together we‚Äôve got that down (Finch to remind me and even I beat Finch to several tasks). I will add my wife went for adhd assessment but due to lack of supporting evidence from childhood (no available school reports and parents - wow I write that in the wrong priority order!). She‚Äôs considering a full childhood trauma assessment which may lead to a diagnosis.

So general tips for spotting and acknowledging that I‚Äôm loosing control and find ways to regroup before I‚Äôm a dick.

This week especially everyday I don‚Äôt text him while he‚Äôs at work cause I know he‚Äôs busy when he gets back from work he goes on a rant about his day and I talk about his day with him but he never bothers to ask about my day or how my week was and just says goodnight after we talk about it.  For Christmas I was alone and he knew I had nothing to do on that day and he didn‚Äôt invite me over once or do anything at all cause he was with his kids for half the day and Ive told him I‚Äôm not ready to meet his kids yet and he was with them only for half the day and I asked him what he did for the rest of the day and he said nothing. For Christmas I got him a present and when I came over on Boxing Day I gave it to him and he looked surprised and said to me I got ur present it‚Äôs coming in the mail and then next time I came over it was ‚Äú I had to get a refund it‚Äôs taking over 3 weeks to come ‚Äú and then it was I bought u the present but I left it at work and I know he‚Äôs didn‚Äôt get me anything. I‚Äôm not complaining about not getting a gift I‚Äôm not a materialistic girl that wants to be taken for dinner or showered in gifts and attention even if he got me socks for Christmas or just took me on a beach walk it would make me happy. I really don‚Äôt know what to do in this instance. One of the nights when I came over I told him I loved him and he didn‚Äôt say anything back to me at all and said it‚Äôs different for him and it takes him a little longer to get feelings like that for someone and I bursted out in tears cause I felt so humiliated and immediately regretted saying that at all and he then said I love u too then 
but I know it‚Äôs just cause I was crying, every other instance I‚Äôve said I love you he‚Äôs said it back but I know its just to protect my feelings and he doesn‚Äôt know anything else to say - I did ask him a few months later if he was actually in love with me and he said yes but he never says it on his own accord I‚Äôm always the one that has to say it first. This is the first relationship and my first guy I‚Äôve slept with and the ik age gap is pretty big I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wasting my time here and embarrassing myself or if I‚Äôm being too needy and want a fantasy relationship that‚Äôs never gonna happen if that makes sense idk I‚Äôm really stuck ",0,1737906256.0,dating_advice,10,0.5,False

I‚Äôm curious if anything similar has happened to you all.

So last year, I had a really long hypo episode that led into an insane mixed episode. The worst one I‚Äôve had since I‚Äôve been diagnosed/medicated‚ÄîI had to take a month off work because my brain just would not function.

Anyway, as this hypo episode was building up I was solo poly (don‚Äôt regret it, but no longer for me) and met this guy working at my local Kroger, where I‚Äôd stop for coffee before work. He was‚Ä¶fine. Not really my type, to be honest, but nice, and he made me laugh, and since he ran the floral department we used to talk about plants for ages, I‚Äôd even end up late to work because of it. 

He was 22. I was 30.

Anyway, we met in October, and were dating casually until about January, when my mixed episode kicked in. When I tell you I fell in LOVE with this man‚Ä¶ I spent over $150 on him at Valentine‚Äôs Day. I sat through him playing SO MANY video games I didn‚Äôt care about. I was at his house almost every day (and I am the fiercely independent type, so this was crazy for me). He had major surgery, and I was there when he went under and drove him home when it was said and done. I spent 2 weeks changing his bandages every night. I introduced him to all my friends, told everyone we were moving in together, stopped seeing my other poly partners. We were in the process of introducing our cats to each other when it hit me.

Suddenly, in April, I came back to reality. And realized I had no actual feelings for this man whatsoever.

He was SUCH A BABY. So fucking young, so emotionally immature, so‚Ä¶ mediocre. It was insane how in 2 months I went from planning a weeklong trip to meet this man‚Äôs entire family to having zero interest in him whatsoever.

I broke up with him in May. It was awful for both of us. He was devastated (I was his first real partner), I just felt relief. 

All of my friends told me in retrospect that they couldn‚Äôt believe I was with him. Everyone knew it was crazy except for me. But I felt so sure of it!! I was 100% convinced I was going to marry this man for months. Like how the fuck did that even happen?? I‚Äôm medicated, I journal, I know my symptoms, I even knew I was having a mixed episode and it still happened. It just blows my mind. I‚Äôve considered my bipolar to be fairly unobtrusive for years, and this happened and it completely shook my foundations. I hurt someone I cared about (or didn‚Äôt care about? I honestly still don‚Äôt know), and almost tanked my life committing to someone who would have been terrible for me.

Anyone have a similar story? Every time I think about it I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. I need to know I‚Äôm not the only one.",1,1737905970.0,bipolar,0,1.0,False

Reposting again - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 3 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

He's always had some difficulty pinpointing what he ultimately wants to do. He has a long history in the food service industry working in specialty coffee but heard of an opening at a local historical cemetery/arboretum (some prominent figures from American history are buried here....refraining from naming exactly who because it's too easy to figure out where he works/who he is by doing so), and took a position as a family services representative/planner about 3 years ago. It's a non-profit organization and he enjoys the historical aspect of his job. Moreso, he feels good about the ethical practices of his workplace and feels a genuine sense of fulfillment by helping grieving families. The transactional aspect of his job is something he does not enjoy, however, and that seems to be the piece that is preventing him from wanting to make this specific job a long-term career. 

I'm curious what thoughts folks out there may have about directions for him to consider. He's been pursuing his associate's degree in software development but is now questioning whether that's what he wants to do especially with the state of the economy currently. It seems like the deathcare industry offers more stability as well as more opportunities for personal fulfillment to him. He's only two classes away from finishing his degree, so I'm encouraging him to just finish it rather than have come this far only to stop short. But.....jobs that require further formal education are probably not realistic as at our age, he finds it nearly impossible to be able to manage full-time work plus school. There's also the financial aspect of returning to school that may not be doable for us.

He's expressed interest in becoming a death doula, but I'm concerned about the emotional impact that would have on him. He's someone who buries emotions until they spill over and I think this would lead to considerable compassion fatigue for him. What he'd really like to do is find some way to help advocate for people and help them understand how to prepare for passing, particularly elderly individuals. He says he frequently encounters people who just have no idea of their rights when it comes to this subject and he wants to find a way to better help them, which I think is really respectable. There has to be something out there for this, but we're not sure what. 

So...any ideas?

  
TL;DR: husband works in deathcare, wants to figure out a career path where he can help people understand their rights/family's rights and options as it relates to funeral/estate planning in an advocacy type of light vs a transactional type of light. What are some things to consider?

Background: 39 years old, 194 lbs 5'8,  Did P90X/Insanity/T25 on and off in the past.  Ideal target weight is 175-180lbs

I started P90X back in december with a couple of speed bumps - injured myself pretty bad for a week after doing yoga for the first time, and then there were just patches of days where i couldnt fit a workout in due to my work and parenting schedule.  I'm coming up on the rest week of the 2nd month and I see better definition, can do the moves much better and have gone up in weights and feel much better overall, but I've only lost about 3 or 4 lbs tops.  i went from 194 to around 190ish and that fluctuates throughout the day.

For most of my days, my meals have been as follows:

Coffee, 2 eggs in the morning with chicken sausage and sometimes toast

whey protein  and creatine shake with soy milk

Lunch is usually a salad that's heavy on beans and quinoa, along with either tuna salad, or leftovers from the night before

Dinner - we usually have a rotation of chicken, salmon, flounder, steak with vegetables and a carb.

I've cut out alcohol since before starting p90x completely

i feel like i'm definitely eating cleaner but not keeping count of my calories. (exceptions were a handful of days such as christmas, thanksgiving, and other family activities. but even then I kept most of my eating in check and kept it clean mostly and no alcohol)

I get around 6 hours of sleep on average.  I know it should be more.

I guess my question would be what can i do to maximize the results of the final 30 days of p90x?

should i start counting calories? any other obvious suggestions for actions that i'm missing??

Like yeah duh. So since then we just texted and nothing more.

Now, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, and I‚Äôve never flirted with a guy in my life.

**2) Warning: I haven't figured out the rules of reddit yet, so if I need to attach a link, I hope I can do it in the comments, without waiting for the post to be deleted by moderators or reddit filters (links to manga, various interviews and blogs**).

Yes, another post on this topic, perhaps you are already tired of listening to the same reasoning on the same topic, but in any case, let's discuss this aspect of the ending, but from both sides. If you did not know, Isayama was inspired by many works throughout the writing of the manga, in this post we will touch only on the manga called Himeanole. But unlike similar articles on this topic, for the first time in this topic we touch not only on the manga, but also on the film adaptation of this manga, filmed in 2016, and its features.

**Part 1 What is ""Himeanole""?**

Himeanoles can be divided into two parts, depending on which of the main characters is responsible for the actual plot of the chapter. One of them is an ordinary guy named Okida, he is kind of a shy person, he does not have many friends and does not have a girlfriend. This changes when he goes to a local coffee shop where he meets a woman named Yuki, who later becomes his girlfriend. There are various comedic and awkward moments in this part, most of which will belong to the secondary characters (Ando, ‚Äã‚ÄãOkada's teacher friend), but for us, the important one is the second main character, whose name is¬†**Morita**.

Morita is not normal. He is almost a psychopath. In fact, he has killed in the past and is prone to do so again (he killed a bully who bullied him in collaboration with his classmate). He also asks the classmate¬†**(Wagusi)**¬†with whom he killed the bully to send him money on a regular basis, while not working for 7 years and spending the money on a pachinko machine. But still, his storyline starts, oddly enough, as a minor character whose goal is to help his ""friend"" kill a man for money (an insurance scam), unfortunately, the plan fails and the ""friend"" plans to escape because he is afraid of being arrested, but suddenly something unexpected happens and Morito just kills him.

Later, he calls his ""friend"" Wagusi (a classmate who helped him kill a bully from school) from whom he extorts money and asks him to help him with the body of the murdered man (he doesn't know about the murders), which leads to this dialogue.

**""Chapter 22""**¬†(Warning: possible translation errors)

(Wagusi: Hey, ...don't you fee any guilt?

Wagusi: Haven't you ever imagined the sadness of those who die and the people around them?

**Wagusi: Do you really think it's ŒøŒ∫Œ±œÖ œÑŒø go that far just for pleasure?**

**Wagusi: Even if there's someone similar to you... that person might be enduring it rationally for their whole life**

**Wagusi: You talk about being unlucky... ...about feeling sorry for yourself, as if it's all just inevitable.**

**Wagusi: But that's the same as saying you're just like a rapist or an arsonist.**

Morita: Guilt, yes... I never thought about it... But inside me there's always a feeling of striving forward, as if I'm constantly flying towards danger.

Morita: You're only holding on because you can handle it, right? that's why i'm already... done with it..¬†

Morita: I remember a moment in middle school when i thought,¬†**'was i just born to kill people?**' it really gave me chills.

Morita: since that day, something feels like... i'm living half in a dream. i have no sense of reality. every day, what am i doing? it's completely uninteresting...)

And yes, he doesn't seem to feel any self-loathing or pity for other people, he also directly states his main goal (to kill Yuki and torture her) several times throughout the manga and his number one goal never changes. Later on, the plot switches from killing Yuki to killing Okade when Morito finds out that they are dating and that Okade can become a ""threat"" (my understanding) and tries to get rid of him, he even hires a homeless man who has a driver's license to help him if Wagusi can't (while lying that he wants to teach Okade a lesson as a bad person who insults his ""girlfriend"" Yuki). However, this event becomes the last straw for Wagusi, he plans to turn himself in to the police to stop Morito and his future murders, but his girlfriend suggests to just kill him and he agrees to it, unfortunately, the plan fails and they die at the hands of Morito.

Now Morito uses a homeless man to dispose of the bodies (while threatening him that if he doesn't help, he'll kill him) and burns down his house to delay the police in their investigation of missing people (people die as a result of the arson). After this, several more bad things happen to him (the murder of a woman with cancer who sheltered him, the murder of a policeman after which Morito gets a weapon, the murder of Yuki's neighbor in an attempt to carry out his plan, as well as the man who investigated his case and warned Okada, causing Yuki and Okada to flee the city). In the end, in an attempt to achieve his goals, he killed 7 people and lost everything he had, but never got to Yuki, for the first time he starts thinking about himself and others, and ends up in the hands of the police (knowing that he faces the death penalty).

**Part 2. Those Were Not Human Eyes.**

Honestly, there's a lot to say about the adaptation, but we'll focus on the last 20 minutes of this movie, where things happen that weren't in the manga, and the first thing we'll touch on is the dialogue between Yuki and Okade in the hospital after Ando meets Morita (a completely original scene)

**(01:20:33-01:22:00)**

(Yuki: Mr. Ando will not die.

Okade: It's all because of what I did.

Yuki: What can I do?

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Okade: Of course it is.

Okade: Morita...came for me.

Yuki: It all started when we were dating.

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Okade: Me too...did something.

Yuki: What did you do?

Okade: The truth is...when we got to high school...

Okade: I became friends with Morita.

Okade: We liked the same games.

Okade: But when Morita...

**Okade: Kawashima mocked him...**

**Okade: I started keeping my distance.**

**Okade: Then Morita...stopped coming to school.**

Okade: And Kawashima...there was no one to intimidate and it became boring.

Okade: I forced Morita to go back to school.

Okade: I told him that Kawashima ready to apologize.

Okade: I lied to him.

**Okade: I brought Morita to school. I teamed up with the hooligans.**

**Okade: I looked at him with contempt.**

**Okade: I'll never forget how**

**Okade: He looked at me.**

**Okade: With despair.**

**Okade: He was dying. These were not human eyes.)**

And you got it right, in the 2016 movie we have a different Morito, unlike the original, where it is often said that he was like this from birth, in the movie he is just an ordinary guy who was broken and succumbed to the ""darkness of man"" and started killing. What is even more remarkable is the changed dynamics of the relationship between Okade and Morita, because in the movie they are more like friends than in the manga (**in the original they only had one dialogue at the beginning, and in the movie there are as many as 4**), although you can say that all these dialogues were added only for the sake of the ""final battle"" between school friends.

**Part 3 Eren and the Problems of an Idea**

So now we know that Isayama's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsomeone being ""born the way they are"" seems to mostly come from Himeanole, where Morita was never able to become a normal person who could live in society and knew there was always something wrong with him (except for the 2016 movie). Isayama hinted at this idea for Eren at various points in the story, most famously Chapter¬†**121**.

On its own, if you don't take 131 and 139 into account, this is just Eren stating that he would always fight for freedom and that he doesn't hesitate to be violent towards those who tried to rob him of his freedom. Pretty much in line with how most viewed Eren anyway, yes?

A guy who is naturally violent when it comes to his pursuit of freedom but also empathetic enough to care about those around him.

That would be the case, right? Sadly not. And here is where the influence of Himeanole arrives.

In Himeanole, the serial killer was severely bullied as a teenager, but also claims (by himself) that he was born ""different"" (but not in the 2016 film, this plot point is cut).

So what does this have to do with Eren?

He wished for it. He wanted it to happen.

In other words, 131 paints Eren as if he wanted to create the Rumble because he wanted to see the very world that was presented to him in Armina's book: In conclusion: Eren was born with a twisted desire for freedom, that freedom = flat earth (yes, as stupid as that may sound), and because of that, he committed the Rumble. He just wanted a clean surface and wanted to kill humanity because they were in his way.

The Himeanole check here is great. Morita, like Eren, wasn't born ""normal"" and he also had a sick and twisted desire. For his desires, it was to get pleasure by killing people. For Erena, it's a flat world that he wants to have and the only way to achieve that is to kill everyone.

So why doesn't it just work!!!

The difference between Himeanole and Attack on Titan is that the author of Himeanol portrayed Morita as a villain after his first kill. While you can feel sorry for him, it's hard to ever sympathize with him when you know he's doing it simply because he's an evil pervert who gets pleasure from these people.

Meanwhile, in Attack on Titan, Isayama wrote a ton of reasons why someone should root for Eren. Hell, we see Eren's mother get eaten (reveals he did it, thanks to 139 for that), which would make just about anyone angry. We see him become more calm and rational in Brawl, we see him get genuinely upset at what his father did. We also see Eren even give up his own life to save humanity in the Historia cave.

That doesn't fit a character who apparently just wants to flatten everything because of a random book. Hell, even Eren himself said that he FORGOT the dream he shared with Armin in Chapter 84.

131 wants to tell us that ever since he was a child, Eren has been inclined to see the Earth as flat and devoid of people, and yet in Chapter 84, Eren says that he has long forgotten about that dream and that it has been replaced by a desire for revenge.

He wasn't interested in the sea, he was interested in seeing these things without being bound by any restrictions.

But then the number 131 comes up, implying that ""**seeing this scenery**"" was what Eren had wanted all along, ever since he was a child. There's a reason why these two panels use the image of Eren as a child.

Suddenly, what he wants to achieve isn't the freedom he would get from killing his enemies, not recognizing the freedom of whatever he wants to think, but the view itself.

The implication is disturbing. In fact, even if the outside world was completely peaceful, Eren would still have caused the Rumble because he was disappointed that humanity even exists outside the walls (**131**).

So Eren wanted to do the Rumbling because he wanted a flattened world, he states so in 139, he states in 131 that he was disappointed that humanity still existed and that he wanted to wipe it all out. He also states that this is primarily because the world wasn't like the one in Armin's book.

But how does this fit with the same guy who himself previously stated that he forgot about this dream? How could something that Armina's book told him be taken to make him want to destroy the world?

Isayama couldn't answer any of these questions. He took only one part of Morito's character and ignored all the others or replaced them with something that was never part of his character. Morito is honest with himself, he knows what he wants and what he will do (get rid of any threat that could stop him from catching Yuki) for his dream, in the movies he almost achieved this goal, and we see what could have happened to Yuki. Morito deceived and killed people without having to pretend or justify his actions with heroic goals (not much effort in the movie) because most of the time he killed without remorse for his dream,¬†**this is how he was from the beginning to the penultimate chapter**.

And what's funny is that when his conscience woke up and asked about the dead, he again thought only about himself.

So yeah, Eren's character becomes messy because Isayama got too inspired by a work that was created too late and implemented it in a bad and rushed manner, which hardly makes any sense.

**TL;DR**

**The ending was messy and confusing, Isayama shouldn't have tried to force the ""born this way"" theme that he read about in Himeanole and also add new features that were not typical of the original and contradicted.**

**P.S.**

**Although it's also worth noting that the work ""Himeanole"" is surrounded by strange facts and if you know these facts, you can ask very strange questions.**",1,1737904994.0,CharacterRant,0,0.99,False

I tried to comfort her and listen to what she had to say to try and find a solution, and then I asked if she wanted to take a break to have some time to think, but she started crying saying that she was really scared of not having me in her life so at the end we didn't take a break or anything, we talked things through and came to the conclusion that maybe the stress of college was making her think things things like that.
She said that she was young and did not want to think about the future, that we were hanging out too much and that she needed more space to study and do things alone, but at the same time she clarified that she still wanted to be with me and spend time with me.
But now I feel weird and also kind of scared, I find it all so conflicting.

First day it was mild headaches and back pain, followed by a fatigue crash after about 4 or 5 hours from taking the Vyvanse. Day 2 the crash came after 4 hours again, this time it was worse, as was the back pain and headaches. Panadol did little to relieve that, but helped a little.

The longer the day went on, the angrier I was getting, I was unreasonably angry and didn't know why. I have a young family,  so I kept that inside and only let on that I was going through the physical pain.

I thought that I was going to have to stop the Medication, which was only making me more annoyed as I was hoping for Vyvanse specifically due to its appetite suppression as I believe I also have a binge eating disorder, and it was helping.

It wasn't till I went to work in the afternoon and had a coffee that I felt normal. The first time it happened I thought it was the panadol kicking in. I was about ready to give in on Vyvanse the next day when it happened again. I'd spent a few days trying to find out if this was normal, if maybe I'd just be able to get over this adjustment period of getting used to the medication, but from what I was finding, it was looking more like the medication wasn't for me. 

It wasn't till that afternoon at work, probably less then 30 minutes after having the coffee, I noticed everything returning to normal. Right away it clicked. I hadn't been drinking coffee at home because my machine had broken. I prefer machine over instant so I was just waiting till I went to work to have a coffee. I didn't think that it was that big of a deal.

I don't consider myself a huge coffee drinker, I have definitely gone without and not had any signs of withdrawal other then a little tiredness. But it turns out, the withdrawal combined with the Vyvanse, turned up the symptoms to 11. 

Now im drinking instant in the morning and everything is fine. I think down the line I'll try cut back, I'd rather not be that dependent on having a coffee if im going to have the medication, but I'll probably look at that when im a little more used to the Vyvanse itself.",2,1737904791.0,ausadhd,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm in the early stages of designing a loyalty app, and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! My goal is to keep the app simple and focused, and here‚Äôs the idea:

1. **Main Page:** You get a QR code you can quickly show to vendors to track visits. It‚Äôll also display your progress with different loyalty programs (e.g., how close you are to rewards). once you reach 7 visits, you get free coffee or meal.
2. **Points & Leaderboard Page:** See your total points, your current level (Silver, Gold, Platinum), and compare your progress on a leaderboard (if you‚Äôre into that).
3. **Mission Section (Optional):** This could include small challenges or tasks to earn extra points and keep things fun.

The app is aimed at helping users track their visits and points with different vendors while making the process smooth and user-friendly. For now, rewards and complex features are on hold‚ÄîI want to focus on the basics first.

Would this type of app be something you‚Äôd use? What features or changes would make it more appealing to you?

I‚Äôd love any feedback, suggestions, or even critiques. Thanks in advance! üòä",2,1737904420.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False
1iagyc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1iagyc3/passport_sis/,Passport sis‚Ä¶,"I (F 30) am from the UK, I am a Bi solicitor (lawyer), back in 2018 I was going to get engaged to my then boyfriend and I had expressed that I really wanted to go to south east and east Asia for our honeymoon‚Ä¶ in 2019 we broke up after our families met and we discovered some worrying lies (if you want to know more I can post about that).

During locked down in 2020 I decided why wait for a honeymoon and that I should just go myself or with friends. Now I love exploring local areas and unlike some western tourists think it‚Äôs important to learn the language and customs of a nation I visit, for example when I went to Paris I brushed up on some of my French from primary (elementary) school or learned some Chinese for when I went to China etc. 

I joined an app for language exchange and learning (no plug for the app!) I knew some things about certain Asian countries through media and previous visits but they had been short visits and usually resorts. My profile got a fair bit of attention because a lot of girls wanted to learn English with me and like me they were tired of being hounded by creeps who were more interested in dating than learning. 

I never date foreigners who don‚Äôt live in the same country as me. It‚Äôs a preference based on class of cultures and would never entertain a long distance relationship‚Ä¶ or so I thought. I was speaking to a few people, some I am still friends with today and was learning some Thai and Korean (I was obsessed with the K-Pop band BlackPink and had been to Bangkok before in 2012 and loved it).

In January 2021 I bonded really well with a young girl (19) at the time, she was very helpful in teaching me Thai, her English was very good (she studied English since middle school). We had a lot in common and I related to her when she talked about culture because though my parents and I were born in the UK, ethnically I am south Asian. 

After a few months of talking every day (I was working from home and she was at university but studying online). In Thai culture young people address their elders (if a few years older) as P, e.g. P‚ÄôSam and if someone is younger you would say Nong Sophia, regardless of gender. I said to her oh you can call me P‚ÄôSaleena, because I am like your big sister. 

She said no thanks and I was embarrassed thinking oh fudge did I over step and become way too familiar! So I apologised but she explained that she doesn‚Äôt see me as a sister, again I apologised because yeah I was maybe too forward but she then went on to explain that she doesn‚Äôt see me as a sister because she likes me and has feelings for me.

I panicked and kind of froze because I was like wth, I know I love hello kitty at my old age but I‚Äôm not a PDF file! So I explained after that she‚Äôs too young and I don‚Äôt do long distance‚Ä¶and she‚Äôs too young! Now I had never looked at her in that way, hell I didn‚Äôt even look at her profile pictures properly but I did think she was a pretty girl, like normal girls do, nothing sexual. I was a bit quiet and she asked me to forget what she said and if we could talk normally.

I agreed, not to have a big ego but I have been told that I am (unknowingly) a bit of friendly flirt. So I thought I should be more mindful when we talk and I did want to talk because well I missed her. Then May 2021, she turned 20 and had a big birthday celebration‚Ä¶she uploaded some pictures on IG and wow, like I said she was pretty but I started to see her differently‚Ä¶

So we started to talk a little different‚Ä¶I was intentionally flirty and then a few more months later we began a long distance relationship. As soon as covid restrictions were over, I flew out and met her in 2022, her family and friends and we had an amazing 3 weeks together. I returned back to my country and flew out again 2 more times in that year and then that became the norm, I would go Thailand 4 times a year and she would spent the summers of 2023 and 2024 in the UK. 

However, things have changed a little, she‚Äôs changed or maybe I have. She graduated and went on to do her masters which she has now completed. She comes from a well of family. Financially she‚Äôs more secure than me, however she wanted to work and build a career. I was completely supportive and looked for freelance opportunities for her (She studied digital marketing and international business, her parental grandparents have a fruit shipping company and maternal grandparents have a health company). She wanted to become independent.

She wasn‚Äôt so keen on the marketing aspect of her degree but she was very talented at it and in my opinion had a great mind for business but her family wouldn‚Äôt take her advice. She was struggling to find work and I would encourage her and give her advice. Every project she would start she wouldn‚Äôt see through, she tried creating an acne mask, then selling vintage clothes, then developing a health probiotic but again she wouldn‚Äôt see it through.

I did support her with some ventures, which I was happy to do, I know they were all real because I saw the processes, emails and bills not that I doubted her but some of friends did. It started to frustrate me that she wouldn‚Äôt see things through and was wasting her time (in my opinion) as I always worked since the age of 16.

Now I am technically disabled, I had using that term, physically I look ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but I have a autoimmune disorder that can impact my mobility and cognitive functions. I actually had the issues since 13 but I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until I was 25 after I had completed my second masters. I even went blind for a few months and had to walk with crutches for even longer. It didn‚Äôt stop me. Nor did a pandemic from encouraging me to travel (controversial but I did get the vaccines and I guess I got lucky because I didn‚Äôt get covid at all, I also don‚Äôt like being touched - unless it‚Äôs my immediate family and lover).

I am also responsible for my mother who has Parkinson‚Äôs and have a very rewarding but stressful job. While balancing those issues and ensuring I get my mum the proper help and support (I noticed a decline in my mothers mental health and kept telling my family she is not ok but they dismissed me and implied I was just a bit of cow - I am but not with my mother!). I had been struggling a lot and I felt unsupported from my partner. I felt like she didn‚Äôt care or understand me at times. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time but I had fallen into a depression. 

The depression was there for a while and the lack of support feeling, was also there. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she is very loving and so amazing with my mum every time they are together and even when they aren‚Äôt she checks up on her by texts and calls but I just felt like she was neglectful to me at times, in person too. My friends would say she‚Äôs young and sometimes inexperienced young people can seem selfish but again she would be amazing and attentive with her family and my mum or her friends but not so much with me at times. Sometimes I want to feel like a princess too! 

In September 2024 I snapped. During a video call, I shared mums test results and it confirmed she did have a big cognitive decline. I was telling her and crying at the relief of knowing that 1. I wasn‚Äôt crazy and 2. A bad daughter. But while I was telling her I could see she was distracted and I got frustrated and we began to argue. I asked her to relay what I said and she couldn‚Äôt.

Now I have a bit of a tempter in that I do yell‚Ä¶and curse, lots of F bombs etc, but I never speak with a raised tone or swear in front or with my partners or parents out of respect. What I do is I become wreck it Ralph. I break things or punch walls for relief when I am frustrated. Not health and to be honest I had not done stuff like that for many years‚Ä¶ but on that occasion I punched my laptop screen, we were talking on FaceTime on my phone. 

She screamed you punched me! I was even more annoyed and showed her I punched my laptop, but at the time I didn‚Äôt register that it was a violent reaction and something that would be very scary if she was in front of me never mind on face time. I didn‚Äôt like that she thought I would lay hands on her and that she missed the whole point about not being heard or understood. I said if that‚Äôs how she feels that I could hurt her then we should break up, she shouldn‚Äôt be around someone who would do that. Advice I‚Äôd give others.

She said that thinking back she doesn‚Äôt think that I could but at the time she felt that way. I said let‚Äôs take a few days and think about what we want and the issues we have been having and then discuss them. I asked her to consider three questions in Thai or English and we can take it from there.

Three Questions:
1. What‚Äôs bothering us?
2. Can we work through it?
3. Should we stay together?

The few days that followed were awful for me. She seemed fine, posting on social media like normal, this girl posts all her emotions online, genZ thing? But she seemed normal to me. The day of the call she was late because she wanted to go out to dinner with friends‚Ä¶ok whatever, maybe she wanted to talk it out with her friends like I did. 

She wasn‚Äôt prepared and couldn‚Äôt answer my questions in either language. For me it felt like a slap in the face. Little effort. So we broke up. It was hard we were imbedded so deeply into each others lives and families. The next month was awful but we did stay in touch as ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and I got help, professional help.

We kept in touch and she would be flirty but I would control myself, reminding myself she wouldn‚Äôt be this horny when I was physically with her (being a westerner, we are more sexual in relationships, Thais not so much, especially Thai lesbians, I know a few who just cuddle‚Ä¶I mean it‚Äôs good that there‚Äôs not a big focus on sex as the only form of intimacy but a long distance relationship come on!). Sometimes I wondered if it was a tactic because I never go back to exs‚Ä¶ for me an ex is and ex for a reason. 

Now we never did anything and nothing explicit was exchanged. In fact when we broke up I deleted everything because in my opinion when a relationship ends so does the consent you had at the time of any intimate pictures or videos. But I missed her and she was finally being supportive‚Ä¶but as one of my friends asked, how long would it last? 

So‚Ä¶ feeling like I was in a better head space and seeing some maturity (it sounds so condescending even as I type it) I thought she had maybe changed‚Ä¶ I asked her if we could try again, she said yes. We agreed that this would be the only time. If it doesn‚Äôt work we won‚Äôt try again or it would become toxic for us both. 

Now around the ‚Äúmaturing time‚Äù she got a great opportunity as an assistant manager for a condominium complex, she was keen on this as she wanted to work in advertising for real estate companies as she loved houses. I had a lot of holiday left and my doctor wanted me to take a break. The job I have is very hard and had I not gone to visit and help her move (stayed for 5 weeks) I perhaps wouldn‚Äôt have believed how busy she was but also how amazing she is and the role and problem solving‚Ä¶but what about our problems?

When we got back together we said we would take it slow and I said we don‚Äôt need to stay together and we can date and take out time. Well dates were difficult because her demanding job (previous manager was getting done for embezzlement and there were many issues to fix) or her roommate would be third wheeling with us (best friend from high school who also started working in that city). My first week there we went to see her family on the weekend, loved that because to me they are my family too, we also took a road trip for a day to another city and then the next day we met up with her friends and then drove back at 4am to go to her new city which happened to be on a bloody island. Yes, I drive in Thailand, I am used to it and have the relevant documents and insurance. Safety first! 

The second week was calmer, quieter, most I spent alone. 2 weeks in after speaking with my friends and family they asked me‚Ä¶ does she actually want you there? Or are you just a familiar face to help her during this big step in her life?

I asked myself that a lot too, the reason being that since I came to see her, we had only slept together once, it was good but just the once, again fine, we were taking it slow but it was the fact that she didn‚Äôt want to sleep over in the same bed for a cuddle. So with my birthday coming up I asked her 2 days before my birthday (the big 30) if we were ok if she wanted me here or not. 

Now during our trip back to her family and friends, I didn‚Äôt find out that when we broke up it was a difficult time for her too, having lost weight because she wasn‚Äôt eating and lots of crying. Something she never showed me herself‚Ä¶pride maybe? But when we had that frank talk she relayed her true feelings and expressed she was distraught as she felt she was thrown to the side and had no say in the matter and was scared incase the same thing happened again. She said she loved me but she was scared and that she had to rebuilt that trust again with me. Something she had said another night when we went out with her friends to a club she had a bit to drink‚Ä¶

There were tears but we spoke properly and I apologised for coming to that decision without her and for making her feel that way (she comes from a broken home and was raised by her grandparents because her parents checked out and got remarried and had other kids, so me ‚Äúthrowing her away‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the best thing to do, regardless of my own mental state and feelings, massive bunghole move on my part).

But for my birthday she did surprise me with everything I could have wanted from gifts, to a romantic dinner on the ocean. No birthday fun as we had both synced our monthly reds but there was lots of cuddles and kisses and I was happy. Now I was there to see her and she would work a lot but that‚Äôs fine I was supporting her but she would be so tired she wouldn‚Äôt want to do anything, just have dinner and go home, dinner with her roommate‚Ä¶ her reasoning was that she couldn‚Äôt ditch her roommate (her roommate had parents on the island and wouldn‚Äôt rarely leave the flat in the evening) I said ok well it would be nice if we could have more alone time because I‚Äôll be gone in 2 weeks‚Ä¶

So we agreed a few days we would have alone and the rest she could join us, that I felt was fair and she is a lovely friend, I like her. So again most nights she wouldn‚Äôt sleep with me even though we would go to the gym in the morning before she went to work but ok fine, and she would sleep early as we would go gym and then she would go to work, so I decided I would hang out myself. I knew the language and I had a car and I made friends from the local bar near my Airbnb.

When she found out that I had made friends at a bar (a normal bar where everyone knew I and a GF, not a GoGoBar) and that I had made friends with a few people at coffee shops where I would go, suddenly she wasn‚Äôt tired and started to sleep over with a few nights with more intimacy. 

She even flew back to the capital with me and I thought oh cool we can spend a few nights together alone as she was able to get some time off work but no we spent most the time seeing her friends and getting her iPad fixed. Fine whatever, win win situation, her friends I already knew and met before and she did need to fix her iPad. The last night physically together, she spent messing about with her reunited iPad and I got annoyed and said this is our last night together and rather than holding me your fixated on the iPad. She apologised but I didn‚Äôt want to be held after that.

I dropped her to the domestic airport as my flight was later in the night and we said our goodbyes. I said I know she‚Äôs working and we will find a way to give each other time but we need to be more considerate, she agreed. I stayed in Bangkok and met up with another friend, a Thai girl, now I met this friend online but I only met this friend because she had spoken to my GF a few times and they followed each other on IG. But my GF was jealous and would send sarky messages to ask if I was enjoying my date.

It wasn‚Äôt a date, the friend was straight and just a friend also I wasn‚Äôt feeling great and puked in front of her lol anyways I spent the day with her and it was nice that she took my advice during an impromptu photo shoot. I am a good photographer and yes this friend was very pretty but not my type. A friend can be just a friend. 

Since coming back we have struggled to make time for each other. Well she had. We have a 7 hour time difference so I stay awake so I could speak to her in the morning and wake up around 4/5am so I could speak to her at lunch. I would also use my lunch to speak with her so she didn‚Äôt need to stay up late to talk to me. She does get tired easily I think she is anaemic like my sister and it‚Äôs hot so people get tired in Thailand. 

This week the lunchtime calls to me from her stopped. Specially on one day she said she simply forgot as she went out with her roommate after work for dinner  and then went to the mall. She is a bit of a shopaholic and windowshoper. I was hurt and when I relayed it again she apologised like she always does. I said actions speak louder than words in that she might be sorry but it feels meaningless at times. 

Today, Sunday, I spread out my day so we could have sometime together. It was her full day off and we have a time difference so she would do her routine of laundry, cleaning, going to the beach to relax and then the sauna. We finally talked, mostly about some real estate stuff she asked advice about and then she was quiet and falling asleep so I just said go to bed your tired. It was 8pm Thai time. She says she loves me and cared about me but I feel like she loves me when it suits her and gives me time when it suits her.

Am I being unreasonable in my expectation, that we make time for each other and express a reasonable about of intimacy with each other (not sexual)? I‚Äôm still youngish, I am successful and I do have many people after my attention but I never entertain any of it. I believe in being loyal, but I keep thinking am I not enough or worth the effort? Or am I a typical passport bro/sis and expecting to be the centre of someone‚Äôs world?

After seeing all the hype on blind shakers following Lance Hedrick's last research program (let's call a cat a cat), I obviously wanted to try it on my shots. But man, no way I spend so much on a box. And if I can avoid an additional transfer coffee, all the better !

Here is what I came up with :
My ground coffee is already in the catch cup of my hand grinder (a J-max), and the preheating cap of my flair Pro 2 fits kinda well over it, and probably also over most catchcups (I also don't use the cap to preheat my pro2 group cause, let's be honest, it is a very annoying and inefficient way to preheat it).

So why not just close the cup with the cap and shake ? Well, that works actually fine for me ! So I thought it was worth sharing.

Hope it can give some ideas !

Regarding blind shaking in itself, it definitely has an impact on my extractions. All else equal, it lengthen my extraction time and changes the taste and texture as well. 
But I'm still experimenting and trying to adapt how I dial my shots in to take the shaking into account. I think I prefer my shots with shakingthan without, but not yet sure of it.

1iagtn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iagtn1/why_cant_i_move_past_it/,Why Can‚Äôt I Move Past it,"I feel like it‚Äôs kinda complicated but here it is. I(23m) dated this girl (22f) for just over a year and things were going great but the longer the relationship went on the more comfortable she was disrespecting and hurting me. She has adhd and had a few bad relationships but I always felt like her intentions weren‚Äôt malicious. I treated her so well and I was very considerate and patient, I wasn‚Äôt perfect but I think I was an amazing partner to her. I broke up with her because she stopped trying to fix the issues that were bothering me in the relationship which were a lack of communication, lack of understanding and lack of respect as a partner and every time I brought up an issue that bothered me she would get defensive and I‚Äôd have to back track what I‚Äôm saying so she wouldn‚Äôt feel attacked. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a bad person but she never considers how her words or actions can make other people feel. When we broke up she made a 30 day tik tok series and she disrespected me a lot in that and I found out that she Hooked up with someone else from it but a week later she came to pickup her stuff and told me that if there‚Äôs any sign another girl was at my house she‚Äôs leaving and she won‚Äôt tolerate any slander. She communicated to the internet instead of our personal problems that I was begging her to tell me and she doesn‚Äôt even realize how hypocritical the tik toks were. 


6 Months later of no contact I broke it because I found out she was talking to someone else. I know I broke up with her for valid reasons and I don‚Äôt regret it but it hurt thinking that I treated her so well and was so patient and understanding and tolerated so much disrespect she just replaced me and found someone else and she‚Äôs probably gonna change for that person. After I broke NC we went out for coffee and talked about our relationship and since I wasn‚Äôt truly ready to talk to her I didn‚Äôt say how I truly felt and didn‚Äôt argue her false narratives. She said we were incompatible and that bothers me so much. Then I tried to kiss her and she said she was over me but she said don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out again(Totally fair). 3 months later after I go to therapy and work out how I‚Äôm feeling I reach out and she basically doesn‚Äôt wanna see me again. 

I get that I broke up with her but it‚Äôs frustrating because I feel like not saying how I truly felt was a good idea because I think it rly would‚Äôve hurt her but now I‚Äôm very hurt because I feel like I always took the shit end of the stick for her and there‚Äôs a lot of things I didn‚Äôt get to say and I feel like if I said it the outcome would‚Äôve been different. I don‚Äôt want her back and never truly did but I guess I just want her to see the truth which is that though we may have been incompatible but she‚Äôs the reason we broke up and she wouldn‚Äôt even tolerate the way that she treated me. I‚Äôm also mad at myself for being so kind and considerate to someone that has shown me they won‚Äôt do the same and feel like I lost a lot of self respect by reaching out and feeding into her ego.

I got the lil sweet fruity flavour that everyone talks about as after taste, but imho nothing that marginal of a difference tbh to get me into the specifics of grandule sizes, bean type, brew type and various 100 parameters brewed coffee has.

Maybe I ordered from the wrong place, or the wrong coffee, or had to try irl rather than ordering in. I'm willing to try once again from the coffee places you guys mentioned, this time irl, let's see if I have any different opinion. Will update

I'm interested in trying to make some coffee cured coppa as my next experiment. 

Can I ask two questions:

  
1) When weighing out the cure, should I take in to account the weight of the coffee grounds? 

2) The last time I made Coppa I vacuum packed it for a period, the hung to cure for another period. I'm guessing that I should just mix the coffee with the cure and apply both as a rub at the start?

3) Any advice?

Medicine: gabapentin 150 mg

Health issues slight bad numbers in cholesterol and pre-diabetic

Healthy otherwise

Recently had spinal fusion done in October no complications 

No gallbladder 

Perfect blood pressure

2 flawless pregnancies 

ADHD and OCD 

Sleep apnea with CPAP machine used NIGHTLY for a year with my average ""occurrences"" being 1 - 2 events an hour according to the machine

5'1

206 pounds


I eat mostly protein and some veggies, I only drink water with a Dr pepper once in a blue moon (I literally only had 2 this month and 1 last month and NEVER before bed, it's usually int he afternoon), i do not drink coffee or other sugary/caffeinated drinks otherwise, I monitor the salt intake and sugar and I'm averaging the norm for a person, I don't add salt to what I cook, I mostly bake or use stove top with olive or canola oil 

I do not eat 2 hours before bed, I turn off electronics 2 hours before bed, I'll read a book or listen to music before bed, I burn about 600-800 calories a day with work and exercise 30 min 3 x a week at gym and 6k-12k steps at work, if my shift is earlier (4am) I move my times back but follow the same routine, and I'm not *overly* stressed. I go to bed at 10:30 every night. Ive tried 8pm to 7am, 9pm to 7am, 10:30am to 7am, and even 12am - 1am and nothing nothing works.

Usually, I have no problem *falling* asleep, but I cannot, CANNOT (my god it's horrible) *STAY* asleep. I've started having hallucinations. My memory is shot to heck. I'm exhausted all day. It doesn't matter if I take a nap, (which I don't do because they make me more tired or give me a headache) or ready for bedtime, and no matter what, after about 45 minutes, the wake cycle for me starts. And I'm talking every hour by the hour, I'm waking up because of vivid dreams, to turn over, or just waking up.

My mattress is comfortable and I've switched it plenty of times of different comfort levels, I have good pillows, I'll even use a weighted blanket and a pillow to box me i so i dont move in my sleep, or I'll sleep like a normal person in bed and STILL wake up. I average about 2-3 hours a night because when I finally stay asleep asleep, after the final wake up nonsense, my alarm is going off those few hours later.

This past week now I'm struggling to even fall asleep. My guess is my brain is not turning off like it should and I don't know why.

I've had two sleep studies done and I'm scheduled for my 3rd next month. My psychiatrist said she has prescribed me every medicine combination on this earth and they *DO NOT WORK* They only make me even more tired when I start my day because now I'm constantly waking up at night *and* have medicine making me tired.

I would list all the medicines I've tried but believe me, it's your entire sleep list. Sonata this point I've stopped.

So please, please, why can't I stay asleep??????

Edited to add I have been the perfect weight all of my life (110-135 poundsish) until I gave birth last year and since then couldn't shake off the weight. The sleep issues started long before my weight gain last year, sadly, so it's not obesity.

1iago9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmom/comments/1iago9g/preteenteen_visitation_norms/,Pre-Teen/Teen Visitation Norms,"Basics: DH and BM have never had a court ordered custody agreement. BM picked up and left DH when SD was 9 and SS was 7, moved 4 hours away and DH worked weekends so he would only get to see them when he could take off once a month. Driving them back to his apartment (he had to move out of house because she also hit him with a half his take home pay CS order) to spend the night and back the next day. 

When DH and I met we agreed that for him to see the kids more we would need to move closer to BM, this included taking my own bio son with us (away from his father‚Ä¶ I had to drive half way to make exchanges work EOWE for my son). We were only 15 minutes away from them after the move but BM kept making excuses: they had this activity after school, they were visiting with this friend, they had plans on the weekend, she would arrange directly with DH‚Äôs Mother (my JNMIL) to come pick up the kids and she lives 4 hours away!‚Ä¶Rather than letting us see them. When we did get them it was to drive them to their activities (sports, music lessons) while we waited for them, took them out to eat (which I would pay for), and then taken them home. On top of that they were completely ungrateful for everything, everything was compared to whatever their mom and her new husband did (vacations, tech, rules, expectations). DH does not put his foot down as he doesn‚Äôt want to push them away as they already hate him from listening to BM bad mouth since divorce. I met him 2 years after divorce yet they still do not look at me or talk to me, their dad has to prompt them for simple hellos. They make me feel like if I wasn‚Äôt around they would have a perfect relationship with him yet they don‚Äôt know how much I have sacrificed and how much effort I put in. I was constantly asking my husband ‚Äúdo you want to ask BM to see the kids this week?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for the vacation if you don‚Äôt have money to bring them‚Äù ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs their favorite foods so I can have them at the house‚Äù, etc etc.  Nothing changed, they still hated me, my husband was still in absolute depression over it, JNMIL would host every Christmas and try to make it like it was when their mother was still around, they would all just sit around a reminisce on the good old days of when they were just one happy family‚Ä¶. 

After a couple years of doing that I told my husband I needed to live closer to my Bio son‚Äôs father to make our exchanges easier. My bio son wanted to see his dad EWE and I thought it was fair. I put all my personal money into a new house half way between skids and we moved. Husband continued to work a job in skids hometown and would try to see them, they declined often. jNMIL would still make the drive to come pick them up and coordinating with BM, we still struggled with money with CS even though the order was way too much compared to what he was making after having To switch jobs with the first move, DH will never ask for adjustment. 

At the New Year DH laid down the law with JNMIL and now we will be coordinating their visits with her (hopefully). And skids come EOWE to our house to stay. The problem is we bought a fixer upper and theres one bathroom and two bedrooms upstairs and a downstairs that needs complete renovations. My son has to leave to stay at his dads so step kids now 12 and 14 have somewhere to sleep (bunk bed) and the bathroom situation is unbelievable. My SD (14) is autistic and she has very bad hygiene. She has a poor diet and takes massive shits in the toilet clogging it up and just leaves it, she bleeds all over sheets without telling me. My husband cleans it all up but I‚Äôm completely disgusted by it. She may be autistic but she‚Äôs not to that level‚Ä¶. Her mom just doesn‚Äôt parent her and hadn‚Äôt taught her basic life skills. I have tried to stay out of it but I‚Äôm to my wits end, I do not want them coming over, it‚Äôs very uncomfortable with me and the son as well in such a small house. I just hide in my bedroom but they stomp around and scream so I get forced out. 

So, those of you with older Skids‚Ä¶ when do they just start STAYING at their mother‚Äôs home and how can I get DH to just take them out to eat or something? Or are there other ideas of things they could do that doesn‚Äôt involve coming to my house? My husband says they ‚Äúlove visiting‚Äù and I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ they usually just sit on the couch and stare at their phones‚Ä¶ last year for Christmas I gave them 10 $20 gift cards to local coffee shops in their hometown so husband could take them out, none of them have been used. Out of ideas and feel like an AH. They still do not speak to me and I‚Äôve now decided to completely disengage, I‚Äôm over it. ",0,1737903739.0,Stepmom,3,0.5,False

1iagnsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ill-Homework3399/comments/1iagnsq/ladies_and_gentleman_we_are_now_introducing_a/,"Ladies and gentleman, we are now introducing a dead man here. May sh...he rest in peace(Ha Ha Ha! Get it? Peace?) 2","He reaches the dining table. ""That was good"" he says. ""Can you buy another sha... nah, don't bother. That bottle would last next three days.""

You see the lady massaging the slumped man's shoulders. 'Perfect good cop, bad cop situation!'.

""So here I am. Let's break down my situation, shall we? I am malnourished, underweight, weak, i don't know the weakness of nightmare creatures. I don't know how to conserve stamina. I cant hold a sword for shit if my life depends on it. I'd probably die if a nightmare creature as much as breathes in my general direction and you know it. Can you ask the maid to bring two more cups of coffee. On second thought, make it three"" The maid looks flustered at being singled out like this. The man audibly pops a vein. 'I almost pushed too far'. 'Now he just has to bang the table or something and I'll recoil in horror. Yes, perfect ""Victim of child abuse"" strategy. That should garner some sympathy. '

He calms down. The universe must hate me. He just sighs looking at me in pity. 'Aigoo. I feel ya man. I mean, how was I supposed to know that there would be a day i have to rely on my brawns rather than looks to survive.'

The woman starts ""Ok lets start with basics. We'll teach you about basic combat weapon handling"". Sharp and as useful as a marble in a tool shed, isn't she?

i looked at her incredously, pointed at my arms and said ""There is no point. If there is a way to help me, teach me ways to identify poisonous plants, weakness of nightmare creatures, how to create fire, dig trenches, and if possible, redirecting a river to a different location. I f i am lucky, who

knows? I might just drown a pitiful nightmare creature or two in the river. I heard that there is a way to attract lightning. I can have fried fish my electrocuting a river right?""

The woman, to her credit looks embarrassed, while the man looks at me thoughtfully, considering my words. He replies ""It takes too long to drown nightmare creatures in water"". ""It will make enough noise to attract a creature or two that don't consider me as neither a threat nor food, right? I can escape then.""

The man looks at you strangely. You add ""Yes, I need to learn to handle blades and daggers. A light armor made of wool or skin of a nightmare creature would lower the rate of stamina consumption, right?""

The man nods. The woman gives a look of understanding.

Sunless says ""I'd rather you teach me to balance on uneven terrain, and also teach me to track footprints.""

Now the man looks satisfied. The woman just nods and smiles at me, gently? mockingly? Nah, its definitely gently. She isn't forcing her smile. Her hand on her husband's shoulder isn't digging into him, or is she just such a good actor? Ah, nevermind!

The man says ""Alright, we'll start tomorrow. You need good rest tonight. We cant have you tired.""

You just nod and start moving to the bedroom. ""Sunless"" the woman calls you. You look at her. She looks a bit flustered but stretches her arms out .

What is she trying now? She walks towards me slowly. Fuck, is she that angry because of that shampoo bottle. Wait, is she an awakened or ascended? Did she read my mind? Did she hear that comment? Your body is already in flight mode, you are just searching for a gap to run. She must have seen your eyes dart around in panic, who am I kidding? Yep, definitely read my mind. Maybe because she doesn't like me? She will just stop at just asking me to go back and never come here again, right? Lady, please don't harm my face. It's my source of income. You just close your eyes in resignation. Maybe she wont hurt you much, right? RIGHT? People like to see others with their heads hanging down. You do just that. You physically recoil when you feel her hands close around your shoulders and back, blocking every route of escape. You try to stop trembling only after realizing that she was merely hugging you. Oh. What a rookie mistake. What do people do in this situation, hug back? No, too personal. I'll close the distance, right, i am nearly weightless. It will look natural.

You lean in, looking at her husband in bewilderment. Wait, isn't it better to act like a ""tsundere"" in this situation? Before you make a decision, she pulls away, and just pats your hair. Oh that kind of incident. Predictably, she brings her head towards me and plants a kiss on my forehead and wishes me goodnight.

You just shrug. 'Ah, i suppose I missed this, after all it's been months since that cashcow of a widow who mistook me for her daughter died' You just grumble internally. 'She literally mistook you for a girl, and you miss her? tsktsk. Well, I suppose if not for her money, I couldn't have hired a PI to find my sister. So her death is for the greater good. You will be remembered, old lady' You felt as if you were stabbed through your heart and the blade is twisted in you. You just decide to be truthful to yourself, for once, just this once. 'Thank you Grandma. I am sorry that you had to spend your last days with someone as miserly, selfish and manipulative as me. You could have chosen anyone to replace your daughter, but you chose me of all people.' Welp, time to do what I can here.

""Thanks"", you smile brightly(Man, i'd give models a run for their money!)

You go to your room, with the thermosteel bottle of coffee. For the night. Sweet enough, i guess.

You just tsk. How boring! You look at the phone the woman gave you. Well, atleast this might be good.

You play some games on it. Man, I really need my beauty sleep, don't I?",1,1737903708.0,u_Ill-Homework3399,0,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:¬†\

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

1iagl91,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyGlamandRP/comments/1iagl91/f4m_bollywood_fanfiction/,[F4M] Bollywood Fan-Fiction,"I love doing erotic fan-fiction especially within Bollywood films . This can be any TV show or movie.

For example, imagine doing a¬†cheating roleplay¬†with characters from¬†Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi‚Äôs acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It‚Äôs shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj‚Äôs wife. It‚Äôs a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya‚Äôs girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother‚Äôs old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film‚Ä¶

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi‚Äôs hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya‚Äôs back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi‚Äôs chest a couple of times. He wanted more‚Ä¶

I'm 20f, 4ft 11in tall, and have been working at my local Walmart for about 5 months now. Undiagnosed but I know I'm not neurotypical and it affects my attention span and motivation. I'm a stocker working the graveyard shift, doing 40 hours in 4 days.

Now, for the thing that's been eating me up. I'm pretty good at doing my normal sections (infants, HBA, and cosmetics), however, there is one aisle that always ruins my shift. Aisle 6 and 7, it's all coffee, canned meats, and teas (Just clarifying because I don't know if all Walmarts have the same layouts). I ALWAYS struggle to stock aisle 6 and 7, it's my curse. Maybe it's because I can't reach everything higher up without a ladder, maybe it's personal stuff, who knows, sometimes even I don't. I can never meet the expected timeframe for that aisle, and it makes me feel like shit. I know it is partially my fault, but sometimes I just wish they would avoid putting me in that aisle. I really just wanted to post this because I got done with my shift this morning, and during work one of the coaches got mad at me for not being faster and gave me a talking to as I stood in the aisle.

Before anyone says to ""just quit"", there are other job opportunities around me, and I'm not tight on cash, but I stay because of personal and complex family reasons. Quiting isn't something I can do just yet.

Delonghi 885,

I have tried 2 types of coffee beans that are local to me. One was a Brazilian medium roast said to have chocolate, caramel, and nuts notes roasted on 23/01/2025, and an Ethiopian medium roast as well with mango, lavender, and strawberry notes roasted on 21/01/2025. Both bags were used today, 26/01/2025.

with both, I used a 15-gram dose with a ratio of 1:2 in roughly 25-30 secs, but no matter how much I increased extraction to get rid of the sour flavor it remained. The only thing that changed was the addition of a bitter flavor at the end and if I under-extracted to get rid of the bitterness it would become sour and a bit salty. but I'm not getting much of the coffee flavor that I'm used to. it just seems more like an ambiguous black liquid that is either sour and/or salty and/or bitter, the only good thing is the texture is creamy and for lack of a better term(that I can think of) syrupy (but not thick it's like watery syrup).

things that I'm not sure could be the issue are puck prep, I use the wdt to distribute the grounds and then I tamp firmly till I don't feel it shifting anymore.
temperature of the water is at the hotest that deloghni uses(i tried playing with it but i didn't notice much of a flavor change)
I'm also worried I have never truly tasted a balanced espresso and maybe what I'm getting is ""Good"" but I just don't like it, I imagine it to be a bit sweeter and nutty and tastes like coffee smells rather than what I'm getting.

I'm worried I wasted all this money on the equipment and beans trying to dial in, and that I don't quite have the skill required to make it work.

Summary: I recently got some money and I impulsively want to spend it, but feel a lot of guilt over it. This is paralysing me and I can‚Äôt get out of bed.

Hi, I have a little problem. I recently got a huge amount of money (for me huge, not ‚Äúbuy a car‚Äù huge) I did not expect.

Since I didn‚Äôt expect it, it‚Äôs not really needed for everyday bills or budget. I managed to put a third of it in a savings account BUT my impulse buying senses are going absolutely crazy.

Every couple of hours I‚Äôll go on some random app, put things I‚Äôve wanted for a long time from my wishlist into my basket and then almost press buy for another couple of hours before I start to feel guilty and frustrated and end up not buying it.

The thing is, I only shop from my wishlists. My wishlists are products where I always said I wanted them, and would buy them when I had a little financial cushion. Which I now have. But on the other hand, I really should save this money bc before I got it I didn‚Äôt even know how I was gonna last until the end of the month lol

I tried the old ‚Äúwait a couple hours and see if you still want it‚Äù trick, but the thing is, every product I want to buy was already carefully selected before I put it in my list. I know I want it, but I still feel guilty (because I‚Äôm still in that ‚Äúoh no how am I gonna pay my rent‚Äù mindset)

This whole game of wanting to treat myself, allowing myself to finally put the things I want in my basket and then starting to feel guilty and overthink everything has paralysed me. 

I‚Äôve been playing this game for two days. I can not get out of bed. I can‚Äôt do anything except overthink this whole thing and trying to hold myself back from placing a thousand orders. My whole apartment is disgusting (it was before, but I initially planned to have coffee with a friend today so I would be motivated to clean but instead cancelled on her), and it‚Äôs starting to affect everything. I haven‚Äôt eaten, I‚Äôm lying next to trash and the only thing I want to do is place this order for some luxury makeup (now that‚Äôs ironic isn‚Äôt it).

Did anyone ever experience this? How did you deal with it? How do you stop focusing on the money and get back into real life? How do you stop yourself from impulsively spending the money?",1,1737902353.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False
1iag3zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1iag3zz/a_typical_sunday_morning_after_drinking_the_night/,A typical Sunday morning after drinking the night before v. a Sunday 4 weeks into going sober,"
A Sunday morning after a night of (always heavy) drinking typically would go like this:

7:30 alarm-wake up from completely passed out, somehow still feeling sleepy, cloudy, and completely awful. Go downstairs to feed the cats on autopilot. Head hurts, but maybe I can stave off the hangover today if I drink a few sips of water, which I desperately need. Go back to bed to try to sleep more. While there, I can't really fall back asleep but I am still tired enough to need to lay in bed with my eyes closed. Eventually fall back asleep for 15 minutes until

9:00 alarm--feed cats a second time. Force myself to stay away this time cause I am an adult, not a teenager, and I feel guilty going back to bed again. Chug water as I'm making coffee (my mouth is so dry but it doesn't feel good and maybe it's making me feel nauseous). As the coffee water boils, think about how much I wish I would stop drinking. Promise myself I won't drink tonight. Get a bit serious about it. Pour some coffee but it bothers my stomach and makes me more sleepy. Eat a couple handfuls of cereal and sit on the couch to plan my day. Feel drowsy and cloudy and close my eyes for a bit. Sit in a state of half asleep, half awake for several hours, doing nothing. Force myself to stop sleeping around 11:50 and start my day, cobbling together some motivation and energy, though I have very little mental energy to do anything creative/intellectually stimulating and very little physical energy to do exercise.

A Sunday morning 4 weeks after going sober:

7:30--wake up feeling a little sleepy, but well rested. I had complete dreams and deep sleep. Go downstairs to feed the cats. Decide I don't feel a pressing urge to go back to bed, so I make coffee and some healthy pancakes out of oats, bananas, and eggs. Listen to a podcast as I do it. Remind myself I should drink water along with my coffee, but don't feel desperate or dehydrated. I'll get to drinking water today. Sit down and think about how I want to spend my day, what's important to me to do, what I need to do, etc. Get distracted by reddit for a while, and then come back to what I was doing. Yes, I got distracted but it is still so early. I have so much time.

9:00-feed the cats, watch them zoomie, take a few minutes out of my day to write this post as a reminder to myself.






I used to read posts on this subreddit where people would talk about how 'productive' they were, and I would feel a bit like 'I don't want to be like that, I don't want to just be a good human cog.' There was this part of me that felt like alcohol was the thing I chose myself, that I accepted the consequences of feeling a little destructive for the freedom/control to do something I chose, for that agency. But sitting around for hours with my eyes closed, immoble with sickness and anxiety isn't really agency, is it?

Are you dreaming of a stylish and cozy living room that‚Äôs both functional and aesthetically pleasing? Look no further than [Scandinavian living room ideas](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/scandinavian-living-room-ideas/)! 

The beauty of Scandinavian design lies in its minimalist approach, using clean lines, natural materials, and light colors to create a calm, inviting space. Whether you‚Äôre working with a small apartment or a spacious home, Scandinavian style can be easily adapted to fit your needs.

One of the key elements of Scandinavian living room design is the focus on natural light. Opt for light-colored walls and large windows to let in as much natural light as possible. 

Wooden furniture and floors add warmth and texture, while soft textiles like wool and linen provide comfort without overwhelming the space. Adding plants is another Scandinavian touch that brings nature indoors.

To complete your Scandinavian living room, incorporate functional yet stylish furniture pieces. Think sleek coffee tables, cozy armchairs, and simple shelving units. Keeping the space clutter-free is essential to achieving that Scandinavian vibe.

1iag0ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1iag0ql/9_years_lpr_following_cold/,9 years LPR following cold,"Hey guys.

Hiatal Hernia my whole life, 2cm, no GERD, no stomach inflammation, pH test did not show any reflux (just regular reflux like everyone on the planet has according to my doctor, meaning any type of surgery is not possible for me).

Always been hard to pin-point triggers due to how constant symptoms are but the usual ones like Coffee, mint and such that relax the LES make symptoms worse.

Here are my symptoms (they're constant, everyday and no relief EVER post viral flu):

Chronic Heart palpitations (Hyperactive vagus nerve?)
Chronic Rhinitis (Rhinitis is closely linked to Vagus Nerve issues)
Post nasal drip
Tight throat feeling, sometimes random, mostly during/after meals
Itchy ears, mostly right side
Thick saliva that needs to be spit out a lot sometimes

Used to have but they went away after 6 months of high dose PPI and strict diet but lost way too much weight:
Chronic cough
White tongue at the back (not candida)
Throat clearing all the time (it drove me crazy, absolutely insane)
and more that I cannot remember

I cannot lie, after all these years, being only 28 years old and hanging out with friends seeing them being happy with no health issues, I am having more and more depressive episodes, alongside having Aspergers it's not an easy life. I'm not saying that I have it worse than anyone else, that I know for a fact and there are way worse conditions out there, how's it going for you guys?

I also live in Sweden and doctors from my experience here will gaslight you if you bring up LPR as they don't believe in it or if you try to explain anything about Pepsin to them they will just ignore you and say that there's nothing for them to do for you, and especially since nothing unusual is shown on pH monitoring.

I have also bought and tried all the available alginates over the years, several times, for weeks to months. I bought a bed that can be folded upwards and use it everyday, sleeping on the left side, not eating before bed (3 hours minimum) no effect on the current symptoms regardless for how many months I keep it up.",1,1737902089.0,LPR,3,1.0,False

The light from the lamppost caused an almost spectral glow as he looked for any signs of movement from the building opposite. The light from behind the curtain revealed no clues as to the occupant‚Äôs whereabouts and he took one last drag of his cigarette before flicking it into the gutter.

‚ÄúToo much like the fucking *Exorcist* for my liking‚Äù he muttered to himself as he hid in the shadows, raising the collar of his leather jacket and instinctively rubbing at the scar on his right cheek before putting his hands in his pockets to temporarily keep out the damp evening chill. This kind of weather always played havoc with his muscles and bones, the result of past injuries not fully healing.

He reached into the back pocket of his Levis, removed his phone and put it in the inside pocket of his jacket, along with his silver hip flask. He took the flask out, unscrewed the top and took a large swig of Jack Daniels before replacing the lid.

‚ÄúTime to move‚Äù he said to himself, taking once last glance up at the lit window as he returned the hip flask to the other inside pocket and leaving the alley.

This should be a routine job, similar to countless previous ones he‚Äôd carried out in the past and it was a nice little earner. The job had come his way not via the usual route, but from an old Army buddy named Scotsy who had been approached by a rich Businessman in his local pub who had heard that he may be able to put him in touch with someone who dealt with such matters - namely, his spoiled teenage daughter had decided to quit her ¬£12,000 a term private school and embark on a downward spiral of fast living and self-destruction, ultimately ending up in a serious heroin addiction.¬† This in turn had led her to prostituting herself and eventually borrowing money in order to feed her increasingly dangerous habit. Within a few months she had been caught shoplifting on numerous occasions, overdosed twice, caught all manner of STDs and had ended up in thousands of pounds worth of debt through loans taken out with a nasty little loan shark known on the street as Ratweasel, a scrawny man with rodent like features who always paid others to do his dirty work. Unable to repay the loan due to constant borrowing and extortionate rates of interest, she had become Ratweasels personal slave to be used by him in any way he saw fit until he decided that her debt had been repaid. Her father, a rather shy and humble man, had approached Scotsy in despair and with an open cheque book, pleading to have his beloved daughter saved. The Police, he told Scotsy, were not an option due to the scandal it would cause. The plan was simple - gain entry to the flat, rough up the weasel and tell him in no uncertain terms that this was all over for him. Most importantly get the girl out.

As he moved across the small cobbled street from the alley he could hear thumping music coming from the general direction of the window. He paused at the ground floor entrance door and pulled out his lock picking kit and got to work. He gained easy entry through the door, a combination of Army skills learned and the fact that Ratweasel was so arrogant he felt that he only required minimal security, believing himself to be untouchable.

Finn silently entered the dimly lit foyer and peered up the stairs. The music was louder on the inside and the distinctive smell of weed wafted down from the upper level. He climbed the stairs and reached a second door on the landing, this one slightly more secure than the lower one. Gaining entry through the second door, he entered a dirty apartment hallway. Light was coming through the open door at the end of the corridor to the right, which seemed to be where the music and weed smell were pumping out from. He could hear voices and then a sudden burst of laughter through the noise as he made his way up the hallway. A bedroom door to the left was open and as he peered through he noticed a teenage girl of about fifteen lying on her side on a filthy blood stained mattress. Her soiled clothes were ragged and torn, her mouth and hands were gagged and tears were running down her cut and bruised face. She looked up and noticed him in the doorway, her eyes widening as a look of sheer panic and fear rose on her damaged face. She tried desperately to release her hands and feet from the cable ties bonding them and gagged through the duct tape covering her mouth which suppressed her screams. A bubble of snot had formed in a nostril and more tears streamed down her face. Quinn saw track marks on her arms and noticed through her torn top a huge bite mark on her right shoulder. He raised an index finger to his lips in a ssshing gesture and silently mouthed the words ‚Äúhow many?‚Äù, whilst tipping his head in a sideways motion towards the other room. This seemed to pacify her somewhat, and she raised four digits on one of her bound hands. Finn made the OK sign and held out his hands in a palms down motion, encouraging her to stay calm. More laughter could be heard from the other room. He carried on along the corridor and neared the open doorway.

¬†‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fucking do this‚Äù, he whispered to himself.

¬†Rounding the door, he saw a stick thin man with a dirty ponytail sitting on a sofa with his back to him. A waft of smoke rose around his head as he took a huge drag of a joint. Two other men were sitting in front a TV in the corner of the room playing a shooting game on an X Box and laughing. The loud music drowned out the machine gun fire coming from the TV. The larger of the two, a bald headed, thick set man with tattoos covering his forearms, turned and punched his smaller Arabic looking colleague squarely on the shoulder.

‚ÄúOw, you fucking fuck!‚Äù he protested, as he threw his console at the larger man, which hit him on the temple and bounced off with a dull thud.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in for it now fuck face!‚Äù said baldy, who leapt up and charged at his smaller counterpart, pinning on the floor in the process.

‚ÄúWill you pair of cunts just cut it out, you‚Äôre spoiling my buzz!‚Äù complained Ratweasel from the sofa. He leant forward and flicked the ash from his spliff onto the dirt stained carpet and turned the music down to a more civil level. The nails at the end of his long, bony fingers were crusted with grime but the gold sovereign rings he wore on each hand were surprisingly spotless.

‚ÄúSorry guv‚Äù, baldy said sheepishly

‚ÄúYeah sorry boss‚Äù, said Arab boy straight after.

It was then, as baldy was climbing off of Arab that he spotted Finn in the doorway and he leapt up in a flash, grabbing for the gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans. Finn took a step forward, pulled out his Taser, aimed, and fired, hitting baldy squarely in the chest. Baldy went down shuddering and landed back on Arab and Finn heard a crack of ribs as Baldy squirmed all over him. Spitting blood, Arab was curled up holding his mid-section and clearly out of action so Finn turned his attention to Ratweasel, who by now was off of the sofa, a look of surprise on his face, a Stanley Blade in one hand. He was hopping from foot to foot and his bathrobe had come loose.

‚ÄúThe fuck you want man?!‚Äù Said Ratweasel through gritted teeth. He was clearly agitated and he looked across to his goons, who were both still rolling around in agony.

‚ÄúI think there are a few things we need to discuss,‚Äù said Finn, closing in on his quarry, ‚Äúand there‚Äôs one of two ways this is gonna pan out. And we‚Äôre gonna start with you dropping that blade.‚Äù He took another step towards Ratweasel, who instinctively took a step back. He dropped the blade, swallowed hard and held his hands palms up.

‚ÄúJust take the money get the fuck out man, it‚Äôs in the safe, I‚Äôll give you the combination.‚Äù

Finn took one final step towards Ratweasel, punched him twice in the face and grabbed the front of his robe. He threw him across the room and he hit the wall, bounced off and landed face down on the glass coffee table, shattering it. He tried to sit up, his cheek scratched and robe blooded as shards of glass pierced through it. He smeared blood away from his mouth with the back of hand.

‚ÄúNow do I have your full attention?‚Äù said Finn, standing over the shattered coffee table. Ratweasel looked up at him. He was breathing heavily and spat blood onto the carpet.

‚ÄúSo, Mr Weasel, now that I have your undivided attention, I will explain the rules. I will tell you what you are going to do henceforth, and you will agree. If I am not happy with your responses, I will fuck you up. If you disagree, try to talk your way out of it or so much as protest, I will fuck you up. In fact, give me any kind of excuse and I will fuck you up. Are we totally clear?‚Äù

Ratweasel looked up at him, a look of defiance on his face. Finn stood over him and raised a fist.

‚ÄúAre we fucking clear on that?!‚Äù he shouted, and Ratweasel cowered away.

‚ÄúI get it, I get it! Just get on with it man, take what you want and leave me the fuck alone!‚Äù He peered across to Baldy, who was now recovering. He was on one knee and breathing heavily, a look of hatred on his face as he stared at Finn. Finn turned to look him, Tasered him again and returned his attention to Ratweasel.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking the girl with me, and when she leaves, you will not attempt to find her. Is that understood?‚Äù Ratweasel nodded.

‚ÄúYou will write off her debt, and you will forget that she ever existed. I will emphasise that if you ever, I repeat ever, come after her, I will come back and I *will* bury you. Capiche?‚Äù Ratweasel nodded again.

As he turned to leave he felt the full force of a blunt object hit him across the face. He went down and was suddenly set upon by the heavy set man who proceeded to rain down blow after blow onto the dazed Finn. He recovered quickly and got to one knee, but the heavy set man continued to rain down punches on him in a frantic manner. He suddenly felt a sharp stinging pain in his neck, put his hand to the pain and felt a dart like object in his skin. As he was realising this, the world seemed to swim in and out of his vision; he lost consciousness and collapsed face down on the floor.

1iafvpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iafvpo/beginner_dialing_in_lightmedium_roast_espresso/,Beginner Dialing in Light/Medium Roast Espresso [Breville Bambino Kingrinder K6],"I've recently dove into this rabbit hole and I've found some difficulty (as most do) in dialing in the right grind size (grind finer, I know friends I know) for lighter roast coffees. I'll start with my equipment and then go into the admin data if that works for everyone.

Equipment:
Breville Bambino
Kingrinder K6
IMS bottomless portafilter: B62.52TH24NT (14-18g basket)
Normcore Showerscreen (if that even matters?)

Administrative Data/Settings:
Beans: I've been using a locally roasted light/medium Honduran single origin recently to try something new. I really love Ethiopian but I've struggled to dial anything Ethiopian in and always find it's very sour. I'll save that for areopress or pour over. 

Grind size: my K6 has a 'true zero's -5 clicks past 0, which I'm not accounting for or including in my setting. I start at 0 and go to 33 clicks.

Dose: I tried running 18g but found the first drop was well past 15+ seconds and the total output was lower than expecting. I reduced by .5 and eventually 1.0g and landed on a 17g dose. 

Notes:
I've noticed the puck isn't soaking wet, but does leave a little standing water on the top of the puck/shower screen after pulling a shot. Making me think I'm slightly under dosing the basket. 

Given the lighter roast, I'm aiming for a 2.5-3 ratio. That is, 17g in, and 42.5-51g out. 

Results: typically with my 17g dose at 33 grind size I'm seeing first drips in 12-14s (is that a tad too long?) and the shot runs the full double shot time usually ending with ~40g out in approximately 43-44s. However, at the 42-44s mark the machine has just turned off and the espresso is just barely dripping from the bottom of the portafilter. 

Can anyone give me reassurance or advice on how to improve? If any additional information is needed please let me know and I will provide as much as I can.

If you‚Äôre looking to create a cozy, stylish, and [inviting living room](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/modern-rustic-living-room-ideas/), a modern rustic design could be the perfect choice! Combining the charm of rustic elements with sleek, contemporary touches, this trend creates a welcoming atmosphere that feels both warm and sophisticated. 

Think exposed wooden beams, natural stone accents, and plush textiles mixed with modern furniture, sleek lighting, and minimalist decor.

To start, consider incorporating a statement rustic coffee table made of reclaimed wood, paired with neutral-colored sofas that provide comfort without overpowering the space. 

Add texture with cozy throws, patterned pillows, and indoor plants to bring life to your room. Don‚Äôt forget about the lighting‚Äîindustrial-style fixtures like metal pendant lights can enhance the modern rustic vibe.

For a truly balanced design, blend vintage accents with fresh, modern pieces. Neutral tones like whites, grays, and warm browns create harmony while making the room feel spacious and inviting. 

Whether you‚Äôre working with a small space or a larger living room, modern rustic living rooms offer endless possibilities for creating a space that feels both relaxing and elegant.

1iafs0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1iafs0l/aio_friend_is_weird_and_hostile_about_my_new_bf/,AIO: Friend is weird and hostile about my new bf so I don‚Äôt bring him around anymore,"I (28f) recently got into a relationship with a really lovely guy. It‚Äôs just been a few months, but we‚Äôre totally in love, and it‚Äôs the best relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. I told my friends about a month in that I could see myself with him forever, and he feels the same way. He is great, and likes my friends, and I love to bring him around them and have everyone hang out. It‚Äôs not something I usually do (unhealthy relationships in the past) but with him, it‚Äôs just so easy. My best friend loves him. My other friends feel fondly about him, too. But I have one friend (26f) who has been acting really strangely.

For context: my friend has a history of being sort of ‚Äúanti-men,‚Äù which is a perspective that of course I understand (again, I haven‚Äôt had all good experiences with men, who has??) but not one that I support. But they often project and are reactionary, which I believe could be behind her behavior. One point I want to make: they've never been abused or sexually assaulted. Their problems with men, as far as they can say and as far as I can tell, come from the fact that their dad was absent their whole life. I also want to note that this person is autistic (undiagnosed) and maybe that has something to do with it. I really don't know. She's also never been in a relationship before and has admitted to previously having a crush on me, but said it passed quickly. 

The first time they met, he came to a club to meet me there. I was with a group of maybe 5 people. They met, shook hands, we talked a bit and smoked and went inside. The rest of the night was a lot of fun‚Äîmusic, dancing, drag. But the next day my friend told me, very very seriously, that they felt weird because her and my bf barely spoke. I explained that we were dancing, we didn‚Äôt even talk to each other, the music was too loud. She let it go.

The next time they met was at my house. The three of us were hanging out, getting a little stoned, smoking cigarettes, eating fruits. At one point one of the lighters broke. So I looked around for another one, and then my friend handed me one after about 3 seconds of me looking. I thought it was a good night, I had fun.

The next day my friend sent me a text, ‚ÄúAre you with ___?‚Äù I said no (I was). She then sent me a 10-minute voice note detailing all the things he did wrong. Apparently, when I was looking for the lighter, he had a lighter in his hands. My friend says it really ‚Äúsays a lot‚Äù that he didn‚Äôt immediately hand me the lighter when I was looking for it, and she suggested he did it on purpose because he wanted to watch me struggle. I was honestly shocked. If he knew I was searching for anything, he would help. To me, he obviously just didn‚Äôt realize that I was looking. I explained to her that we were stoned, he has a lower tolerance than us, it was late, and english is his second language. They said okay, but that I should just be aware of that and ""keep an eye out."" I didn't tell my boyfriend this because honestly it didn't make any sense to me. 

The next time they meet, a few weeks later, I brought him to her apartment. There was five of us. We had fun, smoked, ate fruits (I'm seeing the pattern here üòÇ) and we peft because I was tired and my friend talks a lot without stopping. 

The next day, I get a similar text, ""Are you with ___?‚Äù again I said no (I was). They again sent me voice notes, about 20 minutes worth. The preamble was basically, ""I really need to tell you something, because if my man did this I think I'd instantly leave him. It's fucking disgusting, and I just think it's important that you know.""

At this point I'm a bit scared- I mean, did he say something offensive? Did he hit on someone while I was turned away? My mind was going crazy!! 

So I keep listening. To my friend, the problem was this: he left an orange peel on the coffee table. He peeled an orange, and he left the peel on the table. I had to listen multiple times to understand if this really was the issue, and texted them to clarify. They said yes, and that it ""speaks to a pattern of behavior"" and that it's ""weaponized incompetence."" 

To be honest, I wasnt sure what her point was. So I apologized to her that she had to clean it up. She sent more voice memos, explaining she literally doesn't care ""AT ALL"" about having to clean, but that it's just a really disgusting and disrespectful thing and she's worried because he's in my space and could be doing that (leaving orange peels???) in my space too. 

I started with ""Thank you for looking out for me"" but also explained that they were being unreasonably harsh. I told her she can share things that bother her, but if it doesn't bother me, then it doesn't bother me. I told them we're all human, and I also mentioned that I dont see them holding their friends or my friends to the same standard (we've had so many pres at this apartment, so much shit left around in the tables. Even that night I remember having left some candy wrappers there, but that wasn't mentioned). 

They sent more voice messages, explaining that they definitely hold everyone to this standard, and it came off as disrespectful, but if I'm not bothered then fine. I just said ""Okay"" back. 

I haven't told my boyfriend this. But since then, they haven't seen each other because I'm just not comfortable bringing him around someone who judges him so harshly. If one of his friends was judging me like this, I would be crushed. Ultimately, because me and my boyfriend soend a lot of time together, it has tesulted in me seeing my friend less. But at the same time, I want to see her less because of her weird reactions. When I do see her, she always has some weird comment to make about my relationship. When I said I'm going to his offices holiday party, she suggest that it was moving too fast. Same thing with meeting his friends. When she comes over and sees his stuff (like a bag of tobacco, a pair of slippers, toothbrush) she says, verbatim, every single time, ""oh so he's all moved in!"" and kind of does this face that's like wincing, pained, concerned, but also laughing. My other friends have seen this friend do that twice now, and over text they say something every time i mention him. 

I told another (long distance) friend about the whole situation, they said I'm overreacting and it's not fair to keep my friend out of this aspect of my life. In my opinion, I think I should tell her and explain why her behavior is freaking me out. But part of me just wants to end the friendship. It's been on the rocks for like a year- we don't see eye to eye on things, they're reactionary and judgmental, and all around very negative. AIO? What should I do? Maybe this is better suited for the /advice sub? Appreciate any feedback.

Context, hindi nagcollege ung kapatid niya since sabi nito plano niya daw ay magtrabaho muna before college which they supported kaya di nag enroll ung brother. 

Its been a year, ung trabaho na plano niya di nangyari kasi masyadong... mataas? Niyayaya siya ng boyfriend ko na magtry mag apply sa trabaho pero di naman ginagawa ng kapatid niya kasi andaming rason. Nabother ako last time nag vent sakin bf ko, may opening daw sa isang coffee shop tas need ng barista, tas open for no experience applicants, so he tried his brother to apply kaso sabi nung brother masyadong malayo, when in fact halos sa loob lang ng subd nila. Tas ang reason ata ay hindi daw niya talaga bet magbarista kasi di fit sa image niya! 

Medyo talking kami nung gf nung brother tapos napapansin ko ung gf ung nagwowork. Like siya eager mag apply para may pang date sila and shit tas ung jowa niya adik sa games. May clan ata sa cod na need panatiliin active so that's what he does it all day tapos kinakausap ng jowa ko na wag ubusin time sa ganyan kasi need talaga niya ng support since broken fam sila so mostly ung jowa ko nagsusupport sa household nila, kahati ung mom nila. 


Sabi nung brother escape niya raw. Ung jowa ko mas mabait pa sa santo istg pero napupuno na siya kasi after 12hrs shift niya uuwi siya ung labahin daw di manlang nasasalang. Sometimes ung mga batang kapatid nila di pa nakakakain kasi di nagluluto/nakalimutan magsaing nung brother niya. Ung bahay ang kalat tas ung garahe puro dumi ng aso. 

Nauubusan na rin ako payo sa jowa ko tbh. I always advice him to give his brother some time kasi malay mo confused pa siya sa ginagawa niya sa buhay. Pero medyo naawa ako kasi kahit ultimong household chores nalang since nasa bahay rin naman ung kapatid, di niya magawa kaya after shift ( kadalasan 2am or 4am uwi) ng bf ko siya naglalaba, naglilinis, nagaayos ng bahay nila kasi ung mom hindi masyado matutukan kasi sakitin at cc.

My daily routine typically goes like this,
-8am: wake up, feed and change the baby
-let the dogs out
-feed the animals
-feed all fish tanks 
-take out the trash
-do dishes
- sweep/mop
-start daily load of laundry
-have a coffee
-vacuum
-make the bed
-dust and windex all glass
-change the cat box
-clean the bathroom

Anyone with kids knows each task takes 4x longer. And with a puppy and kitten on top of it, forever longer.

Yesterday I woke up and started my routine as usual, but had to carpet clean due to having a puppy. My partner vacuumed and that‚Äôs it.

I finished my chores and sat down around 11:30am, to enjoy my coffee and let my back rest since I have really bad back pain from my epidural.

My partner tells me I‚Äôm being lazy since I hadn‚Äôt cleaned out the cat box and it should be the first thing I do everyday. He went on a tangent saying I have an easy life as a housewife and that I never do anything. I told him I would get to it in a second and I just needed to rest for a moment and he told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it done at fucking 6pm‚Äù so he leaves to go get food, the puppy gets excited that he‚Äôs home and does a little excited pee on the floor so I start carpet cleaning a second time, then changing the cat box. He gets mad that I won‚Äôt just sit down and eat with him, after yelling at me for sitting down and having a coffee before finishing my chores.

I do 99.98% of the child care, all the cooking, all the cleaning and pet care. But he thinks I‚Äôm lazy since I don‚Äôt condense it down into 2 straight hours of cleaning the second I wake up.

He does work, but it‚Äôs seasonal so he‚Äôs been home, doing nothing but playing video games. He says he‚Äôs earned it after working all year 12-16 hour days. 

As a mom, you‚Äôre working 24/7 on top of being a house ‚Äú‚Äùwife‚Äù‚Äù and doing all the cooking and cleaning.

Edit: we just got into an argument because towels weren‚Äôt clean, I‚Äôm not supposed to wash clothes and towels together, and I did 6 loads of laundry yesterday, all clothes and blankets. Yet another thing he called me lazy for, not doing more loads of laundry yesterday 

So Reddit? Am I lazy?

TLDR: I didn‚Äôt clean the house in a manner my partner found timely and he got upset, despite the fact he‚Äôs barely helped around the house since Christmas.",1,1737901163.0,relationships,25,0.67,False

Our twins are 9 months old. I am sipping on my morning coffee while watching them play together from afar. It suddenly hit me - we made it to the moment I was begging and praying for when I was surviving and caring for 2 newborns and healing from childbirth at the same time. 

The days were long and nights were even longer. The endless anxiety between feedings and keeping them alive was brutal. I then came to this sub and read stories about other POMs writing about how beautiful it is to see their multiples play together and the bonds they have.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm new to the area and have been on the hunt for a good coffee shop. I was browsing through Google reviews and came across one that made me pause,
CAFE FRIDA

What stood out even more was the owner‚Äôs response. Instead of directly addressing the concern or apologizing, they seemed to deflect, saying the staff just didn‚Äôt offer the reviewer alternatives of this unavailable item. Yet, according to the review, white customers still received the item in question.

1iafjpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tarot/comments/1iafjpu/help_with_a_reading/,Help with a reading,"It's been a very long time (nearly three years) since I've touched a tarot deck and I'm trying to get back into it. Mostly only ever used Thoth and Wild Unknown, but have always maintained the kabbalistic relationships of the GD system regardless (ignoring some of Crowley's innovations) since the RWS and intuitive reading methods haven't ever really resonated.

Anyway, I've mostly been doing readings for ""imaginary people with imaginary problems"" while I'm relearning, but recently something popped up where I felt the need to really engage and do a proper reading. I am 80% confident in my interpretation, but I also have always recognized that reading for oneself immediately biases the interpretation. So I'm just looking for anyone else's read on this to help me fill in potential blind spots. TIA!

For this reading I'm using the Thoth deck and a ""Circle of Advisors"" spread where the court cards are dealt separately as advisors and then the advice cards are interpreted according to the way the court cards would give the advice.

**The Reading:** (and how I interpret it)

The problem: A friend and I are generally aligned on politics, but are reacting to the current US-based political moment very differently. We are going to hang out specifically because of this (this is as specific as I can really be about it). My go-to way of giving advice and support I already know is not appropriate, so I'm trying to give myself some touchpoints on holding space and support while also not enabling doomerism.

Querent: I chose the Lovers for the alchemical associations of two opposites coming together into a cohesive admixture.

Advisor 1: Prince of Wands, fire of fire, immediate action and impulsive.  
Advice: 6 Cups: Pleasure, seek out things that bring pleasure immediately and hold onto them. Find the exalted place of calm and repose and bunker down. ""Self care"" bro.

Advisor 2: Queen of Swords, water of air, transient but soothing and refreshing.  
Advice: 7 Cups: Debauchery, the current political moment will pass so denying yourself the pleasures that bring you joy, even moderating the indulgence of them, will just make the current moment worse for yourself. Give in and indulge.

Advisor 3: Princess of Swords, earth of air, the idea has fully cemented as an actionable. Praxis over theory.  
Advice: 7 Wands: Valor: fix your position in the ideals you know to be true and let them be the anchor that guides your actions, but ***put the ideals to work!!!***

Advisor 4: Princess of Cups, earth of water, the heaviness of water, its penetration and damp, its ability to nurture as well as mold.  
Advice: 8 Wands: Swiftness: Stagnation is not an option. Whatever you do, do not dawdle or tarry. Too much emotional energy allowed to ferment will overwhelm the dykes and then there will be no choices left. All that will be available is reaction and survival and letting other people sort out the mess.

**Overall interpretation:** I feel like this is more advice that I would give to my friend, not necessarily useful advice for me in navigating my friend's support and diffusing of their current state. If it's for me, I am planning on taking them to one of our favorite spots here in town and treating them to coffee and ice cream, so I guess Advisors 1 and 2 are coming through there, but the other two I'm less certain on. Like I said, we share broad political ideals, and one of our shared ideals is community building. I know that just getting together to talk and hang out *is* community building at its most basic, but this seems almost too mundane for the 7 of wands. And then Advisor 4 is just...do I cancel our planned hangout to hang out sooner? That would require a very last minute change of everything over the next couple of days and would almost certainly create a terrifically difficult situation for me. But if Advisor 4 is not about the hangout itself, then I almost feel like it actually does apply to my friend and makes me think the rest of this is for them, as well.",3,1737900852.0,tarot,1,1.0,False
