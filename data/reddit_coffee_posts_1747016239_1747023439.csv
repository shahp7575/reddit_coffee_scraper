I‚Äôm a 28M (Indian, Software Engineer) who‚Äôs been living in Limassol but now looking to shift to Nicosia.. chasing cheaper, quieter vibes, and hopefully fewer tourists stealing my favourite souvlaki spot.

A few things I could use your help with:

1.	Good & quiet areas to live in Nicosia?
I‚Äôm hoping for something calm, safe, and not too far from civilisation (or a good coffee).

2.	Is 500 EUR/month for a 1-bedroom the norm here?
I‚Äôve seen listings on Bazaraki around that range, but wondering if that‚Äôs usual or if I‚Äôm being lured into a broom closet with WiFi.

I‚Äôve been checking Bazaraki (probably more than I check my work emails), but most immediate rentals seem to be rare. 
If you know any alternatives or leads, please help a fellow coder not sleep on a beanbag.

Also, if anyone‚Äôs into board games, say hi! A man must uphold his hobbies, even while migrating across cities. Catan, Carcassonne, D&D .. let‚Äôs roll some dice!

I‚Äôll be visiting Boston this week from May 13-16, for a conference and was curious to see what people in Boston would recommend to see, eat, or any events to attend? I‚Äôll be in the South Boston Waterfront vicinity but I love to walk and comfortable with public transit.

I went to the Museum of Fine Arts a couple of months ago and I did the whole museum (incredible). So, I may not go this time. For context, I enjoy art, science, nature, books, music (folk, alternative, punk rock, most genre just not EDM), history, food, coffee, and sight seeing. I don‚Äôt like loud environments for a prolonged amount of time (but I do have earplugs if necessary).

Thank you, I appreciate any recommendations!

I just wanted to suggest that those who are really suffering ask their doctors to prescribe Low Dose Naltrexone. I started at .5mg and titrated up .5mg every 2 weeks, to a max dose of 5mg. Take it in the morning, and it can take a while to see improvement so be patient (it was 10 weeks for me).

I have been bedbound or housebound about half the time over the past 5 years since my Covid infection of March 2020. Brutal chest pain, shortness of breath, debilitating fatigue 100% of the time, pounding erratic heart about 30% of the time, plus about a dozen other random symptoms that pop up randomly.

Some days I was too weak to sit, to talk, to lift a cup of tea. I only had enough energy to breathe. Other days I was better, could walk a few blocks, could do a few things. Since taking LDN over the last 6 months there have only been about 5 days where I have been bedbound, and it's always because I did too much 48 hours prior. My crashes used to last weeks, and the longest crash I had was actually 5 months last year. Just brutal.

Now I wake up, feel that familiar fatigue, have coffee, take my LDN and I start to feel better!! I am able to walk every morning. I need to rest a lot still, but I am not crashing, bedbound any more. My chest pain is there, but not as severe. I am still somewhat short of breath, but this has improved too.

I need to share this, as I was giving up on ever seeing improvement, and I feel the pain others here feel. The feeling of just being dead inside, the fatigue, the isolation, the constant battle, the chronic pain.

Today our lovely cast of characters is Julia (mother), Jane (my aunt, Julia‚Äôs sister), Henrietta (my grandmother, their mother) and me (34 trans man)

‚Äî

Today my aunt (who lives next door) invited me to go for a coffee with her and Henrietta. I get in the back behind the driver's seat with the dog (goofy little chunker) and we head out.

Turns out, oops, it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day. I‚Äôd been invited to tag along because I love coffee and car rides. I didn‚Äôt realize until we were halfway there, even then I thought ‚Äúeh, should be fine.‚Äù

When my grandmother (who lives with Julia) comes to say hello to the dog, she spots me sitting in the back and her mouth drops open. She gasps, puts on this whole act of heartbreak and distress, sniffling and hyperventilating before finally exclaiming ‚ÄúJULIA‚Äù

She doesn‚Äôt acknowledge me, instead addressing Jane and repeatedly asking ‚Äúcan Julia come?‚Äù We don‚Äôt have enough space in the car for everyone, so eventually Henrietta says she can‚Äôt come. My aunt gives her a card and we head off to get a coffee on our own.

I‚Äôd considered sending Julia a ‚Äúhappy Mother‚Äôs Day‚Äù to keep the peace, but I don‚Äôt view her that way and it twists my gut to force it. Her and my grandmother used to force me to do and say a lot of things to keep up the happy family appearance.

Meanwhile Jane and Julia also have a strained relationship, so inviting Julia to ride with us wasn‚Äôt really an option to begin with. In the past, Julia has admitted to feeling like my aunt is responsible for our shitty relationship. She also believes my aunt wants to replace her as the role of mother. The truth is, my aunt supported my attempts at reconciliation and I have zero interest in anyone filling that role in Julia‚Äôs stead. We‚Äôre just weirdly similar and enjoy eachothers company.

So you‚Äôd think that‚Äôd be it, right? Kind of a shitty reaction but whatever.

We get to the coffee shop and my aunt suggests ‚ÄúOh! Do you want to invite Julia and mom to come meet us here?‚Äù I think about it, then shrug like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt not want to see her, so sure. I‚Äôll even text her.‚Äù At the time I was comfortable with both of us being in the same vicinity and viewed it as an offer of goodwill so I invited Julia and she said yes.¬†

Jane and I have our coffee and we‚Äôre sitting together chatting, waiting for the others to arrive. Then we hear a dog in the vehicle next to us whimpering pathetically while in a carrier. We're both so sad about this that we park elsewhere. (It‚Äôs cold out and the windows were all open, the dog is okay)

Julia texts me that they‚Äôre inside the coffee shop and my aunt and I both lurch like ‚Äúoh shit, time to socialize in public‚Äù before we stop and consider whether we actually want to or not. I don‚Äôt want to and say so, my aunt feels the same, plus we have a dog with us, that adorable chunker.¬†

I text Julia to tell her as much and we begin looking for where they parked. Yep. They parked right next to the pathetically crying dog car but neither of us say anything because Julia is weird about being told to do anything. We parked next to them and noticed my grandmother was still in the car.¬†

My aunt and I assume Henrietta‚Äôs either forgotten how to open the window or she‚Äôs locked in, I joke she‚Äôs trapped. She looks upset, though, and we get the feeling she‚Äôs ignoring us. Eventually she gets the door open but doesn‚Äôt greet me. Whatever, she‚Äôs chatting with Jane.

Julia finally arrives from the coffee shop carrying two cups of coffee. She walks around to the passenger side of her car, right past me, and makes a big show of giving Henrietta her coffee, some napkins, sugar packets, creamers, some stir sticks‚Ä¶ literally announces each item.

I call out ‚ÄúSomeone wants to say hi to you!‚Äù The dog is on my lap now, her tail is wagging, and Julia doesn‚Äôt so much as look at me. Mind you, I‚Äôm in the back seat so she had to walk past me. Twice.

We get the feeling that my grandmother doesn‚Äôt want to talk, so Jane suggests Julia turn her car around to face us, which she does. Jane tries to make light of the poor dog whimpering pathetically to Julia, because it‚Äôs almost comical that they chose to park there.

Henrietta exits their car and while walking over to sit next to my aunt demands ‚Äúgo sit with your mother‚Äù I quickly said no.¬†

Julia clearly heard me and is pouting, I don‚Äôt know if Henrietta did. Once she‚Äôs seated next to Jane and sees I hadn't moved she demands again ‚Äúgo sit with your mother‚Äù and again I said no. She for sure heard me this time and there's a minute of tense silence as everyone seems to take in the situation.¬†

The poor dog one car over is practically screaming now.

Henrietta gets back out and returns to the car with Julia and I assume she‚Äôs just going to sit and stew in her displeasure. My aunt later told me she heard her say ‚Äúthis is bullshit.‚Äù

I was still willing to chat with Julia, but Henrietta began complaining of a headache, then says she even took an Advil (she prides herself in never having to take medication until it‚Äôs bad)¬†

Julia still hasn‚Äôt said a god damn word, just sat there sadly. Henrietta then declares ‚ÄúTake me home!‚Äù And they drive away.

My aunt and I are sitting there just absolutely baffled by the way all of that went.¬†

\--

TLDR; I tag along with my aunt for coffee with her and grandma. Grandma is aghast that I dare show my face without also making it a happy Mother‚Äôs Day event with my own estranged parent. We invite them both to join us at coffee shop. They show up, and when I won‚Äôt play the doting son, grandma gets mad and they both storm off.

Where do I go from here?,"Hi all, so I found my current wedding photographer through Instagram about a year ago. I reached out to book her and we met for coffee that same week. She sent the contract and invoice and all seemed to be going well! A few months later, my fiance and I decided we wanted to change our wedding location and downsize on the guest list significantly. I reached out to her to advise of the changes, as well as confirm the engagement shoot set for this past March. She suddenly was significantly different in her prompt communications. I‚Äôd ask to hop on a call, she‚Äôd say yes for the next day and the next day would come and go with no call type of situations. I was eventually sending texts every few weeks with no response for about 3-4 months. 
She reached out, apologizing profusely, and stated her notifications were muted and she had no idea, felt terrible, blah blah blah. Things seemed to be back to normal with her responding nicely and we took our engagement photos. 
That shoot was 3/13. I followed up with her via text on 3/30, 4/13, 4/23, 5/3, left a voicemail on 5/7 and here we are 5/11 with not a single response or photo to show for it. I‚Äôve made 2 out of 3 payments so far ($1,800 currently) with no intention to move forward with her services. 
My question is, what do I do from here? At this point I don‚Äôt even care about getting the photos. I want my money back.

My name is Alex. 

I have had Paromisa ever since covid started . It has been horrible and it has ruined my life. It comes and it goes but when it comes it comes for more than a week sometimes 3 weeks it's been a horrendous . All my favorite foods taste rotten , coffee which I love so much tastes rotten as does water . My doctor is very nice and kind however he does not know how to help me even though I tell him all my symptoms and what I'm going through he insist I should drink water and eat food but the problem is when I do my brain is telling me wait a second you ate something rotten and all I do then is I throw up a throat for so many days it's not even funny and on top of that I get diarrhea sometimes at the same time thank God my toilet is next to the tub that's all I have to say. But it's so isolating it's hard to even describe to people people just think I'm always sick and that I need to go on a diet or watch what I eat little do you know the suffering I've been going through . I literally cry myself to sleep. I've missed so much , I've missed so much with my friends and family because of this weird disease that's definitely not going to go away. I have tried everything , I literally got myself smelling kits to try to train my memory . Thankfully I'm going to a specialist in June it only took 4 years however it sounds like they're not going to be able to do much for me . Like I said this comes and goes it's not all the time it starts out as a headache right in front of my forehead and then all I do is smell gas unless I'm lying down when they lie down I don't smell it as much. I wanted to ask a question has anyone successfully gone a long-term disability because of this? Hopefully I can get a document from my specialist saying there's nothing that can do and if I get the document I can go on long-term disability until I'm 65 I've already checked . But is that something I really want to do? Not really. I just want to be able to protect myself from work , I don't like missing work I work from home but there are days when it's so bad where my head hurts so much and everything makes me want to vomit . Everything smells like gasoline and everything tastes rotten. Thankfully I discovered this group and I realized I'm not alone. ",1,1747022512.0,Parosmia,0,1.0,False

The audio only worked if you stood in specific spots, and at one point they literally played what sounded like a Spotify playlist. Logistics were sloppy, and the whole thing felt like a high-budget cash grab. Not worth it. 
Did I dance my butt off - you bet I did!
Did I feel Fire Festivaled - oh yes, I did!
Waiting on that class action lawsuit‚Ä¶ 

I just don‚Äôt get how you can charge this much for a show held in a convention center‚Äîa space literally designed for high-quality productions‚Äîand still deliver such an uneven, underwhelming experience.
The audio was one of the biggest letdowns. The venue was divided into four quadrants, and unless you were standing directly in one of them, the sound felt muted and incomplete. If you ended up in a corner‚Äîor really anywhere outside those sweet spots‚Äîyou were only getting half the audio experience. For a show built around immersion, it‚Äôs wild that they didn‚Äôt account for consistent sound coverage. It made everything feel imbalanced and half-baked.
The visuals? They were fine. Some cool moments, but nothing groundbreaking. The multi-screen setup felt more like a gimmick than an intentional artistic choice‚Äîonly one screen really enhanced the experience. The others were hard to appreciate or even notice. It felt like a flashy workaround rather than a meaningful part of the show.
Then there's the structure of the show itself, which ran only two hours. For the first 45 minutes, the opener‚Äîboth musically and visually‚Äîwas painfully basic. It felt like filler. And after she left the stage, they played what sounded like a generic Spotify playlist for another 10 minutes, claiming it was a curated Philip Glass piece. Even if it was something by Philip Glass, that‚Äôs not what we paid $400 to experience. It felt lazy and disconnected from the immersive, high-impact experience they marketed.
Sure, the light show had its moments, but let‚Äôs be real: you can find similar or better visuals at almost any major music festival. And when you compare this to something like Coachella, where a $600 pass gives you three full days of diverse music, immersive art, and world-class audio/visual production, this felt like a blatant cash grab.
Even the logistics were frustrating. Our QR tickets weren‚Äôt even sent until we reached out to support. From start to finish, the whole thing felt rushed, low-effort, and wildly overpriced.

Last week, I posted in the Stupid Questions thread asking why pour-over coffee always tastes sour to me. Then over the weekend, I brought it up again while hanging out with some friends‚Äîbecause I‚Äôve really been puzzled: why does coffee sometimes taste so sour?

To be clear, I‚Äôm a total beginner. I don‚Äôt know much about coffee at all, but I‚Äôm learning! üê£

One barista I spoke to said something that really stuck with me:

‚ÄúYou should think of coffee as a fruit, not as a flavor.‚Äù

That completely blew my mind. Up until now, I always thought of ‚Äúcoffee flavor‚Äù as something bitter‚Äîlike coffee candy, coffee cream, coffee-flavored snacks. But actual pour-over coffee can taste way beyond that!

This week I even tried a fruit coffee‚Äîone with fresh lemon mixed in‚Äîand to my surprise, it was really good.

Thanks for reading my little ramble. I‚Äôm getting more and more curious about pour-over coffee every day. I‚Äôm planning to visit a well-known coffee shop in my city next weekend‚Äîif I discover anything interesting, I‚Äôll definitely share it here. Hope you don‚Äôt mind!

‚∏ª

They say the Lord don‚Äôt keep count when a sinner tries to dry out. But the devil? He carries a ledger.

Dry Springs Chapel crouches at the edge of Gallberry County like a kicked dog‚Äîhalf-collapsed roof, blood-brown watermarks on the walls, and a bell tower that leans like it‚Äôs whispering to the ground. No sermons since the ceiling gave way during Hurricane Opal in ‚Äô95, but Thursday nights, there‚Äôs always light from within. Twelve chairs in a circle. One metal coffee pot hissing over a rusted Sterno flame. A dozen folks confessing to the ghosts of things they drank to forget.

I wasn‚Äôt one of them. Not yet.

Bramble‚Äôs fingers were locked tight in her lap, and I could smell the leftover grief clinging to her from some story she hadn‚Äôt told.

But I didn‚Äôt notice the people as much as I noticed the room.

Twelve chairs circled around a mildew-stained rug. But behind the pulpit, set back just enough to feel deliberate, there was a thirteenth. A child‚Äôs rocking chair‚Äîsmall, wooden, back warped sideways like it‚Äôd been through a fire. The seat was carved up deep, grooves that looked like claw marks. Nobody sat in it. Nobody mentioned it.

Except me.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs that little rocker there?‚Äù I whispered to Bramble on the drive back.

She didn‚Äôt turn her head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Seat of Trembling Mercy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMercy?‚Äù I laughed once. ‚ÄúThat thing looked like it was waiting to bite somebody.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt laugh back. Just stared out the window and muttered, ‚ÄúSome chairs don‚Äôt need people to sit in ‚Äòem. Just sins.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I went again two weeks later. Alone this time.

Mama‚Äôs heart gave out in her sleep that Monday. Left the house too quiet. The silence grew teeth. I found myself gripping the bottle again like it was a warm hand, and then somehow I was outside the chapel. Like my tires turned themselves.

Only eleven folks in the circle that night.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Denny?‚Äù someone asked.

‚ÄúGone missin‚Äô,‚Äù a woman muttered. ‚ÄúSaid he had somethin‚Äô to confess. Said it was too big for people.‚Äù

I knew what they meant. You ever feel something rot inside you, but you can‚Äôt name it? Like your soul has a bad tooth.

Then I looked up.

The rocker wasn‚Äôt empty anymore.

A boy sat in it. Couldn‚Äôt‚Äôve been older than ten. Pale as skim milk, barefoot despite the frost. Fingernails chewed raw. Eyes glassy and too wide. He rocked slowly, evenly. The room buzzed with confession‚Äîmurmured sins, shared guilt‚Äîbut none of them noticed him. Except me.

When he whispered, it was only for me.

‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt done confessing.‚Äù

And I recognized his face.

‚∏ª

The dreams started the next night.

I stood in the pulpit of Dry Springs, the place lit with blue flame and shadow. The circle of chairs remained‚Äîbut all twelve were filled with drowned men and women. Their faces puffy, their bellies bloated like ticks, skin slick with river rot. Their eyes were all turned to me. Milky. Expectant.

In the rocker sat the boy. Still. Rocking.

‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt done confessing,‚Äù he whispered.

And behind them all stood a line. Stretching into the dark. All dead. All addicts. All waiting.

Waiting for me to say the name.

‚∏ª

I stopped sleeping. I stopped eating. I drank more than ever. I walked the banks of the Choctawhatchee until my boots split at the seams, hoping I‚Äôd find whatever it was I‚Äôd left buried in the silt.

The guilt took shape.

It became hands. Dragging me back to that last summer on the river. The drowning boy. The way I told myself I couldn‚Äôt reach him in time. That it was an accident. That I was too slow.

Lies.

He hadn‚Äôt gone under.

I‚Äôd held him there.

I told Bramble once, in a half-sober haze. We were sitting in her squad car. I said, ‚ÄúYou ever do something you can‚Äôt drink quiet?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt look at me, but her hand flinched on the steering wheel. ‚ÄúPlenty of things you can‚Äôt drink quiet,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut they don‚Äôt go quiet, either.‚Äù

That was the last real thing she said to me.

‚∏ª

She found me five days later.

I was curled up in the chapel‚Äôs vestibule, hands black with frostbite, nails torn from trying to pry up the floorboards beneath the pulpit. I kept screaming that something was buried under Step Thirteen.

Sheriff Sutton came himself to pull me out. My eyes were stuck wide open. I saw the boy everywhere‚Äîbehind his shoulder, in the patrol car‚Äôs rearview, peering out the chapel window even as it disappeared behind us.

They sealed Dry Springs after that. Nailed it up like a tomb. Said it was condemned. Unsafe.

But the dreams didn‚Äôt stop.

And sometimes, if I‚Äôm walking late past the county line, I‚Äôll hear that rocker squeak.

Back‚Ä¶ and forth.

Back‚Ä¶ and forth.

‚∏ª

I kept the bottle close after that. Real close. But it never drowned the voice.

‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt done confessing.‚Äù

Because I didn‚Äôt just let him drown.

I wanted him gone.

He knew what I‚Äôd done in that trailer by the river. He saw what I did to his sister before she slipped that needle in. He saw everything.

And when he came crying to me with a mouth full of secrets?

I held him under.

I watched the bubbles stop. I felt his fingers let go. I made it look like a slip.

The devil don‚Äôt forget.

And now?

Neither do I.

He‚Äôs still rocking.

And I‚Äôm still confessing.",1,1747021970.0,GallberryCountyTales,0,1.0,False

My coffee machine is a week old and I finally got it dialed in nicely (it was dosing 18g of beans, pouring 36g of espresso in 30 seconds and tasted great). Then I stupidly opened the settings menu to try and change how long the machine stayed 'awake' for and I somehow have disrupted something... I have NO IDEA what I have done, but now when I press the x2 button to grind my beans before tamping, it just keeps going and going and going until I have to manually stop it. I've adjusted the dose knob but it doesn't change anything - just keeps going and going even on the lowest dose setting. What have I done?! Surely it's an easy setting fix and not a fault??

Yeah, I know, absurdly overpriced, but, you guys get it.  Plus I‚Äôm in my fifties and if I don‚Äôt buy it, then what the hell am I living for?  

This is not the original ‚ÄúWho Goes There‚Äù.  We‚Äôve all read that and been over it with a tooth and comb.  This is the novel based on the original script prior to the final movie edit coming out.  Example, Windows was originally named Sanders, so he is named Sanders in the novelization.  It‚Äôs available on YouTube as an audio book.  Somebody else posted a link to that in this community a while back.

This new shit is in regards to why Fuchs says only to eat out of cans, because any small particle of the thing can take over an entire organism.  Okay, so that line never made sense to me, because it obviously takes time, tentacles wrapped around bodies, weird silly string from the dog-thing and Bennings writhing around in a chair and whatever else.  For example, if any small part of a thing is enough to take over an entire organism, then why doesn‚Äôt the Palmer-thing just give himself a nasty cut and get blood all over Garry, or the pinball machine, or the flame thrower.  Or, the Norris thing takes a sec to spit into Copper‚Äôs coffee, etc.

Anyways, there‚Äôs a whole scene in the book where Macready, Norris and Bennings are chasing after escaped dogs.  Blair doesn‚Äôt just ax-murder them, as in the movie.  So, the dog-things become things because they ate part of the original Norwegian dog-thing when they were trying to fight it off.  Fuchs references this as the reason to eat out of cans, because the dogs that ate thing-flesh were taken over from the inside out, so if the team member consume any part of the thing, it will take them over.

I know the thing is different from us, and from outer space, and why are we asking Macready when we should be asking Blair, but I just have to think that Fuchs is wrong, and the eating from cans thing is a red herring dreamed up by a sleep deprived assistant biologist.  Thoughts?  And before we go to, ‚Äúwell dude, we just don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I‚Äôm actually curious what you folks think.  Does it take an hour and close proximity like Blair thought, or is any contact enough?  If so, then why doesn‚Äôt windows soak that scalpel in hydrochloric acid and vinegar and Macready‚Äôs J&B before he cuts his own thumb?

p.s.  also new shit coming to light (some shit not so new):  Palmer was the back up helicopter pilot.  Childs was the mechanic.  Bennings was the meteorologist.  Norris was the geologist.  Nauls was the cook.  Blair was chief biologist, Fuchs assistant biologist.  Blair didn‚Äôt use a computer simulation, he timed thing cells taking over dog cells while looking at it in real time through a microscope.  Macready was primary helicopter pilot.  Windows was the radio operator.  Copper was the country doctor.  Garry was the guy in charge of this gang of idiots.  Also, the guys only had enough water to shower twice a week because of how much energy it took to heat water to a tolerable temperature.

This is a bit of a long one, so I'm sorry for that. Just kinda need to get some stream of consciousness complaining out of my system.

This is my first Mother's Day as a bio mum. I have a stepdaughter who's 9, my husband of nearly 5 years has not really celebrated me during this time. I've gotten the "" ut you're not my mum"", I've gotten the last minute gift after seeing my own mother spoil me. Last year I got a notebook for mums, which I fill out for the child to read about my life. I asked my SD if she'd be interested in reading it, she said, ""Oh, no thanks."" She does have ASD, so I understand. But it's a bit of a waste.

Anyhoo, yesterday I wake up after being up and down with the 6 week old all night (my husband slept through, at one point saw me up and ROLLED OVER to go back to sleep). I'm trying to get myself ready and the baby bag, we're going to my mums for morning tea. Little man decides during my shower that he's sick of being antisocial and wants to be Velcro. I've now discovered you.need both hands to dress yourself. This went on for nearly two hours before my husband wakes up and takes the baby (I'm in tears by this point, I've recently been diagnosed with PPD). He keeps saying, ""Why did you let me sleep, you should've woken me sooner,"" and when I questioned why he didn't set an alarm.... ""No, I want to sleep through."" Okay. Still haven't had a ""Happy Mother's Day"".

We go to my mum's, she spoils me with a little self care bag. Tea, coffee, cute slippers and some face masks. I love my mum. After 2 hours he's nudging me to leave. Still no Happy Mother's Day. We go home because I'm tired of him nudging me.

We get home, unload the car, he turns on the TV. I'm looking after little man. He then says, ""I'm going to lay down for a bit, I'm tired."" Mind you, I've been awake for quite a while at this point, so I'm mainlining coffee. He naps until  his mother drops by, I help my SD give her the Mother's Day gifts that I bought for her, not my husband. After she leaves, I get a message on my phone that I have a grocery delivery coming. Strange. When I open it, there's flowers, chocolate milk, doughnuts and cookie dough (the kind you have to slice and bake). I look at my husband, he said, ""You needed a gift. And I couldn't make it to the shops to get you anything."" I just laughed. This guy had told me on the Saturday that he was going to the shops to get me a gift, then sat on his ass watching TV u till the store closed. FYI: only the cookie dough and choc milk arrived. The flowers were, of course, sold out due to it being SUNDAY AFTERNOON!

I told him that a gift isn't important, just having him wish me a Happy Mother's Day was enough. He said he was waiting for a gift, maybe he should've gotten a card, etc... it wasn't until I said it a third time that he half heartedly says, ""Well, Happy Mother's Day."" I just looked at him, he told me to stop making him feel like shit. Sounds like an iss-YOU, not an iss-me. Your best friends wished me a happy Mother's Day hours before you did.

He did order Chinese for dinner (because he was craving it) and put on a movie. Then he went back to bed. I stayed up until 5am this morning with the baby, didn't get to sleep until after 5am. This is now my memory of my first Mother's Day as a bio mum. Sigh.",1,1747021039.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

1kkisvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kkisvl/shy_women_of_reddit_how_should_i_24m_approach/,"(Shy) women of Reddit, how should I (24M) approach asking a shy girl (24F) to go on a date with me without making it awkward? I'm not sure how to approach the situation.","Hello women of Reddit! There's this girl friend of mine that I find very interesting and attractive, and I'd love to ask her to go on a date, but I'm not sure how to approach it without making it awkward.

We met a couple of years ago, as she is friends with my older sister. She's very quiet and shy, but we've had the opportunity to chat during some special occasions (parties, while drinking a beer or two) and we've had great conversations. Actually, a couple of times I've got her to talk to me for hours on end, while all the other people were asleep lol 

Then I tried to approach her through online chatting (or sending memes on Instagram), all in a friendly (non-romantic) way, but she didn't reciprocate the intention to deepen communication. I asked her openly about it, and she told me that she really enjoys talking to me, but that ""she is like that"", i.e. not a very good talker. I took the hint and I didn't insist, and we've maintained a friendly, though distant relationship since then.

In the last couple of weeks we had one of the ""special occasions"", drinking a couple of beers while taking to each other for hours, and geez, I'm really captivated by her. Her way of speaking, the things she speaks of, her gestures, her hands. I am bewitched. So I was building up courage to ask her out on a coffee date (half-expecting rejection, which would be ok with me, though a bit painful), but something happened in-between.

She had to go on a week-long trip out of the city, for her sister's wedding. She needed a pet-sitter for her two cats and her dog, and I was the only one of her acquaintances that was free to do it, so I looked for her pets in her absence. She showed a whole lot of trust in me (gave me the keys to her house, offered me her room to spend the night if I wanted to, though I chose to sleep in her dad's room because I didn't want to feel like I was invading her private space). I took good care of her house and of her pets and she's very thankful for it. She has praised me a couple of times (in private and with other people) because her pets got along really, really well with me (I love animals) and they seemed very happy to be around me (I was happy to be around them too hehe).

So, she's said she enjoys my company, she trusts me, and she thinks I'm cool and caring. The thing is... I don't want her to think I agreed to look after her pets, just so she would accept going out with me. In reality I did it because she needed help and because I love animals, I didn't expect anything in return. But at the same time, I'm dying to know if she wants to go out with me.
Should I wait some time to ask her out? Should I refrain from doing it and just keep this as a friendship?
Should I do it once and for all and make clear my feelings towards her?

TL;DR: shy girl I really like enjoys my company and trusts me, but I've had trouble deepening the friendship with her because of her communication style. I want to ask her out, but I don't want her to think that I did something nice for her while expecting something in return. Should I just ask her? If so, how should I approach it? Thanks in advance, women of Reddit :)",1,1747020392.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1kkirzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1kkirzu/my_husband_wants_to_be_poly_and_i_accepted_but_im/,My Husband wants to be Poly and I accepted but I‚Äôm wondering if this is the marriage I want.,"Forgive me for how long this will need to be but there is a lot of context. I ( 40yr cis/straight f) and my husband (37yr cis/bi m) have been married for 2 1/2 years, together 5. We met during Covid and quickly were pregnant and have a blended family of three. The first years were a little rocky as he was navigating his divorce and his ex wife was dealing with a lot of mental health issues. A little less than a year after we got married, we talked a bit about him being bisexual/queer and because we were both raised religious, I had a spot in my heart to allow space for him to explore that other experience. I want people to get to be who they are but my only boundary was to start slow and no girls. A few weeks later I started to feel something was off and then I found him texting with a bunch of women. We had a big blow up about it because it seemed that this openness we made for our relationship was about his sexuality, and I felt it would be a different thing if he wanted to date other women. He expressed men were hard to talk to and make connections with without it being sexual first. But he still lied and that was a problem for me. 

Fast forward another year , my husband has been suffering with his mental health and the death of his mother and he made friends with a girl ( we‚Äôll call her Katie) he told me she was a lesbian with another partner and that they connected on being military brats and there was nothing to worry about. Well that wasn‚Äôt true and she ended up coming to me on ig to talk about something mental health related to him thinking we were poly when we weren‚Äôt and reveals that they had a full on online relationship with plans and had fallen in love. So he lied to her too. I found out on our way to buying gifts for Christmas with him in the car. When I told him what she said he said ‚Äú I think I should move out ‚Äú I felt blindsided . The next month was a barrage of apologies mixed with angry truths of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking of leaving you for 4 months‚Äù etc. Now anyone who has lived with someone with bipolar / bpd / or asd know that it‚Äôs a little less black and white when it comes to manic episodes, depression, suicidal ideation - which he was dealing with. But it felt bone crushing just the same for me. I couldn‚Äôt tell if he really wanted to leave or just felt that way during that time or said it to get me to leave. 

We went to therapy a little bit and got some clear air but trust has been out the window. I took some time for myself and left town for a month to give us some time to breathe. I told him while I‚Äôm gone he can basically do whatever he wants but needs to be transparent with me if anything was gonna happen. I wanted this to be an exercise in trust but also to see what he really wants because I think he wants this relationship but another part of him never got to explore being queer and just do what you do in your 20s. He was ultra Christian and married early with kids. 

Well now he‚Äôs met someone and while I was gone he painted their meeting plan as a ‚Äúcoffee vibe check‚Äù and it ended up being dinner and a hotel room. I know things can change but he already had the hotel room booked when he told me is was gonna be something quick and chill. This is the kind of stuff that really angers me because I feel like I‚Äôm already giving a lot of space for him to explore and I don‚Äôt feel considered. He had this knee jerk reaction to minimalise things which is lying imo. There‚Äôs all this explanation after about what happened and how things led there but the communication about what is happening seems inconsistent. 

So I just got back in the country from our hiatus and asked for ‚Äú3-5 business days‚Äù before they see each other again because I know he likes them a lot and I just wanted some time to feel like we could settle in before we go back into this ‚Äústretching‚Äù of our relationship and on Mother‚Äôs Day I had to ask him if anything like milestones has happened with this new person and he tells me they are going on a date tomorrow. Am I‚Äôm tripping that I got super upset by that ? We haven‚Äôt been home a week yet and he didn‚Äôt run it by me first before he confirmed. I‚Äôm new to this poly thing but shouldn‚Äôt it feel more like a team situation with being someone‚Äôs anchor partner ? It seems like he‚Äôs not taking into account the emotional difficulties this is causing me and the forethought to consider me so I can still make space for this process. He told me I could say no that it‚Äôs up to me, but why confirm the date for me to then me the ‚Äúmom‚Äù and tell him he can‚Äôt go. I‚Äôm not here to control him, I‚Äôm upset that he didn‚Äôt make that choice on his own. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs got tunnel vision and can‚Äôt see why I‚Äôm upset. I told him ‚Äúyou even have to run work stuff by me so this would be no different ‚Äú because we share children etc. He said that he knew my schedule was free because I told him when I was done working . And I feel like he doesn‚Äôt get it . Am I being crazy or controlling to feel like I need to be mentally prepared for my husband who cheated on me prior, to give me a more than 24 hour heads up on a date with a new person less than one week after we separated for a month ? I‚Äôm new to all of this and doing it for his happiness- not mine. I don‚Äôt even want this kind of marriage but I don‚Äôt want to cage him here if this is what he wants. I want to fins out what he actually wants so I can make an at least fully informed decision about our marriage. I don‚Äôt want to blow up our kids lives because I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúshare‚Äù . 

His two prior children have already been through so much and what makes it harder is it would be again ‚Äú up to me‚Äù to decide to ruin their stability if I wanted to leave. They all live in my house. He pleads that he wants to stay married and be life partners but why doesn‚Äôt it feel like that here in the small examples ? 

I know this is just my side of the story and I‚Äôm leaving a lot out for the sake of brevity but we had a major rupture in our relationship that hasn‚Äôt been repaired and my safety was to tell him to ‚Äúbe himself‚Äù or do what he actually wants so I could see behind the curtain on who I actually married. Not as a test, but because I‚Äôve seen where he hides. He lies to me to hide what he actually wants and I‚Äôm starting to think maybe our relationship is either - not what he wants but we have kids home and everything entangled  or it‚Äôs convient for him to be married and have all this and I‚Äôm giving him the chance to have his cake and eat it too. Maybe true poly people don‚Äôt think like that and I‚Äôm just seeing it from my perspective. I just don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm being blindsided over and over and that I‚Äôm just settling for this because I don‚Äôt want to split time with my kid. ",1,1747020310.0,polyamory,5,1.0,False

EF=96 % and small cysts in pancreas.  See detailed info below,"**Summary:**
After experiencing postpartum health issues following the birth of my first child, including unexplained weight loss and elevated liver enzymes, I developed intermittent pain under my right rib that was triggered by certain foods and alcohol. This pain subsided during my 2nd pregnancy but returned 2 weeks after delivery, accompanied by extreme nausea and other symptoms. Despite various tests, including MRCP and HIDA scans, the cause remains unclear. I'm seeking insights from others who may have experienced similar issues and whether gallbladder removal helped or hurt.

Hi there,

Five years ago, I had my first child and seemed to recover well postpartum. However, around three months afterward, I contracted COVID, leading to several ongoing health problems. Initially, I experienced a painless sensation of a small balloon inflating in my right upper quadrant (RUQ). I lost over 30 pounds within two weeks during the summer, then acutely gained an abnormal amount of weight a few months later despite no changes in diet or exercise. I went from being petite and healthy weight my whole life to obese. 

Postpartum, I had intermittent elevations in alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), AST, and ALT levels. While these mostly returned to normal over two years, my baseline ALKP never went back to the pre-pregnancy range of 40-50 and remained high normal for five years until after the delivery of my second baby.

For the last three years, I developed intermittent pain under my lower right rib, triggered initially by alcohol and later exacerbated by acidic foods like coffee, pickles, and oranges. These ""attacks"" lasted from a few days to a week, with increasing duration over time. Just before my recent pregnancy, I believed the pain was permanent, but it magically stopped around the time I became pregnant. I was pain-free throughout my entire pregnancy and could enjoy acidic foods and coffee without issues.

After delivering my recent baby, I felt fine for two weeks postpartum, but then the pain returned under my right rib, but NOW also under my left rib and my upper back, and this time with different and more severe symptoms: extreme nausea (10/10), malaise (10/10), dry mouth, sore soles of my feet, sunken eyes, and a strange rancid smell from my gut/mouth despite frequent brushing. 

Lab results showed elevated liver enzymes: ALT peaked at 216, AST at 110, and ALKP at 200. While ALT and AST have since returned to normal, ALKP remains elevated at 160-180. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) has been ruled out, and an MRCP showed a new focal nodular hyperplasia, with the pancreas exhibiting stable small cystic foci. A HIDA scan indicated elevated levels over the last five years, with an ejection fraction of 96% during my worst pain episodes. 

I've also noticed a tender lump near my lowest right rib that I can express by pushing down; I'm uncertain if this is related to my gallbladder. Despite countless scans showing no stones, my liver appears to be functioning poorly, evident from slightly elevated PT/INR, low angiotensin-converting enzyme, and low vitamin K and A levels. Although my albumin is within normal limits, it has been trending down over the last five years. A Fibroscan revealed 5.8 kPa with no fat, and MRI elastography was normal. With AMA testing negative, PBC is unlikely.

Hepatologists are puzzled by my pain but do not believe I'm heading toward liver failure. I suspect something may have happened with my gallbladder that could be causing chronic pancreatitis. 

I'm curious if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and found a cause. Did gallbladder removal help or hurt your situation?",1,1747019827.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Perhaps, like me, you navigate the world with a touch of social awkwardness. In the hustle and bustle of daily life, striking up conversations or forming deep connections can sometimes feel like navigating a crowded room blindfolded. But here, within the comfortable space of written correspondence, those barriers gently fade away. There's a unique freedom in crafting your thoughts, taking the time to articulate your feelings, and sharing your true self without the immediate pressures of face-to-face interaction.
As a mom, my world is often filled with pure chaos and never ending to-do lists. While I love my kidda, finding time for adult connection and exploring my own interests can sometimes feel like a luxury. Yet another benefit to meeting people online.
Beyond the realm of parenting, my curiosity stretches far and wide. As a teacher, I have a deep appreciation for learning and exploring new ideas. My interests are a bit of a tapestry, woven with threads of literature and history, the beauty of nature and the intricacies of science, the creativity of art and music, and the comforting embrace of a good cup of coffee.

* Brand new **Turin DF54 grinder**
* Total: \~A$900

**‚òï Option 2:**

* Consistency and reliability
* Okay with basic maintenance
* **Not a big fan of the Dual Boiler‚Äôs look**, but can live with it
* Making 1‚Äì2 drinks a day, solo use

Asset or liability for my resume?,"Tl;DR If you saw that someone had worked one week as a barista, would you be more or less likely to hire them than someone with zero experience? What if they lead with a reference/contact # from the store manager?



I got hired a couple of weeks ago with no prior coffee experience at a pretty hot new location for a local chain. It seemed to be going really well! I was working hard, learning fast, and keeping a positive attitude. I got tons of very positive feedback, even during a Saturday shift with lines out the door where I was on bar for 9 straight hours.

So I was shocked to get a call from my manager after only a week that I wasn't a good fit for the location and was getting cut. In retrospect it was maybe a red flag that all of my co-workers had been hired earlier that month and they still had more people to train after me? My hunch is that they overhired, but idk. I'm pretty torn up about it, tbh, but it was good experience.



So I'm applying for barista jobs now and I'm trying to figure out how to frame this. My manager (who seemed to like me??) said she'd be happy to be a reference. So for my last application I omitted it from my resume but included a cover letter that outlined:

1. I've been trained as a barista

2. Their employment needs ""had shifted""

3. BUT I got excellent feedback (in multitasking, speed of improvement, etc.)

4. My manager can confirm this and here's their contact #

just wanna to share a bit of my journey so far, especially for anyone just starting out or on the fence about trying keto. I‚Äôve been doing this for 2 months now, and I‚Äôm already seeing change in my body, energy, and mindset. I begun at around 205lbs, feeling tired all the time, bloated, and honestly not too confident in myself. My diet was a mess, lots of carbs, late-night snacking, and very little structure. I knew had to change something for my sake of my health.

I heard about keto sometimes back but always thought it sounded too strict for me. I done some research and reading stories here on Reddit, and decided give it shot. I clean out my pantry, stocked up on eggs, avocados, leafy greens, cheese, salmon, and got serious about tracking my macros. finally , I started.

The first week was rough (hello keto flu), but once I pushed through that, the cravings started fading and my energy actually increased. I used to crash mid-afternoon, but now I can even go through the day without reaching for a sugary snack or extra coffee. Feeling good with this achievement, no matter how small it might be seen. One thing that helped massively was finding a meal service called ‚ÄúEat Clean‚Äù that offers keto-friendly meals. sometimes I don‚Äôt always have time to cook every day, so having ready-to-go, macro-balanced meals in the fridge made it easy stay on track. the guesswork out of lunch and dinner and helped me stay consistent when life got hectic.

I‚Äôve also been walking more, hit the gym 3to4x a week consistently, drinking a lot of water, and getting better sleep by cutting screen time at night. The changes are accumulating.

I‚Äôm now down to 185lbs, clothes are fitting better, my face looks leaner, and I feel good again,  physically and mentally. Still have a ways to go, but the momentum is real. Love myself now.

If you're just getting into keto, my advice is: keep it simple, don‚Äôt stress over perfection, and focus on consistency over intensity. The results will follow. Remember that Discipline takes you to places where motivation cant. One meal, one day, one week at a time. Let‚Äôs keep going üí™

Bitcoin is everywhere these days‚Äîfrom online marketplaces to physical coffee shops, you can use your favorite cryptocurrency just like cash (but way cooler). And guess what‚Äôs bringing Bitcoin even closer to the average person on the street? Bitcoin ATMs. Yep, they exist, and they‚Äôre multiplying faster than your grandma‚Äôs cat collection.

So, what‚Äôs a Bitcoin ATM, anyway? Imagine your regular ATM‚Äîcold, metallic, and forever judging you for checking your balance too often.

It‚Äôs perfect for merchants, artists, fundraisers, lemonade stands‚Äîbasically anyone who wants to accept Bitcoin with style.

So picture this: You're at a local street fair. There's a Bitcoin ATM in the corner like some futuristic cash machine. Someone withdraws BTC, turns around, and sees your stand with a Bitcoin QR code proudly displayed. They scan it, pay you in seconds, and walk away with your product while you watch your wallet balance go *ding!* That‚Äôs the future we‚Äôre living in, and it‚Äôs happening now.

Bitcoin ATMs and QR code payments are transforming the way we think about money. No banks, no waiting, no middlemen‚Äîjust direct, decentralized transactions that put the power in your hands.

He likely wanted nice things, but you can tell he never asked for them when they couldn‚Äôt afford it. That quiet restraint says a lot.

He also never resents their past. No bitterness. Just gratitude, loyalty, and a mature understanding of sacrifice. In a way, he romanticized life before the wealth through books, imagination, and emotional depth instead of feeling sorry for himself.

How am I meant to do this again with a toddler in a few years? 

My little one is 3.5 weeks and I already I just want to sleep for an unbroken amount of time. I start to feel sick thinking about the night and having to be awake.

We had some issues where he lost far too much weight early on. And although he's back to birth weight now he's tracking below 5th percentile. I just let him go over 5hrs between feeds and I feel terrible, but he didn't wake and I was so desperate for sleep. 

He's combination fed and I knew he had 90ml formula before he went to sleep. 

On top of the sleep deprivation, I'm a very independent person and struggling with this little being needing me. I had a c section so I can't even drive and nip out for a coffee.

It's one thing after another and all the normal stuff too:

I'm stay-at-home with no support from my husband during business hours. If I drink caffeine, my anxiety spikes and I become super irritable and agitated and have so little patience. If I don't drink coffee I become moody and can't focus. 

My daughter is almost 3 and everything is a fight. Using the potty. Washing hands. Eating. Getting dressed. Literally any time I try to get any chore done. I have to feed baby in the carrier because if I can't multitasking playing with her, she screams like a banshee, and her screams are so loud I literally sometimes wonder if it will damage my ears. She hits and pushes other kids, she doesn't share, she doesn't take turns, the park and playdates are all a nightmare, and every transition is pulling teeth. 

I gentle parent. I read How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen. I set boundaries. I give her age-appropriate responsibility. She has a routine. I read her books about empathy, emotional regulation, behavior. I do time-ins instead of time-outs. I give her deep pressure-stimulation-outlets, I limit screen time, ive her quiet time, I try to create a yes-space. I take her to playgroups, playdates, dance classes, kid-friendly museums, I do quiet time, we play with neighbour kids almost every day. I give MYSELF breaks whenever I reasonably can, I take a full-dose of SSRIs. I practice deep-breathing and meditation. 

But it feels like before each day ends, I lose it at least once. When the baby stopped sleeping through the night it just felt like each day was an escalation until the weekend. And when I tried drinking coffee to cope, I'd be on the verge of a panic attack for all afternoon. My husband asked me to stop drinking coffee. But I don't know what to do. We can't afford help. 

How am I supposed to white-knuckle it?

TLDR; I yell when I'm too tired/over-stimulated and when my daughter won't stop yelling at me. I don't know what other coping Options I have that I haven't tried already. ",7,1747017557.0,toddlers,4,0.9,False

My brain, that glorious, sputtering mess, has conjured another Star Wars notion from the usual fog of mild despair and caffeine abuse. Don't get your hopes up; most ideas these days feel like re-heated caf from last week. But this one... this one might have just enough grim satisfaction to be worth mentioning, especially if you're the type, like me, who finds a strange comfort in the universe's inherent absurdities.

We're going back to **Tatooine**. Yes, again. I know, it‚Äôs the galaxy‚Äôs armpit. But hear me out. We‚Äôre not following some bright-eyed hero. No, we‚Äôre saddled with an **Imperial Investigator** ‚Äì which is just a fancy label for some poor schmuck in stormtrooper armor playing detective in a place where the sand gets into everything, including your will to live.

Let's call our champion of reluctant law enforcement... Kael. Just Kael. No heroic callsign, no fancy rank he actually cares about. He‚Äôs the guy who probably made one too many honest remarks during an Imperial HR seminar and now his career path involves sifting through the dregs of a planet that God, the Force, or whatever cosmic entity is out there, clearly forgot. He‚Äôs got that permanently unimpressed look that only comes from explaining to a Jawa for the third time that, no, his blaster is not for sale.

And here's where it gets that special kind of ""why me?"" charm: Kael‚Äôs not alone in his misery. He's got a family. A partner, maybe a kid who‚Äôs already too good at mimicking the sound of a womp rat dying. They‚Äôre living in some pre-fabricated Imperial slum that‚Äôs only slightly less likely to be swallowed by a krayt dragon than the average mud hut. So, picture this sad sack, strapping on his sun-bleached armor, knowing his day will involve mediating a dispute between two nerf herders over a stolen bantha prod, then coming home smelling of Hutt sweat and regret. It‚Äôs the dream.

The tone? Imagine a cop show written by someone who‚Äôs deeply tired of everyone‚Äôs crap but still has to show up to work.

* **The ""Department"":** Kael‚Äôs station is probably a crumbling administrative building where the most advanced piece of tech is a coffee machine that occasionally dispenses something resembling motor oil. His colleagues are a collection of life‚Äôs other participants: the rookie who still thinks ""serving the Empire"" is a noble calling (bless his naive heart), and the veteran who communicates exclusively through grunts and pointing.
* **The ""Perps"":** We're not talking grand galactic conspiracies. We're talking a local moisture farmer who ""accidentally"" rerouted his neighbor's water supply. Or a back-alley Sabacc game that ended with someone getting creatively acquainted with a gaffi stick. Petty, desperate, and depressingly human (or alien) stuff. The kind of crime that happens when hope has packed its bags and caught the last transport off-world. And maybe, just maybe, something vaguely important falls into his lap, forcing him to care for five minutes before the universe reminds him why that‚Äôs usually a mistake.

Sometimes I just sit here and imagine the paperwork involved. ""Reason for blaster discharge: suspect attempted to use a decomposed rancor spleen as a personal flotation device in a sand dune. Suspect did not float."" Where was I? Ah, yes, the inherent joylessness of Imperial bureaucracy. Apologies, my mind tends to wander down these grim, fascinating little alleyways. It‚Äôs probably a coping mechanism.

The point of all this bleak beauty is that it‚Äôs not about saving the galaxy. It's about one guy trying to do a job that‚Äôs 90% futility and 10% dealing with aliens who think personal hygiene is a suggestion. It‚Äôs about the quiet desperation, the gallows humor, and the weird, unexpected moments of‚Ä¶ well, not kindness, Kael isn't exactly a dispenser of warm fuzzies, but maybe grudging professional courtesy. He‚Äôs the type who'd complain about everyone and everything but would still probably share his last ration stick with a particularly pathetic-looking Bith, grumbling the whole time.

This is for those of us whose preferred Star Wars aesthetic is ""slightly used and fundamentally flawed."" A story about the Empire from the bottom looking up, with a protagonist who‚Äôs just as cynical as we are.

So, lay it on me. Is this brand of organized chaos something you'd watch? What kind of utterly pointless, soul-destroying cases do you think Kael should have to deal with on a Tuesday?",0,1747017027.0,StarWars,2,0.5,False

‚ÄúHow did it feel?‚Äù

The same crimson colour cascades across the walls, filling your eyes as your mind swirls to conjure an answer to the almost arbitrary question. A haze of panic clouds your thoughts, and for a moment, you're lost in the memories of it all‚Äîunable to separate the past from the present.

‚ÄúI was scared.‚Äù

You reply with haste, almost yelling, as your mind spews the first reply it thinks of. Something easy, digestible. 

‚ÄúJust scared?‚Äù

It was more of a rage-filled frustration; one which had not gone, ever since; one which lingers within one‚Äôs soul for a lifetime. An omnipotent presence. You want to scream. To tear your skin open and pull out your hair until someone understands. Until you understand. 	

‚Ä¶You stay silent. 

Silence. Silence irritated you. Made you feel like you were simply existing to wait for your death. And here it was again‚Äîan interrogation room. Cold, sterile, thick. Your thoughts rush to fill the void. Vivid imagery of the moments rushes through your head. You could still smell the gunpowder, you could still hear the screams. You could feel the splashes of red, warm, sickening, as it hit your skin. It sticks in your brain like a stain you can‚Äôt scrub out.  

‚ÄúAnd I am angry.‚Äù

You finally say, to break the pressure, to fill the awful, suffocating quiet. But, it wasn‚Äôt quite the truth. You were angry. Now? Now it's something worse. A nameless feeling had evolved. It stretched long and gray and hollow inside you. It‚Äôs not fury anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs confusion. Shame. A gnawing grief with no direction. 

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù the officer says, softening his voice. We‚Äôll need you to testify since you were friends with him before he did it. Are you willing to come to court?‚Äù

You flinch at the word ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù Your stomach coils, knots tightening with guilt and disbelief. 

‚ÄúCan I think about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, take as much time as you need.‚Äù

You walk out of the police station. The door clicking behind you is sharper than it should be. The sun is too bright, the breeze is too strong, and the city is too loud, too alive.  The world continues to move past you like nothing happened. It disgusts you. People are sipping their coffee, laughing with their friends, and scrolling through their phones. You are stuck. Frozen in time. Left in those hallways feeling an impending sense of doom, knowing the next breath might be your last. You feel like a smudge‚Äîlike something someone forgot to clean up. 

 why? Why? WHY? The word tumbles through your mind, sawing through your conscience like broken glass. Why did he do it? Why didn‚Äôt he talk to you? Why couldn‚Äôt you stop him? Why are you alive? Why did YOU get to walk away? 

The name of the feeling dawns on you. It isn‚Äôt just anger. Or confusion. Or fear. It's disgust towards him, towards the world, towards yourself. 

You sit on the curb, watching a leaf spin down into the gutter, for a split second, you wonder what would‚Äôve happened if things had been different. 

But there are no answers, just questions. 

And silence.

For context, I'm a 35 year old bloke from the UK, who had been single from the age of 26 to 34. The relationship I'd been in at 26 was horrible, and ended with a lot of heartbreak for me. 

For the next 8 years I stayed single more or less on purpose. I did the odd tinder or bumble date, but nothing ever worked out. I'd kind of got used to the idea that I'd end up all alone- especially after my dear old mum and dad would finally shuffle off this mortal coil.

Then last year, a match came in on Tinder. The most beautiful creature I'd ever seen. Same age as me. Not from these parts, but had come to the UK to do her postgraduate study, and now working here. We chatted on that app for two weeks, then I made the plunge and asked her to meet for coffee.

I had no idea that the girl who came through that door, smiling a bit shyly, would become the most important part of my life. That she'd become my life itself! We dated, and feelings started coming pretty quickly. I knew after about two months that this was different.

Last December, we took a romantic trip away together and it was then that the L word first appeared, and was reciprocated. Since then, it has been spoken or typed between us every single day. However, after that trip, I had a pretty significant mental health wobble, and I know that while it was super tough for her, she held on so tight- even when it was hard for her to hold on. Her love brought me out of it, and we've been pushing on together ever since. I think of it in the sense that she gives me the strength to fight the battles that I'm not sure up front I can win.

I can't imagine my life without her. Every time I picture her face, I smile like an idiot. And I found that seeing her cry hurts me in ways I didn't know I could hurt. If anyone upsets her, I'd gladly go through them for a shortcut.

All that matters to me is that we're together and that she's happy. And seeing her smile is more beautiful than a thousand sunrises. I now plan everything in my life around our relationship. It's not that our relationship is a part of my life- it is my life.

This is full on I know, but it's how I feel, and I didn't know it was possible to feel like this, and I didn't think anything this good would ever happen for me.",13,1747016615.0,love,5,0.93,False

I have achieved nothing so far, and I will continue to do so, not because I can‚Äôt, but because my family doesn‚Äôt expect much from me. I live to be thrown around and treated like I‚Äôm lesser than the average person.





I‚Äôm tired of being ugly. I‚Äôm tired of having to look in the mirror and see a fucking ugly worthless cunt. My face isn‚Äôt good enough, my body isn‚Äôt good enough, and my voice is horrid. I will never be able to love myself because I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs ugly and malnourished all my life.



I‚Äôve been constantly bullied throughout my life, CSA‚Äôd, physically and verbally assaulted, stalked home from work because of how I look, recorded in public, beaten, emotionally and verbally abused by my parents throughout my childhood and continuing into my adult life.

* ugly
* fat
* anorexic
* ‚Äúan emo pedophile who cuts himself 24/7‚Äù
* ‚ÄúKys. Cutting yourself is retarded‚Äù
* ‚ÄúSexual child molester‚Äù

I wake up, have a coffee and sometimes breakfast, go to work, come home, try to eat dinner, and struggle with sleep. I don‚Äôt fall to sleep until 2am, and I wake up at 7.¬†

I've (25m) lived in a 1-bedroom apartment for the past few years, but will be downsizing to a smaller studio apartment in Brooklyn. I'm ecstatic about the move, but am struggling with how to lay out the space in a way that feels calm, warm, and welcoming. I've come up with some initial layouts and am seeking feedback on whether/not I'm headed in the right direction :)

First, a bit about me:

* I love cooking at home
* I love tv and movies
* I occasionally play games on a PC
* I will occasionally work from home
* I'd like to have friends over to cook, play board games, and/or watch movies
* I'd like to put up art on the walls slowly over time

Given those facts about me, my wish list has been:

* A queen sized bed
* A comfortable sofa + tv setup for cozy movie watching and casual board gaming
* A larger table for eating + playing more intense board games
* A small desk for gaming/wfh

With all of that in mind, how are these layouts? Are there specific red flags with any of the layouts? Are there things I need to sacrifice in order to maximize the space? 

(note: the diagrams *are* to scale (dimension-accurate), where 1px = 1"". Additionally, I haven't included *every* piece of furniture. There may be additional pieces like bookshelves, plants, a small coffee table/ottoman, a nightstand, etc. Lastly, you'll notice a long, skinny rectangle in the diagrams - I'm intending that to be a ""light-positive"" room divider, something like wood slats or glass panels for added privacy for the sleeping area.)",1,1747016536.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False

What exactly am I dealing with?,"I went to the dentist last week for a standard cleaning, but this was the first time I asked about what these brown streaks/stains on my teeth were. I thought it was just from coffee consumption at first. The reason being is because after I started college I had unlimited access to coffee and that's when I started noticing some slight staining. That was 11 years ago. Since then they've looked just about the same. But anyway, when I asked what the spots and streaks were, the dentist told me that it was possibly early Tooth Decay, but then they stopped decaying at some point at left the marks. Before they were like this I remember having my braces removed (14 years ago) and there was a clear white spot where the marks were, I don't know what those were but they were visibly a different shade of white from my teeth. The dentist also informed me to continue brushing with flouride toothpaste and make sure it can remineralize the teeth because there's also some decalcification.
