1hrqjsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1hrqjsj/part_2_ukrainian_and_russian_women_are_not/,Part 2: Ukrainian and Russian women are not desperate or suffering. You are the pig they are slaughtering.,"Happy New Years to all my fellow passport brothers, to all those who I am able to share my hard learned lessons, and to all those that find my painful experiences funny, or deserving because I am not as smart as you, or because you think I am a bad man for taking advantage of “poor women”,  I wish all a good year going forward.

Answers to some questions:

I noticed a few brothers here mentioning my race as an American born Chinese. From my own experiences it wasn’t really a big issue to be honest, I don’t know why, maybe because I’m 6’2 and played basketball and wrestling in high school may have helped me?

To one of my Armenian passport brother that’s from Australia, from my experiences, the Armenian women from Armenia are very similar to Russian women. The biggest difference is that they are less inclined to date outside their race, just like Georgian women. However, due to many years of cultural assimilation between the Russians and Armenians, the women there basically the tan version of Slavic women.

To the passport brother who is into Kazakh women, they are basically the Asian version of Russian women. They are Russian on the inside and Asian on the outside. 

To the passport brother who is a veteran like myself and wanted to know how I met all these Russian speaking women, I met them abroad using my American passport.

No, I have never led with my money or wallet going abroad as a passport bro, these women didn’t know I had money beforehand. Yes, I did take them to nice places to eat a few times for dinner and it’s really because I wanted to eat at a nice place more so than me feeling pressured to do it. Most of the time it’s just a simple coffee and tea date especially the first time we meet.

To passport bros or females who think I am taking advantage of poor women from the war torn countries, I actually met my Ukrainian ex wife before the Maidan revolution. I was in Ukraine when Russian license plates proliferated in Kyiv. 

To the passport brothers asking me why I married? Because this was before the passport subreddit was created and there were no other resources out there that could give me or other men guidance on how to navigate such turbulent women. This was before WhatsApp and Telegram days. Before Instagram and Tinder days. I was in my mid 20’s and she was in her mid 20’s as well. This wasn’t an age gap marriage and I felt that we had a genuine loving relationship and I wanted to start and build a happy family together with her. I had nothing but love and good intentions for my Ukrainian ex wife. Since there weren’t any resources for me to learn online I was basically flying in the dark without a GPS and I eventually crashed and burned like many other good men out there that had genuine and honest intentions for their Ukrainian wife.

The Russian ex wife, I didn’t bring her to America. I learned from my previous experiences and wanted to live with her in Russia. It’s still too painful to talk about some of the things that happened but basically when she realized she will have zero chance to move to America and I wasn’t budging, the marriage was already on the decline. What made this very tragic was that I vetted her and she came from a modest background and wasn’t the typical flashy Moscow women. She prayed, lived simply, and worked in an honest job. Even despite all the vetting I did, she still changed after marriage and it’s why I am here to share my experiences to all passport bros that no matter what you do or how long you vet her, or how much you think you know her, you don’t really know what will happen until you both have wedding rings on each finger and gradually she will begin to open up her true nature. 

To all the passport bros who are saying women all over the world are like this I appreciate your input, I don’t have experiences in marriage with Asian, Latina, African, Indian, or etc. my only life experiences are with mostly Russian speaking women. Yes I did had relationships with American women when I was younger in my early 20’s and below but it wasn’t as serious.

And the passport bro on why I didn’t date or marry the Asian women or Chinese women, it’s because, sadly, I got PTSD from the tiger mom, tiger wife type relationship. My mom was a tiger mom, my sister is a tiger wife to her husband, and the myriad of other examples I’ve seen with my own eyes of Asian women’s true nature. I wanted a fresh start and I thought Slavic women would be potentially a better choice. Of course now u learned a very valuable lesson and lost everything in my life.

1hrqex9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hrqex9/i_dont_have_a_go_to_person/,"I don't have a ""go to"" person ","I broke up with my ex about a month ago. Literally all of my friends have partners except for me. To be fair, I don't have a ton of friends, but it still makes me feel lame. They all have someone they can lean on, and I just have myself I guess. 

It really hit me when I ended up on the wrong bus and ended up in a different city. It was the opposite direction from where I needed to be. Now, I have absolutely no sense of direction, so I didn't trust myself to get back without fucking it up. I've gone on more than a few terrifying detours because I got myself lost, tried to correct it, and got even more lost. Plus, it was getting dark. I wanted someone to rescue me, so I scrolled through my contacts like ""who should I inconvenience now?"" 

The answer was no one. I cried about it and just called an Uber because I didn't want to mess with anyone else's night. It was my mistake anyway, so why make someone else deal with it? It did make me realize that if literally anyone I know was in that situation, they could have just called their partner and not had to awkwardly sit in the back of an Uber while lying about going to their non-existent boyfriend's place. 

Now I'm just thinking about the fact that I don't have anyone to share stuff with. If there's a new coffee place I want to go to, I have to either experience it alone (which is still fun) or call up a friend and schedule it weeks out. I don't have anyone to drag with me to craft stores or thrift stores. I don't have anyone to run errands with or bring as emotional support when I go to the mechanic's (for some reason, the mechanic's makes me weirdly nervous). It's just me. I like me and all, but fuck. 

It's dumb. I don't even miss my ex specifically, just the feeling of being looked out for and looking out for someone in return. I also kind of doubt I'll ever have that again since I'm asexual. The people who would be willing to date me are far and few in between and I can't help but feel like this is just how I'm supposed to love the rest of my life. I'm not a fan.

The previous owner has already replaced the burrs with new ones from Mazzer. These are available and reasonably priced.

What should I know about this grinder? How can I check its condition?

We weren't intent on ticking things off a checklist so this isn't the post to check to make the best use of time in the city as a first time visitor. 


The trip was to be one week long and except for travel and stay we had nothing else planned, the intention was simply to enjoy the city. We stayed in Gariahat for one part and Bhowanipore for the remaining part, used public transport daily and walked around the city a ton. We covered a maximum of two (& sometimes only one) visiting points per day and ate at whatever place was around, wherever we were. The only intentional eating spots were No. 6 Ballygunge place, Indian coffee house at college street and Burma Burma. Plus the sweet shops wherever we were and at Ramdulal Sarkar street. The rest were tiny eateries which were in no way less memorable. There wasn't a spot where i didn't like the food and there was something to eat everywhere. I follow a vegetarian diet for the most part but had decided to not restrict myself for the kolkata trip so had a bite of whatever non-veg thing my friend was having lol. The only issue with the food was me starting to miss having vegetables other than aloo and gobi. We are from Tamilnadu and the vegetarian food offers variety everywhere in the State. 


The main and most impactful thing about the city, for me, was it's historic significance. I am so excited to go back home and read up on all the Bengali freedom fighters and works by notable Bengali personalities. Alipore jail museum, in particular, had so much to say and I was moved by the stories. Tagore house was another place where I was in awe of the kind of history it stood for. Besides all of this it was such a delight to walk around and chance upon old heritage buildings, some unkempt and some well maintained. I sincerely hope those beautiful buildings are restored and maintained with the care they deserve. I am personally not a big fan of sky rise buildings and ultra modern environments so i found Kolkata to be a beautiful mix of modern and heritage. The towering personalities the city has spawned has left it's mark on me. (I may have indulged in the corporate life a little too far and forgotten our history lessons so please excuse the harping on about 'history' and 'heritage').


I lurked on this sub for tips etc and found many useful things, so a big thank you for that! I didn't pack rasagullas for the flight and instead got dry sweets (sandesh, gur balls), got nolen gur from biswa bangla, visited Dakshinapan (which, to be fair was also suggested by a local friend, and was SO good) for shopping, all thanks to this sub. 


Another thing to note, I speak very little Hindi and my friend speaks very little of Hindi and Odiya, and we managed to have a nice time even while using the bus frequently. We also managed to travel by bus, tram, local train, metro, yellow taxi and auto, and we thought it a nice accomplishment of sorts haha.

I recently had a misunderstanding with my partner about buying milk, which left me feeling unappreciated. She asked if I had been shopping, and I told her I bought milk to make bread rolls. Her reaction was, ""Great, so if you weren't making the bread rolls, you wouldn't have thought about getting milk for me to have coffee.""

This really upset me because it's not true. I actually bought the milk with her in mind, knowing she’d want it for her coffee. It feels like no matter what I do, she always thinks I don't care about her, even when I make an effort. I explained this to her, but I don’t think she believes me. She still thinks I was only considering myself.

Later, I asked her how her week was, and she initially said, ""Nothing happened, it was fine."" When I pressed further and asked more specific questions, she opened up and talked for 30 minutes about various things that happened. This irritated me because it felt like I had to pry to get her to share, even though we hadn't seen each other in a week.

For context, I always ask how her day was when I get home, but she works from home and often says, ""Nothing happened,"" which she finds annoying. I suspect this habit may influence how she responds to my questions.

1hrq8oy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrq8oy,Blue Heaven to Bobbi Brown in 2024,"In 2024, I explored if big buck makeup makes any difference, and TLDR yes it does. Reddit really helped in this journey, from deals to reseller/declutter purchases.

Skin Type- Dry, sensitive and non-acne. Eczema and rosacea prone. 

Shade Reference- MAC NC20, Maybelline 120, Estee 2W1 Sand, Neutral-warm olive.

Environment- Humid. I spend my days at a hospital or in a sample-handling laboratory. Due to this professional hazard, I hate using my hands for makeup. Any tub container gets instant negative points. 

Pre-Base- 

1. Lakme Lumi Lit Cream (Dewy Rose)- 7/10 Perfume scent, caused slight reaction. Watery consistency, makes me look so radiant, amazing base category. Panned despite the reaction. Would buy a better product in this category.

2. Blue Heaven Primer- 5/10 Couldn’t notice any difference.

3. Charlotte Tilbury Eye Cream- 9/10 Eye creams before concealer make a big difference! Wish I didn’t have to dip my finger in that tub. No scent, perfect.

4. Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream- 7/10, Any moisturizer can give the same performance, ex. Nivea blue tin. Works for all skin types, as it is perfectly balanced between creamy and water-like lightweight texture. 


Foundation- 

1. MAC Sample (Studio Fix Fluid Shade C4)- 3/10, Oxidises immediately. Bad shade match, I look extremely orange. 

2. MAC Sample (Studio Fix Fluid Shade NC20)- 4/10, Oxidises in one hour. Great initial shade match, turns darker in an hour. 

3. Estee Lauder Sample (White container, Double Wear Stay-in-Place, Shade 2W1 Sand)- 10/10  Doesn’t oxidise, wears through the night. 

4. Blue Heaven (104 Natural)- 2/10 Oxidises to orange in minutes 

5. Swiss Beauty BB (03)- 6/10 Deposits no tint, makes skin slightly glossy.

6. Loreal Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation(125 Natural Rose)- 10/10 doesn’t oxidise, doesn’t settle into creases. Pump packaging is great. 


Dimension-

1. Insight Concealer(NC1 Porcelain)- 8/10 Good shade match, doesn’t oxidise, just don’t like tub packaging

2. Maybelline Age Rewind Concealer(120 Light)- 9/10 Hate the sponge tip. Brightening concealer shade on me, cream to powder formula. More blurring and longwearing than Insight. 

3. Peripera V Shading(03 Hazel Grey)- 7/10- Low saturation, low pigment payoff, standard KBeauty norm. Shade is too light for jawline, and my nose looks muddy, but that’s my skill issue. Easy to use as a beginner tho

4. Essence Bronzer Stick(Cinnamon Spice)- 5/10 very strong watermelon scent, plastic stick packaging cracked too easily. Got acne due to this product. Colour was nice tho. 

5. Insight Highlight(04 Moonstone)- 7/10 not chunky glitter, not longwearing. I don't like tubs.

6. Maybelline Strobe Cream(Pink)- 7/10 Too cool-toned for my face. Used as body highlighter after mixing with lotion. 


Eyes-

1. Vega Eyelash Curler- 9/10 sometimes pulls out my lashes

2. Zudio Brown Eye Pencil- 3/10 Didn’t realise how draggy and dry it was till I tried Huda. Always flaked onto my undereyes and settled into creases. 

3. Huda Creamy Kohl(Very Vanta)- 10/10 Smooth application and settles in seconds, doesn’t budge even on scrubbing it. No fallout or flakes. 

4. Blue Heaven Extreme Length- 4/10 Clumpy, weighs lashes down

5. Maybelline Hypercurl Mascara- 9/10 Lightweight, affordable, washed by water. Good for everyday use. 

6. Too Faced BTS Waterproof Mascara- 8/10- Suffering from success, way too waterproof. Can’t remove with oil, cleanser, or balm. Great for events though. 

7. Elf No Budge Eyeshadow stick(Magnetic Pull)- 5/10 Too dry, had to drag and pull on eyelid. Might be a batch issue. Lovely colour, cool grey-taupe. 

8. Bobbi Brown Eyeshadow Stick(Golden Pink)- 10/10 So creamy, very fine glitter. Looks very elegant, great for inner eye highlight. 

9. Essence Make Me Brow- 7/10 Decent colour deposit, doesn’t hold brows in place though. 

10. Dazzler Eyeliner- 6/10 Bottle dried up quite soon. Budges too easily with sweat


Blushes-

1. Red water tint bought at local shop- Loved and panned. 

2. Etude house water tint(Strawberry Ade)- 7/10 Has strong scent, shade range could be better. Looks like I ate a beetroot, it’s too opaque/saturated. Benefit tint is more natural looking. Nevertheless, easy to use for no-makeup days. 

3. Flower Beauty blushes(Sweet Pea and Hibiscus)- 10/10 SO buttery. Non-patchy, doesn’t lift foundation. Sweet pea is a cool toned, muted baby pink, which I find a little hard to pull off for an everyday look. Suits an “I’m cold” makeup look. Hibiscus is warm midtone pink with a golden sheen. Looks intimidating on pan, but very flattering on skin.

4. Etude House Cookie Blush(02 Sweet Coral Candy)- 10/10 buttery and natural. I use it everyday, will pan soon. 

5. Insight(Soft salmon)- 7/10 Very pigmented. I personally prefer a sheer blush. This is an in-your-face orange, very easy to overdo the colour. 

6. Zudio Cheeky Flush(Apricot)- 6/10 Beige coloured, always deposits huge chunks during application and the stick is often dry

7. Incolor Stick(01 Youthful)- 5/10 Colour is nice, but it disappears immediately and only the glossiness remains.


Lips

1. Swiss Beauty (Choco Nude)- 8/10 Coral Brown. Slightly dry, but fairly longwearing

2. Elf Cream Glide(Pinky Swear)- 8/10 Very creamy but budges too soon. Light pink, too light for an outer lip liner. I use this as a lipstick, and it perfectly matches the shade. Looks like CT pillowtalk fair.

3. Elf Cream Glide(Mauve Aside)- 9/10 Best colour ever, but budges. Looks like CT pillowtalk medium. 

4. Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat (Iconic Nude)- 10/10 Doesn't budge even with water and aggressive smudging. Matte neutral(almost cool) brown. 

5. Revlon Super Lustrous (423 Rum Raisin)- 10/10 HG Red lipstick

6. Just Herbs (Glimmering Cocoa)- 9/10 Cool nude brown gloss

7. Renee Stay with me Matte(Rage of Red)- 8/10 Blue toned Red, too drying

8. Too Faced Lip Injection- 10/10 Lowkey gives lips an allergic reaction but best plump ever. So smoothing and blurring. I use this as a lip primer at the start of makeup and wipe off before lipstick. 

9. Flower Beauty Perfect Pout(Blossom)- 9/10 Neutral Mauve Brown, sheer and balmy. The soft bullet easily bends and touches the sides of tube during application. Scared to apply pressure. 

10. MAC Cremesheen (203 Creme in your coffee)- 10/10 MLBB Mauve, HG 

11. Maybelline Creamy Matte (656 Clay Crush)- 10/10 Use it as a brightening shade at the centre of lip. Cannot work on its own, needs a liner. 

12. Elf Hydrating Core Shine(Happy)- 8/10 Sheer pink, not too moisturizing. Not worth the price tag in India. It's just a tinted lip balm. 

13. Zudio gloss(05 Honey)- 8/10 The brown colour never shows up. Nice applicator, not very sticky or heavy either. 

Setting spray- Nyx makes makeup last a few hours longer than Insight. 

The vaseline box has home-made ghee in it. Dermat recommended, it has kept my eczema away. Favourite lip balm, I often just do ghee and lip liner. 


Hope this helps!

I didn't expect anything at all, but my parents went out of their way to buy pizza, chicken, and cake for me. My mom even made a coffee jelly dessert. I was very grateful for them and for those who remembered the day I was born.

Not until the unnecessary comment about my weight gain. My dad sent our photos to my eldest brother and his wife (they are working abroad). They were the first ones to greet me this morning, too. My brother told my dad I'm gaining weight, and he shared it at the table. He even asked me ""ilan na ang kilo mo?"" which I ignored. When I didn't respond, he directed his attention to my other brother, told him to stop drinking soda because it's making him fat.

Why ruin my day with borderline body-shaming comments? It's not like I'm overweight. I've been underweight for years until 2024. I'm 46kg now. What pisses me off the most is they get mad at me for skipping meals (even when I'm still full), but are too comfortable commenting on how I'm gaining weight yada yada yada

I'm so annoyed. I tried so hard to be neutral about my body, but my family's need to comment on every little thing keeps resetting my progress.

From what I gathered online, choices came to Baratza Encore ESP, Fellow Opus and DF54. I live in Slovakia if that makes some difference.

But I am open to other suggestions! So far I am tilting towards DF54. I was going to complain about ESP not having 51mm portafilter adapter, but it seems like in this price range it's not very advised to grind directly into the portafilter, so dosing cup it is.

44 fucking euro for the pleasure of it and here’s what I’ve arrived to find:

- The place is absolutely packed, there’s no seats left bar high stools and literally who wants that?! 

- The hot food “buffet” consists of eggs, sausages, hash browns and beans - that’s it. Oh and some manky looking porridge and a machine that makes pancakes. There isn’t even a toaster!

- Cold food - some chicken pieces, turkey slices, rocket, yogurt, baby cereal packs and tiny bread rolls (think ones you get with soup at a wedding except smaller and rock hard) 

- Coffee machines (no barista) but no coffee mugs, soft drinks and pre made sandwiches are languishing in a fridge that isn’t cold

Absolute waste of money. Please know that I’m by no means snobby or expected the world but I’ve been in the lounge in T2 previously and it was lovely and quiet and well stocked with fresh food.

* Grinder: 1Zpresso ZP6
* Grind setting: 4.5 to 4.8 (with 0 being as 1Zpresso recommend at the point there is resistance and the handle does not move)

This guide will walk you through every step of the process, from initial planning to post-event follow-up. Whether you’re organizing a small local seminar or an international conference, this comprehensive guide has you covered.

# 1. Define Your Conference Goals and Objectives

Before diving into logistics, it’s crucial to establish the purpose of your conference. Answer the following questions:

* **What is the primary goal?** (e.g., educate, network, fundraise, promote a product, etc.)
* **Who is the target audience?** (e.g., industry professionals, students, executives, etc.)
* **What is the desired outcome?** (e.g., new partnerships, knowledge dissemination, community building, etc.)

Clearly defined goals will guide every subsequent decision.

# 2. Build a Detailed Budget

Your budget is the backbone of your conference. Break it down into the following categories:

# Venue

* Rental fees
* Utilities (e.g., Wi-Fi, electricity, AV equipment)

# Speakers

* Honorariums
* Travel and accommodation
* Speaker gifts or tokens of appreciation

# Marketing

* Website and branding
* Social media campaigns
* Paid ads

# Staffing

* On-site event staff
* Event planners or coordinators

# Miscellaneous

* Catering and refreshments
* Signage and printing
* Swag bags or promotional materials

Pro Tip: Add a 10-20% contingency fund for unexpected costs.

# 3. Create a Timeline and Workback Schedule

List all key milestones and work backward to set deadlines. Use project management tools like Trello, Asana, or Google Sheets to stay organized. Here’s a rough timeline to get you started:

# 12-18 Months Before the Conference

* Define goals and objectives.
* Develop a budget.
* Research and book a venue.
* Identify and invite keynote speakers.

# 6-12 Months Before

* Train volunteers and staff.

# 1 Week Before

* Send reminders to attendees and speakers.
* Double-check all logistics.

# 4. Assemble Your Team

You can’t do it all alone. Here’s a breakdown of the roles you may need:

# Core Team

* **Logistics Manager**: Handles venue, catering, and AV needs.

# On-Site Roles

* Registration desk staff
* Session moderators
* Technical support team
* Hospitality and attendee assistance

# 5. Select the Perfect Venue

The venue can make or break your event. Here’s what to consider:

* **Location**: Ensure it’s accessible via public transportation and has ample parking.
* **Capacity**: Match the venue size to your expected attendance.
* **Amenities**: Check for Wi-Fi, AV equipment, seating arrangements, and breakout rooms.
* **Accommodations**: If attendees are traveling, choose a venue near hotels.

Pro Tip: Visit the venue in person before booking to evaluate its suitability.

# 6. Build an Engaging Agenda

A well-thought-out agenda keeps attendees engaged and excited. Consider:

# Key Components

* **Keynote Speeches**: Anchor the event with inspiring talks from industry leaders.
* **Panel Discussions**: Facilitate thought-provoking conversations.
* **Workshops**: Provide hands-on learning opportunities.
* **Networking Sessions**: Encourage attendees to connect and collaborate.

# Tips for Success

* Include breaks between sessions to avoid burnout.
* Offer multiple tracks for different interest areas.
* Build in flexibility for overrun sessions.

# 7. Market Your Conference

A strong marketing strategy ensures a full house. Here’s how to do it:

# Build a Website

* Include event details, schedules, and registration links.
* Optimize for mobile and SEO.

# Leverage Social Media

* Create event pages on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.
* Use targeted ads to reach your audience.
* Post regular updates and teasers.

# Email Campaigns

* Send invitations to your mailing list.
* Share updates and speaker announcements.
* Use drip campaigns to nurture registrations.

# 8. Manage Logistics Like a Pro

Logistics are the glue that holds your event together. Focus on:

# AV and Tech

* Test microphones, projectors, and internet connections.
* Provide backup equipment.

# Registration Process

* Use tools like Eventbrite for ticketing and check-in.
* Set up a well-staffed registration desk.

# Catering

* Offer a variety of dietary options.
* Schedule meals and coffee breaks strategically.

# 9. Engage Attendees During the Event

Keep your audience excited and involved:

* Use event apps for real-time updates and networking.
* Create social media hashtags and encourage live posting.
* Incorporate interactive elements like Q&A sessions or live polls.

# 10. Collect Feedback and Analyze Results

Once the event is over, your work isn’t done. Follow up with attendees and assess the event’s success:

# Post-Event Survey

* Use tools like Google Forms or Typeform to collect feedback.
* Ask about the venue, sessions, and overall experience.

# Analyze Metrics

* Track attendance numbers, engagement levels, and social media reach.
* Compare actual expenses to your budget.

# 11. Follow Up Post-Event

Maintain the momentum by following up with attendees:

* Send thank-you emails to attendees, speakers, and sponsors.
* Share event highlights via blog posts, photos, and videos.
* Begin planning for next year’s conference!

# Final Thoughts

Organizing a conference is a challenging but rewarding endeavor. With meticulous planning and execution, you can deliver a memorable experience that leaves a lasting impact. Use this guide as your roadmap to ensure your event runs smoothly from start to finish.

The main jest of the reasons we didn’t work was being on drugs, cheating, and feelings of abandonment on both parts. I really really held on to this relationship though, I tried so hard to be better and tried to maintain a good life outside of him always hoping he’d come around, and boy did I ask. He never did come, I did tell him as much as it hurts me he doesn’t come around anymore one of these days it won’t hurt as much, and then it won’t bother me at all, and he’d miss me. Well he has, and it is devastating. I don’t blame him at all for his sadness or the way he numbs it, considering it’s partially my fault. He thinks me telling him I can’t help him anymore is revenge for him not being there for me in the past and that’s just not it. I can’t help him, I was forced to move forward. I am seeing someone else now, he’s very understanding and kind, but how do I explain that I hope me and this ex exist in general happily in the future? Maybe not even romantically, how would I know that? I’m not dropping another good thing for someone i can’t bet on being a good thing again. I guess my question is am I terrible for not replying to my ex? He is very loved and thought of but if he hurts himself I know I’d be one of the last things he thought of and that kills me.

1. Identify why the binge started

💀this has NOT worked for me, my therapist always used to ask me this but I was embarrassed to tell her most of the time NOTHING happened 😭 like bro idk I was just thinking about food, nothing sad happed, Im binging every day food is in my mind 24/7

2. No access to food

This was VERY helpful at first, it is still very helpful till this day… however… If I really want food 🤡 believe me I will find a way. Im very social and most people would never imagine I have BED so its very easy for them to give me food… tbh a lot of guys invite me on dates often or buy me chocolate as gifts 😔 I know, I feel bad for accepting it just to eat but I cant seem to stop myself 

3. No junk food

Here’s the thing, this totally helped me to gain less weight BUT I would still binge 🤕 I know! Weird af! But Ive binged on lettuce, spinach, on egg whites, on bananas, on protein shakes LMAO 🤣😭 it also ends up hurting my stomach a lot because of all the volume :( or even making me puke 

4.  Telling other people 2/10

I think this would be VERY good for other people… in my case because im not obese and I used to be anorexic, everyone says Im just  exaggerating and that I look “in great shape”. So I end up just feeling ashamed and with no support

Chef Kiss 😮‍💨 this is just GREAT. Like if Im with my sister the entire day while traveling and visiting new places, NOT thinking about food.. this strategy is able to make wonders even during terrible binging seasons

6. Anti Depresants 4/10
So… 🤔 it made me feel less shame after the binge but I would still binge 

7. Drink water 2/10

😭 I binged on water and almost got water intoxication lol 🥲 

8. HOT Caffeine 6/10

Ive heard almost no one talk about this but it has helped me a lot. Drinking coffee and tea give me something to drink (have stimulus), tasty so it controls cravings and the fact that its hot prevents me from drinking tons at once. No sugar or milk/creamer.

Over the holidays recently I had to transport an injured animal. As I had been driving for over an hour I was hoping to stop somewhere for a bite to eat and a drink or coffee before heading home. The location was regional and very lovely. Also known for wineries. Not much was open. 

I bumped into the chef of the estate (which was closed) as I was leaving and asked if anything was open and he offered to whip me something up since I had done something kind. He seemed nice enough so I agreed. 

At first the conversation was quite normal although I was feeling like he was being too nice. I relaxed a bit when he told me about a couple who had a hit an animal nearby and totalled their car so they helped them out with somewhere to stay and food etc whilst the couple organised a hire car.

Once I started eating he asked me if I drank and then he asked if I smoked weed. Both of these questions set off alarm bells and I was thinking wtf and feeling very uncomfortable at that point. The very next question was if I had a partner which made me really uncomfortable so yes I lied. He said he didn’t believe me (for a racial reason). The reasoning irritated me but I didn’t say anything I just let him have his assumption. He also said something complaining about women in general, which I ignored as I did not want to argue. He then said I could hang out the rest of the afternoon. I thanked him for the food again and left probably 5 minutes after I finished eating.

So, AITA? He probably was insulted I felt uncomfortable and felt I had to lie. I am not very experienced with the opposite gender. Was I being paranoid/overreacting? Was I the asshole? It is hard to know sometimes when someone is being genuinely nice or if they have ulterior motives so I can be a little guarded. ",1,1735809738.0,AmItheAsshole,6,0.67,False

1hrpxg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AINewsTrends/comments/1hrpxg0/is_ai_in_everyday_life_making_us_smarter_or/,Is AI in Everyday Life Making Us Smarter or Dangerously Dumber?,"We’re living in a world where AI in everyday life is as common as coffee in the morning ☕. It’s in your phone, your car, and even your fridge. But here’s the million-dollar question: Is it really making us smarter, or are we just getting lazy and overly reliant on machines? Let’s break it down.

# 💡 The Smart Side of AI: Convenience, Efficiency, and Growth

AI is undeniably making our lives more convenient. From virtual assistants like Alexa to smart home systems automating our chores, we’re saving time like never before. Studies show that AI assistants can boost productivity by 30% in tasks like scheduling and organization. I mean, who doesn’t love shouting “Hey Siri, set a reminder!” instead of writing it down? 🙌

But here’s my personal take: I’ve learned so much from AI-powered tools. I’m talking about apps like Grammarly, which have genuinely improved my writing. It’s like having a teacher in my pocket! Plus, AI-generated learning platforms helped me ace my coding skills. So yeah, smarter in some ways, for sure. 🧠

# 🛑 The Dumbing Down Debate: Over-Reliance and Mental Laziness

On the flip side, are we outsourcing our brains to machines? 🤔 A 2023 report revealed that 42% of people rely on GPS for routes they’ve driven before. That’s me, by the way 🙋‍♂️. And let’s be honest, we’re letting AI do the heavy lifting, whether it’s math, remembering birthdays, or even thinking for us. This over-reliance might be chipping away at our critical thinking skills.

I’ve personally caught myself Googling stuff I should already know, and it’s embarrassing! Like, do I really need AI to remind me how to cook pasta? 🍝

# 📈 The Stats That Make You Think

Here’s something mind-blowing: A recent survey by McKinsey found that 63% of companies believe AI has boosted overall business intelligence, but 57% of employees worry about losing creative problem-solving skills. So, while AI pushes industries forward, it might be holding back individuals.

# 🧠 Can AI Replace Creativity?

Let’s talk about AI-generated art and content. Tools like DALL·E and ChatGPT  are reshaping creativity. But is it art if a machine creates it? Or are we just giving up on the messy, beautiful process of human innovation? 🎨

I’ve used AI tools to brainstorm ideas for my blog. While they’ve been helpful, there’s something soulless about letting a machine define your vision. It’s like comparing a heartfelt letter to a Hallmark card—efficient, but not as meaningful.

# 🔥 Where Do You Stand?

AI in everyday life is a double-edged sword ⚔️. It’s convenient, but are we trading long-term growth for short-term comfort? Are we evolving, or just outsourcing ourselves into oblivion?

What’s your take? Do you think AI is making us smarter, or are we slowly dumbing down? Let’s hash it out in the comments! 🗣️",1,1735809664.0,AINewsTrends,0,1.0,False

\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy).

1hrpqz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoungRoyals/comments/1hrpqz1/wilice_should_be_taken_at_least_as_seriously_as/,Wilice should be taken at least as seriously as Sirkus,"In season 2, we’re introduced to alternatives for our boys—a 'fourangle,' as Omar puts it. Yet, the romance between Felice and Wille is reduced to a single kiss that apparently scarred much of the fandom to the point of collective PTSD. Still, Wilhelm’s (likely unconscious) pursuit of Felice deserves its own reflection.

The show begins with Felice welcoming Wille back to Hillerska, pulling him away from the boys in a way that mirrors a girlfriend’s behavior. Wille comments on her hair—classic flirting—and she returns the compliment. We’re meant to infer that something might happen between them. Throughout the season, characters keep questioning the nature of their relationship, and their behavior lends credence to the rumors.

It’s Felice asking her friends to bring coffee for Wilhelm, but it’s also Wilhelm spending a lot of time with Felice in his room, treating her to dinner, or essentially 'Netflix and chilling.' It’s also Wille going to Felice when he’s sad about Simon, paralleling Simon going to Marcus when he’s upset about Wille—but that’s a story deserving its own exploration.

When Simon complains about not getting a heads-up, it’s because a Felice/Wille relationship was almost a foregone conclusion from the beginning of season 1. Netflix even used the thumbnail of Felice kissing Wille to promote the show. In the first on the table moment, August asks Wille if he disappeared with Felice—a nod to her being the richest girl in school, Hillerska royalty, and the popular girl. By Hillerska’s pecking order, her only male peer is the prince of Sweden. It’s what everyone (including her mother) expects of her, and it’s what Felice herself thinks she should expect. And, unconsciously, it’s an expectation Wille tries to fulfill.

But this dynamic naturally fails because Felice never really wanted to be a perfect princess, and Wille never cared for being a prince. They realize this and, through a shared rebellion against expectations, they become best friends.

Of course, Simon and Marcus don’t become best friends because Marcus is the archetypal 'nice guy' wrapped in a shiny red flag who never cared to know Simon or listen to a word he said.

I hope my review helps.  
  
From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working a full time job and having a life  
  
My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.  
  
My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.  
  
Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.  
  
What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:  
  
Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.  
  
No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",1,1735808494.0,LearnANewLanguage,0,1.0,False

Love is a topic that we've all pondered at least once (or maybe a thousand times). Whether you're binge-watching rom-coms, scrolling through sappy Instagram posts, or just navigating the highs and lows of your relationships, the question always arises—is love a feeling, or is it a choice?

At first glance, love seems like a powerful, uncontrollable emotion. You meet someone, sparks fly, your heart races—you're all in. That initial connection feels effortless, right? But what happens when the butterflies fade, and life gets...well, real? Does the love disappear, or is there more to it?

Here's the thing—love isn't just one or the other. It's both.



# The Emotional Highs of Love

When you first fall in love, it's exhilarating. You're drawn to your partner in every way imaginable. The long conversations, subtle glances, and unrelenting need to be near them feel magical. These feelings give love wings, but emotions are fleeting.

Over time, routine creeps in, challenges arise, and the passion of those early days mellow out. That's normal! Love isn't meant to stay stuck in its honeymoon phase but doesn't vanish either. Instead, it becomes something deeper, something you actively cultivate.



# The Power of Choice in Love

When emotions ebb, love becomes a choice—a decision to prioritize your partner and your relationship. Trust me, the work you put in during these times defines your connection's strength. Choosing love means showing up, even when it's hard.

Here's what choosing love can look like day-to-day:

🍃 Communicate, even when it's awkward or challenging.

🍃 Support your partner's growth, recognizing that relationships evolve.

🍃 Reignite intimacy by planning experiences that remind you why you fell in love.

🍃 Show empathy during conflicts and work with your partner instead of against them.

It's about the little moments—thanking them for the small things, asking how their day was, and finding time to connect even when life gets busy.



# Practical Ways to Nurture Love

Love takes effort, whether you're in a new relationship or have been together for decades. Here are a few simple ways to keep your bond strong:

1. Practice Gratitude – Show appreciation for your partner's efforts, no matter how small they seem.
2. Make Time – Whether it's a date night or just watching a show together, prioritize shared experiences.
3. Learn Their Love Language – Understanding how they express and receive love can make a huge difference.
4. Don't Fear Conflict – Arguments happen. Handle them with care, understanding, and patience.
5. Find Joy in Rituals – Daily habits like sharing coffee or texting ""good morning"" keep you connected.



# Back to the Big Question

The truth is love is a balance. It starts with a feeling—it sweeps you off your feet and transforms your world. But over time, it evolves into a series of choices. Feelings lay the foundation, but intentional acts of love are what build the house.

Now, I'd love to hear from you.

* Do you think love is more of a feeling or a choice?
* How do you handle the shift from passion to commitment in your relationships?
* Drop your thoughts below—I'm curious how others view this.

I'm planning on a 2,5-3month long trip through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia and I have a rough plan sketched out but would love to hear some feedback on possible detours worth taking, if I'm staying too long in one place and some general guidance of how to get between places. Also, is there anything in particular you'd suggest I book in advance? I'm guessing I really should book the entrance tickets for the Inca trail and Machu Picchu? Not loving the idea of creating hard deadlines in the middle of the trip.

If anyone has been to both the Amazon in Peru and the Pampas in Bolivia, I would love to know if you think it's worth visiting both or just one or the other.

I'm not on a tight budget, but of course there are limits. I'm mostly looking to experience cities/nature/food/culture with some smaller adventures sprinkled in. Might do a little bit of partying, but not a lot as my younger days are behind me (37M). I'll start traveling in March and the plan looks like this:

Colombia

1. Fly out to Bogota from Sweden, visit the a friend and explore the City.  
Estimating 4-5 days

2. Get to Medellin from Bogota, not sure if I should fly or take the bus. Explore the city and do a daytrip to Guatape.  
Estimating 4-5 days

3. Travel to Jardin from Medellin by bus and explore the town.  
Estimating 2 days

4. Travel from Jardin to Salento. Explore the town, hike Cocora Valley, visit coffee farms.  
Estimating 3 days

5. Travel from Salento to Neiva. From there, do a 2-3day round trip tour visiting Villavieja and the Tatacoa desert.  
Estimating 3 days

6. Travel from Neiva back to Bogota. This is so I can fly from Bogota to Galapagos, not sure if there is a better path but it seems like all flights go from Bogota.  
Estimating 1 day.



Ecuador

7. Fly from Bogota to Galapagos. Stay on an Island and do day trip adventures.  
Estimating 8-10 days



Peru

8. Fly from Galapagos to Lima. Explore the city and its famous foods.  
Estimating 3 days.

9. Fly from Lima to Iquitos and visit an Amazon eco lodge for a couple of days.  
Estimating 4-5days

10. Fly from Iquitos to Cusco. First two days are reserved for acclimatizing. Explore town, visit Sacred Valley, visit Rainbow Mountain.  
Estimating 4-5 days

11. Do the Inca trail. Any particular agency you'd recommend?  
Estimating 4 Days

12. Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu and then back to Cusco (need to pick up the main backpack that will be there).  
Estimating 1 Day

13. From Cusco to Ollantaytambo. Explore the town, stay a night and then back to Cusco.  
Estimating 2 days

14. Start travelling towards Bolivia, not sure which spots are worth staying at/seeing along this path headed to La Paz. Maybe Peru Hop is the way to go with a stop in Puno and Copacabana along the way?  
Estimating 1day



Bolivia

15. Explore La Paz  
Estimating 2 days

16. Doing this G-adventures tour to see Sucre, Potosi and Uyuni and back to La Paz. [https://www.gadventures.com/trips/bolivia-discovery/8926/](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/bolivia-discovery/8926/)  
11 days

17. Considering doing a tour to the Pampas from here.   
Estimating 2-3 days

I'm hoping to find my best friend and specially someone to connect with on multiple levels.

### Interests
- **Travel Enthusiast**: I have a deep love for travel and have been fortunate enough to do a bit. I can’t wait to go on my next adventure. Hopefully you’d be my travel partner.

- **Movie Buff**: Films are a window into other worlds and perspectives. There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good movie and then discussing it in-depth with someone who shares the same passion.

- **Social Butterfly**: I believe that life is best lived in good company. Whether it's a casual coffee date or a relaxed evening, I'm always up for socializing and making new connections.

- **Food Explorer**: Trying new foods is one of my greatest joys. I have a curious palate and love trying new food. From street food vendors to fine dining restaurants, I enjoy the full spectrum of culinary experiences. 

- **Board Game Aficionado**: There's something magical about gathering around a table with friends or family for a board game night. I enjoy a wide variety of games, from strategic games to cooperative adventures. 

### What I’m Looking For
I'm searching for someone who I can go out on cute dates with and is ready to embark on new adventures together. A genuine, kind-hearted, and open-minded person who values honesty, trust, and communication. Someone who appreciates both the thrill of spontaneous adventures and well planned trips.

Life can be an incredible journey, and I'm eager to find a partner who I can enjoy life’s joys with. Let's create memories, discover new passions, and enjoy every moment together. ",1,1735807581.0,vancouverdating,0,1.0,False

1hrpfrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardflaccidresearch/comments/1hrpfrd/hard_flaccid_story_venting/,Hard Flaccid Story / Venting,"Jeez... I'm never one to share on forums or even social media... only in sites like rateyourmusic or letterbox, but I guess I just need some help or somewhere to collect my thoughts. I've had this for about 2 years now, started when I was 26. There are a lot of things that I think contributed to my hard flaccid, poor masturbation habits, pretty much everyday with edging involved, are probably the root cause. I think the catalyst was starting to work a physically intensive overnight shift where I have to wear these boots that almost feel like heel, making my pelvic floor constantly tense. Coupled with the fact that I started taking finasteride, which does a number on boner health, and I think the result was hard flaccid. The first year wasn't too bad as I figured it would just go away with some time, healthy eating, and exercise. Somewhere after that first year, depression hit me. I honestly didn't know how shitty depression was until it hit me. I've always been a happy positive guy, heck most guys at work have asked me if I'm on something at how happy I am all the time. I love talking to people, meeting new people, love making people laugh, I love romance, I love music and collecting vinyl, I love movies, I genuinely love life... I could go on but you get it. Going from this to... and I'm not kidding not giving one single f@ck about any of what I mentioned before, and it's truly heartbreaking. I can't even cry about it lol... I mean, I can a bit, but it feels forced. I almost feel insane with severe mental fatigue, anxiety and depression constantly battling in my head. Like nothing makes me happy anymore, yet I am restless, anxious, and irritable at all times, even when being still. I am self-aware of this, so I try to mask at work, and god is it eating me alive. Especially when there are girls I'm interested in and are clearly hitting on me and playing eye tag while I'm over here trying to appear normal when I'm the longest thing from it. I can't even look at people in the eye anymore, I dont feel like me. It was worse when I had to  mask at home with my parents and sister there, but I have a great relationship with them, and they somewhat know that I'm not ok. I don't sleep well and haven't felt rested in about a year. The days all melt together, my memory is trash, and my eyes feel dead and tired.  Plus, due to the nature of flaccid, it's a constant reminder that your dick isn't working as it's always tense and sensitive. It's such a crazy downward spiral that I wish it was just hard flaccid I had to deal with. 

**What Ive done:** After hitting that wall, I had to get my ish together, so I decided to see a doctor. I got my blood work done, hormones checked, as I thought maybe fin had done something, and scheduled an ultrasound as there was a small lump on my testicles. The results came back perfect nothing wrong with me and the lump was a Hydrocele which I was told is harmless. This all took a while as I got these results about 5 months back. After this, I made an appointment with a urologist and cardiologist as I always wake up with my heart racing and even shortness of breath, although the latter happens very rarely. Unfortunately, the best doctors in those fields in my area are backed up and I have to wait till February for both appointments. But from what I've read online, there's not much they can actually help me with, but might as well get it done as it seems every case is so different for HF sufferers. In the meantime, I haven't masturbated or edged for a year now, but It's still annoying to have these painful semi hard flaccid boners randomly which most likely confuses my brain to what is happening, am I aroused... do I masturbate? Not to mention it's making my hard flaccid and those muscles tense up, and it feels like a never-ending cycle of triggers and inflammation. I stopped taking finasteride shortly after the first year. I eat lots of veggies, natural fats, oats, decent protein like chicken and steak, drink lots of water. I quit drinking coffee and stick to decaf tea as an alternative. I stopped eating spicy food and don't drink alcohol or smoke. For exercise, I mainly do calisthenics and run up to 15 to 20 miles a week at a light pace to not push my pelvic floor too much. I have heard conflicting info on running and its impact on the pelvic floor, but it's the only time I feel some sort of fire inside me and hope... add a good album and its honesty therapeutic lol.  Anyway, I don't do any crazy stretches as I have seen on here, just very basic stretches.



**Things to do or ""can't"" change:** Not including the urologist and cardiologist my dad swears by Chinese acupuncture, so I really want to find a good one, but idk where to look. I think a PT is also key, but it's so expensive. Lastly something I can't change due to well it's my job... is I continue to work the same physically demanding job with similar boots which looking at the heel is almost an inch and some change, add the insoles I had made to help with comfort, and it's almost 1.5 inches. I've tried a couple pairs of boots, but they all have that 1 inch to 1.5 inch heel. I know this isn't really talked about, but I'm on these things for 10 hours, walking 14k steps a day 4 days a week. Surely this could be contributing to pelvic floor tightness as I'm kinda on my toes putting more weight on my knees and hips... and I def feel it at the end of my shift. Lastly is MEDS I have tried my very best to stay away from any drugs or medications as I wanted to this naturally, but clearly I'm not doing too good. Sleep, depression, and anxiety which do meds do you think will be least invasive and which do I tackle first. I know SSRIs have some nasty sexual side effects and most of these drugs should be used short term... I just need some help getting back to being me... hopefully.

Haven’t been medicated since like May. Went to Italy over the summer for 2 weeks. Didn’t oversleep more than anyone else on the trip with me. Only hallucinated (sleep paralysis) twice on the trip. Maybe 3 times in all. For 2 weeks there, that was great since it’s usually almost every night for me. Was very strange experience since my narcolepsy symptoms were more maintained over there. Could’ve been all of the walking, how much I sweat, and better food quality. I’ve worked full time and actually maintained a part time job too, but had no time for myself and on my days off I would just crash. Drank a lot of coffee from Dunkin. I’ve gained a lot of weight though even though my diet has remained the same. I know it’s because my quality sleep is no longer there and I’m not getting the restorative sleep I need. Also might be all of the dunkin coffee I once didn’t drink on a daily basis before. I stopped drinking that and coffee rn. Just have been really tired so I’m going to try Relaxium Sleep and CBD gummies. Relaxium Sleep has GABA, L-Tryptophan, Magnesium and other sleep promoting ingredients like melatonin. I did take NyQuil when I was sick and it was like the best sleep of my life so if these don’t work I might take ZzzQuil instead. Apparently ZzzQuil is just Benadryl though and daily use of that is linked to Alzheimer’s but so is sleep deprivation. So lose lose situation for that. I’ll let you guys know how it goes though!

So many of my friends have bought houses. Big houses. I am renting with my partner and we live in an expensive area. We wanted to rent somewhere on the cheap end so that we had spare money to enjoy ourselves at the end of the month. 
Our flat is lovely and cosy but essentially it’s a room with a bedroom and bathroom. The kitchen is practically on our sofa. We can’t fit a dining table, and we can’t host anything as we can only fit one sofa in. 
All of our spare income so far is going on furniture and bits for the flat. 

I’m in a career I enjoy. I earn 37k but my pension is huge so my take home pay is relatively quite low (around 2100). £1500 goes straight on rent, bills and direct debits (such as my car and insurance, medical things, gym etc). I feel like i have no money to save. I have £1500 in a ‘savings’ account but nothing else and neither does my partner. 

I went on TikTok earlier and saw loads of people younger than me, with their huge houses and coffee stations in their big kitchens, or hosting dinner parties.
We also went to look for new sofas yesterday and I couldn’t help but feel resentful that we are limited to a certain length and I just felt useless. 

I’m 28 soon and thought I’d be further along than I am. I feel like we’re still finding our feet and we can’t afford to even think about family/marriage etc. I also have PCOS and am so worried about my fertility.

As I had some discount, I applied it, so the cost of each was pretty low (hers was just 1.70). After that, we went to watch a movie with her boyfriend and, while he did not ask for the money of the movies back, I texted him later to thank him and to ask him if it was OK for me to deduct the charge of her coffee from the movie ticket (which was just 5.50).

Her boyfriend, who happens to be my friend, told me he was OK, but also, that I did not have to pay him back, seeing I was being obsessed with money lately. I asked him why did he say that, and he told me that it was because of the coffee. I paid him back as agreed for the movie tickets discounting the coffee and told him I just wanted to be fair.

The next day, I met this guy for some drinks with a few friends and asked them how were we going to pay for it. He started shouting I was being obsessed with money once again and I just let it pass, as I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. I invited a round (even though some people did not, but I didn't feel forced either, so that's OK for me as it was totally my decision).

I really feel uncomfortable with both of them now. I don't want to be a greedy guy, on the one hand. On the other hand, I don't want to feel that I must invite someone because of the amount, especially as this friend of mine is not a super close friend and I have felt she's not been there at all for me, not making the same effort to meet me that I might do to meet her. It's not about money (I care about my money, of course, but I like to pay for what I consume, always), but about being fair. AITA?

If you’re looking to transform your home into a calming retreat or an inspiring workspace, embracing this color palette might just be the perfect solution.

### Why Choose Beige?

Beige is often seen as a neutral color, but it carries a rich warmth that makes it more than just a backdrop. Here are some reasons to consider this versatile hue:

- **Warmth:** Beige invites warmth, making a room feel cozy and welcoming.
- **Versatility:** This color pairs well with nearly every other shade, allowing for easy experimentation with decor.
- **Timelessness:** Unlike some trendy colors, beige stands the test of time, ensuring your space remains chic for years to come.

### The Boho Influence

Bohemian decor is all about expressing your personality through unique choices. Here's what makes it so captivating:

- **Eclectic Mix:** Boho style thrives on mixing patterns, colors, and textures. This creates spaces that are visually interesting and full of character.
- **Natural Elements:** natural materials such as wood, rattan, and plants aligns perfectly with the warmth of beige.
- **Artistic Expression:** Boho decor often includes handmade items, giving your space a one-of-a-kind feel that tells a story.

### Combining Beige and Boho

When you blend beige with bohemian elements, the results can be stunning. Here are a few tips to achieve a harmonious balance:

- **Start with a Neutral Base:** Use beige walls, furniture, or large textiles like rugs. This will create a peaceful backdrop that accentuates boho accents.
- **Add Colorful Textiles:** Layer with throws, cushions, or wall hangings in vibrant colors and patterns to create a playful contrast against the beige.
- **Incorporate Natural Decor:** Plants, woven baskets, and macrame details can enhance the bohemian vibe while maintaining a calm atmosphere with beige.

### Design Ideas for Every Room

Here are specific ideas on how to use the beige and boho combination effectively in different rooms:

- **Living Room:** Select a beige sectional sofa and layer it with patterned pillows. Add a jute rug and plenty of greenery for that boho flair.
- **Bedroom:** Begin with beige bedding. Then, include a tapestry or a gallery wall of eclectic art pieces for personality.
- **Office Space:** Choose beige cabinets or desks that keep the room feeling open. Contrast with colorful stationery and mystical art prints on your wall.

### Color Variations to Explore

If you're in love with the beige and boho aesthetic but want to explore further, consider these variations:

- **Warm Taupe:** Offers deeper warmth and pairs beautifully with earthy tones.
- **Soft Sand:** Delivers a sun-kissed vibe that works well with light fabrics and rustic decor.
- **Light Cream:** A brighter option that still captures the soft ambiance of beige while allowing other colors to pop.

Beige and boho into your space is about creating a balance between comfort, warmth, and personal expression. Whether you’re redecorating an entire room or just adding a few new accessories, this color palette allows you to curate a space that feels uniquely yours. Enjoy the process of weaving together textures, colors, and styles that resonate with your soul, and watch as your environment transforms into a haven of tranquility and creativity.

Tips for Incorporating Bohemian Elements into a Beige-Centric Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Combining bohemian elements with a beige-centric design can create a serene, inviting space. Beige serves as a perfect backdrop that enhances the warmth and eclectic nature of boho style. Below are some practical tips you can use to seamlessly incorporate bohemian elements into your predominantly beige design.

### Embrace Textures

The bohemian style thrives on rich textures. To infuse some bohemian flair into your beige-themed room, consider using various textiles. Here are some ideas:

- **Layered Rugs:** A jute or sisal rug works wonderfully against a beige floor, while adding a colorful kilim or Persian rug on top can provide depth and warmth.
- **Textured Cushions:** Use cushions in different materials like velvet, cotton, and wool. Opt for earthy tones or vibrant patterns to contrast with the beige base.
- **Throws and Blankets:** Drape a cozy woven throw or a fringed blanket over your beige sofas or chairs to invite comfort and bohemian charm.

### Incorporate Natural Elements

Nature is at the heart of bohemian design. Adding plants can enliven your beige space in a truly organic way. Consider these ideas:

Check die Details doch einfach mal hier ;)https://amzn.to/3VSOoll  
  
- **Potted Plants:** Choose a variety of sizes. Large leafy plants such as monstera or fiddle leaf figs can serve as striking focal points, while smaller succulents can be placed on shelves or tables.
- **Hanging Planters:** Use macramé hangers to suspend plants from the ceiling. This adds dimension and draws the eye upwards, enhancing your room's layout.
- **Natural Wood Accents:** Incorporate wooden furniture items or decor pieces that blend well with beige. Think about a reclaimed wood coffee table or wooden picture frames.

### Add Artistic Touches

Art is an essential component of the bohemian aesthetic. Displaying art pieces can create a captivating gallery feel while keeping it cozy. Here’s how:

- **Wall Hangings:** Hang woven wall art or macramé hangings to add visual interest and pop against the beige walls.
- **Paintings and Prints:** Look for colorful art pieces that feature bohemian themes, such as landscapes or abstract designs, to brighten your beige backdrop.
- **DIY Projects:** Consider making your own artwork or crafts. Simple canvas painting or dreamcatchers can reflect your personal style and uniqueness.

### Choose the Right Furniture

Furniture selections can have a significant impact on your beige and boho aesthetic. Here are some tips to choose the right pieces:

- **Mix Vintage and Modern:** Blend vintage bohemian furniture pieces with modern ones. A distressed wooden table paired with sleek beige chairs can create a balanced and interesting look.
- **Curved Shapes:** Opt for furniture with soft, curved lines rather than sharp, angular ones. This promotes a relaxed, inviting atmosphere that aligns with the bohemian ethos.
- **Unique Items:** Seek out unique, one-of-a-kind pieces from flea markets or thrift stores, such as an ornate side table or an upholstered pouf, to elevate your space.

### Incorporate Colors Wisely

While beige is neutral, adding subtle color can make your space feel more bohemian. Here’s how to approach color:

- **Accent Walls:** If you're feeling adventurous, paint one wall in a terracotta or olive green to create a backdrop for your bohemian elements.
- **Layering Colors:** Use colorful fabrics and accents, such as curtains or wall decor, to create dynamic layering against the beige hues.
- **Artwork and Decor:** Incorporate colored decor items to contrast beautifully with the beige, like vibrant ceramics or colorful artwork.

Combining beige and bohemian elements creates a harmonious living space that feels both relaxed and inviting. Using textured fabrics, natural elements, artistic displays, curated furniture, and strategic pops of color allows you to partake in a design journey that echoes your personality and embraces comfort. By following these tips, you can create a beautiful blend that feels unique and stylish while remaining true to both themes.

### Conclusion

The combination of beige and boho creates a visually stunning and inviting atmosphere in any space. This color palette not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of your home but also fosters a sense of calm and relaxation. The warmth of beige acts as a perfect backdrop, allowing the eclectic and artistic elements typical of boho design to truly shine. By carefully integrating bohemian pieces—such as textured textiles, layered rugs, and unique decor—you can enrich the beige canvas, making your space feel vibrant and full of life.

It leads to a lot of weird behaviours and I wonder if there's a way to help him?,"So long story short, his parents used a lot of corporal punishment on him, as well as psychological abuse. Fast forward to now he is basically scared of everything and basically presenting sometimes very odd behaviours, a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms.

I am a bit older and already went through my own therapy so I see some patterns in his behaviour that are unhealthy. I see that the closeness in relationship triggers him a lot.

I will give few examples.

I am already experienced IT professional and he asked me if I could teach him some basic Python. He has mechanical engineering degree and is super smart but coding is just not his thing. So we started with basics, I explained and asked him to make a small code. I kid you not, he spend like 6 hours in front of computer for those 10 lines. I was put grocery shopping and having coffee with a friend, came back and he was making all kinds of excuses to not show me the code. When I pressed him, he admitted he didn't get what I was explaining and said he couldn't finish. I saw his face and couldn't get why is he so scared to tell me this. It shocked me because I thought it was something fun to do, to learn from eachother. 

He apologises for everything. Like is he spill water on himself, drops a pen on the floor, laughs too loud. At some point this started to annoy me because those are most normal things in life, it doesn't require an apology. I asked him why and he said it's because his parents have beaten him all the time. I didn't take it seriously at that moment.

He is lying is some small things, like for example he goes to a small supermarket to get himself chips but he says he needs fresh air. Because he doesn't want to say he gets chips. This one drives me crazy because those are small things, completely unimportant.

If he makes ""big mistake"" in his eyes, like breaking a plate, his basically shaking from fear. I can see it on his face he's genuinely terrified of what's gonna happen.

I think I reached a point where I realised he needs help last weekend. We were in the kitchen, cooking together and the lid of salt shaker was not well closed so the whole container ended up in my stew. Basically whole pot was to be thrown away. It's a pity but not the end of the world, at least in my eyes. When I cleaned up, he said he is sorry, I jokingly said I will have to spank him and then all hell broke lose, he started crying. When he calmed down he admitted he was spanked for basically everything until age of 20 !!!! A lot to unpack.

I know his parents, they are also pretty mean. Mean to the point they really don't see it, it so natural for them. For example we were driving his parents to a family party and his father started to criticise my driving skills. I am an experienced driver, I did over 200k miles on my own since I had my license at 18 so I know what I am doing. After 15 minutes I pulled over and said that if he doesn't shut up, I will leave him alone in the middle of nowhere and he can walk. He was genuinely shocked that someone called him out on his bullshit.

So anyway, I am seeking advice what to do. Obviously a professional help but maybe some advice in day to day interactions?",2,1735806242.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I normally get about 3-4 hours sleep and then woken by bad zaps it’s normally just caused by saliva touching my teeth only on the right side of my bottom jaw.

1hrp5dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hrp5dj/there_is_something_wrong_with_me_and_i_dont_know/,"there is something wrong with me, and i dont know what to do. ","Im gonna write an essay here, and its going to be very long. so if you read it, thankyou.   
anyways, I really don't feel like talking to anyone in my life about my personal problems, that's why I've come on here to get thoughts from strangers.   
To put up all my problems up there, my childhood has basically been like, family issues, divorce, mum moves away I only see her once in 2-3years, dads always been alcoholic (and yk the troubles that comes w that) and i have two siblings who are older than me.   
when I was 11, I got a porn addiction, we also move towns then n i lost all my sports, hobbies, activeness and socialness. i fell down (I used to be loud, sporty, and those bitchy kind of girls, mean ones. i regret everything i ever did). my sister became distant then, sh, n dealing w her own problems. it's like that till 13 and that's when things go downhill even more. its just me and my dad n hes very angry. but he can also be loving and fun. im not gonna go into detailon everything hes done, but it's just been up and down severely. and its hard to hate him when hes also this good person who says nice things from time to time. i got pure o around 13, i felt guilty seeing porn, i became obsesed over avoiding sex, violence, and got intrusive thoughts of it all the time. every person i see is fucking or i think about violent things etc. you know how pure o works.   
i go into highschool and because the quiet shy ones. i get racist or snarky comments here and there and thats when i get into makeup and presenting myself ""better"". its amazing how pretty privilege works. i deal w pure o on and off. when im distracted at school its good and holidays comes by and its back. i had a good friend, and very good one, but i know its bad but for no reason id cut off people and get new friends and do it again and again. and i just ruin everything around me. and when someone asks me why? i genuinely dont know. i get annoying at people i spend too much time with and then i cut them off or be mean to them. with this i dont have any deep friendships. i join existing friendgroups who have bonds. and its not their fault and i dont blame them. its my fault. you might think this is stupid and honestly it is. w karma, i, me at fault lose all my friends. right now 3rd year of highschool ive got a friendgroup, theyre nice to me. last year theyd leave me out of things here n there but they were nice to me. im starting to get annoyed of them. ive got noone who will choose me first, noone whod check up on me or give me hugs. i know it sounds stupid. growing up i was poor as well, i wasn't that attractive, and i've always just wanted one things to be perfect in my life. i know theres so much i can be greatful for, a roof over my head and food to keep me full. but is it ungreatful to want one thing? like a good family, or money, or just be an attractive person, or have one good friend, boyfriend, or someone in my life i can rely on. ive always hated holidays such as birthdays, christmas/new years because of this. and i also miss my mum alot. i feel like a burden to her. she was stuck w my dad and never got to live her life because of me. she stayed longer because i, being the youngest, she had to take care of me. past years i've been telling people around me that i hate mental health awareness, and that its stupid, and that i dont care about friendships or deep meanings, and saying and acting like i had no feelings, emotions and i never cared about things. i'd push people away or be snarky to them in order to keep them away. and i cant stop doing that. i also have an obsession w social media and how people view me. i would look at my page relentlessly for HOURS. just looking at my profile, and when i posted myself recently i had a full on episode in my room alone, becausse i didnt like the way i looked in it now and people have seen it. people see me differently and not see me as, ""nonchalant"" ik this sounds stupid.   
I also feel like im not actually depressed or sad, becuase i dont/dont feel the urge to self harm and i have never gotten why people do that. i also dont want to kill myself and want to live. which makes me feel like im just an ungreatful brat, and an overdramatic person and its not a big deal. my family life was bad, but its not like i got hit, i dont have close friends but at least i have people around me, i dont have looks, but at least i was born ""normal"". things like that. i think im a miserable person, because even in a fun moment id think of something negative, like with my friends right now. we had a nye sleepover and night out and still i just thought of the time they left me out, and felt like i didnt fully like them, even when i was w them and laughing w them. they dont deserve this. i like them, but theres always this feeling/flashback. im so fake, and disgusting.  
i had my sister, we were close, my sister and I have always been so close, like back to back best friends kind of thing, and ever since our family life god bad, we've always had eachothers backs. she was like my favorite person, and still is. 

a little background on her is that she has always been a very secretitive person. she wouldn't tell me much about her life, or her friends (id know their names and little stories but thats it), she didn't like people in her room, she didn't like people knowing what she brought from stores, she didn't like people knowing what music she listened to etc. but she'd always tell me to do hauls or what i did or how was my day, and idk if this is because ive always been the louder one but yk.  
she moved out around a year ago and i'd text her almost daily, just basically annoying her w reels n tiktoks n stuff like that n ramble on bout my day and shed just reply or ignore for a day or so. even if i asked about her life it was brief and short. i also was not allowed to see photos of her, take photos of her or be in any of her social medias. even tho she followed me, knew what i was doing etc.   
around a over a year back she had an eating disorder, and struggled alot, she 'recovered' i think, I didn't really know bc she was, as i said, secretitive, and i think my dad 'helped' her or was trying and u could visibly see she didnt like i t. during then shed tell me how shes just naturally skinny, (she isn't, growing up she was always ""bigger"" than me. I was the lanky one and she was the well built one, in a goodhealthy way.) she also said that, i quote, ""dad thinks i have an eating disorder, but i don't, like thats not good for you."" but it was obv she did. she moved out and started to not throw it up but clearly was eating ver yless. she would avoid bread, rice, heavy foods, n started eating so much berries and drink excessive coffee/tea (idk if thats related or not but id like to know).  
recently in the morning we'd have bread or rice w smth n we had rice. we have three bowls, and i was planning on eating some for lunch as well. I put my portion on a plate, and went out for a driving lesson. she, put her bit of rice, and put it onto my plate. and i could tell she did because it was to the rim, and i dont eat that much naturally. i asked her ""did u put rice on my plate"" and she goes ""no?"" inthe lying tone, and i knew she was lying. i said okay and went back to my room n shut my door. ever since then we have not spoke to one another and she ignores my messages. also a note that when we had bread, she was eating bread and i was eating rice, because i prefeered it more, the bread wouldnt lessen. n shed make me these sandwhiches for lunch. (im assuming to get rid of breadn to not let it look like shes not eating any), and then i asked her ""r u eating bread?"" n she got very irritated.   
today she switched from bread to rice n eats such a small portion. whenever i say i skipped a meal or worked out alot she'd excessively tell me ""make sure to eat"" or ""dont work out too much its not good for you"". which really irritated me because why r u putting ur portion onto my plate, and telling me  to do this and that when u cant even do it yourself. I don't like how she makes me working out seem like a ""bad thing"", when she doesn't even eat.   
I think another reason i get annoyed that she doesn't eat is because i think that ""if she doesn't have to eat, then why do i have to"", or that its a angry caringness for her but idk which one it is.   
also a note that once my sister gets angry at smth she never lets it go, and can go without talking to that person for the rest of her life. I have watched her do it to others and i am kind of sad that it might be me next. I do miss the friendship we had, she was the closest person to me, but sometimes (i used to think, and still do now), wonder why she knew so much about me and my life and asked about it when she would tell me absolutely nothing about hers. I can't even see her photos or her socials.   
Why is she like this? and what should I do? Am I in the wrong? and if so, please feel free to criticize harshly and tell me things I can do to be a better person.   
I've lost the closest person i ever had in my life and i feel like its over. I'm so empty. I'd be surrounding myself with people who don't even know me, who won't ever choose me first in a room full of people, but for that moment it feels good. it feels good to pretend like i have the life, and im perfect. but when im in my room alone, and i have nothing to distract myself with i always think about everything i just wrote down, and it repeats in my head every night, and i end up crying myself to sleep.   
I think theres something wrong with me, and I think that I'm never going to get better, or be truly happy. I'll forever carry this feeling, and as long as I'm me, and remember every bad thing and choice I've done, I'll never love myself, and noone will ever love someone thats as miserable as me. telling myself that I did this to myself makes me feel slightly better, that i am horrible, and i deserve this. Even when someone holds me in their arms and tells me that they love me, and I can tell them anything I will never tell them everything, like I haven't said everything in this whole essay i wrote. But i genuinely wish for one moment where i'm truly happy, like for a day yk. i dont think about my past, negative things, i'm in the moment, im not worrying and i'm just simply happy. and i'll feel like i'm free

1hrp3b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1hrp3b3/i_hate_that_this_is_still_going_on/,I hate that this is still going on,"I used to post a lot about my ex/my feelings and how I was growing towards moving on, but it’s been a while but here I am again.

We were on and off (all because of her leaving and me allowing her back in) from June 2021 to August 2023, after having dated from March 2020 till May 2021. We went NC I don’t even know how many times throughout being on and off, but it was anywhere between 1-3 months each time it happened.

That was until she said she needed us to only be friends and I said I could never demote my feelings and desires from what they were. So we stopped talking, not an ounce of contact for 9 months. Until I got a tap on my shoulder in a local coffee shop one day as I was waiting for an order. It was like looking at a picture that I wasn’t supposed to see but I couldn’t stop looking. And guess where that went? We caught up over lunch, drive to a local beach, and continued to talk about what’s been happening. And then we laid together in the grass, I was holding her. I thought about how I literally expected to never speak to her again, and now she’s in my arms again. I knew I was going to get hurt but I kept going anyways. We went back to my car, wound up kissing, and later even more. It felt great to be honest. And over the next 4 months, things just felt normal with her again. I’d visit her in the city, occasionally sleep over, we’d go shopping or just walking, or watch shows and movies. 

It was what I wanted. But I wanted more like I always have, and when that conversation came up inevitably, it still ended the same. I asked her why. 

“Do I make you happy?” 

“Yes more than anyone else” 

“why can’t we just keep what we’ve had for the past months? We both loved it” 

“because I can’t date you” 

“Why not? Just why not??”

“because I still felt attracted and loved and comfortable, but just because those feelings didn’t change doesn’t change the fact that I knew it wasn’t right. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy it and my feelings weren’t there”

I will never understand why it wasn’t right other than you just didn’t want me, even though you showed me through those months that you wanted everything we had.  I did almost everything. Was your best friend, encouraged you to go out with your friends, I came to your shows, helped you with your cleaning and packing, made sure you always knew you could rely on me, always tried my hardest to leave you feeling good and satisfied, made sure that you were always loved even in your loneliest moments. Just to wind up with you telling me “I will never intend to date you”

I know it’s toxic and I’m moving forward with yet another bout of NC, but I just can’t stop being in love with you deep in my heart, and I really wish I could stop because thinking about this/you has been making me cry lately. I’m doing good moving on though, it’s been over two months this time, and this is my first ‘bad’ day, which is hardly difficult compared to bad days of years past.",1,1735805846.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False
1hrp1z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hrp1z3/my_nmom_is_a_horrible_person_shes_also_capable_of/,My Nmom is a horrible person. She's also capable of genuine kindness. I don't know what to feel anymore and it's killing me. ,"I have no life of my own. No autonomy whatsoever. I exist merely as a vessel for my mom and my other family members to exert their control. But she's the worst of it.

I'm 20 and still live at home with my parents. I have no job and take university online because leaving my cats would make make me more suicidal than I already am, so here I am, having to be subject to her abuse day in and day out.

This morning is what really solidified it, though. My mom was going on some rant about how I was going to be a failure if I didn't ""master AI tools"" for work, and was all ""starting today you're going to show me the AI progress you've made"". Like a fucking idiot, I told her no. I find AI to be stupid and unethical because of it's inherent theft and said that to her. She went batshit insane. ""AI is the future, you bitch. Do you want to be alone and miserable?""

That's about the solidifier of her decades long control and abuse. I have to do what she says. I have to listen to her. If I do it wrong, she insults me. Same if I do it right. If I talk back to her even as polite as I can, I get the worst of it even though my brother can say far more horrific things to her and not be told off whatsoever.

Even as far back as age eleven, she would do things like shoving her hand down my back pocket even though I told her multiple times how uncomfortable it made me feel, especially as we were in public. I ended up bumping into a lady and spilling her coffee and my mom got mad at ME for it. Or the times she'd touch my breasts unprompted, forcibly laser my body hair off since age 12- though I agreed to it happily because I was young and uninformed at the time, but still.

There was another incident where I was 13 and rejected her offers to buy me a bracelet, and she went crazy about how I was ""ungrateful"" and a horrible person, that I was a psychopath, and in the end I had to apologize to her. Or another incident at 16 where I told my cousin to stop talking to me rudely, but because her dad was there it was my fault and I had to apologize and was told by my mom ""yes, you are a bad person, we need to fix that."" Or another one within the week where my brother knocked my laptop to the floor and I was blamed and berated by her for sitting near him in the first place- but I was sitting there first before he even came in.

All this compounded is worse because in some fucked up, twisted way I still love her. I still need her. She was abused as a child and forced to marry my dad at 19, and even then he was abusive mentally, financially and sometimes physically, she had to beg and fight him to get a uni degree and when she got a job on her own, he and my extended family are still trying to get her to quit. She went through the same abuse as me so it's more painful that she does the exact same to me despite knowing firsthand what it did to her.

No, I don't wish her any ill will, I want her to be successful in life because truthfully what she went through was worse than what I had to deal with, even being subject to my tyrannical father.

She's nice and kind to me sometimes, and shields me from my dad's violence the best she can and is always stressing about how I can marry who I want (as long as he's muslim, but I'm ex muslim btw). One incident that stood out was my grandma trying to set me up to marry my cousin when I as 17 (we're pakistani so this happens a lot), and when my mom found out she screamed at her for 10 minutes about not letting her put me through the same kind of abuse she went through.

I'm trying to make a living off of writing to make my own money in my own way, though I have adhd and potential autism so this makes doing literally anything so hard.

Sorry, I just needed to vent. This may seem long winded but it's the first opportunity ive ever had to just write it all down.

I bought my first espresso machine 3 years ago : a Severin KA 5995 and a blade grinder. With no extra equipment and grocery store beans I’d pull more or less consistently tasty shots which I realize maybe were not « real » espresso.

After my machine broke down, I bought a Breville Bambino Plus 3 months ago and then a DF54. I then bought all the extra equipment to make it consistent : WDT, a scale, a dosing funnel, a tamping mat, a puck screen etc, and of course coffee from local roasters.

I have pulled 2-4 shots every day and I haven’t pulled a single one that was actually tasty. I’d go from bitter to sour to acidic. I follow all the online guides for dialing in, and it’s very discouraging especially when I see how people say « just got my first machine and after 3 shots of dialing in I pulled very tasty shots! ». It’s likely that I’m making a mistake somewhere and I just can’t figure out where. I can still return my machine and it’s more and more tempting with each bad shot. Maybe I should just get an aeropress and moka pot and be done with it. I don’t even remember how good espresso is supposed to taste like.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Maybe I just love the idea of espresso more than the actual thing.

The real solution is going to coffee roasters and trying each their espresso and see if there’s one I actually love. I’m in Paris so I have lots of options. But even then, could I replicate that at home? At this point I’m very doubtful.

Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading.",4,1735805640.0,espresso,5,0.83,False

I came to the religion in 2017 after my mother passed and for years have attended an Ile. At one point I felt and was pretty involved but throughout the years some dynamics in the ile changed, I felt like I was being pushed away and when I would ask about it I was told that it was in my head. I continued to show up despite feeling like I was always an outsider and tried to make friends. I would invite people to coffee or work out etc and would always be ignored, several times I tried to ask if we could start back up community outreach activities,  but also was ignored. 

It began to feel that the iles leaders only wanted people around who had financial success or prestige, many of our activities went behind a pay wall and the price of everything went up significantly.  I tried to speak with my Godfather a out this but again I was told that it's just in my head.

After about 3 years of trying I decided that this ile was no longer a healthy environment for me. I felt that I have been lied to and gaslit. I reached out again to my godfather and told him respectfully that I was going to step away completely from the temple although not ifa. I wanted to respect myself and find a way to move forward 

Just asking those our there if this has happened to you, and what suggestions you have? I really held on as long as I could and tried but it felt futile.
