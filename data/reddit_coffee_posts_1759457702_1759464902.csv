But there’s something in his editing that I really can’t stand, and I bet it’ll mess with you too once you notice it.

Most, if not all of Big A’s videos feature the “Wii shop channel” background music.  It is a fuckin bop, and it sets a good up-beat tone in his videos.  

That song has a really strong bossa-nova groove to it, and I can’t help but tap or dance along to it any time it’s on.  

BUT Atrioc doesnt actually have this song in his videos.  He has, what I must assume, is a version of the song where random out-of-beat chunks of the song have been sliced out.  
It ruins the rhythm of the song completely, and pulls my attention away from whatever he’s saying when these parts of the song happen.

Ill prove it, here’s a recent video:
At around 1:20, the song cuts back in.  
Just TRY to clap along for a bit without getting thrown off:

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1nwp9w4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwp9w4,[GF] Chapter 3: How it Feels to be Chosen,"Dati, I honestly thought love always had to be earned. Like you had to give and give, bend until you break, just to be seen. Just to be chosen.
It was exhausting, loving so hard and still ending up as “just an option.”

Then I met her. The funny thing is, we both came from hurtful pasts. She knows what it’s like to give everything and still not be chosen. I know what it’s like to settle for breadcrumbs, thinking it was love.

I think this is something us sapphics will understand: our pool feels limited. So when someone shows even just a bit of interest, we cling. Kahit na mali na. We abandon ourselves (our self-respect even!), we chase, we accept the bare minimum… just to keep the idea of love alive.

For the longest time, I thought that was normal. That love was supposed to be dramatic, unpredictable, full of highs and lows. Pero hindi pala ganun.

A few weeks ago, she came back to my city and stayed with me for a while, just so she could see my everyday routine. (Which is honestly just kape, kalat, and me pretending to be busy tapos kape ulit. 😂) 

When I picked her up at the bus station, I lost all composure mga sisxzt! I tend to be composed in public, but this time I was literally skipping and jumping to her like a kid, in my pjs pa kasi maaga un and kakagising ko lang. Hahaha. Even kuya konduktor laughed and said, “Si ma’am oh, excited!” And he was right. I was. Because this time, I wasn’t chasing love. I was running toward someone who already chose me. (Naks naman lover girl yarn!)

For our second monthsary, we kept it simple: we biked around hanggang sumuko mga kasu-kasuan namin, had a spa massage, and I cooked her a “romantic dinner” for the first time. It took me forever! By the time it was ready, pwede na siyang pang-breakfast. HAHAHA. But she looked at me like I was Gordon Ramsay (minus the shouting, syempre). That smile made all the stress worth it. And hey, I did not burn the kitchen down so double win!

The truth is, this chapter of us is very simple.
Cafe hopping. Netflix lang sa sala. Random tambay moments. Nothing extravagant. 

Because with her hectic life, I just wanted her to have slow, steady, satisfying days. The kind of days that don’t need grand gestures, just quiet joy. A cup of coffee shared in the morning. Sitting side by side while scrolling on our phones, yet still feeling connected. Laughing at Netflix shows until our stomachs hurt.

It’s simple, but it's worth so much more. Because for the first time, I don’t feel like I have to perform or over-give just to be loved. I don’t have to beg for affection or attention. Every moment with her feels full- full of presence, full of love, full of peace.

It’s the kind of love that doesn’t demand you to shrink yourself. 

What really gets me is, pag LDR mode na kami, she still makes time for me, even between her patients. No begging. No waiting hours for a reply. No anxiety. That’s when it clicked for me: when someone truly wants you, effort is not forced. It just flows, effortlessly.

And now I get it. Love is not supposed to drain you. It's not supposed to make you doubt yourself, your worth. It should feel steady. Mutual. Safe.
It should make you feel at home, not like you’re at a war zone all the time. 

For the first time, I can say this with my whole heart: I’m not just an option anymore.
I’m someone’s choice. 

And I hope she knows that she’s mine too.

1nwp6f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1nwp6f9/am_i_playing_favorites_with_my_friends/,Am I Playing Favorites With My Friends?,"A handful of recent experiences with my friends have got me wondering if I am making them feel unappreciated. For context, this all happened with a group of loosely connected friends whom all share the same interest. We often grab drinks, coffee, etc. either individually or in a group. FWIW, I’m male and all of these examples are with female friends. However, we are all 30+ in age and married to other people, so everything is strictly platonic.

First Time….
Was out to drinks with a group of friends and someone asked me if I knew a certain person(A). I said something to the effect of, “ Yeah, I’ve known her for years. She’s one of my favorite people.” And encouraged him to get to know her as she would be a good person to work with.

Another friend (F1) of mine who happened to hear my comment replied with, “She’s his second favorite.” 

Second Time…
Grabbed coffee with F2, whom F1 introduced me too. She randomly asked me about the same person (A), and I said essentially the same thing. “I’ve known her for years, she’s a good friend and one of my favorite people.”

F2’s response? “Does that mean you like her more than F1 and me?”

Third Time…
Chatting with a third friend (F3) and she mentioned that F1 had reached out to her to ask for her opinion on something. She knew F1 and I were friends and she remembered that I had tried to introduce the two of them a few years ago. Again, I said something to the effect of, “She’s one of my oldest and closest friends” and that I was glad that the two of them would finally meet.

F3’s response? “Are you saying she’s a closer friend than me?”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

	•	Two young women are roommates and friends. One of them disappears under suspicious circumstances.
	•	The roommate who’s left behind finds a note/letter in the missing friend’s room. The police are hesitant/unhelpful about searching.
	•	The book is told in multiple POVs (switches between characters).
	•	In the first few chapters we see the missing friend earlier that day: she visits a small coffee shop / restaurant, meets a young man who is a food deliverer (he drops off food for an elderly lady on the request of his boss), then she sits on a swing. Those scenes happen very early — that’s where I stopped reading.
	•	Tone felt like contemporary women’s fiction / domestic mystery (could be YA or adult).

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/542ags/my_20f_boyfriend_23m_announced_my_mental/)  **Sept 23, 2016**

I have a well controlled mental condition that I am very private about. I take two separate medications twice a day (every 12 hours) and for the most part it does not affect my daily life. Luckily I have a fantastic doctor who worked with me to experiment with medications until I found a combination that worked for me with minimal side effects. I'm just saying this to demonstrate that this is not a significant issue in my life anymore and it is not necessary for many people to know.

I started dating my boyfriend almost a year ago and he has been great, just a little dopey. He is not a subtle person and can't keep a secret to save his life. So even though I told him before we started dating that I have this condition that is well controlled and I don't really like people to know about it, he went ahead and told his parents. I was pissed but told him not to tell anyone else and we got through it.

Well last weekend we went to a friend his' party and while they all got drunk, I sipped on a soda. Many of his friends were concerned that I wasn't drinking and kept saying stuff like: ""it's ok that you're underage. You can still have a beer. Want me to make you a cocktail?"" I was starting to become uncomfortable with the comments when my boyfriend, in his infinite wisdom, decides to announce: ""Oh she's not drinking because it affects her medication."" Okay..well now I'm pretty pissed but whatever, no one really mentioned it further.

Well then a little but later my alarm goes off and my boyfriend, who is drunk by now, literally yells to me: ""Hey babe, it's time to take your crazy pills."" He turns to the other people and goes, ""yeah she has (condition) and has to take pills for it."" I just stared at him.

I could not believe that he would do this to me. I just met some of these people and now they all know something incredibly personal about me that is nobody's damn business! I hate, I hate the way people treat me after they find out. Like I'm unhinged or damaged or something. I don't want anybody's pity. Its fucking well controlled for christs sake!

I grabbed his keys and went to the car, and he followed me, asking what was wrong. I didn't say anything, just drove us home and I haven't really talked to him since even though he's been apologizing profusely. Is this something I can even forgive him for? Should I? What should I do here? Seriously I'm so upset and angry. He had no right.

**tl;dr:** My boyfriend announced my private mental condition to a party full of his friends. I'm considering leaving him.

[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55ripi/update_my_20f_boyfriend_23m_announced_my_mental/)  **Oct 4, 2016 (11 days later)**

So I wasn't going to update but a couple people asked me to so I decided I would.

Before I went back on Saturday to get my stuff I texted my ex to let him know and said if he wanted to talk that would be the time to do it. He said ok. But when we got there he wasn't there. So we packed everything up and I officially moved back home. He tried reaching out to me via text a couple times but I told him I was really hurt he decided not to be there (I guess I still kind of wanted to salvage things) and that I had nothing more to say to him. I blocked him to resist temptation.

Now the exciting part of the update! I had gotten a FB request from one of our mutual friends who was also at the party. She told me that she thought my ex was an ass for what he did and told me that she had GAD and would kill her boyfriend (who was also there) if he was ever pulled something like that. We had a long and nice conversation and she invited me out to the movies with her boyfriend and his brother.

I went and guess what? His brother and I totally hit it off. He's pretty shy and I didn't realize it then but I guess they we're trying to hook us up? Anyway I'm not sure how I feel about dating a guy younger than me. He's 19 and turns 20 in December. But who knows? It hasn't been long since we broke up though so if we do get together it probably won't be soon but as of now I have a coffee/study date with him for next Friday! (:

Thank you for everyone who commented on my original post, you may not have known it but everyone sharing your stories really helped me, and kept me strong when I wanted to text him every night!

**tl;dr:** I gained a new friend after I broke up with my ex and they tried to set me up with her boyfriends brother who is very nice. Maybe we'll end up dating. Who knows?

I really really loved this sweater, it was smart-casual with a striped pattern from a fancy Italian brand. I could wear it to work as well as for an evening out and I really liked how I looked in it. I'm really really pissed to lose it. 

Background on the relationships. My girlfriend is Hannah, we met because we live on the same street and we used to have our pre-work morning coffee at the same cafe, our coffee meetups slowly turned into dates and we've officially been a couple for about 6 months, I like her, she's sweet and smart and pretty. But we are taking it slow since both of us were coming off of terrible breakups.  

She broke up with her fella of 10 years, their relationship ended in a hail of fights and petty behaviour which tore apart their friends and pissed off their families, the reasons were never clear to me, all Hannah said was that all their relationship problems came up at the same time and everything unravelled.

My break-up was kinda different, Haley and I never officially dated, but we had been friends for a very long time, we slept together once when we were both between relationships but we were both sure that we worked better as friends. 2 years back, Haley broke up from a bad relationship and we got into a semi-official FWB situation, i.e., we would still hang out and talk as friends but once in a while we'd also have some form of physical intimacy. Both of us also got really busy with our careers so we never really had any other romantic relationships. Around Christmas 2015, Haley brought up our relationship and told me that she was falling for me as more than a friend and wanted to explore a relationship with me, I didn't. I had my own reasons, mainly that we had some fundamentally mismatched views on life that would make a relationship really hard, we worked really well as friends and she was really important to my life and I didn't wanna jeopardise that by getting into a relationship. Well, I still lost that friendship. She essentially went no-contact and no matter how much I hated it, I couldn't really say much since it was a reasonable thing for her to do for her own sake. But it really hurt, losing her as a friend hurt way more than any break-up I've ever had and it took me a while to find my footing. 

Hannah knew the basic details about mine and Haley's relationship and wasn't too curious about it. She also knew that I had a few things that Haley had given me but never raised an issue about it especially since she had a bunch of gifts from her ex as well. 

This Christmas, I accompanied Hannah to her office Christmas party, to my surprise Haley was also there. Turns out, that she started working there recently at a different department from Hannah's. We exchanged pleasantries and tried some small talk, but it was awkward and lasted maybe 3 minutes most of which was silence, then Haley left early and I didn't see her again. While I talked to Haley, Hannah was somewhere else and when she came back I told her about it. She had never met her before (big company), but her curiosity was piqued. In any case I got into a jovial party mood and everything went back to normal. 

Until last Friday. When I was at work, I got a flurry of texts from Hannah basically stating that she finally met Haley. Now you should know that Haley is really attractive, like modelling offers since she was 16 attractive, plus her job also means that she's always dressed to kill (event manager for high-end corporate parties). Well seeing Haley did a number on Hannah, she didn't come out and say it but she suddenly got extremely curious about Haley as well as our relationship, with a lot of questions about everything. She even specifically mentioned the sweater, saying 'no wonder you love that sweater so much'. I tried my best to assuage her insecurities. I told her that there was absolutely nothing between Haley and me, we haven't' even talked to each other in more than a year, except for 3 awkward minutes during that party. I also told her that I really liked her and could see our relationship going pretty far. But, I was also lowkey annoyed with the whole conversation. Anyways, Hannah slept over Saturday night and I thought we had gotten somewhat past this momentary burst of jealousy, then she left early on Sunday morning saying something had come up  even though we had plans to spend the day together. In the evening i was going through my laundry and I saw the sweater with a big hole in the armpit like someone had tried to literally pull it apart with their bare hands. Now it's obvious that it was Hannah's doing. I had worn that sweater on Thursday and when I put it aside for dry-cleaning it was fine, no one else had come to my flat since then. I texted her asking about it directly, may have not been the best tactic but I was incredibly pissed off. She was on the defensive from the get-go, denying that she did it, coming up with various ways that could have happened and continuously telling me that I was an asshole for thinking that she was crazy like that. Today morning she texted me all pissed and curt and told me that yes the provenance of the sweater bothered her, but she didn't do it. 

I think I need to dump her. But, I've been second-guessing myself a fair bit as well. Hannah has always been really sweet and is very caring and sensitive about my feelings, I really like her and we don't have any fundamental differences, we can genuinely have a good fulfilling relationship and maybe this ripping up a sweater thing was just a momentary lapse of judgement which she is extremely embarrassed about and hence her defensiveness.

What do you think? 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: GF of 6 months ripped up my favourite sweater, that I got from an ex. Ex is GF's colleague and she just met her leading \to a bout of questions and some insecurities. She denies ripping up the sweater. I'm second guessing whether it's a break-uppable offense or not.

Since it's been 10 days and the matter has been settled in a satisfactory manner, I thought I'd update you guys as to the final conclusion. I've had a few pints, so forgive the disjointedness.
FAQs

* It was a Loro Piana jumper. It's not repairable, I asked around.

* My evidence for knowing that Hannah was the culprit is circumstantial, but compelling. Firstly, after I put it in the pile meant for dry cleaning, it was covered by a bunch of other stuff, when I discovered its tattered remains it was bunched up in a ball on top of the pile. Secondly, the tear was 8 Inches/20 cms long, something I would have noticed quite comfortably if it had happened while I was wearing it or while I put it in the laundry pile. Thirdly, while it was torn it was also stretched completely out of shape, the stretching would be consistent with someone grabbing two sides of it and pulling it apart. But most convincingly, when I confronted Hannah (aggressively, I admit) she started telling me about all the alternative ways in which the damage could have happened with exact knowledge of the type of damage that my poor jumper had suffered, I had never mentioned the type of damage (namely that it was in the armpit area along the seam along with the stretching).

* To the lady who sent me a very heartfelt and foul-mouthed rant/plea- Yes, I think people have every right to feel insecure/inadequate. Yes, people have every right to act like an idiot. Yes, I have done stupid things due to my lack of control over my emotions. And yes, I'm weird/materialistic enough to love a jumper more than the woman I'm dating. But No, I don't think she deserves my forgiveness for this slip-up, and that is because it wasn't the insecurity, it wasn't the lack of control and it wasn't the materialism that made me want to break-up, it was the lying and deceitful manner in which she behaved afterwards. It was the insanely manipulative way in which she turned herself into the victim and demanded an apology from me, and yeah the cursing directed at me didn't help.

The story is fairly dramatic as well as anti-climactic. Her curt behaviour after my ill-fated confrontation lasted for 2 days. Then she called about 40 times to beg me for forgiveness, even though I avoided the calls I did hear the VMs' and my empathy was piqued, she also pretty much admitted to her guilt in some of those VM's. But then I also came to know that preceding those calls, she had lashed out towards Haley (my ex-friend/FWB) at their workplace and that it was ugly as well as had potential to spiral negatively for her career. That made me feel really ba, for Haley. She didn't deserve to be dragged into drama that she played no active role in.

The anti-climactic part is that I didn't even have to break-up with Hannah. She has essentially moved in with her parents up north, she sent me a message through a mutual acquaintance stating that she realises that she has quite a few issues she needs to handle from her break-up with her ex-fiance and our decision to date was pretty much doomed from the start. I wished her the best of luck with her journey.

Another mutual acquaintance approached me, this time one between me and Haley, she sent word apologising for her role in my relationship meltdown, I told her that there was nothing to apologise on her end, I also asked for her forgiveness for inadvertently causing workplace dramatics. And that's that.

Thank you for your words and brickbats. It was enlightening, entertaining and infuriating.Interesting combination for sure, but then that's why one turns to random internet strangers for advice.

**tl;dr:** It was Hannah. We broke up. She's gonna work on herself.

Looking for a part-time full time or some kinda gig related to welding (or something metal and blue collar related) I like welding and want more practice ( and an excuse to not be at home). Though I do have other skills and likes.

I love all animals so dealing with them is a joy for me

Likes coffee and chill atmospheres so I don't mind cafe's. I have forklift and wearhouse experience so I don't mind that if I'm using powered equipment.

I would like to find a job that has a shift starting at 5pm for weekdays and if it's a weekend only job I can work any hours.

Weather you need some help with a project and need a welder or a extra set of hands (no plumbing) I would love to hear from you.

BTW

*I'm a black guy I'd that's relevant (idc about politics just work)

*I applied to a union and plan to apply to another but that takes time and having some extra experience gets me a lil headstart when I join one.

*Job applications never really work well and the ones that do wants first shift or 10+ shifts (a big no no I'm in college fulltime and want rest) also finding a job in general rn is hell

*I have my own car and don't mind driving a bit. If it's a traveling thing hopefully we can work something out.

*Want something more than $18/hr

*This is just me casting another line out so there's not really TOO much of a rush

*If the new job is going to replace my current part time job at Lowe's then give me two weeks to give my notice before starting

*I have a resume ready 

*No heavy food service jobs I don't want something so mentally taxing. But like a said cafe's are fine. Small restaurants too. Just no Applebee's, Fish market, consession stands etc

*I have a few tools of my own for welding and willing to buy some more. Just not the machine because I can't carry it around.

*Im picky about my job types because I'm loyal and value my sanity about all else. I enjoy working so finding a job that I don't mind being at is a must because I don't need more stress in my life (a chill job actually gets rid of some of that for me.)

*I have long hair and won't cut it.

*Obviously willing to be trained in something

*Mild mannered and keeps to myself. I work better alone but doesn't mind working with a  dependable team. I have experience doing so and depending on the job it's obviously better to be in one.

*I'm 5,9 150lb and can consistently lift 70+ lbs

*NO furniture moving jobs god please 

Feel free to comment dm or whatever. It can be about an job offer, a tip/advice, or to chat idc just hope to hear something.

I've been using different types of mug warmers for years now, and I thought I'd share my experience to help those who are struggling to choose between portable mug warmers and instant warmers.

Let's face it - there's nothing worse than taking a sip of your coffee or tea only to find it's gone cold. I used to microwave my drinks multiple times a day until I discovered mug warmers, and they've been a game-changer for me.

After trying both portable and instant warmers, I've found that each has its own advantages. Portable mug warmers are great for travel and office use. They're compact, usually USB-powered, and can keep your drink at a consistent temperature for hours. I recently got this awesome one from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer that's been absolutely perfect for my desk setup.

However, instant warmers work differently. They heat your drink much faster but typically need to be plugged into a wall outlet. They're more powerful and usually have temperature control settings, which is great if you're particular about your drink temperature.

Here's what I've learned from using both:

Portable Mug Warmers:
- Perfect for office use
- Usually cheaper
- More portable
- Battery-powered options available
- Gentler warming process
- Takes longer to heat

Instant Warmers:
- Faster heating
- More temperature control options
- Usually more expensive
- Needs constant power source
- Better for home use
- More powerful heating element

For me personally, I prefer portable mug warmers for everyday use. They're more practical and versatile. The one I mentioned earlier from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer has been especially reliable - it's got a great design and keeps my coffee at the perfect temperature without overheating it.

That said, if you primarily drink beverages at home and want quick heating, an instant warmer might be better for you. It really depends on your specific needs and lifestyle.

One important tip: regardless of which type you choose, make sure your mug is compatible with the warmer. Some ceramic mugs work better than others, and metal mugs might not work at all depending on the warmer's technology.

Bottom line: both options are way better than constantly microwaving your drinks or letting them go cold. Just think about where you'll use it most and how quickly you need your drinks heated before making your choice.

Have any of you tried either type? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments!",1,1759463276.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Why did the universe put you in my path if I couldn't have you? Why? WHY?! It is unfair how you shattered my world with only one lingering look. It is devastating to know that I will not see you ever again, that I will not hear my name in your voice or ever know how soft your hair is, how warm your hands are, or how it feels to be pressed against your chest. You took something from me that I will never get back, and still I cannot get mad at you. So many questions will remain unanswered forever.

My heart feels heavy tonight, your reply so polite, yet absolute. I wish that at least I could have told you, over a quick coffee, blushing and feeling ridiculous after, but at least it could have brought me a little sense of closure. And of course —silly me— I will keep a bit of hope that if you ever change your mind you will reach out for me, remembering the girl from the other side of the world that was so eager to see you. Or perhaps destiny might give me some kindness and put us in the same place and time again like it did almost a year ago. Would you understand then how it feels? Would you remember me after a while once I faded away? 

Maybe I always knew my fragile dreams would be broken by you

How will I be able to move on from this when I still will be crossing the earth in November? How long will it take me to calm this beating that whispers your name in my heart? Will I ever? If I could ask for a wish, it would be to have one more chance to see you again and just share a knowing smile. And then I will know that you finally know.

I've gone on and dated before. Lately, I've found that I do really well with finding people online more than in the wild. Maybe because I find it easier to be myself, maybe I enjoy a little mystery. *Maybe* it's just more fitting into my life over meeting in person right away. Who knows? I like keeping both options open. 

I'm a pretty self-sufficient, independent person. Sometimes I get a little sad about it when it's been a long day, I'm starving, have a dog that still needs to be walked, and I'm so desperate to wash my day away. Those are moments I sometimes wish I didn't have to do everything all by myself. Other times, I take a photo of my breakfast, find it so incredibly picture esque, and wish I had someone to think of that I'd share the picture or even my breakfast with. 

I think overall I have my shit together, I'm looking for same. I'm looking for someone who wants to see me, know me, and see me fitting into what's already working for them and vise versa. I'm a big fan of ""I'll work on me for you, and you work on you for me."" 

Things I love: food, cooking, reading, self-improvement, anything hands-on/artsy (I've been working on sewing lately!). Walking around outside, going to an art show, or comedy show can be up my alley when I'm feeling more outgoing. Thrifting, the occasional matinee and some coffee can do me wonders more frequently. 

I'm half Mexican, half Italian. I've been really trying to find my place and love for my cultures on my own. Being mixed and 2nd Gen often has me feeling out of place most of the time and bit fraudulent when I try. I'm trying to shake off  the latter, however. 


If you appreciate the things I enjoy, have your own things you love, mean what you say, can respect some self depreciation and sarcasm and food pic or two. Then, write me. You might be just what I'm looking for.

1nwopsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nwopsv/fall_wreath_vs_floral_arrangement_which_fits/,Fall wreath vs floral arrangement: which fits better?,"Hey there! I've been decorating homes for quite a while now, and I wanted to share my thoughts on something that's been on my mind lately - the eternal debate between fall wreaths and floral arrangements.

Last weekend, I was helping my sister decorate her new house for autumn, and we spent hours discussing which would work better. After trying both options, I've got some interesting insights to share.

Let's talk about fall wreaths first. I recently discovered this amazing collection of fall wreaths (https://athometouch.com/fall-wreath) that totally changed my perspective. What I love about wreaths is their versatility - they're not just for doors anymore. I've seen people use them as centerpieces, wall decorations, and even as window accents.

The thing about fall wreaths is that they're incredibly low maintenance. Once you hang them up, they're good to go for the entire season. Plus, they're usually made with artificial materials that look surprisingly realistic these days, so you don't have to worry about wilting or replacement.

Now, floral arrangements are beautiful too, but they come with their own set of challenges. Fresh flowers need constant care, water changes, and they don't last nearly as long. Even though they bring that natural touch and amazing scent to your space, they can be quite demanding.

From my experience, if you're looking for something that's both practical and stunning, fall wreaths are the way to go. I actually just ordered another one from here (https://athometouch.com/fall-wreath) for my dining room. The best part is you can store them and reuse them next year, making them a smart investment.

But here's the thing - it doesn't have to be an either/or situation. I've found that mixing both can create an amazing fall atmosphere. Try hanging a wreath on your door and placing a small floral arrangement on your coffee table. The combination can really bring your autumn decor to the next level.

One tip I've learned: when choosing either option, stick to warm fall colors like deep oranges, rich browns, and golden yellows. This creates a cohesive look that screams autumn without being too in-your-face about it.

What's your go-to fall decoration? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments below!

So roughly a few months ago, I was at work, on the sales floor. I'm doing my thing when a male shopper (I say Instacart in the title but I'm not sure what shopper platform he was using as he was dressed casually with no company signage on his person) shows me his phone screen and asks me for help finding an item for an order. As soon as I help him out, he asks if I would like to grab coffee sometime? I say I'm not single and I go on my way.

I respect someone trying to shoot their shot so I didn't really think much of it after. A few weeks later, I'm at a Petco buying pet food on my day off, and I see the same male Instacart worker being assisted by the only cashier by the registers, who was a woman. He appeared to be picking up an order and was talking to her. After he left, she rang me up, but she told me he asked for her number! I was immediately a little suspicious of that and told her about how he tried to ask me on a date while *I* was at work so she was aware of that. I told her it was a little odd. (I'm not sure if she gave him her number and I didn't think to ask.)

Fast forward to today, and I'm at work again, doing my thing on the sales floor when a *different* male Instacart shopper (also in casual clothing with no company signage so I'm still not sure what platform he was using) shows me his phone asking me where an item was. I helped him out and then he asked me if I was single?? The real confusing part this time was that I was wearing a mask as I've had my ass kicked by a nasty flu twice in this latter half of the year and I do NOT wanna miss work again. I also was wearing no makeup at all and I am not supermodel material lmao. I told him no and went on my way.

Both the female cashier and I were on the younger side (I'm 30 but I've been told my entire life that I look younger for my age) and both males were also younger looking, maybe late 20s/mid 30s? This all happened in the Citrus Heights area.

I'm currently writing a serial, and probably when I finish it, I'd like to work on a fiction I had in mind for a ling time. Its more like a series of novels. 

Digging though here and other places I learned that trad. Fantasy can have some traction on RR but what's more popular is litrpg, cultivation, etc.

We all know whats meta, whats not and all that stuff that geind our gears, Right? Not complaining.

I was thinking though, and maybe Im dumb to think thats easily done, if would be a good idea to have a way to catalong the site stories by the type of piece it is.

Let me explain: we have genres (4 to chose) and tags. With this we can twll readers the type of story we are writing. Thats perfectly fine.

But how about a kind of 'master' tag of what the story is. A sole tag for each story cataloguing if its a webserial (king format with arcs...), a novel/novel series (3 act structure of sorts), a lightnovel, sort story (this is in genres now ik), etc. 

This, and then maybe some option to cgoose in main page, could organize all the lists and filter by type of story. It would give visibility to other stories  that otherwise are burtied by nore popular ones. (Ex; This master tag would make lists like rs for only, as example, novel or LN)

I know the place is basicly for webserials, but we, who like other formats, exist too.

Also it may be a plus to atract new authors/readers that like other type of formats. +And, no worries, we can still trash harem, romantasy and nakama bs like before.)

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1nwoaj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nwoaj5/my_friend_20m_is_sending_me_21f_mixed_signals/,My friend (20M) is sending me (21F) mixed signals again?,"I met my friend 3 years ago when I was dating my now ex and he was dating his girlfriend at the time. We quickly ended up each other’s confidant when he and his girlfriend broke up and I had struggles with my boyfriend. 

After a particularly bad fight with my ex my friend told me I should break up with him. Around the same time he had started casually comparing me to his ex. I was skeptical and had a conversation with him basically asking him if he liked me. He said no and we brushed it off like nothing happened.

Fast forward a year (I am still with my ex) my friend ghosted me for a couple months. I finally got him to meet me for coffee and we talked for a bit and he admitted that he thought that I liked him. Which I found a bit odd because I was head over heels for my boyfriend at the time and still was during this conversation. 

A couple months pass and my ex finally becomes my ex (ended on good terms). I go through a questionable phase, as most people do, after a long term relationship ends and my friend helps me through my stupid decisions. (And convinces me to stop making said stupid decisions…)

Finally getting to recent events I had a conversation with him two months ago where he tells me “Yeah, I’m happy to be single but I feel like it would be nice to have somebody. Although I don’t want it to be someone from my work so you’re the only person who fits that.”
I found this a bit off putting but it put the thought in my head.

I ignored this brushing it off as an odd comment, but recently he has become more touchy. (Important to note this does not make me uncomfortable I just wish I knew the intent). He has started nudging me more than he used to in conversations, kind of play fighting when we go on walks, and resting his head on my shoulder.

All of this makes me very confused and our friendship has always been a bit odd. I can’t tell if he’s just more comfortable around me now, or if there is something more happening here… I want to ask what his intentions are, but we have had that kind of conversation before so it feels weird to bring up again.

TLDR: My friend who I have a complicated friendship with has started becoming more touchy than he used to be and I don’t know what to do.

Do I ask him about the mixed signals or wait and see what happens?",1,1759461499.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1nwo9ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterCollege/comments/1nwo9ku/is_there_any_ultimate_purpose_of_the_human/,is there any ultimate purpose of the human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1759461417.0,HunterCollege,0,0.33,False

Feels like everyone around me is moving on with their lives, and honestly, I’m not totally sure where I’m headed next. I’ve been single for a while (like ever since tbh lol) and I usually love my independence, but I’m starting to get curious about what happiness through new connections might be like. So here I am, open to meeting new people and seeing what happens!

 Having said that, would you be down to hangout with me this weekend? My treat! I’ll be coming from Makati.

About me:

- Works in the corporate (Finance)

- Nocturnal but trying to work on my body clock


- Loves reading, watching anime, and stargazing. Saving right now so I can buy a decent telescope haha.  I do cook for fam and friends sometimes. And oh, big fan of horror movies too.


- Just got back to the gym and play badminton with coworkers or friends whenever I get the chance.


- Homebody but I’m usually out at night, doing long walks. There’s just something peaceful with it.


- Hmmm shy at first, but once I'm comfortable, I talk so much that my sister sometimes considers investing in earplugs.


- Prefers milk over coffee


- Feels weird to describe myself physically but let’s see. Hmmm I stand 5’4, chubby but normal BMI (23-24), fair complexion, a bit chinita, medium long wavy hair, and I wear glasses


- I’ve been told that I look younger than my age. Beauty is subjective so I really couldn’t tell; I think I look simple but decent. Feel free to rate me when you see me in person, won’t take it to heart lol 
 
 

About you:
 

- Please be around my age


- Understands that this is purely SFW

1nwo90r,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nwo90r/final_notice_to_vacate_my_head/,Final Notice to Vacate My Head,"AA,

This is your official eviction notice. You’ve lived rent-free in my head for more than a year, but consider this your final three-day notice to vacate.

I’ve kicked myself a million times for casually calling what we had a “situationship” when I didn’t even understand what that meant. That was my mistake. Because it wasn’t a situationship. It mattered, at least to me. And maybe that’s why you ghosting and blocking me without any real explanation hit harder than I want to admit.

You’ve lingered in my mind with your feet up on the coffee table ever since. Even while I went through the motions of going out on more than ten first dates (and a few seconds). Even while I fell in and out of love with someone else.  You were always there in the back of my mind.  I’ve reread our texts, replayed our videos, and tried to decode your Spotify playlists like they could tell me what your silence never could. And all I’ve got to show for it are unanswered questions.

I can’t keep carrying you as an unpaying tenant. I’m sad about it, but this unrequited attention has to end. Possession of my thoughts needs to revert back to me.

I hate how things ended, and I doubt I’ll ever understand. So pay up (you owe me at least an explanation) in the next three days, or vacate.

Goodbye, weirdo.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

It’s anything more than just gum.","# Okay, so you know how everyone talks about the ""chewing gum trick"" for acing exams? For me, I’ve been chugging coffee since day one of studying this stuff, and I think that’s actually the real secret. I realized the trick isn't even about the gum itself, it’s about this weird psychology thing called ""context memory."" Basically, when you're grinding through homework or notes, your brain doesn't just save the information, it saves everything else too, like the smell of your room, the taste of a specific energy drink, or the background music you were listening to. When you take the actual test, if you can bring back that specific sensory situation, it acts like a shortcut, almost like a password that unlocks those memories that are related.

This means you can use literally anything you do habitually while studying as a memory cue. For me, it's that specific burnt taste of the black coffee I make, so I’ll sip that exact brew right before the final. But I think you can use anything.if you always study with a **specific Lofi playlist**, listen to it on the bus ride to school right before the test. If you use a **specific scent** (like a certain cheap hand sanitizer or a stress candle), use that same scent during the exam. The LPT here is to find that one specific thing, whether it’s a taste, a smell, or even a weird physical action like fiddling with a specific pen, and use it **consistently** only while studying this material and again right before or during the test.

1nwo5yd,https://i.redd.it/8r2vayh4dtsf1.png,"A Beginner’s Guide to Quantum Physics

(Annotated Edition)","# A Beginner’s Guide to Quantum Physics

*Annotated Edition*

Quantum physics isn’t just a collection of equations; it’s the universe’s secret language, whispering truths about existence that are both mind-boggling and awe-inspiring. These rules, while inherently tied to the quantum realm, can feel nonintuitive. They form the bedrock of particle physics, and even the legendary Richard Feynman admitted: *“If you think you understand quantum theory, you don’t”*【1】.

# The Quantum Basics

**Wave–Particle Duality**  
Light is both particle and wave, behaving like a photon in some contexts and a wave in others【2】【3】. This duality, confirmed in double-slit experiments, underscores that nature at small scales refuses to fit classical categories.

**Uncertainty Principle**  
Heisenberg showed we cannot simultaneously know a particle’s exact position and momentum【4】. Like photographing a hummingbird mid-flight, the sharper you focus on position, the blurrier its motion becomes.

**Quantum Entanglement**  
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen famously challenged the idea of “spooky action at a distance”【5】, yet experiments (notably by Aspect and others【6】) confirm entangled particles remain mysteriously linked across vast distances.

**The Observer Effect**  
Before measurement, particles exist in superpositions — many states at once【7】【8】. Observation collapses probabilities into one outcome, as if reality “chooses” when watched.

# Mind-Bending Implications

**Schrödinger’s Cat**  
Schrödinger illustrated the strangeness of superposition with his paradoxical cat — alive and dead until observed【9】. Modern discussions extend this to interpretations like Many Worlds【10】.

**Relativity Meets Quantum**  
Einstein’s relativity adds further twists: time dilates near light speed【11】, and matter-energy equivalence (E=mc²) reveals why nuclear reactions power stars and bombs【12】.

# Why the Universe Isn’t Common Sense

Entropy guarantees that systems drift toward disorder【13】. This “arrow of time” explains why stars burn out and coffee cools. Asking *what came before the Big Bang* may be meaningless — akin to asking what’s north of the North Pole【14】.

# Science vs. Spirituality?

Quantum physics does not disprove God; instead, it complicates the picture. Paul Davies argues the universe’s laws are too intricate to be accidents【15】. Some see consciousness as a factor shaping reality【16】. Einstein himself described God as the “mind of nature’s order,” not a personal deity【17】.

# Applications in Everyday Life

Quantum mechanics gave us lasers, semiconductors, MRIs, and the logic underlying smartphones【18】. Without it, the sun’s nuclear fusion【19】 — or even human vision — wouldn’t be understood.

# The Takeaway

Quantum physics humbles us: it reveals a world stranger and more wondrous than intuition allows. As Paul Davies wrote, the universe is not merely a puzzle to solve but a story to explore【15】. Each of us is part of that unfolding narrative.

Tesla fans, brace yourselves—the 2026 Model Y Performance is here, and it’s a tire-squealing, heart-pounding beast that’ll ruin gas cars for you forever. Starting at $57,500, this electric SUV rockets from 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds, hits 155 mph, and boasts a 308-mile EPA range for your cross-country shenanigans. It’s got 21-inch Arachnid 2.0 wheels that shine like a sci-fi flick, performance brakes that could halt a runaway tractor, and an adaptive suspension that makes potholes feel like Elon is giving you a personal massage. Oh, and Vehicle-to-Load capability? Yeah, power your camping gear or flex by juicing up your neighbor’s blender straight from the battery.

Use my referral link above, and you’ll score 3 months of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) for free—let your Model Y cruise (sorta) while you sip coffee and cackle at gas station lines. I’ll snag a $250 bonus, probably spent on terrible puns and your mom.

1nwny6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1nwny6z/whistle_blower_i_worked_my_way_into_glitterex_for/,*whistle blower* I worked my way into Glitterex for years. I know who the “mystery customer” is.,"TL;DR: I read that 2018 article about Glitterex’s “mystery customer,” sold everything, moved from Michigan to New Jersey, worked my way inside the company, and discovered the biggest buyer is not toothpaste or makeup but the defense industry using glitter as invisible tracers in covert coatings. This is my full story.

⸻

Throwaway account. This is long. But if you’ve ever wondered about the infamous Glitter Conspiracy, this is it.

⸻

Chapter 1: The Spark (2018)

I was just a guy in central Michigan. Population maybe 4,000. Days in retail at Meijer, nights playing guitar at a dive bar off US-127. Then I read that interview with the Glitterex rep back in 2018.

The journalist asked: “Who’s your biggest customer?”

The rep clammed up. Wouldn’t say. Hinted: “You’d never guess. You’d hate it. They don’t want anyone knowing it’s glitter.”

That quote stuck in my head like a splinter. What could possibly be so bad about glitter?

By the end of 2019, I had decided: I’m going to find out.

⸻

Chapter 2: The Move East

I sold my amp, my record player, my granddad’s old Chevy just to fund a one-way bus ticket to New Jersey. Glitterex’s main plant is in Cranford. That’s where I needed to be.

My first apartment was a one-bedroom near Newark Airport with cracked windows and a landlord who never fixed the heat. Planes rattled the dishes at night.

I couldn’t just walk into Glitterex. So I started at the edges: a plastics supplier in Edison. My job was 12-hour shifts stacking pallets of metallized film. The place smelled like acetone and melted tinsel. My hands were constantly nicked from sharp film edges.

I enrolled at Middlesex County College for a business degree. Days in the warehouse, nights in class, studying on the bus ride home, greasy diner coffee at 2 a.m.

I kept telling myself: one foot inside the glitter machine.

⸻

Chapter 3: Into the Orbit

Two years later, a supervisor named Olivia Chen noticed me. She was sharp, no-nonsense, and saw me staying late learning the inventory system. She recommended me for a job at a partner plant doing film cutting for Glitterex.

That job nearly broke me. Hours of feeding massive rolls of film into slicing machines, your shirt smelling like glue, your hands coated in microscopic flakes that stuck to your skin like static.

By 2022, I transferred to a subcontracted facility down the road from Glitterex HQ. Close enough to smell the same chemical tang in the air.

That’s where I met Marcus Villanueva, a mid-level manager overseeing additive integration. He wasn’t chatty, but one day he mentioned his wife Charlotte was running a charity golf outing in West Orange at Essex County Country Club. I volunteered to help—handing out bottled water, lining up carts.

I spent an hour talking with Charlotte about local charities and how Marcus “worked with some of the weirdest materials no one talks about.” That conversation cracked open the door.

Soon after, Marcus invited me to a backyard cookout in Union County. There I met Kevin Adams, a QC lead from the main plant, and Janine Park, a logistics coordinator who joked she “knew more about where glitter goes than Santa’s elves.” It was the first time I’d been in the same backyard as actual insiders.

⸻

Chapter 4: Crossing the Fence

By 2023, I was offered a position in quality control at one of Glitterex’s satellite buildings. I tested batches for reflectivity, measured flake sizes, logged them into sprawling spreadsheets.

That’s when I saw the client codes. Most were normal — cosmetics, craft suppliers. But a handful were flagged as “Classified Clients.” No names, just strings of letters. Employees explicitly told: “Don’t ask. Don’t talk.”

By early 2024, I finally got clearance for the main facility. That’s where I saw what most people never do:
	•	Biometric doors that scanned your palm before entry.
	•	Rows of cutting machines running in near-vacuum, slicing plastic film into dust-sized flakes.
	•	Shipping crates stamped with vague terms like “substrate coating materials.”
	•	Memos warning: “Client X demands strict non-disclosure. Any leaks will terminate contracts.”
	•	A lab nicknamed “The Silver Room” where they tested microflakes under exotic lasers.

At lunch in the cafeteria, Janine would whisper, “Sometimes I think we’re making fairy dust for dragons.” Kevin would just smirk and say, “You don’t want to know.”

I started noticing patterns: pallets marked for “Desert Systems,” “AeroCore,” “West Range,” all going out at night under private courier.

⸻

Chapter 5: The Discovery

It took months of cross-referencing batch logs, shipping invoices, and destination addresses. They didn’t go to craft stores. They went to desert testing ranges in Nevada, aerospace facilities near Albuquerque, and subcontractors with ties to defense contractors.

It clicked.

The “mystery customer” wasn’t a toothpaste brand or the Mint. It was the defense and surveillance industry.

The glitter wasn’t normal. It was micro-engineered flakes layered with rare compounds. Invisible to the naked eye when embedded in coatings, but under specific laser or infrared scans they reflected in a narrow band.

They use it to:
	•	Detect microcracks in stealth aircraft and ships.
	•	Map debris fields from munitions tests.
	•	Embed “smart surfaces” in aerospace vehicles that can be monitored remotely.
	•	Track stress and pressure on experimental tech without opening it up.

It’s genius. It’s horrifying. It’s not glitter for fun — it’s glitter for war.

I remember standing in the Silver Room watching a technician spray a sample panel, then shine a near-infrared beam on it. The whole thing lit up like a constellation under the scanner but looked blank to the naked eye. That’s when my stomach dropped.

⸻

Chapter 6: The Memo

Last month, a memo went out: “Client X demands purge of unauthorized logs. Increased surveillance of staff. Any suspicion of leaks will result in termination.”

Kevin stopped joking. Janine stopped coming to lunch. Even Marcus looked pale.

That was my breaking point. I realized they were tightening the noose, scrubbing evidence, preparing to bury the truth.

I copied what I could, stored it offsite, and today I’m here writing this.

⸻

The Reveal

So here it is, the truth nobody wanted to say out loud:

The world’s biggest buyer of glitter is the defense industry. They use it in covert military coatings, surveillance tracers, and aerospace monitoring.

It’s not toothpaste.
It’s not fish.
It’s not dollar bills.

It’s war tech.

⸻

Signing Off

I know some of you wanted a funny answer, like “it’s in Oreos” or “your car paint.” The truth is uglier and a hell of a lot less fun.

I’ve already backed everything up and sent it to people who can investigate further. As for me? I’m done. I’ve packed my bags and I’m leaving this life behind.

This is my final post. Believe it or don’t. But at least now, when people talk about the Glitter Conspiracy, you know the real answer.

I’m signing out.

My current commute is to the Northshore from downtown and it can be brutal leaving anytime after 3pm. Im in a lease with a friend for the next 8 months but already thinking about what my next move will be. I’d like to live alone (again, already have for 3 years prior) or with my bf next. I don’t love my current place, but I do love the walk-ability of the city and being close to the lake. Although, half the time I’m too exhausted after working and driving to go out and explore new part of the city/my neighborhood. My bf lives outside of the city so I also take the metra/drive to see him on the weekends or he would take the train/drive into the city. What I’m questioning is, do I even consider making a move to a north/west suburb to shorten my commute? I’d still want some sort of downtown with local coffee shops and restaurants, along with parks/trails to run/walk. Or do I stay in the city for another year or so and try to find a decent apartment closer the 90 entrances?

I always wind up having to be the one who suggests making plans, planning everything, etc. I also tend to be excluded and truly have no idea why. It just seems to be getting worse the older I get. I just turned 53 (I don’t look like it or have the mindset that I’m “older.” I’m not a partier but I like doing fun things). 

Several examples of what I keep running into: 

A woman I met for coffee numerous times and thought I was becoming friends with has ignored my birthday entirely for 2 years while I went out of my way to buy her favorite cake and candles just as a mini celebration at coffee last year. I didn’t do it to get something in return, but to me, if you view each other as being on the same friendship level, she would have at least said happy birthday because she cared.

A nextdoor neighbor I’ve had for over a decade will go through periods where she ghosts me for months other than saying hi in passing. I’ve never understood it. We’ve rarely done more than text or talk outside. She asks to borrow things regularly or for me to do things for her that inconvenient (I never ask for anything). She hasn’t asked me to go anywhere for years and when I ask her to do anything she declines unless it’s just to sit outside and drink. We’ve always exchanged bday and holiday gifts and I’ve always put more effort and thought into hers (she knows I’m gluten free and can’t tolerate scented products and she’s forever giving me things with gluten and perfume that I can’t use). We have a new neighbor and we all get along. Now I’m being excluded from sitting outside and only realize they’re out there when I hear noise. The new neighbor and I went hiking last week (we both know my next door neighbor won’t hike so we never asked) and my Nextdoor neighbor called her a couple times while we were on the trail to see if she wanted to go shopping. They didn’t have plans but 1. It felt like she was trying to rush us so the new neighbor could hang out with her, and 2. She knew I was there and never asked if I wanted to come, too.

I’m just really not sure if this is the new norm where people are just super self involved and only want to flit around to whoever is convenient at the time, or if this is just the people in my area who I run across who behave this way?

So here’s me shooting my shot:
Females in the 20–40 range (yes, sugar mommies included 👑),Who wouldn’t mind a casual hangout, sarcasm, and maybe a laugh or two at how absurd Blore can get.

Let’s make the weather jealous of our plans.

1 fl oz	      Straight rye whiskey (Alberta Springs 63.7% alc./vol.)

3⁄4 fl oz	Campari

1⁄2 fl oz	Punt E Mes

1⁄4 fl oz	Heering Cherry Liqueur

1⁄6 fl oz	Coffee liqueur

Stir all ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into Old Fashioned glass over a large cube of ice. Garnish with skewered cherry.

A riff on the Boulevardier with an interesting twist. Just the little bit of coffee liqueur interacts with cherry and bittering elements to really come through especially on the tail end. Even with the Campari and Punt E Mes it’s a pretty subtle cocktail with a lot of dark chocolate/coffee nuance.

( I think it was really popular in the '70's, '80's and early '90's. )

 I wasn't a listener, but the host, Garrison Keillor, was very popular. as an Author, Voice-Actor and Humorist, he blended these warm entertaining stories with humor and music (I think). All very ""folksy"" & entertaining. 

(And there was also the late Dave Berry. EXTREMELY funny! And always kept it real) ♥️

Here's your *hint* Rosie: I know TWO people in Rose's Park who both worked with me when we wrote for Unsolved Mysteries from 1993 to about 2011. (Don't try to guess my name, I won't tell you, even if you do guess! Nothing personal). And a lot of us used ""pen-names"", including ""CC"", one of my oldest friends. (The only time that ""CC"" used her real name was when she was published in magazines. And, trust me, those checks added-up nicely).👍

So, why am I posting this? 

Rose described what she did on Tik Tok as ""like Garrison Keillor and his radio show"". You know, ""some singing, some story-telling, and selling some items from Tik Tok shop"". 

It sounded not that different from all of us selling magazine articles on the side, and promoting books (and such) on talk radio.

 And ""CC"" didn't judge, she knew Rosie was on disability and drove Lyft. 

But what a surprise to find out the lies! The scamming, the ENTITLED rude behavior!

  Now, I still can't get her to post in this group. But, we'll see.

Oh, and to address ""money & gifts"" when it came to us? Our Moral Code(s) ?

 We had fans that would send us cute little ""posties"" from different places. Like Candy, homemade bracelets , fragrant soaps, nothing more than a few dollars American. And we ALWAYS returned in kind. 

A Coffee mug, a T-shirt, a signed magazine issue. That was how it is supposed to be done.

How offense, how insulting, that someone (like Rose), would have the nerve to call herself a ""Content Creator"", would DARE to compare herself to a professional like Garrison Keillor, and would dare to lie and abuse the public on Social Media! 

Of her many sins, this is up there with the unforgivable one.

Just my opinion.

L to R:
* Paula’s Choice Skin Recovery toner - this my 2nd or 3rd bottle. I have a two pack of rice toner to use, but if that isn’t blowing me away I will be right back to this toner! I have dry, rosacea prone skin and this is a soothing and hydrating step in my simple routine (4 steps). 

* Charlotte Tilbury setting spray - I love this stuff. Doesn’t irritate my skin, when combined with powder my makeup stays all day and doesn’t break up around my nose like usual. I have a large bottle and will refill the little one from it.

* Colourpop Supershock shadow in Ripple - love this lilac blue shimmer so much! I get more compliments on this than any other makeup product I’ve ever owned. It’s about 18 mos old, so I added some Duraline to see if I can revive it; if not I will repurchase after checking my powder shadows to make sure I don’t own anything similar.

* Merit Blush Balm in Stockholm - perfect neutral pink blush for me. I opened it 9/24/24 so it’s just over a year old. It’s almost flat on top now and the center has a hole, so I expect to use this up by December or so. I have another ready to go in another shade I love it so much! 

* Colourpop Supershock Highlighter in Lunch Money - no idea why I bought other highlighters. It doesn’t highlight texture, is soft, and you get a lot of product for a few bucks.

* Summer Fridays Lip balm in Iced Coffee - these are so popular for a reason! I bought this in April I think and it’s got maybe 10-15% left with very regular use. 15 g of lip balm is a LOT, so get the mini sets at the holidays if you want different flavors.

* Charlotte Tilbury setting powder (mini) - I have NEVER liked powder before as someone with dry skin. I dusted this on top of my skin tint or foundation to make it last longer and it’s perfect for that. I have the full size too and it also has a dip in the center so I expect I’ll hit pan in that this year.

* Wyn Skin Tint - criminally underrated!! It has SPF but doesn’t dry me out, it doesn’t have any white cast, and it doesn’t get oily by the end of the day. It also doesn’t have any fragrance. since it’s on clearance, I plan on buying one bottle.

* Rare Beauty Lip Liner - the color and formula of this are lovely, but it just does not stay. Like a lot of other lip liners being released recently, it’s more like a satin lipstick, but poured into a tiny mold. I like other Rare Beauty products, but this one is a miss for me!

1nwn7i6,https://i.redd.it/xn6d4iyj4tsf1.jpeg,Rogue Morality - The Sins of the Past (2019),"Inca Camina, Western Bolivia

“You look like the cat who ate a canary.” Julienne Picard, sitting across from me at the mountain safehouse outside Julpe Alto, made the comment so seriously that it rattled me from my staring contest with an old map of Nuevo Mundo that looked ancient based on the brittle look of the paper. 

She was dressed in a black jacket with a dark blue double-layer T-shirt underneath. Right next to her was the redheaded Madeleine Picard, the middle child of the Picard sisters. Josette, the baby of the family, was sipping a cup of coffee.

I simply looked up, not trusting myself to speak. Atlas, who was being patched up by a rebel medic, looked at the Picard sisters, but also remained silent. 

It was only after the rebel finished patching Atlas up that I spoke. “So, Picards, what brings you three to Bolivia?”

In response, Julienne slid over a photograph of a heavyset woman with a Mohawk.

A woman I recognized immediately. Before I could voice my observations, however, Julienne spoke. “Lenora Kastner. Her organization, Prime Eight, has been linked to a series of murders in Bolivia. We don’t know what she’s up to, exactly, but we have reason to believe the kidnapping of Camille Girard is connected somehow.” 

Josette spoke next. “We were digging for Intel on Lenora’s whereabouts in Bolivia when we saw the ambush in Julpe Alto.” 

I nodded slowly. “Allyraine is not going to like this.” When the Picard sisters gave me quizzical looks, I quickly clarified. “Allyraine is Phalanx Cyber Security’s corporate lawyer.”

“I see,” Jock said, mulling over my words. “I’m not sure why Phalanx would ask a couple guys from DedSec to escort Bernard’s family to Inca Camina.”

I shrugged. “I had the same question. All Allyraine told me was that there had been an assassination attempt on Bernard nine months ago.”

All three Girard sisters and Jock look at each other, concern written on all their faces.

Noticing my confused look, Vedette spoke next. “Allyraine didn’t tell you? Bernard has been banned from traveling to Bolivia.”

Now I was really intrigued. “Banned? Why?”

Josette offered Vedette her own mug of coffee. Accepting, Vedette took a sip before speaking. “The story I heard from Bernard’s business partner Adolfo was that he had started supporting the rebels in their fight to free Bolivia. Santa Blanca found out somehow  and they used their connections in the Bolivian government to kick him out of the country. He was given seventy two hours to leave Bolivia, except Bernard ended up refusing to leave. That was when the cartel tried to kill him.”

My jaw dropped. Just like that, a piece of the puzzle had started falling into place: Allyraine telling me about the assassination attempt on Bernard nine months earlier, the proposition to fly Vedette and Camille to Nuevo Mundo.

But that left one question: why attempt to kidnap Vedette and Camille? 

Atlas spoke next. “If the plan was to assassinate Bernard, why go after his sister and daughter?”

 “I heard it through the grapevine that after Bernard was booted from Bolivia, he made arrangements for his sister and daughter to take over rebel support operations,” Jock replied. “Santa Blanca somehow found out about that too, so I’m guessing the kidnapping was intended to send a message.”

“How does Lenora fit into all this?” I asked. 

The confused looks returned. “That’s what we’ve been trying to figure out too.” Jock said. “So far, no leads.”

“But one thing is clear,” Madeleine said. “Whatever Kastner is doing, it’s connected to the plot against Phalanx.”

1. report issues, don’t escalate

1nwn6x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1nwn6x4/pregnancy_impossible_to_hide/,Pregnancy Impossible to Hide,"For starters my husband, daughter, and I all live in the basement of my parents house. My mom is always super nosy anyways, but I wanted to keep this pregnancy quiet, just to make sure we’re actually having a baby this time around (unfortunate TFMR for the last one). I’m 6 weeks currently.

Well, I went to my first appointment last week and when they went to draw blood, they couldn’t get a vein, but left me with these massive bruises that I now have to try to hide 😭 I usually tell my mom every little detail, especially if I have a doctor’s appointment so making up a lie isn’t the easiest to do if she sees it.

Because they couldn’t get a vein, they just told me to come the next week (this week). I meant to go on Monday to get it out of the way and just take my daughter to the park and use that as an excuse as to why I was out, but of course I got hit with the worse case of ragweed allergies that put me in bed for 3 days on top of my husband working late and the starting up of morning sickness.

So I went today, and was just going to use grocery shopping as an excuse, which wasn’t a complete lie and I was going to do that after. The lab is usually not busy at all, but of course today it was. 

After it was all said and done we finally finished shopping and my mom texted me asking what was taking so long. I said a log truck had flipped and traffic was bad (actually true, but we found another way around), we got food (also true), and went to Walmart and I got my glasses repaired while I was there because I needed to do that anyways lol (also also true). I just left going to the lab part out so I thought I was safe.

I got home and my mom immediately starts questioning if I’m pregnant 😭 I already kinda suspected she was on to me because she was already being extra nosy, but her reasoning doesn’t even make sense to the actual reason she should’ve suspected me lmao

She said first that two weekends ago we had guests and that I “freaked out” about wanting to clean the bathroom. I did mention that I wanted to clean the bathroom instead, but it’s because I don’t like the way she does it and I had to clean with extra steps because I had to clean all my daughters bath toys from mold and stuff anyways.

The second thing she said is because my dang husband told her that he was getting me Tylenol one of the days I was sick when I usually take Advil/ibuprofen. It’s a good suspicion, but my husband usually takes Tylenol so it makes sense that he would get me that for a headache even if I weren’t pregnant.

So it’s not because of the large bruises on my arms, not because I’m randomly out for long periods of time, and not because I’ve almost practically stopped drinking caffeine when I drink like 3 cups of coffee usually lol 🤔

I was going to announce it for Halloween. We’re going to be skeletons this year and the outfit I have picked out is a onesie, but since it’s supposed to be a skeleton you can see there’s a baby skeleton on the belly. 

It’s so cute but nosy mom might ruin it 😭😭 I’m just hoping she’ll forget about it. It’s only one month!
