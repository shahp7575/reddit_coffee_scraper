1m68gbl,https://i.redd.it/zp4otxnaxdef1.png,PC black screening post BIOS update,"Hey everyone,

  
I flashed my BIOS yesterday to version 7B98v1F for the Z390-A PRO motherboard. Since then, I've had a few instances upon booting up games that my computer will black screen and I have to initiate a hard re-boot.

  
I updated my graphics drivers in line with the BIOS update, but it just seemed to happen to me just now upon booting Resident Evil 4 remake, but before that I was playing Session Skate Sim with no issues for about an hour, so I can't seem to pinpoint what the issue could be.

  
Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated, specs attached are my own, if that helps?

  
Thank you!",1,1753172302.0,pchelp,1,1.0,False
1m68fc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1m68fc5/the_moment_i_believed_it_was_all_real/,The moment I believed it was all real,"So, I wanted to share a little story, to maybe encourage some of you.
This made me realise how real this is, and I think about this once in a while to encourage myself. 
So, a few months, maybe close to a year back, I learned about manifestation.
Back in the day they told me to try and manifest something small, something I have no resistance towards, to make my believe around it grow. A lot of people recommended manifesting a free coffee. To me this wouldn't work because I have a client who gives me free coffee a few times a week. So I needed to do something different. But I also wanted it to be very specific, so I couldn't tell myself it was a coincidence. 
So that's when I told myself I would manifest a purple football. Specifically purple, because I never saw one. Nor do you ever see it anywhere.
The only thing I did was envision it a few times, whenever I thought about it, and believe I would find/see it somewhere.
I take my dog out twice a day, we go for a walk in the forrest behind my house. 
Not a lot of people go there, it's mostly known by the locals. So I barely ever see anyone there...
Let's say about a week later, I go for a walk, like I usually do. My dog is well trained and is mostly off leash... 
Suddenly she goes right into the forrest, between some bushes and trees... I followed her, and there it was, a purple blown-up BALLOON! (Nope not a football tho)
Mind you, no one was around, there was no sign of life... 
Can you imagine this? In the middle of the forrest, no one around, one single purple balloon, and my dog found it. I wouldn't even have seen it, if she wasn't off leash!
That's when I realised this is all real, tears started flowing, because this was the sign I needed...
You could say that this isn't specific enough, since I wanted a football. But maybe this is how it works sometimes. You ask for something, you get it, it might not always go or be the way you imagined it completely, but you still get it.
I was certain this was it. This was my turning point... I took the balloon home, and kept it as a reminder.
I hope I inspired some of you, who have doubts about this to try this out for yourself. Be specific, but it must be something, you don't actually care about. Something you would be fine with, if you didn't find it. But be certain you will. I guess this is exactly how bigger manifestations come true. Trust you will find it, but don't have a need for it. 
This is one of the many small things I manifested, but this one was the one that made my belief rock solid. Find something like that for yourself, it will give you so much encouragement!

1m68f6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1m68f6b/zp6_users_in_the_uk_bean_recommendations/,ZP6 users in the UK: bean recommendations,"Morning all,

As title says I need some recommendations for beans that you have tried and work really with the ZP6. 

I bought the ZP6 a month ago and had really good results with the leftover naturals I had from Skylark coffee. 

I then ordered two washed process bags from Scenery coffee and have spent nearly the whole two bags trying to dial in. I had a chest infection and realised a couple of days ago my zero point drifted to 1! So all my dialling in notes I made were futile üò≠ I‚Äôll include the specific bags I got below in case someone has got specific tips for the few cups I have left. The cups I have had were flat and muted. But I was probably grinding way too coarse. 

When I was going mad thinking what is wrong it occurred to me that my beans may have defects hence this post. 

I‚Äôm looking predominantly for washed coffees as this is what I have read work really well with the ZP6. Any general tips etc are more than welcome üôÇ

When I rushed down to city hall to get a replacement,the clerk dropped a bombshell: ""Ma'am, this certificate is fake.""  
  
I stormed back to the office, ready to confront Matthias Keane.  
  
Instead, I walked in on him pinning the intern against his office door kissing her.  
  
""Oh baby,I've been fighting with her for five damn years,"" he murmured against her lips, ""but I've been crazy about you for ten.""  
  
""Our real marriage certificate? Yeah, I've got it locked away safe and sound in my private vault.""  
  
When that same intern ""accidentally"" pushed me down the stairwell, leaving me bleeding all over the marble floor,Matthias just stood there, watching coldly.  
  
He wrapped his precious baby in his arms, voice all soft and protective.  
  
""Hey, don't look at that mess, sweetheart. You know blood makes you sick.""  
  
Later, the delayed medical response left me with severe brain trauma.  
  
When I finally woke up,my memories stopped to the year I absolutely despised him most.  
Chapter 1  
  
  
Two days after surgery, Matthias finally show up.  
  
  
I was joking around with one of the nurses when he walked in. The smile died on my face the moment I saw him.  
  
  
""What the hell are you doing here?""  
  
  
Matthias glanced at the bandage on my forehead, then let out this cold laugh. ""Calla's been worried about you for two days, and here you are putting on some act?""  
  
  
Before I could even figure out what the hell he meant, he stormed over.  
  
  
He reached out and yanked my IV line hardly.  
  
  
The needle tore out of my arm and I sucked in a sharp breath from the pain.  
  
  
Blood went everywhere. The nurse next to me let out a shriek and rushed to stop the bleeding.  
  
  
Once it hit me what he'd done, I slapped him across the face as hard as I could.  
  
  
""What is wrong with you? Did you die badly in a past life or something?""  
  
  
""Are you completely blind? Can't you see the bandages on my head?""  
  
  
When I first started at the company, that was when Matthias and I hated each other most.  
  
  
He'd call me a stick-in-the-mud with no personality. I'd tell him he was worse than a thug.  
  
  
Every conversation started with us basically cursing each other to go to hell.  
  
  
The slap knocked his head sideways. He looked absolutely shocked.  
  
  
He just stood there, speechless, but I wasn't about to let him off the hook.  
  
  
After the nurse got my hand bandaged up, I stared Matthias down.  
  
  
I was about to call security to throw his ass out.  
  
  
Then another nurse rushed in and said something that made my blood run cold.  
  
  
""Mr. Keane, could you sign here in the family section for Ms. Marchand?""  
  
  
Before Matthias could say anything, I grabbed the clipboard.  
  
  
""Sign what? He's not family.""  
  
  
But when I looked at the form, the words stuck in my throat.  
  
  
Right there in the spouse box was Matthias Keane's name.  
  
  
Seeing my reaction, Matthias rubbed his forehead.  
  
  
""Look, I know you're pissed about Calla, but her mom's dying. Her last wish is to see Calla get married.""  
  
  
""Calla and I grew up together. I'm the obvious choice. After... after her mom passes, we'll get divorced.""  
  
  
My hands were shaking as I pulled out my phone.  
  
  
There it was - ""Hubby"" at the top of my contacts with Matthias's same old profile pic.  
  
  
But in the company group chat, intern Calla Merrin had matching couple avatars with him.  
  
  
„ÄêGetting married next month! You're all invited to the wedding! „Äë  
  
  
She'd posted a picture but deleted it seconds later. Too late - I'd already screenshot it.  
  
  
It was a wedding photo of them. Matthias looking at her like she hung the moon.  
  
  
The group chat was going crazy, but I couldn't stomach reading any more.  
  
  
I didn't have a single photo of Matthias and me together in my phone.  
  
  
The doctor said the head injury left me with some complications.  
  
  
I'd lost five years of memories.  
  
  
I was still trying to wrap my head around apparently being married to my nemesis.  
  
  
And now I'm looking at his wedding photo with someone else.  
  
  
That's when a text popped up.  
  
  
From my friend Jessi who works at city hall.  
  
  
""Hey, about that background check on Matthias Keane you asked for. He got married a year ago.""  
  
  
""Spouse is listed as Calla Merrin.""  
  
  
""That certificate you showed me was fake - no official seal. Not legally binding.""  
  
  
Reading that last line felt like someone drove a knife straight through my chest.  
  
  
My head started pounding, everything getting fuzzy and painful.  
  
  
All these leftover feelings crashed over me like a wave, making my nose sting with tears.  
  
  
I was quiet for so long that Matthias must have thought I was giving in.  
  
  
He frowned and stepped closer, like he was going to reach for me.  
  
  
""You...""  
  
  
Matthias looked completely lost, like he had no clue how to explain this mess.  
  
  
Makes sense. We'd been enemies for so long, always at each other's throats.  
  
  
No wonder falling for him seemed so damn ridiculous.  
  
  
I took a deep breath. When I looked up again, my face was stone cold.  
  
  
""Don't you know office relationships are against company policy?""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Our last conversation ended with Calla calling.  
  
  
Matthias was about to explain something to me when her sobbing pulled him away.  
  
  
He rushed out with a quick ""Wait for me"" and never came back.  
  
  
I handled my own discharge paperwork and packed up my stuff alone.  
  
  
One of the young nurses felt bad for me and helped out, grumbling the whole time.  
  
  
""He claims to be your family, but where is he when you actually need him?""  
  
  
She was pissed on my behalf, but honestly, I didn't care anymore.  
  
  
Lucky for me, I never change my passwords, so my phone still worked fine.  
  
  
I found my new house address in my notes app and took a cab over.  
  
  
On my way out after unpacking, the owner of the coffee shop downstairs called out, ""The usual?""  
  
  
I said yes without thinking.  
  
  
Before I knew it, I was holding two breakfast sandwiches.  
  
  
Veggie wraps. I hate vegetables.  
  
  
The second I walked into the office, a coworker teased me, ""Bringing breakfast for Keane again?""  
  
  
Before he'd even finished talking, someone snatched them right out of my hands.  
  
  
Calla's face lit up. ""Oh Evelina, you're the best! I absolutely love the veggie wraps from that place.""  
  
  
Her fake-sweet tone made me frown.  
  
  
I grabbed the wraps back and handed them to my coworker, raising an eyebrow.  
  
  
""These are for you. Careful not to let the fake bitch contaminate them.""  
  
  
He just stood there stunned, but before he could react, Matthias walked over.  
  
  
First, he pulled red-eyed Calla behind him protectively.  
  
  
Then he looked down at me.  
  
  
""Just because Calla and I have the same taste in food, you're gonna take it out on her?""  
  
  
The colleagues who'd been enjoying the drama went quiet after that.  
  
  
They kept giving us weird looks, glancing between the three of us.  
  
  
Makes sense - the two main players in this mess had already been the hot topic of the office since yesterday.  
  
  
I stayed quiet too long. Someone was about to step in and defend me.  
  
  
But before she could say anything, Calla started crying again.  
  
  
All tears and trembling, looking absolutely pitiful. ""I didn't know you'd started liking that flavor too after I left.""  
  
  
""When I saw the familiar packaging, I thought Evelina had brought them for me.""  
  
  
Matthias shot me a warning look, then turned to gently wipe her tears.  
  
  
I stared at the watch on his wrist, couldn't look away.  
  
  
I'd seen the exact same one on the nightstand at home. The women's version.  
  
  
By the time I snapped out of it, Calla was saying""If it bothers you, I can apologize.""  
  
  
The fake sweetness was making me sick. Reminded me of those manipulative bitches I used to rant about for days.  
  
  
I blinked and said, ""Then apologize.""  
  
  
Calla choked on her words. Even stopped crying.  
  
  
I smoothed out my expression and pointed to the name tag on my chest.  
  
  
""You're an intern. Do you really want to mess with manager?""  
  
  
""I know you're straightforward, but you don't have to be a complete bitch about it.""  
  
  
I emphasized the word ""manager.""  
  
  
According to company rules, Calla should've been fired.  
  
  
Matthias took the fall for her, got himself demoted to save her job.  
  
  
I sighed, couldn't understand why he was being so damn stupid.  
  
  
Last night I'd stayed up reading through all our old text messages.  
  
  
That's how I found out we'd been having some secret relationship for three years.  
  
  
Matthias never once made us public.  
  
  
Now watching him protect Calla like this, I had mixed feelings about the whole thing.  
  
  
But I kept my face neutral and picked up a box, handing it to Matthias with a smile.  
  
  
""Hey Matty, better get moving to your new desk.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
I never thought about quitting.  
  
  
After all, I wasn't the one who screwed up. No reason I should have to leave.  
  
  
But when I was heading out after work, Matthias stopped me.  
  
  
He looked conflicted, muttering to himself, ""Are you still mad? I didn't know you were getting discharged today.""  
  
  
""I had no idea Calla was gonna post that wedding announcement in the company chat. It was an accident.""  
  
  
I gave him a look and my mouth ran faster than my brain.  
  
  
""You're so good at passing the buck, you should've been a politician instead.""  
  
  
""Really treating people like they're idiots and don't know any better. Such an 'accident.'""  
  
  
I hadn't been this sarcastic in ages. Matthias just stared at me, stunned.  
  
  
He glanced at me, like something occurred to him. ""How's your injury?""  
  
  
The back of my head was still wrapped in gauze. Couldn't see what was underneath.  
  
  
When Matthias brought it up, I hesitated for a moment.  
  
  
I didn't want him to keep bugging me, so I was about to tell him about the memory loss.  
  
  
But then Calla came running over and grabbed onto his arm.  
  
  
""You promised we'd go to dinner together. I've been waiting forever.""  
  
  
Her attempt to change the subject was so obvious, but it worked on Matthias.  
  
  
He told her not to make a scene, but his feet were already turning toward her.  
  
  
Before leaving, he tossed me a box, looking like he wanted to say something but couldn't find the words.  
  
  
I opened it. Inside was a necklace.  
  
  
The diamond in the center was about the size of my pinky nail.  
  
  
I snapped the box shut like it burned me. Just as I was about to chase after them, I saw Calla turn her head.  
  
  
She casually showed off her hand, flashing a rock the size of a pigeon egg on her finger.  
  
  
""I've been wearing the ring from when you proposed in front of my mom this whole time.""  
  
  
""Mom said we should visit her together next weekend.""  
  
  
I instinctively looked down at my own ring finger.  
  
  
No ring. No tan line either.  
  
  
They drove off, and I was still standing there like an idiot.  
  
  
A coworker walked by and said hi.  
  
  
""Finally gonna get rid of Calla Merrin, huh? Do you know how much trouble she's caused?""  
  
  
I mumbled agreement, looking down at the papers I'd been clutching.  
  
  
Calla had been assigned to Matthias's team as an intern.  
  
  
Now that Matthias's authority had been transferred to me.  
  
  
The first thing I did was terminate Calla's employment contract.  
  
  
I thought about it for a moment, then sent Calla a message.  
  
  
The next second, she sent back a photo.  
  
  
That ring-covered hand holding a bouquet of roses, with the corner of a man's suit jacket barely visible.  
  
  
I'd just typed back a question mark when Calla posted boldly in the company group chat.  
  
  
""Don't understand why some people insist on trying to be a homewrecker.""  
  
  
""I made that announcement specifically to warn certain people, but they're still hanging around.""  
  
  
People started gossiping immediately, but I just laughed coldly.  
  
  
If she wouldn't listen, then I didn't need to keep trying.  
  
  
I blocked Calla.  
  
  
She went quiet for a while, probably waiting for a response.  
  
  
When my phone lit up again, it was Matthias who has been pissed off.  
  
  
""Why did you block Calla? Can you stop being such a brat?""  
  
  
When I didn't respond, he threatened me""Add her back, or I'll call you out in front of everyone.""  
  
  
Matthias was counting on me not wanting to cause a scene over something so petty.  
  
  
But I just sent him a few lines.  
  
  
""Didn't the doctor tell you, as my 'family,' that I lost five years of memory?""  
  
  
""Don't worry, you'll be joining your precious Calla soon enough.""  
  
  
The next second, I texted my brother Noel Marchand.  
  
  
""Your sister's getting screwed over at her own company. Time to come.""

Grateful for my ability to engage to acknowledge this, connect and complement them.","Today while walking, I saw a young woman, fit, engaging, friendly. She was walking down the side walk and a car was driving so so slowing, while they were talking.

In my You Tube addiction, I often watch videos about foreigners learning about Canadians/Canadian things and what makes us Canadian, some serious, some funny, some accurate, some stereotypes. 

And OMG...this woman fit the complete classic stereotype to the point I almost got whip lash and was chuckling inside how she ticked off the boxes.

I had to tell her, point it out, mentioned you tube etc -then mentioned how she was walking down the street talking ( I didnt hear what sentence she had said ) and distinctly ended her sentence with ""EH"", while eating a Persian (a Canadain or perhaps only from Ontario ?) pastry and even had a large (""double, double"" likely lol) Timmys ( from Tim Hortin coffee shop) in hand : D lol.

A classic iconic stereotypical image of a Canadian woman lol\_\_\_\_\_ 

After I mentioned it, she agreed and we each added comments and we both laughed gleefully together. Was just a nice light exchange, a nice bonding with a fellow Canadian stranger.

Shortly afterward, as I was walking, I commented a complement to another stranger.

This next, like the last lady, was just a joy to look at, each lending their brightness to the outer world around them.

This second lady was so unique, with such colourful whimsy. 

She was getting into a small rounded toy looking type of car that reminded me of a Volkswagen Beatle Bug car but this one was even rounded and cant say what it was....but it was so bold, with depth of colour and strikingly rich it a gleaming mustard like  yellow. She had a bob  or pixie type cut ( cant remember) but her 60's or 70's style type runners were the same colour as her car üòÇüòçüòÅand she wore a candy apple red head band with white polka dots  with various other adornments on her attire and her car. She really stuck out as just one of those special type of people adding such richness, energy, levity, that I was struck by the combined presence and style of  her and her car. I commented on how lovely and colourful, what good energy, her matching yellow items, red band. We exchanged some conversation and I soon learned her inner energy was as vibrant as her outer colour. I was really surprised when she told me I had made her day by stopping to share my complement and in turn, it made my day to hear that, to hear that I had.

Overall, it was such a captivating, compelling, connecting, lovely, fulfilling, meaningful, mindful, reflecting, uplifting walk home.

I was really grateful I had encountered these two persons, that I had the ability, the confidence, the gregarious nature, the self esteem etc to complement others.... to stop, take notice and engage people in conversation.

Was really grateful for their presence and the delightful differences, the colour and brightness they added to my day and the world around them. I am grateful for people that dare to be different and to stick out in a crown to make the journey a little more enjoyable and pleasant along the way.",1,1753171943.0,gratitude,0,1.0,False

&#x200B;

Java Burn is not just another weight loss supplement; it's a transformational elixir that has left me astounded. As someone who has explored various weight management products, Java Burn stands out as a revolutionary solution. This review sheds light on my personal experience with Java Burn, a product that has redefined my approach to weight loss.

&#x200B;

\*\*Effective Weight Management: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn's primary claim is to enhance weight loss, and it delivers on this promise with impressive results. After incorporating it into my daily routine, I experienced a noticeable increase in my metabolism. This translated into more effective fat burning, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. The pounds started melting away, and I felt more energetic throughout the day.

&#x200B;

\*\*Sustained Energy: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

One of the most remarkable aspects of Java Burn is its ability to provide sustained energy without the typical jitters associated with some weight loss supplements. Instead of experiencing crashes, I felt a steady and consistent stream of energy, which was instrumental in maintaining an active lifestyle. It helped me power through workouts and stay alert throughout my day, making it easier to make healthier choices.

&#x200B;

\*\*Enhanced Mental Clarity: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn doesn't just target physical weight loss; it also supports mental clarity and focus. The blend of natural ingredients, including nootropics, contributed to improved cognitive function. This mental boost helped me stay on track with my weight loss goals by reducing cravings and emotional eating.

&#x200B;

\*\*Natural Ingredients: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn's use of natural ingredients is commendable. It contains a blend of powerful compounds like green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and more, which are backed by scientific research for their weight management benefits. Knowing that I was consuming a product with safe and natural ingredients gave me confidence in its effectiveness and safety.

&#x200B;

\*\*Conclusion:\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn is a game-changer in the world of weight management supplements. It doesn't promise overnight miracles but offers a holistic approach to sustainable weight loss. I've experienced firsthand how it can boost metabolism, provide lasting energy, enhance mental clarity, and support a healthier lifestyle. If you're on a weight loss journey and want a reliable partner, Java Burn is worth a try.

1m6816m,https://i.redd.it/114wfg1csdef1.png,The Wife on Trial - All it took was her mother accidentally brushing against the custom-made gown of the city‚Äôs richest heiress,"Chapter 1

All it took was her mother accidentally brushing against the custom-made gown of the city‚Äôs richest heiress‚Äîfor Sloane West‚Äôs mother to be dragged away, limbs broken, and thrown into the sea.





When she finally pressed charges against that arrogant debutante, the court ruled the girl not guilty.





Because the defense attorney standing by her side was none other than the founder of the city of Riverstone‚Äôs most prestigious law firm‚ÄîSloane‚Äôs husband, Declan Hawthorne.





As the trial ended, the poised, aristocratic man with cold eyes walked away from the defendant‚Äôs seat and placed an apology letter on the table in front of her.





‚ÄúSloane, just sign it. You wouldn‚Äôt want to get sued for slander and end up in jail, would you?‚Äù





His tone was gentle and coaxing, but behind the gold-rimmed glasses, his eyes were sharp as a blade.





Sloane stared at him, defiant tears brimming in her eyes, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúWhy, Declan?‚Äù





She couldn‚Äôt understand.





She was his wife. He had loved her so fiercely that he gave up his inheritance and endured being locked away by the Hawthornes‚Äîjust to marry his former caregiver.





But after her mother‚Äôs death, she had begged him countless times, crying. Even this morning, she had knelt at his feet once again, threatening divorce if he refused to drop the case.





And what had he said?





‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push me, Sloane.‚Äù





Declan loosened his tie, visibly frustrated. ‚ÄúVivienne‚Äôs different. She chased me for ten years. She once saved my life.‚Äù





‚ÄúI owe her. I have to protect her‚Äîeven if that means going against you, my wife, the woman I love most.‚Äù





He tapped his tablet, bringing up a live stream and turning the screen toward Sloane.





‚ÄúYou have two minutes. If not for yourself, do it for your mother. Sign the apology, and I‚Äôll give her ashes back to you.‚Äù





On the screen: a yacht out at sea. Several bodyguards were holding a mahogany urn over the railing, ready to let go at any moment.





Tears spilled from Sloane‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù





He didn‚Äôt even flinch. ‚ÄúBe good. Don‚Äôt waste time. Are you really going to leave your mother to drift in the ocean forever?‚Äù





‚ÄúDeclan!‚Äù Sloane's voice was hoarse with rage, her eyes burning. ‚ÄúI want a divorce!‚Äù





But in this brutal standoff, he stayed cold. Unmoved.





‚ÄúSloane, you‚Äôve got thirty seconds left.‚Äù





At that moment, her heart clenched like it had been stabbed.





How ironic. This was the man who once loved her like life itself.





Eight years ago, he‚Äôd fallen for her at first sight at the Hawthorne estate.





She was working as his grandfather‚Äôs caregiver. Their worlds couldn‚Äôt have been further apart‚Äîbut he confessed to her over and over again. A hundred times, at least.





He once saw her glance at a patch of bellflowers, and that same night had all the roses in the garden replaced.





When she twisted her ankle, he booked out an entire hospital floor just for her.





That was also when she learned about the girl chasing him‚ÄîVivienne Blake, childhood friend and heiress of one of the wealthiest families in Riverstone. She‚Äôd pursued him for years, to the point of obsession.





But Declan never once looked her way.





‚ÄúSloane, I love only you. So what if Vivienne and I are ‚Äòa perfect social match‚Äô? I can‚Äôt stand her.‚Äù





The Hawthorne family tried to force him to give up. They stripped his shares and exiled him to a private island overseas.





He went on a hunger strike for twenty straight days to get the outside world to relent‚Äîand it worked. He moved Sloane‚Äôs heart.





They got married. And for a time, he truly loved her like he promised.





Everything changed six months ago when Vivienne suddenly returned from abroad‚Äîand this time, Declan‚Äôs attitude toward her shifted drastically.





He canceled international meetings just to pick her up at the airport. For her welcome-home party, he stayed out for three straight nights.





When Sloane confronted him, he told her the truth. ‚ÄúA year ago in London, I was in a car crash. Vivienne saved me‚Äîshe was in a coma for a year because of it.‚Äù





‚ÄúSloane, I love you. But she just woke up. I need to repay her. Just give me a year, okay?‚Äù





At first, she believed him.





Until the night of the party. She collapsed from a flare-up of an old illness and was rushed to the ER. Declan didn‚Äôt answer a single call.





In desperation, her mother went to the yacht where the party was held. But she never came back.





Everyone insisted her mother had taken her own life‚Äîthat it was suicide, not murder.





Even Declan, who hadn‚Äôt been at the scene, believed that.





But Sloane remembered the call she got after the surgery. She‚Äôd heard chaos, Vivienne yelling‚Äîand her mother‚Äôs screams of pain.





Her mother didn‚Äôt jump. She was forced.





In the six months since, she‚Äôd been drowning in guilt and grief, crying herself to sleep night after night. In the depths of her despair, she finally uncovered a single clue‚Äîfrom a waiter.





She pleaded with Declan again and again, begging him to help her.





But when the case finally went to court, he didn‚Äôt hesitate to stand on the other side.





To defend the woman who killed her mother, Declan threatened Sloane with her own mother‚Äôs ashes, just to force her to bow her head and apologize.





At that moment, as Sloane looked at Declan, he felt so foreign‚Äîlike a demon risen straight from hell.





She was done. Broken. Her fingers shook as she scrawled her name on the apology letter.





‚ÄúThere. Satisfied? Now bring them back from the boat...‚Äù





But her hoarse voice had barely faded when a cry rang out behind her.





Vivienne suddenly collapsed at the defendant‚Äôs table, clutching her head. ‚ÄúDeclan! Help me‚Äîmy head hurts!‚Äù





In an instant, Declan dropped the tablet in a flurry and bolted toward her.





On the stream, the countdown ended. Without Declan‚Äôs orders to stop, the bodyguards opened the urn...





‚ÄúNo! I signed it! Declan, tell them to stop!‚Äù





Sloane screamed, hysterical. But no one listened.





She lunged forward, trying to stop Declan‚Äîbut he had eyes only for Vivienne. Holding her in his arms, he rushed out, elbow slamming hard into Sloane without even looking back.





She fell to the ground. Her head hit the corner of the table. Tears rained onto the still-playing tablet.





Too late. It was already too late.





On screen, the ashes was poured from the boat‚Äîcaught by the icy sea wind, they scattered bit by bit, vanishing into the churning grey waves.





A gut-wrenching guilt tore at her heart.





Her mother had always feared the cold. She'd hated the ocean most of all. And now, she‚Äôd died in it‚Äîand would remain trapped in it forever.





‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Mom...‚Äù Sloane‚Äôs sobs shattered.





Suddenly, she was filled with regret. Regret for ever loving Declan. Regret for ever marrying him.





Endless guilt tolled through her like a funeral bell and her vision dimmed.





As the world went dark, she heard one last thing‚ÄîDeclan‚Äôs panicked voice outside the courtroom.





‚ÄúVivienne, hang in there. I‚Äôll do anything you want‚Äîjust stay alive!‚Äù



Chapter 2

Sloane woke up in a hospital.





A young associate lawyer stood by the bed, clearly at a loss. ‚ÄúMs. West, the court has finalized the ruling. You need to take care of your health now‚Äîdon‚Äôt let this consume you.‚Äù





Still reeling from the pain in her chest, Sloane sat up abruptly, ignoring the IV needle in her hand as she rummaged through her bag.





‚ÄúCan you please check if this paper holds up?‚Äù Her voice shook as she pulled out a document and handed it over.





The lawyer reviewed it and nodded. ‚ÄúMs. West, your husband has already signed the divorce papers. Once you sign and file it with the court, the divorce will be finalized in about thirty to sixty days.‚Äù





That very morning, she‚Äôd taken the document to Declan and knelt before him.





Maybe he was in too much of a rush‚Ä¶ or maybe he just didn‚Äôt believe she would actually leave.





He assumed the agreement was a bluff. Without even glancing at it, he signed.





But he‚Äôd never realize‚Äîeverything she said was real.





Sloane didn‚Äôt wait another second. She yanked out the IV and rushed straight to City Hall to submit the paperwork.





Once it was done, she made one last stop‚Äîat the coast. In the light, drizzling rain, she knelt down on the cold, wet sand. ‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶ wherever you are, I‚Äôll find a place by the sea and stay with you forever.‚Äù





The only response was the icy wind sweeping off the ocean.





She didn‚Äôt know how long she knelt there. When she finally wiped her tears away, she pulled out her phone and made a call. ‚ÄúHi. I... I‚Äôd like to schedule a staged death and extraction.‚Äù





Her voice was broken, but her tone left no room for doubt. ‚ÄúThe cause of death will be listed as homicide. I‚Äôll arrange the scene. All you need to do is rescue me and create a new identity. Then send me abroad.‚Äù





This wasn‚Äôt just about divorce.





One month from now, she‚Äôd make him pay‚Äîpersonally. And it would be something ‚Äòsurprising‚Äô Declan would never forget.





By the time everything was in place and Sloane returned to the mansion, night had fallen.





The lights were on in the living room. Declan was sitting on the couch, gently spooning chicken soup into Vivienne‚Äôs mouth.





‚ÄúDeclan, I uploaded that apology letter online,‚Äù Vivienne said as she tilted her head and leaned against him.





‚ÄúSloane‚Äôs been smearing me for so long‚Äîlet the internet teach her a lesson. You‚Äôd better stay out of it.‚Äù





Declan swallowed hard but still nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. She made her bed.‚Äù





Sloane suddenly remembered vicious voices online‚Äîmocking her mother‚Äôs death as well-deserved, sneering that she was just a washed-up maid, not even fit to lick the boots of a woman like Vivienne.





Her chest tightened. She walked into the room, face blank.





‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù





Declan asked, noticing her pale complexion. His tone softened slightly. ‚ÄúWhat happened to your forehead?‚Äù





Sloane ignored him.





Vivienne chimed in, her voice high and saccharine. ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre back, Sloane! Perfect timing‚ÄîI brought you some gifts. Come take a look.‚Äù





Declan cleared his throat, clearly hesitant. ‚ÄúSloane, Vivienne‚Äôs still recovering from the coma. She‚Äôs going to be staying here for a while. I need you to be considerate. She‚Äôs lactose-intolerant, can‚Äôt eat cold foods, needs ten hours of beauty sleep, and only drinks fruit juice if it‚Äôs freshly pressed...‚Äù





Each word felt like a dagger to Sloane‚Äôs heart.





She let out a cold, disbelieving laugh. ‚ÄúYou want me to take care of her?‚Äù





‚ÄúCome on, Sloane. Let bygones be bygones. You used to work as a housekeeper for my family‚Äîyou‚Äôre good at this. I trust you‚Ä¶‚Äù





His voice trailed off.





Beside the dining table, an entire list of Princess Vivienne-care instructions was laid out‚Äî267 items long.





Luxury shopping bags were scattered all over the floor‚Äîscuffed Chanel clutches, freebie Herm√®s keychains, worn Dior heels...





So these ‚Äúgifts‚Äù were just designer trash she no longer wanted.





Sloane suddenly remembered: years ago, one of Declan‚Äôs friends had once sneered and called her ‚Äúa servant girl.‚Äù That night, Declan had gone ballistic‚Äîhe‚Äôd pulled strings and shut down a near-billion-dollar project just to defend her.





‚ÄúSloane is my wife. Anyone who dares belittle or bully her is insulting me.‚Äù





And now, he was doing it himself, handing her over to her enemy‚Äîas a live-in maid.





So much for love. So much for promises.





She would never believe him again.





Blinking back the tears burning her eyes, Sloane told herself: just thirty more days. She would endure anything.





She didn‚Äôt expect Vivienne to pull her first stunt‚Äîscreaming from a nightmare that very night.





Sometime after midnight, Vivienne burst into the master bedroom barefoot. Declan had just stepped out of the shower.





‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep alone,‚Äù she whimpered and climbed into his arms, pressing herself against his bare chest. ‚ÄúThe mattress in the guest room is too hard. I‚Äôm scared. Stay with me?‚Äù





Declan‚Äôs brow furrowed slightly.





And Sloane could see it‚Äîhe felt sorry for her.





So sorry, he didn‚Äôt even care that Sloane was right there. He cradled Vivienne in his lap like she were fragile crystal.





Then he looked at Sloane and said, ‚ÄúSloane‚Ä¶ Vivienne‚Äôs never suffered in her life. Do you think you could‚Ä¶ maybe take another room tonight?‚Äù





In that moment, Sloane caught a glint of triumph flash across Vivienne‚Äôs face.





She smiled bitterly, picked up her pillow, and got up from the bed.





‚ÄúIf Miss Blake likes this bed so much, then let her have it.‚Äù





Not just the bed. She could have the room, and the man, too. Sloane didn‚Äôt want any of it anymore.



Chapter 3

In the days that followed, with Declan staying by her side every night, Vivienne quickly regained her energy. Bored at home, she even started inviting her girlfriends over for afternoon tea.





‚ÄúDeclan totally has feelings for you. When you were in a coma, he kept flying back and forth to London. He even swore that if you woke up, he‚Äôd divorce his wife for you!‚Äù





Sloane happened to walk past just in time to hear that. The words cut straight through her like a jagged blade.





With Declan not around, Vivienne dropped the act and called out, all fake sweetness and spite. ‚ÄúSloane, what the hell is this coffee? Tastes like dishwater. Honestly? It‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äù





Expressionless, Sloane stepped forward to take the cup away, but before she could, someone grabbed her wrist.





‚ÄúWhat kind of attitude is that? You‚Äôre Vivienne‚Äôs maid now. Make her sick and you‚Äôll be on your knees begging for forgiveness‚Äîgot it?‚Äù





At Vivienne‚Äôs subtle nod, one of her friends sneered and snapped.





Before Sloane could react, the woman yanked her hair, and a full cup of scalding coffee went flying‚Äîstraight at her.





‚ÄúStop!‚Äù





A sudden, angry shout broke the chaos. Declan had just stepped through the door. His eyes went dark as he stormed over, pulling Sloane behind him in one sharp motion.





‚ÄúWho the hell said you could touch her?‚Äù





His roar had barely died away when Vivienne, who had been watching with a smirk, suddenly teared up. In one fluid motion, she grabbed her stomach. ‚ÄúDeclan! No‚Äîit‚Äôs not what it looks like!‚Äù





‚ÄúDon‚Äôt blame them, it‚Äôs all my fault‚Ä¶ Sloane put dairy in my coffee on purpose. I‚Äôm in so much pain‚Ä¶‚Äù





Declan froze. His gaze turned toward Sloane, full of suspicion‚Äîand then cold.





‚ÄúDairy?‚Äù





‚ÄúSloane, I told you‚ÄîVivienne is lactose-intolerant!‚Äù





Unbelievable. Just one lie from Vivienne, and he went from protecting her to condemning her.





‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt!‚Äù Sloane shouted, her hair still dripping with coffee, eyes burning with unshed tears. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs faking it!‚Äù





But her words were drowned out‚Äîby Vivienne‚Äôs sobbing performance and her friends‚Äô dramatic embellishments.





Finally, Declan lost it. He smashed the coffee cup on the table and picked Vivienne up in his arms.





‚ÄúSloane West, stay home and reflect on what you‚Äôve done!‚Äù





But Vivienne wasn‚Äôt satisfied. She wept, trembling like a broken doll. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go to the hospital‚Ä¶ No one‚Äôs ever treated me like this before. It hurts, Declan. Just let me die.‚Äù





She sobbed and resisted so stubbornly that Declan finally snapped. His voice cutting like ice as he called for the guards.





‚ÄúBring her to the back wing. Lock her in!‚Äù





The back wing. A soundproof, pitch-dark room the size of a closet.





It was originally designed as punishment for disobedient security staff‚Äîcomplete with random insect releases to ‚Äútest endurance.‚Äù





Sloane trembled and struggled as the bodyguards dragged her out.





‚ÄúNo! Please! Don‚Äôt do this!‚Äù





But no matter how she cried and begged, the man walking away with Vivienne in his arms never once looked back.





For twenty-four hours, Sloane curled up in the dark corner, scratching at the crawling itch on her skin as if she were on fire.





Tiny insects scurried over her body, and the sensation nearly drove her insane.





She screamed. She sobbed. But the guards outside, under Declan‚Äôs orders, didn‚Äôt so much as flinch.





By the time she lost consciousness, her body was covered in welts and bleeding scratches. She‚Äôd forgotten what pain even felt like. Her body had gone numb.





Only one tear escaped, trailing down her cheek as she closed her eyes and let the last shred of love drain from her soul.





‚ÄúSloane‚Ä¶ please. Wake up. Come on, open your eyes.‚Äù





A familiar voice pulled her back. Sloane gasped awake, blinking up at the crystal chandelier in the guest bedroom.





Declan sat at her bedside, visibly relieved to see her awake. His voice softened unconsciously. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre angry. But what you did was still wrong. You shouldn‚Äôt have hurt Vivienne.‚Äù





Hearing his blame before anything else, Sloane gave a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúYou believe her just like that?‚Äù





Declan frowned, a flash of impatience in his expression. ‚ÄúEnough. I already hired someone to perform a spiritual ceremony for my mom by the coast. It‚Äôs over. Let it go. Right now, Vivienne‚Äôs the one who really needs help‚Ä¶‚Äù





‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been pampered since birth. She‚Äôs not sleeping. The doctors can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs wrong. The spiritual guide we brought in said the only way to break the bad energy‚Ä¶ is for the person who harmed her to craft a protective bracelet. By hand. From thorns.





Sloane froze.





So all that time he stayed by her side, waiting for her to wake up‚Äîwas just for Vivienne?",1,1753170667.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Also I transferred before my associates partially cause I failed a lot of classes and partially cause college has psychiatrists now. 

I kinda ghosted them over the summer, didn‚Äôt take any classes. Worked out more and completely quit coffee. 
0 stress helped and I stopped thinking there were hidden cameras everywhere or that I had telepathy and a bunch of stuff  and am way less paranoid(still have some but I‚Äôm working g on that). OCassionally I still do sense entities and hear things late at night mostly. 

Thing is where‚Äôs the level at which you‚Äôre doing fine without seeing a psychiatrist? My therapist said my issues will ‚Äújust get worse if you don‚Äôt‚Äù and I feel like I‚Äôm managing everything ok (living with my parents not taking college classes and not having a job helps?) 

So once my classes start that‚Äôs hours g to be a lot of stress but I feel like k should just keep working out and quitting coffee and if I did that I won‚Äôt go back to thinking k can sense spirits everywhere and such. 
Also I feel like if I go to a psychiatrist they would obviously say in malingering but idk how true that is. 

Deep down I don‚Äôt really want anything on my medical record especially related to college and I keep finding reasons not to. 
Also boom 3:45 not tired can‚Äôt sleep so I might start drinking coffee again.

I have this feeling of not finding peace and quiet at my hometown so I‚Äôve decided to take myself on a 5-7 days retreat next to the ocean in August or September. I‚Äôve spent two weeks researching where to go but I am not sure if they fit the criteria so I am here asking for advice. 
What I am looking for is a small safe city, next to the ocean either in Spain, Portugal or France. I don‚Äôt care about swimming that much, but the view of the ocean gives me great comfort and a way to reconnect. My itinerary for each day would be to go for an early run, stare at the ocean, read, cook food, drink a coffee, do some people watching and go out to eat dinner at a local restaurant. Since I love to cook one of my other criteria is that the place has a market with local produce that I could explore and try. I am really interested in history and culture as well, and in possibly going on a day trip or two somewhere near to my location (to hike, wine taste, etc.) but the plan is to not overcrowd my itinerary since the point of the whole trip would be to have a break from the busyness. 
In the past I‚Äôve been on a Portugal roadtrip, but it was mainly the touristy areas with only short stays in each place. Also I‚Äôve been to Bilbao and San Sebastian and fell in love with the Basque region, now I am looking for smaller towns. To northern France I‚Äôve never been but it also looks very lovely. 
I will spend around 100-150‚Ç¨ on the airplane ticket, so it would be great if the town is accessible from public transport and near a major airport. The accommodation should also be under 60‚Ç¨ per day, so that I can spend more on restaurants and markets. 

Does anyone have a place in mind that could serve this purpose? I was initially thinking Nazare, but there is not much to do. Maybe you know any place near Porto or Lisbon? Or the Cantabria region (Comillas, San Vicente) in Spain? I‚Äôve never been to France but heard good things about Biarritz, but it might be too much. 

Thank you so much in advance if you took the time to read this and shared your suggestions! ",1,1753169985.0,solofemaletravel,0,1.0,False

1m67uaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m67uaz/im_meeting_my_best_friend_tiffany_at_the_campsite/,I'm Meeting My Best Friend Tiffany at the Campsite,"I‚Äôm in my garage, looking at the camping gear I hadn‚Äôt touched since camping with my family last spring. It‚Äôs been sitting on top of my dad‚Äôs tool shelf looking deflated and lonely. Well, not anymore! I found out my family‚Äôs favorite campground has a new site open when my friend Tiffany told me last week. I‚Äôve been excited ever since, especially since I hadn‚Äôt camped in a while and haven‚Äôt seen her in a bit. We don‚Äôt have too long before graduation day inevitably comes.



I want to go for a hike and a night with my gear to remember just- everything about this place, the memories, the seasons, how I got inspired to start looking into being an arborist. The everythingness, as I call it. The everythingness of how there‚Äôs a last time for everything and everything shifts like the seasons. I remember the smell of my sheets, my books stacked with abandon on shelves in my bedroom, bacon in the morning, and and and-



‚ÄúAnd‚Äù is a lovely word, I think as I get the fucking bright idea to grab a dirty yardstick to coax down a duffle bag. The straps look like they‚Äôre smirking at me. Guess I‚Äôll have to get a ladder or something because that thing‚Äôs gonna knock over stuff on the bench. Ah well, I think to myself, ‚Äúand‚Äù is a lovely word because it means there‚Äôs always something else, and there‚Äôs not an end unless you put an ‚Äúand.‚Äù And I don‚Äôt want this spring to end.



I can hear Dad pull up to the driveway and I get him to help me bring my camping gear down. Damn, time sure has flown because we leave for the campsite tomorrow. I‚Äôm a good packer, and I‚Äôve done this a million times. At least I feel like I have. He tells me off about packing at the last minute. Guess I‚Äôve always been like that ya know, working best under pressure. It doesn‚Äôt feel like pressure though, it feels like I‚Äôm packing for my next big adventure, and this next adventure is about contemplation, soaking it all in before this chapter in my life inevitably passes once I graduate. And I‚Äôm going with Miss Tiffany Randolph whom I‚Äôve known since I met her in Girl Scouts. Tiffany is a nature mama who‚Äôs SO into it, the girl who can put up a professionally-built tent and bust on down any trail to see what we can find. A little bossy, but hey, I don‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs part of her charm.



It‚Äôs 8:30 am and the bed is too damn comfy, seems like a crime to leave it. Every. Single. Time. no matter how much ‚Äúpout time‚Äù I build in, getting up is still rough. Today is different because it‚Äôs MY day. I sit down in my rickety desk chair and look up the site again to check my reservation to make sure I got the right time. Seeing the addition of the new campsite still rests behind my eyes as a surreal haze or maybe it‚Äôs the 4 hours of sleep I got last night because of excitement. I shake my head and shrug it off. Oh well, my name and Tiff‚Äôs are there. I got the email confirmation from West Creek Campsite #11 at 2:00 pm. Huh, I had only ever seen 10 sites up for reservation, but ah well. The wood of the chair creaks as I lean back, suppose there‚Äôs a finality to this sound too. A last for everything and it sends a jolt of electric pain to my ribs that crackles for a second in my heart. Drawing in a breath, I feel tears nudging my eyes but shake it off. Just temporary. I won‚Äôt feel like this forever.



Before I know it, Dad and I are loading up the car with my camping gear and talking about nothing, and I can tell he‚Äôs nervous. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I say while giving a half-hearted smile, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one night, and I have my Bowie knife you gave me for Christmas!‚Äù



He gives me a small smirk, ‚ÄúAtta girl, Caroline. You‚Äôre my daughter afterall.‚Äù I can tell he‚Äôs pleased by the way his shoulders surrender their tension, ‚Äúbut take your .410, sweetie, don‚Äôt want no bears gettin‚Äô that close.‚Äù



Well shit, I‚Äôve always been nervous about the shotgun, he taught me a good ten or so times, but I hate how it punches my shoulder. The next breath leaves my lungs before I can register it, ‚ÄúSure sure, kinda don‚Äôt like it but I guess.‚Äù I shrug, taking it from my dad who‚Äôs gotten it out of the safe in the garage. ‚ÄúJust in case I meet anyone or- anything I guess, well ya know.‚Äù I trail off and there's no more need for anymore words because he pats me on the shoulder as he opens the passenger door for me.



With that, I think we have everything. I check my backpack for all the essentials, my phone for the reservation number, and off we go, bumping along the gravel road to the highway. Here‚Äôs to Caro‚Äôs next biggest adventure.



As we drive, I don‚Äôt need much to capture my attention but the tree-lined roads and the rainbow of junky mobile homes intermingled with McMansions on the highway to West Creek Campsite, sort of my home away from home. I could tell you how to get there we‚Äôve been so damn often. But why the new site? I know the summer‚Äôs busy and all, but I didn‚Äôt think it was THAT busy. To tell you the truth, I‚Äôm excited to see it. The little girl in me is jumping up and down.



Once the familiar check-in cabin rolls into my view, I text Tiffany, telling her that we made it and my dad and I *did not* kill each other arguing about the whole man vs. bear thing that‚Äôs going around right now. I can‚Äôt stop smiling, and I‚Äôm dragging my purse to my lap, prepping to get out as soon as we get there.



She texts back saying she‚Äôs getting there half an hour early to set up camp for us so it‚Äôs less work for me. Of course, because Miss Pattie at the front desk is her grandma and she gets free passes all the time. She texts ‚ÄúI gotchu bro I‚Äôll have it all ready when you check with Meemaw.‚Äù I chuckle to myself, always so proactive, and I can‚Äôt wait to meet up with her.



Dad pipes up, ‚ÄúThat your little friend Tiffany?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah yeah, she‚Äôs going on ahead and setting up,‚Äù and my heart does a little dance.



Dad and I go into the check-in cabin office and I pull up my reservation on my phone. Miss Pattie is there as usual with her baseball cap and grey-tinged ponytail poking out the back.



‚ÄúWell if it ain't Mizz Caroline, how you doing, baby? Good to see you too as always Mr. Johnston. My grandbaby Tiffany is waitin‚Äô for you at the new site. They just grow too fast! I remember when Olivia had her, was like yesterday.‚Äù



I grin and pull down on my hoodie that's caught my braid and pluck a stray, brown hair from my cheek, ‚ÄúHey Miss Pattie, yeah I remember I'm meeting her at the new site. Y'all opened up a new one?‚Äù I glance behind her and see a simple wooden frame with a photo inside. It‚Äôs of Tiffany for sure with her earthy hazel eyes, long blonde hair, and I think I remember she‚Äôs a little shorter than me judging by the girl she‚Äôs standing next to who‚Äôs a bit taller than me. It must‚Äôve not been taken too long ago because Tiff looks like she‚Äôs around my age in this one.



Miss Pattie chuckles and sighs, looking out the nearby window, ‚ÄúYeah, the summers get so busy here we thought we'd clear a little place further down the road. Folks wanted more trees and privacy.‚Äù I don't think I've ever seen Miss Pattie this expressive before. She's always been warm and welcoming, but there's a giddiness that makes me all the more excited to get going and meet my childhood bestie.



We finish checking in and wave Miss Pattie goodbye who grins and wipes away a tear. We hop back in the car and start following the signs to Camp #11. The gravel roads I know like the back of my hand at this point, but as we drive, a new-looking gravel path to my destination blooms in my eyes like the morning glory flowers that pepper our driveway. It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶new and well-pressed. They must really want to impress customers. Without thinking, I find my nose nearly pressed to the glass as we travel further down and further down, passing oaks, sycamores, catalpa, and wisteria that lovingly blankets their brethren‚Äôs leaves. This is what I came for.



But I couldn‚Äôt forget my other reason: Tiffany. The campsite is laid out before our sight with picnic tables, a bathroom facility, and it all looks so clean and brand-new. Raising my head up even higher, I see a small tent that nearly blends into the backdrop of gorgeous oaks, it looks like a mottled blue with a shine to it, it‚Äôs not so much a tent as it is a makeshift dwelling. Huh, well that‚Äôs weird, but maybe she‚Äôs not done setting up yet. And speaking of which, she seems to pop up from behind the car and waves to us, smooth, straight blonde hair billows out like a long cape. It‚Äôs so long it nearly touches her butt. I‚Äôve always loved her long hair.



‚ÄúOh my God, Caro!‚Äù Tiffany shouts out, her voice sounds like a feather, light and airy. Refreshing to the ears. And when our eyes meet, I can feel my cheeks flush as my gaze floats in her eyes, green as the leaves above us, I guess her hazel eyes turn green in the light, and the grass surrendering beneath her feet. Dad rolls down the window and leans his elbow out.



‚ÄúHeyyyy Tiffany, glad to see you!‚Äù He waves to her in a jovial manner, ‚Äúso how‚Äôs that new school you transferred to?‚Äù



Tiffany giggles, adjusts her worn-out looking Nirvana tee and looks more at me than him, she sports some camo cargo pants too, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs all good. I‚Äôve just missed Caro so much I wanted to take a trip back here.‚Äù I can‚Äôt look away. I don‚Äôt want to.



My turn, I don‚Äôt let him reply, ‚ÄúAnd I love how we‚Äôre able to meet up after all these years, will be good to walk the woods like we used to.‚Äù



I look away, up to the sky of leaves, clouds, and possibilities before remembering I actually have to get my stuff out of the car. Shuffling around and undoing my seatbelt, I look back up to see Tiff still looking at me, almost pleadingly. I waste no more seconds as I sweep the stuff into my arms and clamber out, nearly tripping over a root but righting myself. My bestie giggles and holds out her hands as Dad gets out and jogs over to the trunk to fetch out my tent.



‚ÄúHey you,‚Äù she says, drawing me into a hug. Can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt melt just a little and feel like everything in the world is ok. She holds me close. I‚Äôm kinda surprised that her grip is relatively firm and solid. Ya know, not painful but present, with a quiet and enticing intensity. It feels divine to be this firmly chosen, and I let out the breath I didn‚Äôt know I was holding. I feel like I‚Äôm in bed, never wanting to leave.



‚ÄúCould you ladies come help me get the food and stuff to your spot. Need a hand here if ya don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù Dad calls to us. Tiffany's brows perk up. They‚Äôre darker than her blonde hair. Heh, maybe she‚Äôs trying to imitate Cara Delevigne and never let go of the bold brow trend of 2016 like I never want to let go of her.



With a sigh, we unlace ourselves from one another, and stitch our collective attention to Dad. Tiff does most of the work, boldly gathering stuff under her arm and over her shoulder. Lady must work out, like damn! Color me impressed. Ok, muscle mommy! I blush and feel the crunch of acorns under my boots as we head to her tent. I can‚Äôt take my eyes off of it either.



And it‚Äôs a‚Ä¶..worn-out tarp. Branches are shoddily tied to the tarp with weather-worn twine, looking like a breeze could uproot it all. Didn‚Äôt she go camping often? Didn‚Äôt she fly through Girl Scouts? Maybe today was stressful, but there‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt ignore about it. We set up my tent in no time and arrange my gear, nothing too much of note. Once I see it up close, it looks like the tarp is pretty dirty. I shrug, must be what she had to bring or maybe she‚Äôs looking for a true outdoorsy experience. Curious, I peer inside and see an old towel barely covering half the ground that‚Äôs badly frayed at the ends, halfway embedded in the ground. Leaning over even more, I don‚Äôt think I can see all the way into it, but it‚Äôs pretty rude to go snooping through others‚Äô stuff. Truth be told, it gives me the ick. Back to Tiff, but what a contrast to her and whatever the hell flimsy shit she made.



I hear Tiff laugh at one of my Dad‚Äôs dad jokes, and as she does, her eyes enlist all of my attention, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be ok, I promise Mr. Johnston.‚Äù



Dad scratches his head and wipes some sweat off his brow, ‚ÄúNo need to be so formal Tiffany, call me Pete. You‚Äôre old enough now. You nervous or sumthin‚Äô?‚Äù



I can‚Äôt read her, Tiffany's gaze still pierces mine but it‚Äôs somehow far away at the same time and she smiles at him, ‚ÄúNo I um, just not used to calling you that.‚Äù She says it with a certain stiffness I can‚Äôt place.



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry ‚Äòbout it hun,‚Äù Dad pats her on the back and she seems to force a smile while once again, giving me a sort of pleading look. I can‚Äôt help but walk closer to her and put my arm around her waist. She seems to soften and relax into my touch, looking at me while she replies to Dad, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no trouble.‚Äù



Once we‚Äôre sure everything is in place, Dad gives me a hug real tight. A familiar sadness balls up in my chest, but it‚Äôs soon replaced when Tiffany gives me the biggest grin and grabs my hand, eager to start our trip together. His car creates puffs of dust in its wake as he disappears down the path and out of my sight.



Tiffany and I are alone.



Chapter 2



Without Dad there, I can focus on her completely. Looking closer, I can tell she‚Äôs done some makeup. Tiff looks up at me with long lashes with what looks to be smudged dark eye makeup that looks to have been hastily applied or maybe slept in, like she woke up late, rubbed her eyes and barely made it out here, or maybe she just forgot to take it off. Her eyes are looking particularly green today, very green. Such a beautiful green.



‚ÄúI like your makeup, wanted to look good for me, huh?‚Äù I remark, watching her expression carefully, ‚Äúdid you try some contacts?‚Äù



She shrugs, looking at me with placid green eyes, rather unbothered, ‚ÄúOh sure, I like it, makes me feel more human on these days out in the woods,‚Äù she giggles and I‚Äôm soon to follow. I sure know that feeling when it‚Äôs nice to slap on a little something to feel more put together and feminine.



‚ÄúOk, Miss Fairy Princess,‚Äù I chuckle, patting her awkwardly on the shoulder, ‚Äúand I suppose you got your setup over there from shit just stuck to a tree?‚Äù



Tiffany doesn‚Äôt speak, she doesn‚Äôt take her eyes off of mine, and when my next breath finds its way into my lungs, she leans against me and seems to make herself smaller underneath my arm, ‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù she coos, ‚Äúthen if it falls down you‚Äôll just have to help me. You were always better at this stuff than me.‚Äù



‚ÄúHeh, cheeky. But you‚Äôre like way faster at this and stronger than me. No excuse!‚Äù My body decides to twitch as if I got stung by a wayward nettle. She never answered the question and it‚Äôs kinda pissing me off. Yeah she can be a bit of a brat, but this is just hitting me weird. No, I‚Äôm not better at this than her.



She frowns with a slight pout, unhappy with my response, ‚Äúand let‚Äôs go shopping later too, these are just what I could find.‚Äù I glance at my tent, placed across from hers. I hate how it keeps yawning like a toothy maw into my vision. The breeze isn‚Äôt the reason I shudder. And again, maybe she‚Äôs nervous or a little tired because she‚Äôd usually be popping up like a rocket to go explore the woods and see what kind of mischief we could get into. The Tiffany right underneath my arm, implores me with both a sense of wonder and a beckoning that I can‚Äôt place.



My mind pops back into reality where her response hangs in the air and seems to trail off into nothingness. I grab it, ‚ÄúFind where?‚Äù I asked her, curiosity piqued.



She looks up at me with eyes that dance in the sunlight, beckoning me to relax my eyes that are still trained on the tent and guiding my gaze back to hers, ‚ÄúEh, well, a thrift store, but I was out earlier exploring and fell. Silly me!‚Äù She giggles, and if it wasn‚Äôt the damn cutest sound.



What I had noticed before became more evident now as the shirt looks like it has several holes, and on the side with some dirty finger marks towards the bottom. More holes than a simple fall or two might make but who the hell was I to judge? Tiff loves exploring. Her pants seem a bit newer but dirty as well, as if she‚Äôd been already hiking around. It‚Äôs in sharp contrast to her neatly-done hair, messy yet feminine makeup. I feel myself sucking in my slight tummy pooch and patting my braid, making sure it still looks how I want it.



Tiffany‚Äôs pupils dilate for a moment, and for that moment she nestles herself beneath my arm, smiling and looking up at me, awaiting to be directed. It‚Äôs clear she wants me to say something, move or do something. A sigh I didn‚Äôt expect slips out and a heaviness makes bricks with my blood.



I squeeze her again and start to stretch, ‚ÄúOh yeah, let‚Äôs get some kindling for the firewood for s‚Äômores tonight, you \*know\* I brought supplies!‚Äù I shrug off everything I think is a bit too eccentric for my taste. Sure, I like some quirks, but I‚Äôm not certain what changed about Tiff since we last saw each other. I‚Äôm not sure why that tent looks like it‚Äôs been here longer than her and why she did a hack-job. I draw in a breath that clenches my heart because at the same time, I feel she‚Äôs somehow unreachable, like somewhere along the line our friendship changed beneath all the hyped-up texts and promises. And I feel alone for the first time in a while, even when I want so desperately to be by her side and be in a better mood than what I‚Äôve shifted into now.



And I don‚Äôt know what I can do to bring it all back.



Darkness begins blanketing the sky. It seems like it‚Äôs only been an hour. But whatever, we have to get kindling for the fire because in the mountains, the nights can be chilly. I start getting up, and I want to see her jump up to come with me.¬†



‚ÄúSo nice here with you, my sweet Caroline, are you getting the kindling for me?‚Äù She lays down in the grass, once again looking unbothered but fatigued. Her voice keeps getting softer. Annoyed, I sigh to myself. I was hoping she‚Äôd want to help and catch up with me after all this time and come with me, not to order me around. She‚Äôs lucky she‚Äôs damn gorgeous.



‚ÄúHey hey, you ok? Worn out from earlier?‚Äù She nods in response, closing her eyes.



‚ÄúYeah, just let me rest my eyes, I had a really late lunch, so kinda have a food coma,‚Äù Tiffany nearly whispers. Fine, whatever. Looking for my shotgun, I pull out a flashlight to search for it, wondering where it went off to during the flurry of unpacking and setting up. I see it leaning up against her tent.



Dodging the small grill we had set up and backpack, I make my way to her tent. In the moonlight, the tent‚Äôs interior looks even darker than the night with the frayed edges of the towel drifting out just beyond its reaches like a tongue and teeth. I don‚Äôt want to fucking touch it. I want to get my shotgun and get our firewood and just have a nice night with my friend without feeling like this. Yet, I can‚Äôt look away. Grabbing it as quickly as I can muster, I jog into the woods with my flashlight and shake out my shoulders. Some tears find their way into the corner of my eyes as I go out into the forest alone. Maybe I just need a moment, and I almost scream because this isn‚Äôt how it‚Äôs supposed to go. What the hell happened to the Tiffany I know who has a spark for life no mood or any amount of tiredness could extinguish?¬†



Kindling is easy to find on the ground, it hasn‚Äôt rained in a while so finding dry sticks is a simple task. And it‚Äôs dark, like deepwoods country dark. Still, the moonlight casts the trees around me as sinewy wraiths in their interplay. Dammit, she got Sweet Caroline stuck in my head! Better than getting completely spooked out here. My thoughts keep running and running, feeling like a pressure behind my eyes with a sort of haze, a sort of gnawing.



Remembering my phone that‚Äôs in my pocket, I bring it out, and the light is a welcome site. Oh fuck yet again, I had forgotten to charge it in Dad‚Äôs car so it‚Äôs at like 5%. Well, I just won‚Äôt use it, don‚Äôt need it out here. I don‚Äôt need it out here with Tiffany since we‚Äôre just catching up and getting back to nature like old times. Yeah like old times with her laying passively on the ground because it‚Äôs SO like her to do that! Jesus H. Christ!

  


And the farther I go, the more I think of how I‚Äôm damning her so much for being tired and maybe feeling off. I might just be reacting to her like an asshole so I take another breath and think how she might be more rested once I get back and be ready to devour some s‚Äômores and tell some jokes that‚Äôs so normal for her. Just need to have faith and some patience, Caro. She‚Äôll come around. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll be happy I got kindling for us and she‚Äôll be her usual peppy self ready to help.



And I can‚Äôt think of anyone but her and how sweet her voice is, how her green eyes peer into mine and lay me bare to the elements. I turn around because I‚Äôve gone far enough and have to see her and hear her, and I hope she‚Äôs recovered. I hear the crunch of leaves under my feet as I trace my path back to Tiffany, though I can‚Äôt help but think why her eyes are green when they‚Äôre normally hazel? She didn‚Äôt answer the contacts question, and it‚Äôs so fucking weird, but I gotta get back and see her.



As the dim lights pepper the campsite, there seems to be fewer trees in my way to see the woman I can‚Äôt bear to be away from. The triangle of her tent materializes into view, and Tiffany is there, Tiffany is standing. Tiffany's eyes are on me.



Her eyes are such a light green that they normally disappear into her face from afar almost, but what was pleasant, relaxed green has been replaced by piercing black. Some trees stand between me, her and her tent I‚Äôve now realized she‚Äôs standing in front of, tall, strong, and unmoving. Taller than before. I stop still at the treeline, slowing down my breathing and with a moment of clarity, I remember her picture back behind Miss Pattie, and though the photo had been sun-worn, Tiffany has brown eyes, not this almost unnatural green. Whoever this is before me is neither my childhood friend nor Miss Pattie‚Äôs granddaughter. Her eyes were wrong, even more wrong now. They aren‚Äôt an earthy hazel or even the leaf green from before but an unfeeling, unfathomable, and unknowable black. She was never this coy and coquettish. My gut was right. I don‚Äôt know who this is, and I have to figure it out. Or maybe I‚Äôm just having a weird icky moment here in the dark and my mind is playing tricks, but still, something is wrong. I don‚Äôt want to even take a fucking step, but I know she needs me. I‚Äôm not even sure if this is even a girl or some creepo dude who‚Äôs been stalking me. It doesn‚Äôt matter because I have to fucking figure this shitshow out right now.

¬†

‚ÄúOh Caro, you scared me, I was looking out for you. I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre back. L-let‚Äôs get the s‚Äômores going!‚Äù There‚Äôs a tremor in her voice, but she maintains the charm and girlish coquettishness she so graciously fed to me earlier. I‚Äôm not having it, Tiff would normally be rushing to help me and take charge. She makes no move to approach me or help prepare the fire. Tiffany simply stands almost defensively in front of her tent watching me. Just. Fucking. Watching.



I stand my ground, unmoving like her. At this point, it‚Äôs best to bluff and act like nothing‚Äôs off. Go on like I‚Äôm excited to be back by her side. I‚Äôm not so sure I can fake it because of how I stopped and clearly noticed. I think she‚Äôs also sensed my hesitation and makes no move to help.



I know.



Whatever I say next has to be progress or a distraction. But what do I do? My heart grasps at my throat, and I can hardly think. If I swing my shotgun around to the front she‚Äôll know I know. Dad told me to be unbothered in times like this, don‚Äôt let them know you‚Äôre afraid.

So I don‚Äôt, ‚ÄúHey Tiff,‚Äù I begin, hoping to God I don‚Äôt sound afraid, ‚Äúhey I got the kindling, but I gotta fix something.‚Äù



My tent is the one closest to the road, and if I can make it look like I‚Äôm fixing a stake and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù something I need back at reception, then I can walk there. If Tiff comes with, she could still overtake me. She probably won‚Äôt buy it. If she does attack me then I could just incapacitate her and run and have a reason. I don‚Äôt want to ever have a reason, but here we are.



Tiff is still just in front of her tent, and her long limbs cast sinewy shadows from underneath the little lighting we have here. Long, sinewy, waif-like. Long, sinewy, and watching my every move.



‚ÄúYour tent is just fine, Caroline, I checked it for you,‚Äù and it‚Äôs at this point, with the overly formal language and shift in demeanor from submissive to commanding, I know this isn‚Äôt Tiffany Jessica Randolph.



I lock eyes with this creep and unblinkingly swivel the shotgun so I‚Äôm holding it like a minuteman, finger tracking straight above the trigger and holding the barrel in the other hand. There‚Äôs another shift in Creep‚Äôs demeanor yet again, she reverts back to the eerie coquettish behavior from before and slumps to the ground, crying.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Caro, I scared you. I didn‚Äôt mean to! Why are you avoiding me? Is it something I‚Äôm doing wrong? Please come here and let‚Äôs start the fire together, ok? Please put the gun down!‚Äù Her form seems far smaller, crumpled on the ground as she sobs into her hands, but when she picks her head up, her pupils are still dominating her eyes in captive horror.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, Tiff, you didn‚Äôt scare me, I might've dropped something where Dad's car was,‚Äù and that's all I have. Dad's car was parked closer to the entrance when he dropped me off, and I start backing up that way, never taking my eyes off of Creep who immediately stops crying and stands with an uncanny grace.



Yet I want her to smile when she rises to greet our silence, I want to see her warm, hazel eyes and goofy spirit. I want Tiffany, but I don‚Äôt want whoever is drawing me into their little fantasy or whatever the fuck is going on here. And I can feel it again, chewing at the edges of my mind, and I think how I‚Äôm being too paranoid. She looks so cold and sad over there. I draw in a deep, shuddering breath, every hair rising to meet the moon. My flashlight is in my BDU‚Äôs.



It‚Äôs a Maglight so you know the beacon of God is gonna light this stalker creep‚Äôs face to high heaven, and it might just grant me a second to start booking it out of Creepo Dodge.

Each and every hair, each and every cell, and each and every crumb of my being freezes when I click the light on his/her/its face. What had been beautiful skin is now growing taught, dry and seemingly melting from Creep‚Äôs face like it‚Äôs actively aging 60 years. Their eyelids begin sagging and turning a rash-like red, puffing out then dragging down and down and down and- the eyes are what make me raise my shotgun next. The eyes are completely blacked out with tendrils of black overflowing from the corners. It screams when the light hits its face and reels backwards but quickly recovers and starts moving in jerking, inhuman motions towards me.



I have one shell in the chamber.



Chapter 3



Danger can feel like the nightmares you‚Äôd have where time slows and turns your feet into mud and voice into a death rattle. It‚Äôs real now and surreal. If I don‚Äôt shoot I‚Äôm dead. I take the shot and at the last second, my arms shake down too much and it rips through the thing‚Äôs leg. Screams explode from its mouth, and I‚Äôm frozen, vaguely hearing what must be the chunk of calf hurtle sideways into the forest and I hear as the blood re-dyes my tent nearby with clattering splatters. And it‚Äôs crawling. The shotgun blast was so loud I stumble back, deaf from all the world‚Äôs noise, but my eyes are enough.



And now my legs move, and I use every fucking ounce of muscle to turn tail and rocket down the gravel pathway, not daring to look back as I can hear it shrieking in both pain and something else: frustration but only sort of in one ear. I run and run. I run down the connecting road and down and down and down. I still have my shotgun tightly woven in my hands as my legs plead me to stop. I can‚Äôt stop. I have to get out of this fucking camp. Better that my hearing is fucked for life rather than being dead.



Tiffany's voice is almost inaudible now. Her screams rip through my heart. They‚Äôve changed. Her screams are of loss, grief, sadness. The chewing returns, and it‚Äôs more of a gnawing, burrowing sensation that goads me to turn around and look. Just look to see if your childhood friend is ok, it says. She‚Äôll be ok if I go back and care for her.



‚ÄúSTOP IT!‚Äù I yell into the night‚Äôs windless air, barely hearing even myself as my ears ring, ping, and plink. Tears capture my face, ‚ÄúYOU DON‚ÄôT CONTROL ME!‚Äù



A different sort of danger grips my psyche as I push through and run until I recognize that I‚Äôm getting closer to the check-in cabin and I can‚Äôt hear the thing screaming anymore. Thank God I know this place like the back of my hand. No matter what is happening in my mind, I have to get out of this campsite and-



And find anyone, just anyone who could get me out of here alive.



My right knee buckles as I collapse to the ground as I see headlights and the squeal of brakes as my shotgun clatters to the asphalt. The headlights veer off to the shoulder and I hear a car door open, the sound of running galloping in my ears. Looking up, I can see it‚Äôs Park Ranger Kelly who immediately stoops down to me.



‚ÄúOh my God, are you ok?‚Äù I don‚Äôt see her but I feel a pressure on my shoulder, urging me to look up at her and answer. The asphalt smells like rain as I fall backwards into her arms and start struggling to stand up, heart and lungs in my throat. I hear another truck pull up behind us. When whoever opens the door, Kelly turns a bit towards them, and I hear a man saying something about a gunshot. Kelly says she‚Äôs got this so he should go back and check out Site 8 nearby.



‚ÄúI-I-I‚Äù the words won‚Äôt form, I just want to get out, ‚Äúwe have to go NOW. Kelly please, please.‚Äù Blackened irises flash in my momentarily shuttered eyes and I can‚Äôt tell you how much I want to just run.



‚ÄúHey hey hey,‚Äù she steadies my shoulders and catches me, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get you back to headquarters, we heard a gunshot and had to come check it out,‚Äù I can tell she now catches sight of my shotgun nearly falling off the washed-out shoulder of the road and pauses, saying nothing more but helping me to my feet and carefully picking up the shotgun. My feet flop against the asphalt and I must look behind me.



I don‚Äôt hear or see anything, but I must look.



But I have to get in the car, safe with Kelly.



Before leaving to check out the other camp, the man helps Kelly get me into the passenger seat of her white F-150, beige leather seats sunken and worn from much use as she places my shotgun on the backseat floor. Not long after, the man gets back in his truck and pulls away. I claw at my face, my head, my hair. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs asking me anything at this point, but we begin moving and finally, the heavy sobs that punch my gut then pierce the air.



We make it to the check-in cabin, and Kelly helps me out and tells me to go inside while she searches for her phone she thinks she dropped. Once inside, I collapse onto a leather chair and I‚Äôm not sure I can talk. If I talk I‚Äôll see it again and hear it calling. The door opens, Kelly gives me a sympathetic nod and hands me a tissue from the nearby coffee table.



‚ÄúW-was gonna‚Ä¶meet Tiffany,‚Äù I almost whisper, ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt Tiffany.‚Äù If I dare look Kelly in the eye I‚Äôll fucking scream so I try through tears and my body shaking, my hands clawing at my thighs, ‚Äúnot Tiffany.‚Äù It‚Äôs all I can do. How am I supposed to tell her really what I saw? No one would believe me, and I can‚Äôt screw myself by saying I shot whoever the fuck that was.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, Caroline, how was she not Tiffany? We had you both on record you two were staying at Site 11. Can you tell me a little more?‚Äù



I shake my head, the sobs drumming their beat out of my ribs yet again, ‚ÄúI wanna go home!‚Äù



I can tell Kelly is at a loss because it takes her a minute to respond, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm going to have the police come check it out. They‚Äôll find Tiffany and take care of everything, and I‚Äôll be here for you, ok?‚Äù



Every single bone in my body screeches and my blood burns my veins, ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù I can‚Äôt stop from screaming, ‚ÄúNO, that thing will attack them!‚Äù And when I look Kelly in the eye I can see her pupils grow wider and wider still. I blink and they‚Äôre back to a calm blue. I‚Äôm fucking paranoid now and seeing shit.



The next moments are a blur as I hold onto her shoulder like a child while she dials the police. My useless murmurings are met with a calm but firm voice that runs together. Soon enough, I see the reflection of lights pulling up to the cabin. In a moment of clarity, I fully realize how fucked this situation is: I have zero proof as to what I saw and no way of proving that who I met up with wasn‚Äôt Tiffany and how it almost attacked me. Best to shut up and let the police do their search, but I shudder at that thing that‚Äôs probably recovering and waiting for either me or some hapless someone to show up. I just have to deal. I just have to not talk to them. I still don‚Äôt know what happened to Tiffany.



So I call her.



Her phone rings and goes to voicemail, or rather it goes to the message saying the voice box or whatever hasn‚Äôt been set up yet. I send her a text too, telling her what happened and asking if she‚Äôs ok. I try calling again just in case, but it‚Äôs the same deal. A black void opens in my stomach and my hopes are dragged through what feels like an endless black portal.



It‚Äôs not long before three, I don‚Äôt know, maybe 4 cars show up and they‚Äôre bursting through the door and start badgering me with questions that come at me too fast. I stare at the floor with my knuckles turning white, paralyzed with indecision. What \*could\* I tell them? Sure as hell can‚Äôt say I shot someone but I am the one with the shotgun. Do I make up something? Shaking my head, I just can‚Äôt lie. If Tiffany is to be found and vindicated then I need to say something. My mouth won‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt want to meet their eyes.



‚ÄúI-I,‚Äù I can barely choke the words out as the memory of the thing‚Äôs eyes violate my mind, ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt Tiffany Randolph‚Ä¶it was someone else.‚Äù I stop there, saying I shot someone would be bad. Thank God the shotgun is in Kelly‚Äôs car.



What I think is an officer kneels at my side, attempting to capture my floor-bound gaze, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, it‚Äôs ok, we‚Äôll find your friend. Can you tell me your name first? We‚Äôre here to help you.‚Äù



I will not look him in the eye, ‚ÄúCaroline Johnston.‚Äù I wrap my arms around myself and tears started arresting my vision, making the old, worn-out floorboards and the shadows the people cast look like demons twisting with breaking bones and gnashing teeth.



Another one pipes up, ‚ÄúWe understand you might not feel like talking to us,‚Äù and the voice trails off as Kelly shares what I‚Äôve told her and a few start going back outside. I hear car doors and engines engaging as a few cars start down the road. Down to Site 11. Down to where they might not be as lucky as me.



But I can‚Äôt move from looking at the floor. I have no energy to yell for them to stop, that there‚Äôs a \*thing\* stronger than them. But they have to try to find Tiffany. And after that moment when the policemen leave, I noticed Kelly hasn‚Äôt moved from her station at the door. I can feel her eyes on me, probably worried and wondering what to do. I haven‚Äôt exactly been cooperative.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù she starts to say, ‚ÄúI should have gotten to you sooner.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù And I pick my head up to look at her, the same thing happens again and my blood freezes, her pupils look too dilated. I blink and she‚Äôs smiling. I can‚Äôt not look now. My eyes and attention are her prisoners. Just outside, through the screened window on the door, I notice she had left her truck running. The moonlight seems to stop short of the windows.



I snap my head back to the floor, this has me SO fucked I‚Äôm still seeing that creep‚Äôs eyes. It‚Äôs everywhere now. Of course she wished she had intervened before shit got crazy.



‚ÄúCaroline, I‚Äôm so sorry, but let me take you home, ok?‚Äù



I can hear the heavy thud of her boots against the floor as she kneels in front of me. I start sobbing helplessing in my hands, feeling the humid air heat up my face. I reach out and grasp at her shoulders, falling chest-first into her arms. I just want to be home with Dad and for this to be over for good.



‚ÄúCaroline,‚Äù Kelly says in a soft voice, and I smell her sweet yet musky, fresh perfume that‚Äôs calming my heart rate, relaxing into her embrace, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be ok, you‚Äôre ok. Isn‚Äôt your dad worried about you?‚Äù



‚ÄúI-I oh my God, Kelly. My dad doesn‚Äôt know yet. Oh God, I need to call him!‚Äù The tears freely flow and she holds me in a tight, steady embrace, and this moment seems suspended in time as I let loose all the emotions I was holding back from when the police came.



‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt,‚Äù Kelly‚Äôs voice lowers in register as her grip tightens on me. She grabs my jaw and forces me to meet her eyes. There is only the night and all-consuming black. And my tears fall down and down and down as she drags me off the chair. I can‚Äôt stop crying. I can‚Äôt stop looking as her skin seems to become drawn and quartered across her face.



As the skin beneath her eyes sags.



As my breath releases itself from my lungs as my back hits the floor and the light closes its chapter from my eyes.

1m67u10,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m67u10/my_story/,My story‚Ä¶.,"Hi guys,

It‚Äôs my first time posting here, and I was hoping to use this platform as a means to reflect and talk about my recent relationship. I‚Äôm a 26M, and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, though I‚Äôve dated a little until I met her.

We met in November last year through a dating app, and long story short, we instantly clicked. The chemistry was undeniable, and the banter just flowed. What started as a simple dinner and coffee date stretched into after-drinks until 1 a.m. I offered to drop her home, and we both knew at that moment this was something good. We met again just a few days later for an outdoor activity and a casual dinner. It became a cycle of constantly wanting to see each other. We used to hang out at the cafe near her place till the early hours of the morning.

A month after dating, it was my birthday. She wrote me a heartfelt note expressing how much she liked me and surprised me with a cake and a personalized gift. I was honestly taken aback. I‚Äôd never received such thoughtful gestures before. I went over to her place on Christmas night and fell asleep by her side. Having recently lost someone close to me before meeting her, moments like that, lying on her lap, felt warm and comforting. At one point, she even said, ‚ÄúAnytime you feel lonely, just come back here.‚Äù

When the new year started, we became official. Up until that point, we had been exploring cafes and sharing goofy, intimate moments together. That‚Äôs when things slowly started to shift.

A couple of weeks before Valentine‚Äôs Day, we were at a cafe talking, and the topic of past relationships came up. I was already aware of her dating history, and she knew about mine. She had a boyfriend at 17 for a year, and everything after that was casual, mostly one-night stands. The most recent ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù before me was a FWB situation that lasted over a year. I had learned about all of this just a few weeks into us dating.

But that night, something rubbed me the wrong way. She casually mentioned that she was still in touch with her previous FWB. They still followed each other, exchanged memes, and shared life updates. As someone new to relationships, I started questioning boundaries and what‚Äôs acceptable. She also said she wasn‚Äôt ready for sex, that it takes her a long time with someone, which felt odd given her past. That said, we were intimate in other ways, just not fully.

I brought up my discomfort, and she reassured me that if anything crossed a line, she‚Äôd be upfront about it. I took her word for it. The next day, she left for her hometown for about a week. During that time, I felt a subtle shift in my own energy. Even though I told myself I trusted her, deep down I had a gut feeling something felt off. I‚Äôll admit, I come from a background where trusting others hasn‚Äôt always been easy. I‚Äôve grown better at it over the years, but I still have work to do.

With her out of town, I realized how much I missed her. When she came back, I planned something for Valentine‚Äôs Day. We had dinner, and I gave her a box of chocolates and a heartfelt poem I wrote about how much I adored and loved her. She laughed and called it cheesy in a joking way. We laughed it off and went for drinks after. That‚Äôs when she said something like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what it is about me that you love, but you deserve someone better.‚Äù I can‚Äôt quite remember how I responded, but that was the moment I felt her energy shift. When I dropped her off, she asked me not to stay over because she was tired and wanted a good night‚Äôs sleep. I respected that and left.

From then on, I felt the distance between us growing. Texts became rare. We‚Äôd go days without any messages. I saw her once a week, sometimes twice, but the emotional connection felt like it was fading. It was mostly me putting in the effort to keep things going. A week after Valentine‚Äôs, we met for lunch. That‚Äôs when she told me we were moving too fast, and that liking someone is different from loving them. She didn‚Äôt feel the latter with me yet. She said she‚Äôd give it three more months to see if her feelings would change. As tough as it was to hear, it made sense. I also felt we were moving fast, but honestly, the pace was set by her in the beginning. The notes, the gifts, the affection, it all led me to believe this was something serious.

As the months passed, the hot-and-cold behavior continued through texts and even in person. Some days it felt like I was with a stranger. The spark in her eyes was gone. Eventually, after six months, I received a long text from her. She said she wanted to end things because she felt pressured and simply didn‚Äôt feel the same way about me. She didn‚Äôt want to lead me on and wanted me to be with someone who could match my energy and emotions. As heartbreaking as it was, I was kind of expecting it. She offered her friendship, but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm particularly looking for with her. I accepted it and moved on. It still breaks my heart that she ended things over text instead of meeting up in person, but I can‚Äôt do much about that now.

It‚Äôs been two months since the breakup. I‚Äôve been occupying myself with travel and work, and it has helped. Despite the pain, I‚Äôm grateful. It was fun being in a relationship and finally understanding what it means to love and be loved, even if it was just for a short while. I‚Äôm fully aware now that I need to slow myself down and not get attached to people too quickly. There‚Äôs value in pacing myself and letting things unfold naturally.

Are you going to do your job!??,"Those are the magical words that were uttered to me yesterday morning. Now, I hate loaded questions. I've worked retail and hospitality, and it gets old fast. Just be polite and direct and let me know what the issue is. 

""Excuse me!? Are you going to do your job!??"" She has the Karen haircut as well. 

I look at her and say, ""that's a rather vague statement. Can you tell me what is wrong?""

""Yeah, I just want to know if you're going to do your job.""

Now, clearly she means the coffee is out. I get that. However, sometimes you have to make rude adults use their words. You also have to know when to pick your battles. So I walk over there and go, ""I see that the coffee is out. I'm not sure what was so hard about that."" Then a beeping goes off the signals a fresh batch is made. ""That would be the fresh batch of coffee. That's me doing my job.""

So I go to get the new urn and I hear the Karen say, ""seems like the help isn't so helpful."" I brush it off because I'm giddy in the fact that if she continues to keep the attitude up, I'm just going to cancel her reservation. Except, she doesn't stop.

""See, what was so hard about that? It's not rocket science to get more coffee."" 

I'm going through the rest of the breakfast area because I like to stock items ideally *before* they run out. Unless I'm busy, which happens. Karen see's this and says, ""I just don't understand what was so hard about getting coffee if you're seemingly smart enough to stock everything else.""

Okay, I'm going to give it to her. 

""Ma'am, I know how to do my job, okay? Also, we aren't hiring at the hotel at the moment, nor would we hire you. Secondly, the coffee tends to run out because it's not an infinite source of coffee. It would be great if it were, however it is not. Thirdly, I was busy okay? Breakfast is not the only thing that I have to contend with. Lastly, the coffee running out, even though I usually refill it immediately, is partially due to people such as yourself refusing to read the signs at the coffee station that says, 'FOR SINGLE USE CUPS ONLY. NO THERMOSES OR TALL CUPS.' Which is what you and your group were using. So all of your childish remarks are going to end now, or you'll be made to leave the property.""",34,1753169421.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,12,0.96,False

In recent years, the world of pet journalism has expanded with stunning magazine covers, insightful content, and features that cater to pet owners, especially dog enthusiasts. Whether you‚Äôre a dog parent in Noida or simply passionate about pet grooming and canine care, the growing selection of dog magazines offers something for everyone.

# The Allure of Pet Magazine Covers

What draws attention on the magazine rack? A powerful cover. Dog magazine covers today go beyond just cute puppy photos. They‚Äôre styled like fashion spreads, often highlighting dog breeds in seasonal attire, celebrating special days like National Pet Day, or showcasing rescue stories that tug at the heart. A great cover can influence purchasing decisions and set the tone for what‚Äôs inside‚Äîa mix of emotional connection and informational value.

From golden retrievers gleaming in the sun to majestic huskies posed in winter landscapes, pet magazine covers reflect not only the charm of the dog featured but also the professionalism behind the shoot. This has led to a rise in dog modeling, pet photography, and even regional contests that help dogs make it to the cover page. In cities like Noida, where pet culture is booming, local magazines are also catching on to this trend.

# Dog Magazines in Noida: A Growing Trend

Noida has seen a sharp rise in pet ownership, with pet cafes, dog parks, and pet grooming salons opening in several neighborhoods. This growing community has spurred a demand for reading material that resonates with modern pet parenting. Dog magazines in Noida now cater to readers looking for breed-specific advice, health tips, grooming suggestions, and even pet travel guides.

Local dog magazines are increasingly collaborating with veterinarians, groomers, trainers, and behaviorists to create content that‚Äôs both trustworthy and engaging. Noida-based pet influencers also play a role in shaping content by contributing real-life experiences, reviews of pet products, and tips for new dog parents.

# Dog Grooming Features: More Than Just Looks

Grooming has evolved from a basic necessity to an art form. Today‚Äôs dog grooming stories in pet magazines often feature expert interviews, product reviews, and grooming transformations that highlight just how much grooming impacts a dog‚Äôs health and happiness. Regular grooming prevents infections, keeps the coat healthy, and improves overall well-being.

Top dog grooming tips frequently covered include how to choose the right shampoo based on coat type, the benefits of professional versus at-home grooming, and seasonal grooming checklists. For pet parents in Noida, where summer heat can be intense, dog magazines also offer localized advice‚Äîsuch as how to keep paws safe from hot pavements and which cuts are ideal for hot weather.

# The Role of Magazines in the Pet Community

Pet magazines serve a deeper purpose than just reading material‚Äîthey act as bridges between pet owners and service providers. From connecting readers to local adoption drives to spotlighting animal welfare organizations, magazines help build a community.

One standout publication that has gained recognition for supporting the pet ecosystem is *buddylifemagazine*. With its elegant covers, high-quality photography, and features that touch every aspect of dog parenting‚Äîfrom nutrition to emotional well-being‚Äîit has become a must-read for dog lovers across the country.

Whether you're a first-time dog owner or a seasoned pet parent, flipping through the pages of a thoughtful dog magazine can be as enriching for you as a walk in the park is for your pup.

# In Conclusion

Pet magazines are more than coffee table accessories‚Äîthey‚Äôre guides, companions, and storytellers in the journey of pet parenting. From eye-catching dog magazine covers to expert grooming advice tailored for places like Noida, these publications offer practical insights with heart.

For those seeking both inspiration and information, *buddylifemagazine* remains a trusted source‚Äîreminding us that when it comes to dogs, there's always more to learn, celebrate, and love.

In the background, fiery orbs of St. Elmo‚Äôs Light burn in hues of orange and red‚Äîcircular and intense like wasp fireballs. These were once seen as omens or divine signals, guiding vessels through darkness. Yet here, they flicker not as saviors, but as silent witnesses to tragedy. | Medium: Acrylic on canvas | Dimension 16x20? Rectangular Portrait

I‚Äôve always been close to my colleague, Steve (32M). We joke a lot, grab coffee together, and people often tease that I‚Äôm his ‚Äúwork wife‚Äù. I honestly never thought anything of it. He‚Äôs married with two kids and I‚Äôve met his wife at office parties.
Last week, during lunch, a group of us were joking about our ‚Äúoffice spouses‚Äù and his wife happened to call. He put her on speaker and someone said, ‚ÄúHey, say hi to Steve's work wife!‚Äù She went silent and just said, ‚ÄúOh, okay‚Ä¶‚Äù and hung up quickly.

The next day, I felt really uneasy because she hadn‚Äôt known about our silly office jokes and I didn‚Äôt want her thinking there was something serious. I got her number from our group WhatsApp (she sometimes sends birthday wishes there) and texted her:
 ‚ÄúHey, just wanted to say sorry if the ‚Äòwork wife‚Äô thing upset you yesterday. It‚Äôs just a silly nickname at work, no meaning beyond that.‚Äù
She didn‚Äôt reply, but later Steve was furious with me. He said I was out of line to text her directly and that I made things awkward at home. He told me to stay away from his personal life.
My friends are split. Some say I did the decent thing by clarifying and avoiding unnecessary suspicions. Others say I overstepped by contacting her privately without his consent.

A friend and I had just landed on a (very long) layover. We stopped at the bathroom and upon both of us finishing she just grabs her stuff and starts walking. My friend is not a well seasoned traveler (her first and only other flight was with me about a year ago). She didn‚Äôt say anything to me just started walking. I assumed she had a destination/ store she wanted to go to as we had stopped at this exact airport a week earlier on a layover and she had said in our hotel room that she wanted to purchase some things from this airport. We‚Äôre walking making u-turns, she stopped at a store but didn‚Äôt purchase anything and continues walking. I‚Äôm following her but losing ground as I had fractured my spine in 2015, injured my knee earlier this year, and have exercised induced bilateral compartment syndrome which was pretty bad because of all the walking we did on vacation. She finally stops at another store and by the time I catch up she‚Äôs handing her boarding pass over to the staff. I asked her what was going on and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to find our gate‚Äù. I told her we didn‚Äôt have a gate yet because we were 20 hours early for the flight. She said ‚Äúwell how was I supposed to know that?‚Äù I could tell she was upset (she‚Äôd been upset since we boarded the first flight for reasons unknown to me) so I didn‚Äôt respond she grabbed her boarding pass back from the staff and began walking again. Finally we end up at a Starbucks she orders a drink and sits down. At this point we‚Äôd been walking aimlessly around the airport for 2 hours, I didn‚Äôt want coffee at 10p so I walked down to the information desk to ask where there rest areas were so we could shower, charge our devices, and sleep. 5-10 minutes goes by and my friend texts me ‚Äúwhere are you?‚Äù I responded with ‚Äútrying to find a place for us to sleep‚Äù and she got upset saying I left her in a foreign country and that was unsafe; the info desk was around the corner. She‚Äôs also upset because while we were walking around I didn‚Äôt stop her and ask her where she was headed, or tell her that we didn‚Äôt have a gate (didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what she was looking for. And there‚Äôs no gate printed on the boarding pass. So like were you just gonna guess at what gate you were looking for? I‚Äôm confused on that whole thing). She then says ‚Äúim not a traveler I‚Äôve been following you this whole time‚Äù so I asked why she decided to lead when we left the bathroom if she had no clue what was going on and why she didn‚Äôt ask me any questions. She said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt lead us; I lead myself because I had no answers‚Äù I again stated she didn‚Äôt ask and that I was standing right next to her. She said ‚ÄúI asked employees‚Äù then got upset and said in all caps ‚ÄúSTOP TALKING TO ME DAMN‚Äù

I've been working on an app called WhatsKeepr2 that solves a problem many of us face when moving from Android - what do you do with your WhatsApp chats if you did not import them during the initial setup?

[Download Whatskeepr2](https://apps.apple.com/be/app/whatskeepr2/id6747646112) for 3.99$ once, to get the full app forever and its updates

[Chat Example](https://preview.redd.it/s08vvn4ljdef1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=cda5eb5aa5b423947055d440812e75e18f35054a)

**What is WhatsKeepr2?**

WhatsKeepr2 is a dedicated viewer for WhatsApp chat exports. When you export a chat from WhatsApp (that .txt file with a bunch of media files), WhatsKeepr2 lets you import and view it with a similar familiar chat interface.



**Key Features:**

üì± **Full Media Support** \- View images, play videos, listen to voice messages, and open documents just like in WhatsApp

üîç **Search & Organization** \- Search through messages, star important ones, and organize multiple imported chats

üéµ **Voice Message Player** \- Built-in player for voice notes with waveform visualization

üåç **Multi-language** \- Supports 12 languages: üá©üá™ German, üá¨üáß English, üá™üá∏ Spanish, üá´üá∑ French, üáÆüáπ Italian,  üáØüáµ Japanese, üá≥üá± Dutch, üáµüá± Polish, üáµüáπ Portuguese, üá∑üá∫ Russian, üáπüá∑ Turkish, üá®üá≥ Chinese Simplified

üé® **Customization** \- Change chat backgrounds and appearance to your liking

üìç **All Message Types** \- Handles text, media, documents, contacts, locations, and even stickers



**Why I Built This:**

While swapping from Android to iPhone I did not import WhatsApp chat. Many applications are available that promise to do the job but I considered them to be too expensive. 

I wanted to keep important WhatsApp conversations accessible without needing WhatsApp installed. Whether it's cherished conversations with loved ones, important business chats, or just memories you want to preserve, WhatsKeepr2 gives these exports a proper home on your device.

Therefore now you can keep exporting the same chats from iPhone adding the latest messages and media to the ones you already have imported in WhatsKeepr2.



¬†**Technical Highlights:**

\- Native iOS app built with Swift  
\- Efficient handling of large chat files  
\- Background processing for thumbnails  


¬†The app is particularly useful for:  
\- Archiving conversations before deleting WhatsApp  
\- Keeping important chats for reference  
\- Viewing old conversations from archived exports  
\- Managing multiple chat histories

1m67d91,https://www.reddit.com/r/westbengal/comments/1m67d91/why_bengal_is_lagging_behind_got_banned_from/,Why Bengal is lagging behind ‚Äî Got Banned from Kolkata community for sharp criticism,"Got banned recently from a Kolkata Reddit group for calling out something a lot of us know deep down but never say publicly. All I did was criticize how Bengalis, especially the educated ones, vote and think politically. I didn‚Äôt abuse anyone. Didn‚Äôt name any party. Just called out the rot. And I was banned. Just like that. Because apparently even that‚Äôs too much to handle.

The group behaved as if it was party-affiliated. Couldn‚Äôt take a simple political opinion. It hit me harder than I expected ‚Äî not because I was banned, but because it proved my point. That the crisis in Bengal is not the fault of politicians. It‚Äôs the mindset of the voters. Especially the so-called educated class.

Let‚Äôs be real. Bengal spent 34 years under a regime that destroyed industries and freedom of thought. And the next 15 years have been just another version of the same thing. You changed the logo, not the machinery. You replaced slogans with posters, leaders with idols, but the results are the same.

You‚Äôd think after decades of stagnation, joblessness, youth leaving, and a crumbling system ‚Äî people would wake up. But no. The same people who can quote Marx and Tagore over coffee are the ones who freeze when it‚Äôs time to question what‚Äôs happening in their own backyard. You talk about Palestine and caste and capitalism but go completely blank when asked about what‚Äôs happening in Ballygunge or Barasat.

The Bengali voter has turned selective. Hypersensitive. Defensive. They‚Äôll quote freedom of speech till it makes them uncomfortable. After that it‚Äôs ban. Report. Cancel. Silence. They don‚Äôt want debate. They want echo chambers. Polished and protected.

And that‚Äôs the core of the problem. You can‚Äôt blame politicians forever. They are elected. Re-elected. Backed by the same people who complain over WhatsApp but vanish on polling day or vote the same way their parents did out of tradition or fear or some twisted sense of cultural superiority.

The truth is most of the smart, ambitious people I know from Bengal don‚Äôt live in Bengal anymore. Left for Delhi. Mumbai. Bangalore. Abroad. Because this place doesn‚Äôt let them grow. Doesn‚Äôt want them to. And yet we pretend like we‚Äôre this beacon of intellectualism. This enlightened state. What a joke.

No real jobs. No startup ecosystem. No innovation hub. Public universities choking. Healthcare in survival mode. Roads that flood every monsoon. A city stuck in nostalgia and noise.

And what do we do about it Nothing. Just keep voting the same way. Keep defending the same failures. Keep shooting the messenger. The state has turned into a comfort zone for decay.

So yeah. I got banned. And honestly it made things clearer. If you get shut down just for saying the voter needs to take responsibility then maybe the problem isn‚Äôt political at all. Maybe it‚Äôs psychological.

Bengal isn‚Äôt just lagging behind. It‚Äôs choosing to. Every single day.",7,1753168104.0,westbengal,3,0.67,False

Everything was perfect ‚Äî the beaches, the waterfalls, the food trucks. But there was one thing I‚Äôd really been looking forward to: watching the sunrise from the summit of HaleakalƒÅ.

I kept hearing how surreal it is ‚Äî the sky slowly breaking into color above the clouds, standing there 10,000 feet up, wrapped in a blanket, sipping coffee like you‚Äôre on another planet. I thought, ‚ÄúThis will be the highlight of the trip.‚Äù

But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt know you needed a **reservation**.  
Not just any reservation‚Ä¶ a reservation that people grab **2 months in advance**.

So, picture me at 4 PM the day before, sitting on my hotel bed, casually Googling ‚ÄúHaleakalƒÅ sunrise access‚Äù only to get hit with the dreaded line:

>

I tried everything. Checked again at midnight. Woke up early hoping for a cancellation. Even drove part of the way up just to see if we could somehow slip through (spoiler: we couldn‚Äôt).

Eventually, I had to head back ‚Äî no sunrise, no summit, just a hard lesson in ‚Äúplan ahead.‚Äù üòÖ

So now I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî has anyone **actually** managed to snag a HaleakalƒÅ sunrise reservation just a day or two before? Is there a secret trick I missed? Some golden hour when last-minute spots open up?

Would love to hear if anyone‚Äôs had better luck‚Ä¶ or if I‚Äôm just part of the ‚ÄúI came all the way to Maui and missed HaleakalƒÅ‚Äù club. üåÑ",2,1753167813.0,VisitingHawaii,2,0.75,False

Markets wishing they were this spicy. Bitcoin and ETH? Taking naps. Solana? On another coffee break. Meanwhile, CRO just clocked $0.122 like it‚Äôs collecting badges at a carnival and the 2.71 prophecy is now trending on the blockchain and possibly at your grandma‚Äôs book club.

üìà Daily Vibes: CRO Refuses to Chill
Current price: $0.122, up from the weekend siesta and loving the altitude.

Weekly range: $0.102 all the way to $0.128. Some call it volatility; I call it cardio for bags.

ATH? Still a whisper at $0.9611 from the glory days, but now that ETF memes and Trump soundbites are fueling momentum, who needs sleep anyway?

üì∞ Headlines You Can't Make Up
ETF allocation: Still clutching that 5% like it‚Äôs sponsored by diamond hands. Sorry XRP, you‚Äôre on 2%‚Äîmaybe try LinkedIn?

Volume: $37 million traded today. That isn‚Äôt retail, that‚Äôs whales doing the salsa.

Tech talk: zkEVM live, trading smoother than MetaMask after a fresh browser install. Even MetaMask wants in on this drip.

Meme energy: ‚ÄúWhen CRO hits $2.71, Kris will buy an actual moon, declare it a validator node, and Satoshi will host a TED Talk.‚Äù If your group chat hasn‚Äôt posted this, check if they‚Äôre bots.

üòÇ CRO vs. The Usual Suspects
CRO: Up, awake, and out-partying everything with an acronym.

BTC: Checks its phone, goes back to bed.

ETH: Celebrates 2% moves like it discovered fire.

SOL: Online today, maybe. Try again tomorrow.

XRP: Still flexing courtroom muscles. Only thing pumping is the legal bill.

üèÜ Why CRO Is Printing All The Memes (and Gains)
ETF fuel: Moon not included‚ÄîBYO asteroid.

Tech: zkEVM, DeFi, and more user-friendly than a puppy at a dog caf√©.

Community: Posts memes faster than the chart can update. Bears muted on sight.

üéâ Final Message From the Intergalactic HODLers
You can try to read charts or trust price predictions. Meanwhile, CRO‚Äôs writing its own prophecy in real time and still handing out weekly green like it‚Äôs Halloween.

Moon WiFi password? ""ValidatorNode2.71"" ‚Äî no 2FA required, just pure belief.

I met 2 women this weekend off Hinge.

1st was really cool, pretty, and nice and we went for a **walk for 2 hours** and had a lot of mutual interests. BUT there just wasn't a spark. And we hugged at the end and I just don't think we'll date. We're in similar circles, but at the end of the day she's just another person and we didn't have butterflies. She'd be a good friend or coworker. So can't force it.

2nd wasn't as fun. We have a similar background and she's nice, but she was shy and quiet. It was a struggle to keep the convo going. BUT **we hung out for 5 hours.** We met at a coffee shop and then there were some craft stores and shops and we just went to them all. We both didn't really have any other plans and I didn't know how I can just end a date and abandon her. At one point we had some downtime and sat on a bench and there was a lull in the convo, so I went to kiss her and she reciprocated. And then we walked around a little more and made out again. And then she was going to Uber home, but it was expensive, so I offered to drive her (it was really on my way), and we made out as I dropped her off.",0,1753167576.0,dating_advice,7,0.38,False

But the other day he asked me whether there would be a new Mario game for the Switch 2 and it dawned on me that he's getting close to the age where he's going to be discussing leaks and rumours with his little playground pals and if I don't get my arse in gear, he's going to be the only one without an uncle who works at Nintendo.

1. **Road to Hana** ‚Äì A breathtaking coastal drive filled with waterfalls, black sand beaches (don‚Äôt skip Waianapanapa State Park!), lush rainforests, and banana bread stands that are *chef‚Äôs kiss*. Pro tip: start early and don‚Äôt rush ‚Äî it's about the journey, not just the destination.
2. **HaleakalƒÅ National Park (Sunrise or Sunset)** ‚Äì Watching the sun rise above the clouds at 10,000 ft is a spiritual experience. Make reservations in advance ‚Äî it's worth waking up at 3 AM for!
3. **NƒÅ Pali Coast (via boat from Maui or flight)** ‚Äì Technically part of Kauai, but scenic tours from Maui give you jaw-dropping views. If you can't make it to Kauai, Maui‚Äôs own **Molokini Crater** snorkeling trip is unreal too.
4. ** ªƒ™ao Valley State Monument** ‚Äì A peaceful, lush valley with dramatic scenery and cultural history. It's a short and easy stop near Wailuku.
5. **Lahaina Town (if accessible)** ‚Äì This historic town was full of charm and art. (Check local updates as it's been affected by recent events.)
6. **Kaanapali Beach & Whalers Village** ‚Äì Great for swimming, snorkeling, and beach walks. The sunset here is postcard-perfect.
7. **Makena Beach (Big Beach)** ‚Äì Wide, uncrowded, and stunning. Just be cautious ‚Äî the waves are powerful.
8. **Upcountry Maui** ‚Äì Visit lavender farms, local dairies, and sip coffee while overlooking the ocean from higher elevations. So serene.
9. **Wailua Falls & Twin Falls** ‚Äì For easy-access waterfalls. Pack your swimsuit!
10. **Local Food Trucks & Farmers Markets** ‚Äì You *have to* try fresh poke, shaved ice, and tropical fruit. Kihei and Kahului have amazing hidden gems.",1,1753167041.0,MauiVisitors,1,0.56,False

Tip: Go live quickly with 80% polish. Real users will tell you what's important.

**2. Too much information on the homepage**

Founders want to tell their whole story, but visitors usually just want to know: who are you?

Who are you? What can you do for me? How can I contact you?

Tip: Your hero section should answer all three questions in 10 seconds.

**3. Forget mobile users**

Beautifully designed desktop website that fails on a mobile device = dead in the water.

Tip: Mobile first. Test on real phones, not just responsive previews.

**4. Stuck in Domain/Server/CDN Hell**

Many non-technical founders are overwhelmed when trying to launch a website end-to-end.

Suggestion: use an all-in-one tool or work with someone who can streamline the process.

**5. Ignoring Search Engine Optimization Basics**

No title, no meta description, no alt text ...... no one will be able to find the site.

Tip: Even basic settings (titles, meta descriptions, sitemaps, search consoles) will help a lot.

**Bonus: Free Pre-Launch Website Checklist**

Over time, I've created a website launch checklist to help clients go live smoothly. It includes

* Mobile testing
* Core SEO steps
* Page speed checks
* CTA placement
* Domain + CDN + SSL setup

I‚Äôve also started a small build-for-you service based on all these lessons, focused on helping early-stage startups and solo founders get online fast and clean.

He came to my job because our companies cooperated from time to time. He visited like once a month or something. He always looked at me, stared at me. Even asked my boss about my relationship status. Sometimes he came up to me for a chat. I knew he was interested, however, I was in a relationship at a time. My partner died one year ago from addiction and I have been single since.

So this guy stopped visiting us, and I randomly just thought about him like 3 weeks ago.  
I got his number, and called him to ask about something credit score related since he works in finance industry.  
We chatted, he asked about my love life, I told him I'm single since my partner died, he told me he is getting divorced, but spending time with his son (12 years old) and that he will be in my town so we can meet.

It was a light, sweet conversation, obviously there was some sort of attraction on both ends, he seemed kinda shy.

I called him last Monday around 8 PM to ask about his weekend, he called me on Tuesday, we chatted again, about his work, his plans with his son. He told me to go and get a grab a coffee with just the two of us on Sunday(yesterday) since I mentioned I have a birthday. I told him that of course, I want to meet him, I'm open. He told me he wants to see me too.

He told me he has to go because he has a meeting at work. Then he texted me saying that he ""got shy"" and that he got nervous. I told him it's ok. He asked me if I'm seeing anyone recently, because he doesn't want to be inappriopriate. I told him I'm single, that I want to get to know him better.

On the same day, he calls me around 8 PM, he's outside of some restaurant with the coworkers on the lunch. We talk for 1 hour. He says he is ""crazy over me"", that he finds me very attractive, that he was always asking my boss about me, asked for my number. He told me if I'm open to travel with him for 3 days somewhere with my dog?(I have a sweet shihtzu) I say of course I would love that. He then proceeds to tell me ""Do we have to wait til Sunday? I have a hotel booked til Thursday,but I can leave earlier."" I told him that we can meet earlier of course. He told me we can meet tommorow (Wednesday), that he will stay in a hotel, we will go to a dinner.

The conversation went very smooth and we really had a good vibe with each other. We never had a chance to talk for so long, or get to know each other better, so I thought its a good opportunity. He also stated that he thinks about me. He brought up some details from the past - he told me which jeans I wore when he visited our office, or which shoes I wore. Also he told me I once got into some black car and drove off and that he drove behind me but he couldn't find me. (I don't remember that, I didn't know about that).Those little details seemed cute to me. It was like he still remembered. Like those moments from few years ago when we looked at each other were still alive. Illusion, but alive, maybe. Also he texted to me about his age, about the fact that he's not looking for ""fun"" to make this clear, when we talked he spoke about not going for prostitutes or sidechicks, that he is profesional at work considering his work status and stuff.

This conversation took place on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I texted him to confirm the meeting. The message was marked as green, no iMessage sent. I thought he is in a train and out of signal.  
The phone was ""out of signal"" for the whole day. I think this phone number is his private, from what I know. I was surprised.

Thursday, phone out of signal again.

Friday, out of signal. I call him from different number and he picks up after some time. Tells me he has a ""huge accident in his house and that he will call me later, also asks if we can meet'. Doesn't call me again.

Saturday. He calls me by mistake (on my second number, he didn't save it) saying that he is ""standing under number 20"" (I think he meant the door number or apartment number) I say which 20??? what???? and he tells me - Oh my god, I'm sorry.

Hangs up. His phone is out of signal/ out of reach for majority of the days. Sometimes he turns the phone on again so there is a signal but for short period of time.

Sunday. Phone was turned off for the whole day.

I know that none of you knows WHY he's doing what he's doing. But he seemed genuinely interested in me. He really seemed honest and shy about conversation and stuff.

Also, I think thats the big factor in understanding the story - he once visited our company (3 years ago) while being ...under some sort of substance to say at least. Also I found his tiktok account (no videos) and a lot of accounts about drug recovery are being followed by him.

I don't know if he's clean. I know nothing about it. We didn't talk about it. This might be his past but I just think it's worth mentioning. He also told me he is attending therapy because he used to have depression due to divorce.

I know y'all will say to stay away from him, but I genuinely don't know why is he ghosting me like this.  
I think the reasons might be:  
\- he is on a bender and doesn't know what's going on  
\- he knows he is an addict and ""doesnt want to hurt me""  
\- or he is clean from any substances and the reasons is unknown to me still  
Also when I told him I asked someone for his number, he told me that he was happy to give his number to this person to give it to me, and even if I didnt call him, he would ask for mine.

I had birthday yesterday and I wasnt even present or happy with my family because this situation made me feel so sad. I was so hopeful that we will spend time together.

I consider that he might be having a hard time right now. And it was weird, that he picked up the phone after ghosting and quickly said ""I have huge accident, can we meet? I will call back"". I don't know what is he going through right now. But we talked around 6pm and next day around 11AM the phone was already turned off. Why? he knew I was interested. He told me he's happy that I'm so open for communication, that we can talk about a lot.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he told me he used to fantasize about me and when he told me that, he said he feels relieved. He asked me ""if he ever was at his therapist, could he call me so I can confirm he said that to me"" so his therapist should know that he..overcame his fears I guess? And be proud of him? Im not judgmental and Im a very open person and I wanted him to open up so I took it lightly but now Im thinking he might be embarassed that he told me those things? That's why he's ghosting me?

Also when we spoke he was surprised that I am single, since he said that ""a woman like me for sure has many many men around me"" which isn't true since I don't have many encounters with men/ I don't text with anyone and I am not on dating apps. He asked if I am that picky about men? I said no, I was just waiting or the right one. 

TLDR; I (25F) spoke to a guy (39M) and now he's ghosting me.",2,1753166773.0,venting,2,1.0,False

1m66zt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/truecreppy/comments/1m66zt2/this_women/,This women,"I used to work the night shift at our town‚Äôs old public library.
Nothing glamorous‚Äîjust me, the shelves, and the occasional spilled coffee in the reading corner. It closed at 9 p.m., and I was usually the last one there.

I had my routine: lock the front doors, take out the trash, tidy up the shelves, maybe wipe down a table or two. It was always quiet. Sometimes it was even kind of peaceful.
But not that night.

That night started out just like the rest.
The last person walked out right on time. I locked the doors behind them, flipped the sign to ‚ÄúCLOSED,‚Äù shut off most of the lights‚Äîjust kept a few on in the main aisles. I started moving through my checklist like always.

I was halfway through the aisles when I heard something‚Äîa thump.
I turned around. No one was there.
But on the floor, right in the middle of the aisle I‚Äôd just walked past, was a copy of Little Women. Open. Facedown.

I bent down to pick it up, thinking maybe I missed someone during lockup.
I called out, kind of half-joking:
‚ÄúExcuse me? The library‚Äôs closed.‚Äù

Nothing.

So I kept going, brushing it off. Could‚Äôve been anything, right? Maybe it slipped from a shelf. But then I heard more sounds‚Äîsoft thuds, paper rustling‚Ä¶ and then something else.

A growl.

Low. Deep. Animalistic.
It came from the children‚Äôs section.

I froze.
It wasn‚Äôt a sound a person should make.

I moved toward it slowly. Every step felt wrong. Like my body was yelling at me to just go. But I looked anyway.
I peeked down one of the aisles‚Äî

And there she was.

A woman.
Barefoot. Wearing a torn, dirty nightgown. Her skin looked almost gray under the dim lights. Hair hanging in wild, matted tangles. And her eyes‚Äî
God, her eyes were all wrong. Huge, dark, like pits. Vacant.

She was hunched over, snarling like some kind of feral creature, throwing books off the shelves like she was in a trance.

My voice caught in my throat. I barely managed to whisper,
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam‚Ä¶?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt even look at me. Just let out this horrible guttural sound and threw a hardcover across the aisle.

That‚Äôs when I backed up and ran.

I made it to the back office, locked the door, shoved a filing cabinet in front of it. My hands were shaking as I called 911. I tried to stay calm. Tried to explain.

But then‚Ä¶ she found me.

She slammed into the glass window of the office door.
And started screaming.

Her face was right there‚Äîpressed up against the glass. Her eyes were huge, soulless, wrong. She was foaming at the mouth, shouting gibberish, clawing at the window like she wanted to rip through it.

The way she looked at me‚Äî
It wasn‚Äôt human.

It was like she wasn‚Äôt even in her body anymore.

I don‚Äôt know how long I waited. It felt like forever.
But eventually, the cops and paramedics showed up. I heard the yelling, the crashing furniture, her screaming like an animal being dragged away.

They had to strap her down to get her out. She was still thrashing.
One of the paramedics mumbled something about drugs. Maybe hallucinogens. But no one ever told me exactly what she was on‚Äîor if she was on anything at all.

They just‚Ä¶ took her away. And that was that.

I took a few days off after that. Told my boss I wouldn‚Äôt stay past closing anymore.
And I haven‚Äôt. Not once.

But sometimes‚Äî
Even now‚Äî
When the house is too quiet, or I walk by a dark aisle at the store‚Ä¶
I swear I can still hear it.

The sound of a book falling.
The low growl.
And that face‚Äî
Pressed against the glass.

Some stories stay on the page.
Some‚Ä¶ you live through.
And some?

They don‚Äôt let go.

I recently redesigned my living space and discovered that matching sets can sometimes make a room feel like a furniture showroom. The key is to find pieces that complement each other without being identical. Think of it like putting together an outfit - not everything needs to match perfectly to look good together.

When mixing coffee tables and end tables, I focus on these elements:

Materials: You can mix wood with metal, glass with stone, or even incorporate multiple wood tones. Just ensure there's at least one common element tying them together.

Style: While browsing through different coffee tables (check out some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables), I've found that mixing modern and traditional pieces can work surprisingly well. The trick is maintaining balance - if your coffee table is heavy and rustic, consider lighter, more refined end tables.

Color Scheme: This is crucial. Your tables don't need to be the same color, but they should exist within the same color family or complement your room's overall palette.

Scale: Your coffee table should be the anchor piece. End tables can be different heights and sizes, but they shouldn't overwhelm your coffee table.

I recently helped a friend choose her living room furniture, and we found some amazing coffee tables that worked perfectly with her existing end tables. If you're looking for inspiration, check out these options: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Some practical tips I've learned:

- Use similar hardware (handles, legs, or metal accents) to create cohesion
- Consider the room's traffic flow when mixing different shapes
- Don't be afraid to mix geometric and curved lines
- Think about functionality - storage needs, surface area, etc.

The most important thing I've learned is that there aren't really any strict rules. If you love how it looks and it functions well in your space, that's what matters. Trust your instincts and don't feel pressured to buy matching sets just because that's what you see in stores.

Remember, your living room should reflect your personal style. By mixing and matching thoughtfully, you can create a space that feels both curated and comfortable.",1,1753166362.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1m66vx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1m66vx2/how_strong_step_1_prep_helped_me_score_277_on/,How Strong Step 1 Prep Helped Me Score 277 on Step 2 (Non-US IMG Write-Up),"Hi everyone,

I initially planned to share this on the Step 2 subreddit, but I realized it might be more helpful for those still preparing for Step 1. After all, we all eventually take Step 2 and in most cases, it's the score that truly matters.

I‚Äôm a non-US IMG, and my Step 2 journey really began with my Step 1 preparation. Looking back, the way you prepare for Step 1 lays the foundation for how well you‚Äôll do on Step 2. I wasn‚Äôt a top student, and I couldn‚Äôt manage more than 6‚Äì8 hours of study a day, often less. But I was consistent. I gave myself time (about a year of semi dedicated study) and focused on using the **right resources with the right mindset**.

# Step 1 Preparation:

I used a mix of resources selectively and intentionally:

* **Sketchy**¬†‚Äì excellent for Microbiology and Pharmacology
* **Pixorize**¬†‚Äì made Biochemistry easy
* **Bootcamp**¬†‚Äì underrated, but exceptionally well made videos
* **USMLE-Rx**¬†‚Äì short and high yield; don‚Äôt skip the¬†*lymphatic drainage*¬†video
* **Pathoma**¬†‚Äì good for one watch through
* **Boards and Beyond**¬†‚Äì honestly, I found it boring
* **UWORLD & AMBOSS**¬†‚Äì I didn‚Äôt use them for Step 1, but they‚Äôre highly recommended
* **Anki**¬†‚Äì I unsuspended all Step 1 cards from AnKing/AnkiHub and brute-forced my way through

My approach was raw: I didn‚Äôt wait to learn concepts first. I started doing Anki blindly, and only when something confused me did I refer to videos or explanations. Only rarely, I would learn concepts before doing the associated cards. In hindsight, that was *inefficient but effective*. I don‚Äôt recommend doing it this way. Instead,¬†**learn the resource first, then use Anki to reinforce**.

**Don‚Äôt try to do all 30k+ Step 1 cards.** It‚Äôs overkill. Use QIDs from UWORLD/AMBOSS to unsuspend relevant cards. Many decks are redundant; focus on one resource and selectively build your deck around it.

I ended up doing well in Step 1 (passed in November 2024) and felt well prepared. In fact, I skipped UWORLD and AMBOSS because I was scoring 85%+ on the few blocks I attempted and honestly got bored. I knew I‚Äôd pass and that was enough for me at the time.

# Transition to Step 2: 

I took a two-month break after Step 1 and then started preparing for Step 2. But here‚Äôs an important point. During my Step 1 prep, I had already¬†*unsuspended Step 2 specific Anki cards*. So, by the time I finished Step 1, I was pretty comfortable with a lot of Step 2 content.

At that point, I felt confident, probably too confident. I remember thinking I could easily score 260+ if I took Step 2 the next day. But now I realize that confidence was¬†**purely from doing Anki**, and Anki alone isn‚Äôt enough for Step 2. The questions are deeper, more layered, and require better integration and clinical reasoning.

So, for Step 2, I went all in with:

* **UWORLD**¬†‚Äì excellent clinical questions
* **AMBOSS**¬†‚Äì I liked this even more; many unique concepts showed up on exam day
* **Anki**¬†‚Äì I unsuspended cards linked to UWORLD/AMBOSS QIDs and made a lot of my own, especially from lecture notes, UWORLD tables, and charts

This approach helped solidify knowledge and focus on¬†*why*¬†an answer is correct ‚Äî not just what the fact is.

# NBME & QBank Scores

Here‚Äôs how I scored in the lead up to Step 2:

|Date|NBME Form|Score|
|:-|:-|:-|
|06/13/2025|CCSSA Form 14|271|
|06/12/2025|CCSSA Form 12|258|
|06/11/2025|CCSSA Form 11|266|
|06/10/2025|CCSSA Form 10|267|
|06/09/2025|CCSSA Form 15|265|

* **UWORLD (1st pass)**: 86%
* **AMBOSS (1st pass)**: 82%
* **Free 120 (Sept 2024)**: 88%
* **AMBOSS Predicted Score**: 265 (Range: 255‚Äì275)

# Test Day Disaster (Almost)

On test day, I made a big mistake. I took a huge coffee-flavored protein bar¬†*and*¬†two spoonfuls of instant coffee right after Block 1. Within minutes, I was palpitating. I had a pounding headache through the next blocks. Paracetamol didn‚Äôt help. After Block 5, I took ibuprofen, which¬†*finally*¬†gave me some relief by Block 6.

Could I have scored a bit higher without the caffeine meltdown? Maybe. But I‚Äôm¬†**thrilled with my score: 277**¬†(July 2025).

# Final Thoughts

* Your¬†**Step 1 preparation is your Step 2 head-start**
* Use¬†**resources wisely**, and don‚Äôt burn yourself out trying to do everything
* **Anki is powerful**, but not sufficient on its own 
* Use QBanks thoughtfully
* Be¬†**strategic**¬†with your time and material; depth matters more than volume
* **Don't experiment on test day!**¬†Stick to what your body knows

You‚Äôve got this.

**If you‚Äôre preparing for Step 1, you‚Äôre already laying the groundwork for Step 2. Keep going.**

Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you have questions!",3,1753166270.0,step1,2,0.67,False
1m66vo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m66vo2/the_glistening/,The glistening,"Omnivita didn‚Äôt start the end of the world.
It just made it scalable.

The company‚Äôs breakthrough came quietly: a suite of micro-siphons capable of extracting human sebum‚Äîbody oil‚Äîfrom living donors without pain, blood, or danger. No needles. No side effects. Just a warm chair, a good podcast, and forty minutes of light suction. Think plasma donation, but greasier.

They called the product HumaneSlick‚Ñ¢, a sustainable fat replacement for animal feed. Cheaper than slaughter. Richer than soy. A single kilo could replace dozens of pounds of factory-farmed tallow.

You didn‚Äôt suffer. You just‚Ä¶ sweated for money.

People loved it.

‚ÄúI secrete, therefore I serve,‚Äù became a slogan.
‚ÄúFats of the people, by the people, for the planet.‚Äù That one stuck.

It took off‚Äîespecially with urban vegans, gig workers, and early retirees. Extraction lounges opened in strip malls and yoga studios. One pod visit paid for groceries. Two covered rent in Tulsa. A full-body, full-day session? That funded a week in Tulum and a week of bragging about it.

By year two, HumaneSlick‚Ñ¢ was being added to feed for everything from rescue dogs to dairy cows to zoo elephants. ‚ÄúSame kibble. Kinder planet.‚Äù Meat production became greener, leaner, and ever-so-slightly... sweet-smelling.

Then the dogs changed.


---

At first it was funny.
Pets licked their humans more. Puppies would nose at sweaty skin like it was bacon. Cats kneaded thighs and drooled.

But by the second quarter, things got teeth.

A woman in Miami woke up to her beagle chewing her shoulder. He wagged the whole time. A toddler in Oregon was found in the backyard with bite marks and a grinning goldendoodle standing guard. A man in Philly lost two fingers to his cockatoo.

No one died‚Äînot at first.
The animals didn‚Äôt want to kill. They just wanted‚Ä¶ more.

The CDC called it a behavioral anomaly. Omnivita released a statement emphasizing survivability. But ER admissions tripled. Veterinarians quit en masse. One zoo in Prague euthanized its entire carnivore wing after a lion developed a taste for its keeper and then tried to eat a school bus.

It got worse.

The virus, if it was one, didn't just make animals crave human oils. It made humans produce more of them. Profusely. Constantly. By month eighteen, people were sweating viscous, nutty-sweet fluid through their clothes. It soaked subway seats. It pooled in elevator corners. Office chairs had to be wiped down every hour.

The scent? Ambrosial.

Dogs chased joggers. Cats ambushed napping owners. A daycare in Alberta was overrun by raccoons. The children made it out. Mostly.

People stopped going out. Stopped hugging. Some smeared themselves in vinegar, others in synthetic pheromones. Nothing worked. The attacks weren‚Äôt fatal‚Äîbut they were escalating.


---

And then, just as the world hovered on the edge of bloodless collapse, a strange thing happened.

A drone survey team scanning for ‚Äúferal dog hives‚Äù over Northern California caught an anomaly: a stretch of land‚Äîmaybe 12 acres‚Äîwhere no one had been attacked.
No reported bites. No urgent care admissions. Not even a single missing jogger.

It was a commune. Unregistered, off-grid, and apparently thriving.

The residents‚Äîdozens of them‚Äîgrew their own food, wore handspun linen, and practiced some blend of open-air polyamory and direct democracy. They smelled like head shops and compost.

A CDC researcher named Carla Mings visited, wearing a bite-proof hazmat suit. She expected chaos.

She got a potluck. Hugs. A drum circle. Dozens of golden retrievers lying peacefully next to glistening, half-naked humans. One pit bull was playing a tambourine.

Carla took samples. Blood, sweat, hair.

The secret wasn‚Äôt genetic. It was olfactory.
The commune had, for decades, bathed in homemade soaps made with patchouli oil‚Äîa scent most modern noses found overwhelming. But to animals hyper-sensitized by HumaneSlick‚Ñ¢, it was nauseating. Repellent.
A perfect defense.

Omnivita patented it in six days.


---

The Patchouli Protocol‚Ñ¢ rolled out globally: a scented topical worn like a nicotine patch, or misted like perfume. Schools required it. Offices supplied it. Extraction pods added it automatically.

The attacks dropped overnight. Pets relaxed. Parks reopened. For the first time in two years, no one lost a toe.

And something deeper shifted.

By now, human oil production had become a fact of life. Everyone sweated constantly. It oozed into socks and gloves, soaked bedsheets, flavored morning coffee by accident. But where most saw discomfort, Omnivita saw opportunity.

They retooled their refining process. Human oils, it turned out, were a fantastic biofuel. Clean-burning. Carbon-negative. Infinitely renewable. The more people produced, the better the grid ran.

So they made sweating a job.

Sweat Sanctuaries replaced warehouses. Extraction lounges replaced call centers. No labor. No pollution. No injuries beyond the occasional yoga sprain.

Capitalism imploded in on itself‚Äîsoggy and satisfied.

The world kept spinning, now powered by people simply being people. Earning enough by lying in warm rooms, sweating into soft cloth, surrounded by purring cats and patchouli-scented breezes.

Somewhere outside what used to be Pittsburgh, a ten-year-old girl named Mina walked barefoot through a rewilded street. Her shirt was soaked with fragrant oil. Her dog, Jupiter, trotted beside her, alert but calm.

She looked up at her grandfather.

‚ÄúIs this what utopia smells like?‚Äù

He squinted into the sunset, wrinkling his nose.
‚ÄúSmells like hippies and feet.‚Äù

She smiled.
‚ÄúYeah. But no one's hungry anymore.‚Äù

He grunted. Jupiter licked his hand, gentle as a whisper.

Hey reddit, I don't really know how to write one of these, as I have never used reddit before, and I don't know what else to do about this situation but resort to reddit, so here it goes.

I, M(15), moved to a new town when I had just started school. I was nervous and my social anxiety made it worse, (undiagnosed at the time), but when I walked into class for the first time I saw her. Lets call her Hannah, I didn't know how to phrase it at the time but I liked Hannah, but over time (next 4 years), I noticed it was a crush. I became good friends with her, we laughed with each other, went to each other's birthday parties, and helped each other on school work, she helped me when I was beat up or bullied (happened a lot I am a proud nerd). I also had a friend at the time, let's call him Bob, well Bob also had feelings for Hannah and so he confided in me about it. I mustered up some confidence and told him to go for it and I think they'd be great for each other. He eventually went for it and it worked out. The next year, we returned from summer break and my mom told me to stick with Bob afterschool since we knew each other. Well I walked out and waited, a few minutes go by and I see Hannah walk out, I asked her where he was and she ignored me. I assumed she might've not heard me, so I asked again. This time she turned around with a stone cold monotone look, gave a quick shrug and walked away without saying a word. Bob walks out shortly after looking defeated. I asked him what happened and he said they got into a small fight (sorry, I forgot what the fight was about), I stopped after he told me he thought it was over between them, he stopped with me and I said ""what are you talking about bro, you need to apologize, you can't throw this away over a simple dispute"" he responded with a weak ""yeah, okay"", he did nothing I shoved him slightly, and when he looked I gestured to Hannah. After a silent argument between us happened, he rolled his eyes gave a 'I'm going to get you back for this' smile and ran up to her, they both apologized, hugged and by the time they were done I had caught up to which I threw out a ""splendid!"" remark. Over the course of the next 3-4 years I became their counselor, and it was great! They were in love and Bob appreciated the help and advice. That was until the wicked witch of the west known as Barbra stepped into Hannah's life and screwed with the relationship, she told Hannah that she was better than Bob and to drop deadbeats that, quote ""looked like me"" (granted at the time I wasn't the model of handsome, I was short and chunky) Hannah eventually gave into the need of social validation, and dropped Bob as a boyfriend, and me as a friend. The winter was a cold, long, and bitter one that year...

Moving on through the no contact years to 7th grade, Hannah was in my class but so was Barbra, oddly enough Hannah started to complement my work and tried to chime into my conversations. Barbra and I despised of each other, Barbra was eventually dropped as a friend, and Hannah was friendly to me, often talking to me and smiling. However things would change in 8th grade, she stopped being friendly to me, for the most part... My crush had redeveloped in 7th grade after her string of compliments, yet in 8th grade Hannah would dig herself a deeper hole in the realm of need of social validation by dating guys that lured her in with promises of a fulfilling relationship, but it was always toxic, they'd cheat on her and when she thought it was over, tried to move on, the dudes would beg for forgiveness and when she left them, they would call her a cheater. During group events though she would often stand next to me, but If I interacted with her at all, whether that be saying ""excuse me, real quick"", or ""Oh, Hello!"", or maybe ""Pardon me"", she would get stone cold and distant, she'd occasionally laugh at my jokes, but other than that nothing. I thought hope was lost for this idea of a crush but I still couldn't shake the idea of her out of my mind, eventually my town hosted a Christmas event, to help out for a local charity I spun a sign for it while dressed like a funny elf. Randomly a inflatable ginger bread man came up to me and started to play fight, essentially a mascot fight to raise attraction. At the time of the mascot fight I had no idea who was in the suit but they were helping me raise money for the charity. After it was over, my buddy walked up to me (also helping the charity), let's call him brad, said ""that was awesome, I didn't know you and Hannah planned the mascot fight. at that moment I saw her unzip the Gingerbread suit and get out of it, as one of her friends went back in, and almost immediately after they come running back and act like it's going to happen again before fake dragging the gingerbread man away, one of the people dragging her away was Hannah, and she was smiling and looking at me until her boyfriend walked up, purchased something from our charity to help and greeted me before walking back over to Hannah to which Hannah's face became excited and focused on him. It WAS her boyfriend after all, but I can't but help but think she participated with me all for nothing (she was not apart of the charity group), spring came and went, she acted flustered when I said hello to her but overall was still reserved towards me, It hurt but I get it, I was a lanky 5'8, with fluffy unkept hair, I wore silly T-shirts and I was a nerd. Hannah was a 5'7, long haired, deep brown eyed, beautiful model like girl that was on the school news team, cheerleading squad, soccer team outside of the school, and had a good reputation as a fun loving popular kid. I am awkward, and get flustered around her too. I also would be lying if I said I didn't have multiple panic attacks dude to these feelings! I want to be her rock, her shoulder to cry on, I want to be there for her, I want to protect her and above all else just talk to her again

Some nights I lay in bed with headphones on listening to 50's jazz music to try and distract my brain from thinking about her, but I just want us to talk and maybe just chill at a coffee shop and chat. I haven't told ANYONE about this situation and In a moment of desperation took to reddit. I've been listening to Smosh reddit stories and I think that might have something to do with this impulsive decision. I probably hold off on any updates until my family or friends learn about this crush or this post and I then have nothing to be afraid of. So until then I leave you with the question of, what should I do, and If I do anything how should I? PS - Sorry if I used the wrong Flair, this is my first reddit post ever...

1m66u13,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1m66u13/i_25f_spoke_to_a_guy_39m_and_now_he_has_his_phone/,I (25F) spoke to a guy (39M) and now he has his phone turned off for days.,"So there is this guy who I met like 4 years ago. He came to my job because our companies cooperated from time to time. He visited like once a month or something. He always looked at me, stared at me. Even asked my boss about my relationship status. Sometimes he came up to me for a chat. I knew he was interested, however, I was in a relationship at a time. My partner died one year ago from addiction and I have been single since.

So this guy stopped visiting us, and I randomly just thought about him like 3 weeks ago.  
I got his number, and called him to ask about something credit score related since he works in finance industry.  
We chatted, he asked about my love life, I told him I'm single since my partner died, he told me he is getting divorced, but spending time with his son (12 years old) and that he will be in my town so we can meet.

It was a light, sweet conversation, obviously there was some sort of attraction on both ends, he seemed kinda shy.

I called him last Monday around 8 PM to ask about his weekend, he called me on Tuesday, we chatted again, about his work, his plans with his son. He told me to go and get a grab a coffee with just the two of us on Sunday(yesterday) since I mentioned I have a birthday. I told him that of course, I want to meet him, I'm open. He told me he wants to see me too.

He told me he has to go because he has a meeting at work. Then he texted me saying that he ""got shy"" and that he got nervous. I told him it's ok. He asked me if I'm seeing anyone recently, because he doesn't want to be inappriopriate. I told him I'm single, that I want to get to know him better.

On the same day, he calls me around 8 PM, he's outside of some restaurant with the coworkers on the lunch. We talk for 1 hour. He says he is ""crazy over me"", that he finds me very attractive, that he was always asking my boss about me, asked for my number. He told me if I'm open to travel with him for 3 days somewhere with my dog?(I have a sweet shihtzu) I say of course I would love that. He then proceeds to tell me ""Do we have to wait til Sunday? I have a hotel booked til Thursday,but I can leave earlier."" I told him that we can meet earlier of course. He told me we can meet tommorow (Wednesday), that he will stay in a hotel, we will go to a dinner.

The conversation went very smooth and we really had a good vibe with each other. We never had a chance to talk for so long, or get to know each other better, so I thought its a good opportunity. He also stated that he thinks about me. He brought up some details from the past - he told me which jeans I wore when he visited our office, or which shoes I wore. Also he told me I once got into some black car and drove off and that he drove behind me but he couldn't find me. (I don't remember that, I didn't know about that).Those little details seemed cute to me. It was like he still remembered. Like those moments from few years ago when we looked at each other were still alive. Illusion, but alive, maybe. Also he texted to me about his age, about the fact that he's not looking for ""fun"" to make this clear, when we talked he spoke about not going for prostitutes or sidechicks, that he is profesional at work considering his work status and stuff.

This conversation took place on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I texted him to confirm the meeting. The message was marked as green, no iMessage sent. I thought he is in a train and out of signal.  
The phone was ""out of signal"" for the whole day. I think this phone number is his private, from what I know. I was surprised.

Thursday, phone out of signal again.

Friday, out of signal. I call him from different number and he picks up after some time. Tells me he has a ""huge accident in his house and that he will call me later, also asks if we can meet'. Doesn't call me again.

Saturday. He calls me by mistake (on my second number, he didn't save it) saying that he is ""standing under number 20"" (I think he meant the door number or apartment number) I say which 20??? what???? and he tells me - Oh my god, I'm sorry.

Hangs up. His phone is out of signal/ out of reach for majority of the days. Sometimes he turns the phone on again so there is a signal but for short period of time.

Sunday. Phone was turned off for the whole day.

I know that none of you knows WHY he's doing what he's doing. But he seemed genuinely interested in me. He really seemed honest and shy about conversation and stuff.

Also, I think thats the big factor in understanding the story - he once visited our company (3 years ago) while being ...under some sort of substance to say at least. Also I found his tiktok account (no videos) and a lot of accounts about drug recovery are being followed by him.

I don't know if he's clean. I know nothing about it. We didn't talk about it. This might be his past but I just think it's worth mentioning. He also told me he is attending therapy because he used to have depression due to divorce.

I know y'all will say to stay away from him, but I genuinely don't know why is he ghosting me like this.  
I think the reasons might be:  
\- he is on a bender and doesn't know what's going on  
\- he knows he is an addict and ""doesnt want to hurt me""  
\- or he is clean from any substances and the reasons is unknown to me still  
Also when I told him I asked someone for his number, he told me that he was happy to give his number to this person to give it to me, and even if I didnt call him, he would ask for mine.

I had birthday yesterday and I wasnt even present or happy with my family because this situation made me feel so sad. I was so hopeful that we will spend time together.

I consider that he might be having a hard time right now. And it was weird, that he picked up the phone after ghosting and quickly said ""I have huge accident, can we meet? I will call back"". I don't know what is he going through right now. But we talked around 6pm and next day around 11AM the phone was already turned off. Why? he knew I was interested. He told me he's happy that I'm so open for communication, that we can talk about a lot.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he told me he used to fantasize about me and when he told me that, he said he feels relieved. He asked me ""if he ever was at his therapist, could he call me so I can confirm he said that to me"" so his therapist should know that he..overcame his fears I guess? And be proud of him? Im not judgmental and Im a very open person and I wanted him to open up so I took it lightly but now Im thinking he might be embarassed that he told me those things? That's why he's ghosting me?

Also when we spoke he was surprised that I am single, since he said that ""a woman like me for sure has many many men around me"" which isn't true since I don't have many encounters with men/ I don't text with anyone and I am not on dating apps. He asked if I am that picky about men? I said no, I was just waiting or the right one. 

TLDR; I (25F) spoke to a guy (39M) and now he's ghosting me.",12,1753166071.0,confession,33,0.8,False

The guy at the table next to me got up to take a phone call and left his MacBook open.

Right after he stepped away, his friends leaned over and opened his WhatsApp. They started reading his chats out loud, laughing. Then they clicked into his Google Photos. It was funny for a second, but then it got kind of weird. You could tell he had no idea.

It made me stop and think about my own setup.

My Mac is almost always open with everything running. Slack, Gmail, my bank tab, saved passwords, photos. All one click away. 

I don‚Äôt always lock my full screen when I step away for a minute. Sometimes I‚Äôm in the middle of something, and logging back in messes things up. Stuff reloads or closes. It‚Äôs just annoying.

So a while back, I got this little app called AppCrypt (by a brand called Cisdem.) It's always running in my background and it lock all apps, just one password. I usually lock Slack, MS Teams, my email, and my browser. If someone tries to open a app I've locked, it asks for a password. If they get it wrong, it logs the capture a photo to record this failed attempt with laptop's camera.

It‚Äôs quiet, runs in the background, and I forget it‚Äôs even there most of the time. But seeing what happened today reminded me why I keep it on.

You never know who‚Äôs going to be near your screen. Even your friends might get curious.

Anyway, just wanted to put this out there. If you work in public, or even at home with others around, it‚Äôs worth thinking about.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Friends and fellow travellers,

[Yesterday I asked for sober highs](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/s/sKnyFkazjy), and wow you delivered. You guys inspire me so much! Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have time during the day to respond much, but I have read through them all, and here are some of them;

Reconnecting with family, securing a job, taking walks, love, hugs, friendships, waking up early and sitting at the porch with a coffee (ooh I like this one too!), dancing, swimming, emotional regulation (good point!) - and so much more. Boiled down to one word: LIFE. Isn‚Äôt it amazing? I think my new sober high is life.

In this vein, what are you thankful for? The first time I had this question, right here on the sub on the Thankful Thursday thread, I got mad. Nothing! Then I decided to find one thing, just in spite. Coffee. I was thankful for my coffee. Next week, my wool socks. Next week, my window. Now I‚Äôve learned to look for those little glimmers of joy and hope and beauty and kindness, and they are *everywhere* like stars in the sky. You just have to look.

After being a lurker for a long time, this is my first ever Reddit post for dating, and this is my most honest and vulnerable self. **FIRST** let me save your time by telling you **NOT** to read any further if physical attraction is your #1 priority or very important for you in a connection, hence my title. I am truly wanting to connect on a level that is beyond looks.

Still here then?

**Let‚Äôs**: watch movies, game (pc) and keep one another company for the remainder of this summer and if we are still vibing then lets take it into autumn. I'd love for us to travel for weekend getaways big or small in the future, experiencing new things and making memories together. Lets go to music festivals, lets try camping under an endless night sky. I want a man to be able to do everything and absolutely nothing with.

***A few things I love***: horror films, reading(fiction), art, autumn, loooong walks, gaming(solo & co-op), shoegaze, rainy days, fresh bedding, hugs, laughing, dancing, botanical gardens, coffee that *isn't* made by me, for some reason.

***Lets take things abit deeper about me***: Divorced. I have no children but I am open to starting a small closeknit family with the right man even if its just us and pets, to me that is also family. Currently I am a student so a lot of my time goes to that(40h/week). I do strength training and go to fitness classes 2x a week. I am a non-smoker & non-drinker (*I don't mind a celebratory champagne*). I speak/write English(native) & Danish(intermediate), so I am an immigrant here. I'm not on any social media platforms, I tend to keep in touch the old fashioned ways. I am embracing a more minimalistic and simple lifestyle. Generally and overall I am a quiet, calm and private person. I like charging up on my own (introvert) but with time I can do that with you still being around. I have deliberately *tried* to keep this short, so we have so much more to talk about.

I often see posts focusing on ***physical description,*** I'll add a few details: White with fair skin, brown eyes, medium length brown hair. 1.73m, 79kg(60 is my current goal), with a curvaceous fleshy body type. I have tattoos but have started the removal process (*don't mind that you have them*). I have prescription eye glasses. I'm not somebody that anybody looks twice at here in Scandinavia, but I am still presentable, womanly and love to smell good.

***You***: A decent, stable and kind man. 30-55 years old, give or take. You are single without serious attachments to the past (older children are fine). Has the time and emotion available to pursue a potential relationship and has the means that we can meet one another often enough when/if the time comes. Good looks are not the main thing you prioritize in a connection as stated in the beginning of my post. You are relocatable OR willing to and have the compacity to assist me with relocating in the future if things go that far between us. You are not overtly religious. You do not have a p\*rn-rotted mind. You don't care all that much for social media (the sharing aspect), like me. You are not non-chalant about your lady or your life.

***Reiteration***: I do **NOT** care about your height, your rizz, your race, your accent, your balding head, how much you can lift or if you are a noodle (but I hope you care for yourself in some way as I have started on a health journey myself and getting better each day, lets continue together!).  All that aside, your values, actions and character are what is **MOST** important. It certainly is what‚Äôs inside that counts for me.

***If you resonate with this*** and want to message, it would be so cool that you include a-bit about yourself since that'll kinda depend on if I will respond so that we can schedule a chemistry chat soon. I will be open to video calls for verification the more we talk and get to know one another ***<3***",3,1753165704.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.67,False

A redditor came to Ahmedabad. He is an engineering student.

I have planned a small meet on Sunday 11AM Near Ranip. We discussed regarding mentoring people to learn English and this will improve our skill of communication and will reduce our stage fear if we organise any event.

So I thought to update if anyone want to come for meet.

I am planning to meet with him first, then everyone should come.

Edit:
If we go for a small coffee or snacks, then I'm planning for a split bill max of 100-200

If anyone is not interested in food then they can leave

Thanks",2,1753165497.0,ahmedabad,4,1.0,False

Matt was introduced as a buddy of a buddy, and I could feel this sorta tension in the air when he walked in. I overheard one of my friends mentioning that he seemed ""kinda off,"" which was weird cuz he hadn't even said much yet.

Over the next few days, I kept bumping into Matt and noticed he was actually pretty cool‚Äîlike, super polite and always offering to help out. But even with all these good vibes he was throwing, some of my friends still seemed stuck on their first impression of him. It makes me wonder... why are first impressions so ""sticky""? üß†

I think it has a lot to do with cognitive bias. Our brains love shortcuts, and once that initial perception's formed, all future interactions kinda get filtered through that lens. And even when there's obvious evidence to the contrary, it can be hard to shake that first idea.

Has anyone else noticed this happening in their circles? Like, seeing someone get pegged by an impression they can't shake off? It's sorta fascinating to think about how these perceptions mold our social groups and interactions. ü§î",5,1753165492.0,SocialDynamics101,0,0.86,False

I'm not even sure why, but my brain decided to freeze up mid-conversation. üòÖ It's like I totally forgot how to be a functioning adult. I mean, we've been dating casually for a few months, but the moment he asked about 'us', I started rambling about how much I love iced coffee... geez. 

Honestly, I didn't expect it, and I'm not sure how to proceed. How do y'all handle these talks without making it super awkward? Any tips to make it less intense or maybe even slightly humorous? Would love to know if there's a smooth way to navigate this without sounding like I'm either desperate or too cool for a label. Also, is it normal to feel this level of awkwardness, or is it just me overthinking? üòÇ Help a girl out!",7,1753165305.0,FlirtFinesse,1,0.9,False
