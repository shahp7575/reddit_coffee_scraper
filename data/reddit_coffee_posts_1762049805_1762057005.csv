This issue has been an ongoing source of very unpleasant arugments between my bf and I -- AITA for not being able to find a solution with this big mess? My mental health is being damaged by all this and probably my bf's too :(

Despite him feeling angry, hurt and snubbed he continues to stays in the relationship. At the beginning of the year we had a terrible arugment brought on by the fact I mentioned I would be busy on the day he wanted to hang out because it was my mom's Birthday. He expressed how ridiculous it was he couldn't even be aloud to come over and bring her a Birthday Card or wish her a Happy Birthday. Then he said **""if your mom can't approve of us dating I don't see this going anywhere.""** 
That statement really hurt me to hear. 

Well we argued some more the following day, even made a seen at a coffee house! Then a few hours later we spoke over the phone after he calmed down and I told him point-blank **""If you cannot handle this please let me go... If you do not see a future with me please just let me go!""**

He paused and in a calm tone, he finally told me he loved me after we had been dating for a year at that point. This was not what I had expected to hear at all as he wanted to always take things super slow. After he said those three words, he explained that we just need to stop bringing up anything to do with my mom - that was the condition! 

I agreed and arguments about the topic stopped for a while until the end of this summer. What triggered this awful argument was that he wanted to invite me for an overnight trip. I told him there was no way I could do that while I live with my mother more over the fact she doesn't trust Or like my bf would just create a hellish time of arguments in my household. **Again I start hearing my bf say if your mom doesn't approve we can't have a future!""** I told him it isn't right to throw back an Issue in my face he agreed he would deal with --- little did I know there was a **condition** attached to this and if was that I was to **keep working** on my mother! 

My bf is basically expecting me to change my mom's mind. To him he feels I am not trying hard enough and that he should be able to at least be on speaking terms with her. 

Anyway, after all this stress I agreed to ask my mom about the overnight offer. 
I'm in my late 30s and I live with an old school prudish immigrant mother - so yes I understand it's embarrassing for me at my age to need her approval it's also the toxic dynamic we have because she sees me as her child not a grown women. In her words I have done nothing to show her I am and adult so she will treat me like her kid until I prove myself! Also, I **need** her approval or else hell breaks lose and we will argue hours none stop and severl times a week --- she is persistent when she is upset with me so I am stuck.

... 

My bf is also **""working on"" my mom by offering things to her such as help or food but she isn't budging!** This leaves my bf feeling snubbed and rejected -- why is he subjecting himself to this??


**From what he has explained to me he just wants her to be civil about things so he doesn't have to feel like he's sneaking around behind her back** --- I am open and honest with my mother I am with him though but still my bf feels it's not a good setup.

Some back story...

My bf and I are in our late 30s and I am renting a place with my mother while he had to move back in with an older parent. Because of how my mom feels she has said he can not come over to *our* place. When I challenge her that I am also on the lease and therefor have say she flips it that so does she and if she doesn't want someone she is uncomfortbale with in our home I need to respect that --- I don't know how to counter argue that? 

**It bothers me that my mom doesn't even want to have a sit down heart to heart chat with my bf so she can hear**~~~ **from his mouth** what are his intentions with her daugther. I explained to my mom that without doing that she doesn't know the full picture and therefor it's not fair for her to keep criticizing the two of us --- is this a fair point? **She claims she knows ""men like him""...** 

**It's important to my bf that while I live with my mother she be okay with us dating but that once I move out he wouldnt care as much.** I am making the changes to get my own place, but it will be a long process. My ""failure to launch"" has to do with co dependacey between my mom & I as well as my chronic health issues.

This makes me feel like he won't be able to fully commit to me because of this issue. We have been dating almost two years and while we are taking things slow I am slightly older than him and I don't like having my relationship with him potentially threatened by something I have little control over.

I also do NOT like that my mother continues to nag and criticise me for staying with him. **This treatment from her and my bf's disappointment has been slowing ""eating away"" at this relationship.**

I don't know what else to say to each of them. Boundaries between my mom and I are a struggle and I feel sad that my bf isn't able to have his need met. Should I just be the bigger person and end things with him? It all seems very unfair to everyone involved.

So, I've been messing around with AI tools for ages now – playing with image generation, trying to automate some boring tasks, you know the drill. It’s a fun hobby, keeps the brain ticking. But then I started thinking... why am I just doing this for kicks? Why not actually make some money from it?

Has anyone else felt that way?

The thought process went something like this:

*   **I’m already spending time learning this stuff.** Time is money, right?
*   **AI can seriously *boost* my productivity** or even *create* entire income streams. Think automation, content creation, design…the possibilities seem endless!
*   **Someone, somewhere, is already making bank off of this.** Why not me?

I've been digging around and exploring a few ideas, and let me tell you, some are kinda crazy but also...kinda genius?

Like, imagine:

*   **Automating social media content creation:** You feed your AI a prompt, and it spits out engaging posts, captions, and even hashtags. Set it and forget it!
*   **Creating custom AI-generated art for print-on-demand products:** Mugs, t-shirts, posters… slap on some unique AI art, and boom, passive income stream!
*   **Building a simple AI-powered tool to solve a specific problem:** Could be anything from a writing assistant to a personalized workout plan.

Sounds good in theory, right? But then, the dreaded ""how"" question pops up. That's where I've been struggling... How do I *actually* turn these ideas into something profitable? Where do I even begin?!

Then I stumbled across something… *cough cough* **Ready to start earning $1,000+ per month with automated reselling?

Try it now with my affiliate link and unlock your path to passive income! : https://whop.com/houseofprofits/houseofprofits?a=liveitupdeals** *cough cough* …Sorry, had something in my throat. Anyway! It got me thinking maybe jumping into something more concrete like automated reselling would give me the confidence and income to build even cooler AI stuff later.

So I'm genuinely considering taking the plunge and trying to turn this AI hobby into something that pays the bills (or at least covers the cost of my excessive coffee consumption 😂).

Anyone have any success stories they can share? Or maybe some cautionary tales to keep me grounded?

What are YOUR dream AI income streams? And what’s stopping you from pursuing them?

1om7y0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAKorean/comments/1om7y0m/is_it_the_courtesy_to_schedule_a_coffee_or_lunch/,Is it the courtesy to schedule a coffee or lunch right after 1 coffee just for the sake of asking and never respond? My parents told me this is the norm in Korea and people offer empty words and just expect no answer back after someone asked out of courtesy.,"My parents told me that koreans sometimes fake schedule coffee or lunch on purpose after 1 lunch gathering is over.


He literally does a skit in front of me :
 
A: good lunch.should we scheduled for another?
B: yeah absolutely. 

Parents explain: ""Understand that their offer is fake and you shouldn't expect them to return back to you. This is the norm here and people ask all the time out of courtesy like a script"" 

It actually happened to me many times 

For instance a Korean relative elder, (50s) towards the end of lunch, suddenly got excited about a good restaurant and literally scheduled a meet up at that spot. I never texted me back for years after. 

This also happened with People in their 20s. 

In the US, this is usually not acceptable because its rude. Any inconsistency especially if you don't show up is not OK. 

But I'm always told elders or adults are correct and I shouldn't ask questions just obey no matter what they do even if it's not understandable or polite in other countries. So I'm asking here for the first time honest advice:

Is it the norm courtesy to fake ask every time you depart to have another coffee or meal? 

Do I have to do this to appear courteous? If so, what's the other person's age limit for asking this? Do I do this if I'm older than that person? Or vice versa

What is Pixy AI?
Pixy is an AI app that generates functional app screens on the fly using Generative UI and vibecoded APIs. Simply describe what you need, and it creates the interface to make it happen.
Key Features:

Single-shot generation for most common use cases
Deep integrations with Spotify, Gmail, Calendar, and more through MCPs with OAuth
Unified control via chat/voice assistant that can access all your connected services
Persistent mini-apps that live in your main app and are always accessible

I'm trying to break down the walled nature of traditional apps and create a seamless experience where the system adapts to your needs in real-time.
Beta Access (iOS TestFlight)
I'm opening up beta access to a limited number of users who can push this beyond its limits and provide quick feedback.
Sign up for the waitlist here: 
[pixy](https://getpixy.ai)

I'll personally send out TestFlight links via email within a week.
A Reality Check:
This won't replace specialized apps anytime soon—those will always have an edge with humans in the loop refining every detail. Instead, think of Pixy as a general-purpose AI operating system: you specify your intent, and it generates the screens and functionality to achieve your goals.

I'm Aaron, 27, from Ohio.

I'm looking for a regular gaming buddy who also wants to become friends. I work from home most days and typically work 7-3 or 9-5 (depending on how I feel) Monday through Friday, and am always fully available on weekends. I tend to be more of a night owl, so I typically like to stay up late most days.

I play all kinds of games: Overwatch, Fortnite, Valorant, Marvel Rivals, and I also enjoy co-op games. I'm always down to try new games as well.

Other things I enjoy are cats, coffee, piano, making stuff, music, anime, tv shows, movies, and I'm down to talk about just about anything.

You can be from any timezone; I get on well with people from anywhere as long as we have time to hang out on a regular basis.

""Toxic"" because our relationship is great when its good and terrible when its bad. We have high highs when we feel like the chips are down then we still got each other in our corners. But lowest of lows when we overtaking the other person is having issues (emotionally unavailable). And we've discussed this before with her having anxiety and thinking people dont like all of a sudden for no reason. I told her sometimes I feel like I would do anything for you and leave at the drop of a hat to show up for you but you wouldnt do that for me. 

She said that she felt shitty about that and tried to make effort to show up for me. At the same time, this became a crutch because we got to know and live with eachother so closely that she definitely keeps me at arms lengths sometimes cuz she gets overwhelmed. Like we'll have a good day or two of being inseparable and then she'll want like a week break from talking. She has this thing where if there is ""nothing to talk about"" then she gets anxious like we cant fill out conversation with anything else and she hates silence. So unless there's gossip or something then its no good and ive become more and more involved in that scene with her by proxy. (Drama is a big thing for her, she loves it).

Here's the thing: She's popular and younger (by 4 years) and was single and gay. People are attracted to her personality and she's cool. And that electricity that you whip up from living in the eye of the storm like that was exactly me. We've drawn A LOT of parallels in our life too, but specifically this social status of hers gets in the way of us being true friends. When I was at this center of attention, it was bad for my health where no one would see, and I went through a big ego death to reflect on the harmful effects that the lime light had on me. 

Now you see, she is still there and doesnt intend on leaving it. And so 1v1 we're amazing friends because she's just a goofy silly girl and we're talking about all kinds of dumb things and getting coffees. But whenever there is literally a singe other person, she changes and puts that wall up to prop herself up. And sometimes at my expense. Like if there someone we're talking to and she's saying the sky is red and I say that its yellow, she'll say something snarky like ""you only think that because youre color blind"" as a way to invalidate me, even if its ""joking"" because it usually feels like im the punchline. And I usually just let her have it because even if it does get to me, im usually not interested in debating dumb shit like that.

Yes, I've checked her in front of people a couple times. She doesnt like that. And confronted me about doing it even tho I was just giving it back to her.

Anyway, my specific grievance is that she just called me while she's visiting a friend. And told me to come over. I said I just got done cooking dinner. And her friend who I've met only twice, made fun of me which I wasn't really comfortable with because I dont know her. She said that they wouldnt be drinking or anything and I said I really just got done making dinner, I cant leave it. And her friend said I sound old. So I said we'll yeah I am old? Im almost 30 and I dont really want to drive an hour over to the city. And then this friend said I was weird for that and that I was probably just eating something shitty. Now this hurt my feelings but im trying to respect my friend by not saying anything. And my friend says how old do you this girl is? And her friend says we'll, she does have a kid so that changes you...at this point im like, ok so you guys are just talking about me like im not here? And I just said honestly,  I've always been like this and you know this. I am a homebody, and thats never bothered you before. I hope you guys have a good night. And then hung up.

Why should I have to made fun of for literally living my life peacefully? I only get so many weekends to myself...I do get sad and lonely sometimes but other times I find myself happy to be in this little sanctuary thats all mine and Noone can bother me in it. So I dont know if I should be feeling as pressed as I am about this. It just feels like if I met this girl anywhere else, I dont think we wouldve grown to be as close of friends as we are now. And I've old her that before as well. It feels like she could only be friends with me because im the fatter, uglier, not cool, nice, straight friend that she can just run to when she wants something and to be validated.

Ive had enough of those friendships. Sometimes I feel like it's better to be left alone than to be made into a step stool for others just because they cant accept themselves.",1,1762055573.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

\-Must be at least somewhat affordable. Example: No more than $150 for 50 ml (1.7 oz) 

\-Must be a brand that sells and ships outside of US (lots of niche US brands I love but international shipping is difficult for them, this is important as I might be outside of US for a while)

Help,"Short backstory. Im in my early 30s, currently living and working in Hainan, China. The island is like Hawaii. I am an active guy, with several hobbies. I dont party or drink. I love sports and gym, and working out, but I also enjoy playing guitar, reading books and playing DnD online. My issue is that I've been struggling with relationships for a while. Its 50% due to moving and travelling so often since COVID. I'm able to get many dates but few of them ever have turned into a real relationship. My longest relationship ever has been 6 months. Just writing that is actually insane.

I recently ended a short relation with a Russian girl because she had to go home for a long time. We tried long distance but it didnt work. Kinda broke my heart because I really liked her. I am at the point in my life where I am so ready for a long term commitment.

After a few months Ive gathered the courage to try dating again. I am very busy with work so I can only go on about 1 date every weekend. This weekend, I had organized a date with a local girl named ""Alina"" (29F) on Friday. Late on Thursday however, another local girl named ""Cassidy"" (29F) told me that she is so bored this week and wants to leave her city on Saturday to come visit me for the whole day. Now I am very open minded about going on dates and seeing if I like someone. Many times, the sparks just aren't there are we mutually say goodbye and never speak again. Normal. What I didn't expect is what ended up happening.

On Friday the date with Alina went really well. We had dinner at 7h30pm. She is Chinese and very feminine, extremely outgoing and into fitness, short, fit body, funny, and lives in the moment. Excellent English. She seems like the kind of girl who would want to move in with her boyfriend pretty soon because she lives with her parents. She wants 3 kids, but doesnt like the idea of marriage \[for some reason\]. She barely parties or drinks.  I really liked her. We kissed and held hands at the end. I missed the last train back to my city at 10pm because I lost track of time. We walked super far along a beautiful broadwalk. She seems very caring, charming, and the sparks were very present between us.

On Saturday the date with Cassidy ALSO went very well. She met me at a coffee shop just outside my apartment. She dropped off her car at my apartment soon after so that we could pickup my ebike and a spare helmet. We then spent the rest of the next 7 hours riding the ebike together all across my city. We had lunch at an amazing wooden tea house, and it started to rain. We sat and drank coffee and chatted for 2 hours while waiting for the rain to subside. She is extremely, fiercely independent. She is tall and slender, and is a surfer girl. She seems to have no close friends. She likes to go to thailand and party about twice a year. She loves to cook. Like, LOVES to cook food for people. She said she wants to open a restaurant one day. I could relate so much with her independence, and dare I say loneliness.  At 7pm we went to a restaurant to have dinner. Came home and watched a movie together. Ended up kissing on my couch for a good while. She went home at 11pm. She is very tender and loving, and there was also a large spark between us.

Help. I like both of them. There wasn't one particularly good or bad thing about either Cassidy or Alina that would make me instantly pick one over the other.  
I am in an impossible situation. It is stupid of me to tell them both that I am dating the other? I just want to be transparent and not lie.

How do I choose? Flip a coin? Vibes? Look for huge green flags and cross reference each with their red flags? I've never been in this situation before. It's like there is no wrong answer but I like them both......... FUCK.

TL:DR  
I went on two dates this weekend with two different girls. I really like them both. I don't know how to choose which girl is better for a relationship :/",3,1762053638.0,relationship_advice,4,0.8,False

1om70ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1om70ki/he_thinks_im_cheating_i_swear_im_not/,He thinks I’m cheating… I swear I’m not..,"I, 30F, am going to do my best to not make this super long but boy do I have a lot to say. My boyfriend, 36M, let’s call him Devin has been accusing me of cheating for the last six months. Ironically, I’m 4 months pregnant. Here’s some context. I started a new job three months before the accusations began, in an apartment community. My community opted to hire a new contractor to live in the property for a discounted price and provide his services in return. Let’s call him Avery. I have always been the type of woman to be open with my partner about who is hitting on me and sometimes what they say if it’s egregious, as I used to bartend and heard the craziest things. Anyway, this contractor wanted me specifically to give him a tour of the building. I politely declined and encouraged a manager to do it so they could discuss the job he wanted him to do, etc. He asked me twice and I still politely declined with the awkward laugh that most women do when they’re uncomfortable. Obviously when I’m getting home, I’m telling Devin about these encounters. I then (foolishly) add that he had a cool car. After the guy officially moves in, I don’t really talk about him anymore because I simply do not see him nor do I care. I guess this was red flag number one for Devin. I do see Avery a few times around the building every now and again. Most of those times was in the leasing office with the whole team and two of those were in the parking garage. First time in the garage, I was leaving for lunch and he stopped me and complimented my car. Second time in the garage, he asked me if I was seeing anyone and I said I was in a happy relationship. He then said “you know I’m next in line right?”. Mind yall, this man has to be about 50 something? Not for me, even if I was single and looking! I responded to him and that point and said we were in it for the long haul so I’m happy where I am, not interested… AT ALL. At that point, I assumed the subtle flirtation is over with. The first accusation Devin made, is that I slept with someone in my house while he wasn’t there. Now mind you, during this time, me and Devin were not officially living together yet, he had a key to my place but he still had his own place. This day of accusation, he was barely speaking to me and then decided that night he was staying home instead of staying over like usual. I thought it was weird but figured maybe he was under alot of pressure with work and simply needed space. Boy was I wrong. He stayed home because he planted his second phone in my house with the voice memo feature actively recording for 24 hours straight. That night, I texted him goodnight and that I loved him. I played gospel music to fall asleep and cuddled with my dog because even though Ive lived alone for a long time before, I get scared and the music calms me. In this recording, he claims it sounds like someone is having sex and moaning. Which is CRAZY to me because I’m a vocal girl during nasty time and I heard none of that when he played it for me. He was associating every little noise of the night to me and a man in cahoots as if there’s not someone who lives above me that walks like it’s war time. Mind you, through the whole recording, the gospel music is playing in the background. I would never do the nasty with the Lords music playing.. that’s just uber disrespectful. Anyway, I denied anything happened because it truly didn’t. This turned into an argument and me in utter confusion. I hate the saying of “if you’re not guilty, you wouldn’t be defensive”. Like no, somebody is lying on me. Damn right I’m defending myself. This also turned into a seemingly never ending topic in this relationship. He’s convinced Avery was in here knocking my doonies down. Mind you all… I’m PREGNANT. I know for some hussies that doesn’t matter but I genuinely love this man and have for years. I would never cheat on him and don’t want to. Especially with his little chicken nugget frying inside me, cmon man. This turned into him taking pictures of my discharge in my underwear, insinuating that it’s from me having sex with Avery in his apartment while I’m at work. I’m not even going to explain female biology in correlation to discharge. I was disgusted because what the hell? Next was, where my phones location was showing “in the building”. If you know anything about iPhones location services, it can show that you’re in the bushes, whole time you’re in the building across the street. I work in a block long building. I have to walk all over it all the time. My location doesn’t always show accurately but whenever he felt like it wasn’t “in the office”, I was apparently with Avery doing backflips on his wee wee. Another time was when he came home, I had been cleaning. Literally shampooing the rug and that was suspicious because maybe I was trying to clean up after having someone here. So many other little things happened. The big blowout was when he punched a hole in the door because he said I was lying. He claimed I had “scratches” on the top of my back. I said, that could quite literally be from me scratching myself or my fur baby when I pick her up. And because I said it could’ve been either/or, he said I was lying. He went through my phone that night in front of me (which he’s had the passcode to since the beginning of our relationship). He had planted his phone again because I had a day off while he was working. Says I was on the phone and wanted to know with who. I went as far as to log into my phone carriers call log, like their literal website (which you can’t edit) so he could see all the calls I had. Since he said I “obviously” deleted it. But when I showed him the call log with the carrier, now I apparently have a different phone, or What’s App, or I called on Facebook messenger. Hold on to this instance, it’s relevant for today’s events that I will explain later. Anyway, that turned into a HUGE argument, he started packing his stuff and walking it to his car. I was so overwhelmed and honestly scared because my dad was abusive growing up so it was really triggering to hear him hit that door. So at that point if he wanted to leave I was gonna let him to protect me and my growing baby. While he was out at his car, I helped get his stuff together in a pile (this pissed him off more). He comes back in and sees, I was helping get his stuff to the door, then says “you were really gonna let me go?” and I said hell yeah. You wanna leave? GO. Especially you’re being violent? I’m pregnant? Go. He ended up not going. Mind you guys, he is really the sweetest thing when we’re not arguing. Helps me up (since I’m a lady whale), rubs my feet, gets whatever snackies I want, brings me coffee or breakfast when he’s available, speaks life into me, cares so genuinely for my family, genuinely loves me. He’s so chivalrous. I don’t even know how much gas is anymore because I haven’t put gas in my car since we started dating and much more! So when he blows up, it’s like a monster is in my home because where’s the sweet man I fell in love with? I know I’m gonna see the good, bad and ugly if I want to spend my life with someone but I don’t know where I’m supposed to draw the line. There’s so much more I could say but for sake of the post I’ll fast forward to now.  So this past weekend we were supposed to go to this event that evening but ended up getting there too late so we just went home. When getting home, this is where I figured out he was mad. Had no idea why, I never know why nowadays. I had to work that day by myself at the office and was pretty busy the whole day. Even ended up staying after closing about 15 minutes to send some last minute emails, this is where I fuxked up. Mind you all, I’m literally on the phone with him, Devin, right at closing while I’m finishing up the work that caused me to leave a few minutes late. Fast forward to Sunday, he leaves for church while I happily oversleep. I wake up and decide to clean all the yucky dust from EVERY surface cus he’s been having allergy issues. Stop by the store to get some new sheets and comforter then I go pick up an air purifier to help even more. Come home and do the damn most y’all. Hours of stuff at six months pregnant. Mind you, we haven’t talked the WHOLE day. Besides me making a post saying “I am not worried, God has me covered” and him replying saying “you posted this for what?”. I essentially responded saying “I’m assuming you’re mad at me and thought I posted this as a sub”. He never responded. Later that night, I’m taking donations for goodwill to my car and clearly see him sitting in his car on the phone. I see him before he sees me. I continue to put the stuff in my car, he sees me see him and then I decide to just go inside. Don’t want to interrupt his call you know. A homegirl of mine calls me and we were on the phone a whole two hours and he still wasn’t inside. I finally text and ask if he wants some food because me and baby are hungry. He says he’ll ride with me. We go get the food, car is silent. When on the way home he asks me to keep straight and at first I’m confused, then I quickly realize he’s directing me to my job. We ride around the garage and he’s clearly looking for Avery’s contractor car (he’s seen it when bringing me breakfast/lunch). Averys vehicle isn’t there, so he tells me to pull over and asks me what unit he lives in. I tell him idk and even if I did, heck no. That turns into another night of arguing but God forbid I’m worried about losing my job while having a baby on the way. Also, remember when I said you needed to remember the thing? Bring that back up now. While we were arguing, I asked who he was on the phone with for two damn hours. He says “how do you know I was on the phone?” I said I saw the signs and saw him before he saw me and he was clearly on the phone. He says he doesn’t have to tell me anything since I’m lying to him about who I was on the phone with (which again I showed him the official call log for to prove his idea of time in his voice recording was wrong). He then stopped me from leaving the apartment. Took my keys and hid them and all. I wanted to leave because I felt like he was being petty and I’m just an emotional hormonal mess. I just went in the closet for about an hour crying. Anyways, he says he’s coming to my job the next day to speak to Avery in person because he “obviously” isn’t getting the truth from me. He sure does show up. Allllll of my workers are at work and wondering why he’s there. He pressures me to call Avery up to the office or else he’s going to ask someone else, and I do. Avery comes up, they step outside and talk. I leave for lunch once Avery comes back in and sure enough, Devin is outside. Still mad. Says he DIDNT get what he needed from Avery. I think he simply won’t believe that I’m not cheating on him because he can’t be wrong. He can’t have wasted all of this energy in trying to catch me doing something that NEVER happened. He said that Avery told him he was living there with his girlfriend. I say that I didn’t know that. Devin says “how do you not know that? so she’s not on the lease or you’ve never seen them come in together?”. I respond and say I’d assume she’s not on the lease but I really didn’t know. And I say that I never seen her, no. There’s so many entrances to that building that don’t come out to the leasing office, 500+ residents, etc. It’s impossible to see everyone all them time. He says that isn’t adding up. So basically he still thinks I’m cheating on him even though he said he just wanted to talk to the man himself to get a “straight answer”. But since he didn’t get the answer he obviously hoped (me actually cheating, which I didn’t), now apparently I MUST be cheating with someone else. I don’t know what else to do at this point. Sorry this is super long but you needed the details. Okay wait, it’s been a week since I originally wrote this and we’d made up. We had an amazing date last night and I mean AMAZING. Anyway… at work yesterday, I didn’t text him back for about 45 minutes. I genuinely wasn’t paying attention. Today, I woke up a little early before work and decided to go ahead and put a load of clothes in the washer. The load was underwear, socks, and night clothes. So those two things plus the fact he came by my job and Avery was there (he saw his work car in the parking lot) made him not trust me. He popped up at work on me today and brought me coffee. Admitted later that he planned to lowkey crash out, ask for my phone and all. Thankfully, I was working alone today. He revealed how he felt right before we were supposed to go to dinner. I honestly didn’t think me washing clothes (I usually do three loads at a time) was suspicious behavior. He says it’s suspicious because he remembers a time in the past where I came home, decided to wash clothes, AND had the audacity to wash the clothes I’d worn to work that day.

1om6wty,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1om6wty/thoughts_on_the_viral_is_having_a_boyfriend/,Thoughts on the viral “Is Having a Boyfriend Embarassing?” conversation from a professional dating coach,"British Vogue recently published an op-ed about women being embarrassed to have boyfriends. It’s a response to a rising trend described as “heterofatalism.”

Women at large are frustrated with men’s dating behaviors and are responding to pessimism about finding a fulfilling partnership by leaning more into platonic friendship. The idea of becoming a lonely, childless cat lady doesn’t inspire fear the way it used to. It’s goals now. As a result, women are opting out of dating and letting romance find them if and when it should. This is evidenced by the complete sausage fest that dating apps have become post-pandemic.

I, however, still *love* love. The hopeless romantic in me will never die. That’s why I dedicate so much time to helping men present their best selves to compete on dating apps and build confidence for approaching women in person. The bar is higher now that there’s no longer social status to be gained from being a partnered woman. If you *really* want a girlfriend, you *really* need to consider what women are looking for in partnerships.

⸻

**Romance**

Every day I get downvoted for being anti–coffee date. I can’t speak for everyone, but I’ve never heard anyone say, “That was the best date I’ve ever been on,” about a coffee date.

This isn’t to say men should spend $200 on a first date. But an easy way to be romantic and show consideration is to think about a woman’s interests when planning. Let’s say her profile mentions that she likes reading and trying new foods. Take her to the landmark library in your city to browse books, then stop by a specialty bakery afterward. Same cost as a coffee date, without the feel of a job interview.

If you want an edge, your date ideas should be fun, memorable, and intentional.

**Security**

Vulnerability is key to any successful relationship. Evolving from just dating to being truly locked-in requires an emotional environment where both people feel seen, respected, and relaxed enough to be their true selves.

Keep your word. If you say you’ll text, call, or show up somewhere…do it. Be honest and use clear language.

A lot of “how to be a player” advice encourages being vague and ambiguous to keep a woman’s attention. That might work on women who rely on male attention for validation, but a quality woman will recognize the games and choose to stay single instead. Keeping a woman you’re interested in on edge is an easy way to make *her* lose interest.


**Emotional Intelligence**

Whenever I ask clients why they want a girlfriend, they usually say it’s because they want someone to talk to about anything. Someone they can feel connected to and comfortable with. Ultimately, they want to be cared for and understood on a deeper level than they get from friends. That’s a deeply emotional desire.

That’s why women today look for emotional intelligence (EQ) in partners more than our mothers or grandmothers ever did. It’s about knowing how to show up for your partner when they’re sharing big feelings, and how to manage your own when they surface.

Do you validate their emotions or try to minimize them to keep the peace? Can you pass the “bird test”? (Look it up.) Are you expressive, or do you bottle things up until they turn into resentment?

We’ve all seen loved ones trapped in relationships on autopilot. Most of us can name a couple who merely tolerate each other, with no emotional closeness left, because one or both partners have withdrawn into themselves. Women today would rather be alone than feel lonely in a shared bed.

⸻

I don’t write all of this to imply that only men need to do the work to build healthy relationships. I’ve written plenty about how women can show up to create more meaningful connections too. My goal isn’t to divide anyone. It’s the opposite. If we spend more time understanding what our partners need to feel fulfilled, we can push back against “heterofatalism” and start loving on each other the way we’re truly meant to.",0,1762053199.0,dating_advice,22,0.38,False

I had PPA and had this underlying feeling something was ‘wrong’ all the time. I could never quite put my finger on it. I just always felt like I was searching for something in my son I couldn’t quite grasp. Not that it was missing, but that I couldn’t quite get to it. And I really wanted and craved this thing, whatever it was. I was so attached to him, and I felt he was so attached to me. But I was looking for something from him he couldn’t quite give me? It’s really weird to type it out but that’s how it felt.

We started baby classes and I noticed other babies were a lot more interested in me than my own. They were a lot more expressive too. I briefly mentioned this, but everyone said “oh don’t be silly”. You just think that because of PPA. And I did feel silly for saying it, and so guilty too.

Over this time I started therapy, medication, counselling but the feeling never went away. I just sort of started to made my peace with it. 

Then we met up with a friend for coffee whose baby was a bit younger. Her baby looked at me. Like, REALLY looked at me. It felt like into my soul! I genuinely think I might have gasped. It was only on the way home I thought “SHIT, that’s what it is”. 

My son had never really looked at me. Like, properly looked. That’s why I had PPA! I didn’t just think that because I had anxiety, I had anxiety because of that! 

He has grown into the most loving, fun, sweet little boy. He still doesn’t really ‘look’ at me, but now sometimes I do catch a little fleeting glimpse of what I remember always searching for and it is just the most amazing thing.",13,1762052957.0,Autism_Parenting,10,0.94,False

(Today) 
I usually bicycle to work on a hybrid E bike. I live ten minutes from my workplace (for reference me and my partner both live together). Today, the back tire of my bike, got a flat. Knowing my partner was off work. I gave them a call. I wanted to know if they were home and they advised me they were at a coffee shop working on an essay for a university program that was due within four hours, but they planned to complete it within two. For more backstory, they have been aware of this program for months and today is the deadline. When I asked them if they could pick me up due to the flat, they said they could, but I would have to leave my bike at my workplace because they didn’t have time to move their car around to load the bike in and they wanted to finish their essay. As the conversation went on, I felt guilty and didn’t want to take them away from their work however, I also felt frustrated because if the roles were switched, I wouldn’t have blinked an eye to go pick them up and continue my studies. For more reference the Coffee shop they were at was less than five minutes away from our home. I was also confused on why I couldn’t help them rearrange their car when they arrived and I had to leave my bike. I told them it was okay and I would walk home. However, the weight of the bike because it is a hybrid was frustrating pushing, and I could feel it was starting to get cold. I texted them to let them know because we had been arguing a lot over things like this that I didn’t wanna fight with them when we got home, but I was upset that they didn’t come and pick me up. My partner told me that if I wanted to be picked up that I needed to ask. I completely agree by the way. It is important to advocate for your needs, however, due to the amount of arguing we’ve been going through and stress I was more concerned that if their essay or application did not go as planned, they would blame me because I needed the ride. 
After a few back-and-forth text messages, they called and said they were coming to pick me up. I was sad and worried because last night was a good night for us after a hard week of arguments and almost separating. It was sad to think that me asking for help could have caused this tension. I completely understand her stress and the deadline. From my perspective, I just couldn’t help but see how little time it might’ve taken to help. Yet I can’t help but understand that every second counts. 
When she had picked me up, we rearranged her car as I thought we would and got the bike loaded in, and she dropped me off at home. The car ride was quiet. and I was concerned and worried that this would be an argument later and I still am. She then left back to the coffee shop and I assume she is completing her work.
I’ve talked to my best friend about this many times and she has told me that I am aware of who I am dating and unfortunately, I choose how long I stay. I do not want to leave my partner. I feel we have a lot of potential. However, situations like this continuously happen. Scenarios where I constantly step up, but my partner does not has continued to occur. We recently had a conversation about change and how it looks to meet one another’s needs. I’m not sure what advice I’m looking for. But I am struggling feeling like I matter to my own partner and this is just one scenario out of many we have went through. 

She had texted me earlier that it was no big deal to pick me up and that accidents happen. This is sitting wrong with me, but I’m not sure how to approach it. I know I should be carrying a hand pump and a patch kit. If I’m going to be biking consistently, I just haven’t had the time to go to the store and buy one. 

I want to believe she is just stressed and this will pass. I am well aware that there might not always be a solution to our problems, but we have to try our best together. I have seen her go above and beyond before for me. It feels like there was a sudden switch and I couldn’t pinpoint when it happened, all I know is I grew more upset and she started to care less. 

(Prior) 
I had confronted her before about if the relationship was really what she wanted based off of her behavior. she had told me she had been struggling with mental health and agreed that we both needed to go back to therapy. I was confused as to why I may have to go back to therapy as well for her to feel comfortable considering my therapist had told me I had made a lot of progress when I told them I wanted to step away and they trusted I would do good with the tools we had learned And I could always come back. She also stated she wanted a relationship with me, but felt we both needed to go back to better our relationship. 

She has openly admitted to being jealous of me, and had a period of where she felt so emotionless she didn’t care when she was upsetting me, but advised me this was due to a decline in mental health. 

I don’t want to think my relationship is doomed i care for my partner v much and have seen them at there best and want to see them get through the worst. However it is dragging me down too. ",2,1762052909.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1om6lwg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1om6lwg,"Pallet rack mug,tumbler,phone,tablet holder updated design.","I finally decided to update my design for my pallet rack interfacing for my mug and tablet holder that I use at my workstation in my warehouse. This way I can keep track of orders and first thing in the morning I can keep the coffee going down my throat.

I added a USB cable holder to make sure that my cord is out of the way and not getting onto my workstation. I also made the pins that interface with the racking screw in and sized them bolts to a 3/16ths Allen key. Though I may just redesign them specifically for a flat head for easy of putting in.

Next I'll be designing one that will hang from the inside edge of the rack to hold my table inside and out of the way at probably about a 30 degree angle so it can be seen easily from rest of the workstation but also be out of the way when I need to access the top of that section of rack for pallets stored out of the way up there. Granted the forklift doesn't even need to be that close to the area I put my tablet as it is but it's more for just general desire to make more mounting bracket designs that can be used for these kinds of applications.

I also need to add a security pin so these can't be bumped out by accident. Pretty easy to do I just haven't done so yet as I have been experimenting with the thread sizes and so on to get them right for this application. ",1,1762052243.0,3Dprinting,0,1.0,False

I’ve been writing a short story series called *My Sundown Semester*. It’s kind of half *slice-of-life college drama*, half *“what if something weird really did happen during junior year?”* Think late nights, burnout, awkward crushes, and maybe a few powers nobody signed up for.

This first chapter introduces Ronnie, who’s just trying to make it through her first semester of junior year without completely falling apart… or accidentally showing that she might not be entirely normal.

I’d love any feedback, especially on tone and pacing—thanks for giving it a read!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone on the team says that baseball is ninety percent mental and ten percent physical. But for me, it’s more of a fifty-fifty split — keeping my swing consistent, and not dashing *too* fast around the bases.



Oh! Sorry for just jumping right in, I’m Veronica Day. All my friends just call me Ronnie.



“Veronica” sounds like someone who has her life together, and I definitely don’t.



I’m twenty-one, and a college junior at Lakeshore University in Chicago, Illinois, who lives in an off-campus apartment with a roommate who keeps trying to get me to “embrace the morning”. I’ve lost count of how many times she’s tried to drag me out of the house on 7 am jogs, but I do my best to pretend I’m a morning person for her.



It’s not going great. But hey, I’ve stopped hissing at the sunrise. Progress!



Today, I was just getting ready for class in my room when suddenly my roommate, Annie, barged in and brandished her phone at me. “What’s this about, Day?” She asked with a mischievous smile.



“What am I looking at, Annie?” I replied as I pulled up the hood on my hoodie.

It was a Chicago Tribune headline that read “Day Family Donates Fortune To Children’s Hospital”. There was a picture below the headline of my mom, Vivienne Day, signing one of those giant checks you see on daytime game shows.



“Oh, yeah, that,” I replied, looking down at my sneakers.



Annie’s mood suddenly seemed to shift. She got down on my level and turned her smile from mischievous to warm. “Hey, I’m not trying to be catty or anything. I wish my family did cool stuff like that; you should be proud.”



“Yeah, I don’t know. Being in the news has kind of always been our thing. It gets old faster than you’d think.” I replied.



That sentence seemed to hang in the air between us for a second, but then suddenly Annie perked up again.



“Oh! Here, I know what would make you feel better! Can I make you a smoothie? Blueberry and banana, it’s super yummy!”



I craned my neck past her, standing in front of me, to see her mini blender on the counter of our shoebox of a kitchen. Yup, there was a tall glass filled with blueish-purple liquid.



“Oh, thanks!” I replied with a well-disguised smile, “I’ll stick with one of my black-cherry protein shakes.”



“Oh, okay, that’s cool.” Annie started to leave my room, “You should get going, though. Didn’t you say your Advanced Communication Studies professor is a real hardass about being late? Which one was he?”



“Professor Nagle. Yeah, he’s tough, but I’m on his good side!” I stood up and followed her out to the kitchen, “Let’s try and keep it that way!” We both laughed, and I carefully reached into the fridge to get one of my protein shakes. One of my protein shakes that I *never* take out of the black plastic bottle that I put it in originally -- when Annie was asleep, of course. 



We walked and talked together on our way to the train. This time of year is my favorite; the autumnal chill in the air reminds me so much of being little and playing around my family’s estate. The dark, leaf-bare trees always seemed to tower above as I’d play hide and seek with my dad. I’ve always been really short, so I had no shortage of places I could hide in that big yard. Sometimes I’d even just bury myself in a big pile of leaves and let out quick little giggles as my dad would walk right by me, saying in an exaggerated tone, “Hmmmm… I wonder where Ronnie could have gone to hide!” Then I’d jump out and yell, “Here I am!” Those days seem like only yesterday, but also a lifetime ago.



Suddenly, my little nostalgia trip is interrupted by the train’s intercom. 



*“Diversey. Diversey is next.”*



I guess that means we’d better get ready to step off. Our stop is next. It always strikes me that I chose this life of my own accord. My family’s estate is right over in Lincoln Park, and they practically own half the neighborhood that Annie and I live in. Yet here I am -- a college student actually making my own way in the world, not just signing giant checks or sitting through another one of those lavish, secret dinners, where the Day legacy keeps being bolstered by both ethical and not-so-ethical means alike. 



Right now, though, as we get off the train, Annie is talking to me about having our third good friend, Marisol, over for pizza tonight. 



“Yeah! She’s really excited about that new play she’s in,” Annie says in an excited voice.



“Good for her,” I reply, “Mari always just owns the stage when she steps out under all that light. She’s been that way ever since I first met her in the cafeteria during the first week of sophomore year.”



“If I recall correctly,” Annie began, trying to contain her laughter.



And oh boy, she’s not wrong.



“She was with her theater buddies singing the words to a cabaret-style cover of ‘All Star’ by Smash Mouth and spilled the chocolate milk you were drinking when she tried dancing next to your table.” 



She’s not lying, that’s exactly how Mari and I first met, and even if I was really pissed in the moment, it’s crazy how fast we became friends soon after. She immediately apologized and brought me a bunch of napkins from a nearby dispenser; That being the napkin dispenser right at my two-person table. She then told her theater buddies that she’d catch up with them later, and started chatting me up about the homework I was reading up on for my History of Broadcast Media class: “From Monty Python to Carol Burnett -- The Way Satire Revolutionizes Generations”. 



Her face lit up when she started telling me about all her favorite skits from Monty Python, and how much she loved absurd, over-the-top comedy. She then asked me what the funniest thing I’d seen that day was. When I told her I didn’t know, and that my days were usually pretty quiet, she started telling me all the corniest jokes she could think of until I was almost head-down on the table with laughter. Not really because her jokes were funny, but more because I was touched that she really, genuinely wanted to make my day brighter.



We arrive at the “Letters and Sciences Building”, and Annie turns right to go to her Seminar on Desert Ecology, as I turn left to go to Advanced Communication Studies. I get in my seat right on time, but today it’s Professor Nagle who’s late! Finally, after around five minutes, he comes into the room fumbling through his notes for the day. About thirty-five pairs of eyes follow him as he goes over to the desk at the front of the room. 



“I know, I know,” he began exasperatedly, “it’s usually me who’s chastising all of you who are late. I’m human too, though.”



When that little appeal seems to fall on deaf ears, it’s time to break out the heavy artillery.



“Okay, well, we have a lot to get to today. So much, in fact, that we don’t even have time for the pop quiz I was going to give all of you!” 

A guy behind me let out a half-hearted “Yay…” which moved us along to getting into class and got a few laughs. Professor Nagle isn’t a bad professor; he’s just really quiet and doesn’t exactly know how to handle awkward situations. He also tends to ramble and meander through the actual lecture material, from growing up in Bridgeport and how much he knows Chicago, to the 2006 Chicago White Sox, to the perfect soda bread recipe. But I guess we always end up where we’re supposed to by the end of class. 



After class, I have half an hour for a cup of coffee and a sandwich before I go to my second class of the day: Digital Video Editing. I’m not really the best with technology and computers, but I still love this class. Most of what we do is edit footage together to make commercials and short broadcast segments. I really don’t like being in front of a camera for various reasons, but I like being able to just sink back in a chair and be productive for a while without having to talk to many other people. The class is really small, too. Much smaller than Advanced Communication Studies, it’s only around ten people. 



When that class is done, I put in my earbuds and sit on a bench outside for a few minutes to enjoy the day before I head back to the apartment. Annie’s going to be going to her part-time job at the campus bookstore, so I’ll have the place to myself for a little while. 



I honestly wonder how long I’ll be able to stay here without being pulled back into the never-ending soap opera that is the Day family. I don’t mean stay here, like at Lakeshore, but more so stay in this kind of life. Despite my health conditions and family shadow that follows me wherever I go, I love this current life and where it’s leading me! Annie, Mari, and I are all great friends. I’m really getting more and more interested in video editing. So much so, in fact, that I think I’d like a job in it one day. *Ronnie Day: Independent Video Consultant*. I like it.



After a few minutes, the sun gets to be too much for me, so I get back on the train and go back to the apartment. As I get off the train, I see a really adorable labradoodle walking with his owner towards me, but when I smile and reach out a hand for a pet, he freezes up and darts to the other side of his owner, a little old grandma.



“Oh, that’s strange. He’s usually really friendly with strangers. I wonder what’s gotten into him?” said the old lady, as the dog began to growl.



It’s at moments like these that I feel a sudden falling in my chest. That I’m not like the other people around me. Even though I have dreams about leading a life away from aristocracy, I feel like one day fate will just rip the mask off of the secret I’ve been trying so hard to distance myself from. If even the freakin’ dog on the street can figure it out, one day everyone else will, too.



In all of my brooding, I found that I’d walked myself home and was now on my bed in the dark, feeling a tear form in the corner of my eye. I pull the throw on my bed up over me, almost as if to just get away from everything in the world.



Suddenly, I heard the front door creak open, and Annie’s voice made its way into my room.



“Ronnie? I’m home!” 



Immediately, I wiped my eyes, threw off the blanket, and planted a random book on my bed to make it look like I wasn’t just crying. 



*The instruction manual from my laptop. Because nothing screams ‘emotional stability’ like a little light reading on system settings.*



One look in the mirror to make sure my eyes didn’t look too weird, and I walked out to meet her.



“Wow, you’re home awfully late,” I said jokingly.



“Am I?” Annie replied with a smirk, “I was just out buying some smokes. God, Woman, why you gotta be all up in my grill?”



“You don’t even smoke, and we don’t have a grill,” I replied with a laugh.



Annie just smiled and rolled her eyes. 



“Now, come on!” she said, gesturing down our short hallway to the living room. “Don’t you remember what we’re doing tonight?” 



*Oh crap! That’s right! Pizza with Mari!*



“Yeah, pizza!” I replied, trying to mask the fact that I completely forgot all about Mari. “What time is she getting here?” 



“Oh, yeah. I think she said --” and at that moment, we both heard a sudden voice yelling out from the courtyard below: “Hello?! Hello up there?! Please let me in! I’m but a starving, sweet little girl…”



“She’s here,” we both say in unison, trying to contain our laughter.



Annie goes down the stairs to let her up, and I turn on the oven to heat up the pizza she has for us to share. 

When Mari walks in the door, my mood immediately lights up. She got us pizza from Dante’s just up the street, my favorite! They’re always so cool about skipping the garlic butter on their crust. And if I know our little friend group, we ordered our ‘za with a third-pepperoni for me, a third pepperoni and pineapple for Annie (she will *never* convert me), and a third with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes for Mari. The cooks at that place must either love us or hate us. 



“Mari! You brought Dante’s!” I cried.



“Ronnie! I brought Dante’s!” She responded with a nod and a smile.



I walked up to Mari to take the pizza to the kitchen, but just when I reached up my arms to take the box, she set it down on the coffee table and pulled me into a big hug.



After two seconds, I can’t breathe and start trying to wriggle free. After another eight seconds of trying to break free of Annie joining in for a giant group hug, I finally manage to push them both off of me.



Soon enough, we all have a glass of iced tea and are sitting around our coffee table eating deliciously hot pizza. Mari has an episode of Mr. Bean playing on our TV for background noise as we chat about our days.



“And then I came here, and got my hug rejected by bite-sized Ronnie,” Mari laughed.



“Mari, you’re a great friend,” I began with a smirk, “but when you and all your tallness bears down on my little five-foot-four self, it’s a lot to take in.”



“She’s only six inches taller,” remarked Annie, “how *a lot* can it possibly be?” 



Mari stood up from her spot on the couch and dramatically sang “I’m just full of so much love for my friends!”



You know what, maybe this is kind of the answer to what I had thought about earlier today. There might be a lot of things on my mind, and a lot of things that I’m hiding from the world, but I have the two best friends a woman could ever ask for sitting on either side of me on this couch. Do they break out into song *way* too much, ambush me with sudden hugs and pineapple up my poor, defenseless pizza? Yes. 



But they also always know how to make me feel better, make sure I’m always included and at home in everything we do, and are here for me when I need them. Even if I’m not totally “right” with the world, I know I’ll always be right in the eyes of my best friends.

Some nights, I’d walk out to the pen, sit on the fence, and he’d come stand by me like he was guarding what was left of my heart. I’ve spilled more sweat and blood than I care to count on the line, in the woods, under a sky that don’t always give a damn. But that horse? He gave a damn. Every damn day. He carried more than gear and tack. He carried my silence, my grief, the guilt I never knew how to unload. And he never once buckled. There’s something sacred about an animal that’ll let you put your pain in their hands... hell, their hooves and carry it without question. He never judged the days I rode quiet or the mornings I drank coffee like it was penance. He just kept walking forward, steady as time. That horse didn’t save my life in the big, dramatic way folks like to write songs about. No hero moment. No blaze of glory. He just stayed. He listened.

1om6h5w,https://i.redd.it/qlscqsp6cryf1.jpeg,"Crazy SNL stories #6: On Halloween Night, 1980, John Belushi forces punk band Fear on the show, O'Donoghue's sketches are deemed too gory, and the on-air riot that forced producer Ebersol to fade to black.","**From Bob Woodward,** ***Wired*****:**

The next night, Friday, September 25 (1980), John Belushi was in the Guitar Center, a slick, professional music store on Sunset in Hollywood, looking for some new kind of computer drum machine. He was with Tino Insana, his old friend from the Universal Life Coffee House days, and Aykroyd. Also in the store that night was a tall, thin twenty-nine-year-old. He was rather conservative looking, except for the fishing lure dangling from one of his ears. John was introduced to him.

He was Derf Scratch, a guitar player for a punk band, Fear. His real name was Frederick C. Millner III; “Derf” was “Fred” spelled backward. He went with John and the others to On the Rox for drinks. John had a hundred questions about punk music and Fear, Derf’s four-member group, which had been together for three years.

…

**T**om Scott was the thirty-three-year-old jazz-rock saxophonist from the Blues Brothers … Scott had previously done the background theme music for a number of television shows (“Starsky and Hutch,” “Baretta,” “Streets of San Francisco”) and a few movies, including Columbia’s 1980 hit *Stir Crazy.* On John’s recommendation, he had been given the job several weeks earlier of scoring about 50 minutes of original music for *Neighbors.* He was consumed by the task. It took a full day of detailed work to score about three minutes’ worth of music.

…

On the second day of scoring with the orchestra, Wednesday, September 30, Scott got a call from John, who was to do the vocals on the title song and was over at a recording studio in town.

“There’s a problem,” John said. “Come down.”

When Scott walked into the studio, John, Derf, and the three other band members from Fear were blasting forth with an angry, savage sound, composing their own punk title song, “Neighbors,” for the movie. The music was an upheaval of noises and overinstrumentation.

“This is a punk picture,” John said to Scott. “I want people to tear the seats out.” There was a pause in the music. “This space here is for your sax solo,” John said, inviting Scott to join the band.

Scott listened in silence, wondering whether John had finally flipped out. This was deranged. John couldn’t unilaterally decide on new music, and no studio would put a punk song on a major movie release.

…

The next morning, Friday, October 2, Zanuck and Brown were in their Columbia office when John, unannounced, burst in so fast that Zanuck thought he might go through the wall into the next office. John had his father in tow.

John explained that he had found the solution to all their music problems—a new punk group called Fear that would brilliantly serve the deep, radical, lawless drive of the movie.

Zanuck and Brown said they had never heard of Fear. Brown wondered whether it might not be a good idea to end the movie with something like Bing Crosby singing “Love Thy Neighbor.” The irony would not be lost.

John threw himself into a tirade about the misconceptions that were guiding their movie. Punk was kids’ music, and it would draw them to the movie.

…

The music began, and John turned the volume up. Berres tried to suppress a wince. It seemed to be a rhythm beat with some screeching in the background, an absolute atrocity. Punk music, the antithesis of the classics Berres loved.

The others in the room indicated in one way or another that they couldn’t understand the lyrics, so John turned up the volume. He started dancing around the room, singing the words.

Berres tried to turn down the volume, but John wouldn’t have it, starting the song from the beginning again and turning it up even higher. Each time the song was finished, he rewound the tape and played it again.

Schrager finally got up and told Berres that he had to get on to other business. “You son of a bitch,” Berres whispered.

Zanuck and Brown couldn’t stand it either and finally left.

Berres was now alone with Belushi, who was on about his fifth time through the song.

“Isn’t this the greatest fucking piece of music you’ve ever heard?” John asked, at last stopping the tape.

…

Meanwhile, John was devoting the week to working with Fear on perfecting their *Neighbors* song. On Monday they had a 6-hour session; on Tuesday, 13½ hours; Joel Briskin was overseeing the work and sending out for beer, pizzas or whatever John and the musicians wanted.

One night John gave Briskin $600 in cash and asked him to get a quarter of an ounce of cocaine. “I’ve got to have stuff for the kids,” he said.

Briskin went to a supplier he knew and brought back the drug.

John told the band that he was going to get their music into the movie at any cost. If their song was not used, he promised to shave his head bald like a punk skinhead as a sign of protest. Then he would go on television talk shows, and when asked why he was a skinhead, he would explain about the music, the fucked director, producers and studio.

…

When the tape of the Fear song was finally completed, John took it to Avildsen, who had promised Price that he would at least listen.

Avildsen cringed. The music had no melody and it was ugly. But Avildsen tempered his remarks. Though the music was important, it was secondary to the movie itself, and there was no time for a prolonged argument with John.

“I don’t think it’s appropriate,” Avildsen said. It seemed too jarring, he said, and it did not relate to what John’s character was supposed to feel at the end.

John said they had to get a better stereo system. Avildsen obviously had not had a chance to get the full feel. John tried to find a better sound system but failed. He finally told Avildsen emphatically, “This music is going to be in the movie.”

“Stranger things have happened,” Avildsen replied.

“What do you mean?” John asked belligerently.

“Stranger things have happened than for inappropriate music to be in a movie,” Avildsen said. He felt angry, not only at John but at the producers and Columbia for second-guessing him at every turn. “It doesn’t have my vote. Go talk to the people who are paying for the movie. I just work here.”

\[Belushi failed  to get the song into the movie\]

John convinced “Saturday Night Live” to have Fear as the music group for the Halloween show, Saturday, October 31, and he agreed to do a cameo appearance. Several dozen skinheads, avid and sometimes violent punk fans, were invited to slam dance on stage during the songs.

**From Hill and Weingrad,** ***Saturday Night*****:**

O’Donoghue’s last shot at having some control over *Saturday Night* came on the season’s fourth show, which fell, fittingly enough, on Halloween. As it happened, Dick had fallen passionately in love with the host of the second show that year, Susan Saint James, and, during the week off preceding the Halloween show, he was in California wooing her. They would marry a month later. Dick wanted the staff to keep working in his absence, and he left the show in O’Donoghue’s hands. O’Donoghue made the most of the opportunity.

The host was Donald Pleasence, who’d starred in the movie *Halloween,* among other horror films, and who fit quite comfortably into a number of ghoulish sketches that evolved over the week. In one, written by Lyon and Southern, he played an aging sophisticate dining with an attractive young woman. Near the end of the sketch, the camera was to pull back to reveal that the wine he’d been pouring throughout the meal came not from the bottle sitting on the table, but from an intravenous tube that was draining blood from her arm. In another sketch, written by O’Donoghue, Pleasence played the commander of a Nazi death camp who had a perfectly good excuse (which he whispered inaudibly to several people) for slaughtering thousands of Jews. The point, of course, was that there could never be an excuse. A third sketch, called “Grand Guignol White House,” written by Lyon and Pam Norris, had Pleasence playing Ronald Reagan, who, along with his family and top aides, hacked Jane Fonda to pieces and ate her for dinner.

When Dick returned to the 17th floor on Monday, he was appalled at the material O’Donoghue had prepared. “Blood, blood, blood,” is how Ebersol described it. He immediately killed the three Pleasence sketches, causing O’Donoghue to walk off the show temporarily, and set other writers to work on less gory ideas. He did, however, go along with the musical group that O’Donoghue, at the suggestion of John Belushi, had insisted be booked, a punk rock group from Los Angeles called Fear.

Fear was, even by punk’s standards, a savage ensemble (their bass player was named Derf Scratch, the drummer, Spit Stix), which was why Belushi loved them. Belushi and O’Donoghue had arranged for thirty-five or so of Fear’s rowdy fans to take a bus up from Washington so they could slam dance in 8H as the band played.

During dress rehearsal, some of the slam dancers got carried away, cursing and tumbling off the set, banging into one cameraman and nearly colliding with some of the others. The song was stopped in the middle to cool them down. When dress ended, members of the technical crew complained vehemently to Davey Wilson, and Wilson told Dick that the crew was threatening to walk off the show unless the slam dancers were dropped. Dick told him the dancers would go on, but he went up to see them in the greenroom to lay down some rules. O’Donoghue went with him, but only to watch.

Wearing a pair of gray flannel slacks and a sweater, Dick told the roomful of punks—“ridiculous-looking people,” he later called them—that they had to keep themselves in check. He specifically warned that they shouldn’t swear, since there were live microphones in the studio that would instantly broadcast any profanities to millions of viewers across the country. Dick didn’t mention it, but for the air show, during Fear’s song, he took the precaution of turning off all the mikes in the studio except the singer’s.

On-air, the slam dancers showed no sign of thinking for a moment about what Dick had told them. They threw themselves at each other with what seemed to be complete abandon, jumping off the stage headfirst and careening around the studio while the band blasted away deafeningly. All the running around kicked up a great deal of dust in the studio, so that everything looked hazy and distorted. It created a truly striking effect that resembled, as Nelson Lyon described it, “an after-hours Nuremberg rally.” Michael O’Donoghue, watching backstage, had a look of pure ecstasy on his face, convinced that this was one of TV’s greatest moments ever.

But to Dick Ebersol, crouched out of camera range near the stage, things seemed to be getting out of hand. He heard somebody yell “New York sucks!” and saw one of the dancers heading toward the singer’s microphone. Frantically, Dick got up and ran as fast as he could into the control room and shouted at Dave Wilson, “Fade to black! Fade to black!” On-screen the image of Fear disappeared, abruptly replaced by a filmed bit from an earlier show, which Wilson kept cued up in case of just such an emergency. Order had been restored.

When the slam dancers, supposedly berserk, saw the stage lights go out and realized they were no longer on-air, they immediately stopped dancing and walked peacefully off the set. Dick, on the other hand, was so livid he kicked a trash can halfway across the control room. A few days later he was further incensed when the *New York Post* reported, completely inaccurately, that there had been a riot in the studio causing $200,000 worth of damage. In truth, a plastic camera-case lock worth something like $40 had been broken.

Dick immediately launched an all-out public-relations drive to counter the *Post*’s story. Peter Hamilton, the NBC press representative assigned to *Saturday Night* at the time, said Dick couldn’t bear the accusation that for a moment he’d lost control of his show.

**From Shales & Miller, Live From New York\_ An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live (2003):**

**DICK EBERSOL:**

John Belushi had become convinced that Fear, which was this punk kind of rock group, were on the verge of breaking out and convinced me that I ought to book them and personally vouched that they were terrific and so on. Anyway, their musical number — in the last fifteen or twenty minutes of the show — was so dark. They had films in it showing pumpkins that, as you carved the pumpkin, blood came out of each carving. It was just like O’Donoghue at his darkest. And I, quite frankly, had given him too much freedom. But now here I am with Fear itself. We’re on the air. And all of a sudden they’re out of control and there are dancers around them — including John, who you can’t see on television — and they’re slam-dancing, that’s what it was called, banging off each other, banging into the audience, banging into cameramen. None of this was really foreseen. And things got really, completely, and totally out of hand. And so you’re sitting at home and you’re watching this, and you don’t really have the total sense of what we could see, because Davey Wilson in the booth was not shooting what was breaking out in the lower areas of the audience, where people sit on those movable chairs.

And I think probably, for the only time in the history of the show, I had been worried about it enough to have told Davey to at least have a film standing by. It was a sensational film that had aired in the first show, four weeks before, on October third, with Eddie playing a black inmate who wrote poetry in iambic pentameter or something like that. It was a takeoff on whoever Norman Mailer loved at the time, who was a wronged guy in prison, and a wonderful piece of character. And so I told them to roll it. And so we just rolled the film.

We let Fear finish in the studio, and I don’t think they knew until they were back in their dressing room that the last half of their song had gone away. Anyway, the total damage that was done in the studio was about $2,500. But the *New York Post* headline on Monday was, “Saturday Night Live Riot Destroys $250,000.”

**DAVE WILSON:**

It was like mosh pit kind of stuff, with people diving off the stage into the audience. And all I remember is Dick Ebersol actually running around, ducking underneath the cameras, trying to quiet it all down.",5,1762051822.0,Crazy_retro_stories,0,1.0,False

1om6fv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1om6fv5/how_can_my_family_help_my_sister_with_her_fear_of/,How can my family help my sister with her fear of riding in cars?,"From January to now my family and I have gotten into 3 incidents while driving. They did not damage the car or anyone in them and were relatively minor. My 13 year old sister, however, does not see them this way. She is absolutely terrified of riding in the car.

The incidents were:
1. January: 2022 Hyundai Tucson started rumbling oddly on the highway and forced us to pull over. It’s important to mention that my parents were stressed and started arguing, and my sister was extra upset because she had never seen them argue like that before. We got home safely and ended up selling the car after the dealership refused to fix it (a separate confusing situation) 
2. April: Hit a random bolt (like a legit metal bolt) on the highway that flattened a tire. No biggie, the police helped us close the lane and we got a spare on. We were home safely in like an hour or less. 
3. July: Hit a cement guardrail on the way home from vacation. Also important to add that the jolt of the vehicle scared my sister awake. The only thing that happened was the one tire was flattened; the body of the car was not even scratched, and everyone inside was safe but a little shaken. We put the spare on and made it home safely.

These were not big deals to me, but my sister cannot ride in the car for more than like 20 minutes without crying or having a panic attack. I 100% understand that it’s much scarier for her, not only because she’s younger but because she cannot drive herself, so she doesn’t quite understand what’s going on behind the wheel. 

After the first thing with the Tucson, she suddenly cancelled her birthday trip. I would later find out it was because she didn’t want to be in the car. 

Nothing else car related has happened to my knowledge, but something has changed and she is suddenly worse than ever. I learned this a week ago when we drove home from a family event; when my mother, who was driving, complained about a semi in front of her, my sister suddenly started crying and then had a panic attack. This was completely out of left field and we didn’t know what to do.

I suddenly realized that this was why she’d been acting weird when I would pick her up from school within the past few weeks: she was scared of being in the car. She would get moody and ask to go straight home instead of running some typical errands with me. She’s also been biting the hell out of her nails and won’t look at her phone or do anything while in the car; she just watches out the window. 

My car is in the shop right now, so I took my dad’s car (a 2007) to get breakfast with my grandparents this morning. She did the thing again where she wouldn’t look at her phone and would just stay watching. She started crying on the way home after I went out of the way to get coffee because she didn’t want to be in the car any longer and said that the car was unsafe because of its age. I learned the only car she feels remotely safe in is the GMC. We later went to a family gathering in the GMC and she cried a few times while we were on the highway (highway duration was less than an hour). My mom gave her some kind of calming spray/oil that seemed to at least placebo its way into calming her down enough to play video games on the way home.

My family has started talking about ways to help her. We are trying to save therapy as a last resort because she seems unreceptive to the idea and because the therapist I go to doesn’t accept patients under 14, but she can’t keep living this way. All she does is worry about the next time she’ll be in the car; she wouldn’t play video games or watch YouTube with me this morning because she was just sitting on her phone and worrying about the car ride. We are all sad and worried for her.

Before we decide to get her therapy, what are some ways we might be able to help her without it? If therapy is the only way, be honest with me, but we really want to look for some other ideas. ",1,1762051707.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1om6ens,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1om6ens/geimori_gu64/,Geimori GU64,"So, I am in the market for a grinder. I have watched the Coffee Chronicler’s review of the 74 Navigator, a couple reviews on the Geimori GU64, lots of reviews on the Ode Gen 2, the Timemore 064, and then there is something like the Philos, which I am unreasonably in love with. There are others I am sure, but I’ve kind of narrowed it down to these. 

The Philos is pretty much at or near the top of my range, and I like the fact it is a well established brand. I am either looking my for a grinder which can do well with both espresso and pour over, and switch pretty effortlessly and intuitively back and forth, or I would like to have two dedicated grinders that are reasonably sized, as my counter top space is limited. 

I currently run an SJ clone (HC600) with I189D burrs. I think it does pretty well for my espresso, but puts a little too much “heaviness” in the cup, for lack of a better term. It does ok, and I’ve had it for years (replaced the burrs last year, and whoa what a difference), but was interested in something new.  It is just kind of a pain to go back and forth for dialing in as I typically will do an espresso at home and a pour over to take with me to work every day. It would be nice to either have a grinder which could do the double duty more easily, or just have a couple grinders side by side. 

I’ve had a look at the Femobooks as well since they do the compact thing really well, but I don’t like the battery power or the long grind times. I will often do a 65g dose to take with me to work to brew in my Bunn, so a little more speed is preferable. Curious on all your thoughts and what kind of grinder journey some of you have been on with any of these grinders. Thanks!

We immediately fell in love with it and we decided to take it to the emergency room. When we got there, we had to figure out payments and wait for an x-ray scan. It wasn’t until around 7 PM we were able to receive results. We were under the assumption that maybe the kitten’s femur was broken, but that was not the case. 
When we saw the x-rays, it was heartbreaking. The lower spine was completely separated and her pelvis was broken. 
My boyfriend and I are both devasted. We became attached. We spent time envisioning our lives with our new kitten and immediately our dreams were shot down. 
Out of the three options we were presented, we ultimately decided to euthanize the kitten. It was a hard decision but given the circumstances of the injuries, we believe it was beyond our control.

This is a throwaway, and I have changed some details to remain as anonymous as possible.

For some background;
I (25F) work with two of my best friends, ""Lisa"" (35F) and ""Kelly"" (33F). Lisa and Kelly have been dating and living together for over a decade, and they run a mom-and-pop Cafe together, with Lisa being the store manager and Kelly being the assistant manager. I work as a full-time lead at their cafe. Kelly and I met 7 years ago at another coffee-related job, and have been close ever since. We formed a sisterly bond that has been strong since day 1. I had met Lisa around this time as well, but did not get super close to her until I started working at their cafe, about 3 years ago now. The 3 of us are extremely close, we share a lot of interests in common, and there have never been any issues between us up until recently. 

For some context about Kelly, we had bonded over the years due to both of us struggling with depression. Mine has since improved after a stint with some SSRI medications, but she continues to struggle, and she remains on multiple antidepressant and anxiety medications. Lately, things appeared to have gotten worse for her - she started to slack on all of her responsibilities, both at work and at home. Lisa and I were picking up a lot of her slack at work, and Lisa would confide in me how hard things have been at home due to Kelly not contributing to household chores, not taking care of their pets, and essentially making her work around the clock both at work and at home to keep things maintained. I tried to talk to Kelly multiple times about how she was feeling; asked her if maybe she should start therapy, check in with her psychiatrist to adjust her meds, and even taking a small vacation to clear her mind. She politely brushed off my attempts to talk to her, stating that she is fine and just ""stressed out"". As time progressed, things continued to decline, and she started showing up for work extremely late, calling out, and neglected any and all responsibilities that landed on her plate. She also got into multiple car accidents within the last year, which led to the totaling of both her car and a car her parents had given her (after the first one was deemed totaled). 

Now for the situation that opened the can of worms; 
I just recently graduated with my bachelor's degree, and have been preparing to move into a career-related job. I submitted my notice almost two weeks ago. Friday of last week, I got a call from my dad about a family emergency that required my attention. I was supposed to open the store with Lisa the following morning, so I shot her a text to let her know I wouldn't be able to make it, and that I could pick up extra shifts my last week to accommodate so she could finally take an extra day off. Lisa is usually extremely easy to work with, and typically has no problems about switching shifts around for both me and Kelly. I figured this time would be no different, that Kelly would open the store instead, and I could take one of her upcoming shifts. However, the message I got back from Lisa was SCATHING, telling me in no uncertain terms that I could not call out and that I am making the scheduling tight and hurting the cafe. She also told me, ""You can text Kelly and ask her to pick up your shift, but I will not ask nor force her to do so"". This confused me, considering I always help out in scheduling, and I also didn't understand why Lisa all of a sudden refused to ask Kelly to help out. Admittedly, my response was driven by emotions, in which I said I would NOT be at work the following morning due to said family emergency and ""it is not my problem to ask Kelly, who is your girlfriend and assistant manager, to work with you instead"". Lisa texted back ""Kelly will cover"", and I didn't hear from either of them for the rest of the weekend.

The following Monday, I opened the cafe with Lisa. I approached her to try to smooth things over, but she interrupted me to tell me she wasn't the one behind the message - Kelly was. Apparently, I texted Lisa when they were at a friend's birthday party. She was drunk and dancing, saw the first bit of my call-out text, and handed the phone off to Kelly to ask me what was going on - which she did not do. Kelly instead pretended to be Lisa and said what she did. Lisa looked over to see Kelly furiously angry typing, took her phone back, read the exchange, and proceeded to get mad at Kelly for pretending to be her and saying all of those things. They had a bit of an argument, and Kelly said she would message me to apologize and tell me the truth - and then never did. 

Suffice to say, Lisa and I were both angry about what transpired. I decided to text Kelly later that evening to confront her. I let her know it was extremely inappropriate to impersonate someone, as well as say all the things she did about me hurting our schedule, especially considering she is the one that has been slacking off to an extreme measure and I have been the one to step up and help out Lisa. I admit, my tone with her was rather harsh, and my confrontation morphed into a not-so-calculated questionnaire about what was going on with her, why she is behaving this way, and why has she stopped taking care of everything in her life? While I awaited a response, she called out and left work early multiple days in order to avoid seeing me. 

Finally, after 2 days, she responded to me. She profusely apologized for the texting incident, stating that she was drunk and ""this is exactly why she isnt supposed to drink"". She expressed sadness over my leaving the cafe and not being able to work with me anymore, and also apologized for being so cruel in regards to me having a family emergency. She then dropped a bomb on me; she admitted that she is addicted to her prescription medications and overuses them (an SSRI antidepressant, a sedative anti-anxiety, and Adderall. She also smokes weed very heavily). She told me that Lisa knows of these issues but ""gets mad"" about her ""taking too much"", refuses to talk about it with her, and that she has no support system. We talked about rehab and outpatient options, and Kelly begged me to hold her accountable and bug her about getting help. I told her sure - I can hold her accountable, but the willpower to get sober ultimately has to come from her. I also advised her to be more transparent with Lisa, that she needed to be explicitly clear that she is addicted to these medications, abuses them, and needs help and support. Kelly said she would book an appointment and also have a sit-down conversation with Lisa to lay everything out on the table. 

Today, when I saw Lisa, I mentioned in casual conversation that I hope Kelly is doing okay and that their talk went well. She had absolutely no idea what I was talking about, expressed frustrations over Kelly still avoiding taking accountability for the texting incident with her, and pleaded will me to tell her what was going on. So.. I did, and I can see how I would be the AH here, but ultimately I just want Kelly to get help and wanted to do whatever it took for that to happen. To say Lisa was stunned would be an understatement. She told me that she, in fact, did not know about the medication abuse. Kelly would lie about not remembering to refill her prescriptions, when in reality she was just taking all of them way before she was able to refill. They would argue over this, with Lisa telling Kelly she needed to be more responsible in managing her refills, thinking she was just being irresponsible in that regard. She also told me about a LOT of other issues that I was not privy to that suddenly made a lot of sense. (I won't dive into that for privacy's sake - just know it consistent of multiple ""addict hitting rock bottom"" embarassing moments. iykyk.) Lisa was pacing the cafe, putting puzzle pieces together in her brain, and trying to figure out how to talk to Kelly after her shift. To avoid making it seem like we have been putting together some sort of weird intervention plot behind Kelly's back (and also to ensure she doesn't shut down and run away from the conversation), we decided I should shoot Kelly a text to let her know Lisa and I discussed things. That might not seem like the most logical step forward, but Lisa knew that Kelly would stonewall if she came home to dump a conversation on her without any warning. 

After I sent the text to give her a heads-up, Kelly starts texting Lisa, and I was unfortunately right there to read them. Kelly told Lisa that I was overreacting, am unable to stay out of her business, said I was on a vigilante quest to be ""savage"" (wtf does this even mean?) and said ""I knew I should have just ignored OPs text from the start, I am done talking to her, she needs to learn to butt-out"". Lisa and I stared at her phone like the shocked Pikachu meme. Just a day prior, Kelly was begging me to hold her accountable and pleading for a support system. Lisa left early to go talk to her (I assume they are still arguing as I type now), and I spent the remainder of my shift at the cafe stewing, ping-ponging between rage and immense sadness. 

After what Kelly said, a part of me does not want to continue our friendship for the time being. But I don't know where to draw my line at, and I am already feeling immense guilt over the prospect of cutting her off at a time when she clearly needs support. I know her words are likely just a symptom of her addiction - ive seen pill addictions before, and I know how not pretty they are. But I worry that if I don't cut her off now, we will reach a point of no return, and I will lose her forever. She is like my sister, and I just want her to get better, but I have absolutely no idea how to navigate this moving forward. So.. AITAH here? WIBTAH to cut ties with Kelly?

TLDR; my friend of 7 years is going through addiction and is starting to hit rock bottom, wibtah if I cut her off?

My husband hasn’t believed I’ve been sick and things all came to a head when I called my mum to come help me with the kids after my husband chucked a tantrum when I asked that he not go to the gym. 

Hubby was furious I’d called my mum for help and said it undermined him and made him look like he wasn’t supporting me. He said he’d take the next day off to look after the kids with his brother so I could sleep off my migraine and then get to the doctor.

I woke up and went downstairs to make a coffee to find our oldest (4) playing by herself, while hubby and his brother were measuring out the outdoor space to build a deck. I was pissed off because I realised that he hadn’t taken the day off to look after the kids, he’d taken it off to build a deck. 

Memory’s a bit blurry but let’s assume the worst and that I shouted at him for not recognizing that there was so many other things to do around the house (including looking after his children) than start a major project. 

He’s calling me controlling and saying we need to go to couple’s counseling. I’m fine with going to  counselling but am I truly the AH for asking him not to build a deck while I’m sick and he’s meant to be the primary carer?",98,1762051053.0,AmItheAsshole,57,0.94,False
1om68cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiebiz/comments/1om68cq/1200mo_to_1500mo_in_30_days_heres_the_exact_plan/,"$1,200/mo to $1,500/mo in 30 days. Here's the exact plan.","Last week I posted about hitting $1k/month for the first time. Didn't expect 100k+ people to read it.

The DMs I got were split into two camps. Half asking how I did it. The other half asking what's next.

So here's the plan for November. Not aspirational. Not some motivational vision board. The actual tactical plan to add $300 in MRR this month.

## Why $1,500 Is The Real Milestone

Everyone fixates on $10k/month like it's the only number that matters.

But $1,500 is different. That's the point where churn stops being existential.

At $1,200 with $29/month pricing, losing 2 customers in a week feels catastrophic. It's 5% of your revenue gone.

At $1,500 with 50+ customers, losing 2 customers is noise. You're stable enough to focus on growth instead of constantly firefighting retention.

## The Math

Current: 41 paying customers, $1,206 MRR

Target: 52 customers, $1,508 MRR

Need: 11 new customers in 30 days

Accounting for churn (historically 8% monthly): Need 14 signups to net 11

That's 3.5 signups per week. Tight but doable.

## What's NOT Changing

I'm not doing another Product Hunt launch. First one was a waste of time.

I'm not running paid ads. Tried that. Learned my lesson.

I'm not building features I think are cool. Only shipping what users actually request.

## What IS Changing

### 1. Double Down on Reddit

My last post got 100k impressions. I wrote it in 20 minutes while sitting in a coffee shop.

The ROI on authentic Reddit posts is insane compared to everything else I've tried. So I'm doing more of them.

Not promotional garbage. Actually useful posts that solve real problems. The kind where mentioning what I built feels natural, not forced.

Goal: 2 high value posts per week in r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS, or r/Startups

### 2. Add The One Feature Everyone Keeps Asking For

People love the Reddit research tools. Use them constantly.

But the number one request I get: ""Can this analyze competitor reviews on the App Store?""

I kept putting it off because it felt like scope creep. But when 12 different people ask for the exact same thing, that's not scope creep. That's product market fit trying to tell you something.

Shipping App Store review analysis by November 10th.

### 3. Fix The Biggest Churn Point

I lose most customers in week 2. They sign up, use the tool once, get value, then forget it exists.

The product doesn't have enough hooks to bring them back.

Solution: Weekly research digests. Every Monday, send users a summary of trending pain points in their target market. Make the product useful even when they're not actively validating an idea.

This isn't about engagement metrics. It's about making sure people remember the product exists when they need it.

### 4. Test a $99/Month Tier

Right now I have $29/month and $49/month plans.

But I have 3 customers who are clearly power users. They run 50+ queries per month, export everything, and actually read the market analysis reports.

They're getting way more value than $49/month. I should charge for it.

Adding a $99 tier with higher limits and priority support. Not expecting a flood of upgrades. But if even 2 of those power users upgrade, that's $100/month in pure profit.

## What Could Go Wrong

This plan assumes churn stays at 8%. If it spikes, I'm screwed.

It assumes Reddit doesn't randomly ban me for self promotion (it's happened before).

It assumes the App Store analysis feature actually works and people use it.

Plenty of ways this falls apart. But that's why the goal is $1,500 and not $5,000. It's ambitious but realistic.

## The Real Reason I'm Posting This

Accountability.

Every goal I've kept private, I've abandoned. Every goal I've made public, I've hit or come close.

So if you see me posting in December and I'm still at $1,200, you have full permission to roast me in the comments.

30 days. $300 in new MRR. Let's see if this works.

If you want to skip the manual research grind, check it out and also I ended up interviewing 100+ people for my current project over at [DevBox](https://bigideasdb.com) which saved me a lot of time and they were super helpful.

And if you're working on something similar, I'd genuinely be curious what your November goals look like. Not the LinkedIn version. The real numbers.

Scrawny sorrel gelding with a sway to his back and eyes like he’d seen some of the same storms I had. The first time I swung a leg over, he didn’t bolt, didn’t test me,  just stood there, still as prayer. Like he knew I wasn’t there to break him, and he sure as hell wasn’t there to be broken. They say horses don’t talk, but that’s a lie. They just don’t waste breath on bullshit. This one… he spoke in the way he'd shift his weight when my mind wandered too far off trail. In the soft blow through his nose when I’d wake up from a bad dream, fists clenched and jaw locked. Some nights, I’d walk out to the pen, sit on the fence, and he’d come stand by me like he was guarding what was left of my heart. I’ve spilled more sweat and blood than I care to count on the line, in the woods, under a sky that don’t always give a damn. But that horse? He gave a damn. Every damn day. He carried more than gear and tack. He carried my silence, my grief, the guilt I never knew how to unload. And he never once buckled. There’s something sacred about an animal that’ll let you put your pain in their hands... hell, their hooves and carry it without question. He never judged the days I rode quiet or the mornings I drank coffee like it was penance. He just kept walking forward, steady as time. That horse didn’t save my life in the big, dramatic way folks like to write songs about. No hero moment. No blaze of glory. He just stayed. He listened. And little by little, he reached into my soul, pulled out what was still good, and patched up what was cracked. I owe that horse more than oats and water. I owe him the man I became after I found my footing again. By FirefightingCowboy

1om637s,https://i.redd.it/6386yxlw6ryf1.png,The Closest Thing We Have to Magic Right Now,"Stephan King said, “Books are a uniquely portable magic.” To read is to voyage through time. Someone dead for thousands of years can speak to you through writing.

But I’m not talking about metaphors. I’m talking about the supernatural. Real magic. Let me prove it:

* I was born on June 14, 1985 and went to Catholic school in Canada.
* In grade 8, I played Jesus at the school play. It was between me and a girl. We picked straws and I won.
* My childhood Master gifted me a black belt, it was found in his storage unit after he passed away.
* I once met a theologian at a coffee shop. He received a PhD in Old Testament studies and included me in his dissertation.
* Kanye and I both released “The Key to Life” on the same day. His song and my book. The odds of that happening is one in millions.
* I announced Chicago as the first US city on my book tour.
* Chicago’s Robert Francis Prevost was named Pope Leo the XIV on May 8, 2025.

In summary, I played Jesus. Black belt from dying master. Kanye and I are on the same wavelength. Pope Leo the 14th on 5/8 and my birthdate.

I’m claiming magic, because these are numbers and numbers don’t lie.

On the validity of my Black Belt: For honor, for truth and for life, I will use this dying gift to make you proud.

Mainly looking for feedback on the overall route / timing, but thoughts on specific daily activities are appreciated. I'm seeing South Island after the grad program, so just focusing on North Island for now. I'm aware it's peak season.

Main goal is to see as much as possible since I'm likely only doing this once in my life, so I'm ok with more driving / shorter times in each place. Not a huge foodie (looking forward to trying Whittaker's though) and I don't like wine.

I'm not a heavy hiker or adrenaline rush person; more of a 1-2 hour ""nature walk"" person. One remaining question is whether Waitomo is worth it - seems there's other (free) glowworm caves, though perhaps the walk or rafting could be good? I am willing to splurge a bit for activities but don't want to be wasteful. Thank you all!

My collection feels really well-rounded to me right now, but I've been more interested in exploring sweet scents and vanillas lately, and I'd love some new suggestions.

I'm a floral lover at heart and my taste tends toward fresh florals. I love rose, and I love white florals, but if I get a whiff of the bad breath variety of indole in a fragrance it's game over for me. I'm picky about amber as sometimes it smells musty on my skin. I'm not opposed to woody or spicy notes as a concept, but some of the woody aromachemicals smell so sharp to me that they make me feel like my nose is burning.

I've noticed that I tend to get along with almond, anise, and coffee reasonably well in sweeter fragrances, and would love any recs in that category. Hypnotic Poison was ultimately a miss for me as I got the band-aid dry down.

Rose is my favorite note and I would also love any novel suggestions for a sweet, syrupy rose, similar to Kayali Fleur Majesty Rose Royale which I really enjoy. The cedar in Delina bothers me, Lush Rose Jam was too sour, Atomic Rose was too synthetic, Very Good Girl was close but smelled like cough syrup to me in the opening. I used to wear Montale Intense Cafe but it smells synthetic to me now. I may try Delina Exclusif again sometime.

Many of us live in Worcester County, and I saw today that the Worcester County Food Bank (WCFB) sent a call out to the community that they are in short supply for the needs of the county. If you are able, please join me and consider donating food and essentials to your nearest food bank.

The WCFB gets preferential bulk ordering discounts, so that every $1 received is worth $4 of donated food. Even sending them $5 is very much worth it. Instead of giving my money to big corps during the fall/winter, like coffee from Starbucks, I will be instead send the money over to WCFB.

We hit the rock gym a few times a week. We run errands together. We walk our dog and hike together. We watch things together.

But there’s something great about existing in the same space not needing to actively interact. A lot of the afternoon was that. We had a coffee and shopping morning and then came home where I’ve spent most of the day watching sports while she needlepoints and listens to an audiobook.

Sometimes she checks in with what I’m watching and we talk for awhile. Or she shows me her project and I get to compliment her amazing work.

But we can be lazy on the couch together and just veg out both doing something we enjoy.",2,1762049903.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I did a ☕️ coffee based logo design. Recently, I played with an old design file and cameup with this logomark. 2 letter ""B""s merged together with coffee bean's curved line in the middle creates the perfect logo for according to the title name.
