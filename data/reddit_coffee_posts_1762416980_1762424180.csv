1opv50w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1opv50w/my_29f_husbands_33m_financial_risk_tolerance_is/,My (29F) husband's (33M) financial risk tolerance is incompatible with mine. Divorce?,"Ill try to summarize this objectively.

Husband and I have been together for 10 years. We married in the courthouse this spring right before I had my son and had been engaged for 4 years.

Husband started a business 2 years ago and quit his job to work the business full time one year ago.

So he quit his job right around the time I found out i was pregnant.

Leading up to having the child was rough. We had couples therapy due to financial disagreements.

I make a little over 100k and have no problem being the breadwinner, its often been the other way around in our relationship until the past few years when i busted my ass and hustled to improve. (So I get the grind and was very supportive of husbands business! At first.)

But not knowing what income I can expect from him, and having him outright refuse to put a timeline or numbers on his business so we can plan accordingly is killing me.

Now the babe is here, we are barely scraping by and absolutely cannot afford daycare. I made it clear during my pregnancy I could not watch him while working. Well, I work remote and end up watching him several times a week for an hour or two or three while he goes out for work meetings or coffees. My company has returned to in office work and I am waiting for a seat to open for me which could happen any day, then I will be full time in office an hour away...

I dont want him to quit.... I want him to say if im not making X by Y then I need to do XYZ. But whenever I talk about something like this, he shuts down. Its like he feels any criticism of the business is a criticism of him and goes on the major defense mode instead of the listening husband mode.

Of course I wish I had more support as my job stopped paying me when I was on my very short maternity leave. My family had to step up for our finances because my husband couldn't.  He was working every day i was in the hospital. He was there with me, but laptop open, and had to step out multiple times sometimes for hours.

Much of his extra time and money goes to the business. He is heavily involved in the community. We cant go anywhere without him being recognized.

Everyone loves him, I feel some type of resentment for that too. He volunteers a lot and helps out people around town meanwhile im home caring for the baby, and paying the bills, bearing the brunt of the financial stress. A recent prominant example of this would be the other day we took baby to a free swim class and teacher was like ""Husbands Name and his Baby are here!"" I quickly said ""and his wife!"" And she stumbled and said ""oh yes haha!""

We moved here not knowing anyone three years ago. He is well connected now. I have friends and have started my own communities but let them mostly drop once my son arrived. Im rebuilding them now as I am able.

In his defense here, he watches the baby too, he takes the baby with him places, and ""watches"" him during the workday which unfortunately involves him being propped in a chair with a bottle or laid down on the mat or propped in front of a TV while he works. Its not ideal.

The other day I really tried to sit down and explain how desperate I feel financially. I said ""I have lost respect for you as a partner through all of this"" and he snapped and said ""ive lost respect for you too."" It felt as if he was trying to hurt me as I had hurt him, meanwhile I was trying to convey my desperation.

It just feels petty and childish. And its getting worse. I said I love my son's father. I love the part of you that is my best friend. But I want to divorce the man that owns this business. He seemed incredulous. Scoffing, asking why. The conversations turn to arguments which lately have become yelling matches which becomes icey silence. Unacceptable for my son to be around.

I know i am the bad guy in his eyes. I am unsupportive, I just need to ""sacrifice a couple hundred bucks a month"" he said in a rage. But I have said ""your lemonade stand is killing our family""  in a rage.

Im not perfect. I cry and swear when the conversations get angry. This is my one sided description of events. I love him. We have many great years but this business has blinded him. His ego is killing our marriage, in my opinion.

Does anyone have sage advice? Can someone tell me I leave his ass I know it wont be my biggest regret of my life considering all the good against this recent streak of bad? I need help.",1,1762423898.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1opv27h,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1opv27h/i_confessed_and_asked_a_shy_guy_out_thrice_please/,I confessed and asked a shy guy out — thrice.. please help!,"Problem/Goal: I don’t know what to do. Should I initiate another date with this shy guy I like? Or should I stop? Is he interested with me or not? I mean shouldn’t he do something too? I’m just so confused.

This mind games is really messing up with me. Please help me.. 

CONTEXT: 

I (F33) am an extrovert (aquarius) but introvert romantically. 😅 I’m NBSB (No Boyfriend Since Birth), never had any romantic relationship with the opposite sex, never been on a date, doesn’t know how to flirt, I’m really a late bloomer (please don’t judge, that’s just who I am).

This guy (M30) is shy, introvert (scorpio), never had a girlfriend but had an ‘almost girlfriend’ last year that didn’t work out (his law school classmate), never been kissed, still a virgin, a working student (working and studying law at the same time / now on his 4th year)..

This is gonne be a really long story but I really need help, especially due to my lack of experience with guys.. 🥹🥲 

We’re from the same town, knew each other from childhood though never the same circle of friends. Also, I don’t know if this will matter but my family is a little well off in our town, and his was kinda not (that’s why I like him, their economic situation never hindered him from graduating and going after his dreams). We also belong to the same organization where I get to know him on a deeper level and realized how great of a human being he is. That’s when I started to like him.

I really like him. And with him, I felt safe to make the first move.. so that could be why I was able to confess to him, thrice. 

The first time, I did it in person.. I was too nervous, but I still gathered the guts to spill how I feel. He was so shocked because never had I showed him interest (I’m that type of girl who’s very friendly but who also knows nothing about flirting). I’m just too shy to be vulnerable with my heart to be honest.

He didn’t answer me back about how he felt.. the only answer he gave me was he was thinking it’s improper since we are kinda distant relatives (though my grandma was only adapted so not really by blood) and we live in a close knitted community, so he was worried it could cause people to talk or something..

His reaction caused me to wall up.. I took that rejection a little personal, so weeks later, I kinda showed him I’ve moved on and opened myself to hanging out with other guys (I know a little immature but I didn’t know how to handle it so 🥲).. 

And then that’s when, I started to notice his behavior changed.. He started to become active on our group chats, and everytime our organizatin has a get together or hanging out, he kept replaying songs like I’d Rather (lyrics is kinda about regrets), Muli (it’s about asking for a second chance), Sigaw ng Puso (about not minding what othe people think), and other songs that revolve around those themes.

These really got me so confused.. I don’t know if I was just being selective, if my mind were just playing tricks on me, but somehow, that gave me another courage to chat him again about how I feel..

This second confession, he reacted ‘heart’ on Messenger but didn’t respond. Though after a month, when we had a get together again where some of my family were present, I noticed he kept looking at me and tried to get near me. This time, I was the one who panicked and kept our distance. I was worried because some of my relatives were present and my nervousness got the best of me. I was just so confused why he never responded to my chat when it was just us, and now, he was doing this in front of people.

My 3rd confession was through chat again. This time, I had an upcoming 2 week travel, so I gathered the guts to not only confess but to also ASK HIM OUT before I leave.

I was so nervous of his answer because what if he rejects me? But holla, he said yes, he had exams but right after, we can meet. In the same chat, I also told him to keep it secret, like only for the two of us. He ‘reacted like’ on that chat and replied ‘No problem’ then I explained because I’m also afraid of what people will say. He’d just seen that message, and no response (well maybe because it’s his exam week so he was really busy).

We set a date the day before my fight which was also the last day of exams.

Then, when the day of our date came, we had dinner. It was the first time I had a date to be honest, Loool. And it was fun. I was soo embarassed at first, but I managed. He’s not the kind of person who judges so I felt safe. When I asked him about how he felt after reading my message of asking him out, he said he liked my courage. He wasn’t disappointed at all no see me as desperate or player. We talked a lot about lots of things.. I got to know him a little better.

Then right after, I asked him if we can meet again the next morning, this time for coffee and church (since it’s Sunday and my flight is in the afternoon), we met in the morning. We talked and I told him the reasons why I liked him. He just listened and talked but really never told me how he felt. We went separate ways with me feeling nice about it.

Our third date, I initiated once again, just right after I arrived from my travel. He said yes, and then we did. We had fun, but this time, all we talked about were safe topics (school etc), like never anything about us or about feelings or what we are. Also, no physical touch or something. I was too shy to initiate one and I don’t know if it’s the same with him. He didn’t ask me out nor told me how he felt.

We also don’t chat. I mean I initiate sometimes, he responds and then it doesn’y go really further because after some replies, he usually finishes the convo by reacting ‘heart’ to my reply and then that’s it. It becomes my sign that maybe he doesn’t want the chat to go further. This kinda hits my pride so I just leave it be. 

Also he doesn’t initiate any chat at all, nor initiate any dates. I’m not sure if it’s because he’s really busy with school / work, and doesn’t want to be distracted (he’s an achiever talaga), or if he’s just not really into me, or because he’s just shy (but he already knows how I feel so I think this is moot), or is he still hung up with his almost girlfriend he had from last year, or is he into me but just not enough to take this further?

I’m considering asking him upfront but with all the efforst I already did, I’m not sure if I can summon another courage to be upfront this time.

1opuze8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1opuze8/has_anyone_else_ever_seen_the_shadows_coming_down/,Has anyone else ever seen the shadows coming down from the ceiling?,"Before I start, here are a few important details to set the context:

* My boyfriend usually sleeps very lightly and wakes up easily if I turn on the light or even just get up to pee.  
* It must have been late September, so it was still warm outside, not cold enough for your breath to fog up.  
* I’m usually down-to-earth, even if this experience slightly changed my perspective.  
* On my bedside table next to me, there was a small, very classic night lamp with a lampshade open at the top, which meant that when I turned it on, a circle of light would normally appear on the ceiling.  
* My mother is somewhat connected to the paranormal: she’s a bit of a witch, she uses a pendulum, and she’s a fire cutter (a kind of energy healer).  





It was autumn 2021. I was living in a small ground-floor apartment with my boyfriend. It was a tiny building at the back of a courtyard, with only one other apartment of the same layout above us. We had a bedroom separated from the living area but attached to it. I loved that apartment; I found it really healthy, pleasant, bright, and we were very happy there.

I had been coughing for a while and was a bit sick, which prevented me from sleeping and bothered my partner, who is a very light sleeper. Because of that, he had gotten used to finishing his night on the couch for a few days when my coughing bothered him too much.

One evening, I couldn’t sleep and was coughing more than usual. My boyfriend was sleeping next to me, and for once, he didn’t seem to wake up. I hadn’t fallen asleep, too disturbed by my cough, and as time passed, I was coughing more and more — and I also felt a strange kind of anxiety rising in me that I couldn’t explain. Pushed by all that, I decided to turn on the light.

Right away, I had a strange feeling, as if something was wrong. At first, I thought it was because it didn’t seem to bother my partner, even though usually both the light and the noise I made would have woken him 100%. Then I noticed that it was darker than usual when the light was on.

I looked up and realized that the ceiling was in shadow. Instantly, a feeling of terror came over me and I froze, staring at the ceiling. I shook my partner a little, but not very strongly, and he kept sleeping.

I kept my eyes fixed on the ceiling, which was in shadow, without the usual yellow circle of my bedside lamp, when, like thick streaks of paint, the shadows suddenly started to slowly slide down from the ceiling onto the walls.

It terrified me so much that it gave me the push I needed to move — I got up, grabbed my phone, terrified at the idea of staying in the room with those strange shadows. I left the light on and my boyfriend in bed. He still didn’t wake up.

I went into the living room, which was next to the bedroom, and turned on the ceiling light. The light was bright, just a bare bulb on the ceiling without a lampshade. The ceiling lit up normally, and I sat down on the couch, terrified, watching the ceiling.

A few minutes later, I saw the shadows passing through the wall that separated the bedroom from the living room, spreading again over the ceiling.

By instinct, I called my mother on WhatsApp video. It was around 2 a.m. My mother answered before the first ring even finished. I didn’t even have time to say anything before she said: “I dreamed that the shadows were coming down from your ceiling.”

I then turned the camera and showed her the shadows moving on the ceiling and slowly approaching the bulb. I told her I felt really bad, that I was terrified, and she went to get her pendulum. That evening, my boyfriend and I had watched a movie while eating popcorn, and the bowl was still on the coffee table.

I don’t really know what she was doing with her pendulum from a distance, but I started to feel very sick — coughing harder and harder, feeling nauseous. I kept watching the shadows, which seemed to have stopped moving. Suddenly, I felt really unwell, grabbed the bowl, and vomited into it.

Except it wasn’t vomit — it was some kind of ectoplasm, like half a liter of clear mucus. Disgusting.

I was even more frightened seeing what had come out of me. When the episode was over, I turned the camera and showed my mother the contents of the bowl.

She told me to get rid of it right away, to throw it in the toilet and flush it well, then wash the bowl thoroughly. I did exactly that.

When I came back to the living room, I felt calmer, and when I looked up, there were no strange, abnormal shadows anymore.

I talked a bit with my mother, trying to understand what had just happened without finding a satisfying explanation, then, since we were both exhausted, we hung up and went to bed.

Except I didn’t dare go back into the bedroom, so I settled on the couch with the light on. My boyfriend slept the whole night without waking up once, even though the light stayed on all night.

The next morning, when I got to work, I hadn’t slept at all. I told two close colleagues what had happened. One is very religious (Catholic), the other practices reiki and shamanism. They offered to come home with me after work to see what they could do.

I don’t really believe in either, but I was so shaken by the previous night that I was ready to try anything.

When we got to my place, it was still daylight, very nice weather and warm. We weren’t wearing our coats, for instance. We decided to open all the windows in the apartment, and my two friends started saying they didn’t feel good in the bedroom (I stayed outside in the courtyard because I was too scared to go in).

The Catholic one knelt by my bed and started praying — she recited an exorcism prayer (Saint Michael’s, I think) — while the other walked around the apartment burning sage.

I was outside, and both the living room and bedroom windows opened onto the courtyard, so I could see my praying friend’s breath forming mist. She stopped, looked at me, said she noticed it too, and told me it was colder in the bedroom now.

My other friend was in the living room. She took out her pendulum and started asking questions aloud, with a book in her hand that she used as a guide.

The whole thing went on for quite a while until they both felt satisfied. The mist disappeared, the temperature in the apartment rose again, and they both felt calmer. So I went back inside, and I did feel a difference.

I can’t really explain it, but it was as if an invisible weight that had been pressing on the apartment had lifted.

My Catholic friend had to go home, and my more New Age friend stayed a bit to keep me company until my boyfriend returned from work. I should note that this person had never been to my apartment before.

She asked me a few questions about my upstairs neighbor, whom I barely knew. I knew her first and last name and had met her a few times in the courtyard. We had chatted a little, but that was it. A few weeks earlier, my boyfriend and I had called our landlord to ask if he’d heard from her and if she was okay, since we hadn’t heard a sound upstairs and were starting to worry. He told us that she was in a deep depression and had been institutionalized for several months, so we shouldn’t worry if we didn’t hear or see her anymore.

I hadn’t told my friends about this, especially my coworkers whom I wasn’t very close to, because it was just a minor detail in my life.

Then my friend asked me if my neighbor’s first name was “MXXXXXXE.” I told her yes (the mailboxes in the hallway only showed last names). She started describing her appearance, and she got it mostly right. She asked if my neighbor was okay, if she was depressed. I told her yes, but that she hadn’t lived there for weeks. She asked if the apartment was still in her name and if her belongings were still there. I told her that as far as I knew, yes.

My friend then explained that, according to her and her pendulum, my neighbor was so unhappy that her sadness had imprinted itself on the apartment above, and since she was still emotionally attached to the place, she had created an entity that I had sensed because I was physically weak — sick and very tired — which allowed it to enter my home. She said she had now protected my place and that I should be safe.

Since then, nothing strange has happened again, and when I moved out a few years later, I found little bottles and pentacles hidden near the windows, as well as a small prayer rosary and a copy of a protection prayer under the foot of my bed — gifts from my friends.

I still don’t know what happened that night.  
But I will never forget the feeling I had when the shadows started coming down from the ceiling.

Has anyone else ever experienced something similar?

1opuz30,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1opuz30/mothers_fight_for_medical_cannabis_for_son_with/,Mother's fight for medical cannabis for son with epilepsy continues,"Kyler Reed was just six years old when his seizures began, prompting his mother, Marcie Reed, to advocate for the legalization of medical cannabis. ""I remember I belonged to a coffee group and I had told them that if there was ever a petition for medical cannabis, I would pass it,"" she said.

Kyler, now 12, takes traditional medicine for both epilepsy and ADHD, which includes multiple medications. ""His seizures are, knock on wood, controlled by his meds right now, but I always tell them, he takes too many meds,"" Marcie said. Kyler himself expressed his desire for an alternative, saying, ""I want medical cannabis because I don’t want to take six medicines every single day.""

At a Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission meeting, Marcie highlighted the potential side effects of Kyler's current medications, which include risks to body organs, deadly reactions, and heart-related problems. She noted the concerns some have about cannabis, but countered, ""I did have a guy when I was having people sign the petition ask me ‘well what happens if when he gets older he decides he likes the medical cannabis a little bit too much?’ and I said ‘well what do I do if he grows up and likes his focalin a little too much?’""

Despite Kyler being seizure-free for almost two years, Marcie remains vigilant. ""It seems like every time the school calls me, I still have that sinking feeling,"" she said. She is cautious about the form of cannabis they would use, stating, ""I would not give her 12-year-old a vape or joint and they would look for an oil to use.""

Marcie expressed frustration with the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission meetings, feeling that they are not listening to her concerns. ""They’ve never lived our lives,"" she said, pointing out the challenges of accessing medication in their small town.

  
As she considers Kyler's future, Marcie worries about his quality of life and independence. ""I do worry about him every day. Is he going to be able to drive?"" she said. Adjustments have been made to accommodate Kyler's needs, such as planning vacations around his medication schedule.

Reflecting on her journey, Marcie often wonders why she was given a child with such needs. A friend once told her it was because ""God knew she would fight for him.""

1opuyoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLifeUSA/comments/1opuyoo/which_kind_of_laptop_is_better_for_a_student/,Which Kind of Laptop Is Better for a Student? Reddit 2025 -Real Advice from Everyday Users,"Buying a laptop for school shouldn’t feel like decoding a spec sheet -yet every year, students get stuck between flashy marketing and real-world practicality. That’s why people search **“Which kind of laptop is better for a student Reddit”** \-to hear what *actual students and tech users* recommend, not just sales reps.

Whether you’re in high school, college, or grad school, your laptop is more than a study tool -it’s your daily workspace, research hub, and sometimes, your only entertainment device. This post breaks down what Reddit users, IT experts, and long-term students agree on: **how to choose the right laptop that balances price, performance, and durability.**

# Prioritize Portability and Battery Life

Students spend hours moving between classes, libraries, and cafés. Reddit threads repeatedly highlight **weight and battery** as the most important features.

Aim for:  
• Under **3.5 lbs (1.6 kg)** weight  
• **10+ hours** of real battery life  
• USB-C charging for convenience

Reddit-tested examples: MacBook Air, ASUS Zenbook, and Lenovo ThinkPad series -all known for lightweight builds and strong endurance.

# Choose Specs That Match Your Major

A journalism student doesn’t need the same setup as an engineering major. Reddit communities emphasize aligning **power with purpose**:

For general use (notes, browsing, papers):  
• Intel i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 / Apple M2  
• 8GB RAM minimum  
• 256GB SSD

For design, coding, or engineering:  
• Intel i7 / Ryzen 7 / Apple M3  
• 16GB RAM or higher  
• Dedicated GPU (optional but helpful)

Buying “too powerful” can drain your budget and battery -balance specs with what you’ll actually use.

# Durability Matters More Than You Think

A student laptop isn’t just about speed -it’s about **surviving semesters of wear, backpacks, and coffee spills.**

Reddit’s most recommended laptops (MacBook, ThinkPad, Dell Latitude, ASUS Zenbook) share one trait: solid chassis design and proven longevity.  
Look for:  
• Aluminum or magnesium build  
• Spill-resistant keyboard  
• Good repairability or long warranty

Durability means your laptop still runs smoothly when you graduate -not just through the first semester.

# Focus on Display & Comfort

You’ll stare at that screen for 6+ hours a day. Don’t underestimate comfort.

Key things Redditors mention:  
• IPS or OLED display for eye comfort  
• Anti-glare coating for classroom lights  
• 13–14"" screen for best portability  
• Responsive keyboard & large touchpad

A bright, clear display and comfortable typing experience often matter more than extra power.

# Operating System: macOS vs. Windows vs. Chromebook

Each has pros and tradeoffs:

 **macOS:** Reliable, long battery, premium build -ideal for creative fields, note-taking, and multitasking.  
 **Windows:** Flexible, great for STEM, gaming, and software compatibility.  
**Chromebook:** Lightweight, secure, budget-friendly -best for writing, browsing, and cloud use.

Reddit consensus:  
→ macOS = long-term investment  
→ Windows = balance of power and price  
→ Chromebook = affordable simplicity

# Reddit FAQ: Student Laptop Buying

* **How much should a student spend on a laptop?**
   * Between $600–$1,200 covers most needs. Spend more only if your major requires design or 3D software.
* **Are gaming laptops good for students?** 
   * They’re powerful but heavy, noisy, and have shorter battery life. Only worth it if you game often or need GPU performance for class projects.
* **Can a Chromebook handle college work?** 
   * Yes, for light majors (writing, business, communications). For software-heavy majors, go Windows or macOS.
* **Should students buy refurbished laptops?** 
   * Absolutely -Reddit users often report excellent results buying certified refurbished Macs, Dells, and HPs with warranties intact.
* **Is Apple worth the extra cost?**
   *  If you value battery life, design, and long-term OS support -yes. Otherwise, mid-range Windows ultrabooks give 90% of the experience for less.

The best student laptop isn’t the most expensive -it’s the one that keeps up with your studies, lasts through college, and doesn’t make you hunt for outlets every three hours.",1,1762423254.0,BuyItForLifeUSA,0,1.0,False
1opuw6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1opuw6p/has_anyone_else_ever_seen_the_shadows_coming_down/,Has anyone else ever seen the shadows coming down from the ceiling?,"Before I start, here are a few important details to set the context:

* My boyfriend usually sleeps very lightly and wakes up easily if I turn on the light or even just get up to pee.  
* It must have been late September, so it was still warm outside, not cold enough for your breath to fog up.  
* I’m usually down-to-earth, even if this experience slightly changed my perspective.  
* On my bedside table next to me, there was a small, very classic night lamp with a lampshade open at the top, which meant that when I turned it on, a circle of light would normally appear on the ceiling.  
* My mother is somewhat connected to the paranormal: she’s a bit of a witch, she uses a pendulum, and she’s a fire cutter (a kind of energy healer).  





It was autumn 2021. I was living in a small ground-floor apartment with my boyfriend. It was a tiny building at the back of a courtyard, with only one other apartment of the same layout above us. We had a bedroom separated from the living area but attached to it. I loved that apartment; I found it really healthy, pleasant, bright, and we were very happy there.

I had been coughing for a while and was a bit sick, which prevented me from sleeping and bothered my partner, who is a very light sleeper. Because of that, he had gotten used to finishing his night on the couch for a few days when my coughing bothered him too much.

One evening, I couldn’t sleep and was coughing more than usual. My boyfriend was sleeping next to me, and for once, he didn’t seem to wake up. I hadn’t fallen asleep, too disturbed by my cough, and as time passed, I was coughing more and more — and I also felt a strange kind of anxiety rising in me that I couldn’t explain. Pushed by all that, I decided to turn on the light.

Right away, I had a strange feeling, as if something was wrong. At first, I thought it was because it didn’t seem to bother my partner, even though usually both the light and the noise I made would have woken him 100%. Then I noticed that it was darker than usual when the light was on.

I looked up and realized that the ceiling was in shadow. Instantly, a feeling of terror came over me and I froze, staring at the ceiling. I shook my partner a little, but not very strongly, and he kept sleeping.

I kept my eyes fixed on the ceiling, which was in shadow, without the usual yellow circle of my bedside lamp, when, like thick streaks of paint, the shadows suddenly started to slowly slide down from the ceiling onto the walls.

It terrified me so much that it gave me the push I needed to move — I got up, grabbed my phone, terrified at the idea of staying in the room with those strange shadows. I left the light on and my boyfriend in bed. He still didn’t wake up.

I went into the living room, which was next to the bedroom, and turned on the ceiling light. The light was bright, just a bare bulb on the ceiling without a lampshade. The ceiling lit up normally, and I sat down on the couch, terrified, watching the ceiling.

A few minutes later, I saw the shadows passing through the wall that separated the bedroom from the living room, spreading again over the ceiling.

By instinct, I called my mother on WhatsApp video. It was around 2 a.m. My mother answered before the first ring even finished. I didn’t even have time to say anything before she said: “I dreamed that the shadows were coming down from your ceiling.”

I then turned the camera and showed her the shadows moving on the ceiling and slowly approaching the bulb. I told her I felt really bad, that I was terrified, and she went to get her pendulum. That evening, my boyfriend and I had watched a movie while eating popcorn, and the bowl was still on the coffee table.

I don’t really know what she was doing with her pendulum from a distance, but I started to feel very sick — coughing harder and harder, feeling nauseous. I kept watching the shadows, which seemed to have stopped moving. Suddenly, I felt really unwell, grabbed the bowl, and vomited into it.

Except it wasn’t vomit — it was some kind of ectoplasm, like half a liter of clear mucus. Disgusting.

I was even more frightened seeing what had come out of me. When the episode was over, I turned the camera and showed my mother the contents of the bowl.

She told me to get rid of it right away, to throw it in the toilet and flush it well, then wash the bowl thoroughly. I did exactly that.

When I came back to the living room, I felt calmer, and when I looked up, there were no strange, abnormal shadows anymore.

I talked a bit with my mother, trying to understand what had just happened without finding a satisfying explanation, then, since we were both exhausted, we hung up and went to bed.

Except I didn’t dare go back into the bedroom, so I settled on the couch with the light on. My boyfriend slept the whole night without waking up once, even though the light stayed on all night.

The next morning, when I got to work, I hadn’t slept at all. I told two close colleagues what had happened. One is very religious (Catholic), the other practices reiki and shamanism. They offered to come home with me after work to see what they could do.

I don’t really believe in either, but I was so shaken by the previous night that I was ready to try anything.

When we got to my place, it was still daylight, very nice weather and warm. We weren’t wearing our coats, for instance. We decided to open all the windows in the apartment, and my two friends started saying they didn’t feel good in the bedroom (I stayed outside in the courtyard because I was too scared to go in).

The Catholic one knelt by my bed and started praying — she recited an exorcism prayer (Saint Michael’s, I think) — while the other walked around the apartment burning sage.

I was outside, and both the living room and bedroom windows opened onto the courtyard, so I could see my praying friend’s breath forming mist. She stopped, looked at me, said she noticed it too, and told me it was colder in the bedroom now.

My other friend was in the living room. She took out her pendulum and started asking questions aloud, with a book in her hand that she used as a guide.

The whole thing went on for quite a while until they both felt satisfied. The mist disappeared, the temperature in the apartment rose again, and they both felt calmer. So I went back inside, and I did feel a difference.

I can’t really explain it, but it was as if an invisible weight that had been pressing on the apartment had lifted.

My Catholic friend had to go home, and my more New Age friend stayed a bit to keep me company until my boyfriend returned from work. I should note that this person had never been to my apartment before.

She asked me a few questions about my upstairs neighbor, whom I barely knew. I knew her first and last name and had met her a few times in the courtyard. We had chatted a little, but that was it. A few weeks earlier, my boyfriend and I had called our landlord to ask if he’d heard from her and if she was okay, since we hadn’t heard a sound upstairs and were starting to worry. He told us that she was in a deep depression and had been institutionalized for several months, so we shouldn’t worry if we didn’t hear or see her anymore.

I hadn’t told my friends about this, especially my coworkers whom I wasn’t very close to, because it was just a minor detail in my life.

Then my friend asked me if my neighbor’s first name was “MXXXXXXE.” I told her yes (the mailboxes in the hallway only showed last names). She started describing her appearance, and she got it mostly right. She asked if my neighbor was okay, if she was depressed. I told her yes, but that she hadn’t lived there for weeks. She asked if the apartment was still in her name and if her belongings were still there. I told her that as far as I knew, yes.

My friend then explained that, according to her and her pendulum, my neighbor was so unhappy that her sadness had imprinted itself on the apartment above, and since she was still emotionally attached to the place, she had created an entity that I had sensed because I was physically weak — sick and very tired — which allowed it to enter my home. She said she had now protected my place and that I should be safe.

Since then, nothing strange has happened again, and when I moved out a few years later, I found little bottles and pentacles hidden near the windows, as well as a small prayer rosary and a copy of a protection prayer under the foot of my bed — gifts from my friends.

I still don’t know what happened that night.  
But I will never forget the feeling I had when the shadows started coming down from the ceiling.

Has anyone else ever experienced something similar?

I still remember walking through the UNSW Quadrangle on my first day, surrounded by students from all over the world, feeling both nervous and excited.

The first few weeks were challenging as I adjusted to university life and independence, but UNSW quickly became more than just a place to study. The professors were supportive, the campus was beautiful, and the energy of the community made me feel part of something bigger.

I made friends from different backgrounds, joined student societies, and found comfort in small moments like late-night study sessions and coffee breaks between classes. Over time, I learned not just about my degree, but about resilience, confidence, and self-growth.

UNSW has truly been an amazing chapter in my life, a place that taught me how to stand on my own, think deeply, and embrace the world with an open mind.

p.s I knew chinese men were skinny but surprised I have that much bigger muscles than them haha but I have loved their company from the Australian born chinese and International ones.

1opuqta,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1opuqta/had_to_cut_ties_with_my_mom/,Had to Cut Ties With My Mom…,"I (31 F) recently went to visit my mom in my home town (I live a 5 hour plane flight away) and it made me finally notice so many toxic behaviours that I never connected before. It was the final push I needed to leave the relationship. However, I feel like I’m drowning in guilt, depression, anxiety, and even regret I suppose. I’m sorry this is so long, I really don’t have many friends and I don’t want to start drama with my family so I’m just suffering mostly alone (I do have a partner that loves me a lot but that’s kind of it)

I’m currently finishing my BA in Psychology. I’ve written an original paper that I’m presenting at a conference, and will be publishing. I’ve got a 3.95 GPA and I’m working on another paper with my professor - I’m going to be going into Clinical Psychology. I’m not trying brag I just want to point out how important this is to me to give a bit of context for my trip. My friend came with me because he’d never been to my home town and it’s a tourist spot.

The first 2 days were fine, fun even.

Day 3 it started going downhill in small ways (I asked my mom what my paper was about and she got it wrong using really specific words - I didn’t make a big deal. I corrected her, and used an example that was personal to her, thinking that would help her remember).

Day 4, she started triangulation (telling stories about my little brother, but I was very firm that I didn’t want to talk about it), ignored my carved pumpkins (god it sounds so freaking stupid but I spend HOURS on them and she didn’t even take a picture… but she took pictures of everything else on Halloween), asked me to go inside when kids liked my costume better than hers, ignored/walked away from me when I asked if she wanted me to order pizza, and when I asked if anyone wanted to see the experiment I programmed from scratch my mom said ‘oh the one you mentioned where people get paid 7$?’ ‘Yeah!’ and then she just walked away without responding and went to watch tv.

Day 5 I went to visit an estranged paternal aunt for a few hours and when I came home the energy was weird in the house. My stepbrother was visiting because I hadn’t been home in awhile. He has a band and I was trying to celebrate him (the way I wasn’t being celebrated) by playing his song on Spotify and singing along to show I knew the lyrics. I got exactly 57 seconds into his song when my mom whispers to my little brother and then turns to me with a subtle smile saying ‘WE figured out what’s wrong with you: you shake your head too much and all of your brain cells fell out and died.’ It hurt, sure, but I tried to downplay it and just said ‘well I’m going to be a Dr, so I can’t be that dumb’ and she goes ‘well we will have to see about that…’ and I still didn’t get upset. I just tried to move on, but everything I said she had a negative mean thing to say (I’ll have a shitty house, I’ll choose bad vacation spots, I won’t even be able to afford anything in the end). Finally she says something like ‘well we will go to Caribbean and you won’t be invited’ and my friend goes ‘if you can afford it at that point’ and my mom says ‘I don’t even understand how this got negative??’ I snapped. I shouldn’t have, and I know that but I did. I ask her what my paper was about and she says ‘you already told me’ ‘so what’s it about then?’ ‘Why does it matter?’ ‘Whats it about mom?’ And she uses the exact same wrong phrasing. I ask her if she even knows someone who has written a paper (the answer being no) but she won’t just say no, just why does it matter. Finally I say, ‘this is important to me… why don’t you care?’ And she’s got nothing, just sitting there with no emotion at all through the whole thing. My brother gets up and says he’s going home because people can’t get along or whatever and I go to my room to just bawl. (Apparently as he left he calmly explained to her that he wouldn’t be hanging around both of us anymore, but he wouldn’t come back to see me before I go). As sim as he leaves she goes into the living room and starts laughing and joking with the rest of the family.

While I’m sitting in the room I’m staying in I look around the room and realize… it’s like a museum of misery and erasure. Pictures of dogs, my brother (not step siblings, just bio), even her dog’s kennel certificates - but not a single photo of me (she has some she just ‘didn’t get a chance to put them up’ in 6 months…). It’s got stuffed animals (1 I purchased but not a single one that I physically crocheted for her despite her demanding that I spend time making her one during her last visit to my house). It’s also an uncomfortable futon with a memory foam topper UNDER the mattress not on top, it’s got weird vents that connect directly to the kitchen and living room meaning any noise in the house came into this room (I got like maybe 4 hours of sleep each night I was there). The more I looked around the room, the more I started hysterically laughing because it was like perfectly designed to make me miserable, while still having enough to make me sound insane if I brought it up.

Day 6 my friend and I just needed out of the house and they wanted to get speciality paints from a store in a nearby town so I asked my little brother (the only person with a car besides my mom) if he would bring us. I apologized for the argument and upsetting him and promised not to talk about it (as long as he didn’t want too). My mom starts blowing up his phone the MOMENT we leave the drive way saying he’s ’taking my side.’ I kept my promise and didn’t bring up anything but eventually the text messages got to him. He opens up a bit about how he’s been feeling and I mention the things she said to me about him during the triangulation a few days ago (as close to verbatim as possible and verified by my friend who was there) and my brother is now pissed. Because she essentially said that he was financially ruining her… but he gave her 3000$. We end up talking more and ‘comparing notes’ I suppose and I notice these patterns going back years, decades. I still try to be kind and bring her home special doughnuts she loves. It’s 8pm when I get home and she’s in her room, so I knock on the door and try to explain I brought her a treat home… ignored. The dog starts whining and scratching at the door… ignored. I try knocking again… ignored. 10 minutes later she lets the dog out because it won’t stop whining. 10 minutes after that she comes out for 30 seconds, walks into the living room, and then heads back to her room. I tell her about the doughnut and in the flattest tone ever ‘oh, thanks’ and then gone for the rest of the night.

I decide to ask my dad for coffee (he was working until about midnight) so we can chat about everything and I wanted to know if he saw these patterns. My dad has ASPD (psychopathy) believe me or don’t, this is my ridiculous life, but he’s ALWAYS been blunt with me about his internal thoughts and ‘feelings’ (example: ‘you shouldn’t empathize with people, empathy is for the weak’ - okay dad…) So I figured if I asked him, he’d be honest too, and he was… sort of… he did say that my mom was ‘the perfect mother’ until I was about 6 or so. And that he ‘never loved her’ but he wanted kids so he married the first woman who would give him kids (okay dad…). However, he ALSO points out she wanted two kids but it didn’t matter which two kids, just that we (my brother and I) existed - something my brother and I have always felt and have said to each other in the past. Maybe he picked up on what we wanted to hear, I don’t know 🤷‍♀️. I do want to mention, she actually had affairs (multiple) throughout their marriage (he had one). She walked away from the marriage with every asset, and he walked away with every bill. The more I think about it, the more I feel like maybe SHE was always the dominant predator??

Day 7 I wake up with a brutal migraine (probably from stress) and I barely make it to the bathroom before vomiting in the sink. My mom comes downstairs to ‘check on me’… by asking how late I was out, if I ate anything (I said I didn’t eat anything TWICE) before ending the conversation with ‘do you always overindulge like this?’ - I’m on the floor, barely able to move, and in EXCRUCIATING pain… she didn’t even bring me a water or ask if I needed medication… but do I always overindulge like this? I avoid her the rest of the day and go out for dinner with my dad.

Day 8 I’m finally leaving to go home and I wake up an hour before we need to leave and my mom’s still in her room (she’s not coming to bring me to the airport… is the first thing I think), but I start getting ready. I wake up my friend, we are waiting to go and it’s 15 minutes until leaving and my mom’s still not out of her room. 5 minutes to go and she exits in her PJs still ‘my dog is really sick, I’m worried so I’m going to stay home’ she says. ‘The dog hasn’t pooped yet.’ 😂 okay mom. My step dad drives us to their airport and when we touchdown at home I send her an empathetic message saying I can’t have her in my life anymore. There is no nice way to say it, but I did my damn best to tell her I love her, we just can’t keep doing this. And I blocked her. Not 5 mins later I get a text from my step dad calling me a coward, telling me I’m just like my dad. So I blocked him too without responding. I gave my brother a heads up and said ‘I just wanted to let you know I said goodbye to mom. You can read my message if you want, but I don’t want you in the middle of anything’.

And I thought I’d feel relief, or something positive? But I don’t. I feel better than if I didn’t do it, but I don’t feel good…

If you made it this far, thank you. I’m sorry it was so long. So far this has only been the last week but realistically so much more has happened. If you want to keep reading:

1.	⁠I made her a crocheted scarf when she came to visit (and I’m good at it, not that it matters a lot, but they take me HOURS and I constantly get requests to make things) and not even a week later after she gets home I get a message from maternal grandmother ‘thanking me for the beautiful scarf’. When I asked my mom if she gave it away because she didn’t like something about it she didn’t give me a straight answer and just said ‘lol’
2.	⁠I specifically asked for NOT a tv. I don’t want a tv, I need to move for school soon and TVs break, I’m fairly blind and projectors work better, and I legitimately don’t have a place for a tv - guess what I got for my birthday? When I talked to my brother about it long story shorter she had said ‘your sister hated our last present and BEGGED me for a tv.’ Why buy an expensive present I didn’t want? Because she wanted a TV for when she visits ONCE A YEAR.
3.	⁠I searched ‘sorry’ ‘proud’ and ‘good job’ in our chat history and never once in 15 years of messages did she say these things to me. She’s never posted about my accomplishments on Facebook but she posts CONSTANT pictures of her dogs. And when I won a prestigious scholarship she said… ‘congratulations’ that’s it, and didn’t ask me about it on the phone either just ‘yeah I saw it on Facebook.’
4.	⁠She invited herself to play video games with my brother and I. Despite 200+ hours, plus spending money on her in the game, etc etc she will still say my brother doesn’t do anything for her and never helps her. When I play with her she’s so mean to me that I end up in tears every time. I tried to play high (to cope honestly, weed is legal here) and she wouldn’t stop bothering me. So I didn’t do weed again (but she kept bothering me STILL - even after I said NUMEROUS times I didn’t have weed)
5.	⁠I saved the most horrific for this last comment, I have so much more (56 tbh, my clinical brain would not stop) but I think it’s enough? I don’t know? Anyhow…

My step dad was sober, had two kids, and an 11 year marriage when they had an affair. Since then she has bullied him into drinking ‘you’re not a real man if you can’t drink’, buying him alcohol, and just being all around cruel. He lost his job, and now works 3 jobs to fund her vacations (that he doesn’t get to go on btw). She had him drain his retirement to buy a trailer that their car can’t even tow… while hers stays completely untouched. She’s isolated him from his kids, friends, and he’s basically just a shell of a person at this point. Day 6 of my trip was his birthday - can you guess what they did to celebrate? If it’s ’nothing’ you are correct!

So… why the fuck do I feel so bad and guilty and shitty? And honestly, if you want to tell me this is AI, or I’m making it up or ANYTHING except something that’s kind or helpful - please don’t. I don’t need it right now. I know my mom is going to tell every family member I have left what a shitty person I am, and how I’m cruel and mean… and I just don’t need more right now. I’m a real person, and my situation is horribly real… I just want to know I’m not alone?",2,1762422420.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

The solution lies in one powerful concept: [remote team habits](https://gwork.io/blog/how-habits-improve-remote-team-collaboration/).

At [GWork](https://gwork.io/), we’ve learned that successful remote work isn’t about more meetings or fancy tools. It’s about consistent, everyday habits that shape how teams communicate, stay organized, and achieve results. These habits create structure in an environment where independence is the norm.

Let’s explore how developing strong remote team habits can enhance productivity, strengthen collaboration, and build a positive work culture - no matter where your team works from.

# 1. What Are Remote Team Habits?

Remote team habits are the recurring actions, behaviors, and rituals that guide how distributed teams operate. They include small but impactful routines like daily updates, weekly syncs, or end-of-week celebrations.

When these habits are well-practiced, work becomes smoother and more predictable. Everyone understands what needs to be done, by whom, and when.

Unlike office-based teams, remote teams can’t rely on quick desk conversations. That’s why habits become their invisible structure - replacing supervision with **self-discipline** and ensuring seamless collaboration across distances.

# 2. Why Remote Team Habits Matter

Without structure, remote work can easily turn chaotic. Missed updates, unclear communication, and feelings of isolation can affect both productivity and morale. Strong team habits solve these problems by keeping everyone aligned and connected.

Here’s how they help:

# a. Strengthen Communication

Habits like daily check-ins or weekly catch-ups ensure everyone is informed and engaged. They prevent confusion and help build a sense of team unity.

# b. Build Accountability

Regular updates make progress visible. When everyone shares their goals and results, accountability becomes part of the culture.

# c. Enhance Team Connection

Small social rituals — such as virtual coffee breaks or Friday shoutouts — help team members feel valued and connected.

# d. Improve Productivity

Habits reduce decision fatigue. When workflows are consistent, people focus more on meaningful work instead of figuring out what to do next.

# e. Support Work-Life Balance

Defined boundaries like no-meeting days or set work hours protect mental health and promote long-term well-being.

In short, **remote team habits** build the foundation for productivity, collaboration, and emotional stability.

# 3. Key Remote Team Habits That Drive Success

High-performing remote teams share a few consistent practices. These habits might seem small, but together they create powerful, sustainable results.

# 1. Clear and Consistent Communication

Communication is the backbone of remote teamwork. Without it, teams lose alignment and motivation.

**Best practices include:**

* Use dedicated tools - Slack for chat, Zoom for meetings, Notion or ClickUp for project tracking.
* Set clear rules: use messages for quick updates, calls for deep discussions.
* Document everything - it keeps everyone aligned even if someone misses a meeting.

When communication flows smoothly, teams stay connected, transparent, and productive.

# 2. Structured Daily Routines

Remote work often blurs personal and professional boundaries. Shared routines help bring order.

**Simple yet powerful habits include:**

* **Morning check-ins:** Everyone shares priorities for the day.
* **Evening wrap-ups:** Summarize what’s done and what’s next.
* **Weekly goal reviews:** Discuss progress and challenges openly.

Routines bring rhythm to remote work and help maintain focus.

# 3. Goal-Oriented Work Habits

Successful teams always work with clear direction. Goals bring purpose and motivation to daily tasks.

**How to make it work:**

* Define weekly or monthly goals clearly.
* Break large projects into smaller, manageable milestones.
* Track and review progress regularly.

At **GWork**, we help teams connect personal goals with company objectives - keeping everyone aligned and motivated.

# 4. Regular Feedback and Recognition

Feedback fuels growth. Recognition keeps people inspired.

**To make it a habit:**

* Hold regular 1:1 check-ins.
* Encourage peer feedback.
* Celebrate even small wins publicly.

When feedback and appreciation become part of the workflow, people feel valued and engaged.

# 5. Team Rituals for Connection

Remote teams need emotional connection just as much as professional collaboration.

**Try these rituals:**

* **Weekly shoutouts** for good work.
* **Virtual coffee sessions** for informal bonding.
* **Monthly celebrations** for birthdays or milestones.

These rituals make work more enjoyable and build lasting team spirit.

# 6. Transparency and Trust

Trust is the foundation of any remote team. Transparency helps maintain it.

**Build trust through:**

* Open dashboards for project updates.
* Shared documentation for decisions.
* Owning mistakes and sharing learnings.

When teams communicate honestly, trust grows naturally.

# 7. Continuous Learning

The best teams keep evolving. They stay open to learning new tools, skills, and methods.

**Encourage learning by:**

* Hosting monthly knowledge-sharing sessions.
* Offering opportunities to learn new tech or strategies.
* Promoting a “teach what you learn” culture.

Continuous learning keeps teams agile and future-ready.

# 4. Common Challenges in Building Remote Team Habits

Forming new habits takes time, especially when people work independently. Here are some common hurdles and how to overcome them:

# a. Inconsistent Participation

Some members may skip check-ins or forget updates.  
👉 **Solution:** Leaders should model consistency - when leaders follow the routine, others will too.

# b. Communication Overload

Too many messages or meetings can drain energy.  
👉 **Solution:** Define boundaries - for example, no meetings after 5 PM or “focus hours” for deep work.

# c. Low Motivation

Lack of physical presence can make people feel disconnected.  
👉 **Solution:** Add fun rituals - quizzes, virtual lunches, or friendly challenges.

# d. Burnout

Remote employees can overwork unknowingly.  
👉 **Solution:** Promote wellness habits like breaks, fixed work hours, and digital detox days.

Small adjustments can help teams maintain balance and consistency over the long term.

# 5. How Leaders Can Encourage Positive Habits

Leaders play a major role in shaping a team’s behavior. Their actions influence how others work.

**Effective remote leaders:**

# a. Lead by Example

They show up on time, communicate clearly, and follow the same systems they expect from others.

# b. Build Systems, Not Rules

Habits stick when supported by structure. Automate check-ins, reminders, or dashboards to make consistency effortless.

# c. Empower Ownership

Allow employees to manage their work freely while staying aligned with shared goals. Ownership builds accountability.

# d. Recognize Consistency

Celebrate teams or individuals who maintain positive habits - public recognition reinforces good behavior.

At **GWork**, we believe leadership in remote settings is about **empowerment over enforcement**. When leaders trust and inspire, habits thrive.

# 6. Tools That Support Remote Team Habits

Technology plays a key role in simplifying collaboration. The right tools make remote teamwork smoother and more efficient.

**Recommended tools include:**

* **Messaging:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord
* **Task Management:** Asana, Trello, or GWork’s workflow platform
* **Documentation:** Notion, Confluence, or Google Docs
* **Time Tracking:** Clockify or Toggl
* **Wellness:** Headspace or Calm

Integrate these tools wisely to support - not complicate - your team’s daily workflow.

# 7. Measuring the Success of Remote Team Habits

To improve, teams must track what’s working. Measuring the success of your habits provides clarity and direction.

**Metrics to monitor:**

* **Engagement:** Participation in meetings or feedback sessions.
* **Productivity:** Task completion rate, project delivery times.
* **Satisfaction:** Employee surveys or well-being check-ins.

At **GWork**, we use behavioral insights to analyze team patterns and optimize workflows - ensuring habits lead to measurable progress.

# 8. The Future of Remote Team Habits

The future of work is hybrid - a mix of remote and in-office collaboration. In this model, strong habits will matter more than ever.

AI-powered tools will soon automate reminders, summarize meetings, and track progress. Yet, human habits - empathy, communication, and trust - will remain irreplaceable.

Teams that master strong remote habits today will be the ones who stay adaptable, creative, and connected in the future.

# Conclusion

The success of remote work doesn’t depend on where people are — it depends on **how they work together**. Clear communication, structured routines, transparent goals, and mutual trust form the foundation of every productive remote team.

At **GWork**, we help organizations build these habits through systems that simplify workflows and enhance teamwork.

When teams embrace positive habits, they don’t just perform better — they enjoy their work more. Remote work becomes not just flexible, but truly **fulfilling**.",1,1762422025.0,usacommunitywork,0,1.0,False

(spoiler: yes),"Most people think Lisbon is only great in summer, but those who’ve spent a few winter days here know the city feels completely different then. Fewer tourists, slower pace, locals actually taking their time. and yes, still plenty of sunshine, even in January.

You’ll want a good jacket because it can get chilly with the wind and humidity, but don’t overpack. Lisbon winters are mild, though the city’s hills will keep you warm anyway. Forget the cheap umbrellas: they never survive the wind.

One of the best parts about visiting this time of year is that you can actually enjoy the cafés without queues. Sit down at A Brasileira or Copenhagen Coffee Lab, grab a pastel de nata straight out of the oven, and just watch life go by.

Take advantage of the quieter season to explore Alfama or Mouraria at your own pace. The narrow streets feel even more atmospheric when it’s misty, and you’ll get much better photos without crowds in the background. If you’re into photography, winter light in Lisbon is something special. soft, golden, and perfect around sunset.

Don’t skip the viewpoints either. Miradouro da Senhora do Monte or Santa Luzia look amazing with the winter sky, especially after the rain when everything glows.

And when it rains non-stop (because yes, sometimes it does), check out the museums — MAAT, Gulbenkian, or even the Oceanário if you need a slower day. Then find a cozy spot for dinner, Time Out Market is (a lot) touristy but fun, and traditional tascas around Graça or Campo de Ourique are always a good call.

Lisbon in winter feels more real, more local. You won’t get beach weather, but you’ll get the soul of the city.",0,1762421880.0,VisitPortugalGuide,0,0.5,False

Anyway, I was prediabetic for a while so I was put on a couple of medications and I'm following up with my doctor on them, and apparently they have another use for weightloss (I wouldn't recommend, they make me feel ill most of the day and I completely lost my appetite) but food isn't the problem with lipedema, it's merely a contributing factor, so I took that opportunity to further lose weight by working out as much as my schedule allows (full-time employee and part-time Master's program, both very demanding) and luckily I lost around 14 kg in about 10 months and my pre-diabetes is reversed so I'm now safe and no longer at risk of type 2 diabetes, all is good news right?

The thing is, I'm really tired of how heavy I feel, of how my legs hurt like they were hit with a hammer anytime I accidentally hit it slightly or how even poking can hurt, ngl too, the self-confidence issues it causes me is horrible, I don't think anyone should be ashamed of how they look and I try to accept myself but I still feel insecure to show any parts of me, I don't like my arms, legs, back, none of it, and I'm horrified of it getting worse, now that diabetes meds served their purpose, I stopped using them and the fear is back! Hence, this post.

I've been looking into solutions, I tried lymphatic drainage therapy, it hurt so bad, a normal person would feel pain, let alone someone with lipedema! It hurt so much and the therapist even told me that she's not even doing too much and that if she goes any lighter it won't do anything! I did 8 sessions and they were a nightmare and the improvement was too little it caused me to get even more frustrated, I tried coffee and cinnamon scrubs as some people said they help with cellulite, didn't help at all.

Now I hate surgeries, but I feel like I exhausted every possible non-surgical solution out there, working out, yoga, pilates, HIIT, cardio, weights, you name it, I did it, I even stuck to a personal trainer for 4 months and she was surprised I didn't lose weight by the third month, I just got slightly stronger and more flexible, she doubted that I was eating unhealthy at home, but actually I had subscribed those months to a healthy meal thingy where I only ate the amount of calories she specifically recommended based on my BMI analysis, I did calorie-deficit, intermittent fasting, lymphatic drainage both by wooden instruments and by hand, scrubs and creams, and diabetes meds (for their purpose, the weightloss was just a happy side effect), now I'm thinking the only I have left to try is lipo, but I'm really scared, I have under 3 months left on my Master's program so I wanna be efficient and start getting consultations for the lipo so that I can schedule it once I completed my program and have some time to myself to recover.

I'm also more concerned now because my varicose veins are increasing around the legs, I know pics would be helpful but I don't wish to share.

I really apologise for the lengthy post, I just thought it would help to give clear context of what I did and didn't do, how was your experience with lipo? What can you tell me about it? I'm overweight but I don't wish to share my weight, I'm realistic, I don't want to be a model, I just want to reduce the risk of future implications or my situation worsening, and I wanna feel a little more confient to dress nicely, thank you for taking the time to read and respond, I really appreciate it!",1,1762421729.0,lipedema,0,1.0,False

1opuhl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1opuhl0/bumped_into_her_two_weeks_after_breakup/,Bumped into her two weeks after breakup,"I (25M) recently broke up with my Ex (24F) little over two weeks ago and bumped into her today.

To give a short synopsis the breakup was initiated on my behalf after we dated for two years. Things were mostly good at the start but prior to me asking her out there was few red flags where instances she tried to make me jealous in front of other guys and also her displaying a short temper. This short temper and her reactions being disproportionate to the situation increased the months after we became official and became somewhat unbearable that I decided to breakup. She then said she would change and go to therapy and did a few sessions. I found myself sucked back in and we went back to dating over the course of last summer. This time I did notice a shift where she would be more communicative and more controlling of her temper and her mood shifted less. I guess I didn’t feel like I was walking on eggshells anymore. However I was concerned when she told me that she had stopped seeing her therapist after 5 sessions. I then started wonder did she really want genuine change. Then the last few months she became a little bit more clingy than usual (which is fine) but more so to a controlling point. I would be accused of cheating for going to the gym with a friend or she would begin crying if I met a friend for coffee. I felt this linked more to control. This eventually spiralled a bit into her one night ringing my phone over 10 times when I said the electrician was coming to my house. I gave her the time I’d be done and said I would pick her up but she began walking towards my house and said she had been attacked after I rang her back following 10 missed calls and 15 texts. The texts were things like “ do you care” , “are you cheating”. I comforted her after and things went back to normal the next day but I wasn’t gonna question the validity of her story. A few days later I ended the relationship as It didn’t feel right anymore and I didn’t feel like I could live a normal life and be worried about making someone else upset when I’m doing basic activities and also it’s not good for them.

Anyway, yesterday I was clothes shopping in the city and ran into her very suddenly. We ended on good terms so I expected her to stop and talk but she didn’t and kept walking. She did say hello and I returned a hello back. I thought I was more over the relationship than I thought but my heart dropped with nerves however I don’t know if this is the remaining emotional ties or just the situation. I thought after about why she didn’t stop to talk but then thought she did look like she was in a rush or trying to make a train. Even her not stopping probably was better in hindsight as even small talk would have been hurtful. I will say it was such a weird feeling just saying hello to someone two weeks ago that you were building your future with. Now they are just a stranger. I found it hard to focus for the rest of evening and also annoyed and feel vulnerable because I thought I was more over her. She sent me a short text after to say I looked good and I followed back to say it was nice to see her as I didn’t want to build any dialog as we have established No contact albeit for necessary situations like if we come across old items that belong to one another other. 

Today, the interaction is still upsetting me. I felt off at work and sad. I know this relationship is bad for me hence why I’m staying away and broke up but the interaction made me feel vulnerable and that if she really wanted me back and applied the pressure then I could cave. I have worked really hard journaling and reflecting the last few weeks and working out as well as being intentful In doing things that help me recover from the stress of the relationship. 

Sorry for the long post, I just feel like it was 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Any advice is welcome and I’d like to hear if others have experienced the same situation..",3,1762421449.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

>By nature, they say, to commit injustice is a good and to suffer it is an evil, but that the excess of evil in being wronged is greater than the excess of good in doing wrong… Justice, they tell us, being mid-way between the two, is accepted and approved, not as a real good, but as a thing honored in the lack of vigor to do injustice, since anyone who had the power to do it and was in reality 'a man' would never make a compact with anybody either to wrong nor to be wronged; for he would be mad. 

* Glaucon, *The Republic*



>The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.

* H.P. Lovecraft, *The Call of Cthulhu*



In the second book of his *Republic*, Plato (through the character Glaucon) presents a story which is known as Gyges’ ring. This is how the story goes:

There is a poor shepherd named Gyges, who, after a storm and earthquake, finds a brazen horse in a pit which had opened up in the pasture where he worked. Opening up a door in the hollow statue, he finds a corpse of a god with a gold ring. Taking the ring, Gyges returns to his flock. 

Later, Gyges discovers that he becomes invisible to all men that are present if he wears the ring with the gem facing inward. He quickly succumbs to his desires, and becoming the king’s messenger, seduces the queen, murders the king and usurps him, then proceeds to live as a veritable god of debauchery. 

 I guess it’s the same kind of concept as absolute power corrupting absolutely, or at least along the same lines. Glaucon, in presenting this story, says that the license this power would afford a man would practically force him to do injustice. Socrates combats this by arguing that justice is its own reward for the just. I’m skeptical of both. 

Glaucon got something wrong, though. Not the part about absolute anonymity causing corruption –I wouldn’t know about that– but about being invisible to humans constituting absolute anonymity. Some things can only be noticed when one is hidden from humanity themselves, and some of those things notice you right back. If Glaucon was right, my current theory of why I haven’t gone completely psycho hedonist is disgust. I certainly feel disgust whenever one of the Folding Lady smiles at my misconduct....



I’m getting away from myself with these musings. Let me start over.





# Part One: Van Gogh

I woke up with a start, a surge of adrenaline causing me to practically leap out of my bunk. Since starting work at Camp Quabbin, I had awoken much the same way every morning, so I was pretty used to it by now, it being my second summer there. Turning the alarm off on my phone, I slapped Del’Shaun’s knee, which was poking out of his blanket, jutting out from the precipice of the upper bunk. The lump which was ‘Shaun made a vague attempt at verbal protest, and the knee retreated. 

“C’mon, man, 5:15. We can’t be late to set up for flags and ring the bell again; Downey will can us,” I said, putting on my uniform. 

“Yeahmuhgettinnup,” he delivered eloquently, as he half fell, half swung out of his bunk, “I really don’t understand why you insist on volunteering to do this.”

“I like seeing the sun rise, and I like seeing the empty camp,” I replied, throwing the cabin door open. The rush of cold alpine air refreshed me, but elicited fresh grumbling from ‘Shaun, who was still in an exposed state. “Besides, when we get up this early, you get the first coffee.” I didn't add that it was Friday, and since this round of campers were leaving, we would be getting the weekend off. Since we basically grew up together, I knew ‘Shaun's morning grumblings were far from serious, more of a ritual than anything else.

With the promise of coffee urging him on, Del'Shaun managed to pull together, and was slowly regaining his normal cheerful personality as we walked up the main hill 15 minutes later, towards the flag pole and mess hall. After Shaun had coffee from his beloved Keurig in the Staff Lounge, we woke the camp with the bell.

Camp Quabbin was a scout camp, and like with all other scout camps, when the day began, it began in full swing. After flags, the whole camp population jammed itself, with the façade of patience and order, into the rows of tables and benches. Then, food was served, buffet style. Hannah and Chloe joined us in line.

Del'Shaun and I had met Hannah freshman year, when we were the only freshmen in our physics class, and made a study group together. We were both interested in her, but since ‘Shaun beat me in a custom match of CoD Gun Game where we bet on it, we agreed he could make the first move. They were a thing for a bit, but ended up agreeing to just be friends. By then, I too had lost interest, and now we were an inseparable trio. Until I left for college, that is. That's part of the reason Del'Shaun and Hannah agreed to work here with me this summer, in the first place. 

“So, what are we gonna do tonight?” Chloe turned to me, lightly smiling. My heartbeat skipped a little. 

Chloe was Hannah’s cabin mate, and had immediately fit into our group when Hannah introduced us. She was one of those girls who was weird in an alluring way. Her shocking green eyes were always slightly unfocused behind her circular glasses, in a way that seemed like she could see into you. She knitted her own clothes, and when not in camp staff uniform, she could usually be seen wearing a loose sweater and one of her armada of large, colorful, handmade berets, which made her look kind of like a mushroom, and having one shoe permanently untied. I always wanted to tie that shoelace for her.

“...thinking we could go to Van Gogh again. Moss should be lit up again; it's past due.” Shaun was saying, as he stomped, hard, on my foot. He was not shy about telling me to ask her out already, when we were in private. 

Flushing, I realized I had zoned out like a moron, and quickly added , “Y-yeah! You haven’t been there yet, right? You'll love it,” with a little too much excitement. “Also, it's lichen, not moss,” I corrected, turning to Del'Shaun. “You should know the difference- working with the Nature Crew.” He grinned at me.

“Sounds fun. We should drive to Ray's in town beforehand and get some stuff,” Hannah nodded. I could see in her eyes that she was laughing at me.

After breakfast, we all headed to our areas. Del'Shaun and Chloe worked at the nature building on the east side of camp, while Hannah and I worked near the north edge. We usually walked in silence, listening to the morning sounds. That is one of the things I liked best about Hannah and my friendship: We both enjoyed silent company. However, as my path was about to turn off to the climbing area, and her road continue on to the horsemanship area, she turned to me.

“You really should make a move soon, Lliam. Girls won’t wait while you hesitate forever, even if they like you, too.” She looked serious. Shaun and her were very similar at times, I noticed.

I stopped and kicked a rock off of the path, staring at our feet. “I know, I just… I don't know… with college and all of that…” Then I stopped. “Say that again- ‘likes me too’?”

“Don't let going away to college ruin this!\~” She sang, skipping off and leaving me standing on the trail with a stupid, dreamy smile.

The rest of the work day passed like a breeze, pushed along by Hannah’s hint; Chloe liked me too! Not even the glacial pace at which the kids learned climbing knots soured my mood. I decided to take both of my friends’ advice at the next opportunity, remembering all of the previous fumbles and kicking myself. 

After all of the parents had come and picked up the throngs of campers, we all met up at Chloe's Honda Odyssey in the dirt parking lot. She was the only one with a car; the three of us just were dropped off by Hannah's parents, and were going to be picked up by mine. 

Ray’s was a little convenience store in town that was run by a gruff, ancient veteran named Ray, and his granddaughter, Julie. Neither of them carded for alcohol, so it became a favorite stop for underage camp staff on the weekends. We could have just sent someone with a grocery list, but had decided over breakfast that it would be more fun to make an outing of it. We grabbed a boatload of junk food and some drinks, and headed back to camp. 

After we packed our supplies and sleeping gear into backpacks, we headed towards Van Gogh, the sun over our left shoulders. We filled the late evening air with our laughter as we came to the small clearing near the cave entrance that we usually stayed and set up our hammocks and sleeping bags.

Van Gogh was a place I had found last summer with another counselor, when I was exploring the unfrequented areas of the camp property. At first, I only introduced Del'Shaun to it, and then we had invited Hannah and Chloe before (swearing them to secrecy). However, Chloe had always wanted to do something else with the other female counselors before now, and Hannah often joined her, so usually it was just me and ‘Shaun. After our setup was completed, I turned enthusiastically toward the girls on the other side of the clearing.

“Let's go show Chloe the cave!” I felt childish, being visibly excited like this, but in the moment, I didn't care, and the others seemed just as excited, including Chloe. Seeing her beaming face made me even more excited. I grabbed a bag, and led the procession. The mouth opened vertically downward, so I had to set up a natural anchor point with a nearby tree to rappel into the cave. Opening the bag I had brought, I set up the rappel and the others put on harnesses. As I finished, Hannah covered Chloe's eyes with a blindfold. Of course she had heard of the caves from us, but at this point it was a tradition that when first introduced to the caves, one must be immersed at once, rather than gradually.

Del'Shaun went first, with me lowering him down. He “whooped” as I let him down quickly, urging me to go faster. I resisted his requests, preferring caution. After ‘Shaun was Chloe, with ‘Shaun ready at the bottom to steady her. Finally, Hannah was at the bottom, and it was time for me to rappel myself. 

Rappelling into Van Gogh was always a uniquely magical experience. As you lowered into the cave, if you kept your eyes towards the sky, it looked like the beginning of a hyperspace jump from Star Wars, played in reverse. At first once or twice, then tens, then hundreds of little light streaks would pass by your head from behind, shooting upwards. Of course, this was only an illusion, as you were the one moving, not the lights. Then, as you reached the cavern floor, you would look around and see the breathtaking sight which was the reason I named the cave system Van Gogh in the first place; thousands of multicolored strips of bioluminescent lichen spiraling and wrapping around each other on the cave walls in a way startlingly reminiscent of Van Gogh's Starry Night. 

“Ok. Let's show her,” I said, feeling proud to be the one who shared this with them all. As the blindfold fell away from her eyes, we watched as she turned in a slow circle, her wide eyes and glasses reflecting what she was seeing. 

After the initial sight, we toured Chloe around the safe sections of the cave. None of us knew how deep the cave really went, as every branched passage eventually had some obstacle or tight passage that none were eager to risk navigating. We were content to let Van Gogh maintain his air of mystique, and enjoy the natural work of art presented to us. The main cavern, which was a little way off from the shaft that led to the surface, was wide and tall, and so brightly lit with blues and yellows that we could sit and see each other's faces. 'Shaun, who had brought our drinks and snacks, brought them out, as well as a set of cards. We all enjoyed a game of cards, filling the cave with laughter and smiles. 

After a few games, ‘Shaun stood up, stretching. “I'm gonna go get the fire going and make dinner,” he said.

Hannah stood up, too. “I'll help you out.” On the way out of the cave, you always needed another person to belay while you climbed. Naturally, I thought nothing of it, until 15 minutes later, when I realized that Hannah had climbed up too. Remembering my promise to myself, I now felt less brave. I was alone in the cave with Chloe.

She was looking at the walls with the same wonder I felt every time I saw the cave.

“What… what are they?” 

I realized I had been holding my breath while staring at her earnest face. I shifted my gaze back to the wall. “The lichen?” She nodded. “I don't really know. I asked Stefanie, the head of the nature program last summer, and she had no idea beyond lichen, which I already knew. Then I looked it up, and apparently, no known species of lichen displays bioluminescence like this - just fluorescence. I think it's a unique species.”

“You’re really smart, you know? No wonder you got that scholarship,” She was looking at me now, smiling.

I felt myself flush. I never knew what to do in situations like this, being complimented and having nothing to return. The scholarship was a sore subject, too. I wanted to take up the family business, the lumber mill, but now my parents wanted “a brighter future” for me. So I shifted the subject: “Anyways, that's why we swore you to secrecy. If people knew about this, they'd shut down this whole area for study, and we'd never get to see this again. Or they'd make it a tourist trap, with cordoned off walkways and admission fees.”

“Both sound terrible!” Chloe exclaimed, her outrage echoing out of sight.

“Yeah,” I replied, feeling as if there should be some better response to that.

I couldn't think of anything else to say, so I sat there, feeling the awkward silence growing. I could hear my heartbeat. As my tension heightened, I heard myself speaking, stumbling over my words to get them out.

“So, we’ve known each other for a bit now, and I’ve been thinking – I want to get to know you better…what I mean is; I really like you. Would you like to go out on a date with me?” I blurted the last part out, feeling heat radiating off of my face.

Because of the lighting, I could not read her expression. She shifted, then began to speak, but I could not hear her response, because a horrible trembling began to shake the ground, and a roaring, twisting, cracking sound filled the cavern.

“Cover your head!” I screamed, pantomiming. “Follow me!” She nodded. Crawling with one arm, and covering my head with the other, I led the way to the shaft leading to the surface. It was too unsteady to stand, the previously sturdy rock beneath us had become like the deck of a ship on a stormy sea. Small rubble rained down on us, and wide cracks began to appear around us. 

At some point, my memory fails me. I don't remember how quickly we got to the rope , or when Chloe hit her head, or how I raised her limp form and myself halfway up the shaft, before Hannah and Del'Shaun were able to help us the rest of the way up. I gathered all of that from their panted exclamations to me after I had regained some presence of mind. All I remember from that time is the sheer terror of it all; the fear of a mouse being swallowed up by what it recognises a huge, scaly monster, because mice don't know what snakes are until it's too late. That, and the menacing image of the swirls of lichen physically swirling, growing. Making the cavern tighten like a hydraulic press. Or the gizzard of a giant bird.

When I snapped to, I was laying on the edge of the cave, breathing at an incredible rate. I wiped my hand across my brow, realizing with detached clarity that I had ripped nearly half of my fingernails off, and tore several of my muscles, in my mad exodus. My left arm hung limp, caused by a combination of these self-inflicted injuries and a large, lichen-covered piece of stone having struck it.

I turned my attention to Chloe. Something, probably a similar piece of rubble had struck her on the upper left of her head. I could see glowing smears of the crushed lichen around the bloody laceration, mixing with her blood. Hannah was cradling her head on the ground, trying to keep her spine straight. Del’Shawn was on his phone, contacting 911 in the only part of the clearing that had service. A large crevice had opened in the earth. A piece of the lichen was in the fire, glowing a color I had never seen before, nor have seen since. It was like a visual scream of agony.

As I took this all in in a state of abstract interest, I looked at my left arm again. The juice of the lichen there seemed to be reacting rapidly to my blood. Where the blue substance mixed with my blood, it began to glow a far brighter purple, and seemed to be spreading. I saw the same happening with Chloe, as well. When the reaction reached my veins, the edges of my vision vibrated. I saw the clearing with new eyes. 

Growing out of the crevice was a twisted, gnarled knot the size of a truck. It appeared to be composed of a mixture of a thorny plant that was colored hot pink, the now malevolent looking lichen, and what looked like gigantic blood vessels, all wrapped together in a chaotic mass. The knot was pulsing like a heart would, but irregularly, frenetically. 

I saw colossal, antlike creatures tending great fuchsia slugs with bright red polka dots in the forest.

I saw little, two-limbed balls of teeth ripping to shreds the carcass of something that looked like a boar with legs the length of a giraffe’s, the relatives of the carcass’ owner lowing and watching mournfully.

I saw a moon, shattered into a hundred shards, yet looming next to the familiar moon, like an injured apex predator ready to devour its unsuspecting neighbor.

I saw the Folding Lady for the first time. She was angry.

Then, I saw nothing, my mind rejecting reality in favor of oblivion.

**Age:** 30

**Occupation:** On a sabbatical. Full-time at-home cat lady.

**Hometown:** Somewhere in Southeast Asia. Low cost of living. I'm travelling from the Middle East, where we have been living for three years.

**Section Two: Assets + Debt** 

**Retirement Balance:** $24,000. This is my own. I don't know my husband's retirement balance, but I think it should be about the same or a little higher now, as he started working later than I did.

**Savings accounts balance:** $78,000. Partly emergency funds, majority for our house fund. This is combined with my husband, though it's split in half between his account and mine.

**Checking account balance:** $4,000.

**Credit card debt:** $0. We pay it off in full every month.

**Student loan debt:** $0. Both of us received scholarships.

**Section Three: Income**

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $1,500-$1,600. I save $200-$300 every month towards retirement and invest whenever I hit $1.8k. Husband's take-home income is $5,000. We are solidly middle class in our home country.

**Any Other Monthly Income:** my husband gives me $900 each month, partly because in our religion and culture it's his obligation to clothe, feed, and house the wife, and partly because I'm on a sabbatical with a 60% reduction in pay to join him at his new job in the Middle East (my ""pay"" is part of his job's benefits and gets deposited directly into my account). It makes me feel better about pausing my career and missing out on my employer's retirement match!

**Section Four: Travel Expenses**

**Transportation:-**

**Flights:** $4,400 for the two of us. I booked mine first in July thinking I was going to go alone, and I bought business class only for my departing flight; then he got the go-ahead for his leave, so he bought economy seats for himself a couple of weeks before our flight date!

$40 for the ride to the airport and back.

**Accommodations:** $108 for the overnight hotel. We mainly stayed at my in-laws'.

**Pre-Vacation Spending:** 

$200 for three weeks' pet supplies, particularly wet food because one of our cats can't eat dry food at all at the moment so we have been feeding him exclusively wet food (we usually feed wet and dry). He also has to be on prescription food, and that's more expensive than regular cat food.  I bought three weeks' worth because I'm a paranoid owner, like what if we get delayed a week or more before we could get back?!

$360 for the cat sitter to come twice a day for nine days to feed our two cats and clean up after them.

$20 to get our bedding in our room laundered before we arrive.

$193.70 in gifts: chocolates, perfumes, and snacks.

\--

It took about 4 months to save for the trip, especially because I wanted business class at least for the departing flight. I skimped on my last trip home of similar length where I took the cheapest route with multiple transits and my body was stiff until two days before my return flight. I was miserable and lacked energy for the majority of the time, which really ruined the trip for me! This time, I wanted to ""invest"" in a comfortable departing flight, in order to look and feel good for the wedding events, as well as have energy to do our many pending errands and spend time with my loved ones.

\--

**Day 1:** Flight day. A chaotic affair before leaving the house because my husband got unexpectedly swamped with overtime work before his leave and I just didn't have the mental capacity after finding out our first IUI failed. We tidy up as best as we can and feed the cats early in the morning and just before going out the door. While taking a break from tidying, my husband goes out and gets both of us a laban drink, a yoghurt bowl with granola, and a hazelnut croissant for each of us for $10. I eat only the croissant. At the airport, we make use of the free lounge access and eat our fill. I still feel like crap having to leave the cats, so to make myself feel better I get a bag of my favourite chips from Pret ($4) before heading in. The flight is long, but having my ereader (Boox Palma 2, The Belle of Belgrave Square by Mimi Matthews, 4/5) and being able to fully recline make the time pass very comfortably!

*Total: $14*

**Day 2:** We arrive midmorning, and we're hungry for a taste of home. My in-laws greet us at the airport. We drag them to our favourite kopitiam for noodles and teh tarik, where we bump into not one, two, nor three, but *four* separate groups of relatives. I guess since the last time I went, it became everybody's favourite?! My mother-in-law pays for our table. My husband and I share a laugh when we see the total is $32.90 for 6 people. My body doesn't hurt at all, so I'm chipper and energised to take on the day!

We go to my in-laws' to unpack, then we're back out the door within the hour. Our second stop of the day is the hair salon! As the stylist combs my wet hair to cut my bangs, my self-esteem takes a giant blow when I look in the mirror and see just how much my hair has thinned out since my last cut; a side effect of going through fertility treatments. We pay $40 for my cut + wash + ""hair treatment"" + dry, $30 for my husband's cut + wash + dry, and $30 for a pomade product for my husband. I leave with my heart feeling battered and bruised.

Afterwards, I stop by the department store to buy a mirror that lights up ($39.99) so I can put on makeup for ID photos and my cousin's three wedding events. On the way home, we buy gas for the car with the only cash we have on hand ($17).

We have dinner at my grandparents', and by some great mercy and miracle they don't mention great-grandchildren even once. They ask about our cats instead, and I love them for that.

*Total: $139.99*

**Day 3:** Before running errands, my husband and I have breakfast at another favourite kopitiam, where we get roti with egg, mee mamak with a sunny side up egg on top, and teh tarik. My eyes bulge out of my sockets in disbelief at the $9.30 total.

We realise it's payday for the public sector when we see there are queues at every ATM at 9am on a Monday. We spend 30 minutes trying to find parking and waiting in line only to find out my husband's card doesn't work, so off we go to a branch that allows withdrawal over the counter. When we reach the bank, my brother texts that he's sending my cousin's physical wedding invitation card to my in-laws' house, and as I hit reply, my husband taps me on the shoulder to point out my brother's wife staring at me! I've just missed him dropping her off! This country is ridiculously small.

We go to another bank to deposit the cash, and while waiting for our turn I pop by the cafe next door for $5 iced lemon tea. This is grossly expensive, but it's delicious on a hot day so I fork out the cash anyway. After a mildly stressful appointment with our banker, we go to the cafe again for a honey cake and something called a jellatte, a latte with coffee jelly ($13.50 total).

For dinner, while my husband sends our event clothes for ironing ($5 for seven items!!!), I meet up with a best friend (A) at a restaurant, where I laugh looking at the prices. We order chicken rice each, a vegetable dish, ice lemon tea, and iced bandung cincau. I pay the $16 total for both of us.

We stop by a drugstore to get razors, eyeliner, and a foundation brush for $23. I accompany her for a couple of errands before she drops me off at home.

*Total: $66.80*

**Day 4:** I try out my new mirror for the first time while putting on makeup for a new ID photo. I haven't worn a full face of makeup in probably a whole year, so I stick to the basics and end up loving my look. We arrive just as the immigration department opens, which is as depressing as you can imagine, but things move fast and it's not even 8.30am yet when we finish ($30).

We swing by the printers to print some documents for the bank (we're buying land!) for $5 before heading for our 9.30am appointment with our banker. We're there for so long that we miss breakfast entirely. After picking up our clothes, we head to an old favourite during our dating days for lunch ($27). 

In the afternoon, while my husband is at his massage appointment ($30 + $10 tip), I go to another drugstore to pick up more supplies. I get a couple more makeup brushes, a sponge, primer, eyebrow gel, and four bottles of our face cleanser to bring back for $100.80.

I still have time to kill before picking up my husband, so I get a no-polish manicure for $12 + $8 tip two minutes away. Bestie A mentioned the last time I saw her that she keeps forgetting her phone, so after my manicure, I buy a crossbody phone strap ($30) for her at the mall one minute away from the nail salon. My husband texts that he's finished just as I'm heading back to my car.

We go to KFC to get cheesy wedges (they don't have them in the Middle East) and while there, we find out they sell really cute cat costumes! We've been wanting some for our annual Eid family photos. We buy two for our cats, and surprisingly each came with free chicken. The total ends up being $38.10.

I find out the primer is a dud that evening when my foundation just won't settle, so my makeup ends up just being passable. We head to the first of my cousin's wedding events, where I meet a cousin's son for the first time. He takes to my husband better than he does me, ugh. I have a lovely time catching up with relatives until we leave at 11.30pm when the sky threatens a storm.

*Total: $304.90*

**Day 5:** I drive to two out of the three banks I have an account with to close my accounts, with one of them being such an ordeal it completely drains me. The overarching theme of our return must be banking errands, however, because just as I'm about to drive to meet up with my childhood best friend for lunch, my husband receives a notice about his nonfunctional card. 

I pick him up from home and we go to lunch at a nice Italian fusion restaurant. Everybody gets pasta, and my husband gets an iced yuzu tea and I get their delicious iced peach tea twice. Our portion ends up being $41.

I fall asleep in the car while waiting for him to be done at the bank, and I continue sleeping at home just until it's time to get ready for the second wedding event. I don't even notice the heavy rain outside nor that the power's gone out during my nap, and my husband has to send our laundry to be finished at the laundromat ($20). 

We get ready mainly in the dark, only using the light from my mirror. This time I eschew the primer and my makeup sinks in beautifully. We leave the event early at 9.30pm because I feel fit to drop, and thankfully everyone accepts my excuses. Someone asks if we haven't yet ""caught"" for a baby just as I'm going out the door. My heart sinks, and I am so, so tired. The power's back on by the time we reach home, and I take the minimum effort to clean up and immediately go to bed.

*Total: $61*

**Day 6:** My husband wants to sleep in, so I go out by myself to meet another best friend for breakfast as she's in my area to get some work done on her car. I pick her up at the workshop at 10am. I order wonton kolomee for myself and another to-go for my husband, and she gets roasted duck rice. With drinks, the total ends up being $21.10. I pay. I drop off my best friend at her house and drive home.

My husband and I stay home until we get hungry around 5pm. We go to an asian fusion restaurant ($45) and get $1 ice cream for dessert. I'm still feeling tired and weak, so I'm asleep by 9pm.

*Total: $67.10*

**Day 7:** We sleep in late, and have tea and some traditional kuih at home for breakfast. We meet my husband's aunt for lunch after the Friday prayer where it turns out she's invited five other relatives as well, along with my husband's parents and brothers. I eat my fill while trying to ignore the overstimulation. I decline to go to the movies with the ladies. The aunt pays.

In the evening, we go to my cousin's third and final wedding event. I give her $200. My husband's granduncle is also coincidentally having his 93rd birthday party at the same time, so my husband drops me off at the wedding venue before going to the party. He stays just long enough to pay his respects, then rushes back to the wedding in time to eat. As the eldest niece, I'm expected to help and stay until after the very last guest leaves, so we end up staying until 11.30pm. My feet hurt and my social battery is at an all-time low.

To decompress, we get a single ice cream ($3.80) to share and eat in the car before heading home.

*Total: $203.80*

**Day 8:** My husband and I meet up with three of our friends for a dim sum brunch. I nearly cry at my first bite of actually decent dim sum since we moved away. My husband pays for everyone ($60).

Afterwards, I meet A again and she drives us to her favourite cafe an hour away, near where another best friend lives. We share extremely delicious desserts and mediocre matcha, and A pays ($41). A drives me home. While I was with my friends, my husband hung out with another group of his friends, but didn't buy anything. He does buy me two packs of plasters ($4.40) on the way home, for a wound on my ankle I've been nursing.

*Total: $64.40*

**Day 9:** My husband booked us a hotel room for one night in a city 3 hours away, so we top up on gas ($20) and have breakfast (roasted duck rice for each of us, ice lemon tea, and kopi o for $28) before leaving. On the way, we pay $3 in tolls.

We find out we've been upgraded to the Executive Suite with a sea view at check-in! The room is just okay but the view is killer. After a short break to stretch our legs, we grab a late lunch ($30), then go shopping! We pick up a fancy Philips steam iron that comes with an extra-wide ironing board ($233) and take several minutes struggling to put it into my sedan. I can't resist the Kate Spade Halo bag in the store ($470), and showing great restraint afterwards I only buy one sports bra ($28) and a coffee bun ($1). My husband buys joggers and shorts ($50), and a pair of jeans and a shirt from Levi's ($133.75). On the way back to the hotel, my husband gets the news that our friend's mum has passed away. We agree to give them $100 as a bereavement gift.

We're so tired from the day that we can't be bothered to leave our room to get dinner. Since we're taking a break from actively trying to conceive for a few months to get the money ready for a second IUI (I have PCOS and don't ovulate on my own so need medication and monitoring), I temporarily lift the ban on taking baths. We enjoy a long hot soak together until the water starts to cool.

I order seafood fried rice and my husband gets mushroom soup through the in-room dining service ($20). While waiting, I make us tea and we watch the first episode of the new season of our comfort show, Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill. I finally feel relaxed and refreshed.

*Total: $1,116.75*

**Day 10:** We pay $45 for the breakfast buffet. They have a good selection of western and local dishes, and everything we try is cooked well. We get back to our room at 8.30am, and my husband immediately decides to take a nap. I pack up our stuff, after which I get lured into lying down as well and end up napping until 11.45am, 15 minutes before check-out time.

There's a selection of really cute woven basket bags made by indigenous women at the hotel lobby, and I decide to get five of a mini design (one of the bags is, of course, for myself) to give as souvenirs for our friends where we currently live ($93.75).

After check-out, my husband wants to get a hot stone massage, which takes 90 minutes ($63). I get a buff and shine manicure ($19) while waiting, then spend the rest of the time playing archived New York Times' Strands in the car. I get so engrossed in the games that I don't even notice the parking ticket under the windshield wiper until after my husband returns! We immediately go to the municipality office to pay the fine, and our promptness gets us a discount so we only end up paying a measly $2! Afterwards, we try a new-to-us restaurant to eat what turns out to be ridiculously good laksa ($20).

On the way back to his parents' house, we stop by a fruit market. My husband loads the car with a dizzying $100 worth of durian and rambutan. The car immediately fills up with the creamy smell of durian, of which thankfully we both love.

We pay the $3 toll on the way, and finally reach home just before 7pm. We still have to pack for tomorrow's flight! We're both tired and cranky, and packing is a test of patience for both of us. We hug and thank each other for powering through it when we finish.

At around 10pm, A texts me while I'm already in bed to tell me she's ready to invest. We had made a pact to make our investments at the same time since I convinced her to start investing if only so we can still travel together after retirement, and I've just been waiting for her. We text each other minute updates. The platform keeps crashing and we keep getting logged out, but we persevere and I invest $1,959.91 into an ETF (>!SPWO!<) and pay $26.23 in platform and exchange rate fees.

*Total: $2305.66*

**Day 11:** Flight day! My husband had to change his ticket at the last minute, which was covered by his work, so I have to go back early by myself (my ticket change would have cost over $1,000). I grab my last breakfast with home flavours at the airport with my in-laws after checking in. My mother-in-law pays. My childhood best friend brings her precious baby son to the airport to send me off. He struggles to remember me since the last time we saw each other he was only three months old, but we get along tolerably well long enough to take pictures with me holding him.

My mum and grandparents stop by the airport to send me off too, and as we hug, my grandmother tells me she'll keep praying for us to have a baby soon. I have to hold back the sudden tears, so I rush to go in for security checks before boarding.

The airline ground staff did me a solid when he checked me in, because I somehow get the whole row to myself and there isn't anyone behind my seat. I recline without guilt, and stretch out as much as I can throughout the long flight. I forgot to download the new book I wanted to read before my flight (another Mimi Matthews), and I don't want to read anything else, so I split the 10 hour journey between napping, snacking, and thinking about our household budget.

With time difference magic, I arrive in the late afternoon, where a driver picks me up from the airport, who was prepaid before my trip. I get home just in time to feed my cats and give them lots of loving. 

*Total: $0*

***Grand Total: $9,468.10***

**Reflections**

This was a really expensive trip! I felt like money just kept falling between my fingers by the minute. The biggest expense was the business class ticket and our tickets on the whole, but there were also things that built up, like the pet-related expenses and shopping (mainly for me), and I don't really know if I should count the investing as ""spending"". I felt we actually underpaid with regards to treating our friends and family... and in fact, we didn't even manage to get to pay even once for a family meal. Next time, I'd like to be faster in reaching for the bill!

I also kind of dislike how every time I go back to our home country, I'm always swamped with life administrative errands that demand our physical presence, but it's just the nature of how our country works, unfortunately. We're expecting to go back again soon to sort out the mortgage, and I'm honestly dreading \*that\* future trip already, because I actually didn't get to do all the things I needed to get done, due to scheduling unavailability during the dates I was at home. While I feel business class was worth it for this trip, I don’t think I would pay for it again for trips in the near future, as we're also saving for the second and potentially third IUI, or even maybe IVF in 2026, though of course I hope we don't have to go through with them to finally have a baby.

Writing this diary as the trip went on was so fun, and I hope everyone enjoyed reading it as I did putting it together!",4,1762420100.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,0,1.0,False

1opu24y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opu24y,Comprehensive Verification Report: Honduras AI Partnership Opportunities,"Comprehensive Verification Report: Honduras AI Partnership Opportunities
This deep dive into AI opportunities in Honduras based on November 2025 data. It’s a verification of emerging partnerships in conservation, agriculture, indigenous languages, and more. Sourced from 50+ reports, studies, and announcements. TL;DR: Honduras is primed for AI-driven impact—real projects already rolling, funding available, and first-mover gaps to fill. Let’s discuss in comments!

November 2025 data shows Honduras at a pivotal juncture. EarthRanger operates in 45 of 75 planned protected areas, remittances hit $9.74 billion (surpassing prior estimates), and digital initiatives like the national Digital ID program launch in 2025. Globally, AI for indigenous languages reaches 92% accuracy, precision agriculture yields 25% increases with 30% cost cuts in Latin America, and Honduras’s 3rd global climate vulnerability ranking underscores urgency for AI early warnings.
This research affirms the core narrative, adding developments that boost credibility. Honduras deploys conservation tech at scale, trains 1,000 youth in AI via partnerships, and advances through República Digital 2022-2025. The opportunity is real, timely, actionable.
Current Statistics Verified and Updated
Climate Vulnerability: Confirmed with Context
Honduras ranks 3rd globally in the 2025 Global Climate Risk Index (Germanwatch, Feb 2025) for 1993-2022, after Dominica and China. This reflects impacts from Hurricane Mitch (1998) and Eta/Iota (2020, affecting 2M people).
No direct hurricane landfalls since 2020 (except Tropical Storm Sara, Nov 2024). This window favors AI early warning rollout before next events. The WMO’s Early Warnings for All targets global coverage by 2027; Honduras’s vulnerability prioritizes it.
Remittances Exceed Estimates
2024 figures: $9.74B, 25-26% of GDP—above the cited $8.8B. March 2025 data: $997.34M monthly. World Bank notes critical reliance. Honduras Global now has 60+ members (from 20 founders); “Brother, Come Home” program launched Jan 2025 with Migration Governance Council, enhancing diaspora ties.
Coffee Production Correction
Adjustment: 5.36-5.50M 60-kg bags (2024/25 USDA forecast), below cited 7.2M. Still 5th globally, largest in Central America. Lower yields heighten AI needs; Brazilian AI farms show 25% yield boosts, 30% cost reductions. AI disease detection hits 99.89% accuracy with real-time processing.
Indigenous Populations and Languages
2013 census: 43,111 Garifuna (43,100 speakers)—nearly double cited 22,000. Lenca: 453,672 (largest); Miskito: 80,007; Pech: 6,024. Total indigenous: 717,618 (~9%).
No AI for Garifuna, Miskito, Lenca—first-mover chance. Mayan projects succeed: Guatemala’s Android keyboards (Dec 2024), Princeton’s $100K Mam AI robot, Peru’s viral Quechua avatar on TikTok.
Internet and Mobile Connectivity
Internet: 65.8% (Jan 2025, DataReportal; 7.19M users/10.9M population). Mobile: 83-87.57%. Distinction key for mobile-first AI, like DataKind’s 8MB Android coffee app.

1opu1uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1opu1uy/hot_water_tap_in_the_pantry/,Hot water tap in the pantry,"Hello hivemind. Our house has a pantry that at one time must have been a laundry, as it still has the long spout with hot/cold taps and separate hot and cold outlets beside it. As the fridge alcove backs into it, the cold outlet will end up being used for the supply when we get a fridge with an integrated water cooler.

However, I'm trying to figure out if there is an application for the hot water outlet, rather than just blocking it off. At the moment, the only use I can think is to fill the mop bucket. 

Does the community have any other ideas? Australia, if that makes a difference, there is already a dishwasher in the kitchen and none of us drink coffee, so an espresso or similar is probably not going to get used. ",1,1762419763.0,DIY,1,1.0,False

So… after spending most of 2023 feeling like a human energy bar running dangerously low on battery, I decided to test out the **Fit To Be Pregnant Plan** — a program tailored for soon-to-be moms (and yes, even curious non-moms like me can follow along).  

Fast forward 30 days later: **my energy levels didn’t just improve — they *tripled*.**  

I’m not exaggerating. I went from dragging myself out of bed at 8 AM to actually enjoying my morning walks *before* coffee. ☕️  

Here’s what made the difference, broken down so you can decide if it’s worth trying:  

---

**The Magic Formula (aka What Actually Worked)**  

- 🥗 **Better Fuel = Better Mood.** The plan focuses on nutrient-dense meals that keep your blood sugar stable. No crash, no brain fog. Just steady energy.  
- 🧠 **Mindful Routine.** There’s something powerful about pairing intention with small daily wins. The mini accountability check-ins alone made a huge difference.  
- 💪 **Exercise Reimagined.** It’s not about overdoing it—it’s about moving with purpose. Ten minutes a day turned into thirty because it *felt good*, not forced.  
- ☀️ **Soul Care, Not Just Self Care.** The plan encourages small, meaningful moments—like journaling or quiet breathing—that completely changed how I end my days.  

---

After 30 days, here were my biggest takeaways:  

- My mid-afternoon slumps disappeared.  
- I stopped reaching for sugar highs to ""boost"" focus.  
- I actually started *looking forward* to mornings.  

And listen, I’m not claiming this plan is magic—but something about the way it integrates energy, mindset, and balance is refreshingly practical.  

If anyone’s curious, this is the exact resource I followed ➡️ [Fit To Be Pregnant Plan eBook](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b).

1optzxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipgoals/comments/1optzxl/my_boyfriend_said_something_that_made_me_realize/,My boyfriend said something that made me realize I've been sabotaging our relationship for 2 years,"Last night my boyfriend (together 2.5 years) said something that completely broke my brain in the best way.

We were laying in bed and I was doing my usual scroll through couples' TikToks and Instagram reels (you know the ones - perfect proposals, romantic getaways, those aesthetic morning routines). He glanced over and said ""why do you watch other people's relationships more than you participate in ours?""

I got defensive at first but then it hit me. I literally spend HOURS watching other couples be happy. Their date nights. Their cute moments. Their anniversaries. Meanwhile, I'm anxious our relationship isn't ""goals"" enough, comparing us to every couple online.

He said something else that stuck: ""you're watching their highlight reel so much, you're missing our whole movie.""

So I did something that sounds absolutely unhinged but hear me out. I started recording little videos of US throughout the day. Nothing fancy, just:

* Him bringing me coffee in the morning saying ""your usual, my love""
* Me laughing at his terrible dad jokes
* Us cooking dinner together terribly off-key singing
* Him playing with my hair while we watch Netflix
* Our actual, real, unglamorous but perfect moments

Then (this is the weird part) I started watching those videos instead of other couples' content. Like literally replaced my algorithm with... us.

Y'all. The shift in my mental state has been insane. I'm not anxious about our relationship anymore. I'm not comparing us to anyone. I'm actually SEEING how good we have it. My brain finally gets it because I'm watching US be happy for hours instead of strangers.

But here's the plot twist - HE started doing it too. He has a whole folder of videos of me just existing. Doing my skincare. Ranting about work. Dancing while cooking. He watches them when he's at work and missing me.

Last night he said ""I used to watch random stuff on my breaks. Now I watch my favorite person. It's like I'm training my brain to love you more every day.""

I'm crying typing this. We're not perfect. We don't have the aesthetic apartment or matching outfits. But we've never been happier because we're finally watching our own love story instead of everyone else's.

If you're reading this while scrolling through couple goals content, maybe ask yourself: when's the last time you watched YOUR relationship be goals? Because I promise you, it already is. You're just watching the wrong channel.",10,1762419569.0,relationshipgoals,4,0.92,False

Now everytime I bleed, I write letters to myself for the next luteal phase with a list of what I really want. Example: Girl trust me on this, you want to stay in this appartement, don’t make decisions, wait for me. 
It helps with my habit of moving (I move every year because of pmdd and then regret it) now that I know I have no control over my thoughts. Same with relationships, jobs, studies. It helped me not to quit my master’s degree last month.

The month is cut in half, I feel cut in half and unfortunatly I can’t trust the other me, I can take care of her though. No more alcohol, less coffee, no more forgetting the magnesium and iron, and no more FOMO for the social event I decline for or during the danger weeks. I have to make sure she doesn’t get triggered (i have awful anxiety attacks during luteal).

Because I am healthier and she feels so lonely, I have to take care of her like a friend or a sister, and knowing she’ll forget about me, the only thing I ask of her is to read this piece of paper when in doubt and rest as much as possible. The letters are just monthly promesses and proofs that the suffering is temporary.

(I have a notebook for bad thoughts and one for these letters)

Then it started to progress from there. I had full on sore throat, runny nose, and my head hurting. I was convinced that it was just a common cold which I've had plenty before. I've been eating/drinking warm things since but late Wednesday my husband decided to buy us some snacks. I started to eat them and I realized that I could barely smell or taste anything. So I went through trials of smelling and tasting things throughout the house. I only could smell really potent things like nail polish but barely even that. I couldn't taste really much anything except the saltiness of my electrolyte juice. I decided to eat some coffee grounds and I could easily swallow that no problem without any taste. I went to the bathroom to number 2 and I couldn't smell anything at all whatsoever. Now it's early Thursday morning 330am to be exact and I'm having unwanted suicidal thoughts. I can't sleep and if I do it's only for 5 mins. My throat still feels funny but no burning, I'm having a bit of congestion and a cough. I popped some lozenges and I can taste them now but before I went to sleep I finished my chips and I could barely taste those before. So I'm really confused it feels like my taste is going in and out but my smell is blank. I've never had the thoughts of suicide as much as I do now that I'm dealing with this. I definitely don't feel like this is a common cold because I've never had to deal with no smell/taste before.  Also suicidal thoughts seem to be a new symptom for me but I don't know if it's a me thing or a new symptom from the ""COVID"" .

**\[NEWS ANALYSIS\]**  
   
Following a sluggish stretch in technological progress, Samsung Electronics looks to catch up with rivals Micron and SK hynix in next-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips. Signs point to renewed momentum: a hefty bonus for Samsung's HBM4 development team, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's encouraging remarks and Samsung's early ramp-up of HBM4 production all suggest a bright outlook for the Korean tech giant's memory business.  
   
Samsung’s latest HBM4 chips are currently undergoing verification testing by major client Nvidia — a crucial milestone that could determine its comeback in the high-end memory market. Although the fate of the high-performance memory for AI training chips largely hinges on Nvidia's adoption, sentiment around HBM4 is markedly more optimistic than it was for HBM3.  
   
Thirty members of Samsung’s memory division received a combined 5.1 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in company shares on Oct. 31, an unusual incentive move tied to their success in developing the company’s newest 10-nanometer-class 1c dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) process. This was the first time Samsung has granted treasury shares to developers, and also the first instance in which the company has officially disclosed the incentive. Industry watchers say the incentive signals positive feedback from Nvidia regarding Samsung’s HBM4 performance.

Nvidia chief Huang, during a press briefing in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Oct. 31, praised Korean companies’ memory technologies and described Samsung as a “key supply partner for HBM3E and HBM4” in a same-day statement announcing a major Blackwell processor supply deal. The recognition marks a turning point for Samsung, which previously struggled to secure Nvidia’s validation for its HBM3 and HBM3E products due to yield and quality challenges in its 1b process — an opening that allowed SK hynix to take the lead in the memory market.  
   
   
Both Samsung and SK hynix are expected to supply HBM4 chips for Nvidia’s next-generation Rubin processors, slated for mass production in the second half of 2026 — a timeline Huang confirmed during his remarks to the Korean press. KB Securities analyst Kim Dong-won projects Samsung’s HBM shipments could surge as much as fourfold by 2026, buoyed by orders for HBM3E and HBM4.  
   
The company is in the midst of converting the DRAM production lines at its latest plants in Pyeongtaek and Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, to 1c DRAM, to ""actively carry out investments necessary"" to expand production capacity, according to Kim Jae-june, Samsung Electronics' vice president in charge of memory chips, said at a conference call on Oct. 30.   
   
   
**Logic die yield points to mass production readiness**  
Adding to the optimism, reports indicate that Samsung’s foundry division has achieved a yield rate exceeding 90 percent for its 4-nanometer logic die — a critical component of the HBM4 architecture. The logic die, often described as the “brain” of the memory stack, connects the DRAM layers to the GPU and manages power distribution and data transmission in AI systems. A 90 percent yield suggests that 9 out of 10 chips are fully functional, implying that the process has matured enough for mass production.  
   


SK hynix's fifth-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM3E) is displayed at the chipmaker's booth for SK AI Summit held at Coex in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Nov. 3. \[YONHAP\]

   
As Samsung’s Suwon-based facilities ramp up HBM4 sample production for customers such as Nvidia and AMD, the company’s foundry division is said to have devoted nearly half of its 4-nanometer line capacity to logic die output, outlining its focus on next-generation memory components.  
   
By combining 1c DRAM and the 4-nanometer logic base die, Samsung could boost its HBM4 processing speeds to 11 gigabits-per-second (Gbps), higher than the 9-10 Gbps expected from SK hynix and Micron's HBM4 offerings, making its memory a better fit for Nvidia's Rubin chips.   
   
However, Samsung trails SK hynix by about two months in obtaining Nvidia’s approval, a delay that could reshape the HBM4 market outlook in both the short- and long-term. SK hynix is expected to take the early lead, benefiting from first-mover advantage in production volume and pricing power. Over the longer term, analysts project that Samsung will rapidly gain market share as its technology matures and production capacity scales up.

“As new HBM4 supply comes online, competition among vendors will intensify. Ultimately, the market could settle with SK hynix holding around a 50 percent share, Samsung a 30 percent share and Micron a 20 percent share.” Kiwoom Securities analyst Pak Yu-ak said.   
   
   
**Chip supercycle seen extending through 2027**  
Analysts expect the ongoing semiconductor upcycle to persist through 2027, despite mounting speculation of an AI-driven market correction. In a sign of confidence, Korean brokerages are shifting their valuation frameworks for chipmakers from price-to-book (PBR) to price-to-earnings (PER) ratios — a recognition that the memory business may now be entering a phase of more stable, structural growth.  
   
SK Securities set target prices of 1 million won for SK hynix — a record-high figure — and 170,000 won for Samsung Electronics, both based on earnings multiples for the first time. Traditionally, the cyclic nature of memory markets made book value a more dependable metric than volatile earnings, but analysts say the paradigm is changing.

“It’s time to ask whether PBR is still the right yardstick for valuing memory chipmakers in the AI era,” said Han Dong-hee, analyst at SK Securities. “As profits stabilize and long-term structural growth continues, the logic for using PBR will weaken.”  
   
Han added that tight production capacity among major players is expected to sustain higher prices in the coming years.  
   
Market tracker CTT Research echoed the sentiment, forecasting that demand for DRAM and NAND chips will continue to outpace supply amid robust AI infrastructure investment and expanding data center buildouts. “Despite a few risk factors, the memory market is expected to stay in a favorable cycle at least through the first half of next year,” the report said Wednesday.

### Step 2: Pick Your Container
Who says it has to be a basket? Think outside the box!
*   **Classic:** A wicker or rattan basket.
*   **Modern:** A sleek wooden crate or a sturdy storage bin.
*   **Usable:** A mixing bowl (for a baker), a cute planter (for a gardener), or a stocking (for a traditional feel).
*   **Unique:** A galvanized bucket, a decorative gift box, or even a slow cooker for a foodie!

### Step 3: Select Your Fillers & Gift Items
Aim for a mix of items: one or two ""star"" gifts, several smaller supporting items, and something to create volume. We'll get into tons of ideas below, but a good rule of thumb is an odd number of items (3, 5, 7) for a visually pleasing arrangement.

### Step 4: Add the Finishing Touches
Presentation is everything!
*   **Filler:** Use crinkle-cut paper shred, burlap, faux snow, or even tea towels to create a base and lift your items.
*   **Wrap:** Use clear cellophane and tie it with a big, beautiful ribbon on top.
*   **Tag:** Don't forget a handwritten gift tag with a warm, personal message.

## Pro Tips for Assembling a Show-Stopping Basket

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20baskets)

*   **Create Height:** Place the tallest item in the back or center. Arrange items in a pyramid shape so everything is visible.
*   **Use a Color Scheme:** Sticking to 2-3 colors (e.g., red, green, and gold) makes the basket look cohesive and intentional.
*   **Secure Items:** Use double-sided tape or floral wire to keep items from shifting, especially if you're using cellophane.
*   **Don't Forget the Consumables:** Edible items or things that get ""used up"" (like candles or bath bombs) are always a hit because they don't create clutter.
*   **Start Early!** The best time to start gathering items is late October or early November to avoid the holiday rush and ensure you can find everything you want.

1optniu,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1optniu/how_to_improve_reflux_in_newbornsbabies/,How to improve reflux in newborns/babies,"I wanted to share my experience with my baby's reflux. 

My newborn starred having awful reflux at around 2 weeks which led to inconsolable crying for hours, arching, inability to make her fall asleep etc.

She is now 6 weeks old (almost 7) and I can confidently say her reflux is 99% gone. I wanted to share my experience with reddit community as reddit was what helped me gain wisdom and knowledge.  

What I learned and implemented:
- mom's diet is everything. Just as if you're drinking too much coffee during pregnancy can induce reflux in the pregnancy, diet, similarly, impact the content and the taste of breast milk and can trigger reflux in newborns. I heavily watched for my diet.I removed any possible trigger from it: and the acidic foods like tomatoes, spices, caffeine. I only ate oatmeal or chia pudding for breakfast, fish with caraway seeds for lunch with quinoa or rice and some non gas inducing veggies (carrots, sweet potatoes, etc- avoid broccoli 🥦 and cauliflower for a while). I know this is a difficult oke for a lot of new parents but I removed any cafe from my diet and exchanged it for chicory coffee.
- caraway seeds. I consulted my european friends who told me that it's accustomed for moma in Europe to eat caraway seeds in their diet. I later also learned that it's  very common in middle eastern cultures. Not sure if there's any science behind it, but I read somewhere that they contain a compound that helps with reflux and gastrointestinal issues in children. I sprinkled them on everything and with every meal.
- baby positioning. I was extremely vigilant and consistent about a few things when it comes to baby positioning. First, making sure the baby is held upright after each ferd for at least 45min, if she was in pain even for an hour. That's what you could be sure that most of the breast milk was digested before laying baby down. In addition to this every time I put baby down into her playgym or into her bassinet, her head was elevated (I used props and for bassinet books under it). If it's difficult for you to hold a baby for that long.I would recommend putting a baby into a carrier especially in case they have a delayed burping like mine). 
- burping and movement- i would always make sure that my baby is burped several times during feeding and if she had a hard time burping I would try to walk with her up and down stairs (somehow it expedites burping) or we would go on walks in the neighborhood so her belly is gently moving. This would help additional burping and also help her pass gas.
- gas drops. We also used gas drops (Little Remedies has the most natural ingredients) after each feed initially- religiously at the beginning but now only when she has problems passing gas. 

This is, of course, my experience but I wanted to share it in case this might be helpful to others and it might help their babies. I was told by numerous friends that the only way to overcome newborn reflux is to wait it out until the baby can sit up or to go on meds. I just couldn't see my baby suffer and couldn't imagine witnessing her pain for that long or risking the side effects of medications. So I asked around mamas in many different cultures and also checked various forums and scientific articles. Or course YMMV but it might be worth trying.If you have a baby who's suffering from reflux and is in pain all the time.",1,1762418181.0,newborns,1,1.0,False

Ever feel like that corner office is starting to look more like a cage than a castle? Been dreaming of swapping spreadsheets for... well, *anything* else?

Let's be real, the thought of finally kicking back and relaxing after decades of hustle is AMAZING. But let's also be honest – just sitting around doing *nothing* can get old real quick. Like, *really* quick.

That's where hobbies come in, folks. Think of them as your post-career superpowers. And guess what? They're often cheaper than those hour-long therapy sessions! 😜

Seriously, hobbies can be a total game-changer. Here's why I think they're so crucial for rocking retirement:

*   **Keeps the mind sharp:** Think puzzles, learning a new language (Hola, world!), or even mastering the art of competitive birdwatching.
*   **Boosts that social battery:** Remember actually *talking* to people face-to-face? Join a book club, a gardening group, or (my personal favorite) a cornhole league! Trading stories and laughs is the best medicine.
*   **Gives you a reason to get out of bed (besides coffee):** Seriously, having something you're genuinely excited about makes all the difference. Painting, woodworking, volunteering...the possibilities are endless!
*   **Rediscovering that ""you"" you kinda forgot:** We all get lost in our careers. Retirement is your chance to reconnect with passions you put on the back burner years ago. Did you always want to write a novel? Learn to play guitar? Now's your time to shine!

I was chatting with my neighbor, Stan (retired accountant, bless his soul), the other day. He confessed he was feeling a little lost after leaving his job. He missed the structure, the challenge, the... *numbers*. But then he discovered a local chess club. Now he's not only crushing it on the chessboard, but he's also made a whole new group of friends. Who knew Stan had such killer checkmate skills?!

And speaking of killer skills, what if you could even *monetize* those new hobbies? Turn your woodworking into Etsy store gold, or become a dog-walking pro!

We believe in strongest people. And if you are ready to find your passion, or just looking for awesome deals on hobby supplies, you might like this: [https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb)

So, what are *you* thinking of diving into? What's that hidden passion just waiting to be unleashed? Are you already rocking some seriously awesome retirement hobbies? Share your stories! Let's inspire each other!

1optddd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1optddd/aitah_for_ignoring_my_disabled_coworker_after_she/,AITAH for ignoring my disabled coworker after she became aggressive toward my friend?,"I (28F) have been working an administrative role at my company for just under 10 years. The coworker in question, who we’ll call A (24F) has held a part-time position in my same department for 6 months. 

I wasn’t involved in her hiring and, to be honest, I still don’t really understand what her job is meant to be. I’ve asked head office, and all I’ve been told is that she’s “assisting” the team. But in practice, she mostly floats around (tidying breakroom drawers, wiping down tables, and occasionally bringing people coffee) When she’s not doing that, she’s usually standing right beside me.

At first, I assumed she’d been paired with me for training, so I tried to show her the ropes: how to file reports, how our database works, how to log customer issues, etc. But she’d quickly lose interest, give vague answers, or say she “doesn’t know” and then start showing me photos of her dogs. I wanted to do my best to accomodate her, so I tried again, multiple times, to get her involved, thinking she might just need patience or extra support. I even scheduled a full day to train her one-on-one, but nothing stuck.

 All she is willing to do is stand right beside me or the earlier mentioned tasks. She’s a sweet girl, and I did genuinely like her for a time, but an office full of overworked, under-paid staff doesn’t feel like it’s the right environment for her.

Truth be told, I have no idea what exactly her condition is, nor the entirety of what it entails, but I’ve gathered that she has some kind of developmental disability. From observation I  know that she has speech issues (tends to speak extremely quietly, stutter, and struggles to find words), seems to have a learning delay (things must be explained to her 3+ times before she understands) and has a caregiver to drop her off and pick her up. 
We settled into routine for a little while, and she was happy enough to just sit there quietly stapling papers for me, or most of the time, hanging out in the break room. It was nice to have some company in my cubical for a bit.

However, things started getting strange after she began following me everywhere. to the copy room, to the breakroom, even waiting for me in the lobby after my shift. She never crossed any physical boundaries, but it was definitely unsettling. I tried to set gentle boundaries (“Hey, I just need a bit of space to finish this,” etc.), but she’d just smile, giggle, and keep hovering.

Now, here’s where the real issue begins. 

I have a close friend (28F) who we’ll call M. M and I went to school together, and have known each other for nearly our entire lives. It just so happens that M works as a barista at the café in our lobby. We see each other most days when I grab lunch, and if we finish work around the same time, we’ll sometimes take the train home together.

At first, A started joining me at lunch. Not much talking, but I think she just enjoyed the company, or wanted someone familiar to sit with. But when she began noticing how close M and I were, her behaviour shifted drastically. She began glaring at M from across the bench when we’d go up to order, ignoring her greetings, or making faces at her. 

I brushed it off at first, thinking maybe she was somewhat jealous or just didn’t understand boundaries in friendships, but things quickly escalated. Once, when M came to drop off my coffee, A hissed at her, actually hissed, like a cat. M just handed me the coffee and left awkwardly without saying anything. I pulled A aside afterward and asked her what that was about, and she just shrugged before walking away. Things calmed afterwards, and I brushed the whole thing off as some kind of weird fluke.

The breaking point came about a week later, during lunch in the cafe. M walked past our table to deliver someone’s food, and A spat toward her. Not directly on her, but close enough that it landed on the floor beside her, before hissing again. I went straight to HR that afternoon and explained everything as carefully as I could. I felt awful about reporting her, but I really didn’t know what else to do. I told them I was worried that A didn’t understand appropriate boundaries, and that her behavior toward another employee was becoming aggressive. They said they’d “look into it,” but weeks went by and nothing happened.

M, being far too kind, refused to press charges but called me later that night crying.

Since then, I’ve kept my distance from A. I stopped sitting with her at lunch, and if I see her coming toward me, I find something else to do or somewhere else to be. I even lock my door when I’m working late because she’s shown up uninvited before, just standing outside the glass wall waiting for me to finish. I did try once more to sit her down and talk calmly, to tell her that what she did wasn’t okay and that she couldn’t treat people like that, but she didn’t take it seriously. She just sat there refusing to speak and crossing her arms.

I feel like it’s fair to want something to be done, but I don’t know if she even understands fully whats going on, or if I’m treating her unfairly because of her disability. 

I really don’t want to be cruel. I get that she has challenges and that some of this behavior might come from that, but there has to be a line somewhere. So, AITAH?",2,1762417066.0,AITAH,2,0.75,False
