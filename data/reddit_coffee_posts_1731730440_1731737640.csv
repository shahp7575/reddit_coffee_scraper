The florescent lights buzzed overhead as I plopped my purse on my desk. The smell of dust and stale coffee permeated the air as a stale box of donuts lay on the desk beside me, attracting flies. The suns last rays set in the horizon, making the changing leaves glow. I longed to take a walk ouside and beath the cool crisp air, but it would be dark soon and I had to clock in.  

“Do you have any plans for Halloween,” said Rob, my coworker. “We’re taking the kids out to trunk or treat out at our church meet up on Sunday.”

I put my head down and rolled my eyes. “Samhain, I celebrate Samhain, and I’ve taken off the last week of October,” I said under my breath. I was stuck in this dreary office and time couldn't pass fast enough, and here was Mr. Family man asking me to cover for him.

“What?”

“I’m taking off next week, I have other plans,” I said.

“So you can’t cover my shift on Sunday? The kids were looking forward to trunk or treat.”

“Ask Dave, he practically lives here, he’ll take your shift if he hasn’t already.”  

“I would but Dave is out for the weekend.”

""Rob, I've already picked up a shift for you last week, please check the shedule for someone else, this holiday is important to me.""  My hands curled into fists and I gritted my teeth, the nerve of some coworkers.

The loading ticker showed on my desk, taking a full five minutes to log in. 

:Ericka! It’s great to see you. Got anything planned, bestie?:

I smiled at Angie’s message, ah at least some conversation to break up the monotony of my shift tonight.

:Yeah, I’m going to hang out with some friends, did you want to come out with us?:

:I wish I could , but I’m working overtime tomorrow, then I have to pack up.:

:Well, I hope you have fun.:

:I will.:

Sometimes I wish I had more time in the day. Angie and I would spend time in between calls and projects to joke or complain about the system crashing. However , working on night shift crushed most plans for hanging out. Nothing was open after we got off work except for the emergency room and truck stops. I also commuted forty minutes to work and back and ended up staying home on my days off. Perhaps when I got back from vacation I’d make more time to spend with them, attend group functions. Who am I kidding? Then I’d have to spend time with Rob and his family as well, yikes. No, when I returned I would treat Angie out for coffee, just hang out at Starbucks down the road. Anything to break the monotony.

I sighed and went back to reading my email. Kale666@gmail, jumped out in red letters. It was obvious spam, but they weren’t wrong, kale is the devil. 

As soon as i clicked delete the screen tuned a sickly yellow hue and the letters turned blood red. The words became mangled and began to melt down the screen.

I swore under my breath, there was a virus embedded into this demonic salad. Now I had to call IT, all to have some condescending jaskass mansplain to me about clicking outside emails or remote into my sytem. Right when I was about to dial the overhead lights dimmed before winking out into darkness, along with my phone and computer.

A flashlight glowed as a few security guards came to check out the breaker room. 

“We’ll get the generator back up in no time, you guys sit tight, ” said Ralph.  The kindly old man was the the head security guard. With him stood Jarvis, a laid back security guard that held the flashlight.

Another loud hum and the generator kicked up, shoving a plume of dark smoke into the air. 

“We're having an electrical outage. I’m going to need y’all to move to building two,"" said Ralph.

I sighed, very well, I would pack my stuff and play musical cubicles until they got the problem resolved. Hopefully I’d be able to log into my phone and complete my before the night ended. The lights flashed again as Ralph grumbled.

We packed up our things to move to the building next door. This night couldn’t end soon enough, but at least I’d be off for the week after my shift.

I tried to turn my computer on one last time to sign out, this time the screen lit up black with blood red drips of code oozing down the page. Random letters filling out the word ZALGO. Zalgo? I remembered hearing about Zalgo as some internet boogeyman, some dark god that infected coding.

Ralph let out an agonizing scream as his his body floated in in the air.  I froze as a spindly figure slammed him repeatedly against the floor. He screamed until his voice became wet gurgles. The creature tossed against the wall, leaving a trail of blood as he slid down. 

""GET OUT!"" I screamed at the creature as I pushed all my will at it.  I was terrified, but also angry that this creature, this bug would dare terrorize me at my work.  Oh, this was on like donky kong.

The spindly creature screamed and unnatural high pitched sound before fading into the wall.  Pressure surrounded me and the air grew freezing. My breath came out in cold puffs against the dimming florecent lights. Rob coward under his desk, whispering the lords prayer, I knelt down becide him. 

""This has to be a dream, some nightmare.  I'm going to wake up next to my wife in a few minutes,"" his eyes were desperate and gleaming with tears.

""I'm afraid not.  We're going to have to dig our heels in and fight.  The only way out of this is through-""

""What are you talking about?""

""Long story, I'll explain later we don't have time.""

“I’m going to need y’all to stay down!” said Jarvis. His laid back demeanor changed, his eyes became hard as he crouched and explored the territory, he held out a taser in front of him. 

His radio made a static garbled sound as the lights flickered around us. Jarvis walked along side the wall, nervously glancing at the perimeter. I curled under my desk, numb from shock. 

Movement flashed in the inky blackness, and I crawled under the desk next to Rob.  A shadow in the darkness out of the corner of my eye that would slip back into the shadows when I looked at it head on.

All I wanted was a day off, I had put in weeks of overtime to have this vacation and this thing was not going to take it away from me. I needed to find Jarvis , pull the fire alarm and run the hell out of dodge. Let the authorities or a priest deal with this. What happened to Ralph was horrible and I would not let that happen to anyone else. I wasn’t about to sit around and play victim to this thing.

I inched carefully towards Robs desk, and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around and bear hugged me so tight the air was knocked out of me. 

“I have a wife and kids. Oh God, what did I do to deserve any of this?”

""Dude, I can't breath.""

He released his grip on me as the air rushed back into my lungs.

“Sorry,” he said.

“It’s fine. The second thing I need you to do is to stop panicking. I have a plan to escape, but we’re going to have to find Jarvis.”

“But he’s security, he can handle himself-”

“Not against this thing.” I reached in my shirt and pulled out my pentacle. “I’ve worked with spirits before, most are harmless but this bug is malevolent. It's time for me to crack the Raid out.”

“Are you sure you know what you’re doing?”

“I have no clue, but I’d rather improvise a plan and risk getting out of here alive than giving up. You have faith, you'll need it. Hang on to it, it’ll be the one thing that grounds yourself against it.”

From my experiances in ghost hunting and research, malignant spirits fed on those with little direction or sense of self. That’s why faith banished them, it was you calling in on your higher self, hell, even an athiest could banish it if they had enough belief in themselves and the solid world around them, just replace “may the power of Christ compel you with , ‘you won’t ruin my reality’.” For me it was ""I reject your reality and substitute it with my own!"" bad choice of works in fact checking or politics, but golden in fighting malevolent spirits.

I held my breath as I crept along the edge of the office wall, the creature flitting through the shadows, just out of my sight. The coward was avoiding me, perhaps escape was going to be easy. Jarvis was standing at the corner, his gun pointed and his eyes scanning the area. A dark inky shadow slipped away,  the hum growing  louder as the office went from pitch black to a sickly yellow light.

“Jarvis?”

He turned around, his gun trained on me, I raised my hands in submission.

“Erika! I told you and Rob to remain in place!”

“I know.”

Jarvis lowered his gun and took a deep breath. “What the hell is going on?”

“This is going to sound a little woo woo, but what we’re not up against a human intruder-”

“I’m gonna tell you something, this place was always a bit off, especailly at night. But I didn’t say nothing, as long as the bills were paid. So what if the lights occasionally flickered or the computers froze, that’s normal night shit, right? Tell me why they hired a security guard when they need a motherfucking exorsist or some shit?”

“I am an exorcist.  Well, at least I am for my coven.”

“You can fight this thing?  You saw what it did to Ralph?”

“ The worst thing you can do right now is panic and feed this thing energy. That’s why I need you to calm down.”

Jarvis stared at me blankly, I my reflection gleamed in his dark eyes, and behind me a shadow crept. I rushed to his other side and the being skittered away. 

“It's afraid of me,” I said.

Rob slowly walked from around the corner. 

“All right. Everyone is accounted for, treat it like an active shooter drill. We need ot reach the door,” I said.

The lights flickered off and we ran towards the exit door at the end of the office, only to find it locked.

Jarvis grabbed my hand and I grabbed Robs as we made it toward the other door only to find that it was also locked. 

“Oh come on! Out of every trope possible!” I punched the door with my hand only to yelp and shake the pain out of my knuckles.

“So what do we do now?” asked Rob. His eyes pleading for help.

“The only thing I can do, fight it.”

We ran down to the break room, the lights flashed on and off before we got there. I led them through the door slamming it behind me. I found the salt shakers and salt packets and poured out a rough circle. Dizzyness hit me like a wave and the pressure dropped so fast that both of my ears popped.  Shadows formed into a long spindly creature, like it was shoved together out of old coat hangers and ink. It reached through the door and cried when it hit the salt. 

Rob clutched his cross pendent as Jarvis aimed his gun.

“Don’t shoot, it won’t do any good. Rob keep praying.” I grabbed a handful of salt packets. “I’m going , if I don't come back, call Mark and tell him that I love him.” I handed Jarvis my phone, my husband’s contact information on the front page.

“You can’t lay that on me, let me go with you.” Jarvis aimed toward the window, awaiting the creature to return.

“I need you to stay with Rob.” I opened the door and walked out into the office. The lights returned to a sickly yellow and the screams became more distant. Whatever this thing was, it didn't want to deal with me. It wanted the men and I prayed to Gaia that the salt was enough to repel it.

The creature screamed , it clicked like nails on a chalkboard. I tried each of the doors, all of them locked. The hallway seemed like a maze of doorways and florescent lights. I tried each door, jiggling each handle to no avail. Until I reached the stairway at the end of the hall, that doorway opened with little problem.

The sky ungulated with purple and blue swirls though the windows. Another wave of dizziness hit me as I climbed the stairs toward the top floor. The spindly creacher crouched at the stairway, leaning like a praying mantise, it’s eyes peering at me . It screached again and lept up to the top floor.

I chased after it, the lights flickering on behind me as I chased it. I honestly had no idea what I would do if I caught up to it. A salt packet certainly wasn’t going to kill it and I had no weapon. I regretted not listening to Jarvis. 

I went to the empty breakroom by roof in our building. I rummaged through all the cabinets but all I found was a plastic spoon and a couple of trays. 

Lightning flashed revealing the monster couched in praying mantis form, a portal swirling behind it. Perhaps that was were it came from, why it chose to attack an office in night shift was beyond me. 

I walked out onto the roof and the wind started to blow. The creature lunged for me but I ducked back. I threw some salt in its direction and it shrieked at me. I felt the ground beneath my feet. I was going to go on vacations, this creature was not going to ruin it for me. 

Two gunshots fired and the creature screamed. Jarvis stood in the doorway his gun in perfect aim with the creature. 

“I told you not to come in here!”

“Ericka, I need you to stay back-”

“It’s non corporeal-”

Jarvis began to float in the air, the creature taking control of his body.. 

“I am the daughter of Gia, the Daughter of the Hecate and Morrigan!” 

The creature shrieked and Jarvis dropped to the ground. Rob followed confidently behind him, holding the cross out in front of him. 

“Down into the ground and among the roots, out of our leaves and shoots. Leave as all be, you have no power over me!” I chanted.

The swirling clouds overhead were pierced by bright sunlight. The creature leapt at Jarvis but Rob and I stood in it’s way, forming a wall between it and the security guard.

Full sunlight hit the creature and it screamed one last time before turning into a pile of dust beneath our feet. And we both fell, exhausted in the morning sun.

I walked into back into the breakroom to find all the lights back on in their pale, florescent glory. The doors once again opened and I followed the stairs down. Ralph’s lifeless body lie on the first floor. But it was no longer mangled, but still and cold. Jarvis called 911 and soon  sirens sounded in the background.

“You saved my life,” said Jarvis. “You both did.”

“What do we tell the police when they show up?"" asked Rob.

“That there was a power outage and Ralph had a medical emergency. That’s what the coverup will be.” I sighed.

“How did you know what to do?” 

""It's a long story.""

Long story indeed. I managed to defeat this creature easily, but who sent it?  The beast wasn't intelligent enough to come up with it's own plan.  Someone set it on us, and I sat thinking of everyone I could have offended.  A customer would have no idea who I was outside of work, so that idea was out. Perhaps it had nothing to do with me, and it was some lover's quarrel or someone upset and wanting vengence on their boss.  

To cover my bases I took a salt shaker and sprinkled them around the building.  I thought of a steel wall covering the office building.  I hoped it was enough of a ward to last until I returned to work next week.""  I would stay for a few more hours and answer questions from the authorities. My work had better pay me overtime for this. 

My vacation couldn't come fast enough, I wanted to go hiking on a mountain pass far from phones and civilization.  You best believe Mark was driving me out there after the night I've had.",1,1731737406.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Let’s take a stroll down memory lane. Back in 2011, I watched this absolute cinematic masterpiece called *The Roommate*. It was about a psycho roommate who, for reasons unknown, decided that murder was a perfectly acceptable way to express her *clinginess.* A real feel-good flick. Anyway, it got me thinking: we've all had our own roommate horror stories. The campus recently paired us up with randoms (good luck with that), so here’s a rundown of the kinds of people you’ve probably had as roommates, or still do, for some reason.

# 1. The Goody Two-Shoes Church Guy

This one’s a piece of work. He wakes up at the crack of dawn—like, 4 AM—and starts serenading the walls with some *Kumbaya* hymns. He bangs on the walls, talks in tongues, and somehow *always* has an opinion about how you're living your life. ""You’re listening to *that* music? You know the devil's in the details, right?"" Yeah, dude, and you're the one who’s waking me up at ungodly hours with your holy ghost choir. Who appointed you the Pope of this dorm?

# 2. The Ghost Roomie

You met them when they moved in, dropped off a bunch of suitcases, and... *poof*. They vanish like a mirage. They pop in every two weeks to check if their bed is still there (spoiler: it is), but you don’t even know their name. At this point, you're starting to wonder if you’re rooming with a real person, or if this is just some elaborate prank by the universe. *Do they even exist?*

# 3. The Nerd

These creatures don’t ""live"" in your room—they *occupy* it. They’re surrounded by an empire of textbooks, handouts, and dead dreams. Their bed? Buried under so many academic papers it might as well be a mausoleum. Occasionally, a classmate will pop by to photocopy their soul-crushing assignments. Honestly, if they ever looked up from their books, I think they’d forget what humans look like. Or maybe they'd be too busy solving Fermat’s Last Theorem while memorizing Pi to care.

# 4. The Casanova

This guy has a revolving door of women in and out of your room like he’s running an illegal dating app. You’re trying to do your laundry, but nope, here comes another fresh face asking, “Is your roommate home?” No, he’s off breaking hearts and making questionable life choices in the name of ""love."" At this point, you’ve probably seen him more with his revolving cast of love interests than with his own clothes on.

# 5. The Freak

This one’s me, by the way. I’m the quiet weirdo in the corner, headphones in, blasting *Gothic metal* so loud that even the neighbors can feel it in their souls. I rarely leave the room, and if I do, it’s after dark. Don’t try to talk to me before noon unless you’re offering me coffee or an existential crisis. My social life is like a rare Pokémon—you may never see it, but it *does* exist... somewhere.

# 6. The Chief

This guy is like a magnet for people—specifically, *his people*. Suddenly, you’re not just sharing a room. You're hosting a tribal council. He brings his squad, aka ""his tribe,"" and they start talking in some alien dialect that sounds suspiciously like they’re planning a coup. They're laughing, yelling, and you’re sitting there trying to remember if you’ve committed any crimes worthy of this kind of punishment. Meanwhile, you’re just the extra in a sitcom about social anxiety. *Do I even exist in this room anymore?*

# 7. The Green-Eyed Monster

This is your classic copycat. At first, they act like your best friend. Then, without warning, they start ""borrowing"" your style, your friends, your *vibe*. Suddenly, you wake up to find your girlfriend is now his girlfriend, and your entire friend group is off making inside jokes that you’re not a part of anymore. You're left wondering: *When did I become the extra in my own life?* You’re the original, and somehow, they’re wearing your identity like a new hoodie.

# 8. The BMS Graduate

This guy knows *everything*. If you want to know where to party, who’s got the good weed, or who’s throwing a rave at 3 AM—he’s your guy. He’s got the inside track on every event happening on campus, but 90% of the time, he’s drunker than a fish. If you’re looking for advice on where to get your hands on something *questionable* or want to know where the best afterparty is, this guy’s got your back—*as long as you’re willing to ignore the fact that he’s perpetually hungover*.

# 9. Mr. Know-It-All

This guy is basically a walking Wikipedia of unsolicited opinions. He’ll tell you that the moon landing was faked, your favorite food is secretly toxic, and that the government is listening to your thoughts through your fridge. He knows everything—*EVERYTHING*. He can even tell you what you had for breakfast last week, including that time you ate 3-day-old pizza and regretted it. Honestly, I’m waiting for the day he tells me he knows what color socks I’m wearing *right now*.

# And finally...

**The Guy Who Cooks Omena.** We all hate him. But he’s probably your best friend now, because you’ve come to terms with the fact that the smell will haunt you for the next *four years*.

And there you have it. My two cents on the bizarre, wonderful, and occasionally traumatic world of roommates. And remember: never trust atoms. They make up everything. 😜",1,1731737316.0,Kenya,0,1.0,False

He gave my mom psychological trauma so she wasn’t really much of a motherly figure because of her own problems she faced with my father but they didn’t get divorced until I was about to turn 17. 

Disciplinary methods from my father during times I’ve fucked up mostly consisted of military boot type punishments. Pushups being yelled at, crying kept me in push-up position longer, etc.. 

As i grew, lectures began to follow. He explained and elaborated the situation and more details. As this continued throughout my teen years, the lectures continued on. Sometimes he would try to get my response or feedback. However anytime I tried to give my two piece, it gets shut down. There is always a right or wrong answer when it came to responding. I had bad anger issues and anxiety when I was in my teens. Always fucking up due to the ADHD I wasn’t diagnosed with until I was 20. Constant fuck ups led to constant punishments and lectures which led to more anger and anxiety buildup as well as low self confidence and social anxiety. Due to this, I didn’t have friends in high school and was always alone and felt alone. I felt small. I felt unheard. So much to express but never had the opportunity to express it. I’ve seen many different therapists in my teens. None have helped me in any way. This is likely because I tend to curve around the real problems in my head and speak of general life events. 

While my mom was never somebody I could talk to, I knew I couldn’t talk to my dad about my mental health issues, as I would expect it to be useless and he would continue to brush off my emotions as something so minor. This led to more buildup of the anger and anxiety and I would end up inflicting physical damage to myself to deal with it because I did not know how to deal with it in a proper manner. My parents always hated each other but chose to stay together for the kids. Putting on a ‘happy family’ facade in public when we would go out and do things.
One key thing I still remember that made me realize that he really isn’t someone I can trust is when I was around 11-13 on the 4th of July, having fun and being a kid. I willingly handed him my iPod and asked him to take pictures and videos of the firecrackers. He had it for a while and then handed it back to me, telling me that it didn’t work. I opened it up to check my camera and then noticed a bunch of my apps in the tab bar. Killed my mood instantly. 

The only reason my parents got divorced was because my dad was seeing a new woman who he wanted to pursue relationship-wise. She was a bad narcissist too and both of them combined was intense. 

At some points I knew they were planning out my punishments and when id get in trouble because id fuck up so much that they manipulated my patterns. One event was so bad, my stepmom put a knife to my throat threatening me and then both of them were talking mad shit. Making me feel bad about myself, a key statement being an appraisal towards my brother whom they labeled the ‘prodigy son’. At one point months later, me being forgetful because of that undiagnosed adhd (not an excuse) led to an even bigger event. They prioritized that but would also leak in other rants and thoughts that seemed to make me look bad. Eventually it got worse when I forgot to turn the washer on that same day so they went off on me more. The next day, they had to run errands and made me stand in the front yard where the camera was to monitor me because they didn’t want me in the house. This is when I knew I was over it and I simply walked away and managed to find my way to my hometown which was 3hrs away to my moms home  

 Left the dad and stepmom and went to live with my mom. This was probably the most at peace I’ve felt. I still struggled a lot mentally but I felt better. Started college, working all day and stacking my money good. Mom and her man are chill asf. A year later. My dad, his wife, and all the kids come to my workplace to see me. This is how they try to slowly creep back into my life. My dad would then occasionally visit me to get coffee and talk. Then one day, he approaches me about an opportunity. Stepmom retiring from military so I’m eligible to get monthly stipends from the VA for being in college. Sounded good to me. But he made sure to highlight the part that *im only eligible for it if I live with the veteran* which is not true. Ignorant me fell for it because “free money” and I moved back with them. 

Which wasn’t horrible but I still got a bad vibe from them. Eventually I continued to workout and dirty bulked because they would shit on me for being skinny. Telling me I look sick. That I look like I was on hard drugs. But then wanting to mention me getting fat once I finally gained weight. Anyways things were fine until Jan 2024 where things took a much wild turn. 

I’ve realized that the way I grew up did affect me as an adult. Especially with my other relatives and my inability to communicate with them when they are trying to help me. I know my problem and I’m sure this is the root cause. Taking the steps to improve it is what I want to learn how to do. Self awareness is a key element in the process of recovering. The more I delve deep into my past, I can understand and dissect it but even then, I still do not understand. I know this is not something I can continue to let affect me the older I get. Such damage received from the past is very difficult to overcome but I know I need to overcome it. I am just unsure of what the next steps are. ",1,1731736613.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Ive recently had to break the news to my coworker that im in a relationship and he is taking some space and this has triggered some serious thinking. Idk if its because the loss of a friend or if actually liked him more than i wanted to admit.

Few key notes: 

-BF and I just recently became official, and he lives across the ocean with a 7 hr time difference. We met spontaneously early in the summer while i was on a trip and hes the sweetest. I feel extremely safe and comfortable around him and never felt like this before. Hes traveled to me twice since meeting and i traveled to him once so far. 

Coworker: We dont directly work with one another and so i would see him only when i took my breaks. When i did, we both smile and can tell were happy to see one another. Always greet one another and mutually looked forward to seeing one another. I think we both heavily reciprocated each others energy and so we both were bubbly with one another. Initially i thought it was cutesy friendship until he asked for my number (even tho he said casual) and then admitted to having a crush on me. Fast fwd, we have a coffee outing and talk for hours and at the end i said id like to remain friends, i mentioned the EU guy and how i plan on moving out of state so i view a lot of things here as temporary. 

There was about 2 more attempts of my coworker asking me out while i thought it should remain friendly so each time ive politely declined but previously said i cared about his feelings and didn’t think it would be ok to see two people at once. Now things have gone official he is really hurting.

I miss seeing him at work and already asked if it was an all or nothing deal and he needs time to think about this because its making him uneasy. I apologized and said everything i mentioned to him about our friendship and connection was true but want him to do what makes him feel his best. 

Idk how long we’ll go without talking or seeing eachother. I think about what ifs, was it really a friendship or not. I feel like i have very conflicting feelings and not sure what to do.",2,1731736492.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I am barely getting into making espresso and my Breville bambino is coming in the mail. I have no knowledge of how a proper espresso is made. I am upgrading from a Nespresso machine. Would it be ok for me to just use the grinder at the grocery stores to grind my beans there? How necessary is it? I was looking at the Baratza Encore ESP as I was told that is the most decent grinder for the lowest price. I did not realize a grinder would cost just as much or more as an espresso machine itself. I can buy it, but if somebody out there can tell me that it's not 100% necessary as a amateur espresso maker then I will either use my cheap 15$ grinder from Amazon or just grind the coffee with the store coffee grinder 😬😬😬 if yall think it's absolutely worth it and will make my coffee taste amazing then I will spend the 200$!",1,1731736386.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

• Coffee date last Thursday
• Coffee date + group hike last Sunday (we have a common group)
• Run Monday

During our Sunday/Monday dates, we talked about spending the night camping in the alps and she seemed excited about it. Throughout the week, the camping downgraded to a hike because she was missing some gear and couldn’t get any friends to lend it to her (she had warned me about this Sunday). 

Finally, last night she texted me this:

« I am super sorry but could we maybe do that another day? Cause I forgot that I wanted to go to (city name) to get some stuff from my old room mates. I am sorry, this week is a bit chaotic 😅 »

Wasn’t too sure what to reply so I just said « no worries ».

My take is she isn’t interested anymore, else she would have proposed some other day correct ?

Stings a little because we got along quite well, she showed some effort to see me at first and I actually kind of liked her, but I don’t want to be an option and waste my time.

1gsgf0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gsgf0n/bad_roommate_finally_gone/,Bad Roommate FINALLY Gone,"My (24) horrific roommate (25) finally left today. We helped them move into our basement (we are renting to own so not technically our house but it’s “our” house) in the spring to help them escape their abusive family member. We were best friends. I would get calls daily of them bawling and telling me how awful it was there. Their mom is a hoarder so their house was always a wreck (no judgment but it was really bad. Like rotting food, a lot of animals, cat pee everywhere, the house was falling apart.) finally one day I get a call that they are getting kicked out and need a place to stay. I’d already discussed it with my now husband and since our previous roommate was wanting to move in with his gf the timing worked out ok. Our last roommate offered to pay the first months rent for them even though he wouldn’t be living there- just as a favour to our friend. It’s super cheap rent for our area and the size. We did ALL of her move in- furniture, animals, everything in a few days. I bought her furniture and things for her cats to make it more comfortable for her, I covered groceries for honestly most of the time she’s been here, and all household items (detergent, cleaning supplies, etc) 

She was really anxious about the move and kept talking about what bad experiences she’s had living with other people (red flag in retrospect…) and reiterated over and over that communication was the most important thing to her, that she was scared we would let things build up and resent her. She suffers from some mental health issues so we were very reassuring that we could set up ground rules and that we both are pretty honest (and kind) communicators. She had a lot going on in her life at the time ( a court thing, relationship issues, etc) so we knew she would be needing some time to decompress. We offered to pay the seconds months rent so she could get back on her feet. She refused- then the third month let me know a day before that she couldn’t pay so I did. She didn’t have a lot of financial literacy so my husband took her to do all her back taxes (spent hours and hours helping her and fronted the initial filing cost) to try and get her in an better position. The plan always was that she’d stay here for a year ish and get her shit together and then be able to move into her own place with a safety net of money and be in a more stable place mentally. 

Well. She spent the last 7 and 1/2 months doing nothing but taking advantage of us. She doesn’t drive- so my husband would drive her around for errands. She doesn’t have a working phone (she owed over 700$ on a phone bill so it was shut off) so she would call us on wifi and ask us to order her food…. And if we could pick it up (this was a near weekly thing.) She would tell me how much she wanted to get sober and then ask us to take her to the liquor store multiple times a week- if we didn’t take her she would get her abusive on and off again boyfriend to. She wanted to quit smoking- she would even ask if I could hold on to packs for her to resist temptation- and then ask us to pick up cigarettes. It was constant drama. We felt like we had suddenly had a teenage daughter. Anytime any issues around the home were brought up (we ignored a lot but she very frequently left huge messes or left food out to go bad, or just generally wasn’t very clean) she would have a full blown meltdown where it basically amounted to “fine I won’t use anything in the house ever again. Sorry you hate me.” We would ignore to not escalate it and get a crying phone call hours later apologizing and telling us how embarrassed she was. We were always gracious and accepted and just asked if we could communicate differently. It was honestly a lot. I felt drained every single day. I just kept thinking things would calm down. 

My (now) husband and I were planning our wedding for the end of summer during all of this and she was my MOH. She talked a lot about doing a bachelorette party, different activities, wanting to be involved- she didn’t follow through on anything. She was supposed to do my makeup- she did one trial and then dropped it completely. Two days before my wedding she backed out of staying at the hotel with me and getting our nails done together- I basically said I was done and that she wasn’t being a good friend. Cue another guilt ridden text and call- I expressed how sad I was that she wasn’t involved in anything. She felt so bad that she ended up doing everything and said she was being selfish and she would understand if I uninvited her. I didn’t. It was two days before the wedding…. 

After the wedding (which went fine from her end- nothing crazy but she showed up and gave a nice speech) we wanted some privacy and asked for a bit of space. She lasted two days before asking us for favours. I have a hard death anniversary the same month as our wedding and expressed to her that I needed a lot of space and needed her to leave me alone around that time. She continually asked my husband for favours and texted me about household chores day of. 

Start of fall I finally lost it. I’d sent a very basic “hey don’t touch this I need it for uni” text about it something in our yard in our roommate chat- she replied privately saying that I was texting very rudely and she didn’t understand why I was being so mean to her. I admit I blew up- I sent back that I had kept it together through the wedding and have been kind but she needed to back off. She blocked me on all social media and just said ok. I asked her to not use our dishes, detergent, etc as it was getting too expensive and we weren’t on friendly terms. 

I had a health crisis and when I was better I sent her a message saying that I wanted to have a phone call to clear the air and explain what happened and to apologize for losing my temper. She was really excited and grateful. We had a huge call where I finally felt like we had cleared the air- I was really open about how difficult this was on us, communication was impossible, she was struggling with addiction and we felt we were enabling her- etc. blah blah blah. She was very apologetic and acknowledged she put us in a really bad spot and really ruined our friendship. We ended the call on good terms and with hopes that in time we could be friends again.  

Well. Again. That didn’t really happen. My husband and I are buying our home in the new year- we let her know 6 MONTHS in advance that she’d have to leave when we finalized the sale as we didn’t feel comfortable being “landlords” and we had some renos to do. She was grateful for the heads up- told us not to worry about it. Last month- a couple days before rent was due she tells us she’s moving out- doesn’t want to move in the winter. We say okay no problem- you need to pay half of your rent for next month because this is short notice. She acts like this is a big favour to us. That she won’t need two weeks to get out. 

We knew she was bullshitting. She wasn’t completely out until 4pm today. And the place is an absolute wreck. We have to replace all the carpet. There is massive staining everywhere. Her cats knocked over a coffee pot and she had obviously left it there for weeks. She rented a carpet cleaner and it’s still disgusting. She asked for my husbands help moving yesterday because her friends truck broke and couldn’t help her. She asked this 3 hours before he had to leave for work. He helped her because he didn’t think she’d get out on time otherwise. He is way too nice and is still speaking kindly to her at this point- I’ve given up and haven’t been saying much of anything. Whatever is what it is. 

The real kicker is- she had her mom come to stand and intimidate my husband while he did the final walk through. She wouldn’t speak to him just stared in the doorway. My roommate tells my husband she has to run some garbage out- the mom goes with her- and they just take off before he’s even finished checking everything. She’s now moved back in with her mom and everything is exactly the same as it was 7 1/2 months ago except my house is ruined, I’ve lost a friendship, and I’ve wasted countless hours (and dollars) trying to help someone that obviously can’t be helped. I would be less angry if she’d at least moved out on her own, or figured out her addiction issues, or literally made any improvement. Even if she walked away and we weren’t friends anymore- at least it wouldn’t feel like a complete waste.

I **lost an important keyring** ***(containing both my car keys, a house key, a mailbox key, a small fob — along with a precious little charm my recently deceased uncle gave me)*** in the tumble between that *US Gas* & the *South Coast Mitsubishi*, on the Eastern intersection. I will offer a cash reward of $50 for the safe & prompt return of my keys! 

Feeling altogether intact (but more than a healthy bit embarrassed), I hopped up quickly without looking behind or checking my pockets. So while I managed to keep my iced coffee upright in the fall, I failed to prioritize properly in the moment and certainly lost the keys there.

I live only a block up and had the keys just prior. But when I crashed, I landed on my hip & sadly they were in a loose grey hoodie pocket on the side that gravity didn’t favor. 

**This occurred at 5:30pm on 15 Nov. 2024** toward the Southeastern edge of Harbor.

I figure since it happened less than a mile from the police station, perhaps a *Good Samaritan* may have witnessed or will have since located them. I hope that person then then decides to turn them in to the police station or sees this post. I skated back and forth looking for them to no avail within 15 minutes of the fall, and even asked the gas station guys if anyone turned anything in. I had no luck. So I skated 0.75 mi down Fair Dr. to CMPD and filed a lost property report. 

If you if you saw this or know of anyone who recovered my keys, please reach out to me or take them to the police station down the road. I’d be happy to pay you a reward for the good deed. I’m sure they will turn up. I’ll also post other places. I am making signs to post at that intersection. I am open to ideas.

S01E01- We've Gotta Get Out Of This Place – The Animals 
(was released in 1965)

(This song is playing on the radio in the cafeteria. Boyd is ringing the bell in the street)

The song is about:

A call to freedom and escape
From a place of suffering and oppression
A longing to leave misery behind
And find a better future

The lyrics describe the feeling of being trapped in a hopeless place, where life is hard and without a future. The song became an anthem for the youth of the time.

S01E03 - If It Be Your Will – The Webb Sisters (released 1984)

""If It Be Your Will"" is a song written by Leonard Cohen and popularized by various artists, including The Webb Sisters.

The song is about:

A longing for surrender and submission
To divine will or destiny
A recognition of human limitation
And a search for guidance and direction

The lyrics explore themes of faith, hope and resignation. The song's title is inspired by the Christian prayer ""If it be your will"" (Luke 22:42), which expresses the willingness to accept the divine plan.

The song can also be interpreted as:

A call to humility and acceptance
A recognition of impermanence
A longing for connection with something greater.

A young man who must go to war

- Blue – Joni Mitchell (released 1971)

A longing for connection and understanding
An exploration of loneliness and introspection

S01E05 - If I Had A Boat – Lyle Lovett (Released 1987)

(Boyd gets the signal he's been asking for when this song starts playing on the radio)

A dream of freedom and adventure
A fantasy of escaping routine
A desire to explore the world
And find a sense of purpose

The lyrics describe the imagination of a man who dreams of owning a boat and sailing around the world, leaving behind the worries and responsibilities of everyday life.

S01E10 - Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere – Neil Young (released 1969)

(The song plays on the cafeteria radio when a bus stops)

The song is about:

A feeling of disappointment and disorientation
A critique of modern society
A longing for authenticity and connection
A reflection on the search for meaning

The lyrics describe the feeling of emptiness and disillusionment that can arise in a world that seems to have lost its meaning and purpose.

SEASON 2

S02E1 - A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall – Bob Dylan (released 1963)

(-Opening song. In the cafeteria, the radio starts playing this song by itself.

The song is about:

An apocalyptic vision of the future
A warning about nuclear destruction
A critique of social and political injustice
A call to action and awareness

The lyrics describe a series of images and scenes that paint a picture of a world in crisis, with references to the Cold War, the nuclear threat and the fight for social justice.

S02E02 - Who By Fire – Buck 65 

(original song ""Who By Fire"" is by Leonard Cohen, released in 1974 on his album ""New Skin for the Old Ceremony"")

(In the cafeteria, the radio turns on by itself and this song starts playing. Julie wakes up and runs out in search of her father)

Mortality and the inevitability of death
Reflection on life and its meaning
The search for answers about human destiny

# 'Twas the night before Black Friday, when all through the store,

# Not a shopper was stirring; they'd soon storm the floor.

# The pallets were stacked in the warehouse with care,

# In hopes that the crowds soon would tear through their share.

#  The workers were nestled all snug in their vests,

# With visions of coffee breaks easing their stress.

# And I in my gloves, with my box cutter tight,

# Had just braced myself for a long, frantic night.

#  

# When out on the dock there arose such a clatter,

# I sprang from the aisle to see what was the matter.

# Away to the bay door I flew in a dash,

# Tripped over a Roomba, and nearly did crash.

#  

# The glow of fluorescents on tech new and sleek

# Gave the lustre of promise to the deal-seekers' peak.

# When what to my weary eyes should appear,

# But a semi of TVs and appliances near.

#  

# With a grizzled old driver, so lively and spry,

# I knew in a moment he'd been through this ride.

# More rapid than FedEx his helpers they came,

# And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:

#  

# ""Now, Sony! Now, Samsung! Now, Dell and LG!

# On, Apple! On, Fitbit! On, Canon and HP!

# To the top of the shelves! To the end of the rows!

# Now stack away, stack away! Go, go, go, go!""

#  

# As cords tangled wildly while unboxing sets,

# I knew we’d be buried in tech and regret.

# So up to the rafters the items they flew,

# With carts full of gadgets, and smartwatches too.

#  

# And then, in a twinkling, I heard from the door,

# The rumble and stampede of crowds wanting more.

# As I gripped my walkie, and spun all around,

# Through the front burst a frenzy with cries that did sound.

#  

# Their eyes—how they glistened! Their elbows, how wary!

# Their carts overflowing, their faces so scary!

# Their hands clutched the flyers, marked deals circled bold,

# While I whispered to myself, ""These never get old.""

#  

# The bundles of cables they flung in their sacks,

# With printers and laptops and smart speaker stacks.

# As I stacked more TVs, and dodged every plea,

# I muttered, ""It's not on sale; check aisle three!""

#  

# The clock ticked on slowly, my feet turned to lead,

# Yet visions of paychecks kept hope in my head.

# And laying a hand on the shrink-wrapped display,

# I sighed, knowing this chaos would soon fade away.

#  

# The manager called out, ""Stock faster! Let’s go!

# The shoppers are ravenous; we need this to flow!""

# But I heard him exclaim as he ducked for his life,

# ""Happy Black Friday to all—and to all, shop with strife!""

we exist in small ways.



my mother exists

through her warm laughs echoing in the house

and the way she leaves a *bindi* on the mirror before sleeping.

my father exists 

through his English newspapers with difficult headlines

and his stark, bitter coffee without any hint of sugar.



most days,

I exist somewhere in between

a mindless lecture on buying fruits,

and the fondness of my new radio.

but some days,

I want to exist

as tiny raindrops on wild Taro leaves

or as the dust collected on old, abandoned books,

perhaps as the morning sunlight nesting on your shoulder

or linger as some kind habit of yours, like,

petting every stray animal that you come across.

I've been away from dating for a very long time and I'm looking for a relationship with a lifelong partner. Some details about me:

* My favourite sports are skiing, bicycling, and kayaking. I am not intensely active in these sports, only as recreation rather than for competition. I have helped friends get into these sports as well.
* My preferred vacations are ski trips, road trips, and car camping. I typically manage one winter and one summer vacation.
* My favourite foods are East Asian, North American, and Mediterranean. I am a tea person rather than a coffee person.
* My pastimes are listening to and reading about sci-tech and world news, and being on Reddit (unfortunately). I used to game and watch anime, though I spend less time on these in recent years. I am open to expanding my hobbies to include my partner's.
* I prefer music that is more melodic, but the spectrum runs from trance to power metal.
* My university major was in psychology, with most electives in literature, philosophy, and physics.
* My primary language is English. I can speak Cantonese conversationally and Mandarin at a basic level as well.
* I have stable and steady work, median income, and a small condo.
* I cook from recipes, but loathe grocery shopping. 
* I am a repair rather than replace kind of person, with DIY interests.
* Aside from sports, vacation, and work, I am very much a homebody. If you believe in MBTI, I am either an INTP or INTJ and prefer small-group social engagements at most.
* I am 164cm tall. 
* My favourite kind of humour is witty and cuts at the core of social issues with a dash of the absurd, though my own humour is admittedly a bit dry in comparison. I don't like humour that is a veiled insult against an individual. 
* I am very family oriented and prioritize the home over all else. 
* I'm open to having children, but final decision depends on the social and economic situation of the time.
* I do not smoke, drink, or use any other substances. 
* I am not religious.
* I don't keep pets right now since I don't want to leave them at home while at work. I am ambivalent towards outdoor pets because I am a strictly shoes-off in the house person.

The woman I'm looking for:

* Generally finds the above details agreeable.
* Is in her upper 20s to around my age, without prior children. 
* Has a strong moral compass and ideas on how she would like to live. Doesn't have to be entirely compatible with me; I would prefer to meet someone and mutually decide on compromises, or find that we are not compatible, over being with someone who defers most decisions to me. 
* Is a bit sporty and fit, or willing to be active to a recreational level at least. I would like to share in the sports I enjoy.
* Is in the Metro Vancouver area or up to half a day's drive away. I am not interested in online or long distance relationships. Moving to her region is possible, but it would take serious consideration. 

If you are interested, please message me with your thoughts and information about the points I'm looking for. Feel free to ask me anything else you'd like to know.",1,1731733376.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

**[New Update]: WIBTAH if I drop out of a friend’s wedding after not being invited to the bachelorette**

**NEW UPDATE MARKED WITH** ----

-------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/4hy9c0i9q3): **October 2, 2024**

Hi! So I 25F am currently being pushed back and forth with my choice and I thought the lovely people of Reddit might be able to rein me in

i am currently 13 weeks pregnant and my friends around me have all been very happy and excited for me, however my childhood friend 25F, let’s call her Lisa. Stonewalled me since I announced at 8 weeks, I had assumed it was wedding stress but now I’m seconding guessing this.

In the weekend I was scrolling instagram and I came across a post where she had thanked everyone for coming to her bachelorette, photos of it’s the girls and her smiling in the middle and I sorta sat there shocked. At first I tried to be mature and just let it go… but this was a girl I grew up with, she was a bridesmaid in my wedding party and I’m a honorary bridesmaid for hers ( she’s not having a wedding party )

In the end I guess hormones took over and I ended up reaching out to her, at first I went “ oh looks like fun! “ and she replied that it was and after a tub of ice cream and a good sob I reached out and went “ hey, uh sorry to be this person but why wasn’t I invited? “

She immediately messaged me back with the response:

“Tbh the whole day was centred around drinking (wineries and heading to town after) and im not sure you would have enjoyed being around all of us drunk af especially cause your pregnant right now. I get that an invite would have been nice regardless, but in all honestly I just wanted to keep it very small. I’m really sorry you feel that way, but I don’t want to make this a big thing bc I’ve already had a shit week “

I tried to respond with hey thanks for getting back to me but I’m still upset cause the day is about you and I wanted to be there to celebrate you and then she rung me and just asked me to not make this a big thing once again and she sounded incredibly annoyed and like the door mat I am I dropped it

after thinking this over for the past few days I’m feeling very hurt and heartbroken, this was a girl I grew up with and loved and supported through a lot of shit, I’ve helped her plan and prepare a lot of her wedding so to suddenly get iced out like this I’m feeling a certain way.

my husband suggests we don’t go and I’m on the edge, so Reddit WIBTAH if I declined going to her wedding and distancing myself?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA with a few YTAs and ESHs**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I suppose whether you go or not depends on whether you enjoy weddings and whether you think you will enjoy being in the company of all those friends who went on the bachelorette party and never uttered a word about it to you.

> **OOP:** The issue is I’m considered one of her old friends, we grew up in a small town and moved to same city, we both took different paths in life. Both in jobs and social circles but I had always been invited to birthdays and events.. and while I might not be friends with her be group of friends they definitely know of me
> 
> But you make a good point, and something to consider

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Her saying “don’t make this a big thing” would piss me off. If you guys are close then she 100% should have at least invited you. The whole it’s my wedding and I can invite and do what I want is true, however that doesn’t mean you have no consequences for your decisions.

To me she doesn’t consider you as good of a friend as you may think.

**Commenter 3:** “I’m a honorary bridesmaid for hers ( she’s not having a wedding party )”

What the heck is this. is it a new fad I haven’t heard of or a way to get more partying and gifts from your friends without having them in the wedding ?

in any case WNBTA for ghosting her wedding. She deliberately did something that she knew would hurt your feelings and told you not to make a big thing out of it

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bD29mHCCMG) **October 2, 2024 (same day, 17 hours later)**

Hi! Hope this is allowed but you were all so wonderful and helpful and turns out I got an update sooner then I expected

so I haven’t heard from Lisa, that I expected

what I didn’t expect is a friend of Lisa to get in touch with me, let’s call her Sarah, I knew of Sarah and spoke to her a few times at events we attended together and she was one of the girls with myself went wedding dress shopping for Lisa, she was also a friend I noticed wasn’t at the bachelorette which was a surprise
anyway and at first she was doing a “ hey how are you “ and we did polite small talk blah blah until she finally went
“ so are you as pissed off and mad as I am at Lisa OP? “

Immediately I was slightly shocked as the few times I had met Sarah she was very I guess demure?

That opened the floodgates of information and she told me everything she knows, so what I didn’t put in the post is I actually waited 2 days before messaging Lisa about the lack of invite… turns out 3 of Lisa’s friends who also weren’t invited hit her up immediately after she posted on instagram asking why they weren’t invited

turns out these girls absolutely chewed Lisa alive and my “ confrontational “ was soft and finally it was revealed what actually happened and now I’m even more confused

so Lisa admitted to Sarah that her sister in law planned the bachelorette and just decided she was only going to invite the friends she knew.. so Lisa’s usual group of 8- 10 friends including me got narrowed down into 4 and Lisa decided not to correct her sister in law and just went with it, not realizing how many people she would be upsetting with not inviting people

apparently once people started attacking her she basically Lisa buried her head in sand and started making up lies to everyone on why they weren’t invited and using the same excuse of “ don’t make this a big deal “ until everyone realized the reasons were bullshit and called her out for it and the real truth came out

Sarah has informed me the girls who weren’t invited have all pulled out of the wedding, their partners included because they got the same annoyed response from Lisa before she told the truth and they all thought they didn’t deserve that… then she finally asked me what Lisa told me and I went deathly quiet on the phone before finally admitting she used my pregnancy as a excuse which then started poor Sarah on another rant of anger on how Lisa could say that to me! When I’m pregnant.. anyway we ended the call and she hoped we could get coffee sometime so I think I’ve made a friend?

so.. that’s the update.. this pregnant lady is very confused.. and I’m currently the number one buyer of ice cream at my local dairy LOL

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA she made it very clear that you and the group are not her friendship priority anymore. Perhaps her new SIL and her gang will be there to replace you guys. At least that is what she is making it seems.

Are her in laws paying for the majority of the wedding? Is she one of those pleasers that play along with the most annoying person so she can feel part of the group? You know she is in deep trouble, right? Her SIL must be some sort of single b each that likes to impose over others desire.

But the way, congrats on the baby. 13 weeks so so?

> **OOP:** Exactly 13 weeks and 5 days!
> 
> And frankly I don’t know what to make of the in-laws, I know for a fact she’s ( Lisa ) paying for most of the wedding.. I will be honest I don’t particularly like her fiancé all though I’ve never outright told her just relayed my concerns
> 
> one of the reasons they actually have no bridal party was because the groom demanded 5, he had 5 guy friends he was close to and while Lisa has multiple friends they all work in fields where not everyone has time to take out for events.. therefor a lot of them turned her down.. I think I was one of 3 who said yes
> 
> In the end I know it turned into a massive argument between the two and the groom finally stomped his feet and said no wedding party then! and so Lisa went around giving out the honorary title and asked certain people to wear a certain colour… it’s all rather sad actually
> 
> and then the groom asked her to make his SIL MOH cause she means a lot to him… a lot of 🚩🚩🚩 But she’s also the kinda person where it for a second you negatively comment on her relationship she cuts you off so I’ve always just been supportive in the background

**Lisa should not had lied to OOP and other friends for not inviting them to the bachelorette party**

> **OOP:** I think that’s why I’m now confused and I’ve gone from “ yeah I’m not going! “ to “ awh shit… “
> 
> Because I can see both sides, Lisa was an idiot for not reaching out to everyone before posting on instagram about the situation.. and is probably stressed out of her mind right now
> 
> It’s kinda why I’m glad once I got the annoyed phone call from her I just dropped it and went inwards where it sounds like the other girls went “ nah fuck that “
> 
> So I’m very much on the fence right now and im sorta waiting to see if I hear from Lisa.. if I’ll ever get the truth like what Sarah did or if she’s willing to let me believe I didn’t get invited cause the lemon sized fetus in my womb is a buzz killer

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/LGkB1pjbLS): **October 8, 2024 (six days later)**

Guys.. I want off this train 🤣

So minor and small update

so as mentioned in my previous post Lisa and I are childhood friends, and our mothers are friends.

I finally shared what had happened with my mum and first mum was so upset for me but also gave me an “ I told you so OP you are too much of a doormat ( thanks mum ) but she then said I have a big heart and sometimes people tend to use and abuse it ( ONCE AGAIN THANKS MUM ). “

anyway.. mum then gave more tea, more gossip
So apparently while Lisa has been telling people that she’s paying for her wedding out of her own pocket, turns out a big fat lie! Lisa’s mother had been sending her money and from what my mother told me it was a decent chunk of change, how do we know this? Well Lisa’s mum went to my mum upset because one thing I forgot to notice is Lisa’s mum wasn’t wasn’t invited to the bachelorette party

( context for people outside nz, we don’t have bridal parties so usually what people do is the older generation gets invited to like dinner and then the younger girls go out and party if you have a piss up, if you don’t have a piss up and just do a more chilled bachelorette then mum will be there the whole time, like mine )

So Lisa mother was distraught because she had been sending Lisa a decent amount of cash, had been told she wasn’t allowed to give her opinion about anything to do with the wedding and then wasn’t invited to her bachelorette.. and Lisa’s mother is honestly a nice lady so to hear that it kinda broke my heart and if I had known Lisa’s mother was sending money I would have told Lisa to pull her head in

my mum then had to break the news about why I wasn’t invite to the bachelorette and Lisa’s poor mother was mortified

So that’s the update.. is it even an update? I don’t know… I’m just very sad at this point cause I don’t know where my friend has gone? If she’s there anymore? Is this a bridezilla moment? I don’t know..

My ice cream journey though, I read everyone people have been loving this pregnancy ladies carving so allow me to indulge, recently I tried the Ben and Jerries banoffee flavor and it was very good, I wish the caramel swirl was mixed throughout all the ice cream but beggars can’t be choosers, and I had the most amazing strawberry sorbet the other day! Honestly so good I almost asked the ice cream shop for a tub of it but I had self control!

**Additional Information from OOP**

> **OOP:** I would like to acknowledge quickly in the comments that just because my friends mum was sending her money doesn’t make her mum entitled to change things about the wedding, but looking back on conversations I have had with Lisa I know for a fact her poor mum got absolutely stone walled when it came to offering suggestions..

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You know, I'm not sure I believe this story about how Lisa's SIL set the guest list. I think that might be a lie Lisa was telling to Sarah to try to excuse her actions. If that's the case, Lisa totally threw her SIL under the bus. Which... does SIL know that she's being partly blamed for this?

Kinda wonder if Lisa's mother would appreciate knowing that maybe she wasn't included because Lisa's SIL made all the decisions.

> **OOP:** I’m starting to realize that is most definitely the case, SIL has been thrown under the bus cause Lisa is realizing that people don’t take to kindly to being disrespected
> 
> as for Lisa’s mum knowing about Lisa’s excuse I don’t know.. I’ll talk to my mum and see what she thinks. For now I don’t want to overload the poor woman cause it’s a lot

**OOP explains what a piss up is**

> **OOP:** It’s kiwi slang for like a party where you would drink a lot of booze

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Rj275vSTwI): **November 9, 2024 (one month later)**

Just wanna give a big thanks to everyone on Reddit for coming along on this wild journey with me, you have all helped me not go insane this past month.

onto the update- so I attended the wedding i know I know you can all boo me in the comments but I was leaning towards not going until I spoke to my mum who ultimately told me this would be a nice way of closing our chapter of friendship, I could walk away with my head held high.. later she told me that also Lisa’s mum begged my mum to convince to me attend.

I attended with my husband and I immediately noticed the vibe and aura was completely off.

People of Reddit who are married who will understand me, weddings feel like love, this didn’t.. this was technically a instagram picture perfect wedding but it could have been anyone’s wedding.. it didn’t feel personal.

My friend barely smiled unless it was photos, her vows were robotic, and the MOH was useless, that was my biggest pet peeve, it is not that hard to see the brides dress needs fluffing or she needs a drink and even I’ll admit I felt no joy watching speeches and how everyone, spoke about the groom and threw something in for the bride at the last second.

The bride acted like we were good, like there was no beef, like the bachelorette thing never happened. I felt strange, I didn’t like it because I know her and she isn’t able to hide her emotions and she wears her emotions on her sleeves so I think she genuinely thinks nothing is wrong between us. She pulled me aside and said how she loved and appreciated me and how she was excited to be an honorary aunty and kept touching my belly and blowing kisses at it. I left the wedding feel a lot of emotions, I know I’m hormonal right now and I feel everything but I just. I don’t know?

But I can sit here and admit the friendship is done, I don’t think I can look at her the same after everything I learnt talking to my mother and with how I was treated. The chapter is closed and other then the bridemaids thing I can look back somewhat fondly on our childhood and time together… planning our marriages out with our bratz dolls. I’ve never been good with friendship break ups but this time I think I am, I think I’ll be okay.

Thank you all for listening to the rambles of this pregnant lady, who has also all enjoyed your ice cream recommendations. You have all expanded my horizons.. and I’m sure the little one in my stomach appreciates it too

Signing off

Love OP ❤️

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** What was the reason why she didn't have her friends at the bachelorette? Was she really that much of a pushover that she didn't push back when her friends weren't invited? Or did she really not give a shit?

> **OOP:** In all honestly I do not know, I think this is the part that will forever swirl around in my mind.
> 
> Was I not invited cause SIL took over or did she truly not want me there? I don’t know and I think I’m at a stage of while I think about it I don’t actually wanna know
> 
> Finding out the truth runs the risk of these semi happy memories I have being tainted, and I think at least while I’m also growing a small human, I don’t want to know
> 
> maybe one day I’ll put my big girl panties on and ask but for now I’m content with just wondering

**Commenter 2:** She will want you back When her marriage is off , stay away . And enjoy motherhood

**Commenter 3:** She's totally going to be all over you when your baby is born. Honorary Aunty, my ass.

1gsfy9y,https://i.redd.it/vyd85mp0471e1.jpeg,Review #3: 13th Colony Double Oaked B3 ,"Intro: 
One of my absolute favorite whiskeys is back for its 3rd release. 13th Colony has gained a cult like, fanatical following largely attributable to this annual expression limited to ~3,500 bottles. She’s unruly, powerful, and in my humble opinion can stand in the ring with anything that is being released by distilleries today. Hailing from Georgia and darker than anything else in my liquor cabinet comes this limited release. Admittedly I might be coming in with a little bit of bias for how much I love this whiskey but I haven’t given it the proper hour of contemplation that it deserves so let’s dive in. 
Stats: 
   Proof: 133.74 (66.87%) 
   Age Statement: NAS 
   Year: 2024 

Nose: 
If the La Brea tar pits were made of whiskey this is what I imagine it’d smell like. Every scent within the glass is almost sticky sweet on the nose. It’s a chemically sweet backdrop that’s powerful and similar to paint thinner but very pleasant. The sweet oak morphs into maple and praline candy with a hint of savory that’s similar to burnt bacon. Dark stone fruits are more present in this batch 3 than they were in batch two which leaned more into oak. They’re sweeter than a dried fig, almost artificial in a jolly rancher way (but dark unlike ranchers). More cherry/plum than apricot or fig but far darker than a buffalo trace cherry. Some of the acidity in this is reminiscent of grapefruit. Light hints of Madeira/wine come through. All of it is blended with a pound of burnt brown sugar and butter. Insignificant amounts of spice to me. 

Nose score: 9.4/10 

Palate:
This pour is quite viscous and coats your entire mouth and throat with ease. The chemical sweetness remains on the nose while it enters the palate, but is lessened on the tastebuds. Sweet oak howls and elicits a strong tingling sensation, less than in batch two. The same fruits in the nose are far more present on the palate than batch two which is an interesting change. No wine on palate, and brown sugar remains in play.

Palate score: 9.0/10

Finish: you better enjoy tar like brown sugar as you’re not getting rid of this finish anytime soon. Chocolate and coffee announce themselves in with a muted oak note. This whiskey hasn’t tasted young at any point of the process until the finish where it seems to be in the 5 1/2 - 6 1/2 year range. The finish feels similar to that of a whiskey finished in Madeira or Sherry in that it’s sticky and while double oaked, it’s almost toasted. Light hazelnut. 

Finish score: 9.2/10


Overall: 9.2/10. It’s limited by its palate that tries a bit too hard at times. If you aren’t a proof hound this is not for you. The nose is something that I would gladly choose to have as a candle scent in my house and is the most impressive part of this whiskey. I’ll admit that I chose this whiskey for the Tyson/Paul fight night because it’s the whiskey equivalent of getting into the cage with Tyson. Might get your ear bitten off but that paycheck is probably worth it. 

Conclusion:
When you think of bourbon you may think of Kentucky, but if you haven’t given this Georgia distillery a try it’s a must. Secondary is steep on these but falling slightly, and they can be had for a few hundred less than a GTS. I personally would choose this over a 2023 GTS every single day of the week without hesitation, but that might just be me. It respectfully isn’t just a hyped bottle but may be too brash and aggressive for some folks preferences. Like a brash younger sibling with a point to prove. ",8,1731733243.0,bourbon,0,1.0,False

[Original Post (unddit)](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/relationships/comments/4x9fu0/deleted_by_user/): **August 11, 2016**

My boyfriend and I started dating in July of 2014. He is the biggest optimist in the world and lived a pretty cushy life as the only child of divorced parents. We both lived separately and had jobs that covered all our bills and then some; he bought an expensive sports car, gaming computer, and purebred dog (important later). He was in school, while I had graduated a year before and started work at my first big kid job. Life was great, and the first six months were some of the happiest times of my life.

The first week of January 2015, he was wrongfully terminated from his job - a new supervisor was on the warpath to replace everyone on BF's shift with his friends and waited until the new year, after the holiday rush was over, to start cleaning house. Government sided with BF during the unemployment claim, and BF started receiving benefits. He decided to focus on finishing school instead of looking for more work.

This where the cracks started. He was supposed to graduate that May, but he failed a class and couldn't, so he had to go to school in the summer. In June, his savings ran out and he could either afford his car payment and insurance or rent. His lease was up at the end of July, so I agreed to pay his rent and he could move in with me in July and finish school.

He found out weeks before he was supposed to graduate that he needed one particular elective to get out. He had to go to school that fall, too. I demanded he get a job to help with expenses, as I wasn't planning on having to support him for so long. A month or two, fine. Six months? No.

He got a job as an insurance agent for an extremely reputable company at the end of July. Turns out this job is commission-based... being the optimist he is, the manager's talk of being able to make unlimited amounts of money drew him in. I paid for him to take the certification tests he needed to work, and he started trying to build a client base selling structured financial products. He made and makes nothing. He'll have a $700 payday for a small close, then nothing for months. He's out there busting his ass every day, but building a financial client base from scratch without any family privilege or existing networks is ridiculously hard.

In Sept 2015, we downsized from my fancy downtown apartment to a POS house on the edge of the ghetto. I paid the security deposit and double rent at both places for a month as that's how the lease overlaps worked out, totalling about $3500. By November, my savings was almost gone and I had to liquidate shares of my family trust (on which I took a penalty, as my grandfather did not want us to access it before age 25) to get us by. By Dec, I had $300 in savings and nothing left in my family trust. I had spent about $17k since July supporting us, his job (he needed money to take clients out for lunch and coffee), his dog, and my dog.

Since September, we had been having recurring fights about money and chores. I expected him to pick up 90% of the housework as his way of paying me back. He never shaped up on either front. He just kept repeating to me the same things that his manager said to him to draw him in: ""It'll get better. Everyone struggles at first. If you hang on, you'll make it. Once I make it, we'll be rolling in it."" Every time we had a fight. Every. Time.

Two weeks before Christmas, we had this fight again and I demanded he do something other than feed me bullshit inspirational quotes. I left the house in a rage and drove to buy cigarettes. I was thinking of who I should text and ask to crash for the night when I got angry. Fuck no, I'm not crashing on someone's couch while he lives on the house I pay for, sleeps in the bed I pay for, and eats the food I pay for. I returned home and gave him 10 days to pack his shit and get out. He moved into his Dad's house, and I spent Christmas morning chilling with my dog and returning his presents online.

We started hanging out again in January of this year, and things seemed to be going well for his business, enough for him to consider getting an apartment. I told him he could move back in and if we couldn't split expenses evenly at first, he had to get serious about doing chores and sticking to my budget. It was fine at first, but by April, he wasn't doing any chores and I was back to paying 100% of his and his dog's living expenses. He also was about to not meet quota for that quarter and asked to me to sign up for a policy and then reverse it after quarter-end so I'd be reimbursed. I lost my shit on him. I work in capital markets, I can't afford to commit financial fraud for him. I told him I've sacrificed enough for him, he can't come for my integrity too. (Bonus: the friend who he did rope into doing the reversed policy still hasn't been reimbursed, 5 months later.)

We had another blowout fight, and he majorly stepped up on the chores front, which has sustained to this day. Money was still touch and go - when he didn't get paid, his fancy car ate it up every month. He landed a big case in May, and paid his half rent in June for the first time, and offered to pay all of July, which he did. By the second week of July, he was completely broke again, and told me last minute he couldn't pay August rent. I had to scramble to get the cash needed in one account to send the check. He couldn't afford to pay for his half of groceries like he promised either, so that was a scramble too.

I'm so sick of this. I work an incredible job for my age, paid off all my college debt 8 months after graduation, and own my car, yet I'm living paycheck to paycheck supporting him. There's always something, even if it's a legitimate something, that keeps him from paying his half. It's been a fucking year and there hasn't even been marginal improvement. His job is meant for filthy rich trust fund kids who can afford to be this broke while they build their client base. I admire his optimism but he's not suffering for listening to it... I am.

I have enabled him far too long and after the most recent fight about money, I realized he is too immature to be trying his hand at this job. He complains when he meets with clients that spend their money on cars and trips and toys instead of buying a policy from him, when he blew his money on a car and a gaming PC when he had a steady-paying job. He has no problem having regular, circular fights with me yet won't ask his parents for help because ""that would be awkward and I don't want to lose [his] father's respect"". He's hurt that I don't trust his promises when he's barely kept any of them, from his graduation date to his bills to chores. He is too immature to see the larger picture, and because I've been enabling him to a fault, he has never needed to because the consequences don't fall on him. They fall on me.

Last night, I told him I'm not renewing the lease and am moving out by myself. He followed me around the house pleading with me and asking me questions... ""How do you feel about me? What about us? Where will I go? What will it take for you to let me come with you?"" Questions I have answered every. single. fight. Questions HE needs to answer because it's his fucking life. I refused to answer them again and went to bed. He stood in the doorway and said that stupid Marilyn Monroe quote about not deserving people at their best if you can't handle them at your worst. I said he was totally allowed to feel that way and walk. He shut himself in the computer room and slept on the couch that night.

I can't believe he feels like I'm abandoning him after all I've done. He doesn't understand how hurtful it is when he tries to pay his half of rent and bills by spouting off platitudes about struggle and success. It makes me feel so fucking disrespected and I have told him this every fight. And despite having this fight regularly, it's like he's not even listening to me. Why would he? I haven't made myself worthy of respect by being his financial doormat and not sticking to my boundaries. At this point, I feel he is using me as a safety net. He knows I won't let him or his dog starve so he doesn't make himself care about coming up with the money for food.

He is deluded by his optimism so much so that he breaks every optimistic promise he makes to me. He talks about how he thinks a client will buy an expensive plan, but then they get the cheap one and now he can't pay rent. He talks about how he met loads of people at a networking event, but only 3 call him back and he needs money to take them out. He says he's set to get 40% enrollment on a corporate contract, but only gets 11% so he can't pay for groceries this week. I used to think he was lying to me, but now I see he's lying to himself. He hasn't matured at all and grounded his expectations in reality because I've been standing in the way of it. Because of this, I don't trust him to give me a realistic end date to supporting him, because he'll probably be wrong about that too.

And now that I'm done being his Atlas and holding his world together, he's starting to panic. It bothers me SO FUCKING MUCH that he didn't take me seriously until I let the hammer drop on him, as it should have been in the beginning. The irony is not lost on me that he's a broke financial advisor.

I miss the first six months of this relationship, when he had a job that paid well enough to cover up his financial immaturity. I could have taught him a few things that might have stuck instead of picking up ALL the slack and mommying the everliving fuck out of him. I miss going to sit-down dinners and football games and movies with him. I miss the feeing I had a month after I met him, where I knew I would marry him. Now I'm not sure at all... I'm sad I love him. It's a burdensome tether instead of the inner flame it used to be.

And maybe this is my own fatal optimism speaking, but that guy is still there, buried underneath all this bullshit. He just has to grow the fuck out of it and take his own risks to learn his own lessons. I can't even explain how badly I want the guy I met back. I'm tearing up writing this. I agreed to him moving back in this year because (according to him) he only needed a few more months to make it and be stable, and I wanted that for him so badly so we could go back to enjoying life together. My hope is hamstringing me, just like it's doing to him.

Can our relationship survive now that I'm seriously taking steps to insure it doesn't bankrupt me? Or am I being stupid in thinking anything will change? Will he move in with his dad and just get him to be the new enabler? What am I doing wrong that's preventing him from understanding how I feel?

tl;dr: BF's optimistic dreams about his job duped me into supporting 100% of his living expenses for over a year. I've had enough, and am moving out on my own so I can start saving again. He feels abandoned, I feel used. Is there a future for us at all?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** No, you couldn't have. People have to want to learn for lessons to stick.
I understand why you're having trouble walking away, because his strengths and weaknesses are so closely tied. But you'd be making the exact same mistake he is by staying: doubling down on a bad decision because you're convinced you can turn it around with just a little more time and investment. He can't, and you can't either. Stop feeding into the sunk cost fallacy and go.

> **OOP:** This is so true. I'm a realist from an abusive home so he was such a bright light of positivity when I met him. Now it's burning me.
> 
> You're so right about me making the same mistake. I know what I have to do. It's gonna suck doing it, but... I'm worth it, to myself at least.

**Commenter 2:** There's no hope. You can not change anyone but yourself. He's the only one who can change himself. Instead of changing, he's doubling down on a philosophy that has proven to be a failure.

Why isn't he getting another job? Even if he can't let himself kill this dream and quit, he can at least work a second job. One that would actually pay minimum wage.

> **OOP:** He still has office hours during the day and it infuriates me that they don't pay him for that. He can't get a second job for that reason as he's meeting clients before and after common working hours. He can't even be an Uber driver because his fancy car is on the restricted cars list, and fuck if he's going to take my car too.
> 
> I hate his stupid fucking car so much. It represents how financially immature he is, because he didn't even use his money wisely when he had it and continues to buttfuck him to this day.
> 
> Did I mention he hasn't paid taxes or registered it either because he doesn't have the money? Not sure who will be paying that inevitable ticket, but it sure as hell won't be me.

**Commenter 3:** While he's certainly to blame for being irresponsible, I think you also share the blame for spending over $17,000 on someone you had been dating for less than 2 years at that point, and then taking him in again and putting yourself in the same situation. You ask if your relationship is repairable but this isn't just about what HE can do to shape up - what are you going to do to avoid making a series of very stupid choices again in the future when he messes up again? You can't control the choices he makes, but you can control the choices you make, and you've made very poor ones.

Personally, I would never want to put myself in a relationship with someone who can't support himself and had sucked by bank account dry like that. I would feel like his mother, not his partner, and that's supremely unattractive. You're better off cutting your loses and learning from this.

> **OOP:** Totally agree with all of this. Can't even explain how disappointed I am for doing this to myself.
> 
> > I would feel like his mother, not his partner, and that's supremely unattractive.
> 
> This is what started a big fight about chores. He complained about a lack of sex and I blew my fucking lid. I pay for all his shit, cook and clean, grocery shop, run errands, do things for the dogs, and he wants more? ""Why would I want to fuck my child??"" was my response.

**Commenter 4:** I'm not sure I understand how you went from living in a nice apt to living in a ghetto and spending $17k in the course of six months all because this guy moved in with you. You were already paying for your living expenses too, right? So all this guy should have added to what you were paying by yourself is the food he ate?

I mean, the guy sucks, dump him and all that. But I feel like we're missing a part of the story.

> **OOP:** I paid for his rent, utilities, groceries, his dog's food, any fast food or restaurant we went to, his test certifications, the deposit on the new apartment, clothes, a business suit for his job, and any client expenses he had. He paid one and a half month's rent in a year, otherwise I didn't see a dime from him. Everything I paid for. That's the whole story.

**Commenter 5:** Do you know his parents well? Maybe you should have a candid talk to his dad and outline how deep a hole his son is in. You can't give any more of yourself to keep him afloat, but his own family should. (I mean, not pay for him, but be there when he stumbles - because he's going to).

Also perhaps see a lawyer. You were living together, you may have some grounds to try and get that money back. GL.

> **OOP:** Both his parents hate me. Both are intense Christians who think what's happening is recompense for not getting married before living together. I'm the atheist harpy who stole their little boy from Jesus.
> 
> They don't know the extent of what's going on, just that we are strapped for cash. But I guarantee if I told either of his parents that I spent $25k-$30k supporting him, they will shrug and tell me to learn from it.

[Update (unddit)](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/relationships/comments/53wijm/deleted_by_user/): **September 21, 2016 (one month later)** 

Well a lot has happened since I made my first post. I guess I'll address it sequentially, since that's how I'm operating right now, moment to moment.

After I made that post, I decided to truly cut him off. I changed the wifi password, froze the credit card I gave him, applied to close our joint accounts, and threw out any gifts I ever gave him. We were planning on attending a dork convention over Labor Day (in Atlanta, for those familiar with the con scene) that I had budgeted paying for both of us over a year ago. I told him he couldn't go unless he paid for his half of the hotel and tickets, $600. Not sure why I did this instead of shooting straight and admitting he was out of his gourd if he thought he could go... shouldn't have played any games but I'm kinda glad I did because he told me he'd have $1000 to me by the end of August. Over text too, in writing.

I was floored. Suddenly he can come up with money for a weekend of partying and a chance to reel me back in? I said I would apply that to August's bills, then he could start paying down the rest of the ~$25k he owed me for supporting him this past year before he could spend his money on luxuries like out of state vacations. This was over text, and he never responded, and slept on the couch again that night.

That was a Friday. Saturday morning, he left the house around 9am with his dog, leaving all of his crap in my house. I piled all of his and his dog's stuff under his desk and got rid of any pictures of him around the house. I blocked him everywhere but Facebook and text. I went to two rental house showings, loved one of them and the landlord, put a deposit down that day, went on multiple walks with my dog as well as a long trip to the dog park, and celebrated/vented/drank wine through Twizzlers with my next door neighbour and her boyfriend. Ex-BF never returned that night.

Sunday, I spent the day working on cosplays and outfits for the convention as well as goofing off with my neighbour and dog. It was lovely. I kept waiting for this wave of sadness and regret to hit me, but it never did. He had been out for 24 hours and his name wasn't on the lease - I texted him that his claim to residency was gone, and he needed to come get his things with 24 hours notice. He said he was coming that night. I said 24 hours notice. He agreed to Monday evening.

Monday, he picks up his stuff in his father's truck and gives me back the key. Hours after he left, he added a song to our shared YouTube playlist - ""Say Something"" by A Great Big World. I added ""Gravity"" by Sara Bareilles and ""Too Good"" by Drake, then removed his access to the playlist the next morning. Yay middle school communication methods.

Wednesday his best friend texts me like nothing is wrong. Thursday, I text my ex about when I can expect his check in the mail. He doesn't respond. Friday morning, I email him. At this point, as far as I can tell, he's gone no contact with me. I send him one last email a day later basically stating that, and he asks me to coffee Sunday night.

We met up for coffee. He never mentions repayment at all but in the discussion about our feelings, we both felt the same way about this: betrayed, abandoned, hurt, and distrustful of the other person. He felt I had lied when I said I was fine supporting him and basically insinuated that I wouldn't want to be repaid if I believed in us because otherwise I was actually loaning him money under the guise of love and setting him up to fail. When I realized he felt just as used as me because I cut him off from my money, I knew I was done. My stomach sank like a weight. I let him finish talking, then we parted ways. He asked if he could contact me, I said I needed a break.

The next day I emailed him about the $1000 he promised me and reminded him he never discussed repayment at our meeting. He didn't respond for days, then the day I was set to leave town for the convention, he replies saying the money was on the way. Cool, it can sit in my mailbox for 5 days while I'm out of state. Also, during this time he was telling mutual friends we were ""going through a rough patch"" yet my friends were finding him on Tinder and OKC.

I partied my tail off for the entire convention and when I came back, the check was in an un-postmarked envelope in my mailbox. I cashed it and sent him an email telling him such and asked that he use snail mail for future repayments instead of trespassing on my property when he knows I won't be home. I seriously wonder if he was looking for the spare key I left with the dog sitter... so creepy.

He replied to that email with some mushy ""I love you and I know I fucked up"" things claiming he is too nice and can't say no and his urge to help others makes him neglect himself and he needs to work on that. It was the most laughable apology on earth. ""I was so nice and helpful that I couldn't stop myself from draining you of all your money and energy! My bad.""

I replied ""You broke my heart and my bank account. It will be a long time before they're both fixed, and my then I hope I won't be stupid enough to trust you with them a third time. I will be responding to emails about repayment, otherwise good luck with everything.""

He replied, ""If I could take everything back that I did, I would. I love you (name). With all my heart. I could have prevented it all. I could have taken action. But I let you slip away. And that'll be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I'm truly truly sorry for hurting you. I just want you to be happy. That's all I've ever wanted.""

I moved out of the house we lived in to a similar one a few streets away. Moving helped keep me busy enough to not think about this. I threw out all our mementos and pictures and shit in the process so everything in the new place is all me. Just me. Now I'm settled in and it feels like it hasn't hit me that it's over. I thought I would be crushed, and there were some lonely moments at the convention that caught me up enough to need a cigarette, but I just feel humiliated. I don't even have the urge to check his Instagram, every time I see a picture of him it just reminds me of how stupid and naive I am for thinking he was my One. I'm also super distrustful of my feelings now because of that... it wasn't a question in my mind when I met him that we'd be together forever. I knew I wanted to spend my life with him, like my name, like a fact. I see cute people out or have great conversations but I have no desire for anything more because I feel like my feelings aren't trustworthy enough to merit acting on them. They led me so far astray last time...

But that's it I guess. It's over and life is going on.

*tl;dr* - We broke up for good.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I remember seeing your original post, and wondering to myself what would happen. You handled this masterfully, and it's obvious you are much better off mentally and emotionally for dropping him from your life. You just sound happier in your writing, and for that I'm glad for you. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other. :)

> **OOP:** Thanks. It creeps me out how quickly he became a stranger, right in front of my eyes... anyway. The convention was helpful for jumpstarting the ole 'single bitch' thing again, haha. That's the path I'll be on for a bit.

Just want to preface by saying I’m aware that this post is gonna sound cringe so I apologize in advance.

There’s this cute girl in one of my classes that I really want to talk to but I don’t really know how to or if it’s even a good idea at all. The thing is that she sits kinda far away from me and everyone pretty much has set seats that they sit at atp and she tends to always sit next to this other girl so I can’t really randomly go sit next to her bc that would just be weird. I was thinking of maybe trying to approach/talk to her one time after class as we’re walking out. But then idk if I should tell her I think she’s cute and ask if she’d be down to grab coffee or just ask her something about class. The latter is obviously more natural but I also feel like if I’m not direct about the fact that I’m interested in her it might just end up as a one time convo and then I wouldn’t know where to go from there.
I realize it probably would’ve been better to try to talk to her in class closer to the beginning of the semester in a casual/friendly way first to gauge if she’d be open to talking to me in general, but I didn’t do that unfortunately and now there’s only 2 weeks left in the sem so I feel like I’d have to be more direct about it.
I’ve looked for similar questions that have been asked in this and other subreddits and there doesn’t really seem to be a consensus as to whether or not it’s an acceptable thing to do. I understand that it can be annoying for women to be approached all the time and I definitely don’t want to make her uncomfortable or make her feel creeped out or anything. Tbh normally I would never do something like this but I’m in my final year at uoft and I’m kinda feeling like I should just do it because you only live once and all that.

Recently, I've started working with a startup in a new city. It's a new world for me, and things are changing. I don't have friends here so I'm basically on my own.

Now, in my company, everyone is almost close knit. The only new joiners are me and a girl (let's call her Bea). Bea has started 2 weeks before me and everyone loves her. We constantly go out for coffee breaks and lunch in groups and I see everyone talking and laughing and enjoying. Bea gets along well with them and she has this fun and bubbly personality that everyone loves. I,on the other hand am an introvert and kinda private person. I love talking too but in this group, I just feel lost. It affects me that I'm not close or important to anyone.

I understand that my own feelings and insecurities have a lot to do with this feeling too. I've tried to journal my thoughts about it but I'm struggling to get over feeling left out and maybe a bit jealous of Bea transitioning so well?

Okay, so back to today. A few days ago I had a very good conversation with the CEO, and other head members of the company. Bea joined in and they all realised how fun she was. They talked about going on a morning walk sometime. They asked me if I'd like to come along with them if they ever plan and I agreed.

This morning I saw pictures of this CEO and head members on the morning walk along with Bea. They shared it in the group. It immediately made me feel really, really bad about myself. 

I know this is not how I should feel. However, I'm struggling to work a way through this feeling of being left out or being the odd one out.

The carriage rides, hosted by The District, returned Nov. 2 for the holidays. The horses and wagons are provided by Cedar Hollow Farms, a family farm operating for over 100 years.

This year, rides have been reduced from 20 minutes to 15 minutes and the route has been adjusted. There are also new additions to the wagons, including an awning. 

The ride starts in the North Village Arts District at the courtyard near Fretboard Coffee and Wishflour Bakery. It continues to the Boone County columns, taking riders past different locations with holiday lights before ending back at the arts district. 

""We always have lines going on (with people) wanting to ride, so we want to make sure we could fit those that wanted to go,"" said Nickie Davis, executive director for The District. 

Last year, a second carriage and two new horses were added due to the event's popularity. The four horses participating in the carriage rides this year are named Bill, Mark, Buster and Dan.

""These are very healthy, very well-cared for animals, and we wouldn't have it any other way,"" Davis said. ""When you see them, you can obviously tell this is their fun job, and they're having fun doing it. They all have personalities, which is hilarious to watch them walk together."" 

Preparing for holiday rides
Planning for The District's holiday events starts in July or earlier, Davis said. 

""We used to have horse-drawn carriages in The District many years ago for different events,"" Davis said. ""We were able to find a company that is local and does them right and takes good care of their animals, and we knew that it seemed like a great fit and something we wanted to bring back to Columbia.""

Ryan Smith, co-owner and head horse handler of Cedar Hollow Farms, said the horses train annually for the carriage rides beginning in April and May.

The horses, which also participate in pulling competitions at state fairs, are exposed to a variety of stimuli including cars, lights, noise, people and traffic to get them comfortable with what they would see and experience in downtown Columbia.

Smith plays music when exercising and training the horses during the summer, mixing in a bit of Jimi Hendrix and songs that might sound unnatural to the horses.

""There is that little bit of barrier so the horses, if they've had enough, can retreat and stay out of range, but when they're wanting the attention they can step up,"" he said.

Smith said the wagons have stairs to load in riders and the seating area is enclosed, which significantly reduces the risk of falling. 

During the rides, the horses wear manure bags to catch their waste and prevent horse manure from ending up on the streets. 

Smith said measures are also taken to ensure the well-being of the horses. He said the horses are given time to run and play to protect their physical and mental health, they are fed the highest quality hay and the time frame for the carriage rides is limited to three hours.

""We have a limited time frame so the horses aren't getting overworked or even standing with their equipment on for too long, because that can cause some discomfort and potentially some abrasions,"" Smith said.

Rides are free and will take place from 4 to 7 p.m. every Saturday in November and every weekend in December until Dec. 22. Riders can arrive as early as 3 p.m. to receive their tickets. Tickets are not available online.

""It's been a huge success,"" Davis said. ""It's just wonderful to watch the little kids come up and pet the horses and just have those first experiences with something like this in their downtown, so it's been really well received, and it's definitely something that we will be continuing to do.""",0,1731732610.0,columbiamo,0,0.5,False

1gsfnbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1gsfnbv/trip_review_tokyo_november_3rd10th_2024/,TRIP REVIEW - Tokyo / November 3rd-10th 2024,"My husband and I traveled to Tokyo for the first time on November 3rd and left late November 10th (Sunday to Sunday). Here's the run-down.

We landed in Haneda airport around 4 PM on Monday and it took about an hour to get through Customs and Immigration. Afterwards, we took the Monorail to our hotel in Taito City. We stayed at The Barn Tokyo, which was in a super nice residential area and was located next to the Uguisudani Station. Note this station is much smaller compared to the other stations - which I feel made navigation a lot easier!

Because we were tired, we walked down the street and tried out one of the konbinis. I got my first onigiri and a few other treats before heading to bed. (Jumbo, my love!)

**Day One (Tuesday) - Shibuya**

We started the day at **Meiji Jingu** around 7:30-8:00 AM. Going in the morning was so peaceful and there weren't that many people around yet. This is a great shrine to visit since it's surrounded by a beautiful forested area and resonates tranquility.

Unfortunately, we had to carve some time out of this day for rest since my husband had some sort of stomach bug/IBS flare-up. If anyone is wondering, look out for[ Seirogan Quick C](https://www.seirogan.co.jp/en/products/quickc/) or [Tomedain](https://www.goodsania.com/products/4987067266104?srsltid=AfmBOopBB_9IGhAHUR99_P-JMgs07esx8GEp4ejLVGRrAskjT_AoqxHX) if you need some gastrointestinal help. (To put it nicely.) Note that you won't be able to find medication in the convenience stores and you'll need to seek out a drug store specifically.

My husband was feeling a little better by evening, so we went to **Shibuya Sky** to check out the view from the top. Note that our tickets were for 6:00 PM and it was already dark by then. So, make sure to go a little earlier during these winter months if you want that sunset view. Although, viewing the city at night is just as cool!

We visited Tower Records and walked around the Shibuya area, then we went to BAKERY RESTAURANT C SHIBUYA. I wanted to include this because the restaurant seemed pretty unassuming - we were just tired and wanted something quick to eat. However, this trip proved that Japanese restaurants are just pure quality. The entry I got with chicken and vegetables was better than most restaurants we could ever get back home. So, *don't worry about choosing a place to eat* \- chances are it's delicious!

\* Side story - My husband didn't want to take the train back to our hotel since he was hiccupping non-stop after dinner and his stomach was still slightly unsettled, so we opted to take an Uber just this once. Unfortunately, our Uber driver ran a red light and was *immediately* pulled over by the police. This made for a rather awkward situation when our Uber driver was trying to talk to the police while my husband continued to hiccup in the backseat. He was extremely apologetic, but it was funnier than anything else!

**Day Two (Wednesday) - Shimo-kitazawa & Ghibli Museum**

The next morning, we headed to Shimo-kitazawa. We went to **Ogawa Coffee Laboratory Shimokitazawa** while we waited for **Shirohige's Cream Puff Shop** to open. We got the Jamaica Blue Mountain Ogawa Plot and the House Blend Kyoto drip coffees along with some of their scones. Let me tell you, this place is top-notch. The House Blend is truly the most balanced cup of coffee I've ever had - so you'll love this cup if you're not big on acidic/funky flavor notes like me. My husband got a bag of the Jamaica Blue Mountain - then we picked up our cream puffs at Shirohige's.

**Note** \- If you only want the cream puffs, just order downstairs at the bakery area. (Walk in, take a left.) There should be no wait, and you can just walk in and out with your pastries. Also note that they only take cash, so make sure to have some on hand.

Our tickets for the **Ghibli Museum** were good for 2:00 PM, so we just walked around Shimo-kitazawa until about 1ish. We found a lot of really fun clothes and souvenirs around this area. They're a little pricey, but I would recommend taking your time to go through the vintage shops if that's your thing. My husband found a really sweet jacket that he later saw someone else wearing on the train. It made for a really fun moment when they both realized they had the same jacket on!

Ghibli Museum - Overall, the Ghibli Museum was pretty cool, but it was also really busy during this time. I'm not sure if it's normally this busy, but I might recommend going a little earlier to beat the crowds. I will say, Mitaka is absolutely beautiful - and we had a great time just walking around the park and enjoying the scenery.

**Day Three (Thursday) - Harajuku & Akihabara**

We started the day at **Cafe Reissue** where we got some fun Kirby and Hello Kitty 3D-art lattes. The lattes weren't anything special, but the artists did a great job of making our drinks look amazing! (Shii and Hada did our drinks when we went.) We went right when they opened (10:00 AM) and there was no wait - that might be different if you go later on in the day though.

Next, my husband had been looking forward to this day all week because he really wanted to visit the **Fender Flagstaff store**. If you like Fenders - this is the place for you. They have multiple floors of guitars and basses, all available to play, along with a gift shop and café. My husband found a beautiful Japanese bass that the store had shipped to our hotel so we wouldn't have to carry it around with us. The staff here speak great English and they were super helpful! We then walked around Harajuku and visited some fun shops like cas:pace, Kiddy Land, etc. Harajuku was super fun, and definitely one of our favorite places we visited!

Finally, we ended the night in Akihabara where we checked out some of the arcades. We tried out GiGO Akihabara 1, but it was mainly crane and mobile games which was a little disappointing. Instead, we went next door to **HEY (Hirose Entertainment Yard)** which was 100x better. They have a ton of vintage and new arcade games, and you can pay with your IC card if you don't have enough coins on hand. We ended the night with some Ichiran in Ueno Park. The line wasn't too bad, we waited maybe about 10 minutes or so. The ramen was really good, even to my husband who normally isn't a fan of tonkatsu broth.

**Day Four (Friday) - Ochanomizu & Asakusa**

My husband needed a sturdier case to transport his bass, so we decided to head to Ochanomizu for its many music stores. If you like records or CDs, there's a Disk Union store in the front of the station that has a really great selection to choose from. We found his case, then headed to Asakusa to check out the UNIQLO store and **Senso-ji** temple. (I'm a huge fan of UNIQLO now.) The temple is beautiful at night, but it was also super busy during this time - so we decided to come back on Sunday morning instead. We had a dinner reservation for **Yakisoba Celona**, which is a teppanyaki-style dinner. It wasn't busy at all when we went around 6:00 PM, and the wagyu and roasted seasonal veggies were delicious. The yakisoba was good, but the slightly crunchy noodles threw me off a little bit.

**Day Five (Saturday)- Mt. Fuji & Hakone**

On Saturday, we got to the station around 7:20 AM to do [this Mt. Fuji tour](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g14133673-d15180540-Mt_Fuji_and_Hakone_1_Day_Bus_Tour_Return_by_Bullet_Train-Nishishinjuku_Shinjuku_.html) on TripAdvisor. It was the perfect day to see Mt. Fuji - the skies were absolutely crystal clear and you could see it from miles away. The tour lasted all day, and we traveled to the Mt. Fuji fifth station, Hakone ropeway, Lake Ashi, and ended with a sake tasting and a bullet train back to Tokyo station. Later that night we decided to head to Shinjuku because we hadn't checked it out yet - and it was pretty insane. I know I've mentioned places being busy in the past, but Shinjuku on a Saturday night was a completely different level. We found some nice gifts at Shinjuku Marui Annex and got some Torikizoku before retiring for the night. 

**Day Six (Sunday) - Wrapping it up Asakusa/Shinjuku/Shibuya**

We wanted to make the most of our last day in Tokyo since our flight left at 6:50ish PM. We revisited Senso-ji in Asakusa earlier in the morning and got our omikuji, then visited Shinjuku and Shibuya for some last minute shopping. I will say, Shinjuku during the day is definitely more my speed. :)

**Weather report** \- The weather during this week was pretty nice. The highs averaged around 61 - 65 F (17-18 C) and felt comfortable with a light sweater/jacket. It only rained once on Sunday.

Additional Tips/Commentary:

1. If you're a dummy like me and forgot to pack pain medicine:

* ""[Eve](https://dokodemo.world/en/item/199503/?srsltid=AfmBOorreaOoTFrwSfDoEo4YdmfMKCi198AmXWyUyz79ffzfYkmTQJnW)"" is the Japanese equivalent of Ibuprofen.
* ""[Bufferin](https://www.bufferin.net/en/)"" is the Japanese equivalent of aspirin.

2. If you can get an eSIM - do it. This made our lives so much easier. We opted for Ubigi and had no issues - opting for 10 GB for 1 month. Even using Google/Apple maps, social media, and streaming videos while we were out, I only used 3 GB at most. (I used our hotel's Wi-Fi at night when we got back though.) We also uploaded our Suica cards to our Apple Wallets. Both these things helped us get out of the airport faster upon arrival.

3. The exit on the bus may be different than where you came in at. For us, the exit was usually located near the middle of the bus. Just look to see where people exit. We found this out the hard way when we went to exit at the front and the bus driver was extremely confused!

4. **Make sure you have cash on you at all times**. My cards stopped working for some reason on the last few hours of our trip, which led to some panic. Thankfully, my husband's debit card still worked, and we were able to get some cash to fuel our time at the airport. However, it's always better to have the cash and not need it, than to not have the cash and need it!

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! Japan is awesome, and I can't wait to go back and explore more of the country outside of Tokyo. I would definitely go longer than a week next time. Let me know if you have any comments or questions!",1,1731732076.0,JapanTravel,0,1.0,False

I figured I’d share my experience, for anyone who’s struggling can relate.
This could fall under Life, but I’ll try to keep it about finance.

As far as career, I work for a big corporation dealing in mainly metal extrusions. We do some aerospace, military work, as well as commercial mainly. 
Being very vague of course.

I have a history of working in logistics, distribution and warehouse management for most of my career. I’m 34.

My wife and I together make over six figures, and it’s still not enough. We are struggling severely for years now.
I’m serious when I say that it’s all bare minimum expenses. We don’t buy anything for ourselves, except maybe a coffee a week.

We both need desperately healthcare and dental work that we can’t afford. Even with insurance.

The costs have become outrageous, and rent and utilities just keep getting raised over and over and over for years now with no let-up.

Idc about politics, as I’ve yet to see anything ever truly change for the betterment of the people in terms of living a balanced, healthy, free life.
It’s all corrupt in my opinion, and won’t change anything drastically enough to matter.

We can’t even afford a gym or any kind of outlet to relieve stress, let alone get time away from work.
Companies are abusing salary workers badly past few years.

Is anyone else struggling this badly? I don’t understand, I guess you have to be making over $500k a year to be middle class.

We work ridiculous amounts of hours a week, barely see each other, and have nothing to show for it.

Should we all just get used to living like wage slaves and having nothing the rest of our lives?",0,1731731905.0,povertyfinance,8,0.11,False

INT. NETFLIX HEADQUARTERS - IT WAR ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a chaotic frenzy of flashing monitors, stressed IT staff, and urgent phone calls. A large screen shows buffering icons, and the deafening buzz of frustration fills the air.

JASON (30s, IT lead)
(holding his head in his hands)
We’re losing them, people! This fight is supposed to be the biggest stream of the year! We’re getting slammed with a flood of complaints!

MIA (late 20s, frantic tech)
(typing furiously)
The servers are collapsing under the load. I've never seen anything like this! It’s like we're streaming a hurricane.

TOM (40s, older, exasperated)
(staring at his screen)
If I see one more “Buffering” message, I’m going to lose it. We need to fix this NOW. Netflix can’t survive a boxing match massacre.

JASON
(urgently into the phone)
Yes, yes, I understand, but we’ve got 10,000 angry subscribers about to riot! Get the backup servers online—NOW!

MIA
(looking over her shoulder)
Uh, the fight’s still in the first round, and we’re losing streamers every second. What happens if we miss the knockout?

TOM
(walking towards them, holding his coffee)
Forget the knockout. I’m already thinking about how I’m going to explain this to the CEO when we get a call at 3 AM.

JASON
(pacing)
We can’t afford to have this go down in history as ""The Fight That Never Happened on Netflix."" We need to bring this back!

The sound of more frustrated exclamations fills the room.

MIA
(sarcastic)
Oh, sure, just casually “bring it back.” You know what’s not coming back? My dignity after we tank this launch.

Jason stares at the screen in horror as a new error message flashes.

JASON
(exasperated)
The stream crashed AGAIN. They’re going to eat us alive on social media for this one!

Tom takes a long sip of coffee, eyes wide.

TOM
(quietly)
This is either the worst night of our lives or a chance for redemption. Let’s make sure it’s the latter.

We were separated for a few months and it seemed like he took any excuse to come by. Like for mail but he wouldn't change his address, forgot something he needed to come back for. Texting me about things unrelated to divorce proceedings. One of the texts was ""Are you just doing everything to avoid me is that it?""

We got back together for a month or two and two weeks ago I found out he lied about a suicide attempt when we were apart, to manipulate me into talking to him again. We got in an argument and I said that was a shitty thing to do, and leave me alone, my trust is gone.

Filed the restraining order two Thursdays ago and starting then he was supposed to stop all contact. He emailed me from a new account but I deleted it unread. Knocked on my door several times during that week. Yesterday was the court hearing... my lawyer who talked to him outsode the courtroom to arrange the agreement for what type of PFA, and for how long, said he was in tears. We settled for one year of no-contact, no-hit. We both signed it. Inside the courtroom the judge told him the penalties if he broke the order, six months in jail and $1000 fine. He said he understood.

The judge said I could leave first and then he would have to wait 10 minutes to leave as well. I had taken an Uber there and I couldn't call for one inside the courthouse since they sealed everybody's phones in these stupid magnetic closed bags that security has to remove at the exit. I was trying to get distance on foot and he literally ran up behind me and tried to beg me to work things out.

His first question was ""are you seeing somebody else?"" And I said no which is the truth. I was in shock like we literally just walked out of the courthouse and you're immediately talking to me?? He asked why my car isn't parked outside the apartment anymore. I've been renting a parking spot three blocks away so he doesn't try to vandalize it and so he'll never know for sure if I'm home or not. He asked where I've been staying. He said the suicide attempt he was talking about was in the past, with his last ex, but I know that's bull because he made it very clear a month ago that this was just recently. Trying to gaslight me until the very end. He said I could call the police on him for talking to me. He told me to remember him and he would still always love me. I said I needed space, that I felt sorry for him, and walked away by myself.

I tried to hide out in a university building near the courthouse but I needed a key card to get in so I walked down to a coffee shop to call an uber and he drove by while I was outside, asking me if I was meeting somebody. I said I was calling for a ride. He said ""let me just drive you back"" and I refused and said I needed space again then he left.

He knocked again on my door tonight after sending me an email, which this time I read before blocking his new account. It was like ""please this is really important please call me.""

At this point I can't even believe this person and I can't even believe myself that I'm too chickens*** not to call the police just because I feel sorry for him. I feel like he'll get the message and give up soon. I wish he would just hate me and call me a lost cause. He always said he would just drop me and block me on everything if I ever pulled out of the relationship. It's like he's losing his mind and I'm scared. I feel sick to my stomach everytime I hear any noise in the hallway and panic when I hear the knocks on the door. I just stay quiet and pretend I'm not home. I'm ashamed of myself.",1,1731731701.0,Stalking,1,0.67,False

Update: One of the managers in our area got fired so my manager got sent to another store and we got a new manager. The new manager is letting me take over the new cooler we have behind the remodel, and I'm trying to get everything together on which vendors carry what items because she's also going to let me handle the orders as well.

I also finally got my promotion to lead CSR!! Obviously I'm very happy about that.

That being said, I have a couple of vendor questions, she's been useless, and I really don't want to reach out to my old manager if I can help it so I'm hoping somebody here might be able to. I have a couple of items, I don't know who delivers them, and I've been trying to catch the vendors to find out but I just can't. So if anybody here happens to know which vendor delivers these items I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me so I could get these order forms set up.

1gsfho6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gsfho6/something_terrifying_is_happening_in_my_house/,Something terrifying is happening in my house,"Hi Reddit, I’m posting my story here because of what is happening in my house. I need help, and I don’t know what to do.
 
I live in Minnesota. I moved here a year ago to start a master’s degree. The area I live in is beautiful, and I have already made a life here. I have great friends, an amazing girlfriend, and there are a lot of opportunities career-wise for when I graduate. This place is my home.
 
I live in a small rental house, just big enough for myself and my cat. It came at a cheap cost, especially considering the area I’m in. Of course, I knew it might be a paranormal red flag, but I took a chance anyways. Honestly, the idea of some activity was comforting in a way. You see, I have been having paranormal experiences since I was five years old. Every place I have ever lived in has had at least some activity, most of it harmless, some not so much. I didn’t get a weird vibe when I toured the place, and at that price, how could I say no?
 
It started off small, as these things tend to do. An object out of place here and there, and my hairbrush went missing only to return a few days later in the exact spot I had left it. Ok, harmless enough, so I left it be.
 
About a month after moving in, a friend I had made in one of my classes came to my place to eat some dinner and have a few drinks to wind down from a busy week. The red wine kept pouring, and soon enough, my friend had to use the restroom. She came back to the living room, laughing slightly. I asked what was funny, and she told me that I was the biggest neat freak she had ever met. I do like to keep things organized, but it’s not obsessive, and I’ve never been called a “neat freak” before. I gave her a quizzical look, and in response, she said, “Oh you know, the way you’ve organized your bathroom”. I kept things set up as most people do, so when I asked her what she meant by “neat freak”, she beckoned me to come look. As I walked into the bathroom, it looked nothing like it had before my friend had come over. Every single thing I kept in my bathroom was lined up in a perfect row, from the biggest item to the smallest. “Oh ha ha”, I said, clearly thinking she had done this as a joke. I didn’t know her all that well after all, so I thought maybe she just had a weird sense of humor. I stared at the formation for one more second, and after an awkward pause, we went back into the living room to finish dinner.
 
Things were quiet for about a week. Then one Saturday morning, I walked to my kitchen to start a cup of coffee. I stopped in my tracks as I saw the silverware. Every utensil I owned was sprawled out on my kitchen table, but not randomly. Every fork, spoon, and knife were in a perfect circle, all pointing inward. A chill crept down my neck. Somehow, this seemed more sinister than a missing hairbrush.
 
Two days after the silverware incident, I came home from class later than usual. I flicked on all the lights, said hello to my cat, and meandered into the living room. I froze. All the cans in my cupboards were stacked, one on top of the other. It looked impossibly tall and definitely not stable enough to hold itself up like it was. My breath caught in my throat as I looked further into my living room. Every piece of furniture downstairs had all been piled up, with one chair sitting on top. It looked like someone had broken in, built a Christmas tree out of furniture, and placed the smallest chair on top, like some fucked-up star. I had heard of these types of hauntings before, but in all my years of attracting entities, this was unlike anything I had ever experienced. Of course, I tried to think of anything logical that could explain this. Maybe someone had broken into my house and played the most insane trick on me, but there was no forced entry, and I had the only key. I took some deep breaths, and reminded myself that I wasn’t being harmed physically, and my cat seemed to be fine, so I took on the long task of undoing everything.
 
I was starting to feel really uneasy being home. Either my cat sensed it, or he was noticing things, too, as he started staring at random corners, tracking things with his eyes. Animals can sense things like that, and again, it wasn’t doing any real harm, so I reassured my cat, and we went to bed.
 
My cat always sleeps next to me, but when I woke up, he wasn’t in the room. Unlike him, but not unheard of. I got out of bed and felt the strong urge to check on my cat. I called his name, looking in every room, until the only room that was left was the kitchen. As I walked in, I screamed. There was my cat, covered in a red goo. My god, I thought, that can’t be blood, please don’t let that be blood. I approached him slowly, he looked at me nervously, but he didn’t seem to be hurt. I examined the substance, only to discover it was ketchup. I opened my fridge, and the ketchup bottle that had been nearly full was almost empty, with the cap still open. Up until now, this entity had only been interacting with inanimate things, but now, it was messing with my cat. I can handle a lot, but when something starts interacting with a living being, I knew that what I was dealing with was no normal entity. Fuck with me, sure, but leave the goddamn cat alone.
 
So I did what I always do with an unwanted visitor, I demanded that it leave and never come back. I told it it was not wanted here and was no longer allowed to be here. Somehow, this only made things worse.
 
I went to bed that night and made sure to lock my cat in my bedroom with me. Telling things to go away usually worked, but this was on a whole other realm. It was the most unrestful night of my life.
 
I woke up groggy the next day, running everything through my head that had happened so far. I needed help, but who could I turn to? As I was brainstorming who might be able to help me (a priest? A psychic?), I walked to my bathroom. I flicked the lights on, and almost screamed in horror. “Staying” was written all over the walls in various substances, from toothpaste to shampoo. I almost fell as I backed out of my bathroom. My eyes scanned every surface of the hallway, the living room walls, and all over the kitchen, only to be met with thousands of “staying” written over and over again. And balanced, perfectly upright on the kitchen table, was my biggest kitchen knife. But that’s not the worst part. Whatever this thing was had ripped a picture of some old friends and me off the wall. It had torn the picture up, leaving only my face intact. The picture of me was speared right through my eye with the tip of the knife.
 
Please Reddit, I don’t know what to do, I don’t even know what I’m dealing with. I don’t think moving out of this house will help. This thing will follow me. The house is not haunted, I am.

# The Mission of a Hat

If a hat is fortunate enough to have excellent craftsmanship and premium materials, it undoubtedly carries an honorable mission: to shield its owner from the wind and rain, ensuring that a worthy head always feels warm and comfortable. However, Brimley seems to have a different calling. In his eyes, riding a stick horse, acting on his own will, and becoming a fog cleaning companion walking the streets alongside Fog Walker Arthur Fog is far more meaningful than simply being a hat.

▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀

# Born with Passion

Brimley was not always a wide-brimmed hat but once a soft felt fedora, a style favored by the middle class of London in the last century. However, his pure Australian wool heritage destined Brimley to become a rugged cowboy, not an elegant and reserved British gentleman. His passion lies in drawing his sword to help the helpless and uphold justice. To assist the weak and fight for what’s right, Brimley is more than willing to spill his blood, never leaving his name behind. Such carefree heroism is the mark of a true hero.

▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀

# A Tough Man Across Any Time or Space

Brimley would rather be disparaged by a hundred media outlets than let anyone see him shout “Kitty, kitty” in a high-pitched voice—this is his creed. Thanks to his steadfast nature and quick-witted speech, Brimley excels in dealing with external communications. However, after becoming the spokesperson for the Foundation’s Australian branch, his heroism has only intensified. At any time, in any place, as long as there are others watching, Brimley will always be the serious and heroic tough man!

I (34F) have been out of the dating pool for a few years. Recently I decided to put myself back out there by downloading a dating app. I spent weeks weeding through what felt like an absolute mad house. Kuddos to people who consistently try to find matches on dating apps. I've never dated online so I'm new to all of this in general.

I finally met a very nice guy (45M). We were chatting all day every day on the app for just under two weeks and then we decided to exchange phone numbers. Then we went to regular texting and talking on the phone multiple times a week. Everything was going well so we decided to meet for coffee. He is also new to dating online. We wanted it to be safe and low risk so we decided to meet somewhere public in the middle of the day. I thought the date went well. He texted me shortly after and told me he had a lot of fun and would be interested in doing it again.  

He is recently divorced and has two small children (ages 3 and 5) that he has joint custody of. I don't have children but I try to be understanding that he has a lot on his plate when he has them.  Although he has lots of family support, I'm sure it can be a lot so I try to be patient when he takes a little longer to respond or if we aren't able to talk on the phone as much when he has them.

It just seems like things have gotten weird in the last two weeks. We haven't talked on the phone at all lately. He's been taking longer than usual to respond to texts and the messages have been much shorter than usual. We also used to send random pictures to each other (selfies or other random stuff that we are doing throughout the day) and those are non-existent lately. 

So naturally I thought he was losing interest and asked him about it. First he said he had a very eventful week planned with the kids (understandable), then the next week he said that he's just been crazy busy at work which resulted in going home and passing out. He has been pretty reassuring with his texts. He often tells me he misses me and he's thinking about me. When I brought up my concerns,  he seemed receptive (not defensive) about it, apologized, gave lots of reassurance that he's still interested, and gave a pretty detailed explanation. On one hand, I want to believe that this is just a natural part of dating and that communication starts to slow down once the ""newness"" wears out. On the other hand, I'm worried that his slow decline in communication is actually a loss of interest that he isn't being honest about. I worry about coming off as nagging by asking him about it again for the third week in a row. I really like him a lot and I want to continue what we have, but I also feel like we aren't really making any progress at this point. I asked if we could meet again and he said he would have to look at his schedule and get back with me, which he didn't. I'm not sure if I should bring that up. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this? I'm not expecting anyone to have a clear answer as to what is happening here because really only he knows that. But maybe someone has been in a similar situation and wouldn't mind sharing their experience?  Should I wait it out a little longer and see if things get better? Or is it likely that he's stringing me along and it's time to cut ties? Thanks in advance!

TLDR: I met a guy on a dating app and we met once in person. Things started off well with lots of phone calls and text messages, but now we aren't making progress because he says he's been really busy. Should I wait it out or leave?

1gsfczk,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1gsfczk/in_depth_description_on_the_maximum_speed/,In Depth Description on the Maximum Speed Possible in Stardew Valley 1.6! (Calculated) (Major Spoiler!),"As stated above, I calculated the maximum speed you could possibly get if you got lucky enough to get at the same time. 

Let's start with the fastest you can possibly go. You, as a player, have a base walking speed of 2, and a running speed of 5. Most people know that you can drink a coffee/triple shot espresso to get a +1 buff. You are also able to eat food item, such as crab cakes or spicy eel, to get a +1 buff as well. This adds up to a total of 7 running speed and 4 walking speed. And you can also get a +0.1 buff from walking on paths out on the farm. Leaving the max walking speed at 4.1 if you were still on version 1.5.6. But that's not all. Next up, we have the horse, which gives a +1.6 buff while on the horse. If you also have the Savage Ring from completing the Void Spirits slayer goal, you get +2 speed when you get a crit on an enemy. But this only lasts 3 seconds, so this has to be last. Leaving the max speed in 1.5.6 to 10.7 total. 

With 1.5.6 in the past, now we move onto the speed possible in 1.6, which is a lot. To start, there is a new shop that becomes available once every season, the bookseller. Here, you can get 3 books that add to your speed; Way of the Wind Pt. 1, Way of the Wind Pt. 2, and Horse: The Book. The Way of the Wind books both give a +0.25 speed boost each, adding 0.5 total to the score. The Horse: The Book gives a +0.5 boost to the +1.6 boost already given while on a horse. This new total, including the stuff only available in 1.5.6, adds up to a total of 11.7 total possible speed so far, or a +6.7 boost to the base 5 running speed. Next, there is a new festival, the Desert Festival. Here, you get a couple buffs. First, if you go to the cook to the far left of the desert, you get a free meal. You can choose any of the first items, just as long as you get the Uncomfortably Hot Sauce with it, you will get another +1 buff. Then, if you go into the Skull Caverns, there will be tall and lanky cat statues, where when you interact with them, you have a chance to get the speed buff of +1 as well. Next we have the Statue of Blessings that you get the recipe for when you get the Farming Mastery from the mastery cave. The Statue of Blessings has a chance to give you a speed buff for the day, which gives you a +0.5 boost. Lastly, there's these new items called Trinkets. These can be obtained from the Combat Mastery in the mastery cave. One of these Trinkets is called The Golden Spur, and it gives a +1 boost when landing a critical hit on an enemy, lasting for only 10 seconds if it has been re-forged to the best option. This leaves our total, after adding up the last 4 things, bringing another +3.5 to the previous total of 11.7, to the new and highest number, of 15.2 total speed. This is more than triple the normal running speed, and almost 8 times the normal walking speed! And yes, this speed is indeed possible all at the same time and is all obtainable in vanilla and without cheats. It just needs insane timing. 

I hope all you speed lovers appreciate this post, because I sure will. And I might even calculate the slowest plausible speed in Stardew Valley. Oh and for the speed you can have for longer than just 3 or 10 seconds adds up to a total of 12.2 speed for 5 minutes at most.",1,1731731031.0,StardewValley,1,1.0,False

Well I was just sitting and i guess i've somehow been in a really good space to reflect on things? And after reflecting I realized some of my trains of thoughts are bordering on concerning again and.... not the first time its been concerning... but at least I noticed it?

This past week: I got some name written at a drive through that accidentally was the same as a local politician that won, relative ordered a drink and it matched the color their political party is associated with.... thus the people at the drive through are saying they know I'm secretly more liberal than I tell others I am? Thing is the drink was weird and on their website they didnt offer it at drive throughs + it wasnt what was ordered at all. (kinda worried this is going to dox me).

But thats a weird train of thought...+ recently, idk i just had a couple days where I was straight up hyper, perhaps due to coffee. I made a comment that something i did was connected to something they did, and they just straight up told me it was really unrelated. Which, looking back at it, that person was right. I was being weird. 

And.... once in a while I noticed that i keep feeling random things are directed at me(and have occasionally been told i assume too much or something along those lines). Which.. isnt good... but then its going down some really bad path then. Which I ideally need to stop. I'll bring it up with someone, I have some options.

I need to just get out of this, i thought I did? I mean weeks prior I was really into spiritual stuff like obvessively maybe, chalked that up to adhd hyperfixation issues. I mean this whole thing could blossom into something worse, couldnt it? like, it could easilly afaik. I keep getting some paranoia issues as well, some just have reoccuring themes that just die down and pop back up after a while.

Im guessing the best course of action is just to not give meaning to the weird stuff and talk to someone about it whos a professional...? (Issue is i'll think its an issue, start working towards doing something about that, then realize I'm just overreacting and making mountains out of molehills... which im sure isnt true, its an actual issue nontheless...im likely just minimizing the issue)

I'm guessing I just did the opposite of that and went down a bad path with spirituality and other such things...

Oh also I felt a massive random switch/wave in ""oh hey I need to follow certain dietary rules of a religion im not actually part of, but my parents kinda taught me some dietary rules that were part of it"". Like random religiosity in a way? As soon as I tried to get out of being really into spirituality.",2,1731730773.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False
