Recently I saw a reddit user mention about an app called ATTAPOLL. It pays for finishing surveys, games and tasks. 

Surveys are usually small once only... I usually does surveys and tasks which daily give me around $3-$4, which inturn i use for everyday snacks and coffee.... 

So it feels like for a month I don't actually spend my own money for such things. 

But yea, you can't be super rich... But yea.. you can make money... The app linknis below... If you feels it's shady, you can google or download through playstore too... It works for me well

1ni7fkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1ni7fkx/is_a_powerful_blender_worth_it_for_smoothie_lovers/,Is a powerful blender worth it for smoothie lovers?,"Hey everyone! I've been making smoothies daily for about 3 years now, and I wanted to share my experience with blenders since I see this question pop up pretty often here.

When I first started my smoothie journey, I was using a cheap $30 blender from Walmart. You know, one of those that struggle with frozen fruit and leave chunks of spinach floating around. After dealing with chunky smoothies and burning through two cheap blenders, I finally decided to invest in a high-quality one.

Let me tell you - it was a game-changer. The difference is like night and day. My morning smoothies are now silky smooth, and I can blend literally anything: frozen fruits, tough greens, nuts, seeds, you name it. No more picking kale pieces out of my teeth!

What really surprised me was how much more I could do beyond smoothies. I'm making nut butters, hot soups, frozen desserts, and even grinding coffee beans. The powerful motor handles everything like a champ, and I don't have to worry about it burning out.

I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/blender

The initial cost might seem steep, but think about it this way: I was replacing my cheap blender every 6-8 months. A quality blender has already lasted me two years with zero issues. Plus, the warranty on these machines is usually pretty solid.

Some key benefits I've noticed:
- Saves time (blends everything in under a minute)
- No more chunks or uneven texture
- Can handle hot and cold ingredients
- Much quieter than cheaper models
- Actually saves money long-term

If you're serious about making smoothies regularly, a powerful blender is definitely worth the investment. You'll use it more often because it works better, and you'll probably expand into making other healthy stuff too.

For anyone interested in checking out some reliable options, here's that link again: https://athometouch.com/blender

Just my two cents, but I wish someone had told me this when I first started. Would've saved me some money and frustration in the long run. Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow smoothie enthusiasts!

By the way, what's your favorite smoothie recipe? I'm always looking to try new combinations!",1,1757995318.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False
1ni7f77,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1ni7f77/what_is_this_white_chocolate_powder_helppp/,WHAT is this White Chocolate Powder :(? Helppp.,"Hi everyone. This is the second time I've posted about this, and I'm afraid I'm running out of options.

I'm trying to find out what white chocolate powder this Blends Coffee cafe uses. I called twice, and they said they couldn’t share it because of company policy. The closest information they provided was that it came in a silver bag with the coffee shop's name on it. If it's an original mix, I don't think there's anything I can do to get it.. and I don't think the next time I go there (and it's a resort so we visit it once in a while) they would let me buy a bag lol.

I’ve tested a few powders already. Ghirardelli tasted a little bit artificial and didn’t melt smoothly. Hollander was closer, but still not right, and melted a bit easier. Gosh That’s Good White Chocolate Sugar-Free Powder had a bad aftertaste, didn't melt in the iced coffee, and wasn't it either (this one was the worst and highly disappointing considering how many people were praising it.)

The Blends powder makes the drink rich, creamy, and sweet without being overpowering, and it dissolves easily in coffee. The more of the powder you add, the sweeter the drink gets. It is very, very smooth. That is the closest that I can get to describing it. It's SOOO addicting and good, like it tastes so gourmand.

Does anyone here work at a Blends Coffee or know what white chocolate powder they use, or have any tips on how I can figure it out? :( I have searched everywhere online.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/1nbxi1v/help_the_moms_of_the_bride_and_groom_are_ccing_me/)**: September 8, 2025**

I run a small graphic design business. Weddings are easily my best-paying gigs and also the ones that make me question my life choices. About 70% of couples are totally fine, and then there is that 30% that makes me want to give it all up and become a greeter at Walmart. Today’s situation is shaping up to be one of those.

This morning I got an email from “Lisa” (bride’s mom, fake name, don’t come at me). She had seen my work from another wedding and asked about packages, dates, etc. I sent her my intro email and standard questionnaire, which covers things like what they need, their aesthetic, and names of the wedding party, etc. I do not give quotes until I get that back.

Not even an hour later, I got another email from someone else asking about the exact same date. Same process: I sent my intro email and the questionnaire.

I went out for a walk, came back, and my inbox had turned into a dumpster fire. It seems both “Lisa” and “Betty” (the groom’s mom) are trying to hire me for the same wedding. That's fine, but they both have strong opinions about what is supposed to happen, and instead of privately hashing this out, they decided to copy me on their argument.

The questionnaire asks for correct spellings of the wedding party’s names. This somehow spiraled into an all-out war about whose name should go first on the invitation. Groom’s mom says since they are paying for more, the groom’s name should be first. Bride’s mom is horrified because “tradition.”

For the record, I never asked who goes first. I just follow the traditional format unless it is a same-sex union, where I ask. But now both moms are mad at me because they demanded I settle the argument, and I politely suggested maybe they leave me out of it.

This is just the invitations. Good grief, I can't imagine how stressful the rest of this wedding is going to be.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: If they can't figure it out without involving you, then you should fire them. Imagine the rounds of back and forth and changes you're going to get from this. Hours of these shenanigans await you with this group. And they'll hassle you about the revision costs. \[...\]

>**OOP:** I already decided to fire them. It's not worth the headache. I'm just floored that this of all things is the hill that they are willing to die on.  
The argument is still going on and I am still cc'ed in the email even though I sent them both my standard, ""Thank you but no thank you"" letter.  
I feel bad for the bride and groom.

Commenter: It’s so weird that happy couple hasn’t contacted you themselves. Are they aware that mums are planning a wedding???

>**OOP:** Honestly, it's not as weird as you might think. This is not the first (nor do I think it will be the last) time someone besides the bride has contacted me. I had a granny hire me once, and she was hysterically funny to work with.  
***Editor's note:*** *Can confirm. Currently planning my own wedding. My mom, with my permission of course and with my thoughts, reached out to the florist for me since I was feeling overwhelmed with work and wedding stuff.*

Commenter: Also here for the Granny story.

>**OOP:** She was in her 80s and knew all the family tea and enjoyed sharing said tea. She and the bride were extremely close and it was the perfect example of how these 3rd party orders can and should go. Ended up doing multiple jobs for her before she passed including a couple more weddings.

Commenter: So, if you mailed them individually and separately, how did they both end up on the same mail chain with you to see them bicker?

>**OOP:** One of the mom’s emailed the other to tell her she had hired me (which she hadn’t, she had just requested a quote.) Mom 2 had already emailed me and had the same info as Mom 1. Guess they decided to answer the questionnaire together and then chaos ensued.  
I wasn’t cc’d until multiple replies deep and immediately thought “yeah, this one is going to be a nightmare”. Honestly, I read the first two lines of that email and decided it wasn’t worth the headache.  
I find it hysterical that these grown ass adult women had nothing better to do on a Monday morning than argue about name placement on an invitation.  
But I’m all for the entertainment so I made sure to share the insanity here.

**Update (Same Post): September 9, 2025 (Next Day)**

**UPDATE: The saga continues… kind of.**

Yesterday afternoon I sent out my standard “sorry, I won’t be able to work with you on this project” email to both moms. Since I work in a pretty niche area, the email basically says, “Due to scheduling issues, I can’t take on your wedding, but here are some vendors who might be able to help.”

Now, I keep two versions of that vendor list. One is the “A-list” of people I personally know the quality of their work and would vouch for their professionalism and creativity. The other is more of a “good luck, godspeed” list with places like Vistaprint and Etsy. I’ll let you guess which one they got.

After sending, I wrote a quick Outlook rule to shuttle their emails into a folder, then moved on with my day. Okay, I also shared the story with you guys, but then I really did go back to work.

Fast forward to this morning. I’m drinking my coffee, scrolling through your comments, and I decide to peek at that folder. **Seventeen new emails. Seventeen.**

And because I’m nosy, of course I read them. Here are a few gems:

* **Groom’s Mom:** “You don’t understand how this works; I pay, and I get what I want.”
* **Bride’s Mom:** “But it’s tradition.” (She wrote this *nine* times.)
* **Groom’s Mom:** “Nobody knows your name; they know ours.” (I don’t know them either, but sure, okay.)
* **Bride’s Mom:** “Where is this girl? She should be answering our questions!” (For the record, “this girl” is a 58-year-old professional who owns a business. Thanks for the respect.)

There was also some very creative name-calling that I won’t repeat here.

Before anyone asks, I won’t be responding to that email chain. Confidentiality is part of what I promise to clients, but that only starts after a signed contract. If you act a fool before that, well… the internet gets the story.

At this point I just hope the couple cuts the cords, grabs a ladder, and elopes. I don’t know either of these families personally, so this is probably where my updates end.

***One of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I’m in an adjacent business- almost all B2B. I’ll do stuff for non business functions once in a while but have a hard NO on weddings. Because I don’t want to question my life choices.

I realized how much I like quiet, as in dead silence. Living at home, I can go days without hearing *anything* and that’s something I can’t find here. Parks, libraries, “quiet” spots. No matter the time of day you will always hear *something* be it distant cars, AC or other people. It is also literally brighter for many of the same reasons.

I’ve learned that I only go to a few places. I find a coffee shop I like and I just keep going there. I find a park I like and do the same. I don’t like how much stuff there is. As weird as it is to say about a city, there are a lot of buildings. Some stand out, even ones that seem ordinary, but most are just visual noise. I do like cities, but ones with lower density. If you’ve ever been to DC you’ll know what I mean. I learned how much I don’t like sketchy areas. While I’ve gotten used to it, I can’t shake the constant vigilance of knowing my surroundings. It’s not at all overbearing, but I liked when I could blissfully and truly mindlessly go places. 

All of this is still offset by the fact that I can choose to not own a car. I get to ride the train often and I get to go to very different places without traveling far. Driving is so painful and draining that my life is measurably better despite the flaws. For me, I think it is best to live in a connected town with its own main street on the edge of cities, rather than in them.

I couldn’t go shopping for work clothes today because I thought I wouldn’t have time before I needed to dress up and leave. 5 min before arriving at the coffee shop, I get a text from her that she needs to reschedule our meet up to maybe a day later this week. But she didn’t apologize for letting me know last minute. She said her excuse was that she needed to visit the person who did her belly button piercing the other day because it started to hurt her, and she wouldn’t be home until 5 p.m. and needed the next day to work on school stuff. 

I understand that things can come up last minute but it kinda sucked that it had to be minutes before I arrived at the place as I had to make a detour due to construction near my house. What sucks more is that she keeps engaging in the main group chat with people venting about their lives and all minutes/ to an hour before and after she texted me that she couldn’t make it. It seems like she’s not too interested in being my friend or feels like she has to be because the whole group chat was made by the intention of meeting girls in our area easier. 

She mentioned something within that hour later agreeing to something another girl said in the group chat about how they’re bored and wishes to be intimate with their boyfriend and then finding things to distract themselves. That made me feel off like we could have met an hour later (as I went to do errands anyways after getting a coffee for myself cause I didn’t make the trip for nothing). Maybe she was burnt out idk but I feel like I want to talk to her about it but we just met so it’s not like a deeper level friendship yet even when I placed boundaries like “hey if Friday works just let me know the morning of.” 

Should I even bother continuing this friendship? I know people make mistakes and don’t realize how it hurts the other person in a way, but I would’ve brushed it off if she didn’t engage in the group chat minutes later for hours. I don’t know what to do. I feel like i’m overthinking this a lot since her excuse is valid as she mentioned yesterday that she had to skip a workout bc she was afraid of her piercing area getting infected even tho she feels like it’s fully healed. I just feel like it’s a sign that she’s a flaky person with that being a first impression.

Day 30 today, and this is my first time doing 75 Hard. I’ve never stuck with any routine this long (usually quit around day 7–10), so just showing up every day feels like a win.

Physically - Not much change yet. I’ve dropped ~3–4 lbs (from ~55kg to ~53kg; I’m 154 cm F), but no big difference in belly fat or progress pics. Workouts have mostly been walks, yoga, and light jogs - no strength training yet, which I think is why the progress is slow.

Diet’s been decent: no refined sugar/processed food, switched up coffee orders, even skipped cake at a birthday (huge for me, cakes and donuts made me so happy lol). I still bake desserts at home with honey/maple syrup.

The real wins so far:
- Drinking water daily (way fewer headaches)
- Better mood & motivation (still many low days, but I get up and do things)
- Self-control (mid-work sweet treats were my weakness)
- Actually finishing books (!!)

I’ll admit, when I see people’s 30-day progress pics with dramatic changes, I get a little discouraged. But I also get it - they’ve been grinding hard, and my workouts have been lighter. So for me, the biggest change right now is consistency, and that feels huge on its own.

Planning to keep going and add more protein + strength training. 

For those who didn’t see results at 30 days - did things pick up later, or was it mostly mental wins for you too?

Choose settings for dates that feel natural, like a quiet coffee shop or a walk in a park, where you can connect without distractions. Don’t rush to force a spark; real bonds take time to grow through shared moments and mutual respect. Set clear boundaries to protect your emotional space, and don’t be afraid to walk away if someone’s intentions feel shallow. Seek people who value vulnerability and consistency as much as you do, and let go of those who play games or push for quick fixes. Above all, trust your instincts.

I’d budget like crazy for two weeks, then completely blow it on a night out or some impulse buy, and the whole system would collapse.

The mistake? I was trying to track every penny instead of focusing on the big wins. When you micromanage $3 coffees but ignore the hundreds disappearing into random subscriptions, bad car loans, or eating out five times a week, it’s no wonder the budget doesn’t stick.

What finally clicked for me was flipping the script. Instead of asking, “How do I cut more?” I started asking, “How do I make this work with my actual lifestyle?” I built a budget that felt realistic, not perfect. I automated savings first, then let the rest flow into categories that mattered. The funny thing is, once I stopped treating budgeting like punishment, I finally started sticking to it.

If you’re struggling with budgeting, don’t beat yourself up. Most advice out there is one-size-fits-all and doesn’t work for real life. I broke down what worked for me in more detail in a resource, it’s in my bio if anyone’s interested.",1,1757994472.0,budget,1,1.0,False

1ni713i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lipbusycare/comments/1ni713i/does_thai_tea_contain_caffeine_everything_you/,Does Thai Tea Contain Caffeine? Everything You Need to Know,"# Does Thai Tea Contain Caffeine?

Yes, Thai tea does contain caffeine. Thai tea is traditionally made from strongly brewed black tea, mixed with spices, sugar, and condensed milk. Since black tea is the main ingredient, it naturally contains caffeine.On average, **a cup of Thai iced tea has about 30–60 mg of caffeine per 8 oz serving**, depending on how strong the tea is brewed.

# Thai Tea Caffeine vs. Coffee and Other Teas

* **Thai Tea: 30–60 mg caffeine (per 8 oz)**
* **Regular Black Tea: 40–70 mg**
* **Green Tea: 25–45 mg**
* **Coffee: 95–200 mg**

👉 Compared to coffee, Thai tea has less caffeine, but still provides a gentle energy boost.

# Factors That Affect Caffeine in Thai Tea

  **1.Brew Strength** – The longer the black tea steps, the higher the caffeine.  **2.Serving Size** – A large Thai iced tea (16 oz) can contain **60–120 mg** of caffeine.  **3.Tea Leaves Used** – Authentic Thai tea mixes with black tea have more caffeine than herbal substitutes.

# Does Thai Milk Tea Have the Same Caffeine?

Yes, Thai milk tea also contains caffeine, since it’s made with the same black tea base. The milk and sugar don’t reduce caffeine content, but they can make the drink feel smoother and less bitter.

# Who Should Limit Thai Tea Caffeine?

* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women** – recommended to limit caffeine to under 200 mg/day.
* **People sensitive to caffeine** – may experience jitteriness, insomnia, or rapid heartbeat.
* **Children** – should avoid caffeinated drinks.

# Decaf or Herbal Alternatives

If you love the flavor of Thai tea but want to avoid caffeine, you can:

* Try **decaf black tea blends**
* Use **rooibos or herbal tea as a caffeine-free base**
* Look for **Thai tea flavored mixes** without black tea

# Final Thoughts

So, does Thai tea contain caffeine? **Yes, it does — usually around 30–60 mg per cup.** While it’s not as strong as coffee, Thai tea can still give you a refreshing energy lift. If you enjoy the rich, creamy flavor of Thai iced tea but want to reduce caffeine, consider smaller servings or herbal alternatives.

Not because someone said it. Not because of a name tag. But because the walls knew it—the floors, the air, the vacancy sign still flickering in the window. As if the building had been waiting for you.

And what if—just imagine—you were warned not to answer a phone that doesn’t ring for people, or not to look into a mirror because it might reflect more than your own face? Would you stay?

Yeah… I did.

And my name is Cody. I was the night receptionist for a hotel called The Hollow Pines Inn—a place buried so deep in the woods it practically exists off the grid. There’s a town around it—Maple Glade—but calling it a town is generous. It’s one road in, one road out, no streetlights, and the kind of cell service that dies the second you say, “Hello?”

From the outside, it looks like the kind of place someone’s grandmother might run—peeling white paint, wraparound porch with a crooked swing, and a little fountain that burbles but never flows. Quaint. Quiet. Dead quiet.

But inside? Inside, the place watches you back.

I started my shift on a Friday night. One night. That’s all I lasted. And looking back… lasting even one feels like a miracle.

I showed up around 10:30 PM. Shift was 11 to 7. A man greeted me in the lobby—Mr. Granger, the manager. Short, stiff posture like someone carved him from oak. His eyes were this cloudy, pale blue—the kind of eyes you see on a fish left too long on ice. And his smile didn’t match the rest of his face. It looked... rehearsed.

“You ever work nights before, son?” he asked as he handed me a ring of heavy iron keys. No electronic fobs, no codes—just iron.

“Not really,” I said. “But I don’t mind the hours.”

He gave me this slow nod, then gestured toward the front desk. “Everything you need’s there. Coffee in the back. Cot if you get tired. And no check-ins after midnight.”

I forced a laugh. “Easy enough.”

He didn’t laugh back. He didn’t even blink. Instead, he reached into the drawer behind the desk and pulled out something thick and glossy—a laminated sheet, yellowing at the corners. Eleven rules. Printed in bold, black, government-type font. The last one? Double bold. All caps. Like it was the only one that really mattered.

The Rules of The Hollow Pines Inn – Night Shift

1. Lock the front doors at exactly 11:01 PM. Not a minute before. Not a minute after.
2. If the lobby phone rings and there’s no one in the lobby, do NOT answer it.
3. If a guest named “Mr. Black” asks for a room, tell him we are full—even if we are not.
4. Between 2:13 AM and 2:27 AM, you may hear a baby crying from Room 204. Do NOT go up there. No one is in that room.
5. If you see a woman in a green dress staring through the front window, do NOT make eye contact. Turn off the lobby lights until she leaves.
6. The mirror in the hallway by Room 108 will show things that aren’t there. Avoid looking at it after 3 AM.
7. Never go into Room 103. It is always vacant. It must stay that way.
8. If the power goes out, don’t panic. Stay behind the front desk and keep your eyes on the service bell. If it rings, someone is trying to come through.
9. At exactly 4:44 AM, you may hear someone whisper your name. Do not respond. Even if it sounds like your mother.
10. Do not, under any circumstance, take the elevator between 1:30 AM and 2:00 AM.
11. If you break a rule, apologize out loud. Say: “I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.” Then pray it’s enough.

I remember staring at that list and thinking it was a joke. Some twisted hazing ritual for new employees. But Mr. Granger wasn’t joking. He never cracked a grin, never explained a thing. Just handed it to me like it was the Ten Commandments, then left without another word.

At 11:01 sharp, I turned the bolt on the front doors. And as the click echoed through the empty lobby, it felt… final. Like the building had just inhaled me.

That was the last moment things felt normal.

What happened next? Well… it wasn’t one big event. It was a slow unraveling of reality—a string of impossible moments stitched together by fear, and every rule I almost broke.

Because some rules? They're written for legal safety. But these... These were written in blood and survival.

Want to know what I saw when the lights flickered at 1:42 AM? Or who called the lobby phone even though the line had been dead for years?

Then stay tuned—because once you start this story…You’re already inside The Hollow Pines Inn.

And it’s already watching you.

I chuckled—nervously, mostly—and held up the laminated sheet like it was a script from a prank show. “Is this some kind of weird initiation?” I asked, half expecting a camera crew to pop out from behind the vending machine.

But Mr. Granger didn’t flinch. Didn’t smirk. Didn’t say a word, really.

He just gave me a hard stare and muttered, “Good luck.”

And then he left.

No goodbyes. No instructions. No car keys.

He walked right out the front door and disappeared into the woods—on foot. No flashlight. No coat. Just vanished into the black pines like he belonged to them.

I stood there, staring at the door, wondering what kind of place I’d just signed up for. I didn’t know it then, but that was my first mistake—watching him leave instead of watching the clock.

At exactly 11:00 PM, I stood up, walked to the front doors, and waited.

One minute passed.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

11:01.

I twisted the deadbolt until it clicked. The sound echoed—loud, final, almost like locking a cage.

I stood there for a moment. Listening. The hotel was silent—eerily so. No cars outside. No wind. Just the soft hum of the old overhead lights.

Nothing happened.

So I breathed out, sat down behind the desk, and flicked on the dusty TV mounted in the corner. Static buzzed for a second before settling on a local news channel where nothing important was happening—just weather maps and somebody’s tractor accident.

It was peaceful. Too peaceful.

The next hour passed uneventfully. Two guests came down in slippers, yawning, asking about snacks. I helped them get some candy from the jammed vending machine, made a joke about it eating dollars, and sent them back upstairs.

If anything, the place just felt… old. Empty. A little sad. But safe.

That changed at 12:43 AM.

The phone on the desk rang.

Not a cell. Not the back office. The lobby phone.

That old beige landline with the spiral cord and stick-on number tag. It buzzed against the wood like it was vibrating from inside the desk itself.

I looked around instinctively. The lobby was completely empty. Not a single soul in sight. No footsteps. No voices. No guests wandering down for late-night coffee.

And that’s when it hit me. Rule #2.

If the lobby phone rings and there’s no one in the lobby, do NOT answer it.

I froze.

There’s a strange kind of fear that sits just behind your ribs—a cold, squeezing pressure. That’s what I felt right then. It crept in like smoke under a locked door.

I should have let it ring.

I really should’ve.

But curiosity—that devil wearing a friendly face—got the better of me.

“It’s just a phone call,” I whispered. “What’s the worst that could happen?”

And I picked it up.

“Hollow Pines Inn, front desk.”

Silence. Not just on the line—in everything.

The room seemed to go still. The air stopped moving. Even the buzzing light overhead quieted like it was holding its breath.

“Hello?” I said again, softer.

Then I heard it.

Not a voice. Not even a whisper.

Breathing.

Wet. Ragged. As if someone was gasping through phlegm, each inhale bubbling like it came from a flooded lung.

But the worst part? It wasn’t coming through the earpiece.

It was coming from beneath the desk.

Right beneath me.

My throat constricted as I forced myself to clean it, stumbling back with the phone still clutched in my hand. I dropped it—let it smack hard against the wood—and stared under the desk.

Nothing.

No one.

Just shadows and wires and a faint, sour smell that hadn’t been there before.

The line clicked dead.

I’d broken the rule.

And suddenly, I remembered #11.

If you break a rule, apologize out loud. Say: ""I acknowledge my mistake. It won't happen again."" Then pray it's enough.

I didn’t wait.

My voice came out dry and cracked.

“I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.”

The lobby stayed still. No lights flickered. No breathing returned. No phantom figures crawled out of the darkness.

But something had shifted.

The air pressed in around me—thicker, heavier, charged like the atmosphere right before a lightning strike.

And deep inside the building, I swear—I swear—I heard a door click open.

Somewhere I hadn't touched.

At exactly 1:10 AM, the front doors—the ones I had locked without fail at 11:01—suddenly shuddered like something massive had thrown its weight against them.

I looked up.

There he was.

A man—if you could call him that—tall, gaunt, and motionless, standing just inches from the glass. His coat was black, long, too heavy-looking for someone with such a narrow frame. His skin looked... wrong. Too pale. Almost blue. Like snow packed over dead flesh.

And his face?

No eyebrows. No hair. Just two coal-dark eyes and a mouth that moved slowly.

He didn’t knock. Didn’t speak.

He only mouthed the words: ""Room, please.""

My throat dried out instantly. My fingers found the laminated rule sheet and gripped it like a lifeline. Rule #3 burned in my mind:

If a guest named ""Mr. Black"" asks for a room, tell him we are full, even if we are not.

I reached for the desk mic, hand trembling. The air felt sharp now—like it had grown teeth.

I pressed the button. My voice came out too soft at first. I cleared it—forced it—and tried again.

“Sorry, sir. We’re full tonight.”

The man didn’t move.

He just tilted his head—just slightly—and smiled. A tight, crooked, sliver of a smile, like someone learning how to do it for the first time.

Then, without turning, he walked away. Backwards.

Not shuffled. Not stumbled.

Walked backward—clean, steady steps—into the darkness, swallowed by the treeline like he belonged to the woods.

I sat frozen, eyes locked on the now-empty doorway. I don’t know how long I stared before a sound yanked me back to reality.

Ding.

The elevator.

I hadn’t touched it. No one had.

But the doors slid open all the same—slow, mechanical, and perfectly on time.

I looked at the clock.

1:29 AM.

And my blood went cold.

Rule #10: Do not, under any circumstance, take the elevator between 1:30 AM and 2:00 AM.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. I just stared as the doors hung open, revealing nothing but a flickering light and an empty floor.

For a moment, I thought that was it. That the elevator would close and I could forget it ever happened.

But at 1:34, she stepped out.

A woman.

Long black hair hanging down in soaked strands like seaweed. Skin pale like parchment. She wore a thin dress, like something meant for a hospital bed, and her eyes—God, her eyes—were too wide, too alert, stretched open like they were stuck that way.

She never looked at me.

She simply walked across the lobby, silent, bare feet touching down like feathers, and vanished into the hallway toward the guest rooms.

No footsteps. No sound at all. Like she floated more than walked.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even dare blink. Because something in my bones told me that if I did, she’d stop. And turn. And look.

At 2:13 AM, the next horror arrived—not through the door or the elevator, but through the walls.

It started soft.

A baby crying.

High-pitched. Muffled. Like it was buried behind drywall.

At first, I thought it might be a guest—maybe someone left a baby monitor on too loud.

But the sound grew sharper. Angrier.

More desperate.

I checked the guest ledger.

Room 204 was empty.

And that’s when the rule came back to me—sharp and cold like a nail driven into the back of my skull.

Between 2:13 and 2:27 AM, you may hear a baby crying from Room 204. Do NOT go up there. No one is in that room.

I gripped the desk. My nails dug into the wood.

Still, part of me—some part wired wrong by empathy or madness—wanted to help. To run upstairs and pound on that door. To hold something. Save something.

But I didn’t move.

Because this wasn’t a child. This was a trap.

And the crying—God help me—it got worse.

By 2:20, it had morphed into a shriek. Like the baby was being pulled apart, each wail sharper than the last, turning into something not human at all.

My ears rang. My eyes stung. I felt the tears trying to come but I blinked them back. Because whatever that thing was, it wanted me emotional. It wanted me soft.

But I sat still.

Stiffer than a corpse.

And then—at exactly 2:27—

Silence.

Like someone flipped a switch. Not even an echo remained.

And that silence?

It wasn’t comforting.

It was watching me.

Waiting.

Because The Hollow Pines Inn… it hadn’t finished yet.

Not even close.

I was just starting to breathe again—just letting the tension slip from my shoulders— when the lights died.

No flicker. No warning.

Just a hard snap into total darkness— the kind of dark that feels alive.

I couldn’t see my hands. Couldn’t see the desk. Couldn’t see anything.

Just black—absolute and suffocating.

But I remembered.

Rule 8: If the power goes out, don’t panic. Stay behind the front desk and keep your eyes on the service bell. If it rings, someone is trying to come through.

So I didn’t move.

Not a muscle.

I kept my back straight, eyes wide, locked on where the bell sat—even though I couldn’t see it, I stared like I could. Like it would protect me if I just believed hard enough.

And then it rang.

One clear ding.

Sharp. Piercing. Right in front of me.

I froze.

And then—something brushed against my legs.

Not a hand. Not fur. Just a presence. Like a current of air that was too thick, too intentional, passing under the desk and around my knees.

I gripped the desk so tight my knuckles cracked.

And though I hadn’t broken any rule—not this time—I whispered anyway:

“I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.”

Because in this place? Hesitation might as well be guilt.

At 3:02 AM, the lights snapped back on. Just like that.

No sound. No whir. Just light.

But nothing was where it had been.

The air felt… different. Like it had shifted dimensions while I was trapped in the dark.

At 3:05 AM, I made a decision. I had to use the bathroom. My bladder didn’t care about ghosts.

I took the back hallway, keeping my eyes low, fast-walked in and out.

But on the way back—I passed the mirror by Room 108.

And like an idiot… I looked.

Rule 6: The mirror in the hallway by Room 108 will show things that aren’t there. Avoid looking at it after 3 AM.

In the reflection, I saw myself.

Standing perfectly still.

And behind me?

A man.

Tall. Unmoving. Face long and gray.

No eyes. Just smooth skin stretched over bone, like something unfinished. His mouth hung half open, as if he’d been caught mid-breath.

He was leaning over me. Hand raised. About to touch my shoulder.

I spun.

The hallway was empty.

But the mirror?

Still showed him.

Still reaching.

I ran—sprinted—back to the front desk, heart pounding like it was trying to crack my ribs from the inside.

And once again, I whispered the line.

“I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.”

Even though I knew it would.

At 3:59 AM, she came.

The woman in the green dress.

The one I had hoped wasn’t real.

She appeared in the front window without a sound—like she had risen straight from the ground. Her hair hung in wet ropes, soaked through. Her skin was too pale, pruned and water-logged, like she’d walked out of a lake that didn’t want her anymore.

And her eyes? Empty. Bulging. Too wide.

She stared directly through the glass. Didn’t blink. Didn’t move.

Just watched me.

And I knew—if I looked back too long, she’d find her way inside.

I dove under the desk, reached up with shaking fingers, and killed every light in the lobby.

Click. Click. Click.

Darkness again.

When I dared to look back toward the window—she was gone.

But she hadn’t walked away.

She had vanished. Like steam. Or a memory.

And then… came the voice.

At 4:44 AM, it floated through the hallway like fog slipping through cracks in the foundation.

“Cody?”

A woman’s voice. Gentle. Familiar. My mother’s voice.

“Cody, sweetheart. Are you there?” Soft. Sweet. Desperate.

Every instinct in me screamed to answer. I nearly stood.

“Cody, it’s Mom. Please… I need help.”

But I didn’t speak. Didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.

I squeezed my eyes shut and clamped my hands over my ears.

I knew better.

Rule 9: At exactly 4:44 AM, you may hear someone whisper your name. Do not respond. Even if it sounds like your mother.

And it sounded exactly like her.

Too exact. Too perfect.

Like something wearing her voice as a mask.

I sat there for what felt like forever.

Until the voice faded.

Gone like fog under sunlight.

But it left something behind.

A feeling.

Like a hook still buried just under the skin.

Like the building wasn’t trying to scare me anymore—it was trying to learn me. Mimic me. Break me.

And I still had hours left before the sun would rise.

5:50 AM.

The clock ticked forward like it was crawling through molasses.

Ten minutes until sunrise.

I’d made it.

I’d followed every rule. Held my breath through every moment. Whispered the line more times than I could count.

For the first time all night, I started to relax.

That was my last mistake.

Because the elevator dinged.

Again.

The doors parted with a hiss, and out stepped a boy—no older than ten, dressed in soft blue pajamas, blinking like he’d just woken from a nap.

His hair was messy. His face round, unthreatening. Lost.

“Hey,” I called gently. “You okay?”

He nodded. His voice was small, polite. “Can you help me find my room?”

“Sure, what number is it?”

He smiled slightly. “One-oh-three.”

Everything inside me locked up. My legs rooted to the floor.

Rule 7: Never go into Room 103. It is always vacant. It must stay that way.

I took a step back, palms raised. “Sorry, kid. No one stays in that room.”

His face twitched. Confusion at first. Then something darker moved across it like a shadow crawling beneath his skin.

His eyes turned black. Not just dark—black, like ink spilled across a page.

His mouth stretched, too wide for his face, tearing at the corners.

And then—he whispered.

“You answered the phone.”

The lights died again.

Darkness fell like a hammer.

And the bell rang.

DING.

The sound sliced through the dark like a scream underwater.

I panicked—genuinely lost it. I didn’t whisper this time. I yelled it.

“I ACKNOWLEDGE MY MISTAKE! IT WON’T HAPPEN AGAIN!”

But the dark didn’t care.

Because this time… it wanted me to scream.

And then—

everything went black.

I woke up hours later, lying on the thin cot behind the desk.

Sunlight poured in through the windows.

Golden. Gentle. Unnatural in its calm.

Mr. Granger stood over me. Same stiff posture. Same cold blue eyes.

“You made it,” he said, like he was commenting on the weather.

My throat felt raw. My skin was ice.

I sat up slowly. “What the hell is this place?”

He didn’t answer the question.

He just handed me a check.

“You made it. That’s what matters.” He paused. Tilted his head. “Most don’t.”

That was all.

I didn’t ask anything else.

Didn’t want to know.

I stood. Walked out through the same doors he once disappeared through.

And I never—never—went back.

But sometimes…

Late at night… When everything’s quiet… When the wind stops and the house creaks and the phone charger hums—

I swear I hear it.

That baby crying.

Somewhere faint. Far away.

But getting closer.

And I don’t pick up the phone.

Hello! 

I (M40/Rhode Island) will be in Portland for ~4/5 weeks for harvest working for a winery in the city, and staying around the Grant Park / Hollywood neighborhood starting in about a week and half. What should I do in my free time? What are best experience to do in your city this time of year? I love meeting people, museums, botanical gardens, old city architecture, thrifting, a good spa, a good bakery/coffee shop/library to hang at with a book, biking, hiking, concerts, all types of food, staple dive bars to wine bars. Where do locals and food/bev/hospitality folks hang to blow off steam? Any really good markets, or interesting multiuse spaces or event venues? DJs and dance scenes that draw a good following to look for? What's the real deal lived Portland experience?

*I'm working on borrowing or buying a used bike to explore, but otherwise mostly in foot/public transit and without my own car. If you have any leads on a used bike shop or somewhere to shop for two wheels, feel free to share.

1ni6uxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ni6uxk/the_sky_that_isnt_ours_p1/,The Sky That Isn't Ours... P1,"The car pulled up on the driveway, gravel and debris crackling beneath the wheels as it did so. I opened the car door from where I was in the backseat and stumbled out, legs not ready to bear my weight after sitting for so long. I stare up at our rented house.

“What do you think, Quini?” My Nonna asks me from behind. It was an average house, not anything too appealing but alright.

“It’s alright I guess.” I reply, going to the back of our Subaru and opening the boot.

“Just alright eh, Joaquini?” My Nonno queries, chuckling softly.

“Yeah… Just alright.” I respond, sticking firmly to my original statement. I lug my bag out of the boot and start up the front of the house. Inside wasn’t any better, just the basics, kitchen, living-room, bathrooms, and bedrooms, nothing special. While my Nonno and Nonna looked around and inspected the rooms, muttering

“They could have done a better job with the paintwork” and

“They should have put wood tiles here or at least polished concrete” and something to that effect, I unpacked in the room that my grandparents gestured at when arranging bedrooms. It was dark so I just turned the light on. I moved and arranged stuff to my liking, and then looked out the window… The thing was… There was no window, just a wall painted over where a window should have been, that’s why it was so dark. 

“Hey, erm, aren’t there meant to be windows in my room?” I bellowed down the hall. The only response were 2 sets of feet marching to my room to inspect it. When my grandparents reached my room, they stood in the doorway and my Nonno was suddenly stern and annoyed.

“Joaquin, there’s a window right there.” Nonno said and pointed to the wall. I looked and there really was a window, a slightly grimy glass panel sat there. But it was wrong… It was like it wasn’t meant to be there, it looked like it was slapped in the last second, crooked. Sunlight streamed through and dust billowed in the light. 

“Oh, I must have missed it…” I say, a bit confused, knowing I couldn’t have possibly missed the window. Now, this is the part where you might think this is a lame story, but trust me, this isn’t a story written by some 7 year-old where windows disappear and reappear. God, I wish it was, because what truly was happening was something way more terrifying. I tried to find a reasonable explanation, maybe a curtain was covering the window and was swept away by a breeze just as my grandparents entered, but of course I didn’t believe it, I knew something funny was happening. Number 1, because I checked the wall thoroughly, not a swift sloppy glance at the window place, but a thorough gaze. Number 2, there were no curtains! I was a little worried for myself, no one just misses a window like that unless they have problems with their brain! And I was always paranoid about myself getting brain problems… My Nonno and Nonna exchanged concerned and worried glances and just kind of stayed there supervising my window gazing, still sharing concerned glances, and muttering under their breath. I saw a group of kids around my age through the window, some running, some riding bikes, passing through the street. And then suddenly, one stopped, and stared straight at me, through the window. A bolt of unease shot down my spine, something weird was definitely happening around here. Nonna saw them, but I don’t think she saw the one staring straight at me though. She turned to me and said:

“Why don’t you go play with those kids, you’ll want some friends to play with for the 2 weeks holiday.” 

I shrugged, I was a bit hesitant. Was I relieved to escape the house and my grandparents, or a bit scared to be walking straight for the group where that kid was staring at me? I don’t know. I ended up heading down the drive to introduce myself to the kids. I was definitely a bit more than concerned about my own behaviour, I’ll admit that… Maybe it was sleep deprivation and my sleepy mind was playing tricks on me? I had woken up early for the day-long car trip here and I didn’t get any sleep on the ride, perhaps my brain was just playing some tricks. I walked towards the group and when I came up to them, they paused and looked at me. 

“Erm, hi, i’m Joaquin and er…” I break off, a bit nervous and not knowing what to say. The kids look at me and then to others in the group. A boy who was probably around 15 or 16 with short curly blonde hair looked up from the phone he was holding and stated matter-of-factly:

“Seems like a new kid in the neighborhood.” And then all the kids threw up their hands in a slight applause, chattering amongst themselves loudly. I heard one, a girl, who had glossy straight hair, pretty eyes and looked around 12 or 13, say:

“Finally, it’s been boring around here.” When the slight applause died down, a boy in the group said to a girl:

“Give him your bike, Eloise, let him ride it.” Eloise, who was indeed on a bike, looked a bit reluctant but handed me the bike. 

“Er, thanks.” I mutter. With that, they introduced themselves. The girl who made the comment about ‘it’s been boring around here’ was named Hannah, and Mitch, the one that was on the phone, was her older brother and was 16, reluctantly tagging along with his sister’s younger friends. Erica was another in the group, a lanky 14 year old girl with curly long black hair. She was shy but very nice and polite. Eloise, the one who gave me the bike, was a 9 year old girl, and I found her really weird. She whispered to me:

“Don’t go through the windows… The sky behind them isn't ours…” And despite how quiet she was, the rest of the group gave her disapproving looks and said something along the lines of 'Don't tell him any of that crap just yet, don’t want to scare the new kid away, do we?’. I found this behaviour very odd but I said nothing, leaving the thoughts swirling through the abyss of my cranium. Something really damn strange was happening around here, something strange about the windows… Perhaps, some dark secrets the rest of the group were in on that I wasn’t…There were a bunch more kids, some younger than me, some older but I couldn’t have possibly remembered all their names just yet… Though I remember the names, Charlie, Peter, and Jake but don’t remember who those names belonged to. A dog emerged from the brush on the side of the street and ran up to Mitch, panting madly. Mitch dropped to his knees, shoving his phone into his pocket and patted the dog, praising it as he did so. This must have been Mitch’s and Hannah’s dog. 

“So, do the rest of you have any pets?” I ask lamely, in hopes of starting a conversation. A few nod their heads. 

“I used to… It was just a little kitten.” Erica says, dreamily.

“Er, what happened?” I ask, curious and a little uncomfortable. After an awkward silence, she responded,

“It decided to go through the windows one day, the silly little thing… The windows, something’s wrong with them…” Immediately after she says this, I feel a knot of dread in my stomach. I felt that something really bad was going to happen, some animalistic primitive instinct.

“What!?” I asked, a little too loud and Erica put a hand to her lips even though the whole group was listening anyway.

“Are yours wrong too?” She asked.

“Yes… They are, what’s going on? Do you know what’s wrong with them?” I asked, pushing the words out of my mouth at mach 5 in a desperate attempt to gain insight. 

“No, we don’t know what’s wrong with them, but the sky through them… it isn’t ours… Goodbye for now, see ya tomorrow.” And with that she strolled away, waving while the rest shouted ‘goodbyes’. As I walked back up the driveway, I thought about the group’s odd behaviour and the phrase they’ve been repeating to me, ‘The sky that isn’t ours’ or something like that. A chill ran down my spine just thinking about that creepy phrase. I take my shoes off slowly, and pause as I am about to enter the house. I take a deep breath and stroll in, plastering a neutral expression on my face. 

“Ah, Quini, I was just about to come looking for you, we got some Domino Pizza.” My Nonna tells me, her voice coming from the living room. I go into the living room and act normal, eating pizza, though I didn’t have much of an appetite, answering questions normally, and just acting normal over all. We turn on the TV and watch a news program, a gardening program, and then a quiz program. After a while, my grandparents say it’s time for bed so I shower and brush my teeth and jump into bed. I look over at the window, and for a split second I think I see the faint silhouettes of the group of kids, standing in the streets looking through my window, and then I slowly fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos… I’m standing in a dark hallway, there are locked doors on both sides, grass growing from the small spaces between the door and the floor. I do not know how I got here. I walk to the end of the hallway and there is a boarded up window, light seeping in through the cracks. I grab the edge of one of the boards and pull. The board comes away in my hand, the nails providing no resistance. Sunlight gushes in and I am temporarily blinded. I look out the window and a surreal scene meets my gaze… Grass, stretching out endlessly and I can’t see anything else in the distance, no buildings or anything, just grass and a bright cloudless blue sky. Nostalgia washes over me, I don’t know why it was nostalgic to me but it was, like a liminal space… Dread starts to build up in me, the space seems frozen in time, so isolated and unknown. And for just a fraction of a second, I swear I see a white figure way in the distance before the image fades away and I wake up, gasping for air, pillow and blanket wet with sweat. It was all just a dream and now I am awake and it’s morning. I hear the sound of a coffee machine in the kitchen, this tells me that Nonno and Nonna are up. I get up, shaky on my knees and exit my room, stumbling into the kitchen.

“Good morning, Joaquin.” Nonno says, clapping his hand on my shoulder.

“Get a good sleep?” He asks.

“Yeah…” I lie. 

“I had a weird dream…” I then explained to him what happened in the dream, Nonna coming into the kitchen in the middle of my explanation of the dream. Nonno and Nonna nod at all the right places, exchanging a ‘that's interesting’ and a ‘weird indeed’ every now and then. I finish telling them what happened in my dream and grabbed myself a bowl and poured oats into it. I sit down in the living room and eat slowly, thinking about the strange events that have happened lately. I finish my oats and place the bowl in the sink, filling it up with water. 

“Hey Nonna, are we doing anything today?” I ask as I pass her by the coffee machine.

“Were going to go to the beach later, maybe in an hour or 2.” Nonna responds, tampering with the coffee machine.

“Alright, mind if I go for a walk?” 

“Just make sure to come back soon, Quini.” She responds.

“Alright then, see ya.” I say to her and then I walk out the house as she says ‘bye Quini’. Nonno is in the Subaru, talking on the phone, a business call I assume. I wave at him as I walk down the driveway and he waves back. I reach the end of the drive and step onto the street. I walk down the street, the air crisp and cool, great trees casting shade over me, serving as guardians from the… Sky… The sky that isn’t ours… I reached a part of the street where all the houses were new or had just been built not too long ago. I noticed something off immediately. The place where windows should have been were boarded up!“What the hell!” I practically shout to myself. 

“What the hell indeed…” A voice says from behind me. I whirl around. It was a red-haired boy. Charlie, or was it Jake? Nah it was Peter… I think. And behind him was Erica, Hannah, Mitch, and Eloise. The group was much smaller today. 

“The boarded up windows… Indeed weird, what the hell for sure.” Erica says.

“You know, boarded windows ain’t about keeping people out. Sometimes it’s what’s on the other side that needs keeping in.” A voice of an old man says, coming from behind us. We all turn around and I see an old man standing there. Recognition clicked in the eyes of the group, except for me though.

“Good morning Mr. Keating.” My group says in unison. 

“Good morning kids.” He responds and then looks towards me. “I don’t think I've seen you before…” The man says, matter-of-factly.

“That’s the new kid, Joaquin, Mr. Keating.” The red-haired boy says to the man. 

“Well that makes sense… Heed my warning young man.” And with that the man strolls away. That man was… Wrong… It felt like he wasn’t meant to exist and I realised that what he said didn’t make sense, we hadn’t said anything about the boards keeping people out, so why did he mention it out of the blue? It was as if the man knew we would sneak in out of curiosity.

“Who was that man?” I ask immediately once the man is out of earshot.

“Mr. Keating, the old handyman.” Hannah replies.

“He was creepy, I didn’t even hear him sneak up on us.” I say.

“We got used to it, man.” Mitch responds.

“What was that he said? Something about keeping something in-” I start and Eloise cuts me off-

”boarded windows ain’t about keeping people out. Sometimes it’s what’s on the other side that needs keeping in.” She recites with ease in a monotone voice, as if she was reading off somewhere. That’s when I snapped, I couldn’t bloody handle the weirdness any longer!

“You know… I’m sick of this! What the hell is going around here? There is something weird going on and you guys know it! What is this, some sort of prank?” I ask, raising my voice. They just stood there, looking at me and then to the houses.

“No, not a prank, this is real alright.” Eloise speaks up, softly and dreamily before the words spew out of my mouth immediately after she finishes speaking.

“I’m going to the beach later today. So that’s why tomorrow, we're going to sneak into one of those houses with the boarded up windows and pry the boards off! And then we’ll go through the windows and into the sky that isn’t ours!” 

“I really don’t think that’s a good ide-” Eloise starts but I cut her off-

“Tomorrow at noon, we’re prying those boards off. I don’t care what’s behind them, I need to see it. Bring the whole group.”

Eloise’s face went pale, but I turned and stormed off before she could say anything else. We go to the beach and I bodysurf waves. 

“The waves are nasty here.” Nonna says. 

“They slam down on you and pummel you into the sand if you're not careful.” She adds in.

I catch them just fine, I don’t even get slammed into the sand. I think about everything, the weird disappearing and reappearing window in my room, the group of kids, the weird dream, the strange handyman, and the houses with boarded up windows. I think about our plan to break into one of the houses at noon. Just thinking about this sends chills running smack down my spine, the sky that isn’t ours… Well, we’re going to be there soon… The endless liminal grassland awaits us. We stop at a restaurant on the way back from the beach, we eat and then leave again. And then to my great annoyance, we stopped at a jazz club. The music there seems warped and distorted, and they played a sad slow ambient piece that filled me with dread. We stayed there so long it was already night when we were heading back home. I jump into bed back at home, Nonna doesn't know I forgot to have a shower and brush my teeth, ah well… I look out the window and I see a flicker of the liminal grassland, the grass stretching out endlessly, and the white figure is in the distance, waiting for me. And then I fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos… I don’t even know where I got that phrase from… Glass bridge suspended in the cosmos… Weird… In the morning I awakened from my dreamless slumber. I open my heavy eyelids and just kind of lay there, staring at the plain roof. I listened for the sounds of cutlery clanking, the coffee machine buzzing but I didn’t hear any of those. In fact, I hear nothing, just a deafening silence… I slowly get out of bed and walk out of my room, looking behind me as I did so. I saw the liminal grassland through the window. In a fit of rage and confusion, I sprint to the window and raise my fists, and then slam them hard into-

“Ah, shit!” I yelp as my fists connect with a solid wall, completely devoid of any windows. I was boiling with frustration, and my hands were boiling with pain, red and raw. I just stood there, standing in front of the wall, seething with hatred. I walk away and into the kitchen.

“Nonna? Nonno?” I called out, but the only response was the dull silence. I reached the conclusion that they must still be sleeping, but I then spotted a lined piece of paper that had seemed to be lazily ripped out of a notebook with scrawled cursive handwriting. It read:

*To Joaqyuin*

*Me and Nonno have gone shopping at a mall nearby,* 

*We will be back soon, call us if you need anything.*

*XOXO Nonna*

After reading the note, I flip it over, grab a pen, and then hastily wrote:

*Gone out to play*

Then I scrambled out the front door, and down the drive. I reached the part of the street where the houses had all their windows boarded up. ‘Crap’, I thought, I didn't even check the time, I might have been too early and would have had to spend an annoyingly long time waiting for the rest of the group. I waited on the side of the street for a while. It felt like forever to me, and just when I decided I didn’t need company to see what was behind the windows, I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up, and saw the whole group, fully complete except for Eloise, the little wuss. They stopped when I saw them and  just stood there, staring at me. After an awkward moment of silence, Erica approached me and put a hand on my shoulder. 

“We’re ready, but you know…” She took a deep breath

“We don’t have to do this.” I looked up at her, staring straight at her eyes and said:

“Yes we do! I am sick of all of this, the boarded up windows, the sky that isn’t ours, and that weird creepy liminal grasslands that I keep seeing! Don’t you guys want to know what’s behind all of this? I am sick of it, today, we will find out the truth for ourselves!” They all nodded at me and saluted a salute I would have laughed at in any other situation. I get up quickly, and then head for the closest house while the rest follow me. I reach a boarded up window, and while fuming with rage, frustration, and confusion, I punch through the fucking boards, splinters dug into my knuckles but I don’t care and keep going. I shred the boards and they fall away, hitting the ground with a dull thud. I look through and see what I know I will see… The grassland, stretching out endlessly, nothing visible in the distance except for just grass, grass that probably went on forever. The sky is blue, stretched over the endless-flat landscape, no visible sun but somehow it’s still really bright. I see the white figure in the distance and emotions threaten to explode inside me.

“Oh, this ends NOW!!!” I shout, backing away from the window before sprinting at it as fast as my legs would carry me. I dive through the fucking window...",1,1757993554.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

My question is, what will help make this living room look bigger. 

We’re thinking sectional on the wall with the window and the door and the back wall, coffee table in front of the couch, entertainment stand against the other wall and mounted TV + maybe a nice lamp or blanket ladder near the patio door. I’m attaching the dimensions of the apartment as well as pictures from the virtual tour furnished and unfurnished as well - any help would be amazing :) we’re really struggling right now. 

Also suggestions on couch sizes, types, examples or anything else that can help make it look bigger would be super appreciated!

1ni6ult,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ni6ult/do_time_machines_exist/,Do time machines exist?,"Throwaway account because I prefer to suffer quietly. 

I find myself almost exclusively living in my memory. So much so that I have a delusional fantasy that if I focus as hard as I can, I can travel back in time.

My memory is almost like a library now. I spend my days there going up and down the isles, selecting a memory at random, and let that memory wash over me. Next thing I know, an hour, day, month has passed and the world kept moving while I have been living in a world that hasn’t existed in years. 

Last week it was a four leaf clover I found. I never paid attention to them much before losing my husband. But I was in my yard and spotted one. And the rest of the day I recounted over the over how much my husband loved them. He would find them in our yard and use scotch tape to preserve them. It was a sweet and thoughtful gesture at the time. Now it is everything to me. These things mattered so much more than I ever realized. I would give anything to find a scotch taped clover on the kitchen counter again. 

Food tasted better. Colors were more vivid. I thought everything was silly. I laughed at TV shows. Music sounded better. Books were more interesting. Things were more beautiful. Sunsets were more red. Clouds were more puffy. Bird chirped louder and crickets sang more beautifully.  

My husband loved coffee and I loved waking up and finding a fresh pot waiting for me that he had made when he left for work hours earlier. Today, the same machine, same beans, same water, but it tastes like paint thinner. 

Everyone says to try and remember and move on. But if I move on, what if I forget? Sometimes, when you live almost exclusively in memories like I do, it’s almost like a dream that is fleeting when you first wake up. The harder you try and remember, the more is evaporates. What do I do?

Here’s a little about me: I don’t have a lot of time for social stuff; I work all the time. I have friends, I do stuff, but I’m always working when my friends are free. They are married and have kids—thrilled for them, but so vastly different from my own life; hence why I am here.

I enjoy reading—fiction, autobiographies, but mainly fiction; sleeping in on weekends; watching Netflix; exploring cafes; drinking iced coffee; and singing loudly to my music.

I am a night owl, and that probably won’t change. It's normal for me to drink Coca-Cola with lots of ice and listen to audiobooks or watch a series or a movie.

1ni6sy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ni6sy6/the_sky_that_isnt_ours_p1/,The Sky That Isn't Ours... P1,"The car pulled up on the driveway, gravel and debris crackling beneath the wheels as it did so. I opened the car door from where I was in the backseat and stumbled out, legs not ready to bear my weight after sitting for so long. I stare up at our rented house.

“What do you think, Quini?” My Nonna asks me from behind. It was an average house, not anything too appealing but alright.

“It’s alright I guess.” I reply, going to the back of our Subaru and opening the boot.

“Just alright eh, Joaquini?” My Nonno queries, chuckling softly.

“Yeah… Just alright.” I respond, sticking firmly to my original statement. I lug my bag out of the boot and start up the front of the house. Inside wasn’t any better, just the basics, kitchen, living-room, bathrooms, and bedrooms, nothing special. While my Nonno and Nonna looked around and inspected the rooms, muttering

“They could have done a better job with the paintwork” and

“They should have put wood tiles here or at least polished concrete” and something to that effect, I unpacked in the room that my grandparents gestured at when arranging bedrooms. It was dark so I just turned the light on. I moved and arranged stuff to my liking, and then looked out the window… The thing was… There was no window, just a wall painted over where a window should have been, that’s why it was so dark. 

“Hey, erm, aren’t there meant to be windows in my room?” I bellowed down the hall. The only response were 2 sets of feet marching to my room to inspect it. When my grandparents reached my room, they stood in the doorway and my Nonno was suddenly stern and annoyed.

“Joaquin, there’s a window right there.” Nonno said and pointed to the wall. I looked and there really was a window, a slightly grimy glass panel sat there. But it was wrong… It was like it wasn’t meant to be there, it looked like it was slapped in the last second, crooked. Sunlight streamed through and dust billowed in the light. 

“Oh, I must have missed it…” I say, a bit confused, knowing I couldn’t have possibly missed the window. Now, this is the part where you might think this is a lame story, but trust me, this isn’t a story written by some 7 year-old where windows disappear and reappear. God, I wish it was, because what truly was happening was something way more terrifying. I tried to find a reasonable explanation, maybe a curtain was covering the window and was swept away by a breeze just as my grandparents entered, but of course I didn’t believe it, I knew something funny was happening. Number 1, because I checked the wall thoroughly, not a swift sloppy glance at the window place, but a thorough gaze. Number 2, there were no curtains! I was a little worried for myself, no one just misses a window like that unless they have problems with their brain! And I was always paranoid about myself getting brain problems… My Nonno and Nonna exchanged concerned and worried glances and just kind of stayed there supervising my window gazing, still sharing concerned glances, and muttering under their breath. I saw a group of kids around my age through the window, some running, some riding bikes, passing through the street. And then suddenly, one stopped, and stared straight at me, through the window. A bolt of unease shot down my spine, something weird was definitely happening around here. Nonna saw them, but I don’t think she saw the one staring straight at me though. She turned to me and said:

“Why don’t you go play with those kids, you’ll want some friends to play with for the 2 weeks holiday.” 

I shrugged, I was a bit hesitant. Was I relieved to escape the house and my grandparents, or a bit scared to be walking straight for the group where that kid was staring at me? I don’t know. I ended up heading down the drive to introduce myself to the kids. I was definitely a bit more than concerned about my own behaviour, I’ll admit that… Maybe it was sleep deprivation and my sleepy mind was playing tricks on me? I had woken up early for the day-long car trip here and I didn’t get any sleep on the ride, perhaps my brain was just playing some tricks. I walked towards the group and when I came up to them, they paused and looked at me. 

“Erm, hi, i’m Joaquin and er…” I break off, a bit nervous and not knowing what to say. The kids look at me and then to others in the group. A boy who was probably around 15 or 16 with short curly blonde hair looked up from the phone he was holding and stated matter-of-factly:

“Seems like a new kid in the neighborhood.” And then all the kids threw up their hands in a slight applause, chattering amongst themselves loudly. I heard one, a girl, who had glossy straight hair, pretty eyes and looked around 12 or 13, say:

“Finally, it’s been boring around here.” When the slight applause died down, a boy in the group said to a girl:

“Give him your bike, Eloise, let him ride it.” Eloise, who was indeed on a bike, looked a bit reluctant but handed me the bike. 

“Er, thanks.” I mutter. With that, they introduced themselves. The girl who made the comment about ‘it’s been boring around here’ was named Hannah, and Mitch, the one that was on the phone, was her older brother and was 16, reluctantly tagging along with his sister’s younger friends. Erica was another in the group, a lanky 14 year old girl with curly long black hair. She was shy but very nice and polite. Eloise, the one who gave me the bike, was a 9 year old girl, and I found her really weird. She whispered to me:

“Don’t go through the windows… The sky behind them isn't ours…” And despite how quiet she was, the rest of the group gave her disapproving looks and said something along the lines of 'Don't tell him any of that crap just yet, don’t want to scare the new kid away, do we?’. I found this behaviour very odd but I said nothing, leaving the thoughts swirling through the abyss of my cranium. Something really damn strange was happening around here, something strange about the windows… Perhaps, some dark secrets the rest of the group were in on that I wasn’t…There were a bunch more kids, some younger than me, some older but I couldn’t have possibly remembered all their names just yet… Though I remember the names, Charlie, Peter, and Jake but don’t remember who those names belonged to. A dog emerged from the brush on the side of the street and ran up to Mitch, panting madly. Mitch dropped to his knees, shoving his phone into his pocket and patted the dog, praising it as he did so. This must have been Mitch’s and Hannah’s dog. 

“So, do the rest of you have any pets?” I ask lamely, in hopes of starting a conversation. A few nod their heads. 

“I used to… It was just a little kitten.” Erica says, dreamily.

“Er, what happened?” I ask, curious and a little uncomfortable. After an awkward silence, she responded,

“It decided to go through the windows one day, the silly little thing… The windows, something’s wrong with them…” Immediately after she says this, I feel a knot of dread in my stomach. I felt that something really bad was going to happen, some animalistic primitive instinct.

“What!?” I asked, a little too loud and Erica put a hand to her lips even though the whole group was listening anyway.

“Are yours wrong too?” She asked.

“Yes… They are, what’s going on? Do you know what’s wrong with them?” I asked, pushing the words out of my mouth at mach 5 in a desperate attempt to gain insight. 

“No, we don’t know what’s wrong with them, but the sky through them… it isn’t ours… Goodbye for now, see ya tomorrow.” And with that she strolled away, waving while the rest shouted ‘goodbyes’. As I walked back up the driveway, I thought about the group’s odd behaviour and the phrase they’ve been repeating to me, ‘The sky that isn’t ours’ or something like that. A chill ran down my spine just thinking about that creepy phrase. I take my shoes off slowly, and pause as I am about to enter the house. I take a deep breath and stroll in, plastering a neutral expression on my face. 

“Ah, Quini, I was just about to come looking for you, we got some Domino Pizza.” My Nonna tells me, her voice coming from the living room. I go into the living room and act normal, eating pizza, though I didn’t have much of an appetite, answering questions normally, and just acting normal over all. We turn on the TV and watch a news program, a gardening program, and then a quiz program. After a while, my grandparents say it’s time for bed so I shower and brush my teeth and jump into bed. I look over at the window, and for a split second I think I see the faint silhouettes of the group of kids, standing in the streets looking through my window, and then I slowly fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos… I’m standing in a dark hallway, there are locked doors on both sides, grass growing from the small spaces between the door and the floor. I do not know how I got here. I walk to the end of the hallway and there is a boarded up window, light seeping in through the cracks. I grab the edge of one of the boards and pull. The board comes away in my hand, the nails providing no resistance. Sunlight gushes in and I am temporarily blinded. I look out the window and a surreal scene meets my gaze… Grass, stretching out endlessly and I can’t see anything else in the distance, no buildings or anything, just grass and a bright cloudless blue sky. Nostalgia washes over me, I don’t know why it was nostalgic to me but it was, like a liminal space… Dread starts to build up in me, the space seems frozen in time, so isolated and unknown. And for just a fraction of a second, I swear I see a white figure way in the distance before the image fades away and I wake up, gasping for air, pillow and blanket wet with sweat. It was all just a dream and now I am awake and it’s morning. I hear the sound of a coffee machine in the kitchen, this tells me that Nonno and Nonna are up. I get up, shaky on my knees and exit my room, stumbling into the kitchen.

“Good morning, Joaquin.” Nonno says, clapping his hand on my shoulder.

“Get a good sleep?” He asks.

“Yeah…” I lie. 

“I had a weird dream…” I then explained to him what happened in the dream, Nonna coming into the kitchen in the middle of my explanation of the dream. Nonno and Nonna nod at all the right places, exchanging a ‘that's interesting’ and a ‘weird indeed’ every now and then. I finish telling them what happened in my dream and grabbed myself a bowl and poured oats into it. I sit down in the living room and eat slowly, thinking about the strange events that have happened lately. I finish my oats and place the bowl in the sink, filling it up with water. 

“Hey Nonna, are we doing anything today?” I ask as I pass her by the coffee machine.

“Were going to go to the beach later, maybe in an hour or 2.” Nonna responds, tampering with the coffee machine.

“Alright, mind if I go for a walk?” 

“Just make sure to come back soon, Quini.” She responds.

“Alright then, see ya.” I say to her and then I walk out the house as she says ‘bye Quini’. Nonno is in the Subaru, talking on the phone, a business call I assume. I wave at him as I walk down the driveway and he waves back. I reach the end of the drive and step onto the street. I walk down the street, the air crisp and cool, great trees casting shade over me, serving as guardians from the… Sky… The sky that isn’t ours… I reached a part of the street where all the houses were new or had just been built not too long ago. I noticed something off immediately. The place where windows should have been were boarded up!“What the hell!” I practically shout to myself. 

“What the hell indeed…” A voice says from behind me. I whirl around. It was a red-haired boy. Charlie, or was it Jake? Nah it was Peter… I think. And behind him was Erica, Hannah, Mitch, and Eloise. The group was much smaller today. 

“The boarded up windows… Indeed weird, what the hell for sure.” Erica says.

“You know, boarded windows ain’t about keeping people out. Sometimes it’s what’s on the other side that needs keeping in.” A voice of an old man says, coming from behind us. We all turn around and I see an old man standing there. Recognition clicked in the eyes of the group, except for me though.

“Good morning Mr. Keating.” My group says in unison. 

“Good morning kids.” He responds and then looks towards me. “I don’t think I've seen you before…” The man says, matter-of-factly.

“That’s the new kid, Joaquin, Mr. Keating.” The red-haired boy says to the man. 

“Well that makes sense… Heed my warning young man.” And with that the man strolls away. That man was… Wrong… It felt like he wasn’t meant to exist and I realised that what he said didn’t make sense, we hadn’t said anything about the boards keeping people out, so why did he mention it out of the blue? It was as if the man knew we would sneak in out of curiosity.

“Who was that man?” I ask immediately once the man is out of earshot.

“Mr. Keating, the old handyman.” Hannah replies.

“He was creepy, I didn’t even hear him sneak up on us.” I say.

“We got used to it, man.” Mitch responds.

“What was that he said? Something about keeping something in-” I start and Eloise cuts me off-

”boarded windows ain’t about keeping people out. Sometimes it’s what’s on the other side that needs keeping in.” She recites with ease in a monotone voice, as if she was reading off somewhere. That’s when I snapped, I couldn’t bloody handle the weirdness any longer!

“You know… I’m sick of this! What the hell is going around here? There is something weird going on and you guys know it! What is this, some sort of prank?” I ask, raising my voice. They just stood there, looking at me and then to the houses.

“No, not a prank, this is real alright.” Eloise speaks up, softly and dreamily before the words spew out of my mouth immediately after she finishes speaking.

“I’m going to the beach later today. So that’s why tomorrow, we're going to sneak into one of those houses with the boarded up windows and pry the boards off! And then we’ll go through the windows and into the sky that isn’t ours!” 

“I really don’t think that’s a good ide-” Eloise starts but I cut her off-

“Tomorrow at noon, we’re prying those boards off. I don’t care what’s behind them, I need to see it. Bring the whole group.”

Eloise’s face went pale, but I turned and stormed off before she could say anything else. We go to the beach and I bodysurf waves. 

“The waves are nasty here.” Nonna says. 

“They slam down on you and pummel you into the sand if you're not careful.” She adds in.

I catch them just fine, I don’t even get slammed into the sand. I think about everything, the weird disappearing and reappearing window in my room, the group of kids, the weird dream, the strange handyman, and the houses with boarded up windows. I think about our plan to break into one of the houses at noon. Just thinking about this sends chills running smack down my spine, the sky that isn’t ours… Well, we’re going to be there soon… The endless liminal grassland awaits us. We stop at a restaurant on the way back from the beach, we eat and then leave again. And then to my great annoyance, we stopped at a jazz club. The music there seems warped and distorted, and they played a sad slow ambient piece that filled me with dread. We stayed there so long it was already night when we were heading back home. I jump into bed back at home, Nonna doesn't know I forgot to have a shower and brush my teeth, ah well… I look out the window and I see a flicker of the liminal grassland, the grass stretching out endlessly, and the white figure is in the distance, waiting for me. And then I fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos… I don’t even know where I got that phrase from… Glass bridge suspended in the cosmos… Weird… In the morning I awakened from my dreamless slumber. I open my heavy eyelids and just kind of lay there, staring at the plain roof. I listened for the sounds of cutlery clanking, the coffee machine buzzing but I didn’t hear any of those. In fact, I hear nothing, just a deafening silence… I slowly get out of bed and walk out of my room, looking behind me as I did so. I saw the liminal grassland through the window. In a fit of rage and confusion, I sprint to the window and raise my fists, and then slam them hard into-

“Ah, shit!” I yelp as my fists connect with a solid wall, completely devoid of any windows. I was boiling with frustration, and my hands were boiling with pain, red and raw. I just stood there, standing in front of the wall, seething with hatred. I walk away and into the kitchen.

“Nonna? Nonno?” I called out, but the only response was the dull silence. I reached the conclusion that they must still be sleeping, but I then spotted a lined piece of paper that had seemed to be lazily ripped out of a notebook with scrawled cursive handwriting. It read:

*To Joaqyuin*

*Me and Nonno have gone shopping at a mall nearby,* 

*We will be back soon, call us if you need anything.*

*XOXO Nonna*

After reading the note, I flip it over, grab a pen, and then hastily wrote:

*Gone out to play*

Then I scrambled out the front door, and down the drive. I reached the part of the street where the houses had all their windows boarded up. ‘Crap’, I thought, I didn't even check the time, I might have been too early and would have had to spend an annoyingly long time waiting for the rest of the group. I waited on the side of the street for a while. It felt like forever to me, and just when I decided I didn’t need company to see what was behind the windows, I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up, and saw the whole group, fully complete except for Eloise, the little wuss. They stopped when I saw them and  just stood there, staring at me. After an awkward moment of silence, Erica approached me and put a hand on my shoulder. 

“We’re ready, but you know…” She took a deep breath

“We don’t have to do this.” I looked up at her, staring straight at her eyes and said:

“Yes we do! I am sick of all of this, the boarded up windows, the sky that isn’t ours, and that weird creepy liminal grasslands that I keep seeing! Don’t you guys want to know what’s behind all of this? I am sick of it, today, we will find out the truth for ourselves!” They all nodded at me and saluted a salute I would have laughed at in any other situation. I get up quickly, and then head for the closest house while the rest follow me. I reach a boarded up window, and while fuming with rage, frustration, and confusion, I punch through the fucking boards, splinters dug into my knuckles but I don’t care and keep going. I shred the boards and they fall away, hitting the ground with a dull thud. I look through and see what I know I will see… The grassland, stretching out endlessly, nothing visible in the distance except for just grass, grass that probably went on forever. The sky is blue, stretched over the endless-flat landscape, no visible sun but somehow it’s still really bright. I see the white figure in the distance and emotions threaten to explode inside me.

“Oh, this ends NOW!!!” I shout, backing away from the window before sprinting at it as fast as my legs would carry me. I dive through the fucking window...

Like I’d sit down, make a nice looking spreadsheet, feel good about myself for a week, and then completely ignore it. End of the month would hit and I’d be like $250–$300 over without even realizing it. It was always the “little stuff” too like random coffee runs, late night takeout, dumb Target impulse buys. Nothing huge, just constant leaks.

What finally saved me was autopay + forcing myself onto a system I couldn’t cheat. I set rent, utilities, internet to autopay right after my paycheck hits, so that’s gone before I can even think about spending it. Then I switched to a debit card that reports to the credit bureaus for daily stuff like groceries and gas. That way I can’t spend more than what’s in my account, but it’s still building credit in the background. Honestly feels like training wheels but it works for me.

I’ve been doing this about 8 months now and my credit score went up around 50 points.

But when you were here, we accidentally created one of the most mesmerizing, beautiful, rarest emotional ecosystems that ever flourished. We never became more. We didn’t even know we had it like that because you and I were so determined not to cross professional boundaries at all cost. 

And yet, we understood each other without many words, without touch. With you, I experienced one of the most profound feelings and witnessed you - how you move through the world… I genuinely didn’t know that such an amazing person could exist. 

I once wrote that I would talk to you for hours if I could. I take it back. I wouldn’t waste those hours talking. I would brew us the best coffee an ex-barista can do and slurp it under the stars in sweet glorious silence. 

Besides, you truly couldn’t stand when I went on seemingly unnecessary tangents, or maybe you secretly loved it. I don’t know. You once mirrored the sentiment “no judgment here” 

The memory of your expression and the look in your eyes is fading. All but one lone photo.

1ni6rgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ni6rgr/im_utterly_distraught_please_give_me_your/,"I'm utterly distraught, please give me your thoughts on this","tldr; i just don’t understand how she could just move on from me within the span of 1 month, i loved her religiously but the crazy thing is that she actually loved me more, she was the one who initiated the relationship, she was the one who searched for my socials for 3 days to reach out to me, she was the one who wrote a love confession, she was the one who was ""all in"" from day 1. so then, how can she just replace me with someone else within a month?! that easily...? like I'm nothing to her now..











context:
let me summarize the relationship, im 23, she's 21 it was my first time ever falling in love, her first time as well, i work as dental supervisor in college dentistry department (basically my job is to make sure dental students don't fuck up something when operating on patients) she came one day as a patient and the student operating on her was fucking something up, i came to help and solve the problem, it was her first appointment out of 4) from that moment, since day 1, i immediately felt a connection between us, chalk it up to intuition, 3 days later she follows me on insta and dms me about her dental concerns.


you need to understand, i don't have my own face on my insta profile, nor do i even have my name there, there's absolutely no shot she randomly knew that was my account, i didn't pay it much attention at first, she had that ""sweet, innocent, outgoing, way too friendly for her own good"" kinda vibe to her so i kept on gaslighting myself into thinking she's just innocently reaching out about her condition. in retrospect, i missed too many signs at first. so anyways, it's been over 2 weeks of us chatting almost daily, she'd always throw hints and stuff, until one day she randomly tells me that she had a present for me, so we set up a meeting at the clinic door (she's a student at the same college but differently department) i took that opportunity to ask her out for some coffee, we chatted for a bit, i FOR SOME REASON told her about my biggest fear in life that being dying alone, she seemed to be taken aback by that, but like in a good way.



later that day, she posts a story, 3 pics, on of us taken infront of a mirror in the coffee shop (without my consent) another of a bouquet of flowers, and another with the drinks we got, with the caption ""made my day"" it was then that i knew she wasn't just friendly, she's actively into me


a few days later, it was a cold night, around 2 am, we were chatting about random stuff and i yold her about how I'm moving to the uae next year to work there after my contract ends with my current job, she seemed really bummed out about it, replied with ""without me..?"" then i took that chance to finally confess my feelings, she was over the moon with joy, told me how she was gonna confess first if i didn't, she even prepared a confession letter and everything, also told me how joyous she was when i told her about my fear on the first date, that I'd trust her that much, we kept talking about all the hints thst we both shot and both missed, she even told me how much of a pain in the ass it was for her to find my socials.. it was a really special night...



then tragedy struck, the place we live in, iraq, the economy is so fucked and the traditions are so conservative that you literally can't do shut without your parents approval, you can't buy your own home, can't ask a woman's hand from her parents, can't get ahead in life without a good degree. and my parents ABSOLUTELY rejected her as a person, they hated her for her lower degree, her approach to the relationship, by her family's reputation, they outright completely refused her as a partner for me, my dad is both a surgeon and a famous poet and auther, my mom is one of the best doctors in her specific specialty, we are filthy rich, and both my parents are EXTREMELY narcissistic and full of themselves, i kept fighting for us to work for 2 months, zero progress, they outright told me they'd disown me if i refused their decision, and i know they meant it from prior experience.




this really broke my heart, and i relayed the bad news to my gf, she was really supportive and understanding at first, i promised her that I'll keep fighting for us, but after a while, my resolve wavered, i knew that for as long as i keep fighting, I'll just be prolonging the inevitable, I'll just be confirming the amount of damage we'd both be suffering later on, so i made the wise decision, or maybe the cowardly decision, hell if i know, i basically told her that this relationship is ending either way, we can end it now with both of us hurting, or end it after years of trying for a miniscule chance at success and suffer much more damage in the future, and so i told her that i want to end it.... i got different opinions on this decision from my friends, if you feel conflicted about me, or want to say that i gave up too soon, I'd get it




this came as gut shot to her, she was really upset by it, but seemed to also accept it at the moment, we agreed on no contact.




5 days later, she reaches out to my friend, urging him to convince me to keep fighting, we break no contract to talk about it, then next day her friend reaches out to me,  telling me how shes crying every day, and how much she can't see her this way. 3 more days pass, she breaks no contract again, she was really hostile, telling how i never loved her and how I'm just like my family and how much she hates me now.



we keep talking about it for like 30 minutes then something bizarre happened, she's begging now, keeps saying different permutations ""you can't just leave me, i love you more than anything and the love isn't decreased with time at all, i don't care if you marry me, i don't care if you convince your parents or not, just don't leave"" 




i was adamant on my decision, but after approximately 90 minutes of ""i don't give a shit, just stay with me"" i caved in, honestly i was terrified of her, she didn't seem stable, she was nore like a broken line of code outputting the exact same 4 words nonstop, it felt like she was upset in way that wasn't proportional to the situation, like someone in disbelief that their parents were murdered right infront of her, it honestly creeped me out, sure i was heartbroken as well, but she seemed to be in some sort of emergency, i could not in good conscience leave her like that so i accepted, i told her ""I'm here for you, not as a lover, not even as a friend, but I'll be here until you don't need me anymore"" 



till this day i don't know if i made the right decision there or not



here is when shit hit the fan, we stayed together, but i didn't keep my word, i fell back in love, i wasn't there for her until she got better, i was there as a lover, big fucking mistake, i can't just stsy in betweens like thst, either i choose to keep fighting my parents until the butter end or i cut contacts completely, me staying ""in betweens"" was something really really disappointing to me in retrospect, you can judge me all you want, what i did was a mistake, it was my first time falling in love and i did many things wrong.



this was the darkest period of our relationship, i really let my demons take the wheel, we kept on having arguments, our passion for each other kept on wavering and resurrecting, it was constantly on and off, we must have broken up and got back together 7 times in the span of 3 months, it was really really bad for our mental health, both of us, an era filled with false hope, re-ignition, and abject dread, we'd have a relationship ending fight one day and fsll in love again the next, it was hell.




so one day, we get into another fight, and we stop talking for 4 days, then she tells me out of the blue ""a guy proposed to me, he's seeing my parents tomorrow, i made a decision from a disoriented, anxious state of mind, this is final,  and this is our last conversation""




as you csn imagine, it wasn't a peaceful conversation 




30 days later, i change my bio into a kinda code thst only she and i could understand, she actually reaches out, asks about it, we chat for a bit, she tells thst she withdrew from the engagement last second before the ""mahr"" determination stage.
mahr is retarded tradition where the guy pays the girl a very large sum of money to the girl before legal engagement, and i do mean LARGE sum of money, equivalent to about 14 monthes of paychecks, or sometimes more, I've hesrt of someone paying the equivalent of 2 houses and a car, it's the dumbest shit in the universe. 




so we chat for a bit, she was distant and... off, she refused the engagement last second 2 weeks ago, ""half the time we spent apart"" and told me stuff like ""you ruined my life, i can't be good on my own or with someone else, you are the obstacle standing between me and peace, i want to forget you""




i kept on trying to get her to open up, to attempt to understand how we can deal with her emotionally chaos, we keep this up for about a week, then she tells me mid convo ""you are not a man, fuck your parents, fuck your mom in particular, you are just like them, i don't even care about you, i wush you never move on as retribution for how you hurt me, i wish you keep suffering until your future family sees it in your eyes, and i want your mom to suffer the brunt of the damage, don't even dare to call yourself a man""



her tone was playful and joyous, sadistic even, like she was holding the words in for a while, she seemed to relish in every word, and every person i showed the convo told me ""yeah i think she meant it"" she has also told me that I'm nothing to her now, and now she just regrets giving me a chance.




i spent the next week trying my hardest to appeal to her, telling her how i get it, and i don't blame her for the words even tho it really hurt me, and that i ultimately wish her peace, she'd reply one every blue moon, as i was restricted by her and she doesn't get notifications 



then out of the sudden she tells me that she's getting engaged again tomorrow and that i should stop reaching out already, she then IMMEDIATELY deletes those messages on the spot, i reach out again next day, then she tells it to me straight, that was the last time she ever sends me anything.




then from thst point for the next month, i keep stalking her socials, she really does seem genuinely happy with the new guy, she seems to love him to the same extent she loved me, she genuinely seemed moved on fully and i highly doubt she even thinks of me, a week after our last convo i sent her a wall of text giving both of us closure, i thanked her for the memories and wished her luck, it was written more for my closure i guess, she hasn't seen it till this day, stuck in delivered as of now, it was supposed to bring me closure, it actually backfired hard instead 





now believe me, i know, I've messed up a lot during this relationship, i know i wasn't the ideal boyfriend, but i can't for the life of me understand how fast she moved on, like i was nothing to her now, genuinely nothing, how is that even possible?
 my brain simply can't compute it.


it's been 4 months now, she's still happy, I'm still suffering, as much as i did the day it happened, i tried everything, i even forcibly made myself stop checking on her posts, but it doesn't seem to help much




did she... even love me at all..?",1,1757993254.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

it’s like he thinks he’s educating the rest of us when really he just sounds like a chase commercial on repeat. i swear if i hear the words “cashback hack” one more time i’m going to start charging him interest for wasting my time.

and THEN, one of the quiet econ girls in our group just casually drops that she uses one of those debit cards that reports to credit bureaus. she’s got no debt, a higher score than him, and didn’t even feel the need to flex about it. meanwhile, captain cashback is out here drowning because he couldn’t stop ordering Shake Shack. you should've looked at his face when she said that. dude was so embarrassed and stopped hanging out with us. no hate tho, we still wanna be friends with him.

I only have coffee with creamer and diet pop. But I'm a big lover of chocolate and sweets. I've been struggling with breaking through my current plateau since June. I lost 15 pounds since June 2024 though. 

I've decided that just like I completely cut out sugary drinks, I'm going to completely cut out the usual suspects that make losing weight so difficult: cookies, chocolate, muffins, chips, cake, and candy. 

I think some people are better with moderation, but I think I'm better at completely abstaining. I find that eating one cookie almost always leads to wanting more, more, more. I think it's better for me to just completely cut it out of my diet and focus on eating a more traditionally healthy diet with fruits, vegetables, meat, cheese, etc. 

There's the social aspect that makes this difficult: my mom loves baking goods and there's always cookies and cake around. The rest of my family is overweight and so it's hard to abstain fully. However, just like I've done with sugary drinks, I can choose to not partake in these things. I can eat the other stuff my mom cooks like lasagna, she'll just have to deal with me not eating her baked goods.

I know some people are able to budget in a cookie here or a bowl of ice cream there, but I really just don't think I'm cut out for that. I can't seem to control myself and I don't find enjoyment in just having a little bit of treats. ",2,1757992851.0,loseit,10,0.67,False

Sayat Nova: beautiful apricot pie smell, gourmandy drydown and I love it.

Lao Oud: chocolaty coffee and oud, nothing completely unique but smells quality nonetheless. Not animalic like most people say, just woody real oud.

Oud Malinau: the only one I dislike, very medicinal opening but performance is outstanding and drydown is a nice cinnamon oud with spices.

i ended up purchasing a full bottle of bianco latte 🤭 and i LOVE IT SO MUCHHHHH AGHHHH. it's honestly so yummy and sweet. i don't find it's too overpowering, except for the opening which has a strong synthetic smell. in general it's a strong fragrance, but it dies down pretty quickly on my skin, or maybe i just become blind to it like i mentioned. lasts forever on clothes, seriously. thank you guys for all of your advice and kind comments. if there are any fragrances you feel like i'd enjoy or would like to recommend, please do. i also tried intense cafe by montale, and i loved it as well. very rosy. anyway, bye! 🫶",3,1757992591.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

Alexander Vorontsov, head of the Korea-Mongolia Studies Department at the Institute of Oriental Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences, is speaking about Russia-North Korea relations, etc., at the 'Samcheong Forum' hosted by the Far East Institute at Kyungnam University on the 15th. /Courtesy of Kim Min-seo

Alexander Vorontsov, head of the Korea-Mongolia Studies Department at the Institute of Oriental Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences, said at the “Samcheong Forum” hosted by Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies on the 15th, “During my visit to Pyongyang last month on the occasion of August 15, I asked North Korean officials about the fate of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il’s unification legacy, but I only received a response that they would ‘report to superiors and provide an answer later’ and heard no further explanation.”

Since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s “anti-unification two-state policy” in late 2023, North Korea has demolished the “Monument to the Three Charters of the Fatherland,” which Kim Jong-un called a “disgrace,” and removed or changed all names containing the word “unification,” such as “Tongil Station,” “Tongil Street,” and “Tongil Market.” However, when asked by the Russian expert, North Korea failed to properly explain the abandonment of unification and its two-state policy toward the South.

Vorontsov is a Korean Peninsula expert with experience in both academia and diplomatic practice. He served as a second secretary at the Russian Embassy in North Korea from 2000–2002 and also studied at Kim Il-Sung University. Regarding the prospects for strengthened cooperation among North Korea, China, and Russia on the occasion of China’s recent victory anniversary, Vorontsov said, “One thing that can be said for sure is that Russia has absolutely no intention or plan to deploy strategic military assets in North Korea,” adding, “While the U.S., Japan, and South Korea are conducting actual military cooperation, such as joint military drills, the three countries of North Korea, China, and Russia have no such practical military cooperation at all.” He further stated, “In fact, China and Russia are not that close either.”

On the prospects for U.S.-North Korea dialogue, Vorontsov said, “Russia views demands for CVID-style denuclearization as unrealistic,” and “North Korea has no intention of engaging in such denuclearization talks.” He added, “However, what Russia is concerned about regarding North Korea is its unpredictability,” citing “unexpected actions not previously recognized by Russia, such as its relationship with President Donald Trump.” Vorontsov emphasized, “Russia is absolutely not opposed to improving North Korea-U.S. relations,” and “What Russia ultimately desires is stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula.”

Regarding the recent nomination of former Ambassador Lee Suk-bae, who served in Russia during the Moon Jae-in administration, as South Korea’s new ambassador to Russia, Vorontsov said, “This is a very well-made decision,” calling him “a diplomat who knows Russia well” and “a very positive sign for improving South Korea-Russia relations.” He added, “Russia-North Korea relations do not hinder South Korea-Russia relations,” and “South Korea’s participation in international sanctions against Russia is the biggest obstacle to bilateral relations.”

Vorontsov also shared his impressions of visiting Pyongyang last month as part of a Russian diplomatic delegation, touring areas like the “Hwasong District,” referred to as Pyongyang’s “new town.” He described the Hwasong District as having “very beautiful and aesthetically pleasing buildings that are harmonious and modern,” and noted that “Pyongyang citizens were eating various kinds of fruit, including strawberries, apples, and even mangoes, which are very expensive in Pyongyang.” He added that many cafes had emerged, saying, “Ten years ago, the only coffee machine in downtown Pyongyang was at an Italian restaurant, but this time, I saw that many cafes had opened, and coffee was very popular.”

First time poster here and so please be kind. I grew up in MN and attended the Ren Fair for the first time ever this weekend with some friends. It was so much fun - I had Mac and cheese potato skins, lemonade and almost bought a cool mug for my coffee from one of the shops. Also saw the show where they juggle knives on fire. Everyone looked awesome in their costumes!

Once I noticed the elephant and camel rides though, it kind of sucked the joy out of the experience. I’m a huge animal lover and have learned that elephants operate in an entirely different way than the way they are treated and made to provide rides at fairs like these. I won’t go too long here, but wanted to share info on this in the hopes that more people became aware of the cruelty that goes into making elephants and camels walk in small circles all day, and that this attraction can be replaced with something else some day. 

I know a few petitions are circulating out there but wanted to share this one too. I signed it and haven’t gotten any spam texts or unnecessary emails in case that prevents you from signing. 

Thanks for reading and signing if you are so inclined! 

TDLR: The elephant/camel rides made me super sad and confused as to why this is still an allowed attraction at the fair. Sharing petition in case others feel the same and can help to phase this out.

1ni67ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1ni67ca/the_street_lawyer_john_grisham/,The Street Lawyer – John Grisham,"Hey everyone! I've just wrapped up reading John Grisham's *The Street Lawyer*, and wow, what a ride it was. For those of you always on the hunt for a gripping story, or if you're curious about diving into a legal drama, you can learn more about [The Street Lawyer – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-street-lawyer-john-grisham/) to get started. I wanted to share my honest thoughts, almost like we're just chatting over coffee.

***

This book plunges you into the high-stakes world of Michael Brock, a hotshot corporate lawyer who seems to have it all. His life takes a drastic, unexpected turn when a homeless man holds him and his colleagues hostage. This traumatic event opens his eyes to a whole other side of the legal system—one that's far from the polished corporate offices he's used to. He finds himself caught between his comfortable, unethical past and a newfound moral compass, leading him down a dangerous path where he uncovers a shocking conspiracy. It’s a real page-turner, packed with twists and turns, without giving away any major plot points.

***

What truly grabbed me about this book was the way Grisham portrays Michael Brock's transformation. He starts off as someone you might not root for, but his journey of self-discovery and his growing conviction to fight for justice are incredibly compelling. You see him grapple with tough decisions, questioning everything he once held dear. The characters, even the minor ones, feel very real and well-fleshed out, adding layers to the story.

***

Grisham's writing style, as always, is sharp and to the point. He has this amazing ability to make complex legal jargon understandable and even exciting, which is no small feat! The pacing is fantastic; it starts with a bang and pretty much keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. There's a constant sense of urgency and danger that makes it really hard to put down. I especially loved how the book shed light on important social issues, making it more than just a thrilling plot. It actually made me think about things long after I closed the cover.

***

While I thoroughly enjoyed *The Street Lawyer*, I'd say if you're not particularly fond of legal details, there might be a few parts that slow down a tiny bit for you. Grisham does a great job simplifying things, but it’s still very much rooted in the legal world. Also, some readers might find the ending a little less explosive than the buildup, but personally, I felt it was a fitting and realistic conclusion to Michael's journey. It’s not a fairy tale, and the book doesn’t pretend to be.

***

So, would I recommend *The Street Lawyer*? Absolutely, yes! If you're a fan of thrillers, especially legal dramas, or if you enjoy stories about moral dilemmas and characters finding their purpose, then this book is definitely for you. It’s a classic Grisham that delivers exactly what you'd expect: suspense, a clever plot, and a dash of social commentary. If you typically read fantasy but want to try something grounded and intense, this could be a great entry point into the thriller genre.

***

For anyone who might be new to reading or perhaps intimidated by a book that sounds a bit complex, don't worry! Here's a little step-by-step guide and some encouragement:

1.  **Just Start:** The hardest part is often just opening the book. Give it a few chapters to draw you in.
2.  **Don't Overthink:** If you encounter a legal term you don't fully grasp, don't stop and Google it unless it completely blocks your understanding. Grisham usually provides enough context.
3.  **Find Your Rhythm:** Try to set aside specific times to read, even if it's just 15-20 minutes a day. Consistency helps you stay immersed in the story.
4.  **Embrace the Journey:** Sometimes a book feels slow at first, but character development and plot twists need time to build. Trust the author!
5.  **It's Okay to Take Breaks:** If you feel overwhelmed, step away for a bit. The story will be there when you're ready to pick it up again.

Reading is a personal adventure, and every book offers something new. *The Street Lawyer* is a fantastic example of a book that’s not just entertaining but also thought-provoking. Don't be afraid to try different genres and see what captures your imagination! You can dive right into this exciting narrative by finding [The Street Lawyer – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-street-lawyer-john-grisham/) today.

All in all, *The Street Lawyer* is a compelling read that stays with you. It’s a testament to Grisham’s skill in crafting engaging stories that also carry a deeper message. Whether you're a seasoned reader or just starting your literary journey, I think you'll find a lot to appreciate here. If my review has piqued your interest, why not give it a try?

The uppers fit perfectly, but the lowers looked very small and had very little lining—which I expected, since I have minimal gums. I had upper dentures for five years, and then, after having my lowers pulled four years ago, I waited a whole year to get my full set. I was so excited to finally have a beautiful, white smile because my previous dentures were yellowed due to discoloration on my lower teeth.

When I got my full set on September 3rd, 2025, I was beyond happy. The denturist did mention that if my dentures broke, my insurance wouldn’t cover repairs, no matter how the damage occurred. I had no issues with my uppers, so I didn’t think much of it.

During the first 24–48 hours, I noticed some adjustments were needed, so I followed her instructions using the paste and powder together. She also suggested a denture adhesive she sold in the office, but I decided to keep trying without it.

Today, my lowers suddenly started floating in my mouth. I took them out and set them on my coffee table while cleaning up a mess my dog had made. I didn’t even realize at the time, but when I returned, I saw my lowers had broken perfectly in half. I panicked. I called the denture office after hours to let them know, but I know they may not be able to fix them because of Molina.

I’m heartbroken. My husband said he would pay out of pocket to have them repaired, but I don’t even know if that’s possible since they were made while I was on Molina. I feel so stressed and overwhelmed—I don’t want to wait another five years to replace them.",1,1757991372.0,dentures,1,1.0,False

The Baltimore Orioles (69-80) and Chicago White Sox (57-93) are set to collide at Rate Field on September 16, 2025, in what promises to be a game so low-scoring it could be mistaken for a AAA contest. Both teams are on three-game losing streaks, making this an intra-division battle of ""Which also-ran has lower expectations?"" The betting line has the White Sox as favorites at +118, but their star pitcher, Sean Burke, has an ERA (4.35) that makes a sieve look like a fortress. Meanwhile, the Orioles’ Kyle Bradish is a 2.65 ERA enigma, somehow posting a 0-1 record that defies logic, like a vending machine that occasionally gives free snacks but never registers sales.

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For**  
Let’s crunch the numbers. The White Sox’s implied probability of winning (based on their -130 favorite status) is \~56.5%, while the Orioles sit at \~47.6%. On paper, this suggests the public—and perhaps the oddsmakers—have more faith in Chicago’s .298 team record than Baltimore’s .466 mark. But here’s the rub: Burke, Chicago’s starter, has allowed 4.35 runs per game, while Bradish has kept opponents to 2.65. It’s like pitting a leaky faucet (Burke) against a coffee filter (Bradish). The Orioles’ pitcher is so good, he’d probably out-pitch the White Sox’s offense, which ranks 29th in the majors in runs scored.

The total is set at 7.5 runs, with the Under priced slightly more attractively (-115 to -120). Given Bradish’s strikeout prowess (21 K’s in 17 2/3 IP) and Burke’s habit of surrendering three runs in his last start, this game could be drier than a martini made with a dehumidifier.

I have no car, and no license (Sad I know). I feel like I'm just wasting my time and potential by working, and I'm not even working towards anything that will payoff for me in the future. I admit to making poor financial decisions that I'm still to this day paying for. So I'm kind of at a point of willing to pick up and learn anything. Of course learn something that I can get a good career in. Im willing to put the time, work and effort. 

After I graduated High school I went straight to community college, completing only the fall semester. I was majoring in Biology, I actually wanted to do zoology or ecology, but unfortunately the school didn't offer those majors. I have a passion for animals, I would've loved to work at a wildlife rehab center. I adore all animals, I wanted to work with both aquatic and land animals. But after doing a bit of research i found that most careers that involve working with animals don't pay too well. I'm not looking to be a super rich, but I would like to have a stable job to afford my own place. Without any struggles or living check to check. 

I'm open to going back to school, but I have moved since then. So any classes that I take would have to fully be online. I have settled on the idea of just finding a good stable job and maybe volunteer at a shelter on my free time. It kind of sucks a bit, because my dream was to travel and work with animals at the same time. 

As of right now, I have been looking into Medical coding and Billing. The same community college that I had went to before, offers a program for Medical coding and Billing. So I've been thinking about applying for the program, I own a Macbook so I would mostly need to worry about the books they assign for the classes. I'm open to all you have to say, I would greatly appreciate any advice given. Thank you so much if you took the time out of your day to read this :).

The Tampa Bay Rays (73-76) and Toronto Blue Jays (87-62) clash Tuesday at George M. Steinbrenner Field, a venue where the Rays have stumbled badly this season, losing 14 of 19 games. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, are on a September tear, having won 8 of their last 12, and could clinch a playoff berth as early as Wednesday. Let’s break this down with the precision of a catcher blocking a pitch and the humor of a umpire who’s had one too many cups of coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The betting lines tell a tight story. On FanDuel, the Rays are priced at **+1.85** (implied probability: \~54%) and the Blue Jays at **+2.00** (\~50%). Other books like BetOnline.ag and DraftKings show slight fluctuations, but the consensus is clear: this is a near-50/50 toss-up with a sprinkle of vigorish on top. The spread favors Toronto (-1.5 runs) at odds of roughly **-200**, meaning bookmakers expect the Jays to win by more than a run. The total is set at **8.5 runs**, with the **Under** slightly more valuable (odds \~1.93 vs. 1.88 for the Over).

Why the tight lines? The Rays’ stellar **3.91 ERA** (12th in MLB) and the Blue Jays’ anemic **4.16 ERA** (19th) suggest a low-scoring affair. But Toronto’s offense—led by George Springer’s 29 HRs and Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s .304 average—is a wrecking ball. Tampa’s offense? Well, it’s like a toaster in a bakery: present, but not particularly useful. They average just **1.1 HRs per game**, ranking 15th in MLB.

---

### Team News: Caminero’s Quest and Yesavage’s Debut

The Rays’ 21-year-old third baseman, **Junior Caminero**, is two HRs shy of the team record. He’s hitting .262 with 44 bombs and 108 RBIs, which is impressive for someone who still might be figuring out how to adult.

For the food, this was organized by meal.  On the food bin: ""Friday Dinner- Walking tacos: chili, chips, salsa."" On the cooler: Friday Dinner- Walking tacos: cheese, green onions, salad greens""... this was written out for each day and each meal... ""Saturday breakfast- oatmeal cups, fruit cups and coffee."" I dont typically use so many disposables, but can also really help make cleanup easier. The index cardw required some time plannimg to write everything out, but it made packing super easy, and pulling things out at meal time was a dream! Of course, people ate Saturday's lunch cheese and sausage on the first night, and nobody felt like eating the salad, but we made it through the whole weekend without my typical stress, making multiple trips to pull out the right ingredients for each meal. My ADHD really requires structure like kindergarten style cubbies and chore charts, or else things fall into chaos. This was exactly what I needed! ",12,1757991051.0,camping,1,1.0,False

**TL;DR: How to Earn & Maximize Capital One Miles**

* **Earning**
   * Venture card = 2x miles on everything + bonus rewards on travel, dining, and entertainment.
   * SUB: 75k miles after $4k spend in 3 months.
   * No caps, no expiration as long as your account is active.
* **Redeeming**
   * **Capital One Travel**: flights, hotels, cars (with perks like price drop protection & cancel for any reason).
   * **Statement credits**: $120 credit for Global Entry / TSA PreCheck.
   * **Transfers**: Airline & hotel partners at 1:1, 1:1.25, 1:1.5, or 1:2 ratios (Delta, United, Air France/KLM, Turkish, Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, etc.).
* **Pro tips**
   * Transfer to partners (especially Air France/KLM, Turkish, Hyatt) for the best value.
   * Use the Venture for all travel spend to stack miles quickly.
   * Keep accounts active and names matching for transfers.
   * Venture has a $95 AF → worth it if you use perks + transfers.
* **Alternatives**
   * **QuicksilverOne**: no AF, 1.5x cash back.
   * **Quicksilver Secured**: good for rebuilding credit.

**Bottom line:** Venture is a strong “earn 2x everywhere + transfer for outsized value” card. But if you’re not traveling enough to justify the $95 fee, Quicksilver/QuicksilverOne might be better.

# Hey there!

Let’s talk about **Capital One miles** — how to earn, use, and transfer them. If you're into travel rewards or just want a solid way to get value from your spending, this is a great system to understand. I’ll walk you through it step by step.

# 🛒 How to Earn Capital One Miles

Capital One has a few great cards for earning miles, and the **Venture card** is one of the top picks. Here’s how it works:

* **Double Miles on Everything**: You get **2 miles per dollar on all purchases**, no matter what you buy — groceries, gas, travel, or even your morning coffee.
* **Bonus Categories**: On top of the base 2x, you earn **elevated rewards** when you use the card for:
   * **Capital One Travel** (flights, hotels, car rentals)
   * **Capital One Entertainment** (event tickets)
   * **Dining** (restaurants, takeout, delivery)
* **Sign-Up Bonus**: If you open a Venture card, you can earn a **75,000-mile bonus** after spending **$4,000 in the first 3 months**. That’s a solid head start for booking a trip or transferring miles.

You don’t have to worry about **miles expiring** — they stay in your account forever as long as it’s active. No caps, no limits, just keep earning.

# 🎟️ How to Redeem Capital One Miles

Once you’ve got miles, you can **redeem them in a few flexible ways**, depending on your goals.

# 1. Book Travel Through Capital One Travel

You can use your miles to book:

* Flights
* Hotels
* Car rentals
* Vacations

The system is pretty user-friendly, and it helps you find deals using tools like:

* **Price Prediction** (estimates how prices might change)
* **Price Watch** (tracks fare changes)
* **Price Drop Protection** (if a flight price drops after booking, you get a refund)
* **Cancel for Any Reason** (let’s you cancel a flight and get a portion of your miles back)

You can also get **15% average savings on flights**, which is a big deal if you travel often.

# 2. Statement Credits for Travel Perks

If you’re into airport perks, you can get a **$120 statement credit** toward **Global Entry** or **TSA PreCheck®** when you pay the fee with your Venture card. This is one of the best features for frequent travelers or anyone who wants a smoother airport experience.

# 3. Transfer Miles to Partners

This is where things get really powerful. You can **transfer miles to airline and hotel loyalty programs**. Here’s how the transfer ratios work:

* **1:1** for most airline partners (e.g., Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, Virgin Australia)
* **1:1.25** for a few select partners (e.g., British Airways, Singapore Airlines)
* **1:1.5** for some elite partners (e.g., Delta SkyMiles, United MileagePlus)
* **1:2** for a few high-value partners (e.g., Air France/KLM, Turkish Airlines)

You’ll need **at least 1,000 miles** to transfer, and the names on your Capital One account and the loyalty program must match. Once you transfer, those miles become **subject to the rules of the receiving program** — and they can’t be transferred back, so it’s a one-way trip.

# 🔄 Capital One Miles Transfer Partners

Here’s a quick look at some of the **major transfer partners**:

# ✈️ Airlines

* **Alaska Airlines** (1:1)
* **JetBlue** (1:1)
* **Virgin Australia** (1:1)
* **British Airways** (1:1.25)
* **Air France/KLM** (1:2)
* **Turkish Airlines** (1:2)
* **United Airlines** (1:1.5)
* **Delta Airlines** (1:1.5)

These ratios make it easy to get a **strong return on your miles**, especially if you fly with one of these carriers regularly.

# 🏨 Hotels

* **Choice Privileges** (1:1)
* **Marriott Bonvoy** (1:1)
* **Hilton Honors** (1:1)

Transferring to hotel programs can be especially useful for **free stays** or **upgrades**, depending on how you use the miles.

# 📱 How to Transfer Miles

If you’re ready to transfer your Capital One miles, you can do it through:

* **Capital One Mobile App**
* **Online Banking Portal**

Just go to the **Rewards section**, select **Transfer Miles**, and choose the loyalty program you want. Make sure your account is in good standing, and the name matches the one on your partner account. Once you confirm, the miles are transferred and **can’t be reversed**.

# 🧠 Pro Tips for Maximizing Capital One Miles

* **Use the Venture card for all travel-related spending** to get the most out of elevated rewards and transfer options.
* **Keep your Capital One account active** to maintain your miles and avoid expiration.
* **Track your miles** using the app or online tools. Capital One makes it easy to see how you're doing.
* **Plan transfers strategically** — if you know you're going to book with Delta or United, transferring your miles early can help you lock in a better rate.
* **Combine with other Capital One cards** if you’re a higher spend-er. For example, the **Capital One Quicksilver** or **QuicksilverOne** cards offer **1.5x cash back on everything**, and they don’t have an annual fee.

# 🚨 Things to Watch Out For

* **No Transfer Back**: Once you transfer your miles, they’re gone. You can’t bring them back into your Capital One account.
* **Name Matching**: The name on your Capital One card and the loyalty program must be the same for transfers to work.
* **Partner Rules**: Each airline and hotel program has its own redemptions and blackout dates. Always check the fine print on their sites.
* **Annual Fee**: The **Venture card has a $95 annual fee**, so you’ll want to make sure you’re earning enough in rewards or using the benefits to justify it.

# 🧾 Alternative Cards for Miles or Cash Back

If the Venture card feels like too much with the fee, you might consider:

* **Capital One QuicksilverOne**: No annual fee, 1.5x cash back on everything.
* **Capital One Quicksilver Secured**: Great for rebuilding credit, 1.5x cash back with no fee.

These are good for people who want **flexibility without the annual cost**.

# ✅ Final Thoughts

Capital One’s miles system is one of the most flexible in the market, especially if you travel with partner airlines or hotels. The Venture card is a top-tier option for those who want to earn 2x on everything and transfer miles to get more value per dollar. But it’s not for everyone — if you don’t spend much on travel or can’t justify the $95 fee, the Quicksilver or QuicksilverOne might be a better fit.

The key is to **align your spending with the best rewards** and **plan your redemptions** so you’re not just earning miles, but actually using them to get real value — whether that’s free flights, airport perks, or statement credits.",1,1757990815.0,BONCredit,0,1.0,False

A little about me: I stay balanced through fitness, whether it’s hitting the gym, keeping active with workouts, or kick-starting my mornings with a run (don’t worry, I’m usually faster than my excuses). I also love traveling—not for the miles, but for the stories and snacks along the way.

1ni5tm2,https://i.redd.it/q05h3qq6wfpf1.png,FDX - Earning week,"Let me be clear.  I'm biased.   FEDEX is my creative inspiration.  To me it has one of the greatest logo ever created on earth.  that hidden Arrow is brilliant.   I can't ever see it.   Whenever it's FDX, SBUX, NKE or UPS it just makes me happy just by looking the logo.   I know it's irrelevant to this discussion, but we form bias.  My love for FDX is predetermined.   and it's hard to be unbiased because I root for them subconsciously.   
  
We all use FedEX.  It's the company that delivers your impulse Amazon buys at 2am and somehow still makes it show up the next day. They move boxes, pallets, and basically the entire economy. Express shipping, ground, freight, international logistics.  they do it all. Not sexy like AI or crypto but literally everything you order online touches them at some point.  Without FedEX we simply can't function well. 

**Why even look at it**

Everyone freaks out about recession fears especially when we are at ATH and trade wars and thinks FDX is slow and boring. But here is the thing. E-commerce is still growing. Businesses still need to ship stuff. FedEx keeps upgrading their network, adding automation, and cutting costs quietly. They throw off tons of cash, pay a small dividend, and they have enough scale that competitors have a hard time touching them.

Earnings can be the spark. If they beat, stock pops. If they guide up for cost savings or e-commerce volume, stock pops. Even if macro is meh, this is not a company that goes bankrupt tomorrow.

**Current setup**

Stock is $225.   I recently swung between 230-240.  it couldn't sustain the move and flopped back down to low 220s.     People treat FedEx like the grandpa stock in their portfolio. PE is reasonable. Growth is steady, slow, not hyped. But that is the whole play. You are not trying to double tomorrow. You are playing optionality. Earnings, holiday shipping season, cost cuts, AI logistics efficiency announcements - these are the catalysts.

# Bullish scenario $225 to $300+.  Now this is bit what if.  it could easily reverse back below $200

1. **E-commerce explosion continues** More packages, more deliveries, more cash. Simple. FedEx is still getting more of the pie every year.
2. **Cost savings actually work** Drive program and network efficiency upgrades are real. They save billions over time and improve margins. Less money wasted, more in EPS, more stock price love.
3. **Global logistics domination** International business is growing. Emerging markets need packages too. FedEx has the infrastructure to dominate where smaller rivals can barely keep up.
4. **Optional catalyst fuel** Earnings beat, macro calm, holiday shipping hype, AI logistics tools. Each one is a short term booster for shares or options.
5. **Valuation expansion** Right now stock is reasonable. If markets rotate back into industrial growth plays or investors notice how profitable FedEx actually is, PE expansion alone can take it a lot higher.

# Play it

* **LEAPs**: Jan 2027 $250C or $275C. Let the long term work while you sip your coffee.
* **Earnings short swing**: I don't do earnings. I used to buy lotto calls drop 2k here and there, but I'm just not that lucky.  Instead, I trade the day after earning.  If earning is strong then wait till it pops then drops. 
* **200EMA, 4hr chart break swing -** Look for a penetration after earning success, wait till the retest.  if it retests then consider buying call 2 months out premium under $4.   

# TLDR

FedEx is boring until it is not. $225 stock could hit $300 plus in 2 to 3 years if e-commerce keeps growing, cost cuts stick, global expansion works, and earnings give short term bursts. Slow growth but huge optionality. Good for chill LEAPs, earnings swings, or just watching boxes move the world.",1,1757990455.0,Options_Beginners,0,1.0,False

Yes, house prices are high compared to the past few decades, now that is out of the way.

Post-secondary schooling feels like a scam. 90% of the time, it's a total scam these days! Out of high school no one helps kids look at what jobs are available in different fields and sectors, what they typically pay, etc. So you get all these kids who don't know what they want to be pick something random that may be an extremely competitive field, a low paying field, 99% freelance work, or just flatout have no jobs.

I know people who went to post-secondary for visual arts, dance, music, etc. Guess what, good luck finding a job in anything related to that. Another guy went to school for aerospace engineering, guess what? There are like zero jobs that exist in Canada so now he's a ""technical writer"" aka writing manuals all day. Even my friend who is a lawyer can't afford a home as they spent 4 years doing an undergrad followed by 3 years of law school, this entire time racking up insane school debt and not really earning anything, so now at 25 she is just beginning to start paying down her massive debt. It's a sad day when prestigious jobs like being a lawyer can set you far behind like that. There are so many useless degrees out there that won't land you a job in any relevant field or are so overly generic they don't actually teach you anything useful. The schools are happy to take your money and make you believe it's worth it though.

In our parents day, I think it actually was worth it. My mother always liked to say that in her day a degree in anything would guarentee you a job. Maybe not any job you wanted, but as long as you had the paper you could find something decent. These days you get so many kids with degrees working as a cashier or receptionist (my workplace receptionist is 26 and has a degree in criminal justice). Not to mention a lot of places don't want to hire math students or kids with only theoretical knowledge, zero real world experience often translates to ""can't do anything"". All the kids just out of university may cry ""how am I supposed to get experience without getting a job?!"" The answer? You are supposed to do summer internships, apprenticeships, co-ops, while in school to help you get a job after school. That is all experience that goes on the resume.

So after all this ranting, what's my suggestion? It's pretty simple. Pick something with jobs available in the location you want to work. How do you do that? Research, ask on reddit, go to job fairs, the information is out there. I went to school for electrical engineering, would I have rather been a video game developer? Sure, but who wouldn't? It's an oversaturated industry where the only work available is sweat shop level work at a big company or freelance indie work. You're looking to be financially stable in the future, not do your dream job. If you want to do your dream job and go be a musician then sure, follow your heart, but I don't want to hear about it when you work at a coffee shop and make no money (another person I know's situation). Second, quality over quantity. Every year in school is another year or wracking up student debt while also not working and making money. A 2-3 year college course may make more financial sense than a 4 year bachelor + 2 years masters degree, etc. Especially if you aren't rich or don't have parents helping you out. That student loan has to be paid back some day. I was already promoted to Senior in my field by the time my lawyer friend was just starting to work, not to mention my 3 year college program student debts were paid off by the time I finished school by working summers and part time. I could have done a bachelors followed by a masters degree, but unless i'm going to move into the big city and get a higher up position i'm never going to see return on that investment working in my smaller city outside Toronto. Moving into the city may make you more money, but then you also have higher living expenses and/or time commuting. Making an extra 10$/hr doesn't mean anything if you spend an extra 2 hours every day commuting to/from work unpaid.

Anyways, this is just my rant. So many young people can't afford to buy a house because they spent so many years in school wracking up debt to get a degree in a field no one is hiring in, and it's painful to see.

1ni5lli,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1ni5lli/i_asked_chatgpt_to_be_my_cofounder_and_it_gave_me/,I asked ChatGPT to be my cofounder and it gave me emotional support — anyone else?,"Okay founders, consultants, and weary product people — quick show of hands: who else is getting pep talks from a chatbot at 2 a.m.? Recent reporting (shoutout to Kylie Jones at FOX 13 Tampa Bay) and new studies show something obvious and terrifying — people are using AI like ChatGPT for companionship, not just for code or coffee-fueled MVPs.

Let’s be honest. Chatbots are always there, never judge your pivot, and will say “I believe in you” without asking about runway. They’re convenient, responsive, and scandalously good at sounding empathetic. If you’re burned out, lonely, or simply allergic to networking, an AI that remembers your birthday and laughs at your “brutal honesty” jokes is incredibly tempting.

But don’t confuse convenience with therapy. Researchers find that heavy use of companion-driven AI correlates with lower well-being in some groups — the classic social compensation effect where people with fewer offline supports lean harder on synthetic ones. The bot doesn’t replace human nuance, messy accountability, or the awkward but critical feedback from a cofounder who actually owns equity.

Practical takeaways for you building or using these tools:
- Design guardrails: nudge users toward human help for crises and set gentle usage limits.
- Transparency matters: label when the bot is playing “friend” vs. giving factual guidance.
- Measure dependency signals: if engagement is emotional and escalating, trigger a human check-in.

If you’re an indie hacker shipping an “AI roommate MVP,” congratulations — you might be building habit-forming companionship. That’s product-market-fit for loneliness, and maybe a moral hazard.

So what should founders do? Build responsibly, don’t gaslight users about what the bot can do, and include handoffs to real humans. Skeptics: don’t roll your eyes; this is real behavior change. Consultants: start asking clients how they use AI socially, not just operationally.

In short: we invented on-demand empathy. It’s cute, useful, and capable of becoming a crutch. Meme it, ship it, but also: monitor it.",1,1757989806.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I honestly feel like I'm being patented or belittled for being an introvert. Both for not having me time alone and not doing things with the kids. 


No I don't want ""me time."" No I don't want to go to ""just go get a coffee"" by myself. Or even group activities. I don't need to have a social engagement every single day of the week. I'm very much okay being inside or in my own yard just me and the kids and my husband when hes not working. I have friends, I enjoy seeing them. But doing things with kids is tiring and more often than not, no matter what the outing, I come home in much worse shape mentally then when I left. 


Before kids, I worked. A lot. I don't have hobbies, and I don't feel I'm missing out anything. Being a mom is NOT my personality or anything like that. I just am a basic introvert that enjoys being in my own space. I am do seriously okay with just that. I'm not depressed or longing for more. Nor do I ask anything of anyone, though of course family is always welcome (I guesssssss😅) I'm not secluded and have done parks and zoos and we do yard hangs in the summer. But I have a very difficult baby and a toddler and the resulting tension migraine and disturbed sleep patterns just aren't worth it to me.

My mother had not given me a chance to say otherwise and a week later, we were all ready, having packed our bags and arranged them in the trunk of the car.

""Deborah, what are you doing?"" I look up to see her, staring at me with soft eyes. 

""Nothing."" I say quickly as I pull my hands away from the bed and pick up the last bag I had to carry. 

“Look,” She stops me at the door post, running a hand over her face. Mum looked mostly frustrated, not at peace for half of the time I've known her. ""I know you don't want to leave. But...I can't stay here. It's hectic and it's toxic for me."" She releases a sigh slowly.

“I know.” My voice was quiet. She wants me to understand her –which I do– but I also want the same. Understanding was meant to be mutual.

We have lived here all of our lives and then just changing environment, changing everything I have tried to adapt to, it was crazy and confusing at the same time.

She looks at me for another moment, before giving up. Then, I walk out of the door and out of the house, putting the last of my bags into the trunk.

“You should cut your hair when we get to the pack.” She observed as soon as she got into the driver's seat. 

“I'll braid it.” I say uninterestedly. She wanted me to have shoulder hair length like her. It looked…. professional, in her words. But I wasn't interested. I place my earbuds in my ears and blast full music, drowning out her voice as I lay back on the passengers seat.

I watch the normal human world disappear and soon replaced with trees, forests and all other things that defines a good werewolf habitat. Moonthorne was a pack that kept itself out of the matters of human nature, couldn't blame them. No one knew when the human would attack wolves with all the new hypothesises going on in their minds. But it was strangely where I was comfortable, largely because I grew up there all my life. I've never been to Moonthorne and I never thought I'd be either. But here it was.

My stomach churns and my hands turns clammy as I rub them against each other. This is going to be another strange phase of my life and I can't help but hope it'll be better than before, especially at school.

I think I fell asleep because the next time I opened my eyes, we were already packed in front of a small portable bungalow. I stare at the house with something less than interest and the mixed feelings remained in my heart. I didn't know what to feel about this.

“Come out and help me, Bora.” My mother says as she opens the door and hops out of it. 

I sigh, pushing my anxiety to the dustbin of my mind before I get outside the car, pulling my earbuds off. Outside the gate, I hear people making a hell of a noise and judging from the sounds, they seem to be students. 

“Deborah.” Mom stares at me frustratingly and I turn, walking towards her. 

The house was clean as we place our things inside. My head made a mental judgement that my mom must have hired someone to clean it up before we arrived.

“Drop your bag. We are going to greet the alpha.” 

“Can't we do that tomorrow?” I ask.

“No, Deborah. I don't want trouble on our first day here. Moonthorne is not a place to mess up.” 

“Are you trying to scare me?” I place my hands in my pocket as my mom looks at me. She sighes, walking forward to touch the bangs in front of my hair.

“I'm not, Deborah. I just want us to leave a good life here. Is that so much to ask? Be good, hmm. Please. You are no longer a child. You have to grow up. In a few months time, you'll be 18, you'll have to meet your mate. Do you want to keep acting this way forever?” 

I stare at her for a long time, feeling her hands brush my hair down, before I finally open my mouth to speak. “I'm sorry.”

“It's fine. Now, let's go. Alpha Dryus’s house is just a five minute drive.” She says and pull me along into the car. 

On getting to the large mansion with lights that lighted up the whole street, I met Alpha Dryus and his wife, Luna Monica. She has the most pleasant smile in the world. 

“Come, take a seat.” She pulled us enthusiastically into the beautiful mansion, interiorly designed like a white palace. Flawless, too clean. It feels heavenly, the kind of place I'll love to be without a single disturbance from anyone.

“Evelyn, it's been so long.” She shakes her head at my mother who gives her a small smile.

“How many years did you take to decide whether to come back or not?” The Luna asks and then, before my mum could speak, she turns.

“ Hold on, let me get us cups of coffee. Anna! Anna! Oh God, where is this girl? Sama–” She turns to me, “What's your name?”

“Bora.” I reply quietly.

“Bora. Darling, why don't you go into the kitchen and get us four cups of coffee? You are good with the coffee maker, right?” I barely nod, before she adds, “The kitchen is that way.”

I glance at my mom and the quiet Alpha Dryus before I get up, walking towards the kitchen. Their voices drown out behind me.

“Aah..” I heave a sigh the moment I get into the empty kitchen. I was the only living thing in it, just exactly what I need after going all around since morning. I wish it could be like this forever…me and me alone and maybe…my dad.

Realizing that the Luna must be waiting for me, I quickly made the cups of coffee and place them on a tray. 

Call me stupid for I didn't see the hindrance standing right at my front before I emptied four cups of hot coffee right on it. 

“Damn it!” 

Oh great! The hindrance speaks.

For context, I live in an apartment complex where each unit is allowed one (covered) parking space that is paid for monthly, all other non-covered spaces are free for all/first come first serve parking spaces. The free parking spaces are somewhat limited, and after about 6 when everyone is getting off work, they do fill up fast and you usually have to park farther away and walk which is inconvenient but it’s just the reality when every apartment unit has 2-3 cars. 

I’ve lived here for two years and always parked in the same spot or the other two spots directly next to it. I work from home so there are times when the car is sitting there for a couple days, however I do usually take my car out in the morning several times a week, to get coffee or to run errands and when I come back, “my spot” is still open so I park in the same spot again. 

While I understand someone getting annoyed if they have to park farther and they always see my car parked in the same spot- considering it’s first come first serve parking- It honestly baffles me that someone had the audacity to write a note as if I need to inconvenience myself just because they are inconvenienced??Like, if you have to walk farther that’s not really my issue, I’m entitled to park here as much or as little as I please. 

So AITA for always parking in the same spot, even when I know I may not use my car again for a couple days? Am I wrong for thinking the person who wrote the note has some serious audacity? ",1,1757989378.0,AmItheAsshole,12,0.57,False
1ni5g1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ni5g1y/any_advice_22f_31m/,any advice '22F' & '31M',"This will be long I apologize. I '22F' have been dating my '31M' for six months. We have never really had any issues and overall everything is great. Our communication is really good, we have great chemistry and previously our sex life was really good.

let me preface with I place a lot of importance on sex. I know it’s something that I need to work on but sex is really important to me. It’s not really about the act it’s more about feeling desired and wanted and just being close to that person. I also have diagnosed BPD and tend to get overly emotional,overthink things,and I'm constantly over analysing reasons why I'm not enough.

when we first started dating we would have sex every time, most the time multiple times while I was there. We also are only able to see each other every two weeks on the weekend due to his job.

This past weekend I wanted to have sex and I kept initiating and it just felt like he was pushing me away which made me feel super insecure and embarrassed. It wasnt about sex it was about wanting to feel close to him and be desired by him. Well I brought it up a few times and we had a few different conversations about it.

The first one was I got upset and I cried to him and told him that I missed him throughout the week a lot and that I wasn’t trying to make him feel guilty for saying that it's just hard. I worded it that way because I felt super angry towards myself for feeling upset when I should just be greatful to be around him and I should cherish the few weekends I get with him. After that I told him it also kind of hurt my feelings when he pushed me away when I tried to go down on him and he said he didn’t push me away and he apologized and said that he felt bad for seeming like that. (I also wanted to add that after I told him about how I miss him he said that he misses me too, and he feels really guilty throughout the week for not being able to be with me)

The next morning I was a little upset because we still hadn't had sex and I was just beating myself up. Between feeling guilty for feeling that way and feeling undesirable. I got up before him and when we woke up I asked him if he wanted to go to the bedroom (I brought my new puppy over and didn't want to do it in front of her) he asked why and I said because I wanted to have sex with him and he said to let him wake up a bit and then we can.

Come mid day I asked him if there was anything I could do to be more appealing to him. He said no and asked me why I asked that. I explained to him how I was feeling and we talked about it. He said he wanted to have sex with me and he would later. And I communicated I also would like him to work on initiating more and he took accountability for that and said that he would work on that and he apologized. It was a good conversation and that was also the first time I asked him to work on something.

Well after that we watched a few movies and he got up to go get coffee and I pulled him in for a kiss and he gave me a peck and walked away. I sat there basically pouting for 30ish minute in my head and he noticed so I finally told him what was wrong. he also said that he felt like I looked at him like I was disgusted after I kissed him, and I said I didn’t it just kind of hurt my feelings that he pulled away. I apologized for being super emotional today and in my head. he apologized, and he said he felt bad for making me upset, and that the reason he pulled away was because he hadn’t brushed his teeth yet, and he didn’t mean to make me upset, then we hugged.

a little while later, he asked me if I wanted to play cards and I said I want to have sex with you lol. And he said let's play cards first and then we can. Well, we drank the night before and he already had a pretty bad hangover and then he drank again and he got pretty sick. He was pretty nauseous. he laid down on the couch and I went to go cuddle with him, and I kept asking him if there was anything that I could do for him or get him to make him feel better. he said no and then he said he should’ve listened to me and had sex before we played cards and that he felt bad he wouldn’t be able to and that made me feel so horrible and guilty. I joked with him that he stuck with me forever and we have plenty of time to have sex and I apologize for being super emotional today and in my head I told him that I’m just scared and I feel like I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop and he asked me what I meant and I told him that things have been going so well for so long and I’m just scared that he’s going to get tired of me and he said he thinks it’s the opposite that things just get better and better and they have been getting better and better and if anything, we’re just continue to get stronger. I held him and stroked his hair.

overall I just feel really horrible that I was in my head the whole time we hung out and I didn’t cherish the moments that I had. I also just feel so insecure right now and undesirable. I came on to him at least 10 plus times when I was over there. I came on to him before we were super drunk. I came on him before he was super sick so if he truly wanted to have sex with me, why not during those times? and I am nervous to see him or hang out with him again now because I’m scared that the next time we hang out it’s just gonna be the same thing we’re not gonna have sex and the next time after that and the next time after that. and it’s just gonna keep proving to me over and over and over there’s something wrong with me. or if we do have sex, which honestly how I’m feeling right now I highly doubt it will just be a pity fuck.

I also would like to clarify for the past two months our sex life has been a little off just due to life circumstances which I guess is causing me to feel this way as well. Two months ago we went to go visit my family and we didn't have sex due to being so preoccupied. Then two weeks later we did and he didnt stay up the whole time which he said was due to alcohol but we've gotten drunk and had sex many times with no issues. And then there was this time. Due to the two week gaps we have to go the time in between stacks up.

I know I may be making a mountain out of a mole hill and I'm alo not upset at him just myself.

1ni5do5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ni5do5/my_mom_committed_suicide/,My Mom Committed Suicide,"My childhood was bad. My mom was horribly abusive to me. Mentally and physically. She would constantly belittle me, insult me, scream at me, she would make fake accounts online and harass me, at one point she even sent me (a teenager) a message telling me to kill myself. Every day I spent in fear of what she'd do next. My parents eventually split up after I moved out. I stopped contact with my father, and continued with my mother as she lived with my grandma whom I adore. In April, a month after I had my first child, she started screaming at my grandmother and getting in her face. At one point spit in her face, threw coffee by her, and would slam cupboards and doors. All behavior she'd do while I was growing up. My grandma put up with this for a month and a half, tip toeing around her own home all while all while still being abused by her own daughter. I eventually had enough and messaged her that I can't allow my daughter to be around someone like that, and that she still never addressed the things she did in the past and now was actively abusing my grandmother in her own home. She said ""congrats. I guess I have no family"" and overdosed on prescription medication that night. 
I wish things were different. I wish she loved me. I wish she apologized. Why did it have to be this way? Maybe I shouldn't have sent the message. Would things be different? ",10,1757989159.0,GriefSupport,3,0.92,False

1ni5dc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ni5dc4/i_work_at_a_college_serving_coffee_to_really/,i work at a college serving coffee to really wealthy students. one of the students tailgated me and was an asshole driver so now i’m sobbing at home,"my day started with a group of boys filming me and my older coworker. they were laughing with each other loudly and saying things in a language i didn’t understand. basically it felt like they were making fun of us while filming. before i could say anything to them they walked away. i felt so dehumanized and like an animal in a zoo.

this college is in an extremely affluent town in my state. majority of the kids who go to school here are extremely wealthy (also a lot of international kids) 

i can viscerally feel the class difference everyday im at work. but the thing is i was born and raised in the next town over (also extremely affluent town). i was constantly surrounded my whole childhood by this class difference.

anyways, to top off my horrible day….. as im leaving the campus a student driver is behind me. the second i pull out of that campus they’re on my fucking ass. we pull up to a red light with the left lane turning left and the right line going straight. he goes in the left lane and i’m sitting in the lane going straight. when the light turns green he stomps on his gas and cuts me off.

i know asshole drivers and asshole customers are as common as pigeons in nyc but it got to me today so now i’m sobbing in bed.

1ni5b8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1ni5b8c/the_reason_you_cant_focus_is_because_of_your/,the reason you can't focus is because of your phone and social media,"i used to think there was something wrong with me because i couldn’t focus. like, i’d sit down to study with the best intentions, but 10 minutes later i’d find myself scrolling instagram, tiktok, whatever. i’d get frustrated and tell myself i just wasn’t disciplined enough, and then i’d try to “power through” with even more willpower… which obviously never worked.

it finally clicked for me when i realized it wasn’t just about my lack of discipline and it was about how my phone and social media were literally rewiring my brain. every notification, every quick scroll, was training me to crave instant stimulation. no wonder sitting with a textbook for an hour felt impossible. i wasn’t bad at focusing, my brain had been conditioned to *not* focus.

once i understood that, i started making changes. at first, i did the usual stuff: putting my phone across the room, using screen time limits, even turning it completely off. it helped a little, but i’d always find ways around it when i was tired or stressed. what finally worked for me was flipping the script. instead of trying to FIGHT my PHONE, i turned it into part of my STUDYING.

i set up my phone so that every time i opened a distracting app like TikTok or Instagram, i had to answer a quick review question first. at first it was kind of annoying, but then it became a habit. those tiny little questions ended up adding *so much* extra practice to my day without me even noticing. like, i’d be standing in line for coffee or about to scroll before bed, and boom, i’d sneak in a bit of bio or chem review. over weeks, those micro study sessions stacked up way more than my actual sit-down study sessions.

by doing this, i didn’t just cut down on distractions, i actually retrained my brain. my phone stopped being the thing that pulled me away from my work and started becoming a tool to keep me on track. this was where the iOS app QuizScreen really helped -  it was simple, but effective at keeping me accountable every single time i mindlessly reached for my phone.

looking back, i don’t think most people realize just how much their phone is draining their focus. we blame ourselves for being lazy or unmotivated, when really we’re just being hit with a constant stream of dopamine that our brains can’t compete with. once you take back control, whether that’s by physically separating yourself from your phone, or by turning it into a study tool like i did, the difference is night and day.

if you’ve been struggling to focus, it’s probably not because you don’t care enough or aren’t working hard enough. it’s because you’re fighting a battle against a machine that’s designed to distract you. the best move isn’t just more willpower, it’s creating systems that make focus the default. once you experience what deep, uninterrupted study feels like, you’ll never want to go back.",4,1757988959.0,studytips,0,0.84,False
