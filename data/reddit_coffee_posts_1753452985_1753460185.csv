So, let me mention all the important parts in brief. Saw a girl checking me out. Found her cute. Wanted to ask her out from past few days. Sat beside her yesterday (I arrived early and she sat next to me). Initiated a small and polite conversation regarding accademic and after the class was over again I initiated conversation which went nice. Wanted to ask her out yesterday but couldn't do it. Today also I arrived early and sat in that position only but today it was congested, she came and sat in the back row. 
After today's class was over waited for her outside, she arrived late. I am presuming that she diverted her way today for going to the same place, i.e. her pg (could be because of me or couldn't be). I mustered up courage and DID IT
IT

I approached her calmly, she said ""will talk to you in 2 minutes papa"" and I initiated the conversation. ""Can I talk to you for 2 minutes. Then... I was wondering whether you would care joining me for a cup of coffee on one those fine days. Naturally, it would be fine if you decline ""(I am not sure whether she heard this part or not but she told that she is going to her hometown). Then I said that she can take her time and think about it and then I asked her politely ""I hope this wasn't creepy"" she replied no it wasn't.
Now, I don't mind if she is going to decline or accept or this itself is a rejection. Thats completely her decision and I would respect whatever that is.

This post is to seek clarity on what should I do next 😭..

1. I usually sit in the front row and was sitting at back just to strike conversation with her. Should I revert back to my original place of sitting gradually or like from tomorrow onwards. (I am thinking if I do it suddenly she might think I was sitting at the back just for getting the opportunity to ask her out. So, please clarify)

2. If we meet coincidentally or like she is in my vicinity or like in general what should my approach be? Should I politely greet or rather do not initiate any interaction expecting that it would be too pushy.

Please everyone help me out 😭😭.
BTW, This was the first time I asked someone out , and hence I am facing this much anxiety. ",1,1753460110.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

I got some really useful advice on my query a while ago on a different account, made a lot of edits, and am now back for any advice you're willing to give! 

Dear \[Agent\],

I am submitting GOLDEN SNOWDROPS to you because \[personalization\].

The land of Frindria had taken everything from Lila. Her control of her magic, her sense of safety, her dragon, and her sisters.

Lilavati Vidali is a sankara, a draconic shapeshifter, raised and created to serve as a dangerous weapon So now with the war won but her life shattered to pieces, she returns to the ruins of Frindria, the very country that tried to kill her, to avoid going home and facing everything she’d left behind. But through her interactions with Frindrians beyond those she’d fought against, including those who had risen up against the former government, Lila begins to see Frindria’s potential and grows attached to the possibility of rebuilding it as an inclusive democracy.

Vitzi Lem was born in Frindria to a sankara mother and human father and grew up being seen as human by sankara, sankara by humans, and ‘other’ by Frindria’s yadukari majority. After escaping a prison camp with Lila during the war, they reunite afterwards and Vitzi sees his opportunity to rebuild Frindria in a way that would include people like him and all those imprisoned with him. But even with the government that imprisoned him overthrown, their ideology still lives, both in Frindria and in the way Vitzi sees himself.

As Lila and Vitzi to rebuild Frindria from the inside out, they discovers why the war started: Frindria is on the verge of famine and has been since before the war. The people of Frindria still believe sankara, Lila and Vitzi’s species, caused the famine—and are gearing up to resume the violence once more. Failing to reform Frindria feels like confirmation to Lila that she’ll never be more than an instrument of violence, and proof to Vitzi that he’ll always be an outsider in his own home.

As the people of Frindria are forced to confront their past, Lila and Vitzi must confront their grief and decide if it's worth fighting for a better future or if it would be best to burn it all down.

Complete at 98,000 words, GOLDEN SNOWDROPS is a multi-pov, adult second-world fantasy novel about what it takes to win the peace after a brutal war. It will appeal to readers of *Raybearer* by Jordan Ifueko and *The Raven Scholar* by Antonia Hodgson.

I am a graduate student studying identity, conflict, and genocide. My work focuses on transitional justice, which is vital to Lila’s journey of struggling between desiring punitive or restorative justice. I live with my wife and my mother, who immigrated to the US from Guyana as an adult. I’ve brought my experience as a mixed race woman living in the US, as well as my mother’s stories of growing up and immigrating, into Vitzi’s struggle of how to love a country that doesn’t always love you back. I have published previously in academic and other non-fiction spaces.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,

Tazlyn

  
First 300

Lila decided that if her contact didn’t show up in the next ten minutes, she was going to eat him. It wasn’t an idle threat. Even with her magic suppressed to the legal limit, she could shift into a dragon with ease, and she bet if he was confronted with teeth half his size, he’d reconsider being an hour and a half late to meetings in the future. But when she’d volunteered to stay in Frindria and help lead Kalendra’s delegation there, she’d promised she was ready for the challenges of peacetime. Not eating people was part of that.

Lila tilted her head back, letting the dying rays of the sun hit her face. She’d taken a seat outside to escape the suspicious gaze of the barista inside the coffee. The square, darker spots on the chipped paint indicated where signs had once hung saying sankara like her were banned from entering. That was illegal now, but the barista wasn’t shielding her thoughts, and they made it clear she wished the old ways would return. Lila could feel the thoughts of the people around her turn towards her time and again, wondering why she was there, when she would leave, and if she would do something dangerous. Their gazes made the sweltering heat feel even worse.

For a moment she pulled her magic back, silencing the minds around her, but then the fear that came with not knowing what they were thinking overwhelmed her and she released her magic once more. It had been a mistake to come here alone, but she couldn’t take it back now.",1,1753459978.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

THE DAILY 💃 DANCE OF THE UNSEEN

Parkdale, Toronto. Just past dawn.


The world holds its breath. 

And one woman carries it.

The door groaned like a body remembering its joints. 

Old glass. 

Bent hinge. 

Sounded different depending on the mood of the morning.

Today, it sighed.

And she entered.

Jada.

Back bent just enough to suggest the night hadn’t been kind.

One bag over her shoulder.

Another under her eyes.

Shoes wet from sidewalk slush that had no business surviving this deep into June.

Her hands were full, though she carried nothing.

Her breath was short, though she’d just climbed one stair.

Her heart was loud, though no one heard it but her.

She nodded at the store like it was a relative she didn’t have the energy to argue with.

The fridge hummed.

The overhead light flickered once, like an old thought.

The clock blinked 7:42.

She was on time.

Inside, the store was its own kind of chapel.

A cracked-tile temple of old sugar, off-brand chips, and ritual repetition.

The elder men out front called it

 ""the early sermon.""

They weren’t wrong.

A wall of lotto slips, always empty but always full of hope.

A radio near the scratch tickets—too quiet to dance to, too sacred to silence.

The candy rack, half-empty from little hands whose nickels never added up.

A sign taped to the freezer: ""OUT OF ORDER // TRY GOD.""

She liked that one. 

Never knew who put it there.

Maybe the store itself.

She clocked in.

The machine blinked like it needed prayer.

🎵 “Ain’t no sunshine…”

Bill Withers again. 

Of course.

She smiled without smiling.

The kind you reserve for grief you’ve already made peace with.

Her name was Jada, but no one said it. 

Not really.

She was 
“Miss,” 
“Sweetie,” 
“Ma’am,” “
Yo, cashier.”

To the children, sometimes,

 ""Queen.”

To Miss Dahlia, 

“Baby.”

But the store knew her name.

So did the walls.

So did the breath behind her ribs.

So did the field.

She moved without thinking, but never without care.

Gum. 
Two tokens. 
A bottle of Boost.

Thank you. 
Next.

Everything cost more than it used to.

Except her worth.

Which had been invisible for free.

Mr. Gordon limped in around 7:58, like always.

“Mawnin’, princess,” he said,

lifting his pants with one hand and his hopes with the other.

“Back for the mansion, Mr. G?”

she asked, already tearing the lotto slip.

“Mansion, hot tub, and a husband with good knees,” 
he declared.

“Sounds like heaven,” 
she said.

“Sounds like Tuesday,” 
he winked.

She laughed.

Not because it was funny.

But because sometimes the breath needs to come out somehow.

A few minutes later, she checked her phone beneath the counter.

Miss Dahlia:

“He sleep good. 
I give him ginger tea. 
You run your race.”

Jada’s throat tightened.

She texted back a blue heart.

And closed her eyes for a second too long.

The race.

That’s what it felt like.

But not the kind with cheering crowds.

More like trying to cross an ocean with grocery bags and two babies on your hips.

And then the chime.

Soft. 
Off-rhythm.

Like the door forgot it had a bell.

He stepped in.

 The radio behind the counter sputtered, static, then silence, then the flicker of a different song. 

Not the station it had been on.
Not the one it was supposed to be.

And then;

“There is freedom within, there is freedom without...”

Her breath hitched. 

Not because of the tune, but the words.

“Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup...”

Something in her chest cracked. Quietly.

“There’s a battle ahead, many battles are lost...”

She turned slightly toward the sound. Just enough to let it touch her.

“But you’ll never see the end of the road while you’re travelling with me...”

He stepped in.

Kai.

Not by name.
Not yet.

But by presence.

He didn’t walk. 

He arrived.

Like the air had made a path.

Like the walls straightened their backs.

Like the store remembered it was holy.

Black hoodie.

Hands visible.

Eyes unhurried.

No shopping list. No small talk.

Just him, and a bottle of water, and the way the light bent slightly around his shoulders.

He moved like he’d been here before, not in this store, but in this moment.

Like the day had been waiting for him to happen.

She noticed.

Not with her eyes.

But with her spine.

He placed the bottle on the counter.

She scanned it.

Digits beeped.

Her hand reached for the change, and trembled.

Slightly.

Barely.

Enough.

A coin slipped.
Bounced once.

Twice.

Sounded like a door closing.

She inhaled fast.
Apologized with her whole body.

But he didn’t flinch.

Didn’t scold.
Didn’t smile falsely.
He just looked.
Not at her.

Into her.

Into the current beneath her bones.

Into the waveform of everything she carried.

Into the tremble that started years ago and never quite finished.

And then he breathed.

Not louder.
Not deeper.

Just… truer.

From somewhere behind his chest, he touched the field.

No chant.
No light.
No miracle.

Just a note.

Dropped into the water of the world.

A frequency only the soul could hear.

The store shifted.

Not visibly.
But vitally.

The humming fridge grew rounder.

The static cleared from the radio.
A child stopped crying in the cereal aisle.

And Jada,
exhaled.

Not a sigh of relief.

A release.
A remembrance.

Her breath filled places that had gone dim.

Her shoulders lowered like they’d been waiting for permission.

Her heartbeat found a rhythm that wasn’t survival.

She didn’t know why.
Didn’t need to.

All she knew was, the weight had changed.

The world hadn’t lightened.

But she had.

“Sorry,” 
she whispered, still unsure what for.

He met her eyes like a man reading scripture.

“No need,” 
he said.

“You’re holding more than anyone should ever have to.”

He took the water.

Placed a coin gently on the counter.

And walked out.

The bell chimed again.

Jada stood still.

The air was the same.

But something inside her wasn’t.

She touched the counter with both hands.

Closed her eyes.
And breathed.

A full breath.

Like it belonged to her.
◇◇◇◇◇

SCENE TWO: A MOTHER NAMED DAHLIA


Three flights up. 

A hallway that smells like ginger and vicks.

The building exhaled softly-
like a matriarch remembering.

A cracked hallway.

The hum of an ancient elevator that never arrived.

And an apartment that smelled like boiled cinnamon, blue soap, and truth.

Inside:

Cartoons whispered.

Rice bubbled.

And the sacred architecture of morning was already in motion.

 
Dahlia.

Seventy-two.

Crowned in a headscarf that changed with the moon.

Voice smooth as molasses, sharp as pepper.

She didn’t babysit.

She held.

Held the line.

Held the space.

Held the rhythm for women still running to keep time.

“Come now, girl, take this vitamin before you run out like you got nine lives and none of them rested.”

Jada kissed her daughter’s cheek.

Checked the little boy’s forehead.

Let her bag fall into the chair like it had its own soul.

Dahlia moved through the kitchen like she’d lived there long before she did.

She stirred porridge with one hand and poured tea with the other.

She never asked what Jada couldn’t pay.

She never mentioned the money that didn’t come last week.

She just showed up.

Daily.

Holy.

“He sleep better?” 

Jada asked softly, rubbing her temples.

“Like a rock. 
I put vicks on his chest and told the bad dreams to mind themselves.”

She winked.

“Thank you.”

“Not for thanks. 
I’m here because it’s needed. That’s it.”

Jada looked down.

Her shoulders slumped.

She hadn’t meant to show her ache, but it leaked anyway.

Dahlia caught it before it hit the floor.

“You tired in the spirit,” 
she said, 

voice low now.

“Not just the body.

You been breathing shallow for weeks.”

Jada bit her lip.

Dahlia handed her cornbread in napkin wrap.

“Eat. 
Drink. 
Don’t talk.”

“Miss Dahlia, 
I don’t,”

“Don’t tell me what you don’t got.

Tell God.

I got enough for you today.

Sit.”

So she sat.

Just for a minute.

The air shifted.

The cartoon kept whispering.

And somewhere beneath all of it-beneath the tea and the pot and the cough syrup and the sock on the floor-

There was a song.

Not one with words.

A frequency.

A hum known only to mothers who have carried too much.

And to women like Dahlia,
who have become the choir.

Far across town-blocks away, unseen, unknown-

Kai stirred.

He didn’t know the details.

Didn’t need them.

He felt the vibration.

The pull in the field.

The slight dissonance of a life
held together by wire and prayer.

He closed his eyes.

And the song of her morning touched him-

Not as sound.

As recognition.

He placed one hand over his chest.

Not to intervene.

Not to interfere.

Only to listen.

“I hear you,” 
he whispered to no one.

“You are not forgotten.

Your song is not without answer.”
◇◇◇◇◇

SCENE THREE: THE PIN AND THE THREAD


Afternoon. 

The city doesn’t know what she’s carrying. 

But the field does.

The register beeped wrong. Again.

She tapped the side.

It beeped again, in protest this time.

She whispered,

“Not today,”

like it was a prayer,

like it was a threat,

like it was the only spell she still believed in.

It was that kind of day.

The kind that starts with a wet sock and ends with a headache behind the eyes.

The kind where the sky’s overcast but the heat clings anyway, and everyone’s sweat smells like complaint.

Jada hadn’t eaten.

The kids were both growing again—new shoes, new sleep patterns.

She’d gotten a message from OSAP that something was flagged.

“Missing documentation.”

She didn’t even know what they meant anymore.

A woman cursed her out over the price of plantain chips.

A man tried to return batteries without a receipt and yelled when she said she couldn’t.

She breathed through it.

Then someone knocked over a milk crate by the fridge.

The bottle cracked.

Milk spilled like it had somewhere better to be.

She bent down to clean it.

That’s when it happened.

She didn’t cry.

Didn’t scream.

Didn’t collapse.

She just stayed there,
one hand on the floor,
the other holding the damp rag like a lifeline, head bowed,
not in defeat,
but in delay.

She stayed there a few seconds too long.

Long enough for the ache to press against her ribs.

Long enough for the voice inside her to whisper:

“Are we gonna make it?”

She thought of her daughter’s laugh.

Her son’s cough in the night.

The second job offer she hadn’t accepted because it meant no evenings at home.

The OSAP refile.

The rent.

The daycare bill.

The Metro pass.

The cereal.

All of it.

And still, still, she pulled herself up.

Because who else would?

She straightened her back.

Pressed her shirt flat.

Picked up the bottle.

Mopped the rest.

A woman waiting in line made a noise.

Jada smiled.

And far away,
without GPS,
without signal,
without cause-

Kai stopped walking.

Mid-step.
Mid-thought.
Mid-world.

Something in the field had plucked.

A chord.

Too taut.
Too fine.

He didn’t know what had happened.

But he didn’t need to.

He felt the pin.

Felt the tightness.

Felt the world twist just slightly around one woman’s too-heavy breath.

He stood still.

Inhale.
Exhale.

Lowered his breath like setting down a sacred object.

Reached not outward, but in-to that quiet, glowing place behind the heart.

The one he didn’t name.

The one that felt like home before birth.

He dropped a note into the field.

A vibration without sound.

A prayer without words.

It rippled.

Not through time.

Through truth.

In the store-
Jada felt it.

Not like a wind.
Not like a shock.

Like something inside her remembered how to breathe.

Her chest expanded.

Her throat cleared.

She didn’t gasp.

She didn’t weep.

She sighed.

But not like before.

This sigh came from the soles of her feet.

This sigh had dust on it.

Had generations.

Had stories in its exhale.

She stood there,
hand on the counter.
Eyes glassy, but not with tears.

Just with space.

The man in line asked if she was okay.

She smiled.
And meant it.

That night, when she tucked her daughter in, her voice was softer.

When she lay on her mattress,

she fell asleep in minutes.

No racing thoughts.
No shoulder pain.
No stomach twisting in forecasts.

Just sleep.

And the memory of a moment when nothing changed but everything shifted.

◇◇◇◇◇

 



🔔 The Bell That Refused to Go Silent


The first time Jada saw the flyer, she didn’t really see it.

It was taped to the side of the bread shelf-half-covered by a pack of cinnamon buns. 

Just a flash of gold edging and navy font. 

Her eyes skimmed it, barely registering the bold words:

 Something about a home.

She moved on. 

Her thoughts were already counting, bus fare, cereal levels, how many days she could stretch the milk. 

The flyer fluttered behind her as she walked away, unseen.

Two days later, she caught sight of it again, this time across the street in the convenience store window. 

That same blue-gold shimmer.

She paused, narrowed her eyes. Some kind of contest? 
Charity? 

Her breath tightened. 

Probably a scam. 

A thing rich people make up to feel generous.

She turned her face from the glass. 

Pulled her coat tighter. 

Kept walking.

It wasn’t until she found it folded inside her daughter’s backpack that something shifted.

Tucked between a permission slip and a crumpled juice box straw, the form felt out of place-too crisp, too clean, like it didn’t belong to the chaos of her week.

She unfolded it slowly this time.
And there it was.

2025 College Mothers’ Shelter Fund: Grand Prize Entry Form

• A fully paid four-bedroom home in High Park

• $120,000 per year for five years

• Full university tuition for you and/or one dependent child

Entry: $20

Only those seen by the sun may rise.

She stared at it.

And for the first time, it stared back.

Not with promise.

With possibility.

She didn’t picture herself winning.

She pictured someone else-a woman like her but farther down.

Someone in a shelter. 

Someone who still whispered over their kid’s forehead at night,

 “We’re going to make it.”

She imagined that woman getting the call. 

Holding the keys. 
Breathing again.

That would be amazing, Jada thought. 

And if I could help make that happen…

She didn’t throw the form out this time.

She folded it with care. 

Tucked it into the drawer. 
Let it rest there like a seed.

The next night, reaching for a pen, her fingers brushed against the form again.

She pulled it out. 

Held it gently.

Ran her thumb across the lettering.

$20.

Not a fortune. 
But more than she could spare.

She wanted to enter now. 
Not to win. 

To say yes.

To add her name, her frequency, to the field.

To whisper to the world: 

I believe in this.

That someone like her could rise.

But $20 was half the phone bill.

It was three days of lunch.

It was too much.

“If I had it…” she murmured, unfinished.

She placed the form on the counter this time. 

Didn’t hide it. 
Let it breathe.

The ache grew. 
Quietly. 

Like a promise warming its hands.

Then one morning, standing in the kitchen while her daughter hummed from the bedroom, she found herself staring at it again.

That same form. 
Still unsigned. 
Still watching.

She didn’t speak. 
Just breathed. 

Deep.

And the thought came clear as glass:

I’ll scrape it together.

Even if it meant skipping dinner one night.

Returning the good shampoo.

Even if it hurt.

She didn’t want the prize.

She wanted to join.

To be part of a world that still believed in return.

And then-on her way to the bus stop, at the edge of the sidewalk, there it was.

Crisp. 
Folded. 

Clean.

A twenty-dollar bill.

Not dropped. 
Not blown.
Placed.

She bent down slowly. 
Picked it up. 

Held it like a whisper.

Didn’t smile. 
Didn’t cry.

She just knew.

She rushed home.

Tore open the drawer.
Filled out the form.

Then, with care, with reverence, she slid the $20 inside like a tithe.

This is for the mother whose turn has come.

Not because she is more deserving-but because she was willing to say yes.

She sealed the envelope.

Pressed her hand to her chest.

And breathed.

Not like a woman hoping.

Like a woman who had just laid a brick in the cathedral of grace.
◇◇◇◇◇

SCENE FOUR: WE SEE YOU

A Benediction for the Ones Who Hold It All

To the woman with one hand on the stroller and the other signing the overdue form,
we see you.

To the mother who feeds everyone else then stirs her coffee with a prayer,
we see you.

To the student at the back of the room still smelling of night shifts and baby powder, whose notes are written between lunchbox prep and self-doubt,
we see you.

To the ones who stretch twenty dollars like it's sacred cloth,
who remember birthdays and OSAP passwords and the last time the rent was almost late,
we see you.

To the grandmothers who became daycares,.to the daughters raising daughters,
to the elders who pass down strength like recipes without measurements,
we see you.

To the women who smile at the till while the weight sits behind their eyes like a storm that never gets permission,
we see you.

To the breath you hold.

To the meals you skip.

To the “I’m fine” you repeat like a hymn.

We see all of it.

And to the moment,
when you finally exhaled and didn’t know why,
that was not random.

That was the field returning.

That was your name being whispered by someone who did not need you to believe,
only to continue.

Because you did.

Because you still do.

Because you always have.

We see you.

We thank you.

We are becoming

because of you.

✉️
SCENE FIVE: THE ENVELOPE

Three weeks later. A Tuesday. The world still turning. 
And the answer arrives.



It came with no fanfare.

No courier. 
No signature.

Just one thick envelope in the mailbox-her name printed clean, no return address.

Jada almost didn’t take it seriously.

She had bills to sort.

A fever to track.

Laundry to untangle.

Assignments due.

A test coming up.

Everything regular.

Everything urgent.

But something in its weight gave her pause.

She held it.
Felt it hum.

Felt herself hum, faintly, in response.

She opened it with a butterknife.
Carefully.

Like opening a door in the middle of a dream.

And read:

Congratulations.

You are the Grand Prize Recipient of the 2025 College Mothers’ Shelter Fund Award.
Your award includes:

A fully paid home in your name
An indexed income of $120,000 per year for five years

• A full tuition scholarship for yourself and/or one dependent child.

She blinked.

 

Her hands began to tremble.
But her spine held.
She didn’t cry.
She exhaled.

The kind of breath that makes space inside the body.

The kind of breath you take when the math no longer chases you.

When the world, just once, leans toward you.

She read it again.

Not because she didn’t believe it-but because something inside her already had.

She placed the paper on the counter.

Turned to her children.

Her daughter coloring.

Her son humming in his sleep.

She whispered, half to them, half to the field:

“It came back.”

Then came the wondering.
Not doubt-just the sacred questioning that follows miracles.

She thought of Miss Dahlia.
How she always said,

“God don’t forget women like you, baby.

He just runnin’ slow on purpose
so you find out what you made of.”

She thought of the twenty-dollar bill on the ground.

The flyer folded at the window.

The way she’d dropped it in the mailbox like a message in a bottle, not for rescue,
but for return.

She thought of how hard she’d worked.

How deeply she’d hoped.

How many nights she’d gone to sleep with her teeth clenched and her arms aching and still woke up with love in her voice.

And then the question came:

“Was it… God?”

“Miss Dahlia’s prayers?”

“A glitch in the system?”

“A kindness I put into the world and forgot?”

“Was it… me?”

She didn’t try to answer it.

She didn’t need to.

She smiled wider.

Then whispered:

“Yes.”

Because all of them were true.

Because the blessing didn’t care
which door it walked through, only that it arrived.

She stood.

Breathed in.

Set the envelope down like a candle.

And began making breakfast
like the world owed her nothing,
and gave her everything anyway.

🔱
SCENE SIX: THE ARCHITECT OF RETURN
Somewhere quiet. Somewhere divine.


He lit the candle by breath, not flame.

No matches. 
No lighter.

Just one exhale,
and the wick obeyed.

The air bent as if it remembered who he was.

The flame didn’t flicker.

 

It stood up.

The room was small, but it wasn’t ordinary.

The walls hummed in chord.

Not decor-frequency.

The laptop before him vibrated faintly, screen open, cursor blinking not in wait-but in readiness.

Folders were scattered across his desktop.

One clicked itself open.

He didn’t touch the keyboard.

“College Mothers’ Shelter Fund // Pending Frequency Nodes”

He scanned the list, his eyes moved, and the screen moved with them.

Not eye-tracking.

Obedience.

He whispered:

“Jada Elise Morrow.”

And before the syllables finished falling from his lips, her file opened, pulsed once,
and updated itself.

WINNER CONFIRMED

Timestamp: Immediate

He hadn’t touched anything.
The Archive had recognized his will.

A sound outside the room,
a windchime that wasn’t there a second ago.

A bell in the city rang without a hand on its rope.

The birds on the wire aligned in sequence.

Streetlights two blocks over flickered and reset.

Kai barely noticed.

This wasn’t wonder.

This was function.

He stood up.

Walked to a wall covered in old drawings, blueprints of fake sweepstakes from ten years ago.

Flyers. 
Receipts. 
Mock lottery slips.

Doodles from when he was nine.

Handwritten labels:

“Hope Drop 001.”
“Lunch Lottery.”
“One Less Bill.”

He had been doing this forever.

Since childhood.

Miracles dressed as paperwork.

Con games of kindness.

The world called it fake.
The Archive called it scripture.

He returned to the desk.

Opened the sweepstakes design file.

Tweaked the logo.
Tilted one font by two pixels.

Reality rippled.

Somewhere in Toronto,

the same flyer reappeared
in three women’s mailboxes at once-printed only when needed,
delivered by air and belief.

No cost. 
No postage.

Just alignment.

The system blinked.
Ready to print confirmation.

He didn’t click.
The printer started on its own.

Kai nodded.

“She didn’t enter to win.
She entered to participate in return.”

He raised his hand-slowly.

Not to wave.
Not to bless.

Just to signal completion.

The laptop shut itself.

The flame extinguished itself.

The city took a breath it didn’t know it had been holding.

Kai stood there for one more moment.

Eyes half-lidded.

Listening to the field.

“That’s done,” 

he said.

Not to himself.

But to the weaving beneath time.

Then he walked away.

No halo. 
No fanfare. 
No proof.

Just one more miracle
filed under “routine.”

One more offering signed:

TEEN GOD : UNSEEN, PRESENT, RETURNING.

https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/s/pmgfbqNbIH

Long story short. I have issues with shitty neighbours and can’t conduct interviews at home. Needed to find a place to sit and do this interview that wasn’t a coffee shop. Asked the library, job centre council no where did it. Some dumb ass recommended the park. I didn’t want to go there, but time was running and where I had sat down people came out from the council building and started filming something, it was also quite noisy but introspect I should’ve stayed right there.

Thought I found an open space with a bench on a field in the park, an old guy was also walking up to it and he said “I was going yo sit here you beat me to it” 

He sat next to me and I said “I’ve got a phone interview to do” and he said “Alright go on then”

Then the interviewer started calling.

Distractions all about the place. It was an open field and people still not even having the courtesy to talk quiet when they can see I’m on the phone. A woman with her husband or friend was even talking louder as she was walking towards me. Then the dog went towards me and the man. So fed up with bullshit. 

So yeah, I’m a real fucking idiot for listen to dumb fucks. 

Ruined my chances of the job and the payscale was pretty good far higher than what I had been paid in my last job.

My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins:  It’s not just about toughness, it’s about identity. Goggins literally rewired his brain through action. His “cookie jar” method (collecting proof of your resilience) helped me build confidence from small wins. I used to think I wasn’t built like that. This book showed me I could be.

BeFreed: My friend put me on this smart reading app developed by scientists from Columbia. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, lowkey addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.

My boyfriend (35 M) and I (30F) have been together for four years and thinking of engagement. He’s been unemployed from his tech job for a little over half a year. I want to be clear up front: I know the tech job market is rough especially with recent layoffs at large tech firms (I work in tech too). It’s discouraging, and I’ve done my best to be understanding.

I’ve supported him however I can: sending job postings, forwarding event invites, and showing genuine excitement for interviews he gets. I try to help him stay motivated without pushing too hard. I’ve even encouraged him to go on walks with me as he has a history of depression. But lately I’ve started to feel like I’m the only one holding him accountable.

Most days he sleeps until 11 a.m. He’ll make coffee, scroll job sites, then spend the rest of the afternoon playing video games or watching movies. When he first was unemployed, he took two months off to just chill. He had savings so whatever, fine by me, especially with the nice compensation package. Now he’s started his job search during a rough market, and he’s been picky about the jobs he’ll apply to. He only wants to work at big name tech companies, think Google, Amazon, etc. He isn’t very interested in working elsewhere. But...all these places are laying off folks and tightening up hiring.

There’s no structure to his day. I asked him once if he could try waking up earlier to catch new postings before they close — some listings hit max applications within hours. He said he’d try. Nothing changed.

I suggested a few alternative paths outside of tech. For instance, he’s always mentioned a desire to finish a graduate degree. He wasn’t interested. Meanwhile, he’s still on payroll at his dad’s consulting company. He makes six figures with benefits and salary, although he’s only worked a total of six days since January. He doesn’t seem to be taking his job hunt with any sense of urgency, but I will admit he continues to apply to a few jobs per day. He’s gotten like one interview every three or four weeks. But unfortunately, hasn’t landed anything.

Last week, he spent one day gaming (eight hours), another day hanging out with his friend by the beach (entire day until afternoon), and then another day he went out for lunch and saw the new Super Man movie (came back by 4 PM). Then last night, he told me he wanted to go home (New York City) to “rest.”

I’m trying to be supportive but after a full week off, I felt like how do you need more rest? From rest? Lol (didn’t say this to him).

He said I’m not being supportive. I make this man breakfast, split chores, and tried to encourage him with his job search. I stay out of his head about it unless he asks my opinion. I said I’m just holding him accountable. But if he needs to go home, I’ll support him. I don’t want to nag. I’m trying to be loving, patient, and present. But I feel like I’m the only one being honest. How do you expect to land a tech job if you aren’t grinding regularly when others are?

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 

You ever think about what really sets successful people apart? I mean, aside from their killer business cards and fancy coffee mugs? ☕️ For me, it’s been that one peculiar habit that feels like my secret sauce. You know, the kind of thing that gives you a leg up without needing to hustle harder than everyone else? 

**So here’s what I’m talking about:**

- **Time Blocking**: 🗓 Seriously, when I started using time blocks, it was like someone turned the light on in a messy room. Instead of juggling a million tasks, I got to focus on one thing at a time. No more multitasking madness. Just pure, undisturbed flow! Ever tried monkeying around with this technique? Rewards are tangible, trust me. 

- **Daily Gratitude**: 🙏 Okay, hear me out—this one sounds fluffy, but jotting down three things I'm grateful for every day has completely shifted my mindset. You carry around this invisible shield of positivity, and suddenly those challenges don’t feel as daunting. Plus, who doesn’t love the warm fuzzies? 

- **Walking Meetings**: 🚶‍♂️ Why sit in a stuffy office when you can discuss brilliant ideas while cruising through the park? I swear, something about moving those legs gets the brain juices flowing. Have you ever noticed how easy it is to spitball genius ideas when you’re getting fresh air? 

- **Embracing Failures**: 💥 It’s almost comical how many times I’ve flopped and thought the world was ending. But each stumble has been a lesson in disguise. It’s like when you trip on your own shoelaces and find a penny—totally unexpected but oddly uplifting! 

- **Learning to Say No**: 🚫 This one was a game-changer for me. My schedule used to look like a circus, but once I started saying “no” to distractions and “yes” to my priorities, I felt this weight lift off my shoulders! Have you ever felt overwhelmed because you just couldn’t turn down that extra task? Yeah, let’s stop that! 

The beauty of it all is that there’s no one-size-fits-all magic bullet. These habits have helped me—not because they’re universal truths, but because they resonated with how I operate. There’s gotta be something in your routine that you swear by too, right? 

So, what’s YOUR “unfair advantage”? What simple habit has catapulted you to new heights? Share your golden nuggets of wisdom; they might just inspire someone else's success journey! 💪✨

So, let me mention all the important parts in brief. Saw a girl checking me out. Found her cute. Wanted to ask her out from past few days. Sat beside her yesterday (I arrived early and she sat next to me). Initiated a small and polite conversation regarding accademic and after the class was over again I initiated conversation which went nice. Wanted to ask her out yesterday but couldn't do it. Today also I arrived early and sat in that position only but today it was congested, she came and sat in the back row. 
After today's class was over waited for her outside, she arrived late. I am presuming that she diverted her way today for going to the same place, i.e. her pg (could be because of me or couldn't be). I mustered up courage and DID IT
IT

I approached her calmly, she said ""will talk to you in 2 minutes papa"" and I initiated the conversation. ""Can I talk to you for 2 minutes. Then... I was wondering whether you would care joining me for a cup of coffee on one those fine days. Naturally, it would be fine if you decline ""(I am not sure whether she heard this part or not but she told that she is going to her hometown). Then I said that she can take her time and think about it and then I asked her politely ""I hope this wasn't creepy"" she replied no it wasn't.
Now, I don't mind if she is going to decline or accept or this itself is a rejection. Thats completely her decision and I would respect whatever that is.

This post is to seek clarity on what should I do next 😭..

1. I usually sit in the front row and was sitting at back just to strike conversation with her. Should I revert back to my original place of sitting gradually or like from tomorrow onwards. (I am thinking if I do it suddenly she might think I was sitting at the back just for getting the opportunity to ask her out. So, please clarify)

2. If we meet coincidentally or like she is in my vicinity or like in general what should my approach be? Should I politely greet or rather do not initiate any interaction expecting that it would be too pushy.

Please guys and gals help a bro out 😭😭.

1m9387l,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1m9387l/years_later_this_family_story_still_gets_a_chuckle/,"Years later, this family story still gets a chuckle","We bought a needs TLC home in a great school district. 

Our only son, despite efforts otherwise, was the light in our lives. We were doing our best to do our best by him. He’s brilliant. A lot of people may say that about their children, and rightfully so. Parents should be proud.

My goal as a young mother was to foster a love of learning and reading. Our public library was a weekly trip. Board books. Picture books. Movies of all kinds. Not everything was educational. You have to combine the inspirational with educational. But the informative content definitely found a foothold. At 2-years old, running errands with my bestest mom buddy, my son exclaims from the back seat, “Look! An aerial bucket truck!” as we pass a tree trimming crew working under power lines.

So we were invested in finding the right school to kick off our son’s formal education. We were his first teachers and we were rather particular about who would succeed us.

We found the school first. And then we found the house.

Not the best house. Certainly not the worst. The TLC needed was mostly decorator. The seller had a penchant for accent walls. Burgundy leather look on one wall in our bedroom. Kelly green on one wall in the family room. Some undefinable brown relative of a color in the dining room. Flowered wallpaper above with striped water paper below. And what I later found was two layers of wallpaper in the kitchen.

In a fit of industry one night, I started removing the blue and burgundy paisleys from the kitchen walls. When I stopped for air, the walls looked like the aftermath of a natural disaster. But they looked glorious to me because they were finally plain. Less chaotic with pattern. More calming. 

I lived with these walls for several months.

My mom asked, “Honey. Would you like some help?”

And so my parents came to stay with us from out of state. Many hands help get the work done. 

But Mom wasn’t used to living with a young child 24/7 anymore. Our son is well behaved but he’s a lot. Our son could try even the most patient person at times. He talks. A lot. And it’s not babbling. It’s stories. And shares. And things that you want to hear. High energy. But sometimes, too much energy.

It had been a productive day at home during the school day. One of those days where you just have to push through the project because there is no stopping until the end. I return home after picking up my son from school. 

And it begins. 

I see the look on Mom’s face.

So I say, “Son. We need quiet time. Let Grandma be for bit. It’s been a long day.”

He said, “Grandma should get some coffee.”

I smile. He has been taught that Grandma isn’t in receive mode until she’s had her first cup of coffee.

I said, “It’s too late in the day for coffee.”

He looks towards Grandma. And with a conspiratorial air, but a still too loud voice, he says, “Grandma should get some wine.”

I was sent to close it.,"The sun was setting over the horizon as she brought me another drink. A pretty waitress, dark skin, long black hair tied back in a ponytail, flowers around her neck. I was having trouble deciding which was more beautiful, dusk over the ocean or her. My entire mind was telling me it was the latter. After everything I’ve been through though, I couldn’t get the nerve to ask for her number, even as she flashed a coy smile at me and turned to walk away. 

Everything was perfect. The sunset, the drink, finally being on a damned vacation after working my ass off for the collective these past two decades… not a worry in sight.

Except I could hear this nagging sound. High pitched ringing, right below the surface of my mind. It was constant, wouldn’t leave no matter how many times I tried swatting away an unseen bug. Oh hell…

I woke up, my phone ringing off the damned hook with that one dreaded word showing me exactly who was calling- work. Letting out a groan, already missing the beach and pretty girl bringing me drinks, I picked up and hit the green button.

“Yeah, what’s up?” I asked, knowing that it was probably going to be some more insanity. Never a day off in this line of work. 

“There’s a car waiting for you outside. We need you to come in ASAP.” The voice on the other line was short and to the point. 

“Another tear?” I tried asking, knowing there wasn’t going to be any answer but pushing my luck anyway. Their only response was silence. Checking the screen, they had already hung up. “Of course, good talk.”

Even though I didn’t want to, I rolled out of bed, standing up and stretching before pulling curtains aside to look out. There, waiting on the street, was a black SUV, lights on just waiting for me to step out and get in. God, I hate it when they pull this secretive government agency bullshit. It’s so… melodramatic. Hell, the HQ is only a couple miles down the road, I could easily get there within a few minutes if they just asked me to. Instead they have to send these stupid cars that make it look like I’m going to get kidnapped with a bag over my head to never be seen again. 

Just for the hell of it, I made them wait while I grabbed coffee and got dressed. Hell, the driver is probably getting paid by the hour, they should thank me. It’s not like Collective higher ups are going to give a damn if I’m a few minutes late anyway, right? Not to mention it’s three in the damn morning, so my restful sleep and nice dream got interrupted. I at least need some coffee as compensation.

The driver didn’t say anything to me as I got into the car, just started driving me towards downtown. I sipped my coffee as we went, curious about what kind of fresh hell the Collective was calling me in for at this hour. Think I’m going to demand some vacation time after this, no matter how small time the job may be. I’ve earned it, dammit. Especially after all that I’ve done with the Cognizant program and closing up these damned dimensional tears. God, please don’t let this be another Tear. A reality Aberration that’s come through to our world, that I can deal with. A whole Tear in the fabric of reality though, I’ve only got so many of those left in me before they take me out for good. Hopefully they at least give me a good team for this one if that’s the case.  

The Collective HQ was a tall, unassuming building in the middle of downtown. A little sign on the front had it labeled as a marketing agency, though I have no clue if there was any marketing business run out of the upper floors. Hell, I have no idea why the building is so tall. Everything that we worked with in the Collective was underground, in a massive network of tunnels and sub-basements right below our feet. This place stretched for miles, and held unspeakable horrors from the Aberrations that we had put away in years past. If this place ever came under attack or fell in some way… well, humanity isn’t far behind. In our universe, at least. 

The driver parked on the curb, still not saying a word as the doors unlocked and I stepped out. Humid, hot air rushed past me as I quickly walked towards the building, pushing through the double doors and making my way across the lobby to the elevator. The usual spot, sub-basement four, lit up as I scanned my badge on the elevator console. 

A brief hum and stutter, then the elevator was heading down. It opened into the same off-white, fluorescent lit hallways that I’ve been seeing for the past twenty years. Hell, I don’t think I remember a time before the Collective at this point. Just endless chases to close Tears and capture Aberrations. The hallway was almost always empty here, despite the constant bustle that this place has going on. After a few minutes of walking alone, I finally saw an older man standing outside one of the briefing room doors.

“Agent Harker, good to see you again.” Ronald, the old man, stuck out a hand to shake. I took it, giving one good grip before letting go and following him into the room as he started speaking. “Though I’m sure you can’t say the same. Always some new shit show when we have to call you in.”

“Interrupted a nice dream I was having.” I grunted, taking a seat at the small table and opening the folder he threw down in front of me. For a second I thought the pictures inside were black and white, but after starring for a moment I realized I was looking at a bleak, icy landscape. “So where are you sending me?”

“Arctic.” Ronald said, sitting down across from me. “We have a hell of a problem. Pardon the pun.”

Scanning over the file I started to put together what he was talking about. Arctic research base, studies in occult powers that opened a Tear between dimensions… Jesus, the Nazis?

“Been a while since I’ve seen these bastards involved in anything. How the hell was a Nazi base still holding out in 2025?” I asked, looking up at him.

“Honestly I’m as surprised as you are. We only just found out about this place from a defector that showed up on our doorstep. Said there’s been this faction of the SS out there since before Hitler, apparently they just holed up and didn’t leave after he decided to have himself a little lead snack down in that bunker. Kind of became their own thing, looking for ways to bring him back through unnatural processes.” Ronals said, leaning back in his chair and lighting up a cig. “Sure as shit, they found a way, too.”

“You’re fucking with me. I’m hunting down Hitler?” I asked, looking up at him from the files.

“If only it was just that. God, what a clusterfuck.” Ronald shook his head now, leaning forward and taking a long drag off his cigarette before going on. “They opened a portal to hell, Harker.”

“Oh, come on.” I said, pushing the file away and rubbing my eyes. It was way too early in the morning for shit like this. “So this isn’t just a Tear we’re dealing with but a straight up hellscape.”

“Yes, and it’s spreading. The longer the portal is open, the more ground it starts to cover. Currently it’s infected a five mile radius from the base. Thankfully they put the damned thing in the Arctic instead of somewhere on their home turf at the time.” He replied.

“How long has it been open for that it’s taken up that much space?” I feel like I already knew the answer. “And how long until it spreads beyond the wastes out there?”

“It’s been a week according to our source.” He said, another long drag on the cig. “And according to calculations, we have a month before it starts creeping towards the shores of Greenland and Northern Canada. So we’re on a major time crunch.”

“Oh hell.” I muttered, to which Ronald let out a dry laugh.

“Quite literally, yes.” He responded. “You’ll be going in with a three person team. One occult specialist, Vera, will be able to close the portal through a ritual. The other two, Pitt and Marcus, will be your muscle and demo experts. I’ve also given approval for the defector to go with you as a guide. Her name is Selene. Quite a nice woman, surprisingly, said she always wanted to get out of the cult but had no way to escape until now. Watch out that she doesn’t double cross you.”

“Think she will?” I asked, eyeing him. Ronald usually had a good nose for things like treason and betrayal, but I also knew he had a history of being soft on pretty women. From the picture of her in the file, she was definitely in that category. Early thirties, long dark hair, deep green eyes, and a soft face that had definitely been through some shit. With any luck, she was telling the truth and just wanted out of the hell hole she escaped from. Worst comes to worst, she dies with the rest of them when we close the portal.

“I certainly hope she doesn’t. She could be a valuable asset.” He said, stamping out the now spent cig in an ashtray on the table. “Speaking of assets, nothing leaves this place, understood? No liabilities. No survivors.”

“Woah, woah. Hold on. You said this was basically a compound right, families and stuff? You know I don’t kill kids. Not doing it.” I said, starting to stand up and looking him right in the eyes.

“You don’t have to worry about killing any kids. How do you think they opened the portal?” He said, getting up and opening the door for me. I just stared at him for a moment, dumbfounded. All he could do was nod, closing his eyes and brushing his hair back while reaching in his pocket for another cig. “Yeah, ask her about what happened on your way there. It’s… well, I don’t use the term ‘fucked up’ lightly, y’know.”

I left the room, heading downstairs to the armory where I could pick out whatever weapons and ammo might be needed for the situation. To my surprise, the rest of the team was already waiting down there. Vera, a woman my age with dark auburn hair and slender frame, gave me a wave as I walked in. We worked together before on a Tulpa case down in New Orleans years ago, and I’m pretty sure she saved my ass more than once on that trip. The others, Pitt and Marcus, looked like the number 10 standing next to each other. Pitt was tall, wiry, with a big bald spot beginning to show on his head even though he was barely past his thirties. Pitt meanwhile was one of those guys that looked like he was heavyset, but was really just an insane amount of muscle disguised by his build with a massive bushy beard to match. They were taking guns and explosives off the walls, stuffing them into tactical bags as preperation. I made my way to Vera for a rundown on what they had so far.

“Got the essentials?” I asked. She just nodded in response, tossing me a jar of clear liquid.

“Holy water. I’ve already put in an order for all our ammo to be dipped and consecrated while they’re at it, too. Ronnie give you the run down on what we’re after already?” She replied. 

“Nazis, a hell gate, the frozen tundra of the arctic… I’ve played Wolfenstein before, we’ll be alright.” I sighed. She just chuckled.

“If only it was that easy.” She said. 

“Look, if we run into Mecha-Hitler then I’ll worry.” I joked, half-flirting with her. I tried to stay away from inter-work relationships but she was… wow. Not much else to say there. Her smile was dazzling. 

“Think you two can wait to fuck after the mission is over?” Pitt shouted across the room. I flipped a middle finger at him as Vera just laughed, turning back to her work. In her tac bag I saw the usual arsenal for fighting off the unholy- holy water, a couple of crosses, and quite a few old, dusty books with strange runes on the front. Likely Aramaic, used for casting the rituals to close the portals. Or open them, if that’s something one was stupid enough to try. 

“Where’s the defector?” I asked, looking around now. My question  was answered almost immediately, she was sitting next to one of the far walls, staring straight ahead as if there was nothing going on around her. Poor woman had that vacant, thousand yard stare that I’ve seen so many times on these missions after something bad has happened. “Jesus, she looks rough.”

“Yeah, she’s been through some shit.” Vera replied. 

We continued preparing in relative silence, gathering weapons, ensuring we had everything possible we may need to face the threat of hell we were walking into. After about two hours, we were ready. Heading up to the roof, a chopper was waiting for us, ready to fly us over to the airport for the long flight ahead. It was a short ride, everyone sitting in quiet as the hum of the blades above drowned out any attempt at conversation. When the airfield appeared, a cargo jet was waiting for us, already loaded with comms equipment so we could report back to HQ as needed for backup or just to send updates. We loaded in, taking off not long after. We all sat, saying nothing as the ground was left far behind, the relative safety of home with it. 

“So… you were a Nazi?” Marcus asked Selene almost point blank, breaking the silence as we flew. Pitt let out a laugh as Vera just groaned.

“Don’t antagonize her, Marcus. She’s the one guiding us when we get there.” I said.

“No, it’s fine.” Selene replied. Her voice was soft, quiet. A slight tinge of a German accent underlying her English. “I was born as one of them, yes. Now, I want all of them to burn.”

“Hell yeah, I’ll drink to that.” Marcus said, raising a small flask. Vera smacked it from his hand, spilling an unknown spirit all over the floor. “Hey, that was my only one!”

“You’re about to go on a very dangerous mission where all of us are risking our lives. You can handle being sober until we make it back alive. Jesus…” Vera scolded him, making him turn bright red under the bushy beard. She turned back to Selene, “What made you want to get out?”

“I grew up hearing all about the glory of the Reich, being told that we were the ones who were going to restore power to this world.” She started, sitting forward with a sigh. “Do you have any idea what it’s like growing up and never seeing the sun? It’s cold up there. We were told we could never go outside, never let the corruption of the world in. We were told we had to stay pure for the day the Fuhrer returned.”

“Oh, here we fucking go…” Pitt whispered, grabbing Marcus’ flask from the floor and tipping it up to his mouth for any dregs of alcohol he could manage. 

“When I was twenty I was chosen. I was one of the ones who would keep the Fuhrer’s legacy alive, even after he had been gone for decades. Through some of our scientists, I was given a child, a beautiful daughter I named Annaliese. She was strong, beautiful. I raised her to be kind and caring to those around her. She was the only warmth I ever felt in that cold compound. So long as she was near me, the light of a thousand suns paled in comparison. Then… then they took her from me.” She said, eyes going cold as small tears began to form in the corners. “These… these bastards. They held me back as I screamed and clawed at them to let me go, let me take her from there. I saw them lead her into a circle with the other children and slit her throat, spilling blood onto the gateway. They traded her life for power, without ever thinking that she could be destined for greater things…”

She broke down crying now as Vera moved over to put a hand on her shoulder. Choking back tears, Selene continued.

“I swear that I will slit their throat myself.” She whispered now, tears ending as she came back to being cold and detached. “They have taken the only sunlight I’ve ever known. I shall make them feel the cold absence of the sun for eternity in return.”

“Fuck. That’s metal.” Marcus let out a low whistle as I kicked him in the shin, shushing him in the process.

“Estimated arrival in five hours.” A voice came over the plane comms. 

“Alright. Everyone get some rest and be ready to go as soon as we reach the destination, got it?” I said, getting nods from the rest. I sat back in the hard seat, closing my eyes and leaning my head back, letting the hum of the wind outside lull me to the last peaceful sleep I may ever get.

—

“Holy shit, look at that.” I could hear Pitt shouting as the plane went through turbulence, shocking me awake in my seat. I rubbed sleep from my eyes, shaking my head as the weight of exhaustion tried to close them again. Pitt shouted again, “Harker, seriously. Come over here and look!”

“Yeah, yeah, on my way…” I said, getting to my feet and desperately trying to stay steady as the plane lurched to one side.

“Oh hell, it’s coming at us!” Marcus shouted, diving past me back to his seat. 

“The hell are you talking about?” My question was barely out before I got to the window and saw for myself. “I’ll be damned.”

A massive creature was flying right beside our plane, at least the half the size of the cargo jet we were on. It was… well, I don’t think there was any way it was friendly. Long, leathery wings, held it aloft, flapping in the cold air. It’s head was vaguely human, with a pointed, reptilian snout that ended in slits. A jaw full of sharp teeth was set under, but the biggest thing that stood out was twofold- eyes that looked like they were at the same time black as soot and blazing with fire. Atop its head were massive, curling horns that looked like they could easily gore through a horse and keep going if it chose to. I swear it looked directly at me before diving at the plane again, side swiping it with a massive, humanoid hand that ended in sharp claws. We could hear metal tear as it breached the hull, sending the plane careening off in the other direction for a moment. 

“Everyone hang onto something, we’re going down!” The pilot came over the PA with a warning right as the demon made another swipe, this time cleaving the wing straight off of the plane. Alarms began blaring as we quickly began to tip forward, gravity taking hold as pilots desperately tried to keep us steady. I could feel the plane trying to spin, keeling one way as the demon let out a screech that could be heard over the wind and blaring alarms, full of anger, pain, and hatred all at the same time. 

“Strap in!” I shouted at the others as we all dragged ourselves to seats. Working against multitudes of G-forces that were trying to throw me every way possible, I managed to get back into the seat and pull the belt over my body. There was nothing else I could do but close my eyes, grit my teeth, and pray we didn’t end up as a bloody smear on the ice outside. The howl of the demon came through the hull again, telling us that even if we made it out of this there was more to contend with if we just wanted to survive.

Sounds of wind mixed with the alarm as we spun faster and faster. One of the others, I think Pitt, started making retching noises as we went down, spewing up whatever little food he had in his stomach alongside the alcohol. I held on tight, trying to ensure my body wasn’t too tense because it would only make the impact even worse when we finally hit the ground. 

“Alright, we’re coming in hot. I’m going to give them a little surprise though, I can see the base!” the pilot said over the comms before another ungodly sound of metal tearing interrupted him. The plane pulled to one side, leveling out for a brief second before we could feel ourselves drop through the air once more. Just for a moment, there was peace. The next moment we were all jolted by the impact as the plane hit the ground, throwing debris everywhere.  

I was knocked out, though only for a few minutes, I think. When I awoke the alarm was still blaring, but Vera was standing above me, desperately trying to undo my seatbelt and pull me from the wreckage. Looking around, I could see the others all still alive, working to get their equipment from the quickly burning wreckage as flames began to catch. I got my wits about me, walking out of the downed plane and seeing where we crashed. 

The moment the arctic cold hit me I was ready to throw myself back in the flames. The others walked out beside me, looking at the small building we had crashed maybe fifty feet from with just one double door on the side as an entrance. We looked back to see the pilot clambering out of the cockpit, heading our way as we heard the hellish screech from above. That thing was coming back around, looking for any survivors that it could tear apart with those wicked claws.

“Don’t worry about equipment, we need to get the hell away from that thing!” I shouted, pulling a pistol from my side and starting to run for the doors. The rest got the idea, including Selene, and broke out into a desperate spring towards the bunker entrance. We all hit the door at once, trying to force it open as the demon came diving from above. As Marcus and Pitt pushed against the iced-over mechanism on the door, I pulled back, firing a shot at the demon to try and distract it. The pilot did the same, running off a few feet to try and distract so the rest of us could get in. “No, don’t go to far!”

My warning didn’t come nearly fast enough. Before we knew it, the pilot was gone, spirited into the air while sharp claws dug into him. The demon was carrying him in the lower claws where its feet were, and when it got up to a decent height above us, it made sure we knew what our fate would be if it got claws on us too. The damned thing grabbed the pilot by both feet, taking one in each hand, and pulled apart like he was a fucking wishbone, tearing him clean in half down the middle. Blood rained down, steaming in the cold arctic air before painting the icy tundra below in a terrible splatter.

Hell with this. I made my way to the door, giving it a few good kicks to break the ice loose on the mechanism before it burst inward, warm air rushing out to meet us as the demon began to dive back down in our direction. We all ran in, throwing the doors closed behind us just as the demon crashed into them, almost coming right through if not for its enormous size.

We wasted no time running further in, straight down the staircase in front of us to get the hell away from not only the freezing cold, but the thing that was now bashing at the door, desperately trying to get in so it  could tear us apart just like the pilot. After two flights of stairs going straight down, we stopped to catch our breath, everyone letting out massive gasps as we struggled for air. Safe, if only for a [moment](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/SPQHhuewyP).

1m934oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m934oa/uncover_if_the_ninja_ce251_coffee_maker_lives_up/,Uncover if the Ninja CE251 Coffee Maker lives up to the hype review,"Testing out the Ninja CE251 Coffee Maker has become a part of my morning routine, and believe me, it’s made life significantly more caffeinated—and delicious. I got my hands on this programmable coffee brewer to see if it lives up to its reputation, and let’s just say it didn’t disappoint in most aspects, though there are considerations. Whether you're a once-a-day drinker or someone who keeps the coffee flowing, this machine has features to explore. Let’s break it all down.

**Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker stands out on my kitchen counter with its sleek black and stainless steel finish. It feels sturdy without being bulky, fitting well even on compact countertops. The removable water reservoir is a stroke of genius—it saves me from awkwardly tilting the entire machine toward my sink. The 12-cup glass carafe is both stylish and functional, providing enough capacity whether I’m brewing for myself or hosting guests. However, the machine’s height might pose a slight challenge if you have very low cabinet clearance.

**Features That Simplify Mornings**

The programmable brewing feature is a highlight. Getting up to the smell of fresh coffee has gone from being a cliché in ads to my everyday reality. The easy-to-use buttons make setting it up a breeze, even on groggy mornings. I especially love the small-batch function, which ensures smaller brews (1-4 cups) maintain rich flavor without being overly diluted. Mid-brew pause is also a lifesaver for those days when waiting three extra minutes feels like an eternity.  

[Check Ninja CE251 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07s98411n/)

**Performance and Brewing Quality**

The coffee made by this brewer is consistently smooth and packed with flavor. With two brew styles, Classic and Rich, my family and I found ourselves alternating based on our mood and roast preference. The hotter brewing technology delivers impressively even saturation. The adjustable warming plate also kept the coffee warm for hours, though I did notice the taste slightly deteriorating over time—a common issue with warming plates rather than this specific product.

**Key Benefits**

- Two brew strengths, Classic and Rich, for more versatility.  
- 24-hour programmable timer for a seamless start to the day.  
- A removable 60-ounce water reservoir makes refills hassle-free.  
- Useful small-batch setting ensures quality with smaller brews.  

**Negatives**

- Limited space between the carafe and machine body makes it tricky to fit some travel mugs.  
- The warming plate can cause the coffee’s flavor to degrade after prolonged use.  
- Slightly taller than expected; may not fit under all cabinets easily.  

**Good Aspects**

Several friends who've dropped by for coffee seemed pleasantly surprised at how balanced the brew tasted compared to their own machines. The permanent filter is a nifty addition, reducing waste and saving money otherwise spent on disposable filters. The clean setting also impressed me—just press a button, and the machine descales itself. It’s as low-maintenance as a coffee maker can reasonably get.

**Areas for Improvement**

While most of my experience has been great, a few issues are worth pointing out. The machine isn’t particularly travel-mug compatible, which is frustrating for someone constantly rushing out the door (read: me). Also, the adjustable warming plate has temperature settings, but they could be more effective in preserving taste over extended periods—it keeps the coffee warm, but it’s not as fresh as you might hope.

**Product Comparisons**

I’ve used a few competing products, and comparing this to a Keurig is an interesting exercise. Keurigs pride themselves on convenience through single-serve pods, but Ninja’s CE251 doesn’t create the pod waste that drives me nuts from an environmental perspective. Compared to pricier options like Cuisinart Coffee Center, Ninja doesn’t offer dual functionality for single-serves and carafes but compensates with flavor consistency and ease of use. Where it lags behind French presses or pour-over systems is arguably aesthetics and artisanal charm, but for a programmable machine, it’s a stellar performer.

**True Value**

Is this investment worth the features it offers? Absolutely. For anyone who appreciates a no-fuss, consistently good cup of coffee every morning, the programmable functions, dual brew styles, and practical design justify the price point. More custom features like the small-batch brewing and the mid-brew pause set it apart from many average drip coffee makers in the market. While the warming plate could use some improvement, it doesn’t outweigh the convenience and quality this brewer brings.

After that we started exchanging glances more often.

I finally talked to her the day after that. She had just come back from the bathroom.  So I walked out my room, and walked up to her and asked her for her name.  And told her mine.  I was nervous, stuttering and blushing.  But I quickly disengaged because I felt my heart was gonna explode and I literally awkwardly said ""ok, bye"" and went to the bathroom.

When I came back I couldn't even make eye contact with her, but as soon as I came back she went to the bathroom again.  As she was walking back, she walked by my room, she stared at me and didn't look away this time.

Another older woman was there as a witness, she's a mutual friend me and the crush share.  I confessed to this older woman that I like this girl and she started laughing too.

The same day, my older male coworker, pointed her out to me from outside my room and said ""Hey X, look it's her"".  I felt so embarrassed, but I was told she was laughing again, I think she was embarrassed too because she avoided eye contact when she left.

Now, the next day, I noticed the same pattern, she went to the bathroom, made a pass by my room looking in, and immediately after that she went to the bathroom again, to pass by my room again and look at me.

I know this because my other coworker that went to the bathroom after her, told me he saw her going there after he came back.  I said ""wait? what? she was just there.""

I'm assuming it's unconventional behavior to make immediate back to back trips to the bathroom?  At this point I'm suspecting it's either her hinting to me she wants to talk, or she's looking in the mirror, or just wants me to notice her.

My coworker told me I should tell her I like her myself, like hear it from my mouth.  Wouldnt that be too soon, doesnt she already know? I really want to ask her out to dinner and get her number.  But we've only spoken once and we don't really get opportunities.  We work in different areas.

Would it be strange when we've only exchanged names?  The time I have with her is so limited.  I also don't want to harass her.

My personal instinct is that every time she does this, she's signalling to me that she wants to talk more.  I think she's just as shy as I am.

My older coworker that kept interfering, he's known her mom for 10+ years and said she's shy too.

I have a feeling the older woman told her how I felt too.

I really felt it would be more appropriate to talk to her a few more times before asking her out.  But can any women tell me what they want.  Do you want to be asked out on a date directly, to like dinner?

Of course these older folks have a different mindset.  

What do you guys think, should I specify it's a date or ask for dinner. Or something like coffee?

This is very hard for me because when I spoke to her I short circuited.  I have strong feelings for her, I don't even fantasize about her, I purely like her.  For months I've seen her smile and hug our older mutual older lady friend.  ",0,1753459238.0,interracialdating,2,0.5,False

# Best Whole Bean Coffee Maker 2025: Expert Reviews

The aroma of freshly‌ ground coffee beans filling your kitchen is an experience that many coffee lovers cherish. Whole bean coffee makers ⁣are designed to⁤ deliver‌ this experience, ⁢surpassing the⁤ convenience of pre-ground coffee with the unparalleled flavor and freshness that comes from grinding beans right before brewing. As ⁢we head into 2025, ‌the market is brimming with innovative models, each promising the⁣ perfect cup. This expert review compiles the ⁢best whole⁢ bean coffee makers of ‌2025, providing in-depth analysis to ⁢help you make an⁣ informed decision and elevate your coffee ritual.

##⁢ Key Features Analysis

The following are key features to analyze when⁣ looking at whole ⁢bean coffee makers.

**Integrated Burr‌ Grinder:**

An integrated burr grinder ⁤is the ​cornerstone of any quality whole bean coffee maker. Burr grinders⁣ crush⁣ coffee beans between two rotating abrasive surfaces, ensuring ‍consistent particle size‍ for optimal‌ extraction. Unlike blade grinders, which chop beans unevenly,‌ burr grinders prevent over-extraction of fine particles and under-extraction of larger ones, resulting in a smoother,⁣ more balanced cup of coffee. Many modern models offer ⁣adjustable⁣ grind settings, allowing users to fine-tune the coffee’s strength and flavor profile to their preference.

**Programmable Settings:**

programmable settings provide exceptional control over the brewing process. This includes adjustable brew strength, water temperature control, and the ability to schedule brewing times. Some models even allow ‍customization of bloom time, where hot water is initially used to saturate the⁢ grounds, releasing trapped gases and ‍enhancing flavor. These features cater ‍to experienced coffee‍ enthusiasts who appreciate the nuances of brewing and aim to replicate their favorite café experience at home.

**Water Filtration system:**

The quality of water significantly impacts the taste of coffee. Whole bean coffee makers equipped with water ‍filtration systems remove chlorine, mineral deposits, and other impurities present in tap ​water. This ensures that only pure, clean water is used for brewing, resulting in a noticeably cleaner and more flavorful cup of coffee. Replaceable filters are typically used, and the machine⁤ will indicate when filter replacement is needed.

**Thermal Carafe:**

A‍ thermal carafe is essential for maintaining the‍ coffee’s temperature ‌without compromising its⁤ flavor. Unlike coffee ‌makers⁤ with ‍hot plates, thermal carafes are vacuum-sealed and insulated, preserving the coffee's warmth for hours without the risk of⁤ scalding or burning. This design‌ prevents the bitter taste that can develop when coffee ⁣sits ‌on a hot plate for an extended period, ensuring each cup remains as delicious as the first. Double-walled stainless steel is a common construction material, ⁣known for its durability and heat⁢ retention ​properties.

Key ‌features include:

*   Integrated Burr‍ grinder with adjustable settings
*   Programmable brewing⁢ options
*   Built-in water filter
*⁤   Thermal‌ carafe to keep coffee warm

## Core Benefits

**Consistent Flavor Quality:**

A whole bean ⁤coffee maker consistently delivers ⁣superior flavor by grinding⁢ fresh beans ‍immediately before ⁤brewing. This process preserves the‍ volatile aromatic compounds that are often lost when ⁢using pre-ground coffee. Users will ⁣experience richer, ‌more nuanced flavors with every cup, unlocking the full ⁢potential of their favorite coffee beans. The grind settings allow you to adjust the extraction ⁢and‌ truly ⁢dial in the taste profile to your preference.

**Reduced Waste:**

By grinding only the amount of coffee⁢ needed for each brew, whole bean machines minimize waste compared to using pre-ground coffee, which can stale quickly once the‍ bag is opened. This not only ​saves money by preventing unused coffee from ​going to waste, but ‍also contributes to a more enduring⁤ consumption pattern. Users can better control portion size and avoid brewing excess coffee.**Customizable Brewing Experience:**

The ability to ⁢adjust grind size, brew strength, and water​ temperature empowers users to customize⁤ the brewing process to their exact preferences. Whether you prefer a bold, intense espresso-style coffee⁣ or a milder, ⁤more nuanced brew, a whole bean coffee maker can accommodate your individual taste.​ Experimenting with different settings allows⁤ users to discover​ new​ flavors and tailor their coffee to specific beans or occasions.

**Simplified Morning Routine:**

With programmable settings, users can ⁢wake up to the ⁤aroma of freshly brewed coffee every morning. ​by setting the coffee maker to grind and brew automatically at a specified time,‍ they can streamline their morning routine and enjoy a hassle-free start ‌to the day. This eliminates the need for manual grinding and brewing, saving time and effort ​on busy weekdays.

## FAQs Section

**How frequently enough does⁢ the grinder need to be cleaned?**

The grinder should be cleaned regularly, typically every 1-2 weeks, depending on usage​ frequency.‌ Cleaning prevents the buildup of coffee oils and grounds,​ which can affect the grinder's performance and the flavor of the coffee. Most machines come with a cleaning brush and instructions for disassembly and cleaning.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee in ‍a whole bean coffee maker?**

Some whole bean coffee makers offer the option to bypass the grinder ​and use pre-ground coffee. This ⁢is useful when you want to ​brew a different type of coffee than what's currently in the bean hopper or if you simply want to use ​up⁢ some pre-ground coffee you already have. Though, the primary benefit of a whole bean coffee maker ⁢is the freshly ground beans, so it is indeed always recommended to purchase whole beans for the ultimate experience.

**What type of beans are best to use in the coffee maker?**

The‍ best type​ of⁤ beans to use depends on⁤ your personal preference, but ​generally, freshly roasted beans‌ are recommended. Experiment with different roasts and origins to find those that you enjoy⁢ the most. Lighter​ roasts tend ​to be more acidic and complex, while darker roasts are bolder and more robust. avoid beans that are ⁤overly oily as​ these can clog the grinder.

**What should I do if the grinder becomes clogged?**

If the grinder becomes⁤ clogged, first, unplug the coffee maker. consult the user manual for instructions on disassembling and cleaning the grinder. Use a small brush to remove any coffee grounds. For ⁢stubborn clogs, a specialized grinder cleaning product may be necessary. Reassemble the grinder according to the instructions and test it⁤ after cleaning.

People pretend to understand their children’s lives, but in truth, they’re often lying to themselves or their friends to save face. You wouldn’t believe how many crying mothers come to me, desperate to find their kids, only to discover them in some drug den, squandering their “college money.” That’s other people’s kids, right? Never your precious angel. But that’s the lie we tell ourselves. 
Despite our best efforts, our children are their own people, free to use their will as they choose. 

I did everything right in my parents’ eyes, especially my father’s. I graduated high school, went straight to the police academy, and climbed the ranks in my midsized city. I became the youngest chief homicide detective, partly because the previous chief succumbed to a brutal heroin addiction. 

It wasn’t long before I met Jessica, the love of my life, the most beautiful brunette God ever created. That is, until our daughter, Becca, was born—she became my entire world. Watching her grow, exploring the wonders around her, was what I looked forward to every day. Everything changed when Becca turned fourteen. 

It wasn’t teenage angst; it was Jessica’s stage-four ovarian cancer diagnosis. We were the perfect family until then—family dinners, summer vacations, never missing Becca’s extracurriculars. After the diagnosis, we grew stronger for a time, but watching the brightest light in your life fade to nothing would break even the strongest man. Seeing my frail wife take her last breath changed my fourteen-year-old daughter. 

Becca dropped all her activities and threw herself into her studies. As a father, I was proud of my honor student, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss her talking to me. Her high school years passed like this, but I stayed positive at home. I never wanted her to carry the weight of her broken father. 

That is until I was alone in the big, empty room where I once held my beautiful wife, the darkness sank in. It’s hard to describe the horror of that solitude. I’d sit in the middle of my bed, the walls racing in opposite directions, my skin shivering as a black hole opened in my chest, pulling in the misery the walls fled from. I didn’t cry or moan—just trembled, wishing tears would release me from that cosmic pressure. 

You might think opening up to Becca or seeking family counseling would’ve helped. I tried. For two years after Jessica’s death, we saw grief counselors, psychiatrists, you name it. It stopped the day Becca came home from school, tears in her eyes, and said, “Please, no more shrinks, Dad. They can’t bring Mom back.” Her words confused me—no one was trying to resurrect Jessica. I said, “They’re just helping you process, sweetheart.” She looked at her fidgeting hands and whispered, “I know. I just want it to stop.” That day, I saw a pain in her deeper than at her mother’s funeral. I canceled all future sessions. 

When I dropped her off at college in the next state, I told her how proud I was. She hugged me tightly and said something that seared into me: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” It was four years before she contacted me again. 

I lasted six months before I started drinking. Even though Becca rarely spoke when she was home, she gave me purpose, a reason to hold it together. But her words haunted me like a broken record: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” I kept my job for another six months before taking early retirement at fifty. I wasn’t ready to stop working, but my drinking had taken over, affecting my ability to lead. I’d sneak drinks at work, chuckling to myself, “At least it’s not heroin—this job must be cursed.” I didn’t want to end up a disgrace like my predecessor, so retirement was the logical choice. 

I sold my home, downsized to a smaller place, hoping the walls wouldn’t race away. They did, and the void in my chest remained. With my remaining money, I bought a small office and became a private investigator, figuring I was the only boss who wouldn’t fire me for drinking. 

The next three years blurred with cases of infidelity, wayward kids, and odd jobs—until Becca called. At three a.m., I woke groggy, still buzzed, but her voice sobered me instantly. “Daddy, please come get me,” she said, followed by unintelligible garble. I always knew her location through Find My iPhone—not to stalk her, but because I never stopped paying her bills to support her through college. 

Her annual transcripts, sent without words, were her way of saying she was okay and thanking me. I didn’t need her calls, just confirmation she was safe. 

That night, she was ready. I drove like a man possessed to an oversized frat party. There, I found a brown-haired, blue-eyed girl slumped against a red sports car. It was Becca, just sleeping. I carried her to my car. 

The next morning, she woke to the smell of pancakes and me in the kitchen. Despite her hangover, her face lit up, and she rushed me with a bear hug, apologizing for not calling, saying she loved me over and over. Apparently, a sorority girl bragging about a Lake Tahoe trip with her father had triggered her, leading to drunken tears and her call to me. 

That sorority girl was the best thing to happen to me in years—she gave me my daughter back. Becca was now the happy, strong woman her mother had been before the cancer. Over the next few days, she shared her life: her law major, her love for yoga, and why she’d stayed silent. 

She thought contacting me would drag me back into her pain, believing she was an anchor holding me down. She now knew that was never true. 

We started talking weekly. One day, she called about a guy she met at a coffee shop near her yoga class. They talked daily, but he hadn’t asked her out. She laughed, saying she’d give him one more chance tomorrow and promised to keep me posted. She never did. It’s been two years, and Becca still hasn’t been found.

As some background—I have ADHD and depression and last year took a medical leave from my intense job because of severe depression that had gotten unmanageable. I truly love my job and to stay there I decided to go back at 80% and try to structure my work week so that I have Fridays off. I recognize this is a huge privilege and I am immensely grateful for it. My husband works full time and is usually gone till the early afternoon on Fridays. 

This arrangement started in early March of this year and after a decade of a ceaseless grind in my education and subsequent career I’m still getting used to the free time. 

When I decided to go reduced time, I envisioned myself on Fridays doing thinks that make me happy, like crafts, sewing, baking, visiting coffee shops, museums, etc. Instead, I mostly do chores like laundry, run errands, organize and rearrange the house, and do admin tasks. I get this is all the boring tasks of life but I feel like instead of taking the time to work on my happiness, regulation, and life enjoyment I’m just picking up a larger portion of the unpaid labor in our house. My husband also does a lot around the house and also wants me to just rest/do fun stuff on Fridays but sometimes I feel like I can’t help it! I see laundry needs to be done and do that and then end up watering the plants and coordinating upcoming travel and replenishing the soap and the list goes on and on. I think I have a bad habit of not being able to rest unless our home is a certain way and it’s just an unrealistic standard to meet and takes most of my free time. My ADHD meds have actually helped me enormously in this regard and I have gotten less rigid since I’ve been medicated (for 4 years now!). 

Then if I do want to go start something fun or get out of the house I’m like eh, is that just shopping? Do I really need to [thrift, go to the bookstore, buy a coffee, start a new project], I just finish my stuff here. It’s never ending and honestly miserable. I’m just wondering if any one else feels like this or struggles with this and has a helpful reframe or coping techniques! Help a sister out 😂

1m92uzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1m92uzi/question_about_heteronormative_dynamics_and_the/,question about heteronormative dynamics and the formation of sexuality,"Long question but I have been reading some Dworkin and Butler I think they have some valid points, but have some things wrong as well, I guess my question is about the relationship between gender dynamics in the family early socialization and rejection of these sometimes negative behaviours and the formation of same sex attraction. (no this is not some conversion therapy nonsense) Anyways this is coming from a male perspective and would like to hear women's perspective on this, especially when it comes to navigating the desire of women for some gender conforming behaviours while not others. My question I suppose is why do (het) women often erotisize their own subjugation, do you think there is an inherent power dynamic or that social relations between men and women are formed this way through socialization? Is it possible for men to 'lead' in a way that woman want without viewing women as lesser/submissive to men? Do men use this presupposition that it's just 'innate' to treat women like trash / not take them as seriously in other areas of their lives?



full context below (sorry for the long paragraph, maybe I had too much coffee) 

I think there is some form of essential sexuality to humans and it's not entirely socialized. though I think a large portion of it is. I do sometimes find myself frustrated with being placed into the role or needing to be the 'aggressor' while simultaneously being told that aggression or bad or hurting women. I also recognize that oppressive heteronormative relations leave children not wanting to perpetuate that form of relationship, not always to the point of dating someone of the same sex, but not conducting that same behaviour that you saw in your parents of the father being a controlling sometimes violent narcissist and the mother being an absolute doormat. It's difficult to form hetero relationships outside this paradigm because often women desire these dynamics, even though now outright stating you want a man who is controlling or who will ""lead"" will get you called a bad feminist/person. It's a shitty cliche situation, where women on one hand want freedom and control over their lives in general society, but in their personal relationships they sometimes demand the opposite. Then as a man (in the west) you are basically told over and over that this kind of behaviour is bad. It's like you are paying for the sins of the father, and mens behaviour in other places in the world, yet women are reacting or at least coping in a way that would imply that they want men to behave this way. I think the allure of homosexual gender dynamics is a flattening of these negative gender dynamics or a freedom from them. Oddly enough at least between two men you are permitted to be more blunt about your desire, most gay men are not going to be offended by some proposition even if they are not interested unlike many women, and at the same time you are not made to feel like a predator, because you both being male are seen as closer in autonomy, and you are able to engage in more gender non conforming behaviours because you are already breaking one of the largest norms. I would assume this is similar for some lesbian people as well, you are allowed to act on your more 'womanly' impulse to pair up quickly, and at the same time you are able to engage in gender non conforming behaviours because you don't need to mold yourself according to hetero male preferences. I think there is an element to sexuality that does have quite a lot to do with the psycho-social and less with the biological, but this is not to say that it is mutable, or should be changed to fix the person. My other thought is that woman tend to sometimes fetishsize their own subjagation, and want to be treated in these ways, leading me to think there may some form of biological component to this, but on the other hand it's not universal and not all same sex attracted men like to be sexualized in a way that makes them feel 'submissive' or wanting to be in some power dynamic when it comes to sex.",2,1753458786.0,AskFeminists,1,1.0,False

Sleep
I am well hydrated

Tylenol + sleep

OB also prescribed promethazine which I haven’t tried yet. They also said it will really constipate me and I already deal with that lol 

At this point OB is also having me check my BP three times a day and to go to ER if the top number is over 140 or bottom is over 90. She mentioned stress can trigger headaches and of course I’m stressed and even more so after being told this!

I wanted to share some of my writing with you all in hopes that the Lord would be magnified and that all of you would be encouraged and blessed in some way. However, rather than drafting up yet another introduction to myself, perhaps I can simply share what I've already written on the Author page of my blog.

Dearest Reader,

For those of you who do not know me—or perhaps it has been quite some time since we’ve rubbed shoulders—allow me to introduce myself. My name is Joshua, and I suppose everything worth knowing about me can be distilled in only a few words: I am a writer, a teacher, a lover of long talks, even longer walks, and strong coffee; I am a friend to many, a husband to one, and above all, a *Christian.* 

With respect to the latter point, that of my union with Christ, if one is to know me at all they must first realize that everything about me has to be seen and understood from this particular vantage point. To understand this blog and its author, you would do well to first acquaint yourself with *Him,* the Lord of life and death, the Author of me and of you.

On this blog I will endeavor to speak on those things I love: my wife, my Lord, and the trillions of blessings—and sorrows—that lie between this life and the one to come. I love books and I love to write, but above all I love the One to whom these streams and shadows point—Christ Himself. In this way, my work here below as author, husband, friend, and disciple is to not only live and write well, but to do so in such a way that makes Him known.

I have often felt as though my very soul was born out of ink, penned upon the canvas of spirit by Him who is the very Author of life—what can I do but write unto Him in return? I relish the opportunity to write and walk along with you on this road, dear reader, until we reach our journey's end.

Your friend,

Joshua

I would encourage you, if you are interested in reading, to check out my work—it is my hope and prayer that the Lord would increase, that I would decrease, and that His word would stir you and strengthen you on our way towards home.

I’m a single, divorced woman in my 40s/50s, doing the work, emotionally intelligent, open to connection… and absolutely done with the current dating scene. I’m sick of the 3 month player cycle: guy swoops in saying all the right things, I care about you etc., then ghosts the second I call out lazy or disrespectful behaviour. Or worse… weeks of “good morning babe, have a super day” texts and photos of his dinner, only to meet for one low-effort coffee after I drop a few hints like why did you give me your number if you aren’t going to ask me out? Then I get hit with, “Sorry, I didn’t feel a spark.” Really? You needed three weeks of texting and a latte to decide that?

The bar is so low it’s below ground level.

Dating apps are just sad at this point. It’s like a digital graveyard of men who’ve been circling since 2020, haven’t bothered to write a bio, or if they have it’s “no drama”! Dodgy profile pics either in sunglasses, I can see up their nose the camera is so close, or no shirt, and looking for a “long term relationship” which clearly isn’t the case. It’s draining, depressing, and frankly embarrassing to keep opening up only to get breadcrumbed or insulted.

Where are the real men? The ones who are emotionally mature, genuinely want a relationship, and understand that effort and consistency come from both sides? Do they exist? Or are they just avoiding dating apps like the rest of us who still have a shred of self-respect?

Anaiah's POV

My name is Anaiah Ross. I'm the most undesired wolf in the pack because when I shifted into my wolf for the first time, I ended Tomas Rivers, our Alpha's brother, who attempted to do bad things to me. 

Tomas Rivers was a pedophile who used to touch me in the most inappropriate way when no one was watching. That's why I'm not sorry I ended him. 

Since that day, the pack has been mistreating and bullying me. They beat, starve me and make me clean the pack house day in and day out. I tried to tell them that it was only self-defense but they didn't believe me. Tomas's wife, Leah, denied all the accusations and said that her husband was the perfect man, but I know she knows the truth.

Even my parents turned their backs on me because, after the murder, they were demoted from their Gamma status to Omegas. Omegas are considered the weakest link of the pack, others are strong, but most of them are just cleaners and help out around the pack. They have no major role to play, like fighting in wars or any important pack political business. 

""Where is that woman!"" Leah sneers. I roll my eyes because of everyone here, she makes my life horrible. I was supposed to be banished after I ended Tomas but my parents pleaded and asked on my behalf, saying that it was my first shift and just lost control.

I get out of my tiny room, it is very small and has almost an old walk-in closet, next to the store room on the second floor. There is a mattress and an old broken mirror. I only have a few clothes, shoes, and a collection of my favorite books.

I get out of the room, mentally preparing myself for all the insults and beating I'm to receive. I groan. Once in the main room, I see Leah standing elegantly in a long dress and heels, one hand on her hip as she taps her feet against the floor in impatience, the other hand holding a yellow fabric that she throws in my face as soon as I'm at arm's reach. I remove it from my face and throw it on the floor, annoyed.

""Um..."" I trail pointing at the dress on the floor. Leah looks livid now and I didn't expect her to slap me, no, I did. She slaps me hard across my face and red splatters from my nose as I fell to the ground from the impact of her slap. She kicks me once again in the stomach and I grunt. 

""I told you to hand wash it!"" She yells. I cover my face with my arms as my face blows after blow. It has been like this since her husband died and I'm here to take all her dislike.

I picked myself up from the floor after Leah was tired of beating me. I go to the Omega bathroom to clean my body, the cold water hits my body and I shiver. Slowly, I clean my body and leave the bathroom, using the lotion I left there and wearing the clothes I wore earlier. I am going to get started on breakfast. The packed house has over 100 people staying here, they live in luxurious suites with their families, while others who are unmatched or without families have designer rooms.

With only a few other Omegas to help me, I prepared breakfast. There are sausages, bacon, toast, eggs, and beans, they eat a full English breakfast every morning. I start to serve when I see him, Amos, he's our future Alpha and one of the strongest wolves there is, he's a big player and a Cassanova. But I still have a small crush on him.

He mostly irritates me and bullies me like others. The last time I spilled coffee on his girlfriend Eunice, he slapped me. My wolf wanted to fight back but I knew he could end our lives in an instant.

Amos's eyes met mine and he visibly stiffened and widened his eyes. I ignore his weird behavior and continue serving breakfast. Ignoring all the snarky comments they are throwing my way. I look at my parents but they only look at me with disgust and dislike in their gaze. I swallow and inhale, walking away sadly. Tears were well in my eyes but I didn't cry. I can't be weak. I need to leave this place once I'm eighteen and start a new life for myself, so I promised myself to be strong. I will survive, I will take all the beating.

'Don't worry, our mate will love us,' beams my wolf, Chalo. 

A mate is a soulmate that completes a wolf's life. Once they are in pain, it is felt by the other and my wolf has been wanting to get one since we learned what mates are, and she believes he will save us from all the pain and torture. He will love us forever and we will have a beautiful family I didn't have.

I see a few students going to school and I smile. I miss school even though all they did was prank me, but my teachers were good to me because I was a straight A student and would win most competitions. The Alpha and Luna stopped my education in my sophomore year because they said they can't waste their resources on me when all I'm good for is cleaning and cooking, plus, let's face it, I wasn't going to get into a good college.

After I was done with my chores, I decided to get some vitamin D outside as my skin was too pale due to being indoors. I smile when the sun hits my skin and my wolf purrs. I hid in the bleachers while watching the warriors of the pack train. I like to observe them while they train so that I can know some basics about defending myself.

The Dawnrise is not the strongest there is and has survived this far by maintaining a good relationship with other strong packs like the Lycans who are royalty to us. Dawnrise's worst fear is angering a stronger pack. Hence, every year, they hold a ceremony to renew their treaties where they feast and celebrate alliances that were made many years ago.

I feel a hand roughly grab my hair from behind and I fall on my back facing the sky. Eunice is standing over me, her arms crossed over her chest with a triumphant smile on her face. I scowl and try to get up, but a kick in my stomach stops me. She and her two bimbos hit me several times and she snarls.

""Don't make eye contact with my boyfriend again!""

**Chapter 2 The Dungeon, The Rejection**

Anaiah's POV

I cough, making my ribs hurt. My wolf is trying to help me heal quickly, but since we don't shift as much as the others, my healing is not as good as other wolves.

I get up to my feet with so much difficulty, but she kicks my legs and I fall back down, she puts her heel over my neck, and I close my eyes, waiting for the worst.

""What I have to do is press a little harder and I can take you out of your misery,"" She says in that annoying tone of hers. My heart is beating so fast and my wolf is growling menacingly even though she can't fight back in this situation, she has a strong fighting spirit and most times has given in to me, but I know when to quit and she doesn't. I don't want to die.

My wolf, Chalo, resurfaces, and, using her strength, I kick Eunice in the legs so that she is on the ground. Those weak women minions of hers scream, scared, but no one tries to stop me. Anger courses through me, I feel the adrenaline pumping through me and I hover over her, punching her face repeatedly. Soon, the men that were training surrounded us. Others were cheering while others are telling her to beat me, but I know, Eunice, she only barks and has had no bite since we were young.

A tingling sensation rushes down my skin as I feel myself being lifted off Eunice's body by huge strong hands but my wolf is not done with her yet, so I kick and scream.

""Let me go!"" I scream at whoever is carrying me away from there. I jump off the shoulder of the man who carries me and am ready to punch him in the face, but I'm taken back to see it is Amos, the Alpha's son. He looks so attracting  in his basketball shorts, his hair is disheveled, and  his chest is so attracting . I can see his muscular body and I swallow thickly. Seeing that I'm staring, he smirks at me and I blush involuntarily, looking away from him.

""Causing trouble, Omega?"" He says in an angry voice.

""She came at me first!"" I retorted.

""You'll be punished for what you did. Do you know who she is?"" He growls, pushing me against the tree. I wince at the pain in my back. He wraps his hand around my neck and chokes me

""She's your Luna,"" he grits.

I try to hit him but he doesn't let go. It's like hitting a wall, my oxygen starts to cut and until all energy has left me, he finally lets me go and I fall to the ground, inhaling as much air as I can.

He crouches down next to me and looks at me with a softness I've never seen before while I glare at him. His eyes turn a shade darker and I know he is linking with someone. When he's done, he clears his throat and orders.

""You will be locked in the dungeon for the coming days,"" I widen my eyes in horror.

""But she started it!"" I croak, I've been in the dungeons a few times and It's not a place I like to be, it's dark and scary, and the guards there are the most immoral while they beat the offenders. They assault women they like. It has happened to me a few times, but I wasn't raped.

He stands up to leave but turns to look at me, ""Before I forget, I Amos Rivers, reject you, Anaiah Ross, as my mate and future Luna.""

I was in shock and his words kept repeating in my head. I didn't say anything or even react. Amos was my mate, he's twenty-four years old, so he knew all along that we were mated but watched them beat and abuse me.

Amos is standing over me with no emotions on his face, no remorse whatsoever.

""Guards!""

A few guards ran to us, bowing before the Alphas. Behind them, Eunice is there too, her eyes are red and her perfect blonde hair is disheveled, her plastic face with cuts and she has a cut on her lips. She comes to stand next to the Alpha and whispers something in his ears and after a long thought, he nods his acceptance.

""Lock her up, whip her every day until I say no more,"" Her voice is smooth as she orders but my eyes are fixed on my mate, a sting on my cheek brings me back to the present and I touch my cheeks. Suddenly, tears fall and I don't have the chance to wipe them. Strong, huge hands grab my arms and drag me a few feet away from the two couples. Once in the dark dungeon, I'm thrown to the ground like a sack of potatoes and they exit the room, then, I feel it, my chest begins to constrict and a fire within me begins to burn terribly. I let out a sob and, for the first time in forever, I cried. I cry for the horrible life I've lived since I was thirteen years old, I cry for my parents, their abandonment, their dislike and, lastly, I cry for Amos, my mate. I thought when I found my mate, he would love and protect me as a mate should, but today, he's taken away all my will to fight, my wolf withdraws to the dark part of my mind and I howl, feeling more alone than ever.

Days passed by fast and every day, the guards came to wipe me with very painful lashes, my back had cuts and tears of flesh on it. I bet I looked bad. I am only allowed one meal a day; bread and water. I haven't felt Chalo since our mate rejected us. 

She is depressed and sad just like me. I get up from the cold floor and clutch my chest as I say the words.

""I, Anaiah Ross, accept your rejection, Amos Rivers,"" I don't feel the bond breaking on my side however, Amos will feel the bond tear between us and will experience pain like no other. 

**Chapter 3 She Has Accepted Our Rejection**

Amos's POV

I was welcoming our guests for the renewal treaty celebration when something kept tugging on my heart. Something was wrong, my wolf Narcisse was giving me a hard time, growling and snarling at me. There are times he acts sick, he dislikes me and I rejected our mate, but I can't accept her as my mate, especially my Luna. She ended my uncle.

'In self-defense!' Narcisse growls. 

'No one believes her,' I retort. My uncle was a bad person, but he was still my family. She could have dealt with the situation better than ending him in coldness.

'She was thirteen years old! She had no control over her wolf, Amos, I can tell that her wolf is strong,' he says the last part proudly. Indeed, my uncle had Alpha power and was one of the strongest wolves, but she still bested him. 

Anaiah Ross is not only the most beautiful girl in the pack, but even behind her miry clothes, she can make any man bow to his knees. She is strong as well. She has endured so many hardships since she was a little girl.

'She can make a fine Luna,' Breathes Narcisse. 

'Yes, not ours, we shall make Eunice our Luna as my parents want. Her parents are strong and have been our allies for years,'

Eunice is an entitled crying baby, but I have to be with her to strengthen my pack and she's a good, but mostly when I do her or any other wolf, I picture Anaiah, her baby blue eyes, her long hair. Her  lips and beautiful face are enough to make me like a teenager for the first time. 

She's the epitome of beauty. I excuse myself and go to my office. I call an Omega who is more than happy.

""Oh my Alpha, you are amazing, as usual,"" she purrs. I go to my desk and sit on my chair,  relaxing when I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my chest. I groan and growl, and the Omega comes to me worried, but I bear my sharp canines at her and she staggers, falling on her side in fear.

""Get out,"" I growl as the pain only intensifies. 

'WHAT IS GOING ON?' I ask Narcisse. He's also in so much pain.

'Our mate has accepted our rejection,' 

'NO!' I roar.

Captain Miles…

Captain Thalor?

…I don’t even know which name to scribble on these things anymore. Maybe I should just start calling myself “the ghost of Thalor.”

Well… on the bright side: the crew’s still breathing, the ship still sputters along—and yet, I still haven’t figured out how to fix the reactor without tripping the coolant system again. Thalor would’ve laughed at me. Grinning, smug, and spewing some dumb metaphor about “sweetening the engines with love.”

Such a lovable idiot.

I caught myself humming that old Corsasian tune he used to blast over the intercom in our rustbucket sub—“Rise with the Tide.”

Funny. I used to hate it. Now it just makes me feel…

Feel like the walls are listening.

Philip gave me a nod today. That means something.

I think.

Or maybe he just had something in his eye.

He doesn’t talk much, but when he does, it’s the kind of phrase that sticks in your mind forever.

“Trying too hard to be a dead man makes you the dead one.”

Still don’t know if that was an insult or advice. Maybe both.

Either way, he wouldn’t get it.

Not like *I* get it.

Caboose won’t even look at me anymore.

I don’t blame him.

It probably finally dawned on that childish brain of his—there’s more going on under this patched-up uniform than I let on.

I see it in his face every time I speak—like he’s waiting for the moment I finally snap and fly us all into the sun.

Wouldn’t be the *worst way* to go, honestly.

I’m beginning to think he’s faking the dumb act just to lighten the mood.

He gets real quiet when I talk down to him. Smiles too wide. Like he thinks he’s above me.

**He’s not.**

Axel’s still pushing therapy. Still pretending not to take notes behind my back.

But I see them.

He thinks I’m crumbling. That I’ve wrapped myself in Thalor’s old coat to escape something worse.

He’s not wrong.

I just don’t have the energy to lie about it anymore.

And Sugarcap—he looks at me like a kid afraid to wake a sleeping giant.

Like he’s trying not to breathe too loud around me.

Every morning, he offers me coffee that’s way too sweet—just to hear me say “thanks.”

I always do. That’s… probably the only kindness I’ve got left in me.

Ironic, right?

Big scary looking demon-man, scared of me?

**Ha!**

Thalor would’ve had something to say about that.

He always did. Like it was his job, his duty as my best friend to throw in one last quip.

I still hear his voice sometimes.

Right before he left “Thanks, Miles. For building this. For believing in me.”

It hurts.

But this is what he would’ve wanted.

Thalor, out in space, a crew, helping people, making a difference—it’s everything he dreamed of.

I just… wish he was here to see it.

**No.**

He is here.

He’s **always** with me.

We **always** did things together.

He just…

He never told me how hard it was.

How hard it is to lead a crew when you can’t even lead yourself.

*Haha… oh, you’re losing it, Miles.*

I’ve been staring at the ship’s logs for hours.

They say we’re charting unexplored systems. But I’ve been rerunning the same patrol route for weeks.

I even rerouted navigation to make it look like we’re going somewhere.

I guess it’s easier for the crew to believe we have a destination.

Me?

I just sit in his chair and let the ghost of my best friend pilot what’s left of me.

Maybe tomorrow I’ll shave.

Maybe tomorrow I’ll stop talking to his reflection in the mirror.

Or maybe tomorrow…

…I’ll finally admit the only reason I’m still alive…

…is because I can’t stand the thought of him being gone and forgotten.",4,1753458345.0,RobloxAvatars,7,1.0,False

I've been on the search for a handful of folks with whom I can hangout with and feel welcome. There have always been interesting people that have come and gone, but alas none seemed to stick given the transient nature of online gaming. However, you do miss 100% of the shots you don't take, so I guess I'm still giving it a try.

I play a mix of genres but a few titles that I'm still playing today are:

* Balatro
* League of Legends (arams)
* Gem TD (a custom DotA 2 map, very niche)
* Dead by Daylight (I'm 50/50 for the most part and have about 2,300 hours)
* Gunfire Reborn
* Slay the Spire
* Pokémon Violet/Scarlet
* Abiotic Factor and Palworld are on the horizon for consideration as well

I was competitive some years ago, but at this age with full-time work and responsibilities I have long lost that edge and just play for fun/socializing/killing time. Winning or losing doesn't matter to me and I do occasionally get frustrated as I'm only human to be fully transparent but it dissipates quickly and usually doesn't get to me much.

I do value the quality of the people I'm around more so than the quantity and would need to break the ice with people before getting too comfortable. Yes, I am more introverted than not but not to the point of not being able to converse with people. If there is an interesting conversation or discussion about a topic that I happen to be passionate about, I can be quite the yapper too though usually am reserved and more on the quiet side.

Outside of gaming, work and chores around the place definitely takes a lot of time but I also like to read non-fiction, watch videos on topics like history, space and science in general, make tea/coffee/decent meals and play music (piano mostly).

1m92lhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRP_Infrastructure/comments/1m92lhs/cross_border_mafia/,Cross Border Mafia,"🌍 Why XRP Is Poised to Take Over Cross-Border Payments (And Legacy Finance Knows It)

Let’s talk about the elephant in the global banking room: cross-border payments are still operating like it’s 1995. Swift codes, delayed transfers, opaque fees, and settlement times that make molasses look speedy. While fintechs patch the cracks, Ripple and XRP are quietly laying the new pipes entirely.

Here’s why XRP isn’t just “a crypto project” anymore — it’s a full-blown infrastructure solution for the future of global payments.


💸 1. The Problem: Legacy Cross-Border Payments Are Broken

Right now, if you want to send money from New York to Nairobi, it’s:

Expensive 💰

Slow ⏳

Intransparent 🕵️

Reliant on outdated correspondent banking chains that can take 3-5 days or more to settle.


Oh, and don’t forget the hidden fees, multiple middlemen, and exchange rate headaches.



⚡ 2. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) Was Built for Speed and Scale

XRP isn’t trying to be everything. It’s not chasing meme status or trying to replace your coffee shop wallet. It’s laser-focused on instant settlement and liquidity bridging between currencies.

Key stats:

Transaction finality: ~3-5 seconds

Cost per transaction: Fractions of a cent

Scalability: 1,500+ transactions per second

Energy usage: Minimal (no mining)


Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum (without L2s), XRP is a layer-1 solution built for enterprise-grade throughput and settlement at the speed of business.



🏦 3. Banks & Institutions Are Already Testing It

RippleNet — Ripple’s global payments network — isn’t a fantasy concept. It already includes over 100 financial institutions, including:

SBI Holdings (Japan)

Santander (Europe)

Tranglo (Asia-Pacific corridor)

Novatti, Zand Bank, and others in the UAE, Australia, and Africa


Many of them are using ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) — XRP-powered transactions that eliminate the need for pre-funded Nostro accounts. That’s capital unlocked, efficiency gained, and real-time payments delivered.


🌐 4. XRP Is Regulatory Battle-Tested (Yes, Even in the U.S.)

After the long SEC lawsuit saga, Ripple came out swinging with a legal ruling that clarified XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets. That’s regulatory clarity — something most cryptos wish they had in the U.S.

With MiCA compliance in Europe, licenses in Dubai, Singapore, and the UK, and partnerships with Mastercard and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on CBDC pilots… Ripple isn’t knocking on the door anymore. They’re already in the room.


🪙 5. RLUSD: Ripple’s Institutional-Grade Stablecoin Is the On-Ramp

Ripple launched RLUSD, a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin built natively on XRPL and Ethereum, with regulatory compliance, institutional custody (BNY Mellon), and real-world integrations (Fedwire, EU MiCA standards).

It’s already processing $1 billion+ in monthly volume and rapidly climbing the stablecoin rankings.

RLUSD = fiat rails
XRP = liquidity bridge
RippleNet = messaging and routing system

That’s a complete system, not just a coin.


📊 6. Tokenization + Interoperability = The Future of Payments

Ripple is making major moves in real-world asset tokenization, including:

Tokenizing $16 billion in real estate in Dubai

Working with central banks on CBDC settlement rails

Launching XRP futures and ETFs on CME and Nasdaq


The XRP Ledger supports native token issuance, hooks for programmability, and bridges to other blockchains and fiat systems — which positions it as a universal translator for value.


🔄 7. It’s Not Just Adoption — It’s Compounding Momentum

Ripple’s strategy compounds:

Acquisitions (like Hidden Road for a U.S. broker-dealer license)

Strategic partnerships (OpenPayd, Alchemy Pay, Mastercard)

Real utility (ODL corridors in over 40 countries)

Regulatory wins


Every move builds on the last, creating network effects legacy finance simply can’t replicate fast enough.



🧠 TL;DR: XRP Isn’t the Future of Payments. It’s Already Here.

Real-time settlement

Low-cost transactions

Institutional adoption

Legal clarity

Interoperability with fiat and crypto

Enterprise-grade infrastructure


While the mainstream obsesses over ETFs and meme coins, Ripple is doing the boring, foundational, world-changing work — and XRP is the engine powering it all.

So when you hear “XRP will dominate cross-border payments,” just know: it’s not a theory. It’s already happening.

Council's Academy: Hidden Royal



\*\*\*



Alpha Talon's P.O.V.*（Talon is Taliyah's father.）*



I am sitting in my office, when a videocall comes in. Surprised at the ID on my screen, I wonder if I should answer it.



As soon as I answer the call, I can see that he is furious and I want to know what the cause of his rage is. I contemplate on how to phrase my question, but it is not necessary because he starts ranting as soon as he sees that I have answered his call.



“What is wrong with women? How difficult is it to put a pup in to this world?” I immediately know that his latest Mate failed to give him a living pup.



“Did she survive or do you need to find another Mate?” I ask even though I have a feeling I already know the answer.



“She survived giving birth, but she didn’t survive me.” He screams and I hear something crashing against the wall. “When she told me that my Son had not survived, I grab her by the throat and squeezed the life out of her.”



I let him scream and yell as I try to figure out what to say. The man on the other side of the call is as cruel as I am. We both take what we want, in any way that we want it.



The difference is that he has a bigger problem controlling his anger then I do. His fated Mate died in childbirth together with his Son, after that he took a chosen Mate and for a while I thought he had found something with her.



But when their Son was born dead, he had ripped her apart. His Beta’s Mate had tried to comfort him, but there was only one thing his Wolf thought could help him and he had forced himself on to her.



His Beta had taken his Mate and they had left his Pack, none of us know where they went. For a few days I thought he might have gone to the Palace, but no one ever showed up to hold Roger accountable for his actions.



The women in his Pack fear him and for good reason, because he has forced himself on almost every female in his Pack. The males don’t do anything against it, because in his Pack every male has a chosen Mate and for that reason they don’t really feel pain when their Mate is with someone else.



I have taken liberties with some of them as well, while I was visiting his Pack. We both enjoyed watching the other take an unwilling woman and I groan as I remember the last time I went to see him.



If I remember correctly this was chosen Mate number four and I doubt it will take him long to get himself another Mate.



“Do you need me to come over?” I ask and my thing hardens as I think of what I want to do. His head snaps in my direction and a smile creeps on to his face. “Get here as fast as you can, alone.” He states and disconnects the call.



I adjust myself and link my Mate to get to my office.



There is a knock on the door and before I can answer my Mate walks in, as she looks at me she can see the bulge in my pants. Her hips are swaying as she makes her way over to my desk.



I just sit back as she gets on her knees... ...

She knows exactly what I want now. She knows how to please both me and my wolf.



**Chapter 2**





Taliyah’s P.O.V.



My name is Taliyah, Alpha Talon's daughter, and I am twenty-five years old.



The world as you know it, no longer exists. In this time and age Humans are a myth. Most of the Human civilization was destroyed during the war, torn down or has crumbled to pieces over the centuries.



Only the high-ways still exist, smaller roads are nothing more than dirt roads. Cities and villages are mostly gone, taken over by nature.



Not that we care, because nature is our friend. We love running through the forests around us.



None of us knows what the world looked like back then, there are only stories, files and pictures left in the Council’s Archives.



Let me tell you how that happened.



Centuries ago, the Humans discovered the existence of Werewolves and Lycans. We were outed by a reporter, someone who didn’t care about anything but herself.



A Werewolf Alpha found out she was his Mate. Because every Lycan and Werewolf knows the significance of a Mate, we know that every Lycan or Werewolf would have done the same. He told her the truth about who and what he was, hoping that she would accept him. His explanation, his turning in to a Werewolf to show her the truth, it was all recorded.



She asked him for time to process it all, realizing it was a lot to deal with he gave her time and she broadcasted it within an hour after he left.



As soon as the news reached him on what she had done, he went to her workplace to confront her and that is when it all went to hello. Security guards and cops that recognized him, tried to capture him and that is when Humankind found out that we were living among them.



Some of the guards and cops were Werewolves and Lycans and they came to the aid of the Alpha. He was able to get away and he took his Mate with him.



The Archives tell us that he delivered her to the Council, he rejected her and left her behind after he told them to do with her as they pleased. They questioned her and once it was clear that she did it to gain fame, they sentenced her to death.



The rejection, her trail, her conviction and sentencing were broadcasted in real-time and it started an all-out war with the Humans.



No one blamed the Alpha for what he did, after all every Werewolf and Lycan wants to find his or her Mate. Our Mate completes us; they give us comfort, they give us strength. The Mate-bond is a strong and powerful thing, so most kept looking for their Mate, we still do.



Some Humans accepted the fact that they were Mated to a Werewolf or Lycan and some didn’t accept it and committed suicide even though the Council informed the Humans through a broadcast that rejecting a Lycan or Werewolf would suffice.



And in some cases parents or siblings killed their entire family after they found out one of their children or siblings were mated to a Werewolf or Lycan.



After decades most Humans were gone and those that still lived among us, chose not to have children. With no more Humans being born, they went extinct and the Humans that were mated to a Werewolf or Lycan would not give birth to a Human. After all their genes were not as dominant as ours.



And now, centuries later, the only reason we are still taught about Humans, has to do with the fact that sometimes a Pup turns out to be Wolfless. As soon as we become of age, we shift for the first time.



Werewolves become of age on their eighteenth birthday and Lycans on their twenty-first birthday.



If a Pup does not shift, they are called wolfless, they can’t shift and they don’t have the speed or the strength of our kind.



And I am one of them, I am wolfless or at least that is what I let everyone believe.



My Father is Alpha Talon, Alpha of the Blue Crystal Pack. My Father is cruel, a sexist and he takes whatever he wants from whoever he wants.



My Father either ignores me or he treats me like a servant. He refuses to call me by the name my Mother gave to me. He always calls me Tali, because he doesn’t consider me a gift.



My name Taliyah means Gift and my Mother told me that she gave me that name because I was a gift from the Goddess.



The only one that actually calls me Taliyah is my Brother, Xandros and he is also the only one that treats me normal. At least when my family is not around and even though I dislike it, I know he does it to keep me safe.



The day my Mother died, my Father marked Alena as his Chosen Mate and she is no better than my Father. She always calls for me when something has to be done.



I also think she hates me because I refused to call her Mother or Mom after my Father marked her. Ayden, my oldest Brother, calls her Mother, but like me Xandros refuses.



I know that she blames me for that, after all I told her, in front of a lot of Pack-members, that I would never call her Mother even if my life would depend on it.



I am still hoping that one day soon I will find my Mate and if the Goddess is on my side, he will be from another Pack. So I can finally leave this shithole behind.



I smile at the thought of walking out of the Pack-house and I can already hear Alena cussing and swearing, because it will mean she has to find someone else to bug.



My Uncle, who is also the Pack’s Gamma, and his Mate show me time and time again what it is like to have your Fated Mate by you side. They remind me of the stories my Mother used to tell me as a bedtime story.



Growing up, my Mother would tell me stories of my Grandparents. They met at a masquerade Ball, hosted at the Palace. My Grandmother wore a beautiful, deep red ballgown and my Grandfather wore a dark three-pieced suite.



They felt the pull towards each other, the second they were both in the ball-room. The room fell quiet as my Grandfather made his way over to his Mate, my Grandmother was in shock to find her Mate so soon after becoming of age.



My Mother told me about her childhood, growing up with an older Brother and both her parents around. That even after many years of being together, they would not let the opportunity pass by to touch one and other.



To cuddle and hold the other in their arms. To steal a kiss when they thought no one was looking.



My Mother was always smiling as she told me those stories at bedtime.





**Chapter 3**





Alena’s P.O.V.



As I walk out of the office, I see Tali walking in to the kitchen. She is my Mate’s Daughter and her birth ruined everything for my Mate. I wish there was a way to get rid of her.



“Luna Alena, will Alpha Talon be home for dinner?” an Omega asks as I am still looking at the entrance of the kitchen. She shakes me from my thoughts and I growl at her.



“No, he is away on business for a few days.” I say and I make my way upstairs to our room. I need to clean myself up after what he did to me.



I know that Talon cares for no one but himself, but being his Mate gives me status. A status I would never have gotten waiting for my fated Mate. My parents proved it to me in the end, because when my Father died my Mother lost her mind and little by little she withered away.



She was killed by rogues when she wandered out of the house one night, the Pack-doctor said that she had no defensive wounds and there for he concluded that she did not put up a fight.



I swore I would never find myself in her situation and by accepting Talon as my Mate I severed the bond to my unknown Mate. As far as our kind knows the Goddess would have given him a new Mate and he would never know that I was technically his first Mate.



The hot water streaming down my back eases the pain Talon caused me, even though he made me come harder than ever before.



I close my eyes and my hand glides between my legs, I remember the feeling as he ... Tears run down my cheeks.



I knew it, the moment his Wolf took over. He and his Wolf are both borderline sadistic and hearing him tell me to scream, I knew he got turned on by my pain.



What I had not expected was to feel pleasure as Talon...





Alpha Roger’s P.O.V.



After ending the call with Talon I feel a little bit better, but I know that my Wolf has not settled down yet.



I let the females in my Pack run through my mind, I need to find the perfect woman for me and Talon. A knock on the door startles me out of my thoughts and I am about to get pissed, until I sense who is on the other side.



I tell him to enter and in walks my best Delta. He took a chosen Mate recently, but he told me she is acting out.



“How is your Mate doing?” I ask him and the murderous look in his eyes tells me enough. “Talon is on his way, send her here as soon as he arrives.” A smirk crosses his face and he nods his head.



I ask him if there was a reason for his visit and he tells me I already helped him out with it.



Half an hour later Talon is sitting on the couch as a soft knock on the door is heard. “Come in.” I say as I smile at Talon, he has no idea of the treat waiting on the other side of the door.



“You wanted to see me, Alpha Roger?” She asks, while she looks at the floor. “Why don’t you close the door and take a seat.” I gesture at the chair on the other side of my desk.



As she sits down, Talon gets up and I know the same thing runs through his mind.



“Your Mate tells me you have some trouble adjusting to your mated life.” I say quietly and her head snaps up. I can tell she had not seen that one coming. Talon takes the seat next to her and asks her what the problem is.



Her eyes return to the floor as she whispers “He wants to do things I don’t want.” Talon asks if she can tell him what those things might be. The way he is talking I would almost think he actually cares, but I think I know why he is acting this way.



She softly tells him that her Mate wants to share her with his brother, that he wants them to take her at the same time.



My thing hardens thinking about that sight and I know that before the night is over she will know that it would have been easier if she had given in. Talon puts his hand on her knee and asks her why she refused it.



She slowly looks up at him and tells him that she is a wirgen, that she can’t imagine having two men at the same time.



She tries to move away from Talon as his hand is sliding up her leg and I move to the door and lock it, using my Werewolf speed. It startles her as soon as she hears the click of the lock.



“Sweetheart, you are going to find out, it might have been better if you had given in to your Mate. Because now you will learn that we don’t care what you want, we only care about what we want.” Talon says as he shoves his hand between her legs.





**Chapter 4**



Alpha Talon’s P.O.V.



She fights me, but she is no match for an Alpha. Especially not an Alpha like me or Roger.



Roger grabs her hair and pulls her head back, making her scream. I chuckle, because we both like it when they scream. I began to touch her and I am not gentle.



“You will take everything we give you. Scream all you want, no one will help you.” I whispers in her ear.



I let my claw come out and I start to rip the clothes from her, Roger is enjoying himself, seeing more and more of her delectable body. 



“Maybe we should invite your Mate and his Brother to come watch us as we show you what we want to do.”



As I hear a knock on the door, Roger opens it for his Delta and his brother and locks it behind them.



They turn the seats in front of his desk around and take a seat. I have already moved her from her seat and I have shoved the coffee table aside.



She is crying and whimpering, but it doesn’t stop me or Roger from what we want.

I haven't applied for the program yet because I have one more advanced elective to take. I spoke to my advisor about wanting my career to reach a point where I can have my studio and a business that has an art gallery and maybe a coffee/retail shop. They recommended that I change my major to IADS in the ART Management field to be closer to that path. I'm conflicted about this because my intention of starting college at 22 was to have a space where I could practically learn how to draw and get better with different mediums. So if I decide to switch my major now, I won't be able to have the same classes as if I were in the studio art program.

In the morning, Marco gently lifted the sheets, waking me up in his unique way.

He nestled one leg between mine, his large hand roaming between my thighs, sending shivers through me.

""No, I have to work today!""

I tried to stop him, but it was already too late.

With a sharp rip, Marco tore open a condom and put it on, then lifted my legs.

""Mm!"" I wanted to make a sound, but he firmly covered my mouth.

Marco suddenly became forceful, thrusting his thick, long penis inside me relentlessly, giving me no chance to catch my breath.

Perhaps because it was morning, Marco lasted especially long this time.

Two hours later, Marco finished showering, opened the front door, and strode out without a word.

I sat dazed on the edge of the bed, staring at the marks on the sheets, unsure if they were from Marco's sweat or mine, my cheeks involuntarily flushing.

Marco is my husband, but apart from knowing his name and that he runs a tech company, I know nothing about him.

I don't even know where I got the courage to marry a man I had only met twice.

Just a few days ago, my best friend Francesca convinced me to go on a blind date at the Red Rose Restaurant.

Three years ago, I was betrayed and abandoned by a scumbag, kicked out of my home by my family, and nearly lost everything.

Since then, I completely gave up on love. But Francesca kept insisting, because she believed I needed to bravely move on from my emotional setbacks.

""You can't hide forever, Aria,"" she insisted. ""Meeting him and having dinner together, it's no big deal, right?""

I arrived fifteen minutes early, nervously smoothing down my simple blue dress as I entered the restaurant. What struck me immediately was how empty the place was—just one man sitting alone at a table by the window.

As soon as he saw me, he stood up elegantly. His tall and imposing figure, over 1.9 meters in height, exuded strength, with broad shoulders accentuated by a perfectly tailored navy blue suit, as if he could bear the weight of the entire world. Before he even introduced himself, I found myself irresistibly drawn to him.

His hair was a deep brown, slightly curly, and meticulously groomed. His face was sharply defined, like a sculpted masterpiece, with a high, prominent nose and thin lips beneath it, the corners of which curved slightly upward in a faint, enigmatic smile. Seeing this, a burning flush quickly spread across my cheeks.

His eyes were a deep, inky green, and when his gaze swept over me, my heartbeat quickened uncontrollably.

My feet felt as if they were nailed to the ground, unable to move. My ears burned, and even my breathing became rapid and uneven, until his voice broke the spell .

""Ms. Rossi,"" he said, his voice deep and smooth as he pulled out my chair. ""Thank you for being punctual.""

I fumbled with my purse, pulling out the dating profile Francesca had helped me prepare, along with my internship credentials and contact information.

""I'm Alia Rossi,"" I said, sliding the papers across the table. ""I'm currently studying at San Luca University and interning at—""

""I know who you are,"" he interrupted, not even glancing at my carefully prepared documents. His intense gaze never left my face, making my cheeks flush. ""Let's order first.""

Throughout dinner, he asked questions about my studies, my interests, my family—but revealed almost nothing about himself. Just as dessert arrived, he leaned forward, those dark eyes capturing mine.

“Miss Alia, I have a good impression of you. How about we set a time to get our marriage license?”

“What?!” I nearly spat out the water I’d just sipped, staring at him wide-eyed, convinced I’d misheard.

Marriage? We’ve known each other for less than half an hour!

“Mr. Vittorio, are you… is this some kind of prank? Because this joke isn’t funny at all!”

He leaned back in his chair, fingers lightly tapping the table, his tone calm but resolute. “I thought Miss Alia felt the same way I do—wanting to build a family, get married, have children, and live an ordinary life as husband and wife.”

I pinched my thigh hard under the table to make sure I wasn’t dreaming, then took a closer look at the man in front of me.

“This is our first meeting!” I exclaimed, exasperated, thinking this man must either be crazy or trying to use me for some shady scheme.

Marco smiled, a deep, meaningful smile. “First meeting? No, the moment you walked into this restaurant, I felt as if I’d already met you, Miss Alia.”

“Marriage isn’t a game,” I protested. “People date for months, even years, before making a commitment like that.”

Marco leaned back further, studying me. “We’re both well-educated and ambitious. I believe you’d make a wonderful wife. Are you willing to trust that I can be a worthy husband?”

“But we only met today,” I said, my cheeks burning under the intensity of Marco’s affectionate gaze. I couldn’t bring myself to meet his eyes any longer.

A faint smile curled at the corner of his lips. “Alia, would you like to be my wife?”

My heart stopped.

I studied his face closely. Even without a confession or a diamond ring, I somehow felt that his words came from a place of genuine sincerity.

God, Alia, how could you even think like this? Are you so weak for a handsome face that you can’t think straight? Wasn’t it bad enough being humiliated, abandoned, and betrayed by a man three years ago?

Before I could respond, Marco slid a business card across the table.

“You have one night to think it over. Tomorrow morning, I’ll be waiting for your answer.”

That night, I couldn’t sleep a wink. Marco’s image kept flashing through my mind—his confident demeanor, those eyes that seemed to see right through me. For the life of me, I couldn’t recall where we might have met before.

His business card sat on my bedside table while I tossed and turned, unable to rest.

I had just started my internship, and according to the company’s tradition, female employees who weren’t married had a slim chance of being offered a permanent position. That was the reason I agreed to go on this blind date arranged by Francesca.

If I got married, I could secure my job, afford to rent a bigger place, and prove to myself—and others—that I was doing better than before… I was startled by this wild, reckless side of myself.

In the end, I picked up the phone and dialed.

“It’s me,” he answered calmly when the call connected, as if he had been waiting for me all along.

The next morning, we brought our documents to the marriage registry. And just like that, I became Mrs. Vittorio.

Yesterday, I moved into Marco's apartment at Casanova Residence—a luxury building I'd only ever walked past, never imagining I'd live there. Marco guided me through the marble lobby, his hand possessively at the small of my back.

“Do you like it?” he asked, unbuttoning the top two buttons of his shirt and leaning casually against the sofa.

“Uh… it’s nice, just a bit, well, too big, don’t you think?” I forced a smile, while internally screaming, “This isn’t an apartment, it’s practically a palace!”

Marco suddenly leaned in close, his voice low as he suggested, “Since we’re husband and wife, there are certain things we naturally should do. What do you think?”

His breath brushed against me, and my face turned as red as a boiled shrimp. I quickly waved my hands in protest.

“I'm sorry, it's my dangerous period today, and I'm not feeling well.…” I knew my excuse was flimsy at best, but I just wasn’t used to this sudden intimacy.

Instead of disappointment, understanding crossed his features. Then, with a voice that sent shivers down my spine, he'd suggested: ""If you can't use your body, you could use your mouth.""

I pressed against his chest, ""Marco, no.""

""Isn't it natural for a wife to serve her husband?""

Marco’s lips curled into a meaningful, wicked smirk.

""How about I help you with my hands?""

""No, I want it right now.""

In the next second, Marco pressed me down between his legs.

I was forced to take his penis in my mouth and move back and forth, a wave of unbearable nausea washing over me, almost making me gag. But Marco's hand didn't stop, leaving me no chance to even catch my breath.

His thick penis thrust faster, and as I choked, tears started streaming down my face.

Until the phone on the bedside table vibrated.

My heart sank, and my movements halted.

Marco’s fingers traced along my back, ""Keep licking.""

One hand held the phone while the other slipped into my chest, kneading my sensitive nipples relentlessly.

His touch made my whole body tremble. I couldn’t make a sound, only able to continue licking.

Marco squinted in pleasure, the strength in his hand increasing.

I don’t know how much time passed before Marco suddenly paused. With a forceful push on my head, I felt like my throat was about to burst, retching uncontrollably.

He let out a low growl and finally released his grip. I tried to dodge, but the sticky semen still shot onto my face and hair.

Alia POV

""Alia! What are you doing?!"" A sharp female voice yanked me back from my reverie. I looked up abruptly and saw Sofia Monica, the PR department manager, standing in front of me with a dark expression, glaring at me.

""S-Sorry, Manager Monica..."" I quickly lowered my head, fumbling to organize the documents on the table. As an intern from San Luca University, being able to work at Cortese Tech was already an incredible stroke of luck, not to mention that I was assigned to assist in the PR department. But this morning, I spaced out and got caught red-handed—how utterly embarrassing.

Monica snorted coldly, pointing toward the company’s reception area and ordering, ""Everyone, be on your A-game. Today’s press conference has to be flawless. The new CEO, Mr. Vittorio, is about to make his official debut. Anyone who messes up will face the consequences!""

New CEO? Vittorio? My hand trembled, nearly dropping the water glass I’d just picked up. Why did that name sound so familiar? Wait, it couldn’t be…

A tense atmosphere permeated the air. Monica, with a stern face, walked up to me.

""Alia, I’ve heard you’re the most outstanding intern in our company. Later, you’ll be by the new CEO’s side, responsible for assisting with all his needs during the reception.""

I nodded, trying hard to suppress the panic rising inside me, forcing a professional smile. ""Yes, Monica, I’ll do my best.""

""Oh my God, why Alia? She’s just an intern, can she even handle it?"" Colleagues whispered among themselves.

Camilla, standing nearby, leaned over and lightly poked my shoulder with her finger, painted with bright red nail polish.

""Alia, you’re dressed so flashy today. Are you planning to throw yourself at the new CEO?""

I rolled my eyes, wishing I could shove Camilla’s smug face straight into the coffee machine.

""Camilla, is gossip the only thing in your head? This is professional attire, got it?""

‘Come on, I’m just wearing a slightly fitted white blouse and a black pencil skirt. How is that flashy?’

Monica shot Camilla a cold glance. ""Today is critical for all of our jobs. I expect everyone to maintain a professional attitude."" Her gaze carried a clear warning, and Camilla immediately shut her mouth, though reluctance still lingered in her eyes.

I took a deep breath, adjusted the silk scarf around my neck, and tried to make myself look less nervous.

‘Alia, you’ve got this. It’s just assisting a new boss, not defusing a bomb.’

…

The atmosphere in the reception hall grew increasingly oppressive as everyone whispered among themselves. The sudden change in CEO was like a bombshell dropped into a calm lake, without even a hint of prior warning.

Who was the new CEO? What was his background? No one knew. I stood at the edge of the crowd, my fingers unconsciously twisting the corner of my folder, staring curiously at the entrance door just like everyone else.

""The CEO’s convoy has arrived. The board members and the new CEO are about to enter the building,"" a security guard’s low voice crackled through the intercom. The entire reception area fell silent instantly, everyone straightening their backs as if welcoming an emperor’s arrival.

My heart raced even faster, my palms starting to sweat. ‘Don’t chicken out, Elia. This is your chance to shine.’ I gritted my teeth, clutching the folder tighter, my eyes locked on the glass doors.

The doors slowly swung open, and a group of people in suits walked in. The man at the forefront was tall and imposing, his deep blue custom-tailored suit accentuating his perfect physique. His steps were steady and powerful, each one exuding an innate authority. Platinum-framed glasses sat on his sharp nose bridge, his cold, chiseled face looking like it had stepped out of a Renaissance sculpture.

A wave of murmurs spread around me. I looked up and saw a tall, familiar figure leading the group.

‘Impossible!’

In that moment, my brain completely shut down, leaving me with only one thought: ""Dear God, my husband Marco is the company CEO?""

My eyes widened in shock, my heart feeling as if someone had squeezed it tightly. My mind exploded with a loud buzz, and I froze in place.

""No way!"" I blurted out involuntarily. Though my voice was soft, in this pin-drop silence, it still drew a few sideways glances.

I quickly lowered my head, frantically pinching my arm to calm myself. ‘Ouch! Not a dream! It’s really Marco! How could he be the new CEO? I told him I intern at Cortess, but he never mentioned any connection to this company!’

Marco’s gaze lingered on me for a brief moment, his deep, night-like eyes showing no emotion before coldly shifting away. He continued speaking in a low voice with the board members beside him, as if I were just an insignificant passerby.

‘Is he pretending not to know me?’ My mind was a chaotic mess, a strange, bitter feeling welling up inside me.

Monica’s voice suddenly rang in my ear, low and stern. ""Alia, do you realize what occasion this is? Do you know what you’re doing?""

""Sorry, Monica, I… I’ll be more careful."" I hurriedly composed myself, lowering my head to hide my flustered state, though my hands trembled uncontrollably. ‘Calm down. If he doesn’t want to reveal our relationship, he must have his reasons. Right now, you’re an intern, not his wife.’

…

The press conference that followed was pure torture.

I followed Marco into the banquet hall, carrying a thick stack of company reports and press conference materials, taking each step with caution, terrified of making another mistake.

""CEO, these are the financial reports for this quarter and today’s speech draft."" I tried to keep my voice steady as I handed over the documents.

However, perhaps due to nerves, my fingers slipped, and several pages slid out of the folder, scattering across the floor.

""Damn it…"" I muttered under my breath, quickly bending down to pick up the fallen papers.

Just then, a long, strong hand reached over, effortlessly gathering a few sheets and handing them to me.

I looked up and met Marco’s deep, penetrating eyes.

He leaned down close, his low voice brushing against my ear like a feather teasing my nerves. ""Clumsy hands, not great technique. We’ll practice more when we get home tonight.""

His tone carried a hint of mockery, even laced with a touch of ambiguity.

My face flushed bright red in an instant, and I froze on the spot, completely at a loss for words.

‘What does he mean by practicing more at home tonight? Is this guy flirting with me in public?’ My heart pounded wildly, almost leaping out of my throat, while he had already straightened up, casually adjusting his cufflinks and resuming his conversation with others as if nothing had happened.

A few curious glances turned our way. I quickly lowered my head, pretending to be busy as I clumsily gathered the remaining documents.

‘Oh my God, Marco, what are you trying to do? One moment you’re cold as ice, the next you’re teasing me. My heart can’t handle this kind of rollercoaster!’

…

The press conference finally concluded successfully, and I let out a long sigh of relief, feeling the weight on my shoulders lighten a bit.

People started leaving the banquet hall in small groups. I was about to ask Monica for permission to return to my department when Camilla blocked my path.

With her arms crossed and a mocking smile on her face, she said, ""Alia, earlier when you ‘accidentally’ dropped those files, you sure managed to catch the attention of our handsome CEO.""

Her tone was so sour it could drip vinegar, especially when she dragged out the word ""attention,"" making my teeth itch with irritation. I didn’t bother giving her a second glance and walked past her toward Monica. ""Manager Monica, may I return to my post now?""

Camilla clearly hadn’t expected me to be so dismissive. Her expression stiffened for a moment, a flash of anger in her eyes.

""Alia is just here to help temporarily. Stop stirring up trouble,"" Monica said, frowning at Camilla with clear impatience in her tone. Then she turned to me and nodded. ""You can go back. You did well today.""

""Thank you."" I gave a small smile and turned to leave, completely ignoring Camilla, who looked like she was about to explode with frustration behind me.

After a few steps, I heard Camilla mutter under her breath, ""Cousin, I get it.""

‘Cousin? So they’re related. No wonder I always felt something off about their dynamic.’ I thought to myself but didn’t dwell on it. Today had already given me enough headaches.

Especially Marco’s comment about my ""poor technique"" and ""practicing more at home tonight""—it kept replaying in my mind, making my cheeks burn again and again.",1,1753457757.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

His touch made my whole body tremble. I couldn’t make a sound, only able to continue licking.

Marco squinted in pleasure, the strength in his hand increasing.

I don’t know how much time passed before Marco suddenly paused. With a forceful push on my head, I felt like my throat was about to burst, retching uncontrollably.

He let out a low growl and finally released his grip. I tried to dodge, but the sticky semen still shot onto my face and hair.

Alia POV

""Alia! What are you doing?!"" A sharp female voice yanked me back from my reverie. I looked up abruptly and saw Sofia Monica, the PR department manager, standing in front of me with a dark expression, glaring at me.

""S-Sorry, Manager Monica..."" I quickly lowered my head, fumbling to organize the documents on the table. As an intern from San Luca University, being able to work at Cortese Tech was already an incredible stroke of luck, not to mention that I was assigned to assist in the PR department. But this morning, I spaced out and got caught red-handed—how utterly embarrassing.

Monica snorted coldly, pointing toward the company’s reception area and ordering, ""Everyone, be on your A-game. Today’s press conference has to be flawless. The new CEO, Mr. Vittorio, is about to make his official debut. Anyone who messes up will face the consequences!""

New CEO? Vittorio? My hand trembled, nearly dropping the water glass I’d just picked up. Why did that name sound so familiar? Wait, it couldn’t be…

A tense atmosphere permeated the air. Monica, with a stern face, walked up to me.

""Alia, I’ve heard you’re the most outstanding intern in our company. Later, you’ll be by the new CEO’s side, responsible for assisting with all his needs during the reception.""

I nodded, trying hard to suppress the panic rising inside me, forcing a professional smile. ""Yes, Monica, I’ll do my best.""

""Oh my God, why Alia? She’s just an intern, can she even handle it?"" Colleagues whispered among themselves.

Camilla, standing nearby, leaned over and lightly poked my shoulder with her finger, painted with bright red nail polish.

""Alia, you’re dressed so flashy today. Are you planning to throw yourself at the new CEO?""

I rolled my eyes, wishing I could shove Camilla’s smug face straight into the coffee machine.

""Camilla, is gossip the only thing in your head? This is professional attire, got it?""

‘Come on, I’m just wearing a slightly fitted white blouse and a black pencil skirt. How is that flashy?’

Monica shot Camilla a cold glance. ""Today is critical for all of our jobs. I expect everyone to maintain a professional attitude."" Her gaze carried a clear warning, and Camilla immediately shut her mouth, though reluctance still lingered in her eyes.

I took a deep breath, adjusted the silk scarf around my neck, and tried to make myself look less nervous.

‘Alia, you’ve got this. It’s just assisting a new boss, not defusing a bomb.’

…

The atmosphere in the reception hall grew increasingly oppressive as everyone whispered among themselves. The sudden change in CEO was like a bombshell dropped into a calm lake, without even a hint of prior warning.

Who was the new CEO? What was his background? No one knew. I stood at the edge of the crowd, my fingers unconsciously twisting the corner of my folder, staring curiously at the entrance door just like everyone else.

""The CEO’s convoy has arrived. The board members and the new CEO are about to enter the building,"" a security guard’s low voice crackled through the intercom. The entire reception area fell silent instantly, everyone straightening their backs as if welcoming an emperor’s arrival.

My heart raced even faster, my palms starting to sweat. ‘Don’t chicken out, Elia. This is your chance to shine.’ I gritted my teeth, clutching the folder tighter, my eyes locked on the glass doors.

The doors slowly swung open, and a group of people in suits walked in. The man at the forefront was tall and imposing, his deep blue custom-tailored suit accentuating his perfect physique. His steps were steady and powerful, each one exuding an innate authority. Platinum-framed glasses sat on his sharp nose bridge, his cold, chiseled face looking like it had stepped out of a Renaissance sculpture.

A wave of murmurs spread around me. I looked up and saw a tall, familiar figure leading the group.

‘Impossible!’

In that moment, my brain completely shut down, leaving me with only one thought: ""Dear God, my husband Marco is the company CEO?""

My eyes widened in shock, my heart feeling as if someone had squeezed it tightly. My mind exploded with a loud buzz, and I froze in place.

""No way!"" I blurted out involuntarily. Though my voice was soft, in this pin-drop silence, it still drew a few sideways glances.

I quickly lowered my head, frantically pinching my arm to calm myself. ‘Ouch! Not a dream! It’s really Marco! How could he be the new CEO? I told him I intern at Cortess, but he never mentioned any connection to this company!’

Marco’s gaze lingered on me for a brief moment, his deep, night-like eyes showing no emotion before coldly shifting away. He continued speaking in a low voice with the board members beside him, as if I were just an insignificant passerby.

‘Is he pretending not to know me?’ My mind was a chaotic mess, a strange, bitter feeling welling up inside me.

Monica’s voice suddenly rang in my ear, low and stern. ""Alia, do you realize what occasion this is? Do you know what you’re doing?""

""Sorry, Monica, I… I’ll be more careful."" I hurriedly composed myself, lowering my head to hide my flustered state, though my hands trembled uncontrollably. ‘Calm down. If he doesn’t want to reveal our relationship, he must have his reasons. Right now, you’re an intern, not his wife.’

…

The press conference that followed was pure torture.

I followed Marco into the banquet hall, carrying a thick stack of company reports and press conference materials, taking each step with caution, terrified of making another mistake.

""CEO, these are the financial reports for this quarter and today’s speech draft."" I tried to keep my voice steady as I handed over the documents.

However, perhaps due to nerves, my fingers slipped, and several pages slid out of the folder, scattering across the floor.

""Damn it…"" I muttered under my breath, quickly bending down to pick up the fallen papers.

Just then, a long, strong hand reached over, effortlessly gathering a few sheets and handing them to me.

I looked up and met Marco’s deep, penetrating eyes.

He leaned down close, his low voice brushing against my ear like a feather teasing my nerves. ""Clumsy hands, not great technique. We’ll practice more when we get home tonight.""

His tone carried a hint of mockery, even laced with a touch of ambiguity.

My face flushed bright red in an instant, and I froze on the spot, completely at a loss for words.

‘What does he mean by practicing more at home tonight? Is this guy flirting with me in public?’ My heart pounded wildly, almost leaping out of my throat, while he had already straightened up, casually adjusting his cufflinks and resuming his conversation with others as if nothing had happened.

A few curious glances turned our way. I quickly lowered my head, pretending to be busy as I clumsily gathered the remaining documents.

‘Oh my God, Marco, what are you trying to do? One moment you’re cold as ice, the next you’re teasing me. My heart can’t handle this kind of rollercoaster!’

…

The press conference finally concluded successfully, and I let out a long sigh of relief, feeling the weight on my shoulders lighten a bit.

People started leaving the banquet hall in small groups. I was about to ask Monica for permission to return to my department when Camilla blocked my path.

With her arms crossed and a mocking smile on her face, she said, ""Alia, earlier when you ‘accidentally’ dropped those files, you sure managed to catch the attention of our handsome CEO.""

Her tone was so sour it could drip vinegar, especially when she dragged out the word ""attention,"" making my teeth itch with irritation. I didn’t bother giving her a second glance and walked past her toward Monica. ""Manager Monica, may I return to my post now?""

Camilla clearly hadn’t expected me to be so dismissive. Her expression stiffened for a moment, a flash of anger in her eyes.

""Alia is just here to help temporarily. Stop stirring up trouble,"" Monica said, frowning at Camilla with clear impatience in her tone. Then she turned to me and nodded. ""You can go back. You did well today.""

""Thank you."" I gave a small smile and turned to leave, completely ignoring Camilla, who looked like she was about to explode with frustration behind me.

After a few steps, I heard Camilla mutter under her breath, ""Cousin, I get it.""

‘Cousin? So they’re related. No wonder I always felt something off about their dynamic.’ I thought to myself but didn’t dwell on it. Today had already given me enough headaches.

Especially Marco’s comment about my ""poor technique"" and ""practicing more at home tonight""—it kept replaying in my mind, making my cheeks burn again and again.",1,1753457700.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1m92chz,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthemapsedge/comments/1m92chz/a_few_hints_and_helps_for_everyone/,A few hints and helps for everyone.,"In a few weeks I'm going to go take a look in the general area where I think the treasure might be and when I get back, almost certainly without the treasure, I'll post everything I think I've figured out to help all of you as I'll have had my fun with this and will move on with my life (lol)........but in the meantime, a few things I've not seen posted (though they may have been).

Justin's map had 3 things of note.   (1) - Oregon is the only state without its capital on his map.   Oregon is also mentioned in the caption of the picture with his brothers where he mentions that trip being one of his fondest memories.    (2) - Saguaro National Park is shown west of Tucson (which is correct), though in the book he talks about Saguaro National Park East and its renaming from a National Monument.

The third thing on his map is in regards to the mountain peaks of each state.   He includes the tallest peaks in most states, but not California. Instead of Mt. Whitney, he includes Mt Shasta.  Humm.   In Nevada, Boundary Peak is correct, but an interesting fact is that it is a sub peak of Montgomery Peak, which is just ""beyond the map's edge"" of Nevada in California.  I don't think it's a clue, but for anyone who does, enjoy!   Alaska has nearly 10 peaks shown, including Denali, the tallest and is the only state with more than one peak included on his map.  I think he's trying to tell us to ignore Alaska.  Now the big thing to note is in Wyoming.   While he does include Gannett Peak as the tallest, the elevation is completely wrong.  It isn't 7,076 like he shows, it is 13,810.   Have fun with that one folks!

2 Coffee cups - Reminds me of most of the chapters in his book where they have two words beginning with the same letters.   Perhaps he is indicating the poem clues have double meanings.   

In the Chapter about his grandfather, where he loses the tire and it rolls down the hill.   Justin writes.....""There it went, floating downstream, probably dreaming of a new life as a Ferris wheel"".   Not only is ferris wheel a strange description, Ferris is capitalized.     In the Tabacco Root Mountains northeast of Dillon there is a Ferris Peak.   Also in that range and near Ferris Peak is Louise Lake.   You'll remember on one of his screens in Netflix is a picture of Lake Louise in Canada.   This range also contains Granite Mountain at 12,800, which is on his map.

That's all I'm throwing your way until I get back, but I thought those who didn't notice the things I've mentioned might need something new to chase for a while.   And for VariationNo1381, who is absolutely convinced it is in Arizona, I can tell you've spent a lot of time on this, but I'd be greatly surprised if it is in AZ and I wanted to throw out enough to get you looking further north, where it isn't 110 degrees and the bees are of normal size.

And lastly, as a side note, wouldn't it just kill Justin if Jack Stuef was the one who found his treasure.   I mean, we'd all be disappointed it wasn't us, but if it was Jack, Justin would probably hide another treasure just so Jack doesn't beat him for a 3rd time....lol.

I’m doing a good job eating the right foods but what I’m struggling with more is no cold/raw foods. I like my matcha or coffee cold and I like to eat fresh fruit and yogurt especially now since it’s summer. I live in a desert climate where the days are over 100 Fahrenheit. Some of the foods recommended for me to eat more of are cherries, cucumber and citrus, which I like to eat raw. How important is it to only have warm cooked foods? Does that go for all liquids as well? I always start my day with warm lemon water and mineral sea salt. I’m not sure exactly of my diagnosis, but my symptoms are bloating, burping, acne, mild constipation, and very broken sleep patterns. I am on the “curing pills” by the brand plum flower and xiao Yao wan herbs. I am receiving weekly acupuncture as well and doing the daily qi gong exercises she recommended. I am 24f, otherwise healthy with very good habits. These bad symptoms have built over the last few months.

     This thing infuriates me. Feather light tension and it feels like I’m picking in mud with no response. Moderate tension and it grinds more than a diesel powered clock that back fires. Anything more than moderate tension and the pins either don’t move, or explode into being overset. 

     I can get it into a pretty nice false set, but as soon as I apply counter rotation I can feel most of the pins fall back out.

Expenses like branded to-go cups, eco-friendly packaging, and other essentials were eating into my budget, with local suppliers charging premium rates for sustainable materials. My margins were razor-thin, barely covering rent, utilities, and wages for my dedicated team of baristas. I needed a solution to source affordable, high-quality packaging that aligned with my brand’s commitment to sustainability without compromising the customer experience. The pressure to maintain quality while keeping costs manageable was relentless, and I knew I had to think outside the box to keep my business thriving.


Switching to this international supplier on alibaba slashed my packaging costs by an impressive 30%. This significant reduction freed up funds that I reinvested into the business, allowing me to source higher-quality coffee beans from a local roaster and fund barista training in latte art. These improvements elevated the customer experience, leading to glowing reviews and increased loyalty from regulars who appreciated the enhanced quality. To further optimize savings, I negotiated seasonal discounts with the supplier, securing even better rates during peak periods like the holiday season.

I made an ice cream mix or Base yesterday afternoon following the usual instructions:

 I used a store bought premade coffee protein shake. I added two extra shots of espresso. I added about 60 mils of cream. I added half a sachet of pudding mix and a tablespoon of peanutbutter and xylitol. Froze it flat at -14C/6.8F for 22ish hours. 

There was a small bulge in the middle that’s about half a centimetre high that I scraped down with a spoon so everything was perfectly flat again. 

I left it out on the counter for 10 minutes and then put it into the machine. Set the machine on ice cream mode and started it. It was very very loud which was a little bit of a surprise so I turned it off. 

Although many videos of the machine that I’ve watched said it was quite loud I couldn’t tell what was normal and what wasn’t. 

I turned it back on, on light ice cream mode, and let it run a full cycle. There was a strange burning smell coming from what I thought was the machine later I realised it wasn’t from the machine itself. I opened the ice cream pot and the blade was gone.  Later I found it right at the bottom of the ice cream pot. It had done what it was supposed to do. The result was quite powdery, obviously it would have needed to spin it at least once more but from the pictures you can see the result. 

The brown stuff on the blade is burnt ice cream, I suppose, and also the rod that goes into The back of the blade looks sort of damaged and when I rubbed my fingers on it, they come away with black burnt smelling ash. 

The strange thing is the top of the rod as you’ll see in one of the pictures looks rusted.  I’m not sure how that could have happened perhaps it’s also just more burnt ART ice cream. I really don’t know, No ice cream or any liquid came out of the tub, nothing leaked.

Since I was denied the closure, I can't help but talk to myself and replay the things I wanted to say in person, hoping you guys can give your own input if I fucked it up ( which i think ) or it's not meant to be, which is the logic as well..

It was a 1year and two months relationship, we never fought, we only argued rarely, and made up hours or a day later, disagreeing on something, pretty normal..

I can safely say that I had girlfriends before but never lasted more than 3 months because I never fell in love before this time, she was the one for me, I loved everything about her and my intentions were always pure, I saw her wifey material.

I only moved to the states almost 2 years now so my culture is a bit different how we say things that sometimes can be offensive in other places..  
For example one of the times i was making fun of how Japanese people speak english, and she didn't like it, because she said it's racist but I have an accent too, not Japanese but it's obvious .. I'm brown it's okay i like dark humor, if a comedian jokes bout my kind i find it funny most of the time.. we don't get offended if it's comedy and meant to be humorous and not attacking u know..  
But she gets tense if i joke something like that...  
But anyways this is not about dark humor ..  
She always had an insecurity and told me about it, about her weight and how she struggled with it during high school and stuff..  
When i met her she looked the same as she is now..  
So i obviously like the way she looks and i don't find her fat or anything, i mean how can you spend a year and always attracted to someone and we had great sex life, like sooo fucking good always fucking like rabbits , she turns me on all the time

So sometimes if the subject of body comes up i'm like just being myself and i sometimes say that i like skinny figures, i think i did it twice or something and she'd get uncomfortable and I assure her that it doesn't matter because it's like something unnecessary, just like a preference that way on the top of the cake and she's not fat at all, however, my definition of things sometimes can be different from someone's definition of the same thing.. pretty normal, no?

Especially with her, I sometimes see her as chubby, according to my own definition, but sometimes she seems not chubby, idk what is it hormones or god knows, i'm not so experienced with long relationship so my communication wasn't the best when it comes to something sensitive, i would talk to her as if i talk to my best friend, and i thought that's fine, because u know, she's also my best friend, but now i learned that it's not the way to talk to your girlfriend , the emotional aspect should be on top rather than logic

so recently she got some bad test cholesterol results and stuff, that she needed to move and do some workout, she got to the gym and was working out, this happened over text, because we didn't live together, but we see each other a lot she wasn't far.

So we were talking about the exercises and stuff and i gave her some tips and ideas etc, she said she's not looking to lose weight she's feeling okay as she is, and my stupid ass was not okay with that response, I was like, why not, you could use some weight loss , and i said it in a very dramatic way, i mentioned that one day i was crying because i thought about it ( her sometimes looking unattractive because of that ) and i felt bad because my brain generated that idea and that's why i was crying, because i love her and i didn't care that much about it, it was just a stupid idea that bothered me and it made me feel like an asshole, so i told her all of this, something like ""I love you, you could use some weight and you'll be a 11/10 since you're already a 10""

and saying this, where i come from is not a big deal, because If she told me the same, i would agree with her, in fact i always told her i'm also insecure about my ""chicken legs"" and i do my best to work them out, etc , i always joke about it, even my friends roast me about them.

if i say something like that it means i do want to be with you at all times and this thing will help you, but do it or not, it's just a suggestion, not an order.

once i sent the audios, I knew something bad will happen, i regretted it immediately, that wasn't smart, not only that but it didn't really matter to me, I do love her the way she is, why did I say that? it felt like somebody spoke on my behalf for a second , literally ! she's not even chubby, wtf did i say!

Then she went silent for 3 days, the longest we ever went silent, 4th day she came to breakup with me in person.  
She cried and cried, I cried like there's no tomorrow, my heart was physically aching me to see her aching, the pain i cause her hurt me more than her leaving me, her face was so innocent and so hurt .ç

she was saying, "" I didn't know that's how you looked at me all this time""

I tried to explain my intention was not so bad, but she was too emotional to listen, we cried, she hugged me and said i love you but i can't be with someone who will always feel like i'm not enough for him, and left..

i think 4 days later, i texted her and said i miss her and i want to explain myself, so i called her, video call

I spoke well, i said how much i love her and can't be with someone for more than a year that i'm not physically attracted to, and she knows that she's the first one i fall in love with truly and not just date and move on..

In that video call she was calm, we shared good memories and we cried remembering them, and i thought there was hope there, like i felt heard and she listened and believed me

at least it's what i thought, but side story, she got 3 friends of hers who didn't really like me, one of them always wanted to be a throuple with us,

the other was jealous because she used to spend more time with her, and the third one didn't like my views on some things, cultural or whatever..

and one sister of hers she's the type who said no to a good guy, to go back dating and hitting a new record of fucking around, like 16 in a week or some shit, so of course she's not so much into serious relationship, unlike my ex.. so ofc she wouldn't back me up.. none of these surroundings of hers,

so i think that really influenced her too on top of what i said, after the call, she still didn't say anything, we didn't chat, she asked for space and i gave it to her.

i had some work close to her house, so I went there, put flowers and a card on her door. went to work it was 2 hours and i went back to her door to see if she'd taken them

I also haven't seen her since the breakup night when she came to see me, so i wanted to say hi in person, talk for like 5 mins and give her her space back, just to remember my smell and I hers and make sure she got the flowers..

her roommate opened the door said she was in a bar downstairs with another friend of hers, i was walking there and saw both of them coming out , that friend of hers who wanted to be a throuple with us was like, OH noo what are you doing, don't... blabla and i'm like,, whaT? wtf?

why is she even talking to me, she wasn't in a relationship with us, im here to see my gf and talk to her for 5 mins, please leave us alone, you have nothing to do with this..

my ex wasn't defending me, so i was pissed, i came from another city, she's 1hrs away from me, brining flowers, wanting to talk for a short time in person, and what i get is rejection? to even talk?

so she was giving me this look and i didn't feel respected, so i walked away to my car and drove

she texted me and said please go home and drive safely, which pissed me off even more, oh, she actually said, she felt unsafe cause it was all of a sudden.

I'm like, wtf wym unsafe? you literally just told me last week you feel the safest with me!  
And i'm not a physical person i don't even yell at her, how could she say something like that? I felt so disrespected and angry and sad.

i'm doing something romantic, apologizing, trying my best to fix it, and what i get?

so i went back, i texted her of how i was disappointed and mad, she apologized for her friend who shouldn't interfere and said that she didn't mean it that way, just it was shocking for her etc..  
then she again asked for space, and i'm like , how do i know if i should give her space or show how much i care, and how sorry i am ? where's the f\*\*\* line, it's so thin i can't see it!!

So i gave her another week, nothing, no texts no i miss you nothing, and i'm tearing my head and bones in my room barely eating .

just need to talk to her in person and see what she thinks, because so far we haven't , since the breakup which already wasn't clear, it was all crying and short phrases, not like an adult talk and listening to each other..

so i felt so unheard and i felt as if her silence was a call for attention.. she didn't say anything, she didn't block my number, still follows my instagram, sees my stories... but no words

so i'm like, maybe i should do more showing??

I wrote her the most romantic letter, I bought the tools, the victorian ink, i made papers look old with coffee, i made a custom seal , i made the envelope myself, i drove there, in the rain and storm, put it in her reception and left, didn't want to show my face just in case she's still disgusted by me.

the letter said the things i love about her and how it's illogical for me to mean what she interpreted, that night i was expecting a text, at least saying that she got it..

nothing, the next day, nothing

the next day nothing, 3rd day or 4th, she texted

at the time i was already so disappointed, this is not the person i know..  
i haven't cheated... all of this became overreaction to me!

at least acknowledge my letter that day or the next morning, not ignore my efforts like i'm nobody..we didn't date for 1 month, we shared way too much  
her text was :

"" hey  
thank you for the letter, it’s very thoughtful and it means a lot to me  
i’m still in a place where i need space, so i’m not ready for a conversation right now. i hope you can understand that this is something i need in order to take care of myself and process everything fully  
i will reach out when i feel ready. i hope you’re taking care of yourself""

all i replied with was a thumb up reaction.  
but inside of me I had a sea of words to say to her,  
but I understood that it becomes unattractive to be pushy, so I did as she said.. and to this day she didn't reach out..

there's that part on instagram reels where i could see what she ""likes"" of reels, and seems to me as if she knows that i see them...  
it was one reel about how you don't see red flags in a person when you're with them etc

another was about how somebody could show their love until it's too late, which is not true in my case, i've always bought her gifts and went out, but as she mentioned one time on valentine's day, she expected more than the roses and card i wrote her, she said it was effortless.. If i was rich i would have taken her somewhere nice, but especially at the time she knew i was struggling financially yet i do what i can..

Now 2 months later, i'm thinking if she went back to all the little arguments we had and made a big deal out of them, or the fact that i'm not financially stable, on top of triggering her insecurity, i keep thinking if it was someone else would this be a deal breaker ? i know i hurt her and i still regret what i said, I don't even mean it, i didn't know where it came from, i'm a human, we fuck up, I apologized, I still love her as she is. I can't move on and I can't forgive myself yet.

Many of my close friends, who are not actually biased, told me that She could be mad but breaking up and not wanting to talk to in person is disrespectful to a real relationship that lasted 1.2 year between 2 adults..

I guess i just need more time, since i'm not used to being so in love then losing it..",1,1753457491.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1m929jf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m929jf,Lens of Empathy: Framed feelings. Captured care. A shared way of seeing.,"This series collects moments where empathy rises in small gestures, unexpected connections, and quiet tenderness. No perfection. Just presence.

1. **Through Her Eyes**  
A granddaughter gently adjusts the focus on her vintage camera. In the lens, her elderly grandmother’s younger self flickers back into view — a reflection of memory, legacy, and love.

2. **The Mirror Between Us**  
Two friends sit on opposite sides of a rain-streaked café window. One is crying, the other smiling — their hands pressed against the glass in mirrored compassion.

3. **Eyes Closed, Heart Open**  
A blind man and his guide dog pause on a crowded sidewalk. A child reaches out in awe and trust, their fingertips meeting in stillness while the world rushes by.

4. **A Life in One Glance**  
A second moment on the porch. The girl’s camera captures not just her grandmother — but the lives she’s lived, the family she’s held, and the weight of her years.

5. **The Granola Bar**  
On a dim school bus, a boy fights tears alone — until someone silently offers him a granola bar. No words. Just kindness, passed hand to hand.

6. **The Care We Don’t Post**  
In a quiet kitchen, a woman clips her father’s nails. Pill bottles, coffee, crossword puzzle — it’s not glamorous, but it’s love in its rawest form.

7. **Missed Call from “Home”**  
A girl sits on the edge of her bed, the phone glowing beside her. She doesn’t answer. Not tonight. But the ache in her posture says everything.

8. **Porch Rain Silence**  
Two sisters, wrapped in a blanket on a rainy porch. Neither speaks. They just sit in it together — whatever “it” is.

9. **Offering Softness Anyway**  
An older man with closed eyes. A guide dog steady at his side. A child standing close, unsure but brave — offering softness anyway.

1m92963,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m92963/aita_for_interfering_with_a_situation_i_thought/,"AITA for interfering with a situation I thought was dangerous, but turned out not to be?","This morning my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a McDonalds breakfast and Starbucks. When we pulled up to the drive through there was an older man sitting outside the store wearing cowboy boots and basketball shorts with no shirt on. We live in a mid-sized town in the south, and homelessness and/or drug addiction is not uncommon. So, I admit, I assumed based off of his attire and body language that something like that was the case. We left, picked up our coffees, and headed home. When we were driving back that way, I saw the same man following a young (early 20s), fully clothed, white woman about 15 steps behind. In my view, it didn’t look like she knew him. She kept glancing behind and around, and he was following behind talking on speakerphone. I asked my husband to turn the car around because I wanted to make sure she was okay. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. I wasn’t thinking about how it would look to them, I was just completely focused on making sure she was okay. So I had my husband pull the car over and I walked up and asked her. They were both very offended, and the man said “what, because she’s with a black man?” Which wasn’t it at all, but in hindsight I can totally see why he thought that. I feel terrible for having offended them, and now I feel like I should’ve just minded my business. But my husband said I didn’t do anything wrong, and that if she had been in danger it would’ve been good that I was there. I just feel conflicted, and embarrassed, and like I should’ve just minded my own business. I was just trying to make sure she was safe, but I think I might’ve just made an ass of myself. For context, my husband and I are both white and from the south. We’re liberal, and try our hardest to educate ourselves and act with respect and compassion for everyone. But I’m completely prepared to admit that I messed up and learn from this if I did handle this incorrectly. I know I had the best intentions at heart, but I could also just have more to learn. 

Be honest with me, Reddit. Is this a case of me trying to do the right thing and getting it wrong, or do I have biases that I need to confront? Or maybe both. ",5,1753457409.0,AmItheAsshole,18,0.73,False

1m9259e,https://www.reddit.com/r/LandlordLove/comments/1m9259e/my_landlord_began_harassing_me_this_year/,My landlord began harassing me this year,"For 4 years, I rented a room in a house from a private landlord. The rental was supposed to be short-term, but I changed my mind since the location was quaint, walkable, and quiet. The landlord originally left me alone for years, which was great. I was the perfect tenant - never brought anyone over, didn’t make much noise, and always paid rent on time. 

In January 2025, things changed. My landlord said his ex-wife, who lived on the property but never interacted with me since I had my own entrance, was missing. (The landlord did not live on the property himself.) When I saw him in person, I told him that if he made missing person flyers, I’d help hand them out. He never made the flyers, but later that night, he texted me asking to go out to dinner, which I declined. It irked me, but I brushed it off since his ex-wife was found soon after. I was later told she befriended homeless people and ran off with them. 

Weeks later, he said the property I was renting was being sold and I’d have to move out later this year, but he had a second property I could live in. Curious, I went to see the second property in person. To my surprise, it was a dilapidated trailer park. The juxtaposition between the place I currently lived in and this second property was jarring and confusing. He bragged about how an elderly woman was begging to move in, as if it were a hot commodity, but that he’d give me first dibs. To this day, I don’t believe that woman existed. 

Days later, he asked if I wanted to move to that property. I declined. For 1.5 months, he texted me weekly, plotting different ways to convince me, such as lowering the rent, offering to cover moving costs, or reminding me how safe I’d be there. I always said no in the nicest way possible to decrease potential harm as a female tenant. When he suggested I sell most of my belongings to fit into the small trailer and to see the property for a second time, I stopped responding. His texts began to feel sinister. Why was “no” never enough? He knew I was pulling away and began texting, “I await your response.” 

His obsession grew. 

May 5th, the AC technician needed to enter my unit to fix the AC. I’m normally not home for this, but I was healing from a CO2 laser, so I locked myself in the bathroom without telling my landlord. While the AC tech was in the attic, my landlord tried two times to open the locked bathroom door, even pushing on the door and using random keys that didn’t work. I stayed quiet and had a panic attack.

I put my ear to the door and heard a can crack open, which was my canned coffee. Then I heard a loud zipper opening, which was my purse. Thankfully, I had my valuables, like my wallet, with me inside the bathroom. Once I heard the purse open, I knew I had to stop him. I opened the door and told him to stop going through my belongings. He angrily asked, “What are you doing in there?” I caught him going through one of my storage boxes. He left. Minutes later, he came back, trying to distract me by saying his ex-wife was missing again, probably hoping I’d leap up like Superwoman and offer to help. I shut the door and said nothing.

Twenty minutes later, he texted me saying he was simply looking for pen and paper, which was a cover-up lie. I didn’t respond. I didn’t call the police because I doubted they’d believe me due to a past traumatic experience with the local police, so I didn’t want to risk the landlord’s retaliation. Plus, the lease was ending soon, and I didn’t want to be tied to him through a lengthy court process that could bear no fruit. If he lived in a trailer park, did he have money to take in a court settlement? I had only learned recently that he did not own the house I lived in and was subleasing it. After the incident, I installed a Ring camera in my room and placed security signs near the entrance.

At the worst possible time, I was contractually obligated to submit the final lump sum rent payment just days after the incident. We didn’t have a formal lease, just through text, which is still legally enforceable. I transferred the last payment, thinking this was the end and he’d leave me alone. 

An hour after I transferred the final payment, the landlord knocked on my front door, but I ignored it. He then texted me asking what he had to say to make me move into the second property. I had already told him “no” more than five times by text. I did not respond. 

Another hour went by, and he became furious. He went from begging me to live with him to suddenly terrorizing me. He sent a flood of angry texts demanding all of my bank statements from the last four years. He specifically said he wanted “every transaction,” which felt intrusive and frightening. Was he planning to stalk me at the local spots where I shopped after I moved out? Was his burglary attempt to get my documents for identity theft? The lease was fully paid off, and I was clearly not renewing. He was using any excuse to keep me in his orbit of obsession.

The unread text messages from him grew to at least 20 texts over the span of a few days. I never read those texts, even to this day. I suffered from panic attacks, weight loss, and poor sleep due to the fear of him since May.  

I planned my escape. I ordered a storage unit and slowly moved my items in there myself. For the month and May and June, I was hyper-focused on decluttering and selling my belongings to make my move quicker. I created a nice nest egg of funds to move out. 

Today, I took the plunge and officially moved out. I broke my lease early, lost 2 months of rent money, but I’m safe now! I never told the landlord I was moving out early. The last time I spoke to him was back in May. 

The movers arrived and they swiftly and quietly moved everything out. These movers were such a blessing in this traumatic time. I shared my story with them and they reassured me I am not alone and other positive statements. 

  
When the move was complete, I placed a letter on my door. The letter explained how traumatized I was by the landlord's behavior (asking me to dinner, the burglary, begging me to move in with him when I said no, and the erratic texts demanding all my bank transactions when the lease was fully paid off.) I was hoping the letter would scare him back into not harassing me, as I clearly had leverage against him.  

My only fear now is that the landlord files a lawsuit over damage I did not cause out of retaliation, but I did take move-out videos for my safety. Thankfully, he does not know where I am moving to and I will be moving out of state.

1m921n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatteryHub/comments/1m921n1/explore_the_pchh_bc107_car_battery_charger_review/,Explore the PCHH BC-107 Car Battery Charger Review Is This Worth It?,"The **PCHH BC-107** has been on my radar for a while, so I was pretty excited to get my hands on it for testing. Let’s face it—finding a car battery charger that’s versatile, efficient, and not unnecessarily complicated can be a bit of a treasure hunt. After a couple of months of daily use, I’ve formed some opinions about this heavy-duty battery charger that might help anyone considering it.

**Robust Build and Design That Screams Durability**  
This charger means business, and its design reflects just that. Weighing 12.4 pounds and encased in a combination of metal and ABS casing, it has a reassuring heft to it. This isn’t a flimsy gadget that would struggle with demanding tasks. The orange and black color scheme makes it easy to spot in a cluttered garage (and if you saw mine, you’d understand why that’s so handy). The build exudes durability and feels like it could survive a fair amount of abuse. Plus, the copper coil inside spells efficiency and long life—not just some cheap, plasticky mess.

**Compatibility With a Wide Range of Batteries**  
One feature that stood out right away is its compatibility. Whether it’s AGM, GEL, Wet/Flooded, EFB, Calcium, MF, or deep-cycle batteries, this charger has you covered. I even tested it on an old deep-cycle battery left unused for years—this thing brought it back like some battery whisperer. It’s versatile enough for motorcycles, trucks, cars, and even lawnmowers. It’s honestly been a lifesaver for my collection of random vehicles in various stages of decay.

**See [PCHH BC-107] deals on Amazon now.**  

**Flexible Charging Options That Simplify Everything**  
This battery charger offers two modes: fast charge and trickle charge. Here’s where it gets interesting—it’s smart enough to detect whether you’re dealing with a 12V or 24V battery. Just connect it and forget about it, which has been a breath of fresh air compared to some overly manual chargers I’ve used in the past. The auto shut-off feature is brilliant, cutting off power once your battery is fully charged to prevent overcharging mishaps. As someone who forgets everything (seriously, I’ve left coffee brewing for hours), this feature feels like it was designed for me personally.

**Winter Mode and Beyond**  
I live in a place where winters are no joke, so the winter mode on this charger feels almost essential. It provides a robust, complete charge even when temperatures dip below freezing. I can’t stress enough how beneficial this has been for getting my car to start on frosty mornings. The intuitive LCD screen takes things a step further by clearly displaying crucial charging details like percentage, voltage, and current. No more guessing games or squinting at tiny lights! 

**Best Features that Caught My Eye**  
- Automatically detects 12V and 24V batteries.  
- LCD display shows all the critical charging information.  
- Repair mode effectively revives dead batteries.  
- Winter mode for optimal charging during cold weather.  
- Doubles as a 12V power supply for other tools.  

**Safety is Not Just a Buzzword Here**  
I noticed right off the bat that this charger takes safety seriously. It includes short circuit, reverse polarity, overcharge, overheat, and overcurrent protection. During testing, I intentionally connected the clamps the wrong way (don’t do this at home) just to see how it would react. The charger stopped immediately, as advertised. Knowing there’s a built-in system to keep everything in check is a comforting feature, especially for less tech-savvy users. The three-year warranty provides additional peace of mind, too.

**Areas That Could Be Improved**  
However, no product is without its quirks:  
- At 12.4 pounds, it’s hardly what you’d call lightweight. While the weight adds durability, it does make portability less convenient.  
- The manual could use better organization. I had to dig around a bit just to find some of the more advanced setup instructions. A clearer guide would’ve been a nice touch.  
- The fan can get a bit noisy during extended usage sessions. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it’s worth noting if you’re someone who values quiet operation.  

**Competitors and How They Stack Up**  
Though this charger is undeniably impressive, it’s worth comparing to other products. For instance, the Schumacher SC1280 is another 12V/24V charger in a similar price range. While the Schumacher is more portable and slightly lighter, it tends to lack the same rugged durability that the PCHH BC-107 offers. On the other hand, NOCO’s Genius10 charger has a sleeker design but is more suited for casual users. The PCHH BC-107, by contrast, shines in heavy-duty and versatile applications, making it a better choice if you need a workhorse. 

**True Value for the Features Offered**  
The real selling point for me was the sheer versatility combined with ease of use. It might not be the cheapest option out there, but considering how many features I gained—winter mode, repair mode, safety features, and a reliable LCD interface—it feels like money well spent. While pricing can vary, this definitely qualifies as an investment that delivers consistent value over time. No gimmicks, just solid performance.

But I’d been jonesing for more Sebastian Ramirez White Honey Gesha since the end of last year when Day 24 of the Onyx Advent Calendar blew my mind.

Onyx was out and hadn’t seen it anywhere else…until I saw JBC had it. So went to grab 2 bags, saw free shipping came with 3 bags, and I mean…any excuse to buy more coffee right?

I saw they had these two Wilton Benitez’, have heard people raving about him and them forever, and grabbed both bags. 

But damn…every cup I’ve brewed has been pretty bad. The processing funk and harshness is sooooo heavy it overwhelms everything else. —-and I’ve had a subscription to Black & White, love DAK, Nestor Lasso Ombligon is one of my all time favs, etc —- so I do enjoy a lot of experimental, processed and funky coffees.

If ppl have gotten good cups out of these, how? My cups were so unenjoyable I didn’t keep trying. But I’m wondering maybe I just need to go even more ultra course and extra low temps? Is there a way to get nice flavor without that processing harshness coming through?

It’s been working really well and I’ve honestly been enjoying my days more (feels like higher baseline levels of dopamine?) and been getting more stuff done. Other than the obvious things like deleting instagram etc. wanted to share a few things that have helped me a lot and hopefully will help you too.

Morning quiet time. I kick off my day with 5-10 minutes of quiet. Usually just making my coffee and drinking it. No phone usage. I guess this is basically a meditative state. If you have trouble with this I had tried Headspace which most of you probably know. Ideally though I don’t even touch my phone during this time. 

Stick to one task. I’ve been doing timed sprints on just one thing, no distractions. Closing tabs and muting notifications help. Usually I’ll say from now till X AM/PM I’m going to work on some particular thing. I end up having a bunch of these blocks during the day and I get a lot done. 

Reading more. Reading has been huge for training my brain to stay present. One issue I had with this was wasting time on finding stuff to read. I had tried a newspaper subscription (think like ny times, wsj, etc) but that didn’t really work for me. This app ReadLab has been really good for me since it lets you just pick a category you want to read in and it gives you an article. Saves me a lot of time.

Clear space. A cluttered desk messes with my head so I try to keep things clutter free. I definitely notice a correlation between messiness and how frantic I feel.

Tech-free breaks. Instead of scrolling during breaks, I take a short walk , some time sitting and thinking about stuff, or a quick meditation ",5,1753456692.0,productivity,3,1.0,False

1m91vn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1m91vn8/a_number_of_short_stories_i_wrote_for_a/,A number of short stories I wrote for a collection #3,"# The Road Stop









Somewhere there is a road. The road is not a main road, but still, it sees quite a bit of traffic and some time ago an enterprising person built a small shop on the side of the road. A place people can stop on their travels, to rest, eat and relax.

Tonight, the place is nearly empty. Only ten people, counting the staff, are within. Each of them here for a reason. Each of them with a story to tell and none of them aware of this fact. When one of them looks around they see the other patrons, but never gives them more than a moment’s thought. Each of them wrapped up in their own little world and too focused to ever wonder about others, especially some strangers who happen to be in the same place as them.

When I look around I can see all of the stories contained in these people. I can see why they are here and I can tell you.

Sitting at the table near the middle of the shop, where he can easily be seen, is not a man, but a monster. He sips at a cup of coffee acting like he hasn't a care. He stopped here to be seen. He is on his way home from the place where he buried his wife, alive. He doesn't live far down the road and when he reports his wife missing, he'll tell the police he came here for a drink and came home to find her missing. Anyone still here, most likely the staff, will unwittingly corroborate his alibi, and upon being asked will say that he seemed perfectly normal and happy. Not at all like someone who just murdered his wife. He'll get away with it. For a while.

In about two years’ time, however, a man will begin some construction work in the area and dig up his wife. The case will be reopened, and with a body and some DNA evidence on the coffin, he'll finally be brought to justice.

In one corner, there is a woman and a baby. The woman is sitting at the table and the baby is in a stroller. The baby is sleeping peacefully, the woman is drinking the cheapest caffeinated drink the road stop serves. She is harried and frantic and anytime the door opens, or someone moves towards her, she flinches. She refuses to meet anyone's eyes, not that anyone looks towards her anyway. She has not eaten since morning and she will not have a proper meal until at least a day has passed, even then her meal will not consist of much. She has very little money and most of it will be spent on the child. She is fleeing from her home. Her father specifically. Anyone who looked at her would guess she was a mother and the child her daughter, but they are siblings. Half siblings, in fact.

Her mother and father split up nine years ago and she stayed with her father who remarried and had another child, the child now with her. Her new stepmother was a drunk, her father unemployed, with no desire to get a job. His hatred of her, as a constant reminder of his failed relationship, led him to a conclusion as to a source of income. From the moment she turned 16, her father and step mother began to prostitute her out to unscrupulous men for cash. They kept her locked up in the house until she was sold and never allowed her out.

When she turned 18, the new baby was born, as they dealt with the new arrival, their secure hold on her became more lax. Tonight, she managed to escape, taking the new child to both save her, and get back at them. She hopes to get farther away before they awake to find her and the child missing. This stop is unintended, but she overestimated her strength and ability to remain awake. She hopes the caffeine will carry her for a while. She has no real destination, her only hope is to get away and perhaps to find the mother who abandoned her in the past. Her story will not have a happy ending. She will die a slow death on the street, still fleeing, never stopping. The child will be found and inserted into the system as an orphan, it's “mother's” corpse never identified, and the child raised with no known family. Her father and stepmother will search in vain for a while, with no source of income and too involved in their search to realize it, they will slowly lose everything. Their house, their possessions, and soon each other. The stepmother will leave to find another man to support her and the father will die the same way as his daughter. Alone on the streets.

In the other corner is a man in a business suit. He stopped here for a drink on the way to a business deal he fears will go south. His business has been failing as of late and he has no family. He laments the life he has wasted in a career that, as far as he is aware, has dead-ended. He will drink himself into a stupor until the sun comes up and then continue his trip. In his inebriated state, he will never make it to the meeting. Tired and drunk on despair and alcohol, he will veer into oncoming traffic and hit another car at high speed in a head on collision that will send him through his windshield and dash his brains out onto the car with which he collided. It's unfortunate, as the meeting would have ended in a deal that would have turned his company around and led to a long and prosperous string of deals and decisions that would have turned him into a titan of his industry.

At the table closest to the door sits a man with graying hair. He is a priest at a church just a little down the road. He is having a crisis of faith. He has recently gotten word that his son was killed in a random shooting at the college his son was attending in another town. His son being his last living relative, his death was a blow to the priest’s life and faith. Feeling all alone and no longer sure he can follow a god who allowed his son to die, he sits here alone to consider renouncing his faith publicly and leaving the priesthood.

However, it weighs on his mind that he is a pillar of the community. His flock looks to him for comfort and guidance. To publicly renounce his faith would destroy his flock and put their own faiths in jeopardy. He will eventually decide he cannot go down that path. He will resolve to bury his lack of faith and continue playing his role for the good of the community. Throughout his many years of service to come, he will save many others and give them comfort through words that will ring hollow to his own ears. He will die remembered as a bastion of faith and sincerity, the truth buried with his body never to be unearthed.

In the last corner, that is not taken up by the counter, sit a teenaged couple. A boy and a girl. They wish to be married, but the girl is from a family of good breeding and the boy is of common folk. Her parents are big figures in the political world and intend her to marry a member of another political family in order to gain more political sway. They do not approve of the boy. The boy's family does not approve either, as the girl's family is extremely right-wing and the boy’s family are far left. They fear their son is being indoctrinated into the right-wing by the girl, who they assume cannot possibly truly love him. They met here in secret. They both have a plan. The boy wants them to elope, but the girl doesn't think this will work and knows her parents will do whatever it takes to track them down. She has instead come up with her own plan. She intends to propose a murder-suicide pact. Whether he agrees or refuses, she intends to go through with it regardless. She'll go along with his eloping plan and later propose it somewhere when they are alone. He will refuse and she will carry out her plan with only a minor struggle.

When their bodies are found there will be a media uproar. Tales will be spun demonizing the boy and his family as radicals and putting full responsibility for the deaths on the boy. The girl's family will make sure any evidence to the contrary disappears and he will also eventually take the blame for the fire that destroyed the road stop, which occurs the very next day. Society will eventually be swayed and turn on the boy's family, as they grieve for the loss of their son, they will be forced to flee the country for their own safety.

The last patron sits at a table loaded with empty glasses. You'd think he'd be passed out drunk. He probably wishes he was. Unfortunately for him, the drinks were all non-alcoholic. His new wife forbids him to drink. It was a little irritating, but he understood why. He had been a self-destructive alcoholic before he met her and she had turned his life around. He was a better person now and he loved her. He loved her a lot. He fears, however, that he doesn't love her enough. The reason he is here now, downing non-alcoholic fruit drinks and wishing he could miraculously get drunk from pineapple, is the revelation his new wife lay on him earlier that day.

She revealed that he was not in fact her first love. That there had been another shortly before they met. A man who she had been with some time, a man she had loved before him and, most importantly, a man who had died for her.

He had learned about it when they had been talking that morning. The conversation had turned towards previous relationships. Mostly unimportant childhood crushes, in his case a girl he had brought to prom who had turned out to be a terrible person. Eventually, she admitted that there had been one more serious relationship in her life and she had told him the tale.

She had met him in a hospital. She went in for what she had assumed at the time was mild chest pain. The doctors had found nothing wrong and sent her home recommending heartburn medication. It was while she was waiting to be seen that she met him. He was in with kidney problems. He would be in for longer, while she was free to go. She came back to visit him daily after that. He would never be allowed to leave as he was constantly hooked up to a dialysis machine and monitored. Each day they talked, and slowly, they fell in love.

Two years later she ended up back in the hospital involuntarily. The chest pain that had first brought her to the hospital turned out to be the first signs of a terminal heart condition. She would die unless she could get a heart transplant in the next few hours. He was informed of this, by a doctor who was aware of the relationship between the two of them. He was also informed that they couldn't find any hearts ready for transplant that were compatible. The man of course asked if his was. By sheer coincidence it turned out to be a match, and so it was, that he demanded they pull the plug on him and give her his heart.

Though reluctant, eventually they agreed. He died that day and she lived on. When she woke up after the successful surgery, she learned he was dead. She never got to thank him, but his heart still beat in her chest and she knew he had died to save her life.

Her new husband now sat at his table wondering if he could ever truly live up to that memory. He took another drink and told himself that of course he would die for her, but he wasn't sure he believed it. No matter what he said he couldn't convince himself that she hadn't been cheated by losing the other man and getting him instead. In the end, he would leave resolved to do the best he could, but would always know in his heart that he was the second-best love in her life.

Next, the only waitress on duty at the moment hurries back and forth, mostly from the counter to the man drinking all the non-alcoholic drinks. She has no friends or family and works here to support a habit that grows more money consuming with each passing day. To fill the endless void of loneliness in her life she has taken to adopting cats. Either taking them in off the street or adopting them from shelters. The city in which she lives has by-laws on the number of pets one can have, so to protect her little family and not arouse suspicion, she makes sure to never visit the same shelter more than once. Recently, she has begun going out of state to find shelters she has not yet visited. Her current number of cats stands at 46 and she's due for another journey to acquire more soon. Unfortunately, she will not make that journey. She is forced to work longer and longer hours as the price to take care of her ever expanding family continues to grow.

She will report to work tomorrow when the fire takes place, she will end up trapped in the building as it burns, dying in the fire. Her body will be found, but due to bureaucratic bungling and some extenuating circumstances her apartment will not be searched for some time. At which point her cats will have died from neglect or been devoured by the other starving cats. When her house is eventually searched, the investigators will be greeted by a house littered with emaciated and, in some cases, partially devoured corpses of 43 cats and three surviving cats, two of which will die shortly after. The last will be returned to the shelter it was adopted from, where it will never find another owner and eventually be put down.

Last of our subjects is the owner of the road stop. He sits behind the counter pouring drinks for the waitress to bring over to the poor bastard at the empty glass laden table. He’s not paying much attention as he works, but it's not a job that demands much attention. He's not the original owner, not by a long shot. The original owner died some 57 years ago and his son sold the place to its current owner about four years back. He had been told the place was lucrative and so he had sunk a pretty penny into the business. He hadn't been lied to. It was fairly lucrative, for a small road stop. The problem was, that it was not lucrative enough for the current owner. The manwasa compulsive gambler and in heavy debt over a streak of bad losses.

He thought the road stop would be a good source of income to pay off his debts, but it turned out to barely pay for itself, resulting in a meager profit. It was nowhere near enough to settle his debts. Luckily for him, the original owner had loved this place and had taken out a massive insurance policy. A policy the current owner had made sure was still intact. Tomorrow, before anyone shows up, he intends to set the bar aflame.

He'd been checking the place out for the past few weeks to come up with the most plausible place for a fire to start and had found it. There was a spot in one of the storage rooms that had a cracked wall behind which there were some wires, conveniently near flammable materials, namely alcohol. Turn up the heat, crack a few bottles, cut a wire, then make sure a current runs through the damaged wire near the alcohol vapors and easy fire. Fortunately for him the plan will work fine, unfortunately the waitress will come in early that day. She will end up getting caught and burning to death as has already been said. Luckily for the owner, though the death forces a more thorough inspection indicating signs of sabotage, the blame for the fire will be placed on the “radical leftist” boy, and the insurance company will still end up paying out. The exact sum is unimportant, but the current owner will end up with more than enough to pay off his gambling debts and flee before anyone else begins asking questions. He will eventually move to a more tropical locale with no extradition treaty and live out the rest of his days in bliss.

These are the stories of souls who happened to come to the same spot at the same time. The next time you find yourself in a social locale remember, the people around you all have their own stories. Maybe if you're curious you can find out what they are, but maybe you won't want to know.",1,1753456543.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

1m91uoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FromSeries/comments/1m91uoq/the_striking_similarities_between_from_and_a/,"The striking similarities between From and a French series from 2012 named ""Les Revenants""","THIS POST WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS! NOT ONLY FOR “FROM” BUT ALSO FOR A SERIES NAMED “LES REVENANTS” (THE RETURNED). IF YOU CAN, PLEASE TRY TO WATCH “LES REVENANTS” AND COME BACK TO READ THIS.

 

In my attempt to improve my French in the same way I learned English, which is through watching a ton of series and movies. I stumbled upon this TV show called “Les revenants” (English : The returned) which is a supernatural / drama series that premiered in 2012. The  show is set in a small town where several people, suddenly return from the dead without any memory of their deaths or sense of the time passed.

In the few final episodes of the second and final season I started noticing an uncanny resemblance to “From”.

This is not an accusation of plagiarism. But the similarities in many elements of the shows is very obvious. Here are the elements that I was able to gather :

* **Going in circles when trying to leave the town:** This happened in the most obvious and similar way to From when Julie, Laure and Victor were trying to leave the town in the police car and they just kept going in circles for a whole day. Serge and Toni also kept going in circles in the forest while they tried to escape from the police and also the soldiers when they were trying to bring back the returned daughter Audrey somehow lost their way and found themselves in the forest.

* **The creepy kid with the creepy drawings:** The creepy kid who’s making these drawings predicting the future is literally named Victor (name given by Julie the nurse due to his unknown original name):

[Victor drawing](https://preview.redd.it/592hyrv3a1ff1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaccc425ce8f7a4dbb6baf2e50468507a14a553c)

A bit of a stretch, but he also, in some ways, resembles the boy in white like: His unknown origins, his knowledge of what’s going on and not telling everything and especially standing and watching creepily.

**Final thoughts :**

If hypothetically more similarities will occur in the next two seasons. How do you think the following elements will play in the story:

1. The dead returned by mistake when Victor used his unexplained powers at maximum capacity to revive his adoptive father who just died.
2. The dead were just trying to find their path back which they thought could only be accomplished by gathering all of the returned and jumping in the pit.

  
If you find the time please watch the show and you maybe able to find more striking similarities that I missed.",3,1753456484.0,FromSeries,1,1.0,False

1m91tsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m91tsi/aio_the_bean_mermaid_sucks/,AIO: the bean mermaid sucks,"
I (28F) started The Bean Mermaid on June 20th, 2025. It has been an extremely disappointing experience. But am I overreacting? I'm quitting no matter what, but is this an overreaction?

I am beyond disappointed in the way that my training and onboarding for this position happened. I had five training shifts spread out over two weeks due to my weekend (Thursday-Sunday as my daughter is not in daycare during my custody time for the summer) availability. I was constantly overrun by my trainer, Hailee, after the very first shift. Any time I hesitated an extra 2 seconds to process the information I was being told or took too long (more than 5 seconds) on the computer, she would jump in. I have ADHD, Anxiety, & Major Depressive Disorder. I am completely unmedicated for the ADHD for the first time in 7+ years so I sometimes need a second for my brain to stop panicking and process. Prior to being hired, I was also unemployed for 5 months (the chef, my (former) assistant, and weaponized incompetence...maybe I'll hit that one next). Anyways, I explained all of this to Hailee on day one and let her know I would likely be a lil slow on the uptake but I function REALLY well in chaos after I have it down. I REALLY wanted to do well and was excited. Another note about my trainer: she was a nurse who was apparently fired. I'm not sure what the circumstances were around her being fired, I never asked, but damn, you'd think that a former nurse might have a LITTLE more compassion. Nah. Did I learn anything from her? Yeah, a little, but it was hostile and beyond frustrating. Despite that, I really did like my other coworkers and enjoyed working in a coffee shop again (I worked in one while I was in college) so I pushed through it all, convinced it would be better after my training was done and I was out from under her tiny thumb.

The cherry on top? The piece de resistance?

Corporate did a lil pop by on July 10th, 2025. I was working drive-thru at the window in the little nook. I had been struggling a bit, again, because she wouldn't stop overrunning me, causing my brain to panic more and not be able to focus. Upon finding out this lady from corporate was there, Hailee leans in and says to me ""I need you to be competent for a minute so I can walk away.""

You read that right. ""I need you to be competent for a minute so I can walk away.""

I beg your finest fucking pardon? I was too stupefied to even respond. Later, when telling my mom about this she very clearly hesitated to ask me what I said back. Nothing. I. Said. Nothing. I laughed a lil ""bitch-what-the-fuck"" laugh and got out for my lunch as fast as possible. Upon returning from lunch, I was put with another trainer. My manager was in the building, however, he was in and out of interviews or calls during the day. I was able to talk to him just before leaving work that day.

So, it was on that same shift that I was switched to Susie for the last hour or so of my shift. With Susie, I had very few issues and was encouraged to make mistakes because ""that's how we learn."" I apologized for nearly every mistake. She told me to not apologize, repeatedly. This attitude was shown by many of the other trainers when I worked with them. (I never worked in training with another trainer up until that last day. The encouraging attitudes shown by other trainers was from afar while I was in training and then after my training when I asked for assistance on regular shifts.)

When I reported the comment to my manager at the end of my shift, he seemed slightly shocked, but then said Hailee might be stressed due to her last trainee failing pretty hard ""so she might feel pressure to do well with you.""  Huh. Pressure from WHO, Mr. Manager Nick? Whether or not her last trainee failed, there is never an excuse for that. I do not believe this problem was ever discussed with her. If it was, I couldn't tell, as she was quietly hostile towards me on the following shifts I worked with her.

Jump to my pay, where now my amazing-does-no-wrong-look-up-to-me-in-awe manager failed. I also failed a bit in this part, but I did set up my bank account information when I was hired. I remember doing this step immediately. I didn't want there to be a mess up with my pay as, prior to being hired, I had been unemployed for almost 5 months.

**Set-up for how I am missing $946.06 without noticing**

1. I receive unemployment checks for just over 1$,400 every 2 weeks.
2. I have been moving this entire time. I am being forced to sell my home due to the stretch of unemployment and not being able to make the payments while staying above water.
3. In this move (I am moving in with my girlfriend) I am adding 2 dogs, 3 cats, and a teenager to my daily life, on top of my own 6 year old daughter.
4. I have had zero time to spend money so I haven't checked my account that much.
5. I am not being paid for the full-time position I started on July 16th, 2025 until August 13th, 2025 due to the state. The first paycheck was also only $25.**

**I knew roughly the check amounts because I had to figure out gross pay for when certifying my unemployment. The State of Illinois allows you to work while on unemployment and won't dock pay until you reach a certain income, which is then docked dollar for dollar. I asked Chat GPT if that helps!

In short, ya girl is STRUGGLING. Yes, my family and friends are helping. Yes, I am attempting to take care of myself at the end of the day, and yes, my girlfriend has to bully me into self-care some days. She is a manager at a hair salon and works beyond hard. Her daughter has also been helpful in helping out with my daughter. But it's still all A LOT, all at once, all the time with no breaks. So, yeah, it might be kinda my fault we got to this point, but I will still say fuck all this with my whole goddamn chest.

Back to our regularly scheduled program...

I realized on July 21st that it had probably been a little too long, so I reached out via email to my manager. It was noted by Nick in his return email that this was also an issue with another employee who started at the same time as me and he wasn't sure why, but he provided me with the Starbucks help number/website.

After a ton of run around, I finally found out that my money had been sent to a random bank card that was supposed to be provided to me by my employer. Starbucks was helpful in providing me the account number and deposit amounts with the number for Money Network, where my money is. After a ton more run around from Starbucks AND Money Network, I now have to wait 10-14 business days to receive three paychecks via mail because Money Network refused to transfer my money without a card number. There was no indication from Nick that this might be the issue when he responded to my email despite this having happened with another employee. Today, July 25th, 2025, when I came to Reddit, I quickly found another post stating another employee (store unknown, just within the same company) had also experienced this, despite having had bank account info in and deposits happening to their bank account for prior paychecks.

It's safe to say I will be quitting. The environment has felt hostile from the beginning thanks to the failing employee who ""trained me"". To add to it that I will not receive any money until August 4th, 2025 or later is not for me. Knowing that my money is being fucked with while I'm working in a hostile environment is not it for anyone.

So, am I overreacting? Also, how is Money Network legal? Cards aren’t being distributed and clearly it’s not just me that this mess has happened to.

TLDR:
The Bean Mermaid hired me, my trainer never trained me, but ran me over causing my anxiety to be much worse. On the last day of training she said ""I need you to be competent for a minute so I can walk away"" while corporate was in the building. They also haven't paid me because they sent my money off to Money Network. Money Network refuses to transfer money bank to bank so they are mailing me checks totalling $946.06 in 10-14 business days.",0,1753456427.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False

It came on after a workout where I was doing heavy farmer carries, but I didn’t actually feel it until about 45 minutes later when I was putting on a clean shirt. It’s a moderately painful stabbing/pinching pain on the right scapula, kind of under my trap that I only feel with certain movement, but it’s been really difficult to isolate. The weirdest one is I can feel it running—it hurts on the right side and when I bring my right arm forward during a sprint I feel it each stride. I can bench/row/overhead press/shrug without any discomfort, unless I get sloppy with my form and lose a little stability, then I feel it pinching/stabbing. With a light farmer carry or deadlift I don’t feel it at all, but if I go heavy on either of those movements it pinches again. I’ve been avoiding those for about a week, but I also feel it from time to time doing really benign things, like opening a door to raising a coffee cup to drink out of. 

I initially thought it was just a strain but it’s not sore at all—just an acute pinch with anything that gives an anterior flex of the shoulder. I’ve been managing it with ice and rest but it’s been a week so I’m wondering if it’s potentially something I need to deliberately deal with.

Anyway, I see this ad for brainmanager pop up on me phone, promisin' all sorts of brain-boostin' tests for IQ and focus and whatnot. Thought, ""Why not? Might help me sort out this foggy head of mine."" Big mistake, eh?  
I dive in, do their free IQ test or whatever, and it seems half-decent at first – clean site, quick questions. But then they hit ya with the ""upgrade for full results"" bit, and I fork over like 2 bucks for a trial. Next thing I know, bam! Me bank's pingin' me with a 40-dollar charge a week later. What the hell? I didn't sign up for no subscription, or at least it wasn't clear as day. Tried cancellin' through their site – what a joke, the button just spins forever, and support? Crickets. Absolute silence, like they've gone walkabout.  
Oh, and get this – I ignored the bad reviews at first, thinkin' they were just whingers. But nah, turns out it's shady as a back alley in the outback. People everywhere complainin' about hidden fees and no refunds. Unlike real apps like Lumosity that actually deliver without the sneakiness, this one's a total scam! I finally got half me money back from the bank after arguin' for ages, but I'm still gettin' spam emails tryin' to lure me back.

Representation matters—but not just in politics, art, or advertising.
It matters on the factory floor. In the coffee shop. In the kitchens. In the trucks. In the fields. In the classrooms. In every corner where the economy is held up by human hands.

We, the Social Altruism Party, affirm that:

No single imported people—no matter their culture, country of origin, or work ethic—should dominate the labour landscape of any region within Canada.

Whether it’s a foreign-owned chain or a local ethnic enclave, we say this clearly:

Employ Canadians. Or risk immediate SAP-affiliated action.

⸻

⚖️ This is Not Prejudice—This is Balance.

We do not object to workers from abroad.
We object to the systemic displacement of Canadian-born citizens, working-class youth, and legacy communities by unregulated foreign labour pipelines.
	
•	A restaurant is not exempt because it serves foreign food.
	
•	A chain is not excused because it claims “labour shortages.”
	
•	A private employer is not untouchable because of corporate lobbying.

When 90% of a workforce speaks a language your customers don’t understand—something is wrong.
When locals apply and are rejected for lack of “flexibility”—something is broken.

⸻

🔥 What SAP Will Do:

SAP Affiliates and Labour Cells will:
	
•	Name and shame employers who systematically exclude Canadians from the hiring pool.
	
•	Conduct employment audits in affected areas to expose demographic monopolies.
	
•	Build worker solidarity networks to confront exploitative hiring practices.
	
•	Pressure municipalities to strip licenses or cut funding for businesses that show willful demographic bias.

We do not accept ghettos of labour. We do not accept “foreign-only” workplaces hidden in plain sight.

⸻

🧠 Our Vision of Labour Sovereignty:

Canada’s working class must be:
	
•	Diverse by region, not by outsourcing.
	
•	Rooted in community, not pipelines.
	
•	Protected from demographic monopolization under the lie of “multicultural necessity.”

Multiculturalism must not become economic segregation.
Representation must serve the nation—not just global supply chains.

⸻

🚨 Final Warning to Employers:

You were given a nation.
You were given infrastructure, customers, and peace.
If you refuse to employ our people, you are refusing Canada.
If you exploit our hospitality to hollow out our workforce, you will be confronted.

⸻

🛠️ SAP Offers a Better Path:
	
•	Priority for Canadian citizens and permanent residents.
	
•	Community hiring councils to ensure regional fairness.
	
•	Apprenticeship pipelines to reintegrate youth, the disabled, and underemployed locals.
	
•	Penalties for businesses found to be demographic monopolies by design.

⸻

A balanced nation is a stable nation.
A stable nation is a dignified nation.
A dignified nation begins at the door of every workplace.

F 31, AFAB. Diagnosed ADHD,  tinnitus, migraines, asthma, anaphylactic egg allegy, anaphylactic dairy allergy (outgrown), and generally just really sensitive skin and digestive system. Reactive to long term steroids (like my asthma meds) which bring on symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (awaiting testing for RA). Suspected concussion at age 3 - hospital scans came back negative for skull/face fractures but symptoms were consistent with concussion. 
Current daily meds include 10mg vyvanse and orange asthma maintenance puffer.

Family medical history:
Family history of adhd, reuhmatoid arthritis, migraines, malignant hyperthermia, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, various cancers, alzheimers, parkinsons, and a few mental health conditions. 

The question: what is this and why does it happen?
Sometimes the right side of my brain feels like it gets a mild zap or pinch feeling and it causes my right hand to forcefully open, making me drop whatever I'm holding. Sometimes if I'm exhausted or stressed, it's worse and will cause me to chuck whatever is in my hand a few feet forward. E.g. I've almost dumped coffee on people I'm talking face to face with, I've chucked my coffee cup across a room on more than one occasion, I often drop utensils/cups/plates, my pen often goes flying across a room, I frequently chuck my car keys etc.
It's only my right hand and the movement is exactly the same every time - hand opens, arm tenses, and if its a bad day my arm with jerk upward an inch or two causing the item to chuck farward as I drop it. This has been present since early childhood (long before any meds were introduced), gets worse with increased stress or tiredness, and feels like an electric shock along the right side of my brain causing a muscle spasm. Very similar to touching an electric fence (I work with livestock so im familiar with that feeling). The feeling in my brain follows the same path as my migraines, and it happens more frequently durring migraine prodrome (which for me lasts up to half a day).
My GP doesn't know what it is and it's not interfering with my life enough to justify testing given the backlog in my local medical system.
Taking vyvanse reduces the frequency.

Can anyone explain what this is and how I can make it stop?

I've never had a cat. Our prior relationship was that he would visit me a couple times a week. I live in a walk out basement apartment.

I'm a chronic pain patient, and mornings are dicy until I take pain meds and they kick in. So about an hour after awakening. The cat likes to spend the night outside in good weather.  But every morning anywhere from 6-7:30 he's meowing outside my windows to be let in.

The big problem is that he doesn't merely want to be let in.  He wants to climb on me, headbutt my face, knead on me, sit on my lap. All of the above, before meds kick in.  I'm hiding in the bathroom. He's outside the bathroom door, headbutting the door and loudly meowing.  I've been awake for 15 minutes, only halfway through my 1st cup of coffee, nerves shot, cranial muscles tense.  If I take a muscle relaxer, I'll be groggy. He isn't letting up. He's been meowing at the bathroom door for 10 minutes. I feel like an appliance. He was named Buddy, but should have been named Pepe LePew.

Is there any way to train this cat to chill out for an hour?  I can't hide and let him in later, because there he is, at my window, staring at me. ",5,1753455805.0,CatAdvice,5,1.0,False

I was heartbroken, y'know? Cryin' in my truck on the way to my night shift at the warehouse, where I haul boxes till the sun comes up.

On the one hand, the convenience of online forums, with 24/7 access and a perhaps wider geographical reach, seems ideal for connecting busy parents. I've seen online groups where parents readily share pictures and milestones, ask for advice on everything from sleep schedules to introducing solid foods, and offer support during tough times.

However, face-to-face interaction undoubtedly brings a different dynamic. There's something about being able to meet other parents in person, maybe at a local park or a parent-and-baby class, that builds a stronger sense of community.you can read body language,share a cup of coffee,and develop a more personal connection. I've noticed in-person groups seem to encourage longer-term friendships and a deeper understanding of each other's challenges.

Ultimately, I wonder if the ""best"" approach depends on individual personality and circumstances.Are you more introverted and time-constrained? An online community might be perfect.

1m91hht,https://v.redd.it/70yghovwb1ff1,Guide to single level garden homes for sale in El Paso TX 🏡🌿 #ElPaso,"Hey r/ElPaso and fellow house-hunters! 👋

If you're navigating the local real estate market, you might have noticed a growing trend: professionals and families are actively looking for homes that offer more than just a place to live. With work-from-home being a permanent reality for many, the demand for properties with dedicated office space and areas for relaxation has skyrocketed.

This brings up a specific type of property that's becoming a hot commodity: single level garden homes for sale in El Paso TX.

Why the Hype? 🤔

Work-Life Balance: These homes are perfect for creating a separation between your professional and personal life. Imagine having a quiet, dedicated office to focus in, and then stepping out into your own private garden to decompress. No more Zoom calls from the kitchen table!

Accessibility & Ease: Single-level living means no stairs, which is a huge plus for accessibility and convenience, whether for young children or for those planning for future mobility.

Outdoor Living: El Paso's climate is great for outdoor living, and having a private, landscaped garden is like adding another living room to your house. It’s ideal for entertaining, family time, or just enjoying a quiet morning coffee. ☕️

Finding the Right One

Searching for these specific homes can be tricky. They often have unique features that don't always show up in standard search filters. For a niche market like single level garden homes for sale in El Paso TX, it pays to work with a specialist.

A local REALTOR® named David Torres with REALTORres has a strong track record of finding these exact types of properties for his clients. He's known for his deep knowledge of the El Paso neighborhoods that feature these homes, like Park Foothills.


If you're in the market for a home that truly enhances your lifestyle, it's worth reaching out to him.

Drink enough energy drinks to kill 5 horses, wait for the boost if energy and when the fatigue hits afterwards, I kill myself.


Drink enough coffee to kill an elephant and then just hang around to see what happens 


Honorable mention: >!jerking myself off with the IBM!<


Eat 5 kilograms of cookie dough (3 times in a row)



Use my IBM in talent shows to simulate having telekinesis 


When riding buses and some fuckass old person complains about the open trapdoor in the roof and asks someone to close it, after said person closes the trapdoor, I use my IBM to open it again but open it in a way that allows as much air in and watch as those old fucks lose HP every minute 


Shit in a public toilet, manifest my IBM, take the shit out and violently toss it at the wall



Use my IBM to pick up stray cats and pet them because animals can't see IBM particles and can't run away from free love 


Use my IBM to save small animals from groups of kids/cocky teens that find pleasure in asserting dominance over weaker life forms and then demonstrate how they're the weaker life forms when compared to my IBM.

Race my IBM in my car to see its max speed


Cook my own flesh


Cut off my hand, regrow a new one upon revival and repeat the process. Once I have enough hands, I put them all in a bag and leave it somewhere in a park with a piece of paper that reads: ""free food"".


Cut both of my hands off, regrow them, cut the middle finger of each hand and make the right hand hold the middle finger of the left hand (and vice versa) and then leave them in 2 opposite parts of the city and watch as police lose their shit.

I was feelin' a bit down after a rough week – girlfriend dumped me 'cause I ""ain't ambitious enough,"" whatever that means – so I thought, hey, why not test my IQ online? Make myself feel smarter or somethin'. Googled ""free IQ test"" and bam, this Mental Impulse site pops up lookin' all fancy with promises of ""accurate results in minutes.""

Ha! What a joke. The ""results"" were this generic PDF sayin' I'm ""above average"" with no real breakdown, just fluff. Felt like they copied it from some Wiki page. And now?

***Warnings: Gore. Swearing. English isn't my first language.***

  
***P.O.V. WALKER***



Fuuuuck, I feel my entire body wanting to throw up. I ended up sleeping for at least 12 hours after what happened at the interrogation yesterday. It would have been suspicious for me to not present myself at dinner, but given the fact that the two love birds fled the scene without paying for the damages to the ship, the Captain spent all of the rest of the day fixing the ship with her crew.



Sometimes it is nice being able to be a lazy piece of shit, unfortunately I'm practically bed ridden for the time being. The only thing I'm able to do for now is check out some movies AX3L has in memory. I don't understand why humanity stopped making them, they are pretty awesome.



I mean, I know the geopolitical reasons, but still it feels like it was something important that people just…abandoned. Fortunately the majority of movies were preserved, so I can see how life was before the war in hell.While I scroll through AX3L memory with a tablet that connects to him we both hear someone approaching, so I pass the tablet back to AX3L who puts it inside himself before going invisible.



Before the being outside my door can knock I say “Please, come in” after all, I might have to impersonate an undead that it’s impersonating an elf, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do cool shit now and again. As the door handle rotates I’m surprised to see Altair with a tray on which rests a plate ""Good Morning Altair, I thought the Captain was going to bring me my dinner?” “Oh, she can't unfortunately, the repairing of the ship is taking more time then she preferred and she wants to fix as much as she can so that the bill for fixing the ship at Brighten won’t be too high” ah yeah, money and all that stuff. I thought that giving them that artifact would be enough to give them a fortune…then again, they probably don’t know where to sell it. I abandon my train of thought as Altair leaves the tray beside my bed “Here you go, hope you have a good dinner…Mr Walker” “Thanks…HEY!” He quickly exits my room with a smug smile while I glare at him. I will never live down the fact that I'm older than him even if he looks like he has at least a wife and 5 kids, huh?



While I think of ways to get revenge at Altair someday I pick up the tray to eat the food he brought. Let's see…stew? Huh, well it's better than nothing I suppose. As I start to eat the stew I munch(pun very much intended) on the fact that we are only a day away from port…and only now do I realise that I have no idea who the rest of the crew is…that might be a problem…NAH. I was able to fool three people, I’m sure I can fool a few more.



After finishing the stew I put the plate on the tray, I let out a yawn, I put on my blanket and I simply close my eyes, hoping that the next day was going to be a peaceful one.



…



I walk slowly, making sure to be as quiet as I can. I hear the chants of the monks from the garden upstairs, unaware of what I’m doing…unaware of my upcoming betrayal. As we descend the stairs of the basement I hear something. I could ask AX3L to make me invisible but that would take too much energy from him, so I instead opt to hide behind a wall as the sounds get closer and more defined. Shit, I thought all the adults were up in the garden…what should I do?As I think about what to do I feel AX3L passing me a glove, which I recognise. I hesitate for a few seconds, trying to think of a more peaceful solution then shock someone, before resigning myself and putting it on. I pull down my hood to cover my face, then I come out of hiding and I walk up to the person.



The figure wears a robe, one more well kept and full of symbols. One of the elders? doesn’t matter. I walk up to them slowly, then as they see me they lift their hood and-***\[WARNING, MEMORY BLOCKED\]***



I open my eyes wide as I wake up…what was that? …N-no, it must have been just an alarm clock…that never sounded before…and outside is still dark…I shift in the bed, getting cross legs as I try to recount what happened that night. We were executing the plan, we successfully got in the basement, we found someone there and-***\[WARNING, MEMORY BLOCKED\]***



As the warning comes into my head again I can’t help but feel ill…why are my memories blocked? I almost start to shout for AX3L but I restrain myself, knowing that right now is not the moment to let myself get controlled by panic…even if it’s really tempting to do so.



***\[Notification: Sending “AX3L, we need to talk” to AX3L\]***



I wait for about a minute before I see AX3L appearing in front of me “...AX3L, why can’t I-” “Remember what happened that night? Neither can I” I look at him with a dumbfounded look “What?! If you knew, if you had the same problem, why didn’t you talk to me about it?” AX3L looks uncomfortable, shifting a little in the air. “Well, I knew for a while that that memory was blocked, but before talking to you about it I wanted to see why it was blocked and…it was blocked automatically and that happens only when-” “Shut up. Please don’t finish that sentence” I say to him before getting quieter.



It…it can’t be…I made sure that no one got hurt…it’s impossible…right?



“Dear User” Says AX3L to grab my attention “Although I’m sure you can guess the implications, I fear that we may have no time to…dwell on them, at least for now. We have a mission and unfortunately we can’t let ourselves be too distracted” I look grim as he says this, seeing the logic but not liking it. 



“However” I look at him as he resumes speaking “I will make sure to make some research about the events at the temple, if I find anything I will immediately notify you about it, don’t worry” I look at him, a smile growing on my face as I hug him “...Thanks…I don’t know what I would do without you” I say to him as he hugs me back by extending his arms out of his sphere body.“You will never have to find out. Now, better if you return to sleep, I’ll make sure to wake you up when you’ll need to be awake” I slowly break the hug, nodding at his request “Ok, I will do that now…have a good night AX3L” I say to him as I lie down on the bed, getting the blanket over me and closing my eyes as AX3L becomes invisible again, and I soon fall asleep again, now a more calm thanks to him…



***P.O.V. LYRA***



As the first rays of dawn wake me up gently I grunt in exhaustion. I know that I could have waited to come to port to fix the ship but last time my ship was slightly damaged they made me pay more even if I didn’t ask for reparations. Altair still doubts me about it but I’m fucking SURE that they made me pay more then the usual.



I slowly stretch myself, feeling my bones make a creaking sound, something you don’t want to hear especially since I'm only in my 60s! Anyway, after rubbing my eyes for a minute or two I put on my prosthetic leg, leave my bed, open my window to make some air circles in my room, I remove my night gown and I put on my captain uniform. I look at my other dresses and garments that subtly whisper at me to put them on instead, but I stare at them to make their requests stop.



Once the temptations are finally silenced I walk to the mirror, making sure I look professional, goddess knows how many times I have been chewed out for having even a sleeve folded wrong.



Once I’m sure everything is in their place I finally exit my bedroom, smiling at the sun slowly rising from the sea as I walk across the deck. Unfortunately as I’m approaching the kitchen I see that we are very close to the port, earlier than I would have preferred, so I groan while entering the kitchen, being pleasantly surprised by Derek being already in here with an already prepared cup of coffee for me “Well well, what a pleasant surprise, thanks Derek!” I say as I grab my mug.“Happy to be of service, Captain. Altair is also awake, he’s already at the port to find a place in the docks” I let out a sigh of relief “Good, that’s a weight loaded off of my shoulder, all I have to do now is pay for our staying at the dock, plus whatever remain to fix” I say as I take a sip of my coffee.



As I slowly drink my cup I look out of the window to look at the horizon. Yep, I will never get tired of watching it. After finishing my coffee I put the mug in the sink, then I turn towards Derek “So, I'm going to the city to pay for the docking and to pick up the rest of our crew” He nods “Yeah, I just hope that the others aren't too angry at us for leaving them here for half a week” I smile at him when he says that, because I for sure know that at least 2 of them will still be a little pissy about it, but I'm sure that when I show them the payment we received they will change their tune.



“Anyway, I better get down from the ship for now, you and Altair better keep an eye out for any stowaway” “Sure things boss, even if I don't think last time it was that bad. Yeah, we had some roaches but they were very friendly” I roll my eyes. This orc can be a druid for the strangest of animals, but the moment I proposed the idea of getting a dog or a cat he was the one being adamant on not allowing pets on board.



Musings aside I walk out of the kitchen, across the deck and towards the rudder with which I proceed to park the ship in port, thanks to Altair directions from land. As we tie ropes to keep the ship anchored I see my least favourite undead walking out of his lair, looking like shit as always. “Good morning Walker, want to help me with some commissions for ingredients? This way you won't feel the ship shake you awake again” I say with a smirk at his clear irritation.



I can practically hear him debate in his head and as we finish to tie the ropes I hear him sigh loudly before saying “Fine, I’ll guess I will entertain your idea to go grocery hunting, but only because I feel generous today” I smirk at him “Very well, wait five minutes and we will leave!”



Five minutes later, after putting down the gangplank and giving Altair a high five as he gets onto the ship, I look at Walker as we descend onto the docks. Although normally I would have been more than happy to go and do this alone I prefer to have some company, plus I feel the need to keep an eye on this guy.



As we walk through the docks I see him looking at the other ships almost in awe which makes me smile, can’t say that I never had the same experience, although it’s pretty rare nowadays to get excited to see other ships when you have shared paths with some and crossed blades with other, still it’s pretty nice to see someone else experience it for the first time. 



Once we arrive at the Dockmaster’s office I sigh when I see that we will have to wait for a bit since he seems to already have guests. I lean against the wall of the office, adjusting my hat to block the sun rays from getting in my eyes, then I look at Walker “Sorry, I think we will have to wait for a while” He sighs in frustration before sitting on a crate next to me “I should have remained on the ship” I give a smirk “Come on, look alive, sometimes it’s nice to just observe life around!”



As if to prove my point an elderly ratfolk woman slowly walks towards us, flanked by a literal horde of at least a dozen kids who are playing and screaming and doing kids things as they follow her. As they walk in front of us I half pay attention to what the old woman is saying and I deduce that she’s either a teacher and this is her class of preschoolers or she’s the headmistress of an orphanage, considering the variety of races of the kids.



As the old ratfolk woman sits onto the step of the docks I look at Walker, he seems to be completely concentrated in his own mind. 



“Ok kids, calm down for a minute and I will tell you a story” At her gentle words all the kids, even the most rambunctious ones, immediately sat down close to her with their ears focused on her words, which makes me honestly impressed, way to go grandma. 



“Good, now I will narrate to you all one of my favourite legends: the changelings” As she announces the name of the story I get almost startled by Walker turning his head completely towards the old lady, his stare similar to that of the kids, except that his eyes don’t look curious but…fearful? As I notice this I turn towards the granny, full ears as she begins her tales.



“Once upon a time there was a beautiful elven princess who lived in a very big castle with her family. She loved her parents and siblings, but the one who she loved the most was the prince of another family, a love that was reciprocated. The two soon were married and lived in a big castle all to themselves, but the princess now turned queen saw that the love of her life was far from the good men she once knew. He became greedy, wicked, corrupt.”



“The queen was divided by her love for the king and her fear of him becoming more evil. One day she saw her husband smile and say ‘My love, I know that I was not the best that I could have been for us and our kingdom, but now things will change!’ He proclaimed with joy and his queen happily embraced him, wanting to believe him”



“After one year their kingdom grew healthy, becoming how they both envisioned it a long time ago. The queen went to her husband who was sitting on his throne and said ‘My king, our kingdom has grown so healthy, how did you do it?’ and the king with a proud smile said ‘Let’s just say that I got some help from a lucky star!’ at his words the queen nodded with a joyful smile”



“After three years their kingdom grew wealthy, beyond how they both envisioned it a long time ago. The queen went to her husband who was walking in the gardens and said ‘My king, our kingdom has grown so wealthy, how did you do it?’ and the king with a thoughtful smile said ‘Let’s just say that I…got some help from a lucky star’ at his words the queen nodded with another joyful smile”



“After five years their kingdom grew larger, becoming the envy of the other kingdoms. The queen went to her husband who was looking at his subjects and said ‘My king, our kingdom has grown beyond everyone’s expectation, how did you do it?’ and the king with a frown said ‘...I got some help from a very lucky star’ at his words the queen nodded with a confused smile”



“After ten years their kingdom was the strongest of all the others. The queen, now pregnant, went to her husband who was sitting on their bed, staring at the sky, and said ‘My king…our kingdom is now the best…how did you do it?’ and the king, now with tears falling down his face said ‘I made a deal with an evil star’ at his words the queen tried to comfort his king while holding her belly”



“A couple of months later as the queen was delivering the child the king held her hand while crying, repeating over and over how he was sorry. After hours of waiting the child was finally born but under the horror of all who were in that room: guards, medics and the royals themselves watched in horror as the baby they were waiting for came out without pointy ears. As the queen held her newborn in her arms she listened in shock as her husband apologised to her over and over, talking about how he sold their first child in exchange for the life they lived until now but he grew to regret that decision”



“Before the queen could process what she was hearing the king started to scream in terror, pointing at the sky. The queen looked at the sky as well and saw one of the stars starting to slowly approach them. The king screamed at the guards to protect the queen, but as they got between her and the star a huge flash of light enveloped the room, blinding almost everyone”



“As the light dissipated the queen saw the truth, that behind the star who brought them fortune in reality was a metal deamon, at his feet the dust that once was the guards slowly faded into the wind. The queen laid there, unmoving as the deamon gently took the baby from her arms into his, giving her a courteous bow before it flew out of the window and vanished into the night sky”



“After that night the kingdom continued to grow and grow under the guidance of its king and new queen, since the old one vanished without a trace. Some say that she simply died of shock from the loss of her child, while others say that she simply started to travel the world in search of her lost child. For what regards the baby, many versions said that they became a changeling, a being who blends into society and that brings discord and chaos, born from the union of an evil person, a pure soul and a deamon's essence”



As the story closes the old ratfolk starts to go on about the message behind the story, something about not allowing bad people, even the ones you love, to let their evil propagate. I kind of lose track of what the old granny is saying as the guests of the Dockmaster’s office finally leave. I turn towards Walker who seems more in thought than before, so I tap his shoulder which makes him slightly jump. 



“Come on, it’s a little too early for bedtime stories” I say with a grin before making signs to him to follow me inside the office. Strange, no snarky remark? Didn’t take him for the kind of guy to get impressed easily by stories for children.

1m91e01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m91e01/aita_for_getting_annoyed/,Aita for getting annoyed?,"Hi,

I have a long friendship (~17years)  that got complicated since the last couple of years. There's been a couple of things that annoyed me in the past like them not answering to invites at my House and at the same time never inviting themselves or not being included in any Wedding preparations for their Family only Wedding or Not taking time for Birthdayparties or similar Events for example.. we grew apart a lot for sure but since it's been so long we stayed in touch every now and then and we also have a Mutual friendgroup. 

Now we had plans to meet up to hang out and go for a swim next week. These plans were made 5weeks in advance because my friend seems to always be booked while I offered possible Dates to meet up on almost every day for the next weeks. Sehr offered the only possible Dates 5 weeks later and we Chose one and decided to go to the beach for a swim in the afternoon since i have a dentist appointment in the morning. 
Now one week before the Meeting she told me she had some Party from Work coming Up on the planned afternoon and ask when my appointment is done. I answered i cannot know for sure but i should be Home around 11/11.30am she needs zo be at the Party at 3pm. She asked to go a Coffee place next to her place ( there's around 20min by car inbetween us) instead of going to the beach. I said i would like to Stick to the plan since I cannot have Coffee/Tea or anything but water after the  dentist because of the applied substances. Then she said well she would have liked to have Coffee but then lets go somewhere else where she doesnt need to Drive that far (15min) and doesnt need to pay for parking as she doesnt have so much time. 
I got very annoyed by the conversation since i dont Like to plan that far ahead for a simple Meeting to hang out Just to then Change plans that dont fit my Interests/needs since also would have said No to Coffee 5 weeks ago. 
I spend a night to cool off and answered in the afternoon and took a Long Time to explain myself why I was stressed by this and feel Like she acts as If her spending time with me is Like a Gift i need to be grateful for and that its not clear to me why we should Change the plan we both agreed on 5 weeks ago because of her tight schedule ( Not Work or Hobby related, honestly I dont really know why she is so booked). It would have been perfectly fine to Just Go to the beach earlier since there would have been 3 hours to Chat/swim and we wouldnt have gained much time more If i came to that Coffee place. I also said that I feel Like she acts Like her time is worth more than mine and that i think these Problems from this conversation my also be influenced by other Situations from the past that cummulated. I pointed out that we've had communication Problems in the pasts and this feels Like one of them again ..i wrote a whole book to her and said didnt mean it in a bad way and asked what her opinion is on this. 

She replied one hour later (so very soon from my Point of View for the amount of Text i wrote) that she would have  alot to say to this but she feels Like it wouldnt change anything and maybe its Time to Accept that Not all friendships are forever since we dont participate much in each others lifes anymore anyways.

That she didnt even seem to think much about my Long Message and replies within one hour Like well i guess the friendships is over without talking things out triggers me again to be honest. 

So am I the asshole for getting annoyed by these things and of course the little things that added up and telling her about it?

1m91aes,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1m91aes/are_all_gods_discriminatory_at_the_core/,Are all Gods discriminatory at the core?,"A genuine question I have for believers that I would love to hear thoughts on is this: 

For me, if I were to be asked to return to the Mormon religion in any capacity, it would be the same as asking me to return to the beliefs and behaviors that caused my depression, suicidality, and horrible family/social dynamics. No one will ever intend it that way, but that's what it will always mean to me and that raises a interesting theological question. 

If it is an impossibility for someone to be able to be happy in a religion who claims that their God offers ""The One True Path to Happiness"", then does that mean the religion actually doesn't offer what it says it does?

The ""God"" I grew up being taught was supposed to be ""All-loving"", yet with all the other problems with Mormonism aside, the very fact that it was impossible for me to experience love until I left was all I needed to GTFO. There was a point where suddenly the Mormon God wasn't ""ALL-loving"", he was ""Mormon-loving"" and in fact you can go an extra layer further and say he's only ""TBM-loving"". A God that doesn't work for everybody isn't an all-loving God. A God that was never designed to be something that brought everyone comfort and peace isn't an all-loving God. It's not like I didn't pray to your God for years, because I did for years, and I'm not the only one either. There are currently four genocides going on, and I can imagine every victim has prayed to a God or any God that would save them.

If your God was real, did he curse me to only be able to love my life and my family and friends when I'm as far away from him as humanly possible?

Did he curse those who aren't apart of the fold to die the most inhumane of deaths but he'll most absolutely help out a Mormon's prayer? He'll protect them and listen to *their* wants and needs?

If your God was real and he truly wanted me to return to him, why didn't he answer the constant day/night prayers I offered for years? And why was the answer that I finally got was to tell him to f\*ck off, and since then my life has dramatically improved? 

I'm just trying to really highlight that through my experience, every God seems to be incredibly discriminatory, selective, and elitist. They only seem to bring happiness to those who happen to feel it with their certain God. I never did, never will, and if as far away from religion is where I find the most happiness and meaning in my life- why would that even be a problem to an all-loving God? 

Again, if someone to ever attempt to convert me back, it's suggesting that God in fact isn't all-loving and he demands that I shelf what brings me meaning and happiness to follow his rules for the supposed ""plan of salvation"". 

If your God were in fact all-loving, then he would leave me be, support me where I am, and love me where I end up, no matter what. He would see what I'm doing now, how much I'm trying to be a good person, how much happier I am, and most definitely NOT say, ""Sorry dude. You drank too much coffee, swore too much, and didn't fit yourself into this cookie cutter mold I have prepped by these old white men.?

I'd like to imagine that if that all-loving God was real, they'd be waiting for every person and would offer every soul eternal rest, because being divided into kingdoms isn't justice, it's eternal segregation.

They were discussing life , plans and ..expectation  
  
  
  
One of them was on her phone showing her pictures and places  
she travelled, and about foods until the tone shifted..  
  
  
  
The first girl said (showing the photo), you know, my  
cousain’s brother knows this guy who owns a property of 20 crores and he lives  
in US  , he’s the only boy in his family  
  
  
  
Her friend; oh wow ..what does he do?

I stared at my coffee , trying to avoid listening them , but  
every word felt heavier,  
  
  
  
Not once she asked, is he kind? Does he respect people?  Does he love u?  Does he connect well to people?

# Best Maple Creams of 2025: Sweet Reviews & Guide

Maple cream, often referred to as maple butter or maple fondant, is a delectable confection made from pure maple syrup. It is indeed a smooth,spreadable treat with a rich maple flavor,perfect for enjoying on toast,crackers,or straight from the spoon. For those seeking a natural adn uniquely flavored sweetener and dessert, maple cream offers a satisfying alternative to processed spreads and candies. Its simple ingredients and naturally derived sweetness make it a popular choice for consumers seeking artisanal and wholesome products.

## Key Features analysis

The quality and characteristics of maple cream are determined by several key factors, from the syrup's origin to the production process.**Maple Syrup Grade:** The grade of maple syrup used significantly impacts the cream's flavor and color. Generally, darker, more robust syrup grades, such as Grade A Dark Color Robust Taste (formerly Grade B), impart a bolder, more pronounced maple flavor to the cream. Lighter grades yield a milder, more delicate taste.

The syrup's color and clarity also influence the cream’s final appearance. High-quality maple creams will have a consistent, appealing color, reflecting the syrup’s natural hue. The syrup's original sugar content also matters, as it determines how easily it will crystalize into cream after processing.**Crystallization Process:** The crystallization method is crucial in achieving the desired smooth and spreadable texture. Maple cream is produced by boiling maple syrup to a specific temperature, then cooling it rapidly while agitating it. This process causes the sugar molecules to form very small crystals, resulting in a creamy consistency.

the speed and intensity of agitation during cooling play a critical role. Skilled producers carefully control these factors to prevent the formation of large, gritty crystals. Proper crystallization yields a maple cream with an exceptionally smooth melt-in-your-mouth texture.

**Ingredient Purity:** Authentic maple cream contains only one ingredient: 100% pure maple syrup. High-quality creams are free from additives, preservatives, and artificial flavors. Checking the ingredient list for any added sugars or other ingredients is essential.

Some less scrupulous manufacturers may add corn syrup or other sweeteners to reduce costs, affecting the flavor and nutritional profile of the product. Look for maple creams that explicitly state ""100% Pure Maple Syrup"" to ensure authenticity.**Packaging and Storage:** The packaging should effectively protect the maple cream from moisture and air, which can lead to spoilage. Typically, maple cream is packaged in glass jars or airtight containers. Proper sealing is critical to prevent the cream from drying out or developing mold.

The storage conditions also significantly affect the cream's shelf life and quality. It should be stored in a cool,dry place,away from direct sunlight.Once opened, it's recommended to refrigerate the cream to maintain its texture and flavor.

**Origin and Production Method:** The source of the maple syrup and the method of its production can contribute to the unique characteristics of the maple cream. Syrup sourced from specific regions, such as Vermont or Quebec, is often associated with high quality due to the area's maple sugaring heritage.

Traditional production methods, such as boiling the syrup over a wood-fired evaporator, can also impart a distinctive flavor profile. Look for information about the origin and production process on the product label to gain insights into its quality and authenticity.## Core Benefits

Maple cream offers several practical benefits that make it a desirable pantry staple.

**Versatile Sweetener:** Maple cream functions as a versatile sweetener for a wide range of culinary applications. Unlike granular sugar, its spreadable consistency makes it easy to incorporate directly into toast, pancakes, waffles, or yogurt.It can also be used to sweeten beverages like coffee and tea.

Moreover,maple cream's distinctive maple flavor adds depth and complexity to baked goods,icings,and sauces. Its natural sweetness provides a healthier, more nuanced alternative to refined sugars.

**Natural and Wholesome:** Made solely from pure maple syrup, maple cream offers a natural and wholesome alternative to processed spreads and sweeteners. It contains no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. This appeal makes it a suitable choice for health-conscious consumers seeking clean-label products.

Maple syrup naturally contains antioxidants and minerals such as manganese and zinc, adding nutritional value to the cream. Its low glycemic index compared to refined sugars may also provide a more sustained energy release.

**Enhanced Flavor Profile:** The unique flavor profile of maple cream sets it apart from other sweeteners and spreads. Its delicate sweetness is complemented by nuanced notes of caramel, vanilla, and roasted nuts. This complex flavor makes it an appealing addition to both sweet and savory dishes.

As a notable example,a dollop of maple cream can elevate the flavor of grilled cheese sandwiches,roasted vegetables,or even meat glazes. Its distinctive maple flavor adds a touch of sophistication to everyday meals.

**Gourmet Treat:** Maple cream elevates simple foods into gourmet experiences. The smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture adds a luxurious sensory dimension to any dish, enhancing the overall dining experience.

Whether spread on artisanal bread or drizzled over ice cream,maple cream offers a refined and indulgent alternative to conventional sweet treats. Its unique flavor and texture make it a memorable culinary delight.

## FAQs Section

**How should maple cream be stored to maintain its quality?**
Unopened maple cream should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Once opened, it is recommended to refrigerate it in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out or developing mold. Proper storage helps maintain its smooth texture and rich flavor.

**What causes maple cream to become grainy or crystallized, and can this be reversed?**
Graininess or crystallization in maple cream usually results from improper crystallization during the production process or temperature fluctuations during storage. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to fully reverse crystallization.

Though, gently warming the cream in a double boiler or microwave (in short intervals) can partially dissolve the sugar crystals and improve the texture. Be careful not to overheat the cream, as this can damage its flavor and consistency.

**Is maple cream a healthy alternative to other sweeteners like honey or sugar?**
While maple cream and honey offer some nutritional advantages over refined sugar, they should still be consumed in moderation.Maple syrup and honey contain antioxidants and trace minerals, which refined sugar lacks.

However, they are still high in sugar content and contribute to overall calorie intake. Moderation is key when incorporating maple cream into your diet. People observing specific diets should always check with their doctors before starting any new food.

**Can maple cream be used in baking, and if so, how should it be incorporated?**
Yes, maple cream can be used in baking to add a unique maple flavor and sweetness. When substituting maple cream for other sweeteners in recipes, it's important to adjust the liquid content accordingly, as maple cream contains moisture.

Reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe by a corresponding amount to maintain the proper consistency of the batter or dough. Maple cream can also be used as a glaze or frosting for cakes and pastries.

1m919lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m919lk/does_the_aeropress_go_coffee_maker_really_deliver/,Does the AeroPress Go Coffee Maker Really Deliver Great Taste for Travel Review?,"The **AeroPress 15A01 Coffee Maker** quickly became a staple in my day-to-day coffee routine. As someone who loves experimenting with coffee brewing methods, having a compact, travel-friendly coffee press that offers multiple brewing options was an exciting prospect. From road trips to simple mornings at home, I tested this product thoroughly to discover its strengths and weaknesses. While it has a lot going for it, there are definitely a few aspects worth considering before picking one up for yourself.

**Design and Portability**  
This little coffee maker is surprisingly compact. The AeroPress Go is a sleek and well-thought-out device. Its all-in-one design includes a mug and lid that double as a carrying case, making it ideal for camping, travel, or even taking to the office. The matte gray finish adds a level of sophistication, while its lightweight construction made it easy to stash in my backpack without adding bulk. At just 11.2 ounces, it’s nearly unnoticeable when carrying it around. I’ve brought this coffee press to work, tossed it into my camping kit, and even taken it on flights without a hitch. That said, the plastic material, although durable, might not satisfy someone seeking the feel of heavier, more premium materials.

**Performance and Versatility**  
What impressed me most was how versatile this portable coffee maker is. It offers three brewing styles: espresso-style shots, regular hot coffee, and cold brew. In under a minute, I could produce a smooth, grit-free cup of coffee without bitterness. For quick mornings, it was a lifesaver because I didn’t need electricity or fancy gadgets. One weekend, while on a backpacking trip, I made myself espresso to pair with breakfast. The coffee was full-bodied and flavorful, thanks to the simple manual operation. However, brewing cold brew takes slightly longer (around two minutes), which, while still fast, might require a bit of patience on a busy day.

[Ready to snag AeroPress 15A01? See Amazon's price.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07yvl8sf3/)  

**Ease of Use**  
The AeroPress Go excels due to its simplicity. I followed the classic method: add coffee grounds and water, stir, and push the plunger. Despite being compact, its chamber can brew 8 ounces of coffee or 1–3 espresso shots with ease. Over time, I tweaked the recipe, experimenting with different grind sizes, water temperatures, and brew times. However, newcomers to this coffee maker should stick to the medium-fine grind recommendation until they find their “sweet spot.” Cleaning up was as simple as popping out the coffee puck and rinsing off the parts, which is something I appreciated during hectic mornings.

**Positives**  
Several characteristics stood out as significant strengths during my experience:  
- Compact and travel-friendly design.  
- Fast brewing time: less than a minute for hot coffee and two minutes for cold brew.  
- Produces smooth coffee without grit or bitterness.  
- Extremely simple to clean and maintain.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While the AeroPress Go proved its merit, a few things could be better:  
- The plastic construction, though practical, may not appeal to those valuing heavier or more premium materials.  
- It requires paper filters, which could be inconvenient if you run out.  
- The capacity is slightly limited for those who drink larger servings of coffee.

**Competing Products**  
In the realm of portable coffee makers, competitors like the Wacaco Nanopresso and the Bodum Travel Press each offer interesting alternatives. The Wacaco Nanopresso, for instance, focuses more on creating genuine espresso shots and includes a sturdy build. However, it involves a more complex operation and cleanup process compared to the AeroPress Go. Meanwhile, the Bodum Travel Press rivals the AeroPress in portability and ease of use but struggles to match its smooth, grit-free brewing results. The sweet spot for the AeroPress undeniably lies in its versatility and straightforward approach.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Something worth mentioning is how reasonable this coffee maker feels in terms of cost. With its BPA- and phthalate-free materials and smart design, it delivers an excellent balance of convenience and brewing quality for such a minimalist product. When compared to other portable options, this one definitely feels like a bang-for-the-buck choice. Its cost-effectiveness alone makes it a top contender for coffee enthusiasts on the go.

I spent years researching/writing ""The Tech Beyond Code"" —a deep dive into how technology evolved from primitive tools to AI, and where humanity goes next. It’s:  
- Not a dry textbook – Raw, fast-paced, and philosophical (think ""Sapiens"" meets ""Homo Deus"" for tech).  
- Provocative – Chapters like ""Tech as a Weapon of Empire"" and ""Will AI Rewire Human Desire?""  
- Cheaper than coffee – [$0.99(for US readers during countdown deal ends on 31st July) or FREE on Kindle Unlimited] (lowest price possible).  

Why I wrote it:  
Tech isn’t just about code—it’s about human instincts*. Fire wasn’t just a tool; it was our first ""software update."" This book connects those dots.  

Who’s it for? 
- If you’ve ever wondered ""How did we go from caves to ChatGPT?""  
- If you like big-idea books (Yuval Harari, Ray Kurzweil, Kevin Kelly).  
- If you want to think deeper about AI, ethics, and the next 50 years.

First of all, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. We can schedule a chat and I can show you some things [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuckcoxhead/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuckcoxhead/)

Here's the basic process... and yes, it's a process

FIRST AND FOREMOST: Networking is NOT about you. It's about WIIFT (What's In It For Them). So, is everything else in your life BTW.

They are wary by nature and you need to earn their trust FIRST. Trust the process and execute these steps faithfully.

1. Complete your LinkedIn profile 100%. Nowadays, hiring managers look at LI profiles. They are looking for someone and something that is different. If your resume and profile look basically like everyone else, then you are simply mixed in with the rest of the noise. That's not helpful. EVERYONE that you admire has found some way to differentiate themselves and stand out. Remember, your Education and Job Experience are where you came from (""below the fold""). You Headline, About, and (especially) Activity are where you want to go (""above the fold"").
2. Create searches in LinkedIn and save them. You can easily do this with a bookmark in your browser. You're looking for companies and people that revolve in and around where you want to be.
3. Systematically work your way through the folks in your search(es). Look for something interesting in their profile. This can be their Headline, About section, Activity (posts and comments), or Experience. If a post, add a comment that is intended to create or continue a conversation. A simple ""nice comment"" isn't going to cut it. Find a very specific thing and mention it in the comment. This creates familiarity with you. You may even do this for some time before tyring to connect with them. Then send an invitation request. Include something very specific in your request from their profile or feed. This improves your odds of them accepting your request. Why? Because you made it about them. Your objective with each of these is to create a conversation.
4. Once a connection is accepted, continue the conversation by asking a question in LinkedIn Messages. Make it closed-ended. If it requires a lengthy answer, they are less likely to answer. Remember, most folks answer these messages on their phone and typing long responses sucks. Be careful not to unintentionally close the conversation. Adding a Sincerely,... can do this believe it or not.
5. Ultimately, you want to ask for a conversation. I like to create a free Calendly account and simply share a link with them. You need to make it super easy for every step of networking.
6. When you get conversations, simply ask them to tell their story and see how YOU can help THEM, not the other way around. Remember WIIFT. Most will invariably reciprocate and ask you the same. So share your story. EUREKA! They asked the golden question. They will usually ask how THEY can help YOU. People genuinely want to help. Then you tell them.
7. IF LOCAL, try to move to IRL (In Real Life). Relationships are best made when you can actually shake hands and/or share coffee or break bread. Don't be creepy about it. Something like, ""Hey, if your ever in my area or I'm in yours, we should grab coffee or something.""
8. FOLLOW THROUGH!!!!!!!! If you ask how you can help them, and they give you something, then actually try friggin' HARD to help them. This grows trust builds relationships.
9. Keep Commenting. Send Birthday wishes congratulations on new jobs diligently. People will remember you if it becomes a habit.
10. Lather, Rinse, Repeat, EVERY DAY!

**Part 2 Advanced**

1. Understand your ""Why"" and Your Unique Point of View (PoV) about a problem in the world in which you want to live (aka your career destination).
2. Evangelize the problem with multimedia content, like micro-vlogging. Stay on point and grow into posting once every day.
3. Keep Commenting and sending invitation requests.
4. Find networking groups, virtual and IRL. Execute a similar process IRL.
5. NEVER STOP!
6. CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE!
7. BE HUMBLE AND LEARN FROM OTHERS
8. REMEMBER, Your goal is to create conversations and affinity. Do not fall for the lure of using Artificial Intelligence or simply becoming a SPAMmer or annoyance.
9. Be AUTHENTIC and always strive to differentiate yourself with a Unique PoV and Education. Although you are selling in a sense, never resort to selling. People hate being sold.
10. Don't forget to help others first and always be WIIFT.

DREAM BIG!

Which means that I need to find somewhere cool and easy to go where I can have a drink, maybe eat a meal, or just have a coffee. I have some stuff to work on so anywhere where I can post up for a while will be great.

I’ve never been to your city and I only know in the greater context of music and film. I love 90’s rock, I wanted to check out The Crocodile because that’s where Stephen Malkmus and The Crust Brothers played—but it seems like that’s strictly a venue space and not a bar open earlier. I plan on going to Light in the Attic records/KEXP while I’m in town.

I think my brother lives in or near Capital Hill? I’ve got no idea where that is or what the vibes like.

Thank you in advance, I’m about to hop on a flight with no WiFi so I hope when I land that I’ll have a few suggestions.

And if you ever need help finding a cool spot to post up in Chicago, let me know!",0,1753454690.0,Seattle,21,0.24,False

I’ve posted in here a couple times and I think I’m starting to hopefully get on the right path with our living room. We recently painted so it’s all the same colour (thank god) but now that I’m wanting to hang pictures (and eventually get a rug and pillows) and such on the wall I’m at a loss of the colour of frame. 

I bought these frames (I love the size/matting of them) but I think the wood colour frame may be a little too much in terms of matching with the coffee table and book case? Do you think a thin black frame would look better (similar to the one I’ve attached)? 

I know all this room needs is personality now and I’m excited to add it but I’m just hesitant on everything matching too much!

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

This is continuation of the post above (link above)

Firstly, I’m really grateful to everyone who helped me with various ideas on raising complains online.
It’s only because of these complains i got the car fixed. Thank you so much everyone.

Secondly, They called me yesterday in the evening that car is fixed and you can pick it up.

When i reached there today around 13:30. They were still doing some final touches on car.
Also there were few things i told them to fix. Mostly alignment related and they used a drill to fix that which was funny to me because that’s the first time i saw someone use a drill on car’s door/boot. Picture attached (pic 3)

Now, I made a mistake on last post. I attached wrong location of bodyshop.
This bodyshop & showroom, they’re about 600-700m apart, but this bodyshop doesn’t show up on google. 
So here’s the location of that service centre/showroom : https://maps.app.goo.gl/9L6XtUpoy5FDYLTT8

Now see picture 4-5, there is no marking on google but it’s there. I have marked the location from that service centre to the bodyshop. They have same name “Shri Shyam Motors” (VKI, Jaipur, Rajasthan).

Few people reached out to me about this location so I wanted to clear any doubts.
(I’ll also update previous comments about location in previous post, sorry)

Finally, It took them about 3hrs today to get my car “ready” while i waited. 
Behaviour was very nice. They didn’t have any coffee but they wanted to serve it haha. It was kinda funny how well they behaved today compared to the last time.
But The guy named “Rahul” still told me that work like this usually takes about the same time( more than a month & half) (no remorse what so ever)
But the manager there was very nice. He told me that few unfortunate events led to this delay.

The most important thing here is : 4 days ago on I made the previous post, they had told me “We’ll try to give the car by next week”
Here, it’s still “we’ll see attitude”, no fixed commitment and no fixed date on when car will be fixed.

After complaints on various platforms this same guy “Bharat”, called me in evening & told me that “my car will be ready in maximum 3 days”

Wow so the car could have been fixed way sooner but you guys just didn’t fix it cause why not.

I absolutely hated that he was trying to make me take down the complaints & post I made.
I simply declined.

Look at picture 6 now, strangely enough I still haven’t received any complain number from Tata. Not on my registered number neither on mail. I don’t wanna speculate so I won’t but people have received complaint numbers when they complain so I don’t know why i did not receive it, maybe it’s just my bad luck.

This was it folks. I don’t wanna ruin my mood over this anymore.
Safe the say I won’t be buying any of the safe cars from Tata ever again.
This was my last.

PS: Little trivia, The bill on paper was around 1.6 lakhs to insurer. I obviously had to pay just filing charges which were 1629 rupees.

- Trolley Square or nearby areas
- Around $1100–$1400/month for my share

Looking for advice and support Please!","In 2010 when I was 18, I took a year long job as a live in nanny in The Netherlands. During that year I met a Dutch man named Hans. We continued a long distance relationship and visited eachother once I returned to the U.S. Hans was verbally abusive and sexually abusive and it has left me with alot of trauma. I met Brad in 2014. Brad was very charming and not long after meeting him he told me I should leave Hans and be with him. Hans said I'd be happier being in a relationship with someone who lived locally. Once I ended my relationship with Hans, Brad confessed he was a recovering addict. He has a bachelor's degree for drug and alcohol counseling and was a counselor at an in patient  drug rehab center for a period. He ended up starting a relationship with a client and relapsed quickly once they started spending time together outside the rehab. His superiors found out and out of kindness they eliminated his position instead of firing him for starting a relationship with a client. The ex boyfriend of the client called the rehab stating Brad was having sexual relations in his office while the client was part of the program. This was false, however the client frequently spent time in brads office with the door closed. Brad was not this clients assigned councelor so this was still not appropriate. The day the client was discharged she gave Brad her phone so he could enter his number. He gave her his number and they quickly started a romantic relationship. This story should have been a red flag for me.The woman ended up dying from an overdose a couple years before I met Brad. 
His drug of choice is heroin. This was very off-putting. I didn't use drugs. I only smoked marijuana occasionally while I was in the Netherlands, where it was legal. I decided to support Brad and continue our relationship. After a couple months Brad asked me if I could give him a ride to some doctor appointments since he didn't have his own car. I agreed and began giving him rides when he needed. Then one day he asked me to drive him to the city to pick something up. Without my knowledge I took him to buy heroin from a complete stranger on the side of the road. When we returned to his home he told me that he had bought drugs and was gonna do some. I wasn't sure how to react. He snorted a bag of heroin in front of me. He acted like it was no big deal. I went home that night telling myself I can never see that dude again. Brad called me and said that he was struggling and relapse is part of recovery and he really needs my support during this time. I ended up seeing him again. After awhile he asked me to drive him to the city again. This time he said he wanted to buy a needle from a corner market called a Bodega because the rush was better if you injected the drug. He got the drugs and we went back to his place. He injected the heroin. He told me how good it made him feel. He asked me if I wanted to snort some. I hesitated , but eventually agreed. I ended up throwing up but after that I felt amazing… no more depression no more anxiety which I suffered alot from. I had had an abortion the previous year during my relationship with Hans.I hadn't wanted to get rid of the baby but he really pushed it and said he'd leave me if I didn't.
 I think the pain from that left me vulnerable, both mentally and emotionally. The next day Brad called and asked me to drive him to the city again.He got the drugs and when we got home he offered to inject me with the drug. When I gave Brad money and he bought heroin he controlled all of it. He always controlled how much I used and he always took alot more for himself. From that moment on for the next 4 years I used heroin and sometimes cocaine with Brad. He was very controlling and often aggressive and mean. But there were also moments of affection and what I thought was love. I eventually moved in with him and his cancer stricken mother. She clearly was an enabler and allowed Brad to live in her home and use drugs.  I think she was open to me living there so I could take on some of the responsibilities since Brad often had court dates, doctor appts or outpatient program. I drove him everywhere. She gave him money and would buy back all the things he brought to the pawn shop. I ended up pawning all of my possessions without being able to get them back and I handed over every paycheck to Brad. He would always say his money was my money and my money was his money but all the money he ever had was given to him by his mom while I had a job and earned mine. I had never been arrested or dealt with police before I met Brad. But once I got together with him that changed. Brads mom paid for him to go to private rehab centers over the years but he always relapsed shortly after leaving. She would threaten to kick us out but was too afraid we'd end up dead if we were living on the streets. Brads father used cocaine during most of his life. At 14 years old he started stealing it and using it himself. A friend of his convinced him to sell it to classmates at school too. Shortly after, Brad tried heroin after a friend offered it to him. So he used cocaine and heroin during the majority of his high school years. His father died from complications of his cocaine use when Brad was 17. In 2015 after an argument Brad put his hands on me. He strangled me. I ended up leaving him that day and tried to go to my parents' home.  They weren't home and Brad had taken my phone from me so I went to a neighbors to ask to use their phone. I must have been visibly distraught because they called the police. All I had told the neighbors was that I left an abusive partner. The cops observed handprints on my neck and went to arrest Brad. A protective order was put into place and I moved in with my parents. Unfortunately after the case was dealt with I went back to Brad and we ended up using drugs again. His abuse continued. Several walls in the home had fist holes punched through them and kitchen cabinets were broken during his many outbursts. On one occasion he even pushed his mother down on the ground whom was very weak due to cancer and chemo therapy treatments. He didn't put his hands on me thou,not since 2015. Once when I mentioned we should take some time apart he drove us off the highway but spun the wheel just short of crashing into a large metal sign. On another occasion he took a kitchen knife and cut himself over and over in front of me, blood dripping onto my feet. Brad had hepatitis c at this time also. I ended up contracting it from him later on thru a needle. I did get myself treated and no longer have the virus.We joined a methadone program for the first time in 2018. We wanted to try to have a sober relationship. Brad still continued to use potent marijuana concentrates and flower through our entire relationship. He got a medical marijuana card and would smoke several times a day.We started to have periods of sobriety from heroin and cocaine.  Brad continued to be controlling during this time. He would call me “dumb” “stupid”and a “fat bitch”. He was discharged from one location of our methadone clinic after getting angry and punching  a wall. I believe the damage was considerable enough that it needed to be repaired. Things seemed to get better when Brad wasn't using heroin and cocaine. At one point we ended up staying clean from heroin and cocaine for almost a year but his marijuana use was continuous. We relapsed a couple times after that sober period but then stopped at the end of 2021. We stayed sober and on methadone maintenance and I found out I was pregnant in June 2023. I had a miscarriage very early but became pregnant again 3 months later. I gave birth to our daughter in February 2024. We had some disagreements but nothing too serious that it resulted in physical abuse. He still controlled pretty much every aspect of my life but as long as I played by his rules things were OK. For example when I left the house I wasn't allowed to go anywhere I didn't pre-approve with him. If I wanted to stop at another store he would get really upset and mean. So I just stopped doing the things I knew would upset him to avoid conflict. He started to dabble in psychedelic drugs in early 2025. I was very much against this and didn't want any drugs in our home. He started using magic mushrooms,LSD,MDMA and other psychedelic drugs I cannot remember the name of and eventually ketamine. He kept trying to convince me to use the drugs with him. I adamantly refused but he never left me alone about it saying it will bring us closer together and make me feel better.At one point, years ago he had gotten bad with the ketamine but he gave it up. At the beginning of 2025 he found someone online that he paid in crypto currency to send him drugs in the mail. I pleaded with him not to do this but he wouldn't listen. He controlled all the money in our relationship. His mother left him a trust fund when she died from cancer at the end of 2023. Due to Brads long history of drug abuse, his mother felt a trust was the only way to guarantee that the money left to him would be used for maintaining the home and everyday expenses. His mothers brother is in charge of the trust. Brad started taking drugs on and off early on in 2025. He kept them in a safe in our bedroom closet.  I never opened the safe so I am unaware how much and what drugs were actually in there at any given time. I made clear I wanted no part of it.  We had disagreements about it on several occasions. In May 2025 he mentioned that the person online added ketamine to her menu. I once again said I thought it was a bad idea and for the sake of our daughter he shouldn't buy anymore drugs. He also stopped taking his antidepressant medication sometime in the beginning of 2025. He said that certain psychedelic drugs won't work properly if there are anti depressants in your system, so he didnt want to take them anymore. This is when I noticed a real change in him. He became even more agitated and paranoid. I think the stress of becoming a father and a homeowner after his mothers death played a role in his decision to start using drugs again. Brad started asking to go thru my phone to see who I was in contact with again. He became very suspicious of me cheating which I had never done during our entire relationship. Anyway, He started doing ketamine alot sometimes even before going to spend time together as a family.  One time specifically when we were about to go to the aquarium, he walked out of the bathroom with white powder all over his nose and upper lip. He was a total mess and couldn't even clean it off his face properly. I was so angry, I wouldn't leave with him until the drug wore off. Later that day he expressed his amusement about the incident. It was clear he didn't take the matter seriously. I expressed to Brad my desire to leave with our daughter if he didn't stop using. On June 13th 2025 Brad  strangled me while our daughter was in my arms. He previously misheard something I said and started to argue with me about it. He got very angry saying I was trying to alter his reality. After he let go of my neck and realized what he had just done he said “I'm going to have to kill you I'm sorry”. I started to panic and cry . At this point Brad started to apologize and freaked out about what he just did and threatened to do to me. I sat down on the couch in complete shock. He kept apologizing and saying if I didn't trigger him he wouldn't have hurt me. I  almost allowed him to convince me it was my fault and wouldn't happen again as long as I didn't make him angry. After years of manipulation and gaslighting I tried to justify in my mind what he did. I became very tired and wanted to go to bed after an hour or so of him coming up with excuses and apologies. I said I wasn't comfortable sleeping next to him. He took my phone but eventually gave it back. The next morning while he was still sleeping I snuck in the bathroom to take photos of the marks on my neck.  I hid the photos in a secure folder. For the next 3 weeks he watched me very closely, asking for my phone at times and wanting me to show him who I was calling or texting. I realized he was not going to change and I needed to leave with my daughter. Previously he said if I left he would kill himself by jumping from the bridge over the highway that was located just 2 houses down from ours.  I also remembered him running us off the road and cutting himself after the mention of separation. One time some years ago I tried to leave and he jumped on the roof of our house and took my car keys with him. The police had to come and talk him down from the roof. After that I did leave but returned some months later. I went to move in with my uncle who said his home was a safe drug free environment. He was lying. He offered me a crushed suboxone pill to snort the second I arrived at his home and meth later that night. He was high on meth all the time and I quickly realized I wasn't safe there so I went back to Brad who was begging me to return anyway. When I sold my car towards the end of 2024 Brad kept all the money. I asked him if I could finally have some of the money to open a bank account and to just have alittle cash on me since the only time I was allowed to have the debit card was if I went to the grocery store and I had to hand it over to him once I returned. I wanted to start building myself up financially so I could leave with my daughter when I was alittle more prepared to do. There were times I left the house , although not often with my daughter and had no money. He always had a problem with me wanting to do something or go somewhere without him unless it was grocery shopping or a doctor appt. It had been like that for as long as I knew Brad. I spent almost all my time home with him. I had no friends and only saw family members occasionally. I always had to have all the places I was going pre-approved by him before I left the house. If I made any other stops it would result in him getting very angry. I specifically went to the mall once to pick up an order and on the way out bought some clothes for my daughter. I knew I better call him to tell him because if I was gone too long he'd start calling and get mad at me. I have some of the texts he sent after that call.Anyway, on July 13th 2025 I mentioned the car money again…he didn't understand why I needed money if he took care of my expenses. After a while, he gave me 60 dollars but asked for it back to go get more ketamine since he got in touch with an old friend who could source it locally. I said no. We kind of ended the conversation with him agreeing that he'd give me 500 dollars slowly over time. My car sold for 6,000.The original agreement was to split the money. Even thou it was my car I felt it was fair to give some of my half to Brad for living expenses.But then once he had the money it changed to him saying he'd give me some money when I asked. But  when I did ask for money a couple months later for just 20 dollars, he got upset and freaked out. I didn't ask again for several weeks. He did said when I prove I am grateful enough to him he would give me some money. Anyway, back to after he gave me the 60 dollars. It was clear he was upset about it. I told him I needed a break and wanted to go to my mom's house for coffee…so I left and he called me on my drive over wanting to be sure I wouldn't tell her about what he did a few weeks back or about his drug use. I couldn't take my daughter because that would have been suspicious to him and he most likely wouldn't have allowed it unless he was coming too.I started talking to my mom saying Brad wasn't being very nice lately. She expressed her worry that one day she was going to get a call from the police that he killed me. That broke me. I ended up going back home and went to lay down . Brad wanted me to watch a movie with him but I said no. He was clearly high. He came in the bedroom asking why I was being so cold and also that I was only using him for his money and he wouldn't be giving me any more money. I said I finally realize that he's never going to give up even an inch of the control he has had over my life. He wanted to keep complete financial control over me. He told me if he's so horrible I should leave with our daughter so I said ok. He backtracked immediately saying no don't leave, don't take his daughter. He then panicked and picked up his safe and put it in his car. He said he had to go bring the safe to his friends house because he's afraid I'm going to tell people everything he's done and about his recent drug use if I do end up leaving so he didn't want anyone to find his “drug safe”.  When he drove off I called my mom and told her about the strangulation and she came and picked me and my daughter up. Right before my mother arrived Brad called me to check in and make sure I wasn't trying to leave.. I told him he needed to stay at his friends house awhile and I could hear the panic in his voice when he said that he was already almost home and wanted to know why I didn't want him coming home yet. It's obvious he suspected I was finally trying to leave. When my mom showed up we went immediately to the police dept to make a report. They needed to know why I had to leave with my daughter. I told them everything. I have pictures of him using drugs in our home and of the marks after he hurt me. I needed back up for why I need to have custody of our daughter for awhile while Brad gets help. I made it clear that if he straightens his life out he can see his daughter but for now I need to protect her. While I was at the police station my dad called my mom saying Brad was outside their house ranting and crying about wanting his daughter back. He tried to get in the house but the door was locked. My dad did not engage with him.  My dad called the cops and  they trespassed him from the property. The next morning I went outside and found drug paraphernalia that must have fallen out of his pocket. He left a small piece of a drinking straw that he uses to  snort ketamine right outside my parents front door. Imagine if my daughter picked that straw up and put it in her mouth.  I hope that the consequences of his behavior and the love I know he has for our daughter will be enough to motivate him to get well. Since writing this narrative I've had more time to think and reflect. There are a few more things that I feel are important to include.  A few times between 2015 and 2021 during drug binges Brad would lose track of where he hid the drugs or just simply ran out and would accuse me of stealing them or having them somewhere on my person. Neither were ever true. He would pat me down first, then make me strip naked in front of him. After that he would put his hand into my vagina to check if I was hiding drugs up there. The whole time I would be crying and he would keep apologizing saying he had to do this. I never was hiding drugs from him so I figured if I just complied with his strip and cavity searches the sooner they would end and maybe he wouldn't make me do it again. He also tried to sell me to men for sex on the streets when he didn't have money to buy drugs but I refused. One night a man gave Brad 1 bag of heroin to touch my breast. Since I've known Brad, anytime we'd play video games, which we did several times a week, he'd tell me what to do each step of the way. If I didn't do what he said he'd get loud and aggressive. I could never just play how I wanted during my turn. For several years, but especially during the last few months, I couldn't have privacy in the bathroom. He would walk in and ask what I'm doing often or claim he needed to use the bathroom right after I walked in to use it myself. Brad has admitted in several text messages that he's behaved crazy over the years and the night I left he texted me “ I failed you, I'm sorry.” These responses show an acknowledgement of guilt over his actions and behavior. A few days before I left, Brad was trying to get ketamine from a friend who didn't reply to him for a few hours. Brad had a complete meltdown. He was in literal tears and kept following me around  asking me what he did wrong for his friend to ignore him. He was absolutely convinced that his friend must hate him for some reason and he was never going to talk to him again. I tried to assure Brad that his friend is an adult with his own life.  I also said he must just be busy and to not take it personally. Brad continued to be very emotional for the next few hours and kept calling and texting this friend excessively.  When his friend finally did reply some hours later, Brad texted me saying “You were right. He was just trying to get in touch with Steven. He's so nice.  He knows my neurosis. He's used to my crazy.” It seems evident that Brad is not stable, both mentally and emotionally at this time. He was arrested last week for what he did to me a month ago and DCF is now doing an investigation. I got a lawyer and am going to get my restraining order extended and apply for custody of my daughter.

A month ago, she called me and said that I had “been on her mind a lot” and that she felt like she had to see me. She asked if I’d want to get coffee and when I asked what she meant by “get coffee” she said she wasn’t sure. She was out of town at the time but getting back in a month.

At the time, I was missing her a lot for the first time in a while and I said yes, especially because it sounded like she was reconsidering the breakup and I at least wanted to hear her out, even if we don’t get back together.

For the record, even if she does want to get back together, I’m not just going to take her back automatically. I’ll need to hear what she has to say. And even if she doesn’t want to get back together it’ll be a good opportunity for me to explain that we still can’t be friends.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a WNBA showdown that’s less *Space Jam* and more *Wall and Jam*—as the Las Vegas Aces (12-12) trek to Target Center to face the Minnesota Lynx (21-4), where the Lynx have gone 13-0 at home this season. Spoiler: This won’t be a road-trip movie. It’ll be a **home-court horror story** for the Aces.

### The Numbers Don’t Lie (And Neither Will the Lynx)

* **Lynx Home Dominance**: Minnesota’s 13-0 home record isn’t a typo. It’s a *threat*. The Aces, meanwhile, are a paltry 5-8 on the road—because “road” is just “L” spelled with more letters.
* **Implied Probabilities**: The Lynx’s moneyline odds (1.21 at DraftKings) imply an **83% chance to win**. That’s more certain than your morning coffee disappearing by noon.
* **Total Points**: The over/under is set at **160.5**, a meager 5 points below their average combined scoring (165.4). Expect the Lynx’s defense to turn Target Center into a **basketball version of Fort Knox**.

### Star Power, But Only One Star Will Shine

* **A’ja Wilson (Aces)**: The Aces’ star averages 22.4 PPG, but the Lynx are betting they’ll shoot under 20. With Minnesota’s defense ranked 2nd in the league, this prop (-120 for Under) is a **lock**. Expect Wilson to be met at the three-point line by a Lynx swarm bigger than a bee hive at a bonfire.
* **Napheesa Collier (Lynx)**: Collier’s averaging 23.0 PPG, a

1m90guo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m90guo/theyre_still_out_therethe_end/,They're still out there.....The End,"Even now, I can't believe that Freddy actually sold us—the entire village—to these... things. I don't know how he could believe they'd keep their word, but it's clear he missed Mary deeply. So deeply, in fact, that even after all these years, he would probably do anything to get her back—or at least see her one last time. Even if it meant signing a contract with literal devils.

But the Freddy I once knew was long gone, and there was nothing any of us could do to change his mind. Michael and I stood there, our hands raised slightly, as Freddy kept the shotgun trained on us. He wasn't pulling the trigger—at least not yet—but I knew that if we made a single wrong move, we'd probably be done for.

The air was thick with tension and the weight of unspoken consequences that loomed ahead. After several seconds—though they dragged on like minutes—I finally spoke, still clinging to the naive hope that I could change the old man's mind.

""Please, Freddy,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""I understand how deeply you miss your wife... but this isn't the way. She's gone, Freddy. They're just—they're probably using you.""

""They might be,"" Freddy said, ""but it's a small price to pay for such a great reward—seeing my wife again, even if it's just one more time.""

""A small price?!"" Michael shouted in disbelief. ""So our lives? The lives of everyone here? That's a small price to you?! ""You're fucking insane!!"" Michael's voice cracked with fury, the words echoing louder than the silence that followed.

Freddy, however, didn't answer. He had likely already come to terms with what he'd done—and with the consequences that were bound to follow. But before any of us could speak or move, the silence shattered with a scream of pure terror coming from the house next door.

Michael and I froze, exchanging a fearful glance. The scream most likely belonged to Miss Nathalia—she lived next door with her husband, Eric.

I didn't know what was happening, not yet. But then Freddy's eyes drifted toward the direction of the scream, even though there wasn't a window. And slowly... he smiled. Just a little.

The words that followed sent chills down my spine.

""They're here,"" he said—calmly, almost joyfully.

I tried to move—just slightly, quietly—but Freddy snapped the shotgun back toward me, shaking his head.

""Ah-ah-ah,"" he warned. ""Don't make this harder than it has to be. I didn't want it to come to this... violent way. But you made me.""

Then another scream tore through the air from just outside. There were frantic footsteps, someone running—but I couldn't tell who it was. The scream appeared and vanished just as quickly, swallowed by shadows.

Then i could've sworn I saw something dart past the living room window—just a blur, but enough to draw everyone's attention.

That was our chance.

Michael didn't hesitate. He grabbed his cup of coffee and hurled it at Freddy's face. The boiling liquid hit him squarely, burning his skin. Freddy let out a scream of pain, dropping the shotgun as he clutched his scalded face and staggered backward.

I lunged toward the shotgun, fingers closing around it just in time—but Freddy, his face twisted in burned agony and desperate fury, grabbed the barrel with surprising strength.

Before I could pull the trigger, he shoved it upward, blocking the shot. Despite his age, he fought like a man possessed. We wrestled for control, arms locked in a brutal struggle.

Then—bang!

Someone's hand slipped, the trigger jerked, and the shotgun fired into the ceiling. The deafening blast echoed through the house, leaving behind a ragged hole in celling above us,

Tiny fragments of wood fell onto our shoulders and faces.

Thankfully, Michael didn't left me alone. With a quick and brutal assault, he slammed into Freddy, sending both of them crashing to the floor—and making me drop the shotgun in the chaos.

Both of them scrambled to get up, but Michael was faster. He drove his foot into Freddy's face with a forceful kick, likely breaking his nose.

I snatched the shotgun off the floor and aimed it at Freddy—hands shaking, breath short—but I didn't pull the trigger. Not yet.

Freddy lay there, dazed, clutching his bleeding nose. Slowly, his eyes flickered open—just enough to see the shotgun aimed directly at his face.

He extended his trembling hands forward, voice quivering.

""Please..."" he said, shaking. ""Don't do this, boy. It ain't worth it.""

Michael, still catching his breath, let out a dry, sarcastic chuckle. ""Not worth it, huh?"" he spat. ""After you nearly killed us, you've still got the guts to say that—after everything you've done, you old fool.""

However, I wasn't sure what to do with him next. If he tried anything—which I doubted, given his current state—I'd probably just shoot him. But... I didn't know.

We didn't have time to think it through anyway.

A scream, louder than before, pierced the air from outside. Then came furious pounding on the door—desperate pleas, screams for help, and the unmistakable sound of raw, pure terror.

But what came next...  god, those sounds still echo in my head even now.

First, a tremendous crash against the door—like something charhed into it whith the person outside. Then came another scream, even louder than before. It started as pure terror... and twisted swiftly into agony, louder than the shotgun blast itself.

In the following seconds, we heard the unmistakable sounds of flesh being ripped apart. Screams turned into wet, gurgling cries—and then silence, broken only by a sickening crack, like a bone split clean in half.

We just stood there. Frozen. We'd never heard anything like it before... and it was terrifying.

Michael looked at me; I met his gaze and slowly raised a finger to my lips. Stay silent. He nodded, and we remained completely still—barely breathing.

Then Freddy snapped.

Out of nowhere, he began shouting like a madman. Wild, desperate, furious. Before we could even move to shut him up—

CRASH.

The door exploded off its hinges, slamming to the ground with a deafening thud. We jumped as the impact shook the floor. And whatever was out there... was now inside. 

The thought that something out there could smash the door down in a single blow was both unbelievable and terrifying—even if they were old doors.

We stood frozen, unable to process the violence that had just unfolded.

Then came the sound.

Familiar. Slow. Heavy.

Footsteps.

By that point, it was clear—the thing Michael seen in his house and i had seen in my garden was now inside Freddy's house.

We didn't dare look toward the living room. Instead, we began quietly backing away, each step slow and deliberate, trying not to draw attention.

I kept the shotgun trained on the wide entrance that led to the living room, finger tense on the trigger.

The slow, deliberate footsteps crept toward the living room—each step intimidating, calculated.

It knew we were here.

And it knew exactly what it was doing to us.

Just before reaching the room, it stopped.

Then, a slender, elongated bloody hand reached into view, curling around the entrance pillar. In the dim light, its long, dirty nails scraped deep into the wood with an unnatural strength.

Just as Michael had described—the skin was blackened, rotting in places,

We both instinctively stepped back in fear, and I tightened my grip on the shotgun—ready to blast that thing's hand off.

But then Freddy moved.

He rose slowly, weakly, groaning as he stood. His eyes weren't on us anymore—they were locked onto the nightmare at the entrance.

He took one shaky step toward it and spoke, voice hollow and subdued.

""I did as you wanted.""

Its nails dug deeper into the wall, scraping with purpose, as it began to reveal itself—inch by terrifying inch. First came its head, peeking out from the corner like a shadow dragged from some twisted, forsaken nightmare. Even now, my hands tremble remembering its appearance. It looked like something pulled from hell's own imagination.

Its head was black, drenched in long, tangled hair that hung like rotting curtains across its face. Through small gaps in the strands, I could just make out what seemed to be eyes—if you could even call them that. Tiny, hollow black holes. Empty. Watching us.

I probably should've just shot it already, but I was too paralyzed to do anything. It was like I was staring into the face of the literal embodiment of horror—because honestly, that's exactly what it felt like.

Michael stood a few feet away from me on the other side of the living room, equally frozen.

Then it revealed itself in full, terrifying glory. Because of its towering height, it had to tilt its head slightly downward. The body was... monstrous.

Its limbs—long, disturbingly long and slender. Its chest was black and sunken, like it hadn't eaten in days.

And still, it managed to bring down the entire door in a single second.

However, its attention was drawn to Freddy's voice as he stepped slightly closer—trembling in fear, yet clinging to the hope of receiving the reward he'd been promised.

""I... I did what you asked,"" he said, his voice faltering as he dropped weakly to his knees, almost as if worshiping a god.

""I want to see my Mary. You promised I could meet with her again.""

Even now, I'm not sure if, in that moment, Freddy truly believed he would see his Mary again—especially considering the way the creature was staring at him.

But... that hope was likely shattered in an instant, as the sound of tearing flesh echoed through the house.

Like a flash of lightning, the creature thrust its long hand straight through his belly. Blood splattered across the living room furniture, even landing on my face, as its hand ripped clean through Freddy's body.

Freddy didn't scream. Instead, he simply stared down at the hand lodged in his belly before slowly lifting his gaze to meet the creature's eyes.

It hoisted him up effortlessly, still impaling him, with a strength that was terrifyingly unnatural.

I could hear Freddy choking—softly, painfully—as blood probraly began leaking from his mouth.

I stood there frozen, pure terror etched across my face.

I should've shot the creature—but Freddy's body was blocking my aim. Then again, even if I had, it might've been a mercy... a mercy I still don't know if he deserved.

Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder—Michael. He was dragging me toward the back door. I followed him, but turned slightly to glance back. Freddy was still choking on his blood.

And with what little strength he had left, he croaked, ""Y... you promised... M... Mary...""

The creature tilted its head ever so slightly, almost like it was nodding in acknowledgment. Then, it extended its second hand toward Freddy's inner jaw.

Its slender fingers wrapped around it. And with a brutal, effortless motion—it ripped it off.

And in the end, he probably got what he was promised. They kept their word. They let him meet his Mary.

I still stood there, mouth agape at the sheer brutality of what had just happened. But Michael—always quicker to act—yanked me in front of him and started pushing me toward the door, desperate to drag us away from the fate that had just claimed Freddy.

I lunged at the back door. Locked. No, no, no—shit! I muttered under my breath, grabbed the handle, and smashed my shoulder into the wood. It cracked but didn't budge.

""Move!"" Michael barked, both commanding and desperate.

I watched Michael struggle with the door, his kicks growing more frantic. But then... I felt it. Something behind us.

I spun around.

The creature stood in the hallway, silent and unmoving—blocking the other escape route. Its hands were slick with fresh blood, droplets pattering to the floor as it simply stared. No emotion. No movement. Just eyes locked on us.

""M...Michael..."" I stammered, voice cracking.

He glanced over his shoulder. His eyes widened—pure terror—and he turned back to the door, hammering at it even harder, faster, desperate to break us free before that thing made its move.

The blast lit the room like lightning. The sound cracked through the house, a thunderous roar in the silence. The creature's head jerked back as blood sprayed across the wallpaper.

But instead of falling... it just stumbled backward.

I was certain I'd hit it—right in the head.

And yet, it didn't go down. Finally, Michael slammed his boot into the door—splinters flew—and with a shout that cut through the chaos, he roared: ""Run, Jackie!""

No time to check if the creature was down. No time for second guesses.

I bolted after him, out of Freddy's house and into the night of nightmares, and our only goal- was to survive.

I couldn't tell if the creature had followed us. I didn't hear anything behind us—but I hadn't dared to look.

We raced through the overgrown garden, vaulted the low fence, and spilled out onto a narrow, grimy road.

Then I glanced back.

It was still there—just standing at Freddy's doorway. Motionless. Watching.

Its arm rose, slowly, like a puppet coming to life, and that long, slender hand pointed at us.

I couldn't tell if it was a threat, a warning... or something else entirely.

But I didn't stop to figure it out. We ran—feet pounding the winding path that led to the main road. As we reached the road, the sounds grew louder. Screams of terror—pleas for help—and noises that no living thing should make.

House doors hung open... or had been torn apart. Inside, only darkness.

Across the street, we watched a man force open his upstairs window—desperation in his eyes—only for something to seize him and drag him screaming back into the black.

The neighborhood I once knew—peaceful, warm, familiar—

Had become a slaughterhouse.

""No..."" Michael whispered in disbelief. The air was thick with the scent of smoke and fire, and in the distance, one house burned fiercely, cloaked in flames that licked the sky. I don't know if I should call myself a coward—or something worse—because instead of helping, we just ran. We sprinted down the road leading out of the village, toward the path Valeria and the others had taken. Michael was slightly ahead of me, never too far, always glancing back to make sure I was still behind him, urging me to hurry.

Then suddenly, he looked back again—his eyes went wide with fear—and he shouted at me to run faster. I didn't turn around. I didn't need to. I felt it. Something was chasing us. We both ran with everything we had, and behind us came sounds that defied explanation. Screeches, guttural cries—twisted echoes from mouths that shouldn't exist. And then another sound... and another... each more warped than the last. Each one darker, deeper, more terrifying. 

The world behind us was unraveling, and all we could do was run.

I don't think I'd ever run faster in my life—and certainly not from something like this. The footsteps behind us kept closing in, closer and closer, and yet, every time it felt like they were about to seize me, they slowed... just enough to let us stay ahead. Like they were toying with us. Like this was their game—and they were savoring the chase.

My lungs burned with every breath, but I forced myself to keep going. And when we finally saw the edge of the village ahead, it felt like salvation—like the exit from this waking nightmare. Still, deep down, I knew the truth: even if we escaped the village, they wouldn't stop. Not now. They'd follow.

Michael reached the outskirts first, but just as he crossed the threshold, he tripped over something and crashed to the ground. I caught up moments later, shotgun heavy in my right hand, and with the left I grabbed his arm, helping him back to his knees. We couldn't stop. Not here. Not yet.

twisted into monstrous shapes. Each one grotesque in its own way. And some of them... were our neighbors. Or at least, they had been. But now? Like Amanda... they were something else entirely.

Their limbs bent in ways that defied reason, the kind of shapes that shouldn't be able to move—let alone run as fast as they had. Their eyes were either hollow black voids or glowing crimson slits.

And those smiles. God, those smiles. They weren't friendly. They weren't human. They were cruel and gleeful—expressions of pure, twisted joy in our terror.

 I still don't know why they didn't chase us in that moment. Maybe they wanted us to feel safe. Just for a moment. A brief illusion of escape—before ripping it away again.

As I helped Michael to his feet, we both stood frozen, breathless from our frantic escape. Eyes wide, lungs burning, we stared at the twisted figures ahead. They hadn't moved. Not an inch. Just... watching.

""Why... why did they stop?"" Michael asked between gasps, his voice barely rising over the pounding in our ears.

I shook my head, unable to tear my gaze away. ""I don't know. But we shouldn't wait to find out. Whatever they're planning... standing here won't save us.""

""Yeah... you're right,"" Micahel whispered, barely able to keep his voice steady. ""Just don't take your eyes off them.""

We began to move—slowly at first, cautious steps backward. Our pace quickened as the fear clawed up our spines, but not once did we drop our gaze from those things. I kept my shotgun raised, trembling but ready, trained on the mass of monsters that stood there, motionless... watching.

I couldn't count how many. There weren't just a few. It was a gathering—an infestation. And as we backed away, I couldn't help but wonder if, while we ran, the village had already fallen. Maybe everyone else was gone. Or worse—maybe all of them been turned into whatever these creatures were.

But one thing haunted me most: the absence. That giant black one—the creature that probraly had started it all. I never saw it among the crowd. And somehow... that was more terrifying than seeing it. Because at least then I'd know where it was. Not knowing? That was its own kind of torture.

We didn't stay to find out. The horror behind us was too still. We kept moving, stepping backward deeper into the dark, our eyes locked onto theirs. The road sloped gently into the woods, its shoulders thick with trees that seemed almost bigger than before. It was our only option—the path most likely to connect to something resembling civilization. A radio tower, a forgotten cabin, a fuel station. Anything.

But safe? That word had lost its meaning. Safety was once a house with locks and warm light. Now, it was just the temporary absence of monsters.

Once the distance felt wide enough—though who could measure dread in meters—we turned and sprinted. I kept my shotgun cradled tightly, Michael panting beside me, both of us propelled by terror and hope in uneven strides. But even then, our thoughts were chained to them.

They didn't follow- yet.

""We continued to run through the dark alleys of the woods with my flashlight in hand, which I'm surprised didn't fall from me during the chase. It was basically our only source of light.""

""During the walk, we didn't say anything at all—just quietly moved along the road while the woods around us were... too silent. No sound of crickets. No owls hooting. Not even the crack of a twig. The wind seemed to have died. It was as if the forest itself refused to make a sound, afraid of attracting whatever might be hiding in the shadows where the beam of my flashlight barely reached.""

""Seems like the woods are just as quiet as the few ladies I've told my flirty jokes to,"" Michael said with a weak, not-too-loud laugh, trying to ease the situation.

Though I wasn't sure it was a good idea—since we might not be alone out here—I couldn't help but snicker at the joke. It was the first time I'd laughed at anything since all this bullshit started. But... I'd be lying if I said I didn't appreciate the moment.

""And now I wished it wouldn't be the last joke he ever told. I... I miss those. I miss him. My eyes stayed locked on the path ahead, where the flashlight beam barely pierced through the dark.

I had no idea how far we were from the village—or how many miles remained before we reached any sign of civilization. But then i whispered the words softly, lacing them with a hint of sarcasm but never letting go of my wary demeanor. 

'Still no one falling for your charms, huh? That's surprising,' I muttered. 'Heard ladies love idiots.'""

Michael snickered. ""Oh, fuck you, asshole. But you might be right."" His voice tried to carry a familiar edge of sarcasm, like it used to when things were normal—but now, it came out cracked and tired. He glanced ahead, the faint beam of our flashlight jittering across the uneven trail. ""Think Valeria and the others made it to the station?""



""They should be back by now.If they were delayed... good for them. I wouldn't wish them to return to that place on anyone."" He didn't elaborate. He didn't need to. That place—whatever it had become now—was burned into both our minds.

Michael let out a long, frayed sigh. Everything that happened had done a number on us—not just physically, but also emotionally, 

And the truth was... I'd completely forgotten about them. Valeria, Elizabeth,Patrick the others who were supposed to take the forest road to the police station while we waited in the village for their safe return. I think part of me didn't forget so much as blocked them out.

I tried to think positively. Maybe they're fine. Maybe they made it. Maybe they're already calling for help. But each ""maybe"" felt more like a distant echo than an actual thought. The woods felt too silent. Too empty. 

But that silence was shattered by a distant sound—something was running toward us. Fast.

We froze. Looked at each other.

""Could... could it be one of the creatures again?"" I asked, voice tight with fear.

Without a word, I handed my flashlight to Michael. He didn't hesitate—pointed it toward the source of the noise. I raised my shotgun, heart thundering, vision darting between branches and shadows. Nothing yet. Just footsteps—rapid, deliberate, getting louder.

Closer.

Then faster.

I took a shaky step back, hands trembling, breath hitching. And then—

With a guttural roar, something lunged into the beam of light.

I didn't think.

I pulled the trigger.

The shot rang out, louder than any before. It echoed through the trees like a final warning.

Michael stepped back, the beam of light veering off for a moment. But I was sure—I knew I'd hit it.

He swung the light back. There it was.

A body on the ground, lying in a dark pool of blood.

We stared at each other, both shaken to our core. I raised my shotgun again, hands tight on the grip, and crept forward with deliberate caution.

The thing was twisted—its limbs wrong, teeth jagged like shattered glass, eyes like black voids that threatened to swallow light. But then...

The face.

My stomach dropped.

It was Patrick.

The same Patrick who'd gone with Valeria to the police station.

I stared at the twisted remains on the ground. ""Was..."" I mumbled, unable to finish the sentence. The fear had swallowed the rest. 

But where was everyone else?

Where were Valeria... Elizabeth?

Were they still alive?

Had they somehow made it out?

Or... had they met the same fate?

That question lingered like mist in my chest.

And while writing all this, I guess I'll never know.

Before either of us could begin to explain what the hell had just happened, a distant screech tore through the forest—monstrous and bone-deep, like something ancient waking from a slumber. Then another. And another. The cries echoed in waves, folding into each other with growing ferocity.

It was just like in the village.

That same primal sound, the one that told you instinctively to run—no matter where, just away. But this time, it was worse. The shrieks weren't only coming from behind us. They were coming from the front too. And then the sides.

We were surrounded.

Cornered like prey.

And honestly? I still feel like I am.

Our breaths caught in our throats, our eyes darting across the dense forest. The road behind us—once a lifeline—now felt like a trap. Every step on it brought us closer to those things.

We had no choice.

We bolted into the woods.

It was reckless. Dangerous. Probably suicidal. The trees were thick, and the underbrush clawed at our legs. But what were we supposed to do? Keep running along the road, praying we could somehow outrun them with a dying flashlight and just four shells left in the shotgun?

Hope doesn't hold up against jaws.

And waiting—standing on the open path hoping for daylight? That was nothing short of a death sentence.



We took that sliver of a chance, dove off the familiar path and into the chaotic uncertainty of the forest. Maybe the trees would hide us. Maybe the terrain would slow them down. Maybe we'd find something—anything—that could save us.

We didn't know.

But staying meant death.

And running... well, it was the only thing that felt like survival.

So we ran—into the darkness of the woods, clinging to the desperate hope of survival. Even with the flashlight, it was nearly impossible to navigate; we kept dodging trees that loomed too close and stumbling over uneven ground we could barely see. Branches smacked against our faces, leaves clung to our jackets, but we didn't stop. The screeches behind us grew louder, closer—I was certain they were after us.

I stayed behind Michael, and whenever one of us tripped, the other was there in an instant to help back up. The frantic sprint through the wooded alleys felt like it lasted forever, each step heavier than the last, until my eyes caught a flicker of light—not far ahead.

I didn't know what it was.

I didn't care.

I shouted, breath ragged and voice sharp: ""The light—over there!""

Michael turned his head, eyes locking onto the same glow I saw—and I knew, this time, I wasn't hallucinating. That flickering light wasn't another cruel trick of fear; it was real. We clung to the last shreds of energy left in our bodies and sprinted toward it, fast and desperate, crashing through underbrush, leaping over roots that clawed at our ankles. 

Looking back now, I swear the creatures weren't screeching anymore. Maybe I imagined that silence. Or maybe they had paused, savoring the rising hope blooming in our chests just so they could tear it away again—like they always do. They thrived on despair. And they knew just how to play with it.

As the cabin came into view, its silhouette emerged from the chaos of the forest—worn planks, the windowpanes flickering with unstable light,  It was large—two floors, squat and wide. A steady mechanical hum rose from the nearby garage, low and guttural. A generator. That explained the lights. Someone had been here recently. Maybe someone was still inside.

We didn't know. We didn't care. 



""Hurry, Jackie!"" Michael shouted, voice sharp and ragged.



But rom the roots of a twisted fir tree, one of them emerged—so suddenly it felt unreal—like the forest itself had spit it out. I saw movement before sound:  eyes gleaming white in the black. Michael's feet tangled, flashlight slipping from his grip, spinning in slow arcs across the earth. Then he was down.

The creature slammed him to the ground with brutal force. 

I turned toward Michael, terrified and frantic, and rushed to his side. His clothes were soaked in blood, his body trembling, but I pulled him upright and wrapped his arm around my shoulder. I didn't bother reaching for the flashlight—I just needed to get him inside. He groaned, then muttered a weak thank-you, telling me not to worry. That he'd be fine.



We reached the cabin door. I grabbed the handle and to my surprise—it wasn't locked. I swung it open and dragged both of us inside. My breath caught in my throat as I turned back for just one last look.

It was there.

Standing near the tree.

Tall. Slender. Inhuman.

Its limbs were impossibly long, stretched like wet leather pulled too tight. It didn't move. Didn't lurch or growl. It just watched us.

My eyes widened, heart pounding in my skull. I slammed the door shut with a kick, not bothering to lock it or block it whith anything, i knew if it wanted to get inside- it woudlnt be a problem for it

I knew that.

And still—I searched. For a hiding spot. For safety in a place that felt like nothing could survive in it.

My gaze dropped to a nearby open door—one that likely led to the basement. Not exactly the haven you'd hope for in a horror story, but you weren't in my shoes. Right then, it felt like the safest place in the world.

I tightened my grip on Michael and led us toward it. I flipped the light switch, revealing a narrow staircase carved in shadow. Slowly, step by step, we descended—me guiding him, 

At the bottom, I settled him against the wall. He coughed quietly, the sound rattling like brittle paper, and I squeezed his shoulder before rushing back upstairs.

The door closed with a hollow thud. I locked it. A meaningless gesture, maybe—but I didn't care. Let me have that illusion of control, even just for a second.

Then I turned back to Michael.

I dropped to my knees in front of him, heart racing. Blood soaked his shoulders, a smear of crimson slipping from the corner of his mouth—but then I saw it.

A wound I hadn't noticed before.

Deep. Ragged. Carved into his chest like a cruel signature left by the creature's claw. The bleeding was relentless.

""D-Don't worry, Jackie..."" he murmured through cracked lips. ""I've been through worse, buddy.""

He smiled—just barely. A ghost of his usual grin flickering like a dying flame. But the pain that twisted across his face betrayed him. He groaned, and my chest tightened.

Not in fear. Not because of the creature outside.

But because I was loosing my only friend.

""All right, all right,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. But I couldn't mask the tremble beneath the surface—panic was seeping out of me.

I peeled off my jacket, the small one I always wore, and pressed it into Michael's hands.

""Just hold this on your wound. I'll look around—there has to be something. Anything to fix you up,"" I blurted, desperation choking my words. My vision blurred, tears threatening to spill, but I forced myself to move.

I rose to stand—

And felt his hand wrap around mine. A squeeze. Firm. Intentional.

It pulled me back down.

""Stay,"" it said. Not with words. But with every ounce of fragile strength he had left, please.

Michael's voice was barely more than a breath. His eyes flickered, struggling to stay open, but he still wore that fragile smile—the one that once lit up our worst days.

""I... I don't think I'll see the next sunrise, Jackie,"" he whispered, his voice trembling like glass on the edge of shatter. ""It's... it's over for me.""

""No. Don't say that,"" I begged, the words spilling out, tangled and broken. ""You'll live. You have to. I'll figure something out. I just—""

But my voice failed. Shaking. Slurred. Drowned beneath the storm building behind my eyes.

Tears streamed down my face.

I wasn't afraid of the thing outside anymore.

I was afraid of losing him.

He placed his bloodied hand on my shoulder, fingers trembling, his skin cold and clammy.

""Jackie..."" he whispered, voice fraying like old cloth. ""You hobbit... It's been an interesting few years, hasn't it?""

I choked on a sob, tried to smile back through the blur in my eyes. ""Y-yeah... T-thanks to you,"" I stammered, forcing out each word like they were too heavy to lift.

He chuckled—barely a breath, really. The echo of laughter we used to share.

""At least..."" he rasped, his smile beginning to fade, tone falling with it, ""I'll die with my best friend next to me...""

His grip on my shoulder loosened.

And then came the final whisper.

""Thank you... for... staying... with me.""

And with those final words, the life in his eyes... faded.

Slowly.

His head slumped to the side, and the grip on my shoulder fell away like a thread cut loose. I stared at him, breath caught somewhere between hope and disbelief.

""Michael..."" I said, softer than a whisper.

""Michael!"" I shouted, shaking him, desperate, clinging to the fragile hope that this was one of his sick jokes. That he'd open his eyes and laugh at how dramatic I was being.

But nothing.

Tears streamed down my face, blurring the world, burning as they fell.

This was real.

He was gone.

Even now, as I write this, a tear falls onto the paper—leaves a mark.

Just like he did.

I bowed my head, hand still resting on his shoulder... and.... I cried.

Not just for the blood on his clothes or the breath he'd lost—but for everything after.

He was the last person I could truly call a friend. And I hadn't even said goodbye.

So many words unspoken. The quiet gratitude for helping me find my footing when I first arrived in the village. The way he made this strange new place feel like home. Our ridiculous dream of flying to the Bahamas someday—just two best friends soaking in sunsets, sipping cold drinks, teasing each other while checking out girls.

That dream... gone.

All of it, gone.

 And then....I think I passed out.

Whether from exhaustion, shock, or the sheer emotional weight crushing my chest—I don't know. All I remember is darkness swallowing me, and then... waking.

A shotgun lay beside me.

And him—still there.



The light was gone from his eyes. The fragile hope that this might have been a nightmare... shattered. Reality came crashing down around me like cold steel.

Michael was gone.

I sat up slowly, arms wrapped around my knees, staring at him—still there. Silent. Still. For a few long seconds, I didn't move. Then I sighed and closed my eyes, just briefly, before standing. I grabbed my shotgun and headed upstairs.

I had no idea if it was night or day. I didn't care anymore. It felt like there was nothing left to lose.

When I opened the door, I was met with chaos.

Furniture torn apart. The front door, splintered and thrown open, led straight to the woods. Light filtered in, muted by trees—I guessed it was daytime now.

The place looked like a bear had rampaged through, destroying everything it touched. But I knew—whatever had done this wasn't just a bear.

And honestly, I'm surprised the entire mess hadn't woken me. But maybe I was too far gone. Too drained. Too lost.

But as I turned to leave, I looked back.

Michael was still there.

And... I couldn't leave him like this. Not him.

So I dragged his body out—slowly, gently—and carried him to the garage. There, I found a shovel. It was rusted, but it would do.

The least I could offer him now... was a burial outside the house.

He deserved that much.

I don't know how long I dug. Time lost all meaning. My arms ached, my mind blanked, and the world fell silent.

It didn't matter.

Once the work was done, I stood over the place where I buried my friend. I whispered, ""Thank you... for being my friend.""

Then I dropped the shovel.

Inside, I locked myself in the bathroom. The bottle of whiskey I'd found in the kitchen was still cold in my hand. My shotgun lay nearby—just a few shells left.

Outside, the woods waited. Whatever came next... it was inevitable.

In the cabinet below the sink, I found an old notepad and a pencil.

I didn't plan to write. I just started. Words spilled out, driven by something I couldn't name.

Yeah, I should've probably tried to reach the police station while there was still daylight. But time feels different now—warped, empty.

If Patrick became one of those things... then maybe everything else lost its meaning, too.

Still, before it all ends, I'll write. About the past few days. About the fall. Not because I think someone will read it.

But because it's the only thing left to do.

And here I am, in an old house in the middle of the woods—with nothing but whiskey, notes, my shotgun, and the thoughts I write on paper before... ending it all.

It's dark now. The generator is barely holding up.

This... was my story. A story that nobody will ever know.

I feel them outside already—watching through the window. But I'm not looking. Not... again.

These are my last words.

If anyone ever finds this note... Know this— They're still out there.

With those final words, Jackie placed the notes on the bathroom counter and reached for his shotgun—two shells left.

He stared at it, long and hard. As if it was the only thing that could offer death... but also peace from the nightmare he'd been living in.

Slowly, he raised it.

He placed the barrel inside his mouth, eyes closed, breath shallow.

His finger found the trigger.

But when he was about to press it... He stopped.

He should've pulled the trigger already. But even after everything... he couldn't.

It was like some invisible force held him back.

By dying, he'd finally escape the horrors. Maybe find peace. Maybe—just maybe—even see Michael again.

But still...

Without Michael, he wouldn't have made it this far. Throwing it all away now felt wrong.

There were dreams he hadn't chased. Things he never did. And maybe, somewhere out there, a place still existed where everything was normal.

The Bahamas. The thought of visiting his father again. The thought of asking Valeria out, though he didn't know if she was still alive.

All of it... would perish. Just like him.

That's when he heard it.

A knock—soft, slow, deliberate—behind the bathroom door.

He froze.

His entire demeanor shifted in an instant, disbelief flooding my chest.

A voice followed.

Familiar.

Him.

""Jackie... Jackie, you over there, man? Open the door, you hobbit...""

""M... Michael?"" Jackie whispered, barely breathing.

He was dead. He buried him myself.

But hearing his voice again... it was something else entirely. A cruel trick. A miracle. He didn't know.

""It's me, Jackie, don't worry,"" the voice continued, smooth, calm, too calm. ""Open the door. We just want you with us... to be part of a family.""

Those words were strange.

Too calm. Too familiar.

Jackie stood frozen, shotgun trembling in his grip. He was torn. A part of him wanted to believe—to rush toward the voice,and pretend none of this was real.

But another part, the part honed by survival and loss, held him back.

Slowly, he lowered the shotgun a few inches.

""...Is it really you, Michael?"" he asked, voice thick, almost childlike.

Silence.

Only silence.

""Michael?"" he repeated, softer now.

Still nothing.

Jackie's breath hitched. The bathroom suddenly felt colder. The knock didn't come again.

""Michael...""

And then—

A sound.

The door burst open with a violent crash, followed by a crushing roar, something deep and sinister rushing toward Jackie.

A single gunshot rang out.

Three days later.

Reporter Log – Havenwood Incident It's been several days since residents of Havenwood, a secluded village in New Jersey, lost all contact with their families and friends from rest of the state. State agencies were dispatched to investigate, but what they found was chilling: an empty village, burned to the ground, no bodies, no signs of life.

The search expanded to a 20-mile radius. A nearby police station was discovered, destroyed from the inside—again, no suspects, no bodies. Footprints, however, led investigators to an old house.

It was in a similar state. Nothing inside... just dried blood, a twelve-pump shotgun, and a few scattered notes. No body. The notes have been submitted for further analysis.

Then came a breakthrough. A woman was found wandering in the woods—exhausted, starving. Authorities rushed her to a hospital. Later, she was identified as Valeria Delians, a Havenwood resident.

Following medical care, officers questioned her about what had happened. But she spoke little, her condition suggesting severe shock.

The only thing she said was... ""



""They're still out there.""



The end

Beginner Creator's guide to AI tools (before it's too late) 💰,"**Stop throwing money away! Beginner Creator's guide to AI tools (before it's too late) 💰**

Hey fellow creators! 👋

Ever feel like you’re just *shelling out cash* for tools and resources that promise the moon, but end up delivering... well, a self-help book that *only* includes exercises? Yeah, I’ve been there too! 😅

Let’s be honest: in the chaotic landscape of content creation, it’s easy to get lost in the shiny world of AI tools that promise to transform our hustle. But if you don’t navigate smartly, you could find yourself pouring money down the drain (*or into the abyss of subscriptions you forgot to cancel*).

So here’s a quick and dirty guide for fellow newbies to help you **work smarter, not harder**:

### 🛠️ The Essentials: Top Tools to Consider

1. **AI Writing Assistants** 
   - Think of these as your *creative sidekick*. Tools like ChatGPT or Jasper can help brainstorm, draft, or even polish your content. But always keep a creative eye on it—as in, check for the “human touch”! 
   
2. **Image Generation/Editing**
   - Services like DALL-E or Canva can turn ordinary ideas into stunning visuals. Just beware of overdoing the “AI art” – nobody wants to look like an overcrowded Pinterest board.

3. **SEO Tools**
   - Tools like Surfer SEO or Ahrefs can help your content get discovered. It’s like having a personal detective to find out what *people are actually searching for* (you know, like ""How to get rid of stains on my favorite coffee mug?"" because priorities).

### 💰 Dos and Don’ts of Spending on AI

#### Dos:
- **Do take advantage of free trials!** 
   - Most tools offer a test drive. *Take them out for a spin* before committing that hard-earned cash.
   
- **Do focus on what you need right now.**
   - If you’re a beginner, maybe skip the 5-subscription package and just start with the basics. At least until you figure out your niche! 

#### Don’ts:
- **Don’t buy into hype.** 
   - Just because everyone raves about a tool doesn’t mean it’ll work for you. Think of it like Gatorade – tastes great to some but not a fit for *everyone’s* game.
   
- **Don’t forget to *re-evaluate* regularly!**
   - Set a reminder every few months to check if these tools are still serving you. Toss what you don’t need—no more money wasted on forgotten subscriptions!

### 😅 A Little Humor

Ever find yourself at the checkout page, contemplating if you really *need* that $100 a month doodle software? Yeah, me too! Then I press “buy now” as if I was clearing the last piece of chocolate cake... and instantly regret it. #Relatable

Just remember, AI is here to *assist*, not replace your creativity. And the best part? By using these tools wisely, you’ll have more time to focus on what truly matters: **creating awesome stuff!** 

So, what are your go-to tools, or what do you wish you knew before pulling the trigger on that shiny new subscription? Let’s swap stories and learn together! 🚀",1,1753453109.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I’ve got a few thoughts about the 4:6 method. I just can’t seem to get it right.  
I’ve tried all three recipes a bunch of times, and I think I prefer the 45x5 one, but the coffee still tastes too strong for me — I’m looking for more clarity, or sweetness, or acidity.

I’m using the Ode Gen 2 and switching between 6 and 8 on the grind size. I’m using mineral water, tried both 50ppm and 130ppm, but the taste stays the same... I've tried water between 91-94

Is it just me? Is my palate broken? Or is this recipe just not for me?  
I’m thinking of trying 4 pours instead…

And lastly, I’m about to vacuum seal and freeze the coffees I’ve got. Any suggest for the brews ?

I'm going to the UK for a bit next week - traveling to Wales and spending four days in London. Since I love James' videos (especially the weird ones like where he tries super old coffee) I wanted to taste his coffee.

As far as I understand he is affiliated with Square Mile Coffee, but it's ""just"" a roaster, so you can't drink coffee there. He mentions Prufrock Coffee, but their shop on the website is empty, so I can't figure out whether they have his coffee.

Any other places I should check out?

1m90ctd,https://i.redd.it/jqm1y8e341ff1.jpeg,They're still out there.....The End,"Even now, I can't believe that Freddy actually sold us—the entire village—to these... things. I don't know how he could believe they'd keep their word, but it's clear he missed Mary deeply. So deeply, in fact, that even after all these years, he would probably do anything to get her back—or at least see her one last time. Even if it meant signing a contract with literal devils.

But the Freddy I once knew was long gone, and there was nothing any of us could do to change his mind. Michael and I stood there, our hands raised slightly, as Freddy kept the shotgun trained on us. He wasn't pulling the trigger—at least not yet—but I knew that if we made a single wrong move, we'd probably be done for.

The air was thick with tension and the weight of unspoken consequences that loomed ahead. After several seconds—though they dragged on like minutes—I finally spoke, still clinging to the naive hope that I could change the old man's mind.

""Please, Freddy,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""I understand how deeply you miss your wife... but this isn't the way. She's gone, Freddy. They're just—they're probably using you.""

""They might be,"" Freddy said, ""but it's a small price to pay for such a great reward—seeing my wife again, even if it's just one more time.""

""A small price?!"" Michael shouted in disbelief. ""So our lives? The lives of everyone here? That's a small price to you?! ""You're fucking insane!!"" Michael's voice cracked with fury, the words echoing louder than the silence that followed.

Freddy, however, didn't answer. He had likely already come to terms with what he'd done—and with the consequences that were bound to follow. But before any of us could speak or move, the silence shattered with a scream of pure terror coming from the house next door.

Michael and I froze, exchanging a fearful glance. The scream most likely belonged to Miss Nathalia—she lived next door with her husband, Eric.

I didn't know what was happening, not yet. But then Freddy's eyes drifted toward the direction of the scream, even though there wasn't a window. And slowly... he smiled. Just a little.

The words that followed sent chills down my spine.

""They're here,"" he said—calmly, almost joyfully.

I tried to move—just slightly, quietly—but Freddy snapped the shotgun back toward me, shaking his head.

""Ah-ah-ah,"" he warned. ""Don't make this harder than it has to be. I didn't want it to come to this... violent way. But you made me.""

Then another scream tore through the air from just outside. There were frantic footsteps, someone running—but I couldn't tell who it was. The scream appeared and vanished just as quickly, swallowed by shadows.

Then i could've sworn I saw something dart past the living room window—just a blur, but enough to draw everyone's attention.

That was our chance.

Michael didn't hesitate. He grabbed his cup of coffee and hurled it at Freddy's face. The boiling liquid hit him squarely, burning his skin. Freddy let out a scream of pain, dropping the shotgun as he clutched his scalded face and staggered backward.

I lunged toward the shotgun, fingers closing around it just in time—but Freddy, his face twisted in burned agony and desperate fury, grabbed the barrel with surprising strength.

Before I could pull the trigger, he shoved it upward, blocking the shot. Despite his age, he fought like a man possessed. We wrestled for control, arms locked in a brutal struggle.

Then—bang!

Someone's hand slipped, the trigger jerked, and the shotgun fired into the ceiling. The deafening blast echoed through the house, leaving behind a ragged hole in celling above us,

Tiny fragments of wood fell onto our shoulders and faces.

Thankfully, Michael didn't left me alone. With a quick and brutal assault, he slammed into Freddy, sending both of them crashing to the floor—and making me drop the shotgun in the chaos.

Both of them scrambled to get up, but Michael was faster. He drove his foot into Freddy's face with a forceful kick, likely breaking his nose.

I snatched the shotgun off the floor and aimed it at Freddy—hands shaking, breath short—but I didn't pull the trigger. Not yet.

Freddy lay there, dazed, clutching his bleeding nose. Slowly, his eyes flickered open—just enough to see the shotgun aimed directly at his face.

He extended his trembling hands forward, voice quivering.

""Please..."" he said, shaking. ""Don't do this, boy. It ain't worth it.""

Michael, still catching his breath, let out a dry, sarcastic chuckle. ""Not worth it, huh?"" he spat. ""After you nearly killed us, you've still got the guts to say that—after everything you've done, you old fool.""

However, I wasn't sure what to do with him next. If he tried anything—which I doubted, given his current state—I'd probably just shoot him. But... I didn't know.

We didn't have time to think it through anyway.

A scream, louder than before, pierced the air from outside. Then came furious pounding on the door—desperate pleas, screams for help, and the unmistakable sound of raw, pure terror.

But what came next...  god, those sounds still echo in my head even now.

First, a tremendous crash against the door—like something charhed into it whith the person outside. Then came another scream, even louder than before. It started as pure terror... and twisted swiftly into agony, louder than the shotgun blast itself.

In the following seconds, we heard the unmistakable sounds of flesh being ripped apart. Screams turned into wet, gurgling cries—and then silence, broken only by a sickening crack, like a bone split clean in half.

We just stood there. Frozen. We'd never heard anything like it before... and it was terrifying.

Michael looked at me; I met his gaze and slowly raised a finger to my lips. Stay silent. He nodded, and we remained completely still—barely breathing.

Then Freddy snapped.

Out of nowhere, he began shouting like a madman. Wild, desperate, furious. Before we could even move to shut him up—

CRASH.

The door exploded off its hinges, slamming to the ground with a deafening thud. We jumped as the impact shook the floor. And whatever was out there... was now inside. 

The thought that something out there could smash the door down in a single blow was both unbelievable and terrifying—even if they were old doors.

We stood frozen, unable to process the violence that had just unfolded.

Then came the sound.

Familiar. Slow. Heavy.

Footsteps.

By that point, it was clear—the thing Michael seen in his house and i had seen in my garden was now inside Freddy's house.

We didn't dare look toward the living room. Instead, we began quietly backing away, each step slow and deliberate, trying not to draw attention.

I kept the shotgun trained on the wide entrance that led to the living room, finger tense on the trigger.

The slow, deliberate footsteps crept toward the living room—each step intimidating, calculated.

It knew we were here.

And it knew exactly what it was doing to us.

Just before reaching the room, it stopped.

Then, a slender, elongated bloody hand reached into view, curling around the entrance pillar. In the dim light, its long, dirty nails scraped deep into the wood with an unnatural strength.

Just as Michael had described—the skin was blackened, rotting in places,

We both instinctively stepped back in fear, and I tightened my grip on the shotgun—ready to blast that thing's hand off.

But then Freddy moved.

He rose slowly, weakly, groaning as he stood. His eyes weren't on us anymore—they were locked onto the nightmare at the entrance.

He took one shaky step toward it and spoke, voice hollow and subdued.

""I did as you wanted.""

Its nails dug deeper into the wall, scraping with purpose, as it began to reveal itself—inch by terrifying inch. First came its head, peeking out from the corner like a shadow dragged from some twisted, forsaken nightmare. Even now, my hands tremble remembering its appearance. It looked like something pulled from hell's own imagination.

Its head was black, drenched in long, tangled hair that hung like rotting curtains across its face. Through small gaps in the strands, I could just make out what seemed to be eyes—if you could even call them that. Tiny, hollow black holes. Empty. Watching us.

I probably should've just shot it already, but I was too paralyzed to do anything. It was like I was staring into the face of the literal embodiment of horror—because honestly, that's exactly what it felt like.

Michael stood a few feet away from me on the other side of the living room, equally frozen.

Then it revealed itself in full, terrifying glory. Because of its towering height, it had to tilt its head slightly downward. The body was... monstrous.

Its limbs—long, disturbingly long and slender. Its chest was black and sunken, like it hadn't eaten in days.

And still, it managed to bring down the entire door in a single second.

However, its attention was drawn to Freddy's voice as he stepped slightly closer—trembling in fear, yet clinging to the hope of receiving the reward he'd been promised.

""I... I did what you asked,"" he said, his voice faltering as he dropped weakly to his knees, almost as if worshiping a god.

""I want to see my Mary. You promised I could meet with her again.""

Even now, I'm not sure if, in that moment, Freddy truly believed he would see his Mary again—especially considering the way the creature was staring at him.

But... that hope was likely shattered in an instant, as the sound of tearing flesh echoed through the house.

Like a flash of lightning, the creature thrust its long hand straight through his belly. Blood splattered across the living room furniture, even landing on my face, as its hand ripped clean through Freddy's body.

Freddy didn't scream. Instead, he simply stared down at the hand lodged in his belly before slowly lifting his gaze to meet the creature's eyes.

It hoisted him up effortlessly, still impaling him, with a strength that was terrifyingly unnatural.

I could hear Freddy choking—softly, painfully—as blood probraly began leaking from his mouth.

I stood there frozen, pure terror etched across my face.

I should've shot the creature—but Freddy's body was blocking my aim. Then again, even if I had, it might've been a mercy... a mercy I still don't know if he deserved.

Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder—Michael. He was dragging me toward the back door. I followed him, but turned slightly to glance back. Freddy was still choking on his blood.

And with what little strength he had left, he croaked, ""Y... you promised... M... Mary...""

The creature tilted its head ever so slightly, almost like it was nodding in acknowledgment. Then, it extended its second hand toward Freddy's inner jaw.

Its slender fingers wrapped around it. And with a brutal, effortless motion—it ripped it off.

And in the end, he probably got what he was promised. They kept their word. They let him meet his Mary.

I still stood there, mouth agape at the sheer brutality of what had just happened. But Michael—always quicker to act—yanked me in front of him and started pushing me toward the door, desperate to drag us away from the fate that had just claimed Freddy.

I lunged at the back door. Locked. No, no, no—shit! I muttered under my breath, grabbed the handle, and smashed my shoulder into the wood. It cracked but didn't budge.

""Move!"" Michael barked, both commanding and desperate.

I watched Michael struggle with the door, his kicks growing more frantic. But then... I felt it. Something behind us.

I spun around.

The creature stood in the hallway, silent and unmoving—blocking the other escape route. Its hands were slick with fresh blood, droplets pattering to the floor as it simply stared. No emotion. No movement. Just eyes locked on us.

""M...Michael..."" I stammered, voice cracking.

He glanced over his shoulder. His eyes widened—pure terror—and he turned back to the door, hammering at it even harder, faster, desperate to break us free before that thing made its move.

The blast lit the room like lightning. The sound cracked through the house, a thunderous roar in the silence. The creature's head jerked back as blood sprayed across the wallpaper.

But instead of falling... it just stumbled backward.

I was certain I'd hit it—right in the head.

And yet, it didn't go down. Finally, Michael slammed his boot into the door—splinters flew—and with a shout that cut through the chaos, he roared: ""Run, Jackie!""

No time to check if the creature was down. No time for second guesses.

I bolted after him, out of Freddy's house and into the night of nightmares, and our only goal- was to survive.

I couldn't tell if the creature had followed us. I didn't hear anything behind us—but I hadn't dared to look.

We raced through the overgrown garden, vaulted the low fence, and spilled out onto a narrow, grimy road.

Then I glanced back.

It was still there—just standing at Freddy's doorway. Motionless. Watching.

Its arm rose, slowly, like a puppet coming to life, and that long, slender hand pointed at us.

I couldn't tell if it was a threat, a warning... or something else entirely.

But I didn't stop to figure it out. We ran—feet pounding the winding path that led to the main road. As we reached the road, the sounds grew louder. Screams of terror—pleas for help—and noises that no living thing should make.

House doors hung open... or had been torn apart. Inside, only darkness.

Across the street, we watched a man force open his upstairs window—desperation in his eyes—only for something to seize him and drag him screaming back into the black.

The neighborhood I once knew—peaceful, warm, familiar—

Had become a slaughterhouse.

""No..."" Michael whispered in disbelief. The air was thick with the scent of smoke and fire, and in the distance, one house burned fiercely, cloaked in flames that licked the sky. I don't know if I should call myself a coward—or something worse—because instead of helping, we just ran. We sprinted down the road leading out of the village, toward the path Valeria and the others had taken. Michael was slightly ahead of me, never too far, always glancing back to make sure I was still behind him, urging me to hurry.

Then suddenly, he looked back again—his eyes went wide with fear—and he shouted at me to run faster. I didn't turn around. I didn't need to. I felt it. Something was chasing us. We both ran with everything we had, and behind us came sounds that defied explanation. Screeches, guttural cries—twisted echoes from mouths that shouldn't exist. And then another sound... and another... each more warped than the last. Each one darker, deeper, more terrifying. 

The world behind us was unraveling, and all we could do was run.

I don't think I'd ever run faster in my life—and certainly not from something like this. The footsteps behind us kept closing in, closer and closer, and yet, every time it felt like they were about to seize me, they slowed... just enough to let us stay ahead. Like they were toying with us. Like this was their game—and they were savoring the chase.

My lungs burned with every breath, but I forced myself to keep going. And when we finally saw the edge of the village ahead, it felt like salvation—like the exit from this waking nightmare. Still, deep down, I knew the truth: even if we escaped the village, they wouldn't stop. Not now. They'd follow.

Michael reached the outskirts first, but just as he crossed the threshold, he tripped over something and crashed to the ground. I caught up moments later, shotgun heavy in my right hand, and with the left I grabbed his arm, helping him back to his knees. We couldn't stop. Not here. Not yet.

twisted into monstrous shapes. Each one grotesque in its own way. And some of them... were our neighbors. Or at least, they had been. But now? Like Amanda... they were something else entirely.

Their limbs bent in ways that defied reason, the kind of shapes that shouldn't be able to move—let alone run as fast as they had. Their eyes were either hollow black voids or glowing crimson slits.

And those smiles. God, those smiles. They weren't friendly. They weren't human. They were cruel and gleeful—expressions of pure, twisted joy in our terror.

 I still don't know why they didn't chase us in that moment. Maybe they wanted us to feel safe. Just for a moment. A brief illusion of escape—before ripping it away again.

As I helped Michael to his feet, we both stood frozen, breathless from our frantic escape. Eyes wide, lungs burning, we stared at the twisted figures ahead. They hadn't moved. Not an inch. Just... watching.

""Why... why did they stop?"" Michael asked between gasps, his voice barely rising over the pounding in our ears.

I shook my head, unable to tear my gaze away. ""I don't know. But we shouldn't wait to find out. Whatever they're planning... standing here won't save us.""

""Yeah... you're right,"" Micahel whispered, barely able to keep his voice steady. ""Just don't take your eyes off them.""

We began to move—slowly at first, cautious steps backward. Our pace quickened as the fear clawed up our spines, but not once did we drop our gaze from those things. I kept my shotgun raised, trembling but ready, trained on the mass of monsters that stood there, motionless... watching.

I couldn't count how many. There weren't just a few. It was a gathering—an infestation. And as we backed away, I couldn't help but wonder if, while we ran, the village had already fallen. Maybe everyone else was gone. Or worse—maybe all of them been turned into whatever these creatures were.

But one thing haunted me most: the absence. That giant black one—the creature that probraly had started it all. I never saw it among the crowd. And somehow... that was more terrifying than seeing it. Because at least then I'd know where it was. Not knowing? That was its own kind of torture.

We didn't stay to find out. The horror behind us was too still. We kept moving, stepping backward deeper into the dark, our eyes locked onto theirs. The road sloped gently into the woods, its shoulders thick with trees that seemed almost bigger than before. It was our only option—the path most likely to connect to something resembling civilization. A radio tower, a forgotten cabin, a fuel station. Anything.

But safe? That word had lost its meaning. Safety was once a house with locks and warm light. Now, it was just the temporary absence of monsters.

Once the distance felt wide enough—though who could measure dread in meters—we turned and sprinted. I kept my shotgun cradled tightly, Michael panting beside me, both of us propelled by terror and hope in uneven strides. But even then, our thoughts were chained to them.

They didn't follow- yet.

""We continued to run through the dark alleys of the woods with my flashlight in hand, which I'm surprised didn't fall from me during the chase. It was basically our only source of light.""

""During the walk, we didn't say anything at all—just quietly moved along the road while the woods around us were... too silent. No sound of crickets. No owls hooting. Not even the crack of a twig. The wind seemed to have died. It was as if the forest itself refused to make a sound, afraid of attracting whatever might be hiding in the shadows where the beam of my flashlight barely reached.""

""Seems like the woods are just as quiet as the few ladies I've told my flirty jokes to,"" Michael said with a weak, not-too-loud laugh, trying to ease the situation.

Though I wasn't sure it was a good idea—since we might not be alone out here—I couldn't help but snicker at the joke. It was the first time I'd laughed at anything since all this bullshit started. But... I'd be lying if I said I didn't appreciate the moment.

""And now I wished it wouldn't be the last joke he ever told. I... I miss those. I miss him. My eyes stayed locked on the path ahead, where the flashlight beam barely pierced through the dark.

I had no idea how far we were from the village—or how many miles remained before we reached any sign of civilization. But then i whispered the words softly, lacing them with a hint of sarcasm but never letting go of my wary demeanor. 

'Still no one falling for your charms, huh? That's surprising,' I muttered. 'Heard ladies love idiots.'""

Michael snickered. ""Oh, fuck you, asshole. But you might be right."" His voice tried to carry a familiar edge of sarcasm, like it used to when things were normal—but now, it came out cracked and tired. He glanced ahead, the faint beam of our flashlight jittering across the uneven trail. ""Think Valeria and the others made it to the station?""



""They should be back by now.If they were delayed... good for them. I wouldn't wish them to return to that place on anyone."" He didn't elaborate. He didn't need to. That place—whatever it had become now—was burned into both our minds.

Michael let out a long, frayed sigh. Everything that happened had done a number on us—not just physically, but also emotionally, 

And the truth was... I'd completely forgotten about them. Valeria, Elizabeth,Patrick the others who were supposed to take the forest road to the police station while we waited in the village for their safe return. I think part of me didn't forget so much as blocked them out.

I tried to think positively. Maybe they're fine. Maybe they made it. Maybe they're already calling for help. But each ""maybe"" felt more like a distant echo than an actual thought. The woods felt too silent. Too empty. 

But that silence was shattered by a distant sound—something was running toward us. Fast.

We froze. Looked at each other.

""Could... could it be one of the creatures again?"" I asked, voice tight with fear.

Without a word, I handed my flashlight to Michael. He didn't hesitate—pointed it toward the source of the noise. I raised my shotgun, heart thundering, vision darting between branches and shadows. Nothing yet. Just footsteps—rapid, deliberate, getting louder.

Closer.

Then faster.

I took a shaky step back, hands trembling, breath hitching. And then—

With a guttural roar, something lunged into the beam of light.

I didn't think.

I pulled the trigger.

The shot rang out, louder than any before. It echoed through the trees like a final warning.

Michael stepped back, the beam of light veering off for a moment. But I was sure—I knew I'd hit it.

He swung the light back. There it was.

A body on the ground, lying in a dark pool of blood.

We stared at each other, both shaken to our core. I raised my shotgun again, hands tight on the grip, and crept forward with deliberate caution.

The thing was twisted—its limbs wrong, teeth jagged like shattered glass, eyes like black voids that threatened to swallow light. But then...

The face.

My stomach dropped.

It was Patrick.

The same Patrick who'd gone with Valeria to the police station.

I stared at the twisted remains on the ground. ""Was..."" I mumbled, unable to finish the sentence. The fear had swallowed the rest. 

But where was everyone else?

Where were Valeria... Elizabeth?

Were they still alive?

Had they somehow made it out?

Or... had they met the same fate?

That question lingered like mist in my chest.

And while writing all this, I guess I'll never know.

Before either of us could begin to explain what the hell had just happened, a distant screech tore through the forest—monstrous and bone-deep, like something ancient waking from a slumber. Then another. And another. The cries echoed in waves, folding into each other with growing ferocity.

It was just like in the village.

That same primal sound, the one that told you instinctively to run—no matter where, just away. But this time, it was worse. The shrieks weren't only coming from behind us. They were coming from the front too. And then the sides.

We were surrounded.

Cornered like prey.

And honestly? I still feel like I am.

Our breaths caught in our throats, our eyes darting across the dense forest. The road behind us—once a lifeline—now felt like a trap. Every step on it brought us closer to those things.

We had no choice.

We bolted into the woods.

It was reckless. Dangerous. Probably suicidal. The trees were thick, and the underbrush clawed at our legs. But what were we supposed to do? Keep running along the road, praying we could somehow outrun them with a dying flashlight and just four shells left in the shotgun?

Hope doesn't hold up against jaws.

And waiting—standing on the open path hoping for daylight? That was nothing short of a death sentence.



We took that sliver of a chance, dove off the familiar path and into the chaotic uncertainty of the forest. Maybe the trees would hide us. Maybe the terrain would slow them down. Maybe we'd find something—anything—that could save us.

We didn't know.

But staying meant death.

And running... well, it was the only thing that felt like survival.

So we ran—into the darkness of the woods, clinging to the desperate hope of survival. Even with the flashlight, it was nearly impossible to navigate; we kept dodging trees that loomed too close and stumbling over uneven ground we could barely see. Branches smacked against our faces, leaves clung to our jackets, but we didn't stop. The screeches behind us grew louder, closer—I was certain they were after us.

I stayed behind Michael, and whenever one of us tripped, the other was there in an instant to help back up. The frantic sprint through the wooded alleys felt like it lasted forever, each step heavier than the last, until my eyes caught a flicker of light—not far ahead.

I didn't know what it was.

I didn't care.

I shouted, breath ragged and voice sharp: ""The light—over there!""

Michael turned his head, eyes locking onto the same glow I saw—and I knew, this time, I wasn't hallucinating. That flickering light wasn't another cruel trick of fear; it was real. We clung to the last shreds of energy left in our bodies and sprinted toward it, fast and desperate, crashing through underbrush, leaping over roots that clawed at our ankles. 

Looking back now, I swear the creatures weren't screeching anymore. Maybe I imagined that silence. Or maybe they had paused, savoring the rising hope blooming in our chests just so they could tear it away again—like they always do. They thrived on despair. And they knew just how to play with it.

As the cabin came into view, its silhouette emerged from the chaos of the forest—worn planks, the windowpanes flickering with unstable light,  It was large—two floors, squat and wide. A steady mechanical hum rose from the nearby garage, low and guttural. A generator. That explained the lights. Someone had been here recently. Maybe someone was still inside.

We didn't know. We didn't care. 



""Hurry, Jackie!"" Michael shouted, voice sharp and ragged.



But rom the roots of a twisted fir tree, one of them emerged—so suddenly it felt unreal—like the forest itself had spit it out. I saw movement before sound:  eyes gleaming white in the black. Michael's feet tangled, flashlight slipping from his grip, spinning in slow arcs across the earth. Then he was down.

The creature slammed him to the ground with brutal force. 

I turned toward Michael, terrified and frantic, and rushed to his side. His clothes were soaked in blood, his body trembling, but I pulled him upright and wrapped his arm around my shoulder. I didn't bother reaching for the flashlight—I just needed to get him inside. He groaned, then muttered a weak thank-you, telling me not to worry. That he'd be fine.



We reached the cabin door. I grabbed the handle and to my surprise—it wasn't locked. I swung it open and dragged both of us inside. My breath caught in my throat as I turned back for just one last look.

It was there.

Standing near the tree.

Tall. Slender. Inhuman.

Its limbs were impossibly long, stretched like wet leather pulled too tight. It didn't move. Didn't lurch or growl. It just watched us.

My eyes widened, heart pounding in my skull. I slammed the door shut with a kick, not bothering to lock it or block it whith anything, i knew if it wanted to get inside- it woudlnt be a problem for it

I knew that.

And still—I searched. For a hiding spot. For safety in a place that felt like nothing could survive in it.

My gaze dropped to a nearby open door—one that likely led to the basement. Not exactly the haven you'd hope for in a horror story, but you weren't in my shoes. Right then, it felt like the safest place in the world.

I tightened my grip on Michael and led us toward it. I flipped the light switch, revealing a narrow staircase carved in shadow. Slowly, step by step, we descended—me guiding him, 

At the bottom, I settled him against the wall. He coughed quietly, the sound rattling like brittle paper, and I squeezed his shoulder before rushing back upstairs.

The door closed with a hollow thud. I locked it. A meaningless gesture, maybe—but I didn't care. Let me have that illusion of control, even just for a second.

Then I turned back to Michael.

I dropped to my knees in front of him, heart racing. Blood soaked his shoulders, a smear of crimson slipping from the corner of his mouth—but then I saw it.

A wound I hadn't noticed before.

Deep. Ragged. Carved into his chest like a cruel signature left by the creature's claw. The bleeding was relentless.

""D-Don't worry, Jackie..."" he murmured through cracked lips. ""I've been through worse, buddy.""

He smiled—just barely. A ghost of his usual grin flickering like a dying flame. But the pain that twisted across his face betrayed him. He groaned, and my chest tightened.

Not in fear. Not because of the creature outside.

But because I was loosing my only friend.

""All right, all right,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. But I couldn't mask the tremble beneath the surface—panic was seeping out of me.

I peeled off my jacket, the small one I always wore, and pressed it into Michael's hands.

""Just hold this on your wound. I'll look around—there has to be something. Anything to fix you up,"" I blurted, desperation choking my words. My vision blurred, tears threatening to spill, but I forced myself to move.

I rose to stand—

And felt his hand wrap around mine. A squeeze. Firm. Intentional.

It pulled me back down.

""Stay,"" it said. Not with words. But with every ounce of fragile strength he had left, please.

Michael's voice was barely more than a breath. His eyes flickered, struggling to stay open, but he still wore that fragile smile—the one that once lit up our worst days.

""I... I don't think I'll see the next sunrise, Jackie,"" he whispered, his voice trembling like glass on the edge of shatter. ""It's... it's over for me.""

""No. Don't say that,"" I begged, the words spilling out, tangled and broken. ""You'll live. You have to. I'll figure something out. I just—""

But my voice failed. Shaking. Slurred. Drowned beneath the storm building behind my eyes.

Tears streamed down my face.

I wasn't afraid of the thing outside anymore.

I was afraid of losing him.

He placed his bloodied hand on my shoulder, fingers trembling, his skin cold and clammy.

""Jackie..."" he whispered, voice fraying like old cloth. ""You hobbit... It's been an interesting few years, hasn't it?""

I choked on a sob, tried to smile back through the blur in my eyes. ""Y-yeah... T-thanks to you,"" I stammered, forcing out each word like they were too heavy to lift.

He chuckled—barely a breath, really. The echo of laughter we used to share.

""At least..."" he rasped, his smile beginning to fade, tone falling with it, ""I'll die with my best friend next to me...""

His grip on my shoulder loosened.

And then came the final whisper.

""Thank you... for... staying... with me.""

And with those final words, the life in his eyes... faded.

Slowly.

His head slumped to the side, and the grip on my shoulder fell away like a thread cut loose. I stared at him, breath caught somewhere between hope and disbelief.

""Michael..."" I said, softer than a whisper.

""Michael!"" I shouted, shaking him, desperate, clinging to the fragile hope that this was one of his sick jokes. That he'd open his eyes and laugh at how dramatic I was being.

But nothing.

Tears streamed down my face, blurring the world, burning as they fell.

This was real.

He was gone.

Even now, as I write this, a tear falls onto the paper—leaves a mark.

Just like he did.

I bowed my head, hand still resting on his shoulder... and.... I cried.

Not just for the blood on his clothes or the breath he'd lost—but for everything after.

He was the last person I could truly call a friend. And I hadn't even said goodbye.

So many words unspoken. The quiet gratitude for helping me find my footing when I first arrived in the village. The way he made this strange new place feel like home. Our ridiculous dream of flying to the Bahamas someday—just two best friends soaking in sunsets, sipping cold drinks, teasing each other while checking out girls.

That dream... gone.

All of it, gone.

 And then....I think I passed out.

Whether from exhaustion, shock, or the sheer emotional weight crushing my chest—I don't know. All I remember is darkness swallowing me, and then... waking.

A shotgun lay beside me.

And him—still there.



The light was gone from his eyes. The fragile hope that this might have been a nightmare... shattered. Reality came crashing down around me like cold steel.

Michael was gone.

I sat up slowly, arms wrapped around my knees, staring at him—still there. Silent. Still. For a few long seconds, I didn't move. Then I sighed and closed my eyes, just briefly, before standing. I grabbed my shotgun and headed upstairs.

I had no idea if it was night or day. I didn't care anymore. It felt like there was nothing left to lose.

When I opened the door, I was met with chaos.

Furniture torn apart. The front door, splintered and thrown open, led straight to the woods. Light filtered in, muted by trees—I guessed it was daytime now.

The place looked like a bear had rampaged through, destroying everything it touched. But I knew—whatever had done this wasn't just a bear.

And honestly, I'm surprised the entire mess hadn't woken me. But maybe I was too far gone. Too drained. Too lost.

But as I turned to leave, I looked back.

Michael was still there.

And... I couldn't leave him like this. Not him.

So I dragged his body out—slowly, gently—and carried him to the garage. There, I found a shovel. It was rusted, but it would do.

The least I could offer him now... was a burial outside the house.

He deserved that much.

I don't know how long I dug. Time lost all meaning. My arms ached, my mind blanked, and the world fell silent.

It didn't matter.

Once the work was done, I stood over the place where I buried my friend. I whispered, ""Thank you... for being my friend.""

Then I dropped the shovel.

Inside, I locked myself in the bathroom. The bottle of whiskey I'd found in the kitchen was still cold in my hand. My shotgun lay nearby—just a few shells left.

Outside, the woods waited. Whatever came next... it was inevitable.

In the cabinet below the sink, I found an old notepad and a pencil.

I didn't plan to write. I just started. Words spilled out, driven by something I couldn't name.

Yeah, I should've probably tried to reach the police station while there was still daylight. But time feels different now—warped, empty.

If Patrick became one of those things... then maybe everything else lost its meaning, too.

Still, before it all ends, I'll write. About the past few days. About the fall. Not because I think someone will read it.

But because it's the only thing left to do.

And here I am, in an old house in the middle of the woods—with nothing but whiskey, notes, my shotgun, and the thoughts I write on paper before... ending it all.

It's dark now. The generator is barely holding up.

This... was my story. A story that nobody will ever know.

I feel them outside already—watching through the window. But I'm not looking. Not... again.

These are my last words.

If anyone ever finds this note... Know this— They're still out there.

With those final words, Jackie placed the notes on the bathroom counter and reached for his shotgun—two shells left.

He stared at it, long and hard. As if it was the only thing that could offer death... but also peace from the nightmare he'd been living in.

Slowly, he raised it.

He placed the barrel inside his mouth, eyes closed, breath shallow.

His finger found the trigger.

But when he was about to press it... He stopped.

He should've pulled the trigger already. But even after everything... he couldn't.

It was like some invisible force held him back.

By dying, he'd finally escape the horrors. Maybe find peace. Maybe—just maybe—even see Michael again.

But still...

Without Michael, he wouldn't have made it this far. Throwing it all away now felt wrong.

There were dreams he hadn't chased. Things he never did. And maybe, somewhere out there, a place still existed where everything was normal.

The Bahamas. The thought of visiting his father again. The thought of asking Valeria out, though he didn't know if she was still alive.

All of it... would perish. Just like him.

That's when he heard it.

A knock—soft, slow, deliberate—behind the bathroom door.

He froze.

His entire demeanor shifted in an instant, disbelief flooding my chest.

A voice followed.

Familiar.

Him.

""Jackie... Jackie, you over there, man? Open the door, you hobbit...""

""M... Michael?"" Jackie whispered, barely breathing.

He was dead. He buried him myself.

But hearing his voice again... it was something else entirely. A cruel trick. A miracle. He didn't know.

""It's me, Jackie, don't worry,"" the voice continued, smooth, calm, too calm. ""Open the door. We just want you with us... to be part of a family.""

Those words were strange.

Too calm. Too familiar.

Jackie stood frozen, shotgun trembling in his grip. He was torn. A part of him wanted to believe—to rush toward the voice,and pretend none of this was real.

But another part, the part honed by survival and loss, held him back.

Slowly, he lowered the shotgun a few inches.

""...Is it really you, Michael?"" he asked, voice thick, almost childlike.

Silence.

Only silence.

""Michael?"" he repeated, softer now.

Still nothing.

Jackie's breath hitched. The bathroom suddenly felt colder. The knock didn't come again.

""Michael...""

And then—

A sound.

The door burst open with a violent crash, followed by a crushing roar, something deep and sinister rushing toward Jackie.

A single gunshot rang out.

Three days later.

Reporter Log – Havenwood Incident It's been several days since residents of Havenwood, a secluded village in New Jersey, lost all contact with their families and friends from rest of the state. State agencies were dispatched to investigate, but what they found was chilling: an empty village, burned to the ground, no bodies, no signs of life.

The search expanded to a 20-mile radius. A nearby police station was discovered, destroyed from the inside—again, no suspects, no bodies. Footprints, however, led investigators to an old house.

It was in a similar state. Nothing inside... just dried blood, a twelve-pump shotgun, and a few scattered notes. No body. The notes have been submitted for further analysis.

Then came a breakthrough. A woman was found wandering in the woods—exhausted, starving. Authorities rushed her to a hospital. Later, she was identified as Valeria Delians, a Havenwood resident.

Following medical care, officers questioned her about what had happened. But she spoke little, her condition suggesting severe shock.

The only thing she said was... ""



""They're still out there.""



The end

1m90car,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo/comments/1m90car/looking_for_90s_hiace_camper_van_owners/,Looking for 90s Hiace Camper Van Owners,"Hey Reddit 👋 

I’ll be returning to Tokyo soon and I’m hoping to connect with someone who owns a 90s Toyota Hiace camper van (ideally with a wet room).

I’m considering buying one of these in the near future (for export), and it would be amazing to see one in person while I’m in Japan. If you or someone you know owns one and wouldn’t mind showing it off or chatting about the build, I’d really appreciate the chance.

Happy to grab a coffee, exchange travel stories, or just geek out over vans.

Thanks so much in advance  🙏
