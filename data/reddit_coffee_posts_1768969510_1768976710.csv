1qiqe0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1qiqe0i/how_to_actually_quit_smoking_not_just_cut_back/,"How to Actually QUIT Smoking (Not Just ""Cut Back""): The Science-Based Strategies That Work","I spent years studying addiction psychology, neuroscience, and reading every book/research paper on quitting I could find. Here's what actually works, backed by science and real experience.



Most people don't know this, but nicotine rewires your brain's reward system within days of your first cigarette. You're not weak. You're literally fighting against millions of years of evolutionary biology that's been hijacked by a chemical. The tobacco industry spent decades perfecting this addiction. But here's the good news: your brain can rewire itself back. Neuroplasticity is real, and thousands of people quit successfully every year using specific strategies that actually address the root cause.



1. Understand the real enemy (it's not willpower)



Nicotine addiction isn't about lacking discipline. It works by depleting dopamine receptors, creating a cycle where smoking becomes the only thing that feels ""normal."" Dr. Anna Lembke's book ""[Dopamine Nation](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/152474672X)"" explains this brilliantly. She's Stanford's addiction medicine chief, and this book is honestly the best thing I've read on understanding why we get hooked on anything. The key insight: your brain needs about 30 days to start resetting its dopamine baseline. Those first weeks aren't about being strong enough, they're about surviving long enough for your brain chemistry to stabilize.



2. The ""date setting"" method actually works (when done right)



Pick a quit date 2-3 weeks out. Sounds counterintuitive, but research from the American Lung Association shows this dramatically increases success rates. During those weeks:



Track every single cigarette in an app like Smoke Free (this app is insanely good, has a craving tracker, money saved calculator, and a community feature). The awareness alone will reduce your consumption by 20-30%.



Write down the exact trigger for each smoke. You'll notice patterns: coffee, stress, after meals, driving.



Start disrupting one trigger at a time. If you always smoke with coffee, switch to tea for a week. Sounds small but you're breaking neural pathways.



3. Nicotine replacement is not cheating



The success rate for cold turkey is roughly 3-5%. With NRT (patches, gum, lozenges) it jumps to 15-20%. That's not failure, that's strategy. Your brain needs to unlearn the physical ritual and psychological triggers separately from the chemical addiction.



""Quitting Smoking & Vaping For Dummies"" by Dr. David Brizer breaks down exactly how to use NRT properly. He's an addiction psychiatrist who's helped thousands quit. Most people use NRT wrong (too low dose, too short duration). This book gives you the actual protocol that works. Best guide I've found for the technical side of quitting.



4. Replace the ritual immediately



Here's what nobody tells you: smoking isn't just nicotine. It's the 5-minute break. The hand-to-mouth motion. The excuse to step outside. The stress relief ritual.



Have replacements ready: gum, sunflower seeds, fidget toys, short walks. When a craving hits (they last 3-5 minutes max), you need a competing behavior ready to go. The [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) app is perfect for this, it gamifies building new habits and has a adorable pet that grows when you complete healthy behaviors. Weirdly motivating.



For anyone wanting structured support beyond apps, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is a personalized learning platform that pulls from addiction research, expert insights, and evidence-based books like the ones mentioned here. You can set a goal like ""quit smoking for good"" and it creates an adaptive learning plan based on your specific triggers and struggles. 



The platform turns content from books, research papers, and expert talks into short audio sessions you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to detailed 40-minute deep dives. You can listen during your smoke breaks (ironic but effective) and there's a virtual coach you can chat with when cravings hit. The voice options are surprisingly helpful, especially the calm, reassuring ones when you're white-knuckling through withdrawal.



5. The Allen Carr method (controversial but effective)



[""Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking""](https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155) has helped millions quit, including celebrities who've tried everything. The approach is psychological, not medical. It reframes how you think about cigarettes entirely. Instead of seeing quitting as sacrifice, you see smoking as the prison. People either love this book or think it's BS, but the success stories are hard to ignore. Worth reading even if you use other methods too.



6. Expect the 3-3-3 timeline



3 days: physical withdrawal peaks (irritability, headaches, insomnia). This is hell. Prepare for it. Take time off work if possible.



3 weeks: psychological cravings still strong but physical addiction mostly gone. Your dopamine receptors are starting to recover.



3 months: most people report feeling ""normal"" again. Cravings become rare and manageable.



If you relapse, you haven't failed. You've learned what doesn't work. The average successful quitter tries 7-8 times before it sticks. Each attempt teaches you something.



7. Identity shift over willpower



James Clear talks about this in ""Atomic Habits"" (not smoking specific but applies perfectly). Instead of ""I'm trying to quit,"" shift to ""I'm not a smoker."" Sounds semantic but it changes everything. Smokers trying to quit are in constant battle. Non-smokers just don't smoke. That identity shift makes decisions automatic instead of agonizing.



8. Get pharmaceutical help if needed



Varenicline (Chantix) and Bupropion (Wellbutrin) have 20-25% success rates. They work on brain chemistry directly. Talk to your doctor. These aren't for everyone, but they're legitimate tools that help thousands quit.



9. The money thing is real motivation



Calculate your annual smoking cost. Put that exact amount in a savings app like Qapital every week you don't smoke. Watching thousands of dollars accumulate is wild motivation. At one pack per day you're spending roughly $2,500-3,000 yearly. Seeing that money pile up makes cravings easier to fight.



10. Join the subreddit r/stopsmoking



The community support is actually helpful. People post daily check-ins, share struggles, celebrate milestones. When you're white-knuckling through day 4 at 2am, reading someone else's success story at day 100 helps more than you'd think.



Your brain will lie to you. ""Just one won't hurt."" ""I've earned this."" ""I'll quit again tomorrow."" Expect these thoughts. They're not you, they're addiction talking. The neural pathways for smoking are still there, they just get weaker every day you don't use them.



You're not quitting smoking. You're becoming someone who doesn't smoke. That person is healthier, wealthier, and no longer controlled by a plant rolled in paper. The you from 90 days in the future will be grateful you started today.",1,1768976671.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

William is so selfish. In Ep. 7 he was deadset on going on that coffee run just so he can ‘read his letter’. Him and Izaya have had plenty of opportunities one-on-one. Give someone else a chance! Jobu clearly wanted to run that shift.

1qiqcv8,https://i.redd.it/wo7xrwpibneg1.png,The Role of Hydration in Fitness and Health,"# Introduction

Hydration is important for helping good bodily health, physical performance, and recovery from exercise. Almost everybody's function depends on water- from digestion to temperature regulation to transporting nutrients. In the case of an individual exercising, appropriate hydration could be a success or failure during a training regimen. This comprehensive article will focus on hydration, exercise, [fitness and health](https://evolvebiolabs.com/), including tips for proper hydration.

# 1. The Basics of Hydration

# How Hydration Works in the Body

Water makes up approximately 60% of body weight and participates in all cell functions. Water regulates temperature, facilitates the smoothness of joints, transports nutrients, and excretes waste products.



Hydration refers to the regulation of fluids in the body, and the extent to which the cells of the body are operating. Small deviations in hydration induce a significant disruption in performance and health.

# The Function of Electrolytes

Electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and magnesium, keep fluids in balance. Through sweat during exercise, not only does water get eliminated but also the necessary electrolytes, and replacing these is equally as essential as hydrating with water.

# 2. Hydration Strategies for Different Activities

# Cardio Exercises

Hydrate with water before and throughout your cardio sessions. If engaging in high-intensity [cardio or endurance activities](https://medium.com/@emmaswift02/strength-training-vs-cardio-which-is-better-for-your-fitness-goals-5b0e51dac15d) (e.g., running, biking), use hydration drinks with additional electrolytes to avoid dehydration.

# Strength Training

Have water regularly during your exercise to help preserve muscle function. Try drinking water between sets when resting. Strength athletes (powerlifters or bodybuilders) should get well-hydrated before training.

# High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

HIIT demands a high energy output, and therefore proper hydration is important for optimal performance. Being that HIIT exercises are usually under 45 minutes, water will be adequate, but you might require additional hydration if the session turns out to be highly intense.

# Yoga and Pilates

Although these exercises do not appear as physically demanding, proper hydration guarantees flexibility and joint health, allowing you to execute poses with ease.

# 3. How Much Water Should You Drink?

# General Guidelines

**Daily Water Intake:** The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has recommended around 3.7 liters (125 oz) for men and 2.7 liters (91 oz) for women from all food and beverage sources. But it depends on conditions such as exercise, climate, and health.



**During Exercise:** Drink 200–300 mL of water every 10-20 minutes during [moderate to hard exercise](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolabs07/the-benefits-of-high-intensity-interval-training-hiit-abaf5cbf1cd4). If exercising for over an hour, include drinks with electrolytes.

# The ""8x8 Rule""

One popular recommendation is to consume eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, which is equivalent to approximately 2 liters. Although not for everyone, it's an easy place to begin.

# Adjusting for Your Activity Level

Think about increasing water consumption if you are exercising very strenuously or for long time. During extremely hot conditions and very intense exercises or workouts, you will require more fluid consumption.

# 4. Hydration and Physical Performance

# Impact of Dehydration on Exercise

**Decreased Endurance:** Dehydration decreases the body's heat-regulating capacity, leading to fatigue and impaired exercise performance.



**Decreased Strength and Power:** Mild dehydration alone can compromise muscle function, decreasing strength, power output, and coordination.



**Increased Risk of Injury:** Inadequate hydration causes muscle cramping and can compromise reaction times and concentration, raising the risk of injury.

# Hydration and Cardiovascular Performance

Adequate hydration allows the heart to pump blood efficiently, which is essential during aerobic exercise (running, cycling, swimming). Dehydration raises the heart rate and lowers stroke volume, causing the heart to labor more.

# The Importance of Pre-, During-, and Post-Workout Hydration

**Pre-Workout:** Start your workout hydrated to ensure you’re able to perform at your best. Drink 500–600 mL of water about two hours before exercise.



**During Workout:** For sessions lasting less than an hour, water is typically sufficient. For longer or more intense workouts, consider drinks with electrolytes.



**Post-Workout:** Rehydrate with water and, if needed, an electrolyte-containing drink to replenish lost water and minerals. A recovery drink with [carbohydrates and protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93carbohydrate_interaction#:~:text=Carbohydrates%20are%20important%20biopolymers%20and,structures%20are%20known%20as%20lectins.) can also help repair muscles.

# 4. Signs of Dehydration and Its Effects on Fitness

# Early Signs of Dehydration

* Thirst
* Dry mouth and skin
* Fatigue
* Dark-colored urine

# Moderate Dehydration Symptoms

* Dizziness
* Headaches
* Muscle cramps
* Reduced endurance

# Severe Dehydration

* Nausea and vomiting
* Confusion
* Rapid heartbeat or breathing
* Fainting

# FAQs

**1. Why is it important to stay hydrated while working?**

**Ans.** Proper hydration is essential in preventing heat illness. Drinking water frequently and eating regular meals is usually sufficient for hydration. For sweating that lasts several hours, sports drinks can help replace electrolytes that workers lose when working in hot environments.



**2. Can you be dehydrated even if you drink a lot of water?**

**Ans.** Yes, you can be dehydrated even if you drink a lot of water because your body needs electrolytes to maintain hydration. Other factors like medications, illness, and heat can also contribute to dehydration.



**3. Does coffee deplete magnesium?**

**Ans.** Yes, drinking too much coffee can deplete magnesium levels in your body. Caffeine in coffee acts as a diuretic, which means it increases the amount of urine your body produces. This can cause your body to flush out magnesium more quickly than it can be absorbed and used.

# Conclusion

Hydration is the secret to fitness peak performance and well-being. It boosts endurance, avoids cramping, and supports recovery. Understanding your body's hydration requirements and balancing fluid consumption with the level of activity ensures peak performances and outcomes. Hydration is a continuous process that fuels mind and body, so prioritize it for improved well-being and fitness.",1,1768976568.0,u_Evolvebiolab,0,1.0,False

1qiqb2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qiqb2r/ex_suddenly_broke_up_with_me_and_i_am_confused/,Ex suddenly broke up with me and I am confused and spiralling,"My ex (M 37) recently broke up with me(F26), about 2 weeks ago and I can't stop over analysing things and the feeling of, did I mess up. We date for about 3 months. In between, I was spending a lot of time outside of where he lives as I was still deciding on whether I'd live in his city or not(not because of the rel, but other things). Also, he was divorced that same year and only told me on our first date. We had been talking for some weeks before that so that was not expected but I was okay with it as he mentioned he's been working on himself. Our first date was nice, very thoughtful. However, the second date was a bit off, I made a statement that was meant to be a joke but he took it personal which I immediately apologised. Since I was new to his area, we decided to go check out some places but in the middle of it, I got some mild allergic reaction so I told him I would like to go to a coffee shop instead for the rest of my day and he seem annoyed and agitated and complained. 



From that date, I was freaking pissed and recall telling my friend I don't wanna see him again but still ended up going on the third date. It was also fine and I think from there, I saw that he was a bit emotionally insure and probably I needed to be a bit cautious about how I approach things. To be honest, I became more passive and wanted to learn more about him and evaluate if he's someone I wanted to be with. 

We were going out and I wanted to show some affection while we were in the elevator and he said he didn't want to so I was taken aback a bit and felt off and rejected but I apologised. He later on wanted to do PDA in public which I was receptive but passively because I just didn’t want to cross any  boundaries. When we got back home, he mentioned how I made him feel alone in that PDA moment. And he had told me he didn’t like PDA in the elevator before because of cameras(which I honestly didn’t recall and I was also a bit tipsy when we were going out).I was just honestly emotionally tired to say anything so I waited for as to discuss the incident in the morning. I told him how it takes me a bit of time to open up and I like to observe before jumping into conclusions, and if that must have come across of me not being interested in him, that’s not the case and I am going to be more open and expressive. He also brought all the things that I had done in that moment which I didn’t realised was a problem but again, I said sorry. In hindsight, I should have mentioned how uncomfortable I felt in certain situations but I didn’t.



I got home, sent him an appreciation for a nice time we spent and looking forward to learning more about each other, etc… I really thought we had cleared things. I decided to make some date plans for us for the weekend as he’s always planning and sent him the option and asked if it will work for him during the weekend. He replied saying no and he was not sure if he was going to spend time with his friends. Which was perfectly fine. I told him to let me know if anything changes. He followed up with a message, telling me the hours we had spent together that week and he needed time for himself. I was honestly confused why there was a need to mention hours we spent. I am very respectful of his time and if anything, I try to accommodate my plans for him as he has done that for me in some situations.  I was fine with whatever time he’d have for us to meet. I hearted the message and gave him the space he needed for the weekend. Fast forward to the following Monday, he just sent me a text about breaking up (his reason was, he felt this was not secure and consistent for a future relationship). Wished me the best, I replied confused and why the sudden decision, and he never replied, next thing I know, I’ve been removed from his socials.  
  
Now I am confused. I have spiralling and overthinking about all the things that transpired, was I rebound? Did I do anything wrong that I can do better in future? I am going through some self doubt here and would love an outside view on this. ",1,1768976404.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I need to be honest with you about something I've been wrestling with, and I hope you'll understand why I have to ask this question, even though I know it might hurt us both.

You've asked me to stay in your life as a friend, and I hear the sincerity in your voice when you say you don't want to lose me completely. I know you care about me. I've never doubted that. But I have to ask: why should I stay as just a friend when everything in me wants more? Why am I supposed to fold up these feelings like old letters and pretend they never meant what they did?

I can't watch you from the sidelines of your life and celebrate when someone else becomes what I wanted to be for you. I can't hear about your days and your dreams and your disappointments and offer comfort like some neutral party when my heart is still tangled up in yours. Friendship requires a kind of distance I don't know how to create when I still know the way you take your coffee and the sound you make before you close your eyes.

You might think I'm being dramatic or unfair, but I'm trying to protect something in myself that I can't afford to lose—the ability to heal, to move forward, to eventually open my heart to someone who wants all of me. Staying close to you would be like standing too near a fire I'm trying to let go out. The warmth would be too tempting. The hope would be too persistent.

I don't say this to hurt you or to punish you for not feeling what I feel. You can't force your heart any more than I can force mine. But I also can't pretend that friendship is enough for me right now, maybe not ever. Some loves don't fold neatly into friendship. Some doors, once opened, can't become windows.

So I'm asking you to understand if I need to step back completely, at least for now. It's not because I don't value what we had or who you are. It's because I value myself too much to settle for crumbs when I was ready to offer the whole table.

I hope someday you'll understand. I hope someday I'll be grateful for whatever time we had. But right now, I just need space to let these feelings find somewhere else to go.

With a heart that still cares, even as it says goodbye,

I'm a technical writer with 3.6 years of experience in the software supply chain domain and a master's in communications. I'm genuinely interested in transitioning into policy communications, even though it's a significant domain shift. I'm open to the challenge and excited to learn what this field offers.

I'd love to hear from people who've made similar transitions—whether from technical writing, communications, or completely different backgrounds. A few questions I'm curious about:

**On breaking in:**

* How did you enter policy communications? What was your path?
* Is a master's or PhD necessary to be taken seriously, or are there alternative routes?
* For those who did pursue graduate degrees in policy, what did you focus on in your SOP and thesis? How did you identify and approach potential advisors?

**On the work itself:**

* What are the biggest challenges you've faced in this domain?
* What are the ups and downs that people don't talk about enough?
* What should someone entering this field keep in mind?

**On networking and learning:**

* How do you connect with people in this space? I see many policy professionals active on LinkedIn—is social media engagement a real pathway in?
* How do you initiate ""coffee chats"" with people in the field? Any tips for reaching out without being awkward?
* How did you stay open-minded during the transition, especially when imposter syndrome kicks in?

I'm genuinely curious about diverse perspectives and experiences. Whether you jumped straight in, took the academic route, or carved your own unconventional path—I'd love to hear your story.

Last weekend, I was alone for 3 days. Holiday at work, husband travelling for work, weekend plans fell through.  

So, my mind started making excuses. Maybe it wasn't that bad. I am in a good mood, not drinking to not feel something. I was in a bad place back then, but I am not anymore, so maybe I will be able to drink in moderation. Just a couple of drinks to enjoy like everyone else. Even if I fail, I will be alone, so I can manage the mess. If I try and fail, I won't try again.  

Basically my mind was trying to make up reasonable excuses to drink. And I almost gave in. I called the liquor store and asked them to deliver a bottle of vodka to my home. And the man on register said ""hello xyz, it's been a while since you called"".  

And that's when it hit me. I had called this place so many times for delivery that they remember my name as soon as I said my address and vodka. Memorabke enough to be remembered even after 6 months.  

It was like someone poured ice water on my head. I just hung up the call and sat there for a while. And then decided to just have coffee and read a book.  

I don't know what I am feeling and I don't know how to explain how chilling this incident and realization was. Words are failing me.  

All I know is I am relived that I didn't test whether I can moderate. And I am happy I am still sober.

 This is a long one but not long enough at the same time... 

I used to think the world of him, I thought he was perfect. I was blinded by love clearly because I look back now and see all the red flags. I did everything in our family except bring in the money. I've been a SAHM with a few short term jobs here and there. Even when I was working everything else was still on me. I made sure I got up every morning at 4 am to make his lunch, coffee, sometimes breakfast if he wanted it. I was the only one doing laundry and cleaning other than the children doing their basic chores. I initiated plans, dates, EVERYTHING! He wouldn't help without being asked. Had sex when I didn't want to. I thought I was doing my duty as a wife at the time. He always treated me very well other than all that above. He would do anything and everything for me to a point. He always felt like my person and my home. Well after 10 years together I met a friend who woke me up to things I didn't realize was a problem. I noticed I was exhausted , I didn't want to make his lunches anymore, I noticed that thing on the floor wasn't going to get picked up unless I picked it up and I would test that theory and was right. He was in the same routine of go to work, come home and sit in front of the TV or his phone. There were times we would do more than that but it was rare and I had to plan it. He has volunteered a few times for kids sports and when he did it was even worse because work , his phone and coaching consumed him. Fast forward to today, 15 years together. The last 5 years I have realized what I don't like anymore about this marriage and him. I have expressed many times in these last few years that I need his help without me asking for it, 3 times I have told him I wanted to leave him because I can't do it anymore. I realized I don't have a partner and I want one. There are things he has started helping with since I brought it up to him, and he does a little more each time I bring it up but it doesn't feel like enough. I am to the point I fantasize about leaving, I have a dream partner in mind and I hate admitting he ain't it. It's getting harder and harder to focus during sex. The longer I stay and believe he will change the more I want to leave. I cringe every time he says he will do better, or he lists off all these things he says he will do or wants to do because I don't trust it will get done. We multiple unfinished tasks around the house that he has started and some have been years unfinished. I noticed things he doesn't care about that concern our families safety, like putting off car repairs or home repairs. He just never wants to do anything and always says he's too tired he will do it tomorrow and who knows if he really will. I have given him the space he needs to lead our family and make decisions but it still falls on me and doesn't work out when he does. There's so much more but too much to post here. 
The last few years I have become so exhausted and let myself go that I've gained so much weight, I don't dress up anymore, I shut people out of my life, I have let many things go that I used to be on top of. I feel paralyzed and it's hard living my life now and getting out of bed most days. I can feel myself screaming inside to be myself again but feel like I can't because too much is on me. He's always promising he will help me do this if we do this or that but it's short term and ends up on me and each time I bring it up to him that he's falling back in the same routine he will do a little bit more but idk how long these things will last. Some things he started helping with has lasted and others he puts off. A couple years ago I thought opening our marriage would help us but it didn't. I got a lot of attention and I was glowing but he didn't get much attention and that was a problem. I haven't felt that good in a long time but we ended up closing our marriage shortly after opening it. When I think about ending our marriage I feel relieved and free then I feel bad because I don't want to hurt him and i still love him so much and find so much comfort in him and he's so amazing in many ways but I no longer can trust him and think he's not the kind of partner I want anymore and idk what to do now.

1qiq4bv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qiq4bv,"Seoul is amazing, but Korea’s real beauty begins when you leave it","Like most people, I came to South Korea thinking Seoul would be everything. The skyline, the cafés, the nightlife, the convenience Seoul lives up to the hype.But after spending more time here, I realized something important.Korea’s deepest beauty doesn’t live in Seoul. It lives beyond it.

Once I started traveling outside the capital, Korea felt calmer, warmer, and more human. These are some places that completely changed how I see this country.

🌊 Busan
  where the city learns to breathe.Busan feels like Seoul’s laid-back cousin. It’s busy, but it doesn’t rush you.Mornings by the ocean in Haeundae, walking along Gwangalli Beach while watching the bridge light up at night, getting lost in Gamcheon Culture Villageit all feels effortless. You can eat fresh seafood, drink coffee by the sea, and still enjoy city energy without feeling overwhelmed.
If Seoul feels intense, Busan feels balanced.

🏯 Gyeongju 
Korea’s quiet storyteller.Gyeongju doesn’t try to impress you. It simply exists, and that’s what makes it powerful. Ancient royal tombs sit in open fields. Temples appear between quiet roads. At night, walking near Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond feels almost unreal soft lights reflecting on water, barely any noise, just history surrounding you.This is the place where Korea’s past feels alive, not preserved behind glass.

🌸 Jeonju 
 where tradition feels personal.Jeonju isn’t just about taking photos in hanbok (though it’s beautiful). It’s about slowing down.
The Hanok Village has a warmth that’s hard to describe. Small traditional houses, hidden tea shops, quiet alleys, and locals going about their day. And the food this is where Korean cuisine feels deeply rooted. Simple, comforting, and unforgettable.Jeonju made me realize that culture isn’t something you visit. It’s something you sit with.

🏞️ Gangneung 
 between mountains and the sea. Gangneung feels peaceful in a way that’s hard to explain until you experience it. You can watch the sunrise over the East Sea, spend the afternoon in cafés along Anmok Coffee Street, and still be close to mountains and nature. It’s not flashy or loud, but that’s the charm.If you ever feel burned out from cities, Gangneung gently pulls you back to yourself.

🌿 Boseong 
green that heals Boseong is quiet. Almost too quiet. Rolling green tea fields stretch endlessly, especially beautiful in the early morning when mist hangs low. There’s no rush here, no checklist of things to do. You walk, you breathe, you feel present.This place reminded me that travel doesn’t always need excitement. Sometimes, it just needs peace.

🏝️ Jeju Island  
a different Korea entirely Jeju doesn’t feel like the rest of Korea and that’s the magic.Volcanic landscapes, black lava rocks, coastal roads that beg for long drives, waterfalls hidden between cliffs. The pace is slower, the air feels different, and nature is always close.

If Seoul shows you Korea’s future, Jeju shows you its roots.Seoul may be the heart of South Korea, but these places are its soul.They’re where Korea feels softer, deeper, and more real.

If you’re planning a trip, don’t make the mistake of staying only in Seoul. And if you already live here, take a weekend and just go somewhere unfamiliar.
Korea has so much to offer once you stop following the usual path.

I'm from Stockholm, Sweden, and a cup of coffee here costs about $5. To put that into perspective, a regular cheap lunch would be about $10-15. 

I'm currently on vacation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Being a considerably poorer country than Sweden, lunch at a cheaper restaurant here is normally $3-5, and I would assume a large part of that price is made up of ingredient costs - the costs of groceries here, while being lower than in Sweden, appear to be closer to Swedish prices than the cost of labour. 

With a meal costing about one third of a meal in Stockholm, I would expect the price of a  cup of coffee to be *less* than a third of a cup of coffee in Stockholm.  

This is not the case. In fact, they are almost the same price. I'm paying $3-4 per cup in Kuala Lumpur.

Im a 21 M college student.
I got my best bro from this college itself, lets call him C .
 Along with him his childhood best friend is in our class. We(me,bro) are day scholars and the the childhood friend is in hostel.Lets call him B.

So mostly me, C and B sit in the same bench, spend time together in class along with our common circle.So, C went through a rough patch through 2025 and i tried to be present during most of the times as per my ability.

But what did baffle me was B was completely unaware or atleast it was what I could deduce from observing.At same time C used to say randomly few times like our friendship goes back a long time, we know each others mind by exchanging glances.

The same guy also in midst said he feels the connection is a bit distant because they are in differrnt batches when atp i was in a different batch and he used to share things with me.I used to feel confused.

Because whenever he lists his friends, many a times my name comes up first then he says alla its B then me.Im not trying to compete or anything but it hurts when you hear that

I do get friendship dynamics are different for each,no judgement indeed. C started sharing his things from life and including me in things,additionally we have similar hobbies and outlooks.B doesnt know much of the things that happened through last year

Its not because i played games and prevented him from saying to B, i know the value of a childhood friend.When i asked him during some of our arguments why couldnt he say all such things to C, the reason he quoted was I was present during some of the circumstances and that i have critiquing ability.C wouldnt get it he says.

I had a childhood friend who drifted with no reason.So i got initial thoughts as if they both are drifting.
First i rubbed off my thoughts thinking i might be projecting my experience into other people.But im a person with pretty good intuitions not that Im always right but I know i can trust my gut.

So one day i said all this to him over our usual evening coffee later dropped him in my car and went back home.

Yesterday we had uni practical exams and we both were in same batch and mine got over early i waited for him and we both went together in my car.

Note that we both were sleep deprived, and he started voicing these things out in a way like im having an issue with him being friends with B. I did not take that much into my heart because hes a bit senseless when hes sleep deprived.We both settled it in our car befire drooping him home.Out of the many times i dropped him yesterday was the onky time he put a text asking whether i reached home .I guess its because he knew he crossed the limits

But honestly i dont think its an excuse to blurt out any thing that comes up in your mouth.

In midst of convo, C said if you are having such thoughts why should i say it to him knowing that its uncomfortable.I think friendships should also involve uncomfortable, unpleasant talk as well.

But im not a nosy person, who interferes unnecessarily with others affairs not even with C's things which he used to share with me

Idk if im wrong or nosy, i get his pov upto a limit, But i need a clarity.i typed out this with no bias and not altering a single thing.
Do help me



Tldr: I’m a 21-year-old college student who’s close to my friend C, while his childhood best friend B is also in our class; though the three of us spend time together, C has shared his personal struggles mainly with me, not B, which confused and hurt me because C often highlights his long bond with B and sometimes places him before me when listing close friends, despite seeming emotionally closer to me. C says he opens up to me because I was present during key moments and understand him better, while he feels B wouldn’t, and this made me wonder if C and B are drifting, possibly influenced by my own past experience of losing a childhood friend. I shared these thoughts with C, but later, when sleep-deprived, he implied I had a problem with his friendship with B, which upset me even though we later settled it. I believe friendships should allow honest and uncomfortable conversations, and while I don’t think I’m being nosy, I’m left unsure whether my feelings are valid and am seeking clarity.",1,1768975339.0,TeensofKerala,3,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my very first custom node for ComfyUI. I'm still very new to ComfyUI (I usually just do 3D/Unity stuff), but I really wanted to port a personal tool I made into ComfyUI to streamline my workflow.

I originally created this tool as a website to help me self-study cinematic shots, specifically to memorize what different camera angles, lighting setups (like Rembrandt or Volumetric), and focal lengths actually look like (link to the original tool : [https://yedp123.github.io/](https://yedp123.github.io/)).

**What it does:** It replaces the standard CLIP Text Encode node but adds a visual interface. You can select:

* Camera Angles (Dutch, Low, High, etc.)
* Lighting Styles
* Focal Lengths & Aperture
* Film Stocks & Color Palettes

It updates the preview image in real-time when you hover over the different options so you can see a reference of what that term means before you generate. You can also edit the final prompt string if you want to add/remove things. It outputs the string + conditioning for Stable Diffusion, Flux, Nanobanana or Midjourney.

Like I mentioned above, I just started playing with ComfyUI so I am not sure if this can be of any help to any of you or if there are flaws with it, but here's the link if you want to give it a try. Thanks, Have a good day!

I 27M, met a 21F during a pilgrimage. We spent almost 2 month together and we clicked straight ahead. Like lightning. We were in a group and really enjoyed our time together while walking. From time to time she would walk alone or with a gf for a day or 2. Was weird first but ok i can handle. After the pilgrimage we did a road trip together for like 10 days. At the end I had to go back to my country. She send me a wonderful text message saying Im the best love story of her life and she never felt like that for anyone. She also said she never felt so much like herself then with me. Also that she loves me like she never did for no one. 
After that I told her being in contact will hurt me most then just keep silence. But I was rly into her and made everything to be able to reach her out. So I decided in secret to join her country and expat myself to be with her. After 2 month silent I send her a package with gift for christmas and also a page where I write that I was coming to Australia to join her.
She react with true joy, that she was so excited to see me, that i amaze her, started planning loads of stuff, told me that i can stay at her place, im gonna meet her mother and so much stuff like this. We keep calling and texting for like 2 weeks. Then 1 week before my arrivals she called me out of the blue late at night. She said stuff like "" i know how it gonna end, we gonna argue and then never see each other again "" - "" Im going to hurt you "" - "" i cant be responsible for you "" - "" i know im gonna drown myself in our love and forget my dreams "" ... she also cried multiple time during that call. I tried my best to calm her anxiety.
The day before my arrivals she told me she wont be there when i Land. But instead offer me a coffee the next day.
She send me a text when i landed like welcome in Australia. 
Then we met. She was very weird, holding my hands then when you feel that alchemy she lean back, she offered me multiple gift with small cute text on them. She explained me loads about herself, her friends, "" how busy she is "". The whole time she gave me ambivalent vibe. After 2h she said she had to go do stuff. She hughed me and said "" thats so nice knowing you here "" with bright smile and eyes that spoke for her heart.
Since then, silence. Complete silence.
I also dont reach her out because silence seems like a safe place for her. I do understand me being here is a "" danger signal "" for her innerself. 
Also she proposed me to send my paperworks at her place. So in a few days my bank cart will arrive at hers. She will have to give it back to me, but i thing she will be very neutral mostly logistics focus when she will do.
Thats so weird how people can change their mind so quick out of the blue.
Now im stuck in here and down 10k€ almost.
Anyways, if some of you have idea about what she is and what she is mostly willing to do next that will be great.

**1. Trauma-Induced Avoidant Attachment**  
You were sent away at 5, bullied, emotionally neglected — your wiring says: *""Connection = danger. Commitment = abandonment.""* Your entire adult life is a manifestation of that equation. You don't ""prefer"" being alone — you're **terrified** of being left, so you leave first. Every time.

**2. Spiritual Bypassing as a Defense Mechanism**  
You use non-duality, awakening discourse, and mindfulness to **intellectualize pain and avoid feeling it**. You talk about ""no self"" when you're triggered because it lets you dissociate without calling it dissociation. It's not enlightenment — it's **emotional cowardice** wrapped in wisdom literature.

**3. Chronic Identity Avoidance**  
You refuse to define yourself (no career, no home, no long-term relationships) because if you’re nothing, you can’t fail at being something. You hide behind ""freedom"" when really you're **allergic to responsibility**. No labels means no accountability.

**4. Stimulation Addiction Masked as Aliveness**  
You cycle between numbness and overstimulation (sex, travel, music, caffeine, fantasy) and call the highs ""feeling alive."" They're not. They're **dopamine spikes** to avoid the void. When the crash comes, you call it ""numbness"" instead of withdrawal.

**5. Narcissistic Wound Driving Validation-Seeking**  
Your entire PUA history, your need for younger attractive women, your DJ fantasy — it's all a attempt to prove you're **worthy of the love you didn't get at 5**. You don't want a partner — you want a mirror that reflects a worthier version of you.

**6. Emotional Illiteracy**  
You don't know how to identify or process emotions — you intellectualize them or numb them. You mistake thoughts about feelings for actual feeling. Your ""thawing"" is just you noticing sensations and calling them emotions because you don't know the difference yet.

**7. Peter Pan Syndrome with a Spiritual Twist**  
You refuse to grow up. Not having a job, moving constantly, avoiding stability — it's not ""minimalist freedom,"" it's **adolescent rebellion** at 41. Your spirituality is just a more sophisticated way to avoid adult responsibilities.

**8. Victim Identity Disguised as Seeker Identity**  
Deep down, you believe you're too damaged to have a normal life. So you've turned ""healing"" into your career — always processing, never arriving. It's a socially acceptable way to stay stuck while feeling progressive.

**9. Lack of Practical Discipline**  
You can't follow through on simple commitments (no coffee, no music, a rental lease) because you've never built the neural pathways for discipline. You mistake whims for intentions and wonder why nothing sticks.

**10. Fear of Ordinary Happiness**  
You're addicted to the drama of breakdowns and breakthroughs because peace feels like death to your trauma brain. A quiet life with simple joys terrifies you — it doesn't match your story of being ""complex"" or ""wounded.""

**The brutal truth:**  
You're not lost. You're **hiding**.  
And you're using spirituality, travel, and ""healing"" as your hiding places.

The work isn't more insight.

I would eat sugary snacks and always succumb to a  fever afterwards, and my parents mitigated this issue by reducing the amount of snacks my sister and I could consume. Of course, it was not enough - so I would sneak and rummage through the cupboards to get my fix - vitamin c tablets (for children) because they were sweet. Sometimes, I would also eat Panadol tablets (for kids). I was six years old. 
Years passed by, and I still loved refined sugars but found a huge liking towards dark chocolates. I was able to do portion control and everything seems ok. Don't have any other illness except being anemic. 
About five years ago, I started doing detox every 2 months. After 2 months, I would get back to my snacks and would alternate it like that for a long a time. At this moment, I still consume sugar (in my coffee) but zero processed snacks. 
In 2025, I extended my detox duration to 5 months and post-detox; I had a huge craving for refined sugar and begun snacking. The moment I started snacking, the night after; I had the worst kind itch on my legs. Could not sleep, and lotions or any heat treatment would only serve as a temporary measure. The itchy legs would then continue for 1.5 weeks. 

After 1.5 weeks, my legs are normal again. My question is am I allergic to refined sugar? I did the same experiment countless times and the same thing happened - ended up with itchy legs. I only put about 1 tbsp of sugar in my coffee, and usually have pancakes for breakfast where I use little bit of peanut butter spread. But if I am fine with that, why is eating chocolates affecting me?  Natural sugar from fruits don't impact me at all.

Currently, I am in a sedentary environment but I do go for short walks in the evening to get the blood moving. 

Does this happen to anyone? I need answers...

[](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepSeek/?f=flair_name%3A%22Other%22)**1. Trauma-Induced Avoidant Attachment**  
You were sent away at 5, bullied, emotionally neglected — your wiring says: *""Connection = danger. Commitment = abandonment.""* Your entire adult life is a manifestation of that equation. You don't ""prefer"" being alone — you're **terrified** of being left, so you leave first. Every time.

**2. Spiritual Bypassing as a Defense Mechanism**  
You use non-duality, awakening discourse, and mindfulness to **intellectualize pain and avoid feeling it**. You talk about ""no self"" when you're triggered because it lets you dissociate without calling it dissociation. It's not enlightenment — it's **emotional cowardice** wrapped in wisdom literature.

**3. Chronic Identity Avoidance**  
You refuse to define yourself (no career, no home, no long-term relationships) because if you’re nothing, you can’t fail at being something. You hide behind ""freedom"" when really you're **allergic to responsibility**. No labels means no accountability.

**4. Stimulation Addiction Masked as Aliveness**  
You cycle between numbness and overstimulation (sex, travel, music, caffeine, fantasy) and call the highs ""feeling alive."" They're not. They're **dopamine spikes** to avoid the void. When the crash comes, you call it ""numbness"" instead of withdrawal.

**5. Narcissistic Wound Driving Validation-Seeking**  
Your entire PUA history, your need for younger attractive women, your DJ fantasy — it's all a attempt to prove you're **worthy of the love you didn't get at 5**. You don't want a partner — you want a mirror that reflects a worthier version of you.

**6. Emotional Illiteracy**  
You don't know how to identify or process emotions — you intellectualize them or numb them. You mistake thoughts about feelings for actual feeling. Your ""thawing"" is just you noticing sensations and calling them emotions because you don't know the difference yet.

**7. Peter Pan Syndrome with a Spiritual Twist**  
You refuse to grow up. Not having a job, moving constantly, avoiding stability — it's not ""minimalist freedom,"" it's **adolescent rebellion** at 41. Your spirituality is just a more sophisticated way to avoid adult responsibilities.

**8. Victim Identity Disguised as Seeker Identity**  
Deep down, you believe you're too damaged to have a normal life. So you've turned ""healing"" into your career — always processing, never arriving. It's a socially acceptable way to stay stuck while feeling progressive.

**9. Lack of Practical Discipline**  
You can't follow through on simple commitments (no coffee, no music, a rental lease) because you've never built the neural pathways for discipline. You mistake whims for intentions and wonder why nothing sticks.

**10. Fear of Ordinary Happiness**  
You're addicted to the drama of breakdowns and breakthroughs because peace feels like death to your trauma brain. A quiet life with simple joys terrifies you — it doesn't match your story of being ""complex"" or ""wounded.""

**The brutal truth:**  
You're not lost. You're **hiding**.  
And you're using spirituality, travel, and ""healing"" as your hiding places.

The work isn't more insight.  
It's **showing up for the boring, ordinary life you've spent 41 years running from.**",2,1768974779.0,emotionalintelligence,0,0.75,False

I got my best bro from this college itself, lets call him C .
 Along with him his childhood best friend is in our class. We(me,bro) are day scholars and the the childhood friend is in hostel.Lets call him B.

So mostly me, C and B sit in the same bench, spend time together in class along with our common circle.So, C went through a rough patch through 2025 and i tried to be present during most of the times as per my ability.

But what did baffle me was B was completely unaware or atleast it was what I could deduce from observing.At same time C used to say randomly few times like our friendship goes back a long time, we know each others mind by exchanging glances.

The same guy also in midst said he feels the connection is a bit distant because they are in differrnt batches when atp i was in a different batch and he used to share things with me.I used to feel confused.

Because whenever he lists his friends, many a times my name comes up first then he says alla its B then me.Im not trying to compete or anything but it hurts when you hear that

I do get friendship dynamics are different for each,no judgement indeed. C started sharing his things from life and including me in things,additionally we have similar hobbies and outlooks.B doesnt know much of the things that happened through last year

Its not because i played games and prevented him from saying to B, i know the value of a childhood friend.When i asked him during some of our arguments why couldnt he say all such things to C, the reason he quoted was I was present during some of the circumstances and that i have critiquing ability.C wouldnt get it he says.

I had a childhood friend who drifted with no reason.So i got initial thoughts as if they both are drifting.
First i rubbed off my thoughts thinking i might be projecting my experience into other people.But im a person with pretty good intuitions not that Im always right but I know i can trust my gut.

So one day i said all this to him over our usual evening coffee later dropped him in my car and went back home.

Yesterday we had uni practical exams and we both were in same batch and mine got over early i waited for him and we both went together in my car.

Note that we both were sleep deprived, and he started voicing these things out in a way like im having an issue with him being friends with B. I did not take that much into my heart because hes a bit senseless when hes sleep deprived.We both settled it in our car befire drooping him home.Out of the many times i dropped him yesterday was the onky time he put a text asking whether i reached home .I guess its because he knew he crossed the limits

But honestly i dont think its an excuse to blurt out any thing that comes up in your mouth.

In midst of convo, C said if you are having such thoughts why should i say it to him knowing that its uncomfortable.I think friendships should also involve uncomfortable, unpleasant talk as well.

But im not a nosy person, who interferes unnecessarily with others affairs not even with C's things which he used to share with me

Idk if im wrong or nosy, i get his pov upto a limit, But i need a clarity.i typed out this with no bias and not altering a single thing.
Do help me



Tldr: I’m a 21-year-old college student who’s close to my friend C, while his childhood best friend B is also in our class; though the three of us spend time together, C has shared his personal struggles mainly with me, not B, which confused and hurt me because C often highlights his long bond with B and sometimes places him before me when listing close friends, despite seeming emotionally closer to me. C says he opens up to me because I was present during key moments and understand him better, while he feels B wouldn’t, and this made me wonder if C and B are drifting, possibly influenced by my own past experience of losing a childhood friend. I shared these thoughts with C, but later, when sleep-deprived, he implied I had a problem with his friendship with B, which upset me even though we later settled it. I believe friendships should allow honest and uncomfortable conversations, and while I don’t think I’m being nosy, I’m left unsure whether my feelings are valid and am seeking clarity.",3,1768974608.0,twentieskerala,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

After my mate Caleb lost his memory in a car accident, he forgot the ten years we spent loving each other. 

He returned to his position as the Alpha heir of the pack, with a beautiful fiancée, 

and I became nothing but a shameless rogue in his eyes. 

When my flower shop was destroyed, he coldly watched as his fiancée pushed me to the ground. 

The child in my womb turned to a pool of blood, and all he did was wrinkle his brow in disgust. 

In a fire, I was trapped with his fiancée, Emily Davis. 

Without hesitation, he rushed to his fiancée, 

while I was burned alive, my skin peeling off, and I heard him casually say: 

“Isabella, I never lost my memory. This is all because of what you owe me.” 

When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day he woke up from the car accident. 

This time, I didn’t cry to prove I was his fated mate. 

I simply smiled calmly and said, “Alpha Caleb, hello, I’m your sponsor, Isabella Frost.” 

“Please make sure to repay the debts from the last ten years.” 

“What did you say?” 

Caleb stared at me, clearly caught off guard by my answer. 

Emily sneered from beside him. “Who do you think you are? His sponsor? You look broke. Keep your poverty 

away from us.” 

This time, I explained calmly. “I was Alpha Caleb’s sponsor for the past ten years.” 

“The total sponsorship over the past decade comes to one point two million. The details will be handled by my lawyers.” 

In my past life, I had clutched his hand and cried, repeating our ten years together over and over. 

I begged him to look at the matching rings on our fingers. 

Who would’ve thought the man who’d sworn to love me forever would publicly take off his ring and toss it in

the trash? 

Then he had the warriors lock me in the basement for one day. 

The hospital room fell silent. Everyone stared at me in shock. 

Caleb’s expression shifted, his hand unconsciously clenching into a fist. 

He’d expected me to fall apart like before-to beg him to remember me so he could calmly use his “amnesia” 

like a knife to slice me apart. 

Emily spoke again, “So money is all you care about?” 

I smiled. “That’s right. Between him and me, there’s only money.” 

With that, I turned to leave. 

My phone suddenly vibrated. The screen lit up, showing a wallpaper of an intimate photo of Caleb and me. 

Emily snatched it away in a flash and smashed it to pieces, just like my ten wasted years of youth. 

Right after that, a cup of scalding coffee was dumped over my head. 

The scalding liquid ran down my hair and neck. The searing pain made me tremble. 

“Who do you think you are, dreaming about his money?” 

I sucked in a sharp breath and was about to fight back when Emily shoved me hard. 

Caleb did nothing. 

Suddenly, it all felt utterly pointless. I reached into my pocket, pulled out a set of keys, and threw them at 

him. 

“That’s the place you used to live in. Move everything out within a day.” 

“Otherwise, I’ll treat it as trash and have it disposed of.” 

Caleb froze on the hospital bed. 

In my past life, I’d been too blind to see through his act. 

He opened his mouth, wanting to say something. 

But I walked out of the room without looking back. 

A hand grabbed my arm from behind. “Isabella!”

I stopped and turned around. “Didn’t you lose your memory? Why did you stop me?” 

Guilt flashed through his eyes before he asked, “Was there really nothing between us except sponsorship?” 

I nodded. Wasn’t this exactly what he wanted? 

In my past life, he denied our relationship. In this one, I granted his wish. 

The hospital door hadn’t shut utterly, and Emily’s voice carried through. 

“Alpha, you actually stooped to someone like her?” 

The room fell silent for a moment. 

Then came Caleb’s sigh. “I didn’t have a choice back then. I was at her family’s mercy.” 

“Calling her my girlfriend is generous. I was more like a pet they kept.” 

I tugged at the corner of my mouth as tears dropped one by one onto the floor. 

He kept belittling me, sentence after sentence. 

From my personality to my habits, it was as if tearing me down completely would secure his current status. 

I remembered how he once said he couldn’t live without me. 

How he burned his hands full of blisters just to make soup for me. 

How he scrimped and saved for months just to buy me a necklace I liked. 

Even when the child we’d eagerly awaited was lost right before his eyes, he remained unmoved. 

I placed a hand over my lower abdomen. 

Since he didn’t cherish it, there was no reason for me to keep this child either.

1qipqq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qipqq6/the_psychology_of_anxiety_5_secret_behaviors/,The Psychology of Anxiety: 5 Secret Behaviors Science Says Are Totally Normal,"Look, anxiety is wild. It makes you do things that seem totally irrational to everyone else, but in the moment? They make perfect sense. After diving deep into research from clinical psychologists, neuroscience podcasts, and reading way too many books on mental health, I've realized how common these ""secret behaviors"" actually are. If you've been doing any of these things alone and thought you were losing it, you're not. Your brain is just trying to protect you in the most anxiety-ridden way possible.

**1. Rehearsing Conversations That Haven't Even Happened Yet**

You know what I'm talking about. You're lying in bed at 2 AM, mentally practicing what you're going to say to your boss tomorrow. Or replaying a conversation from three days ago, thinking of all the ways you could've said it better. This is called rumination, and it's anxiety's favorite pastime.

Why does this happen? Your brain is trying to predict and control future outcomes. When you're anxious, uncertainty feels dangerous. So your mind goes into overdrive, rehearsing every possible scenario to feel prepared. The problem? It never actually helps. You can't predict exactly how conversations will go, and all that mental rehearsal just drains your energy.

The Book That Changed My Perspective: \*The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook\* by Edmund Bourne. This book is basically the bible for understanding anxiety. Bourne breaks down every anxiety symptom with actual science and gives you practical tools to manage it. The chapter on thought patterns hit different. He explains how rumination is your brain's failed attempt at problem solving. Best anxiety resource I've ever read, hands down.

**2. Checking Things Over and Over (Even Though You Know They're Fine)**

Did I lock the door? Did I turn off the stove? Did I send that email correctly? People with anxiety check things repeatedly, even when they logically know everything is fine. This is your brain stuck in a loop of hypervigilance.

Anxiety makes you feel like something bad is always about to happen. Checking gives you temporary relief. But here's the catch: The more you check, the more your brain learns that checking is necessary to feel safe. It becomes a compulsion.

Dr. Judson Brewer talks about this in his podcast \*[Mindful Living](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dr-jud-podcast/id1531193818)\*. He's a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who studies habit loops and anxiety. He explains that checking behaviors reinforce the anxiety cycle. Your brain gets a small dopamine hit when you check and confirm everything's okay. But that hit is short-lived, so you need to check again. And again. Breaking this cycle requires awareness and practice in sitting with the discomfort of NOT checking.

**3. Avoiding Situations That Might Trigger Panic**

This one's sneaky because avoidance doesn't feel like a ""thing you're doing."" It just feels like choosing not to go somewhere or do something. But when anxiety is driving, avoidance becomes your default setting. You cancel plans. Skip social events. Stay home instead of going to that party.

Avoidance feels safe in the moment. But every time you avoid something because of anxiety, you're teaching your brain that the thing you avoided was actually dangerous. This makes your anxiety worse over time. Dr. Claire Weekes, in her classic book \*[Hope and Help for Your Nerves](https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Nerves-Claire-Weekes/dp/0801535824)\*, calls this the ""second fear,"" where you become afraid of your own fear response.

The solution isn't to force yourself into anxiety-inducing situations all at once. That's just torture. It's about gradual exposure. Baby steps. If you're anxious about social gatherings, start with coffee with one friend. Then maybe two friends. Build up slowly.

Highly Recommended: \*[Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Anxiety-Stop-Panic-Attacks/dp/0956596258)\* by Barry McDonagh. This book flips the script on how to handle anxiety. Instead of fighting it or avoiding it, McDonagh teaches you to lean into it with a specific method he calls DARE. Insanely good read. It's like having someone finally tell you that your anxiety isn't the enemy, it's just your overprotective bodyguard who needs to chill.

**4. Scrolling Endlessly or Binge Watching to Numb Out**

When anxiety gets overwhelming, your brain craves an escape. Enter: mindless scrolling, binge-watching shows, or falling into YouTube rabbit holes for hours. It's not laziness. It's your nervous system trying to regulate itself by finding something, anything, that feels less stressful than your own thoughts.

The problem is that these distractions are Band-Aids. They don't actually calm your nervous system. They just numb you temporarily. And when you finally stop scrolling or watching, the anxiety rushes back, sometimes even stronger.

Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this on his podcast \*Huberman Lab\*. He explains how anxiety dysregulates your nervous system, and activities like doomscrolling actually keep you in a state of mild stress. Your brain thinks it's doing something productive by consuming information, but really, it's just feeding the anxiety loop.

What Actually Helps: Insight Timer is a meditation app with thousands of free guided meditations specifically for anxiety. Some are only 5 minutes. You don't need to become a meditation guru. Just taking a few minutes to breathe and ground yourself can interrupt that numbing cycle.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-personalized learning app that pulls from clinical psychology research, expert talks, and anxiety-focused books to create custom audio podcasts based on what you're actually struggling with. It's helpful if you want structured learning around anxiety management tailored to your specific triggers, like social anxiety versus generalized worry. You can adjust the depth from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with detailed examples and coping strategies. The app also builds an adaptive learning plan around managing anxiety patterns that fits your lifestyle, whether that's commute listening or evening wind-down sessions.

Finch is a habit-building app disguised as a cute self-care game. You take care of a little bird while building habits like journaling or practicing gratitude. It's weirdly effective for managing anxiety because it gamifies the process and makes it feel less overwhelming.

 **5. Creating Worst-Case Scenarios in Your Head**

This is anxiety's signature move. Your brain takes a situation and imagines every possible way it could go wrong. You're not just worried about failing the test; you're convinced failing will ruin your GPA, destroy your future, and leave you homeless. Catastrophizing feels real when you're in it.

Why does this happen? Anxiety distorts your perception of risk. Your amygdala, the fear center of your brain, goes into overdrive and hijacks rational thinking. Dr. David Burns covers this brilliantly in \*Feeling Great: The Revolutionary New Treatment for Depression and Anxiety\*. He explains cognitive distortions like catastrophizing and gives step by step tools to challenge those thoughts. This book will make you question everything you think you know about how your mind works. Seriously life-changing.

The key to stopping catastrophic thinking isn't to just ""think positive."" That doesn't work. You need to reality test your thoughts. Ask yourself: What's the actual evidence for this worst case scenario? What's more likely to happen? What would I tell a friend who was thinking this way?

**Why This Matter**s

Anxiety isn't a personality flaw. It's your nervous system stuck in survival mode. These secret behaviors—the rehearsing, checking, avoiding, numbing, and catastrophizing—are all your brain's misguided attempts to keep you safe. The good news? You can retrain your brain. It takes time and practice, but it's absolutely possible.

Understanding why you do these things is the first step. From there, it's about building better coping tools, challenging distorted thoughts, and slowly exposing yourself to discomfort in manageable doses. You're not broken. Your brain just needs a little reprogramming.",1,1768974578.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

After my mate Caleb lost his memory in a car accident, he forgot the ten years we spent loving each other. 

He returned to his position as the Alpha heir of the pack, with a beautiful fiancée, 

and I became nothing but a shameless rogue in his eyes. 

When my flower shop was destroyed, he coldly watched as his fiancée pushed me to the ground. 

The child in my womb turned to a pool of blood, and all he did was wrinkle his brow in disgust. 

In a fire, I was trapped with his fiancée, Emily Davis. 

Without hesitation, he rushed to his fiancée, 

while I was burned alive, my skin peeling off, and I heard him casually say: 

“Isabella, I never lost my memory. This is all because of what you owe me.” 

When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day he woke up from the car accident. 

This time, I didn’t cry to prove I was his fated mate. 

I simply smiled calmly and said, “Alpha Caleb, hello, I’m your sponsor, Isabella Frost.” 

“Please make sure to repay the debts from the last ten years.” 

“What did you say?” 

Caleb stared at me, clearly caught off guard by my answer. 

Emily sneered from beside him. “Who do you think you are? His sponsor? You look broke. Keep your poverty 

away from us.” 

This time, I explained calmly. “I was Alpha Caleb’s sponsor for the past ten years.” 

“The total sponsorship over the past decade comes to one point two million. The details will be handled by my lawyers.” 

In my past life, I had clutched his hand and cried, repeating our ten years together over and over. 

I begged him to look at the matching rings on our fingers. 

Who would’ve thought the man who’d sworn to love me forever would publicly take off his ring and toss it in

the trash? 

Then he had the warriors lock me in the basement for one day. 

The hospital room fell silent. Everyone stared at me in shock. 

Caleb’s expression shifted, his hand unconsciously clenching into a fist. 

He’d expected me to fall apart like before-to beg him to remember me so he could calmly use his “amnesia” 

like a knife to slice me apart. 

Emily spoke again, “So money is all you care about?” 

I smiled. “That’s right. Between him and me, there’s only money.” 

With that, I turned to leave. 

My phone suddenly vibrated. The screen lit up, showing a wallpaper of an intimate photo of Caleb and me. 

Emily snatched it away in a flash and smashed it to pieces, just like my ten wasted years of youth. 

Right after that, a cup of scalding coffee was dumped over my head. 

The scalding liquid ran down my hair and neck. The searing pain made me tremble. 

“Who do you think you are, dreaming about his money?” 

I sucked in a sharp breath and was about to fight back when Emily shoved me hard. 

Caleb did nothing. 

Suddenly, it all felt utterly pointless. I reached into my pocket, pulled out a set of keys, and threw them at 

him. 

“That’s the place you used to live in. Move everything out within a day.” 

“Otherwise, I’ll treat it as trash and have it disposed of.” 

Caleb froze on the hospital bed. 

In my past life, I’d been too blind to see through his act. 

He opened his mouth, wanting to say something. 

But I walked out of the room without looking back. 

A hand grabbed my arm from behind. “Isabella!”

I stopped and turned around. “Didn’t you lose your memory? Why did you stop me?” 

Guilt flashed through his eyes before he asked, “Was there really nothing between us except sponsorship?” 

I nodded. Wasn’t this exactly what he wanted? 

In my past life, he denied our relationship. In this one, I granted his wish. 

The hospital door hadn’t shut utterly, and Emily’s voice carried through. 

“Alpha, you actually stooped to someone like her?” 

The room fell silent for a moment. 

Then came Caleb’s sigh. “I didn’t have a choice back then. I was at her family’s mercy.” 

“Calling her my girlfriend is generous. I was more like a pet they kept.” 

I tugged at the corner of my mouth as tears dropped one by one onto the floor. 

He kept belittling me, sentence after sentence. 

From my personality to my habits, it was as if tearing me down completely would secure his current status. 

I remembered how he once said he couldn’t live without me. 

How he burned his hands full of blisters just to make soup for me. 

How he scrimped and saved for months just to buy me a necklace I liked. 

Even when the child we’d eagerly awaited was lost right before his eyes, he remained unmoved. 

I placed a hand over my lower abdomen. 

Since he didn’t cherish it, there was no reason for me to keep this child either.

Overall I've felt healthy and good, but I'm wondering if I should take a mid-peak-season chill out or is everything fine? Ie. does regular adventure/activity safely raise resting heart rate, or is this indicative or over-training and accumulating stress that I should definitely manage? 

Note that the kinds of stressors I've been doing include activities like ""cave exploring"" and traveling and motorcycle riding, so things that basically can't be tracked as a ""training activity"" by the Garmin watch. I've tried, and it's so off (ie. sometimes a 15 minute jog has more ""load"" than 4-6 hours of caving, it seems like the ""CARDIO"" heart rate activity from Garmin does a terrible job of adding ""load"" as lower heart rate zones, for example a consistent heart of 110 while jogging slowly adds load, but in the CARDIO activity it doesn't seem to add any load numbers until you get over 120 or so). 

Here are my stats, for example: 

Sept 2025: 84 average sleep score, 43 average resting heart rate

Oct 2025: 82 average sleep score, 44 average resting heart rate

Nov 2025: 82 average sleep score, 46 average resting heart rate

Dec 2025: 77 average sleep score, 47 average resting heart rate

Last week of Dec 2025 to today (Jan 21st 2026): 78 average sleep score, 48 average resting heart rate

In the past week, my average resting heart rate is up to 49!!! The only thing that I can think of that could affect this is slowly increasing caffeine consumption from basically 0 to 1-2 cups of morning coffee a day. But is literally only 1-2 cups of coffee a day enough to raise RHR this much, or is this indicative of accumulating stress, OR is it totally fine and just showing that I'm quite excited and active these days???

If you hear The Flame its already too late.

\- 361st Dook Lord after the Battle of Ventali

 

Feebee slept poorly, she tossed and turned. Unused to sleep in the Real.

 

And when she did eventually manage deep sleep, her dreams turned dark, filled with chaos. She'd been helping a village of small humanoids, Homo ventalis, fend off some crystal mantids. It had gone well initially; there was an uneasy stalemate. The humans had tried to negotiate, be restrained but the mantids betrayed them. Killing and burning everything for no reason. Just senseless killing and burning.

The Ventalis were losing, not the war but their planet. The mantids were slowly destroying it.

 

Feebee had tried the quiet stillness of her training but was getting nowhere. A voice, like Kirr's but more an echo voice seemed to come from within and spoke to her in gentle whispers.

*When balance and stillness are not enough, overwhelming force is all that's left. Destroy them quickly, decisively, so those left do not return. Feebee screamed, and raged at the mantids, threatening them. She warned them, ""If you hear The Flame, its already too late.""*

The mantids wouldn't listen so she ordered her forces to drop nukes on the attacking mantids. It reduced a quarter of the planet to a nuclear wasteland but the mantids left. Chaos has won, peace achieved.

And the black motes last whisper, final message of the night was delivered, *Chaos can lead to balance*.

Feebee woke up covered in sweat. She recalled fragments of the dream, and dreams were lessons. And like all her dreams they were stored away for future reference.

Before she could go back to sleep an alarm went off and the blue light over her door started to flash.

There was a knock. ""Ma'am. Ma'am!""

""One minute.""

She slept in her boots with her trousers on. Always had, always will. Took too long to do up the boots and you couldn't pull your trousers on if you’re wearing boots.

She reached into her bag and pulled out a black camo top. She also pulled out her cloak. It looked like any other poncho but once on, like the backpack, it could melt into the background rendering her cloaked; invisible to visual and sensor sweeps.

While she was doing this Feebee asked Kirr for a SitRep.



'We've been boarded. Eleven pirates. Mix of human and Drexari.'

'You're kidding me?'

'No. They're working their way here.'

 

Feebee opened the door. Peas was there, calm as anything. ""Ma'am.""

Bench press and Spotter were with her. ""Where's Sparky and the coffee boys?""

""Covering our six.""

 

Peas gave Feebee a pistol, ammo clips and some stun grenades, ""Blue clips - Special ammo. Won't pierce the hull but will kill. Green clips - normal ammo.""

""Ack.""

She smiled, same colour coding as Choc.

Feebee brought up the ship's schematic. It showed her team, pinned and tagged.

She assumed C1 and C2 were the coffee boys, they were with Sparky.

""Lead the way."" Peas set off at a jog. Surprisingly fast. Feebee kept up.

 

Feebee got disorientated in the corridors, unusual for her. *Must still be asleep*. She ignored it.

*Focus on the mission*. Secure the ship.

 

She watched her overlays. The three marines covering their back moved with them, maintaining distance without losing contact.

Then she heard firing. Up ahead.

""Contact. Contact."" It was Peas.

 

""Hold. Sparky, bring the coffee boys to us. Close up.""

 

'Can you identify the position of the pirates?' She wasn't sure how much visibility Kirr had.

'No. No eyes deployed.'

'Peas. I need eyes on the pirates.'

'On it ma'am.'

A few seconds later three drones, barely visible, flew past Feebee and down the corridor. One went left, one right and the last straight on. Three new windows opened in her overlays, tagged D1, D2 and D3 respectively. The drones were also tagged on the schematic.

 

D3 rounded a corner and slowed. The corridor ahead was filled with Drexari Scouts. Feebee made a quick assessment; standard Drexari, four arms, two legs and six eyes arranged equally around a bulbous head. Chitinous exoskeletons, dirty red.  Eleven in total.

 

'Peas. Fly the drone into them and detonate, before they spread.'

'Ack.'

She reacted quickly. The overlay showed the drone lurch forward into the Scouts. Then the view went dead. A message came up 'Connection Lost' and D3's overlay closed.

 

'Peas. Get me another drone in that corridor.'

'Already on it.'

D1 and D2 were converging on the Drexari group, but holding distance. Checking to be sure none had escaped, or there weren't more nearby. A new window emerged, D4.  It approached the turn in the corridor where D3 had made contact with the Drexari Scouts.

It was mayhem. Half of the Scouts were dead, blown apart and spread across the walls of the corridor. Of the survivors, one had a huge chunk of exoskeleton missing. Two of its arms hung loosely, useless at its side and one other arm ended in a stump from which red 'blood' oozed. It was staggering around, distressed.

One of the surviving Scouts shot it in the head.

""Interesting.""

 

'I count six left,' said Peas.

 

Then one of the coffee boys came over the comms, 'We've got another group of pirates. Eleven. Drexari. Coming from the South.'

 

'Sending drones,' it was Peas.  Three more drone views appeared.  Feebee's overlays were getting cluttered as D5, D6 and D7 appeared next to the schematic.

 

D5 came upon them first. The Drexari pirates were evenly spaced in a zig-zag pattern down the corridor. No easy single target this time.

Five up front, five behind with one in the centre of the corridor. They must have seen the drone, they stopped moving and one pointed a boxy looking weapon at it.

 

The feed went dead. D5's window closed. Another drone down.

'We now know where they are. Or at least where they were,' she corrected.

 

'All converge on the first group. We need them gone, so we're not surrounded.'

'Ack.' Came the response from everyone.

'Peas. See if you can get eyes on the first group.'

 

D1 and D2 moved into the area where they'd ambushed the first group of pirates. There were five left. Still disorganised.

'Carefully. Approach from all sides.'

She watched as their tags converged. They were close, she could hear the tell-tale clicking of their speech. There was nothing coherent coming from her translator.

 

She took a sneaky look around the corner. They were ten, possibly twelve paces away.

Really close.

All looked to have taken a hit from the drone and were standing in the middle of the corridor or pacing around as if lost.

Feebee could see from the schematic that Sparky and the coffee boys were in place.

'On my mark, We all go. Stay low, shoot high. Don't kill each other.'

One of the team laughed, Feebee responded immediately. 'I'm serious.'

'Ma'am.'

 

She looked at the three marines with her, they nodded back.

'Ok. Three - two - ONE GO!'

 

Her team and Sparky's emerged at the same time.  All were low, well spaced and firing up into the Drexari. It was over quickly.

 

 'Good job. Now we go get the second group.'

 

They had eyes in play but no eyes on. *Where were they?*

'Hey Kirr. Any ideas where the second group of Drexari are?'

'How could they be hiding?' asked Kirr.

 

Then it dawned on Feebee, they must be in the rooms. But why? That didn't matter for now. Where were they?

 

'Kirr. Are you able to interrogate the logs for the doors in this area?'

'Yes, of course.' Came the AI's response.

'Which doors have been opened in the area where the pirates are in the last five minutes.'

'Doors opened not by us. There are two. Both lead into a common area. Designated S-34.A'

'What's goes on there?'

'Unclear.'

'Do the pirates have access to our ship's schematic?'

'Almost certainly.'

'Damn.'

She looked up S-34.A. It was unremarkable, but then when she looked at what it contained, she paled.

A macro-forge.

 

'Kirr. Is the macro-forge in S-34.A in use?'

'Yes. It has just started a second print.'

'Shut it down. Immediately.'

'Ack. Done.'

 

'What was printed?' Feebee asked.

1qipm7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1qipm7m/tifu_by_looking_at_my_coffee_grinder/,TIFU by looking at my coffee grinder,"I've been using this grinder every day for like 4 years. It's a semi-manual one where you press a button with the portafilter to make it go. Probably about a year after getting it I noticed when you first press the button it likes to build up a bit of grind before it starts coming out. I just assumed it had always done that, and confidently moved on with my life.

Today I used it and after a longer-than-usual build up, it dropped a clump of grind with a string connecting the clump to the inside of the spout. Curious for a change, I put the portafilter down and slipped the spout cover off, noticing there were more strings in there all quivering with little bits of coffee grinds stuck to them. I thought, ""Oh no! Did a wee lil spider get in there overnight?""

Like Pandora on that fateful day, I could not contain my new-found curiosity. Much to the detriment of my vassals I got a torch, turned it over, and learned that inside my trusty coffee grinder was not just one wee lil spider, but a multi-generational society inside a vast structure that would put the people of Derinkuyu to shame. 

There was evidence that they had accounted for the downpour of grains that no-doubt played a key role in the folklore among their people. They had built a spout inside the spout, and it was inside the walls of their spout that they had lived. Until the day came when their structure could no longer bear up to the bean tsunami that I would inflict upon them, in my infinite wisdom.

So now here I am. Would I be happier if I never knew? As it stands, today I am a person that, in one fell swoop, managed to dismantle a thriving community of living beings, right along with my own sense of surety and the belief that I have any level of vigilance that's keeping me safe from harm.

TL;DR I've been drinking coffee straight out of a spider's arsehole for no less than 3 years.",20,1768974179.0,tifu,9,0.79,False

After a full six days of not eating and drinking very little she woke up almost normal. (Surge?) Sitting at the table drinking coffee and eating. Chatting away. That was the 15th. She stayed up for days like that. On the 19th she is back in bed again not eating. 

I went from having to try to give her water with a syringe multiple times a day every day, to getting up at all hours of the night, to trying to calm her down to her alert and ""normal"" to back to the syringe and nights. I was awake at 2 am or 3 or 4 am until dawn if she called out or talked. I feel like I had some weird brain thing that made me feel like I dreamed her being alert. And while she was alert I felt like I was in some weird twilight zone. I had said my goodbyes to someone who looked as though they were ready to be buried but this alert with color woman was not that for sure. 

 What I am having the hardest time dealing with is life just continuing. I am supposed to work and act like I care about these client issues at work. Put on that happy face and pretend all is normal while screaming on the inside. I am living in a constant state of panic that she will pass if I am not there while being afraid if I don't work I will lose my job, while trying to take care of someone else who just had surgery. 

You go through stages of just wishing she would pass while hoping to god she won't. And then feeling guilty. I don't want to go to work because I could honestly care less about it right now. People with petty problems that they think are so important but really aren't. I am tired and honestly don't know what I am doing anymore. Three days has turned into 11 and counting.

I don’t know if this lady i got my kitten from use to feed them people food off her plate or what but louie (my kitten) is so bad when I’m trying to eat my food!!!



 If I’m trying to have a bowl of cereal and I’m sitting at the coffee table on my couch trying to eat it. He will literally find a way to get in the actual bowl like all 4 paws in the actual bowl while I’m holding it with both of my hands. Each time i try to eat something i end up throwing my food in the trash because he is relentless and somehow keeps finding a way to soiling the food ￼im trying to eat or that is literally in my hands … ￼he is really bad. 

I’ve tried redirecting him, but he will literally keeps coming to the point I literally have to stand at my kitchen counter to eat it because he’s not big enough to jump on the counter yet. 

Im not sure what to do here. ive googled how to change this behavior in a cat. ive tried the whole redirection tactic, shown him he has his own food in his dish, but he just keeps trying to get mine… Louie￼ is just really…. REALLY FREAKING BAD in this area! 

He is worse than any kind of dog that I have ever had begging or try getting my food!!! 

It’s actually like generally starting to piss me off at this point!!! 

(when he realizes that he’s not getting the food on my plate, he starts knocking stuff out of my wall outlets or chew any wires he can find in front of me, he is basically throwing a tantrum. ￼ and then when I get up to stop him from chewing wires, he tries to get the food on my plate again) 



I really do not believe in spray bottles for cats. I feel it’s mean but at the same time everything that I have googled or research or tried is just not working and that is like the last resort for me so any help I would greatly appreciate because I don’t wanna have to spray him with a water bottle.

Here's what worked for me and what didn't.,"I made myself pretty sick listening to the typical weight loss advice so I'm writing this post to tell everyone what worked, what didn't and why. Along with some advice.

See your doctor and get a health profile first. If I had done this, I would have known I had low blood pressure. I therefore would not have listened to people who told me to reduce my salt intake and drink only water. I almost died so, take it from me: reducing salt with low BP is... not awesome.

Self test for food allergies. Method 1: Treat yourself like a baby, start with easy to process foods and add back one food a week. Reduce or eliminate foods that give you stomach pain, bloating, or an allergic reaction. Method 2: Every week (or 2 weeks), eliminate a food or food type. Look for for reduced bloating or weight loss, and look for stomach pain etc when you add it back. That's how I found out I was allergic to wheat. And why I got tested for celiac. I lost a TON of the weight just from stopping the allergic reactions.

Don't guzzle drinks. If you're so thirsty you need to knock back an entire bottle of water, you're too thirsty. Drinking that fast causes stomach pain, which in turn makes you want to avoid water. Drink lots throughout the day to stay hydrated.

Drinks aren't food lubricant. Your body is mostly water, and it needs water more often than most people drink it. If you're just having a glass (or a liter, hello McDonald's cup) of liquid with every meal, you're not drinking enough (or in the case of a big takeout cup, you're drinking too much)

Avoid high fructose corn syrup. That's all I have to say about that.

Avoid artificial sweeteners. They tend to taste sweeter than sugar and you can accidentally normalize sugar to your system.

Reset your tastebuds. Do a detox. I drank nothing but black tea and water for 3 days to cleanse my system and my palate. Most of us are way too used to extremely high sugar content in food. Because of that, we think foods like fruit are extremely bland. Once you reset your palate you can easily develop a normal relationship with sugar. Things like apples and strawberries will taste as sweet as cakes and pies. You'll eat less junk without even thinking about it.

Choose snacks by texture. Train your brain to say ""I want chips... I want something crunchy... I want carrot sticks"" ""I want chocolate... I want something smooth and sweet... I want blueberries""

Eat lots of soup.

Don't over eat Fibre or foods your body can't process. This was one of my worst mistakes. I spent more time on the toilet... it was bad. A lot of diets are going to tell you to mainline lettuce or peas, or just go feral on corn. If you do... You're going to poop a lot. Now granted, the average person has about 3-8 lbs of poop in their intestine. And granted, you can get a lot of reading done on the toilet, but you've got places to be. Things to do. You need to live!

Don't eat useless greens. Is my hatred for lettuce showing? Look, the world is full of lettuces. You've got spinach, which gives you an iron boost. Kale and bok choy, the nutrient powerhouses. Collard greens and Swiss chard, those love muffins of magnesium and calcium and potassium. Lettuce is like... Solid water with Metamucil mixed in. Stick some Swiss chard on your burger. Fry up some collards or bok. Live a little.

Nothing green has any calories. Except avocadoes. Avocadoes have a million calories and a zillion grams of fat and taste like troll snot, except in guacamole. Mint chip ice cream has no calories however, because it is green. Fite me.

Drink. But don't DAH-RINK. A glass of wine or a few cocktails can relax you after a long day, and reduced stress is a good thing. Some alcohol has positive effects: red wine has antioxidants, vodka sterilizes, bourbon can alleviate cold symptoms. And most alcohol loosens your joints which is good for ongoing health and probably why your alcoholic granny lived to be 97 BUT drinking too much fills you with extra calories and lowers your inhibitions. Or, as my forever tipsy prof once put it: ""for every one drink you think you drunk, you drank 3 drinks you didn't think you drunk, and that's why you don't think you drunk.""

Smoking is bad for your cardio. So is air pollution. I don't smoke, and I lost 40 of those pounds by moving out of a place where I lived with a smoker and into a town with better air quality. I started swimming or running at the gym instead of outside. Basically, if you cant breathe, your workouts will be shorter, because you need oxygen to survive.

Sports. Basically, swimming for an hour burns 400 ish calories. Running burns 300 or so. But swimming lengths or running in circles for 60 full minutes is boring, painful, and misery making. Some people love running, I'm sure they exist. Great for them. I hate running. But can I run for an hour during a 2 hour game of baseball or soccer? How many times do I squat during a volleyball game? And how many tricep pullbacks do I do on a leisurely canoe trip across the lake? I'm not counting... And I'm doing more than I would have just staring at a wall watching it.... wall, or whatever.

Track your progress objectively. Use apps to scan your physique, track body composition changes, and get honest feedback about where you're actually at. The mirror lies to you every day - sometimes you look amazing, sometimes you look like a potato, but it's the same body. Having real data keeps you grounded when the mirror's being a jerk and motivated when you can't see the changes yourself.

Do it now. Don't waste time on ""I wish I could"" Wish you could go to the beach? Go. Wish you could wear a crop top? Do. I had an irrational fear that everyone would hate, scream at, and make fun of me. OK not completely irrational. That's what they did in high school. And some high school kids did it when I started just wearing the bikini as an adult. But a lot more people complimented me, or didn't notice at all. I was just a person. Not a big old ugly spectacle with a neon ""hate me"" sign taped to my forehead.

Don't catfish. Put your whole self on your profiles. Not close ups of your face. Get professional photos taken in an outfit you absolutely love, and own it.

Take care of yourself now. ""I'll get my hair cut when I'm skinny."" ""I'll buy new clothes when I'm skinny"" ""I'll love myself when I'm skinny."" get the haircut now.

Dab on the haters. Or do some other, similarly weird as hell gesture. When people made fun of me, I would sprinkle glitter on them. ""Every time it rains glitter on an asshole, somewhere, a fairy gets its wings"" The looks on their faces were honestly priceless. They'd either look shocked, get angry, or laugh and think I'm awesome. Either way I won. Full disclosure: someone did try to punch me once. That day, I was pretty glad for all the cardio.

Sleep is very important. That's what I want you to tell people when they catch you passing out after your yoga stretch routine at the park. Don't forget to thank them for the coffee money.

1qipeoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1qipeoz/how_to_talk_to_women_without_being_weird_the/,How to Talk to Women Without Being Weird: The Science-Based Guide That Actually Works,"Look, I spent way too much time analyzing conversations, reading psychology books, listening to communication experts, and yes, watching hours of podcast interviews to figure this out. And what I found? Most advice about talking to women is either patronizing garbage or creepy pickup artist nonsense. The truth is simpler and way more interesting.

Here's what nobody tells you: Most guys struggle with conversations because they're performing instead of connecting. They're so busy trying to say the ""right thing"" that they forget to be an actual human. And women? They can smell that anxiety from a mile away. Not because they're psychic, but because we're all wired to detect authenticity. It's evolutionary biology mixed with social conditioning.

The good news? Once you understand how conversation actually works (not how you think it works), everything gets easier. Let me break it down.

Step 1: Kill the Interview Mode

You know what sucks? When a conversation feels like a job interview. ""Where are you from? What do you do? Do you have siblings?"" Boom, boom, boom. Questions with no substance, no follow up, no actual curiosity.

Here's what works:Ask questions that reveal something interesting. Instead of ""What do you do?"" try ""What's something you're working on that you're excited about?"" or ""What's been taking up most of your mental space lately?""

The difference? The first question gets a one word answer. The second one opens doors. You're giving her permission to talk about what actually matters to her, not just recite her LinkedIn profile.

And listen, really listen. Don't just wait for your turn to talk. Author Celeste Headlee's book *We Need to Talk* breaks this down perfectly. She spent years interviewing people as an NPR host and found that the best conversations happen when you genuinely want to know the answer, not when you're stockpiling your next witty comment.

Step 2: Share, Don't Perform

Authenticity beats entertainment every single time. You don't need to be the funniest guy in the room. You just need to be real. Share actual thoughts, not rehearsed lines.

Bad: ""So I'm kind of a Netflix expert, haha.""  
Better:""I've been weirdly obsessed with documentaries about cults lately. It's like watching a psychological trainwreck you can't look away from.""

See the difference? The second one has personality. It's specific. It invites conversation. And if she's into it, boom, you've got something to explore together. If not? That's fine too. Move on to something else.

Brené Brown's research on vulnerability (check out *Daring Greatly* if you want your mind blown) shows that people connect over realness, not perfection. When you share something genuine, even if it's awkward, you give the other person permission to do the same. That's where actual connection lives.

Step 3: Master the Art of Noticing

Women drop hints constantly. Not in some cryptic, decode the matrix way. Just normal human communication cues. She mentions she loves cooking? Don't just nod and move on. Ask what she made recently. Ask what got her into it. Ask if she's the kind of person who follows recipes or wings it.

This is called active engagement.You're building on what she's giving you instead of waiting to insert your own topic.

Psychologist John Gottman (the guy who can predict divorce with scary accuracy) found that successful relationships are built on people who ""turn toward"" each other's bids for attention. Same applies to conversations. When someone shares something, they're testing if you care. Show them you do.

Step 4: Stop Trying to Fix Things

Here's a mistake almost every guy makes: A woman shares a problem or frustration, and you immediately jump into solution mode. ""Oh, you should just..."" or ""Have you tried...?""

Stop. Just stop.

Most of the time, people aren't looking for solutions. They're looking for empathy, validation, or just someone to listen. That doesn't mean you can't offer advice, but lead with understanding first.

Try: ""That sounds frustrating"" or ""Yeah, I can see why that would suck."" Let her vent. If she wants your input, she'll ask. This isn't about being passive. It's about recognizing what someone actually needs in the moment.

The app Ash (it's like having a relationship coach in your pocket) has tons of micro lessons on this exact dynamic. Super helpful for building emotional intelligence without feeling like you're in therapy.

Step 5: Get Comfortable With Silence

Silence freaks people out. We feel this pressure to fill every gap with words. But silence isn't the enemy. Awkward rambling is.

Good conversations breathe.They have pauses. Moments where both people are just thinking or enjoying the vibe. Don't panic and word vomit to fill the space.

If there's a natural lull, that's fine. Smile. Look around. Make an observation about something nearby. Or just own it: ""My brain just went blank for a second there."" Humor and honesty beat nervous chatter.

Step 6: Ditch the Agenda

The fastest way to kill a conversation is walking into it with an agenda. If you're only talking to her because you want something (a date, validation, whatever), she's going to feel it. And it's going to feel gross.

Approach conversations with genuine curiosity.Not every interaction needs to lead somewhere. Sometimes, it's just cool to meet someone interesting and have a good chat. That's it. No pressure, no weird expectations.

When you remove the outcome obsession, you relax. And when you relax, you're way more fun to talk to. It's a self fulfilling cycle.

Step 7: Learn to Tell Stories (Not Monologues)

There's a difference between sharing a story and hijacking the conversation. Good stories are short, have a point, and invite reaction. Bad stories are long, meandering, and make the other person check out mentally.

Structure matters.Set up the context quickly, get to the interesting part, land it with a punchline or insight, and pass the ball back to her.

Example: ""I went hiking last weekend and got completely lost. Had to use moss on trees to figure out which way was north like some budget Bear Grylls. Have you ever been that level of unprepared for something?""

Short. Relatable. Gives her an easy way to jump in.

Matthew Dicks' book *Storyworthy* is incredible for this. He teaches how to find the moments in your life worth sharing and how to tell them without boring people to death. Seriously good stuff.

Step 8: Match Energy, Don't Force It

If she's chill and low key, don't come in with high energy chaos. If she's animated and excited, don't be a monotone robot. **Mirroring is real.** It's how humans build rapport subconsciously.

This doesn't mean being fake. It means being socially aware. Pay attention to her tone, pace, body language, and adjust naturally. You're creating a rhythm together, not performing a solo act.

Step 9: Know When to Exit

Not every conversation is going to click. And that's fine. If it's not flowing, don't force it. Politely wrap it up and move on with your life.

""It was nice talking to you. Catch you later."" Done. No drama, no weird explanations. Just a clean exit.

Knowing when to let go is just as important as knowing how to engage. You can't connect with everyone, and trying to is exhausting.

Step 10: Practice Like Your Life Depends on It

You don't get good at conversation by reading about it. You get good by doing it. A lot. Talk to strangers. Talk to cashiers. Talk to people at coffee shops, bars, the gym, wherever. The more reps you get, the less you overthink it.

The app Finch is great for building social habits and tracking progress. It gamifies self improvement in a way that doesn't feel preachy. Plus, it's low key adorable.

For anyone serious about leveling up their social skills long term, there's also BeFreed, an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia that pulls from relationship psychology experts, communication research, and books like the ones mentioned here. You can set a goal like ""improve conversation skills with women"" and it generates a personalized learning plan, complete with audio lessons you can listen to during your commute. The depth is adjustable too, anywhere from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with real examples. It's been solid for connecting the dots between all this advice and actually internalizing it.

Conversations aren't this mystical art form. They're a skill. And like any skill, you get better with practice, feedback, and a willingness to screw up sometimes. So get out there. Be curious. Be real. And stop treating women like they're a different species. They're just people trying to have a good time, same as you.",1,1768973535.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

The framework for on topic responses is not whether speciesism is ethical nor excusable, the paradigm i will be exploring first expects all speakers to accept the framework that in this scenario speciesism and questions of sentience are not valid arguments. Please formulate commentary based upon the agreed upon thought experiment that we are all in unision that species specific rape is still rape. 

Concept: i know an orthorexic who cannot bring himself to eat any animal product because he is a trafficking victim and he conveys ""i'm saying what was done to me is okay if i endorse rape upon other living beings."" 

I understand his framework but he has a lot of food allergies too so he basically isn't eating. He drinks vegetable stock for breakfast, survives on teas and coffees, is allergic to grains and beans and soy and gluten and most protein sources. Eats coconut yoghurt for lunch and stirfryed vegetables and seeds for dinner. 

He is wasting away. No amount of fruits and vegetables will ever sustain him. I have witnessed him pass out multiple times. He is a brilliant soul with a huge brain but is almost too smart and too empathetic to the point he demonizes himself if he needs nutrition because he is overly aware that everything we have to eat relies on a broken system that forcibly rapes animals so that we can have animals and animal byproducts to consume. 

I will not argue with him that it isn't rape. I understand he is right they are not consenting to being inseminated so that we can eat their young and drink their nip juice. 

I need help coming up with ethical framework that works within his belief system so that he will stop punishing himself for needing to eat eggs and milk to survive. Yes he has therapists, yes he has doctors. I am his only friend though who knows what is going on and he opens up about the way he can't separate the responsibility out from the action and how it makes him feel like he is the same type of monster who abused him if he eats within the factory farming system. We live in the city. There are no farms. He talks to me sometimes about how if he eats animal products he feels like he is saying what was done to him was acceptable and that he just wasn't important enough to save because animals aren't important enough to protect and in his belief system he always says things like ""what makes me better than a cow? Why would me suffering be more significant than the torture they exist in?"" It is an endless loop of shame and fear circling the drain w him. 

I asked what I could do to help and he told me needs me to argue with him. He needs help challenging the thoughts because he doesn't want to have orthorexia and he doesn't want to die but he needs ethical reframing and he keeps countering his own arguments any time he tries to do it by himself. He tries asking his therapist to argue his ethics too but she isn't very intellectual and just says ""freewill"" and ""choice"" and ""self preservation"" arguments instead of comprehensive augmentations of the thought projections themselves.

I want to help cuz i understand what he is having issues with and he responds really well to ethos confrontation and debates but I admit I don't know how to argue this debate when I honestly think he's right that we are all being complicit of mass rape. And I am not vegan. But I can't argue that he is fundamentally wrong because he unintentionally got me drinking the koolaid and now I can't stop wondering if we are all evil for allowing this situation to have gotten so far. 

How would you argue against his ethos? I am failing. I need smarter people than I am.",2,1768973458.0,Ethics,0,0.67,False

For the last 2 years that I have been in Kochi, I have worked in fields that don’t let me sleep at night, are really stressful and offer only a complete lack of peace of mind. I am not someone that chill out in groups, nor do I have the luxury of similarly minded roommates. So something I have the habit of doing is go to cafes with a good ambience and have a cup of tea and maybe munch on some snacks.

For the maybe half an hour that I take to finish the tea and snacks I usually am functioning with my brain on power saving mood. But then the fuckin’ ‘Thaikkudam Paalam’ shows up and starts singing as if the entire cafe requested them to entertain them. They even start taking recommendations. Lemme elaborate a few incidents, that personally ente chora thilappichadhu.

Had an enormous fight with my long-distance girlfriend one day and went to Panampilly Park to touch grass, literally. 20+ people shows up and sits in a circle and starts singing ‘Njaanum njaanumentaalum’. It improved my mood tho since now I was angry at them instead of thinking about my girlfriend. Had a shitty day at work one day and decided to go alone to Cafe Stories at Vyttila. Accidentally walked in to close to 10 people singing ‘Enthe innum vanneella’ in unison and I thought to myself, “Idhonda njaan varaathe”.

Worked late one day and realised it was already 4AM but the work wasn’t getting nowhere so decided to get a cup of coffee and visited a nearby cafe to clear my mind, but nope. I saw a guy holding a guitar surrounded by 5 young women and instantly knew what was gonna happen. I think he saw my “Not this shit again” face and got louder. It was the most infuriating rendition of ‘Ambalappuzhe’ that I have had to sit through.

Maybe I’m getting too old for this shit or maybe I’m right, but in my opinion singing in public places shouldn’t be the norm cos you can have so many different kinds of people going through a variety of crap that may just want some peace of mind. I have a pair of good noise cancelling headphones but not everyone has the luxury. So I request anyone that plans on getting their ass out in public to sing in groups, please, don’t, talk to people, get some help.",10,1768973431.0,Kochi,2,0.92,False
1qipdd9,https://i.redd.it/frugv4c72neg1.jpeg,Finished hacker’s memory thoughts (spoilers),"Overall, I enjoyed hacker’s memory a lot. It felt like a good step up from the first game in terms of characters, boss fights, Digimon variety early on, and areas being more diverse than cyber only. Was a great time and I can see myself going back to it for many play through. Here are my thoughts on the game, the good, the bad, and little annoyances. 

# The Good

Man, are these characters so much better! Don’t get me wrong, I like cast of the first game a good deal. However, these characters are fleshed out more. Heck, even more relatable. Ryuji was more than distant person. He went through hell with the loss of his parents. Having to deal with his sister’s condition. Pretty much not letting her have the most normal life. Going through the loss of his buddy Chitose during the events of the game really hurt him. It was sad to see this badass guy who gave you a chance, turn into the worst version of himself. Great character. Same for the hudie characters. Erika is funny, but is sweet with some cute moments sprinkled in. Chitose is a fun character to be around and is a total bro. Liked how the boss fights were an actual challenge even one was super annoying (you know the one!), but I liked it compared to how the bosses in CS didn’t put much of a fight minus like 3 or 4 fights. Love the variety in areas! Erika’s one was a highlight. The ending was a lot more hitting the feels and got me more. Such an emotional ending. Makes it hurt more knowing only the main character remembers Erika. 

# The Bad

Yu Yu Yu Yu…… as well as K felt wasted in the middle. I wanted more of this! The start of the game was great. Was super invested into it. Then the villain spoils himself to be Yu and it just felt like going with the motion. Honestly, I wished the mystery of who K was would have been more hidden until later. Did get a bit of a forgot he was there when for a good bit of the game, K doesn’t show up as well. Then showing up all of sudden. Made me go “oh yeah you are here”. Sucked more when I wish we had more time with Yu. I liked the cute little “date” you had with him. yu’s struggles of not being confident was a good idea with the added fact of a Digimon amplifying it to its toxic extreme.it just sucks we don’t get more moments with him. Also, anyone hate that stupid case about the coffee guy? Wish we had a chance to fight him. It really made no sense for the memory wipe stuff. It was pure greed overall. Wasn’t noble what so ever. Which brings up another thing, why do so many cases end the same? Im talking more about the side quests. It’s like every Digimon ends with I am wrong and leaves. Made me wish there were more moments like the Minervamon dating case in CS, the spooky ones, and more. It also felt near the ending the game, a lot of cases felt totally random. Wish we had more story than random cases just for the sake to give some characters a cool moment to shine. 

# Annoyances

Why can’t I press a simple button for accelerate? I know this was made for the ps vita, but would have been nice instead of having to access it through your hacking skills. Kinda of like Pokémon soul silver. Heck, I won’t mind holding down a button for it! Be better! Did hate how late you get the spirit Digimon like Lobomon and Agunimon. Wish they came around chapter 5 or 6. Same for their beast forms to come out around chapter 10 or 11. Would have made them way more fun to use. Last annoyance I had was I wish more case areas weren’t usually the same. It’s like you go through the same pattern of the game more often than even CS. Wish there was more diverse areas you go to in the cases instead of the same cyber space with the same patterns. 

These are my thoughts on the game overall. Again, I love this game. It’s an amazing game with great moments. A huge step up from the original. Super glad I finally played this title. Makes me excited for future play through a with the new gameplus feature in the complete edition. Able to transfer Digimon around makes me already wonder what team to make for next play through. If you finished hacker’s memory, what did you think of the game? Curious what other people thoughts on this game. ",7,1768973423.0,digimon,0,1.0,False

1qipar9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qipar9/i_love_you_and_hate_you/,I love you and hate you,"It’s been one month since you broke up with me. I want to heal so so badly, but I can’t fathom that you hurt me this bad.

I title 9d your assaulter on your behalf, even after constantly asking you if it’s okay, if it’s the right thing to do and you say yes, it is and that you believe in me. But ever since I did that I lost so many people who I thought I could call close friends. They stopped saying hi to me at the meetings, they stopped talking to me, and they leave me on read when I try to reconnect with them. After two months of enduring that type of loneliness I quit. I couldn’t handle it anymore.

Then you break up with me the day right after. After I lost so many friends, so many relationships. At my absolute rock bottom. You break up with me. Then 5 hours of talking you decide you don’t want to break up anymore. I cried so much that night, hoping things can just go back to normal.

Then the day after you come over and we get coffee, I keep asking you are you sure you don’t want to break up with me. And you reassure me you don’t. I trusted you. Then we go on a date talking about the issues with me and how to fix it. We had the same issues…but I’d never break up with you for being depressed and being lonely, and hating yourself. I know I have to love my self and put my self out there, but I just quit my dream job. I vented to you about it, and you say you’ll always be there for me and listen to me, but you weren’t. You broke up with me a day later. Then unbroke up with me.

Then after talking to your roommate and mom about how you’re losing your sense of self you break up with me again. All before my birthday, and all before you were supposed to come with me on vacation. You promised me a birthday cake.

I got you a promise ring. I cooked for you all the time. I brought homemade food to you during your shifts. I’d spend time with you. I dropped whatever it was that I was doing my for you. But you still decided I’m not worth loving anymore :(

I miss you, every night I miss you. During classes today I couldn’t even pay attention, I miss you so much. I miss your good morning texts. I miss everything about you. I cooked for your family, I got you flowers all the time, I wrote you letters as much as I could. I thought I was a good boyfriend. You promised me you would never break up with me, that we would get married. That we’d have two daughters and name them Azula and sienna. I can’t even listen to the artist I shared with you anymore.

But at the same time I hate you. How could you break up with me at my absolute lowest when I just lost half of my identity, then you break up with me and I lose my whole self.

I thought you blocked me on everything, that’s why I sent those disgusting text to you. I’m so so sorry I did, I was just so upset that you broke up with me at possibly the worst ever timing.

I wish you were more empathetic. I love you, but I also hate you.

I hope to never see you again. I don’t want to ever love someone that hard ever again.

Up until last year, Qatar was my absolute non negotiable when it comes to flying. Since last year things have declined big time.

Aircrafts not properly cleaned. Crew is overworked and it shows. Service on the plane takes 2x the time it used to. Al safwa lounge is constantly overcrowded and there’s never rooms available. Last minute aircraft changes. WiFi sucks unless you are lucky to get starlink. But starlink only works across certain counties. 

I just had a 4h flight from India to Doha, the first coffee I was offered was 2h in the flight. Then after landing I was tired, wanted to get some rest, heading to Al Safwa as the exclusive first class lounge would be the best choice, right? Going in, it’s like a circus, people shouting, running, no chairs to sit. I just left and went downstairs by the end of C gates, much better.

Anyway, obviously all this is first world problems - I just hope that consumers get what they pay for :)

You’re not alone. So many people in their 20s and 30s are secretly struggling with making meaningful connections, especially those who identify as socially awkward, introverted, or anxious. The loudest advice often comes from influencers recycling outdated clichés like “just put yourself out there” or “fake it till you make it.” That doesn’t help much when small talk feels like a hostage negotiation.

This post is a breakdown of practical, research-backed strategies to actually *build friendships*, even if socializing doesn’t come naturally to you. Pulled from top-tier books, behavior science, and expert interviews so you're not stuck with shallow, viral hacks.

Let’s make this simple.

- **Use repeated exposure to your advantage**  
The “mere exposure effect” is a well-documented psychological phenomenon: we tend to like people we see often. A study from MIT found college students became closer friends *simply* because their dorm rooms were closer together. In real life? Join the same yoga class each week. Go to the same coffee shop. You don’t need to be charming, just visible.

- **Stop chasing charisma, start signaling warmth**  
According to Dr. Marisa Franco, author of *Platonic*, people become friends with those they perceive as warm and *interested*. The biggest mistake awkward people make? Trying to be impressive instead of *present*. Ask questions. Comment on stuff around you. You don’t need a punchline, just engagement.

- **Assume people like you more than you think**  
Harvard research on the “liking gap” shows most people *underestimate* how much others enjoy their company. That spiral of overthinking every weird thing you said? Probably just in your head. People are more forgiving and distracted than you think.

- **Don’t wait to be invited, initiate, even awkwardly**  
Friendships don’t just happen. According to psychologist Robin Dunbar, real intimacy takes about 50 hours of contact to go from acquaintance to casual friend. So yeah, it’s gonna feel weird texting “Hey want to grab a coffee?” the first few times. Do it anyway.

- **Practice “scaffolding” conversations**  
Dr. Julie Smith on YouTube explains how socially anxious people benefit from mental frameworks. Start with small questions: “What kind of music are you into?” Then let it evolve from topic to topic. If it fizzles, no big deal, it’s practice, not performance.

- **You don’t need a big group, just one good one**  
The truth? Quality over quantity. A study in [*The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Social_and_Personal_Relationships) shows that just one close friendship can drastically improve well-being. So stop measuring your social life by your follower count.

- **Be consistent, not perfect**  
Real connection forms slowly. You don’t need to be funny or extroverted every time you hang out. Just *keep showing up*. Loneliness researcher John Cacioppo found consistency builds trust faster than charm ever could.

Social awkwardness isn’t a flaw, it’s just a different baseline. The key isn’t to become a different person, it’s to build a system that works *with* your personality.

The Italian name adds perceived value that chocolate cake wouldn't have despite similar ingredients and preparation. We've decided that foreign language names make food more sophisticated and worth appreciating.

They'd ordered it from a bakery that specializes in Italian desserts marketed at premium prices. Later admitted they'd seen similar cakes from wholesale suppliers on Alibaba but wanted guaranteed quality for the party. The tiramisu was fine but not noticeably better than cheaper alternatives with less impressive names.

We pay premiums for products whose perceived value comes mainly from exotic terminology rather than actual superior quality. The tiramisu cake could have been called coffee cream cake and tasted identical but commanded less respect and attention. Maybe the name matters for enjoyment, maybe believing something is special makes it special regardless of objective quality.

As a bonus yesterday we had a raging snow storm, forecasted 20 cm, when I left my shift my car and the roads were covered. My boyfriend insisted I stay at his place, it was a much shorter drive and would be safer for me, I hardly got there due to the roads alone. On my way over one of the transformers on the power lines exploded, it was super loud, there was a flash of light, and then no power across the board. It was quite the drive, snow covered roads where I barely made it up hills and it was really dark, no power to any houses or traffic lights.

When I finally got to my boyfriend’s house I slipped into bed with him, we spoke briefly about my crazy drive and eventually I fell asleep with him wrapped around me. Finally safe and able to slow down.

I slept until at least 3 pm. I woke up to extra blankets put on me, he was worried I’d get cold as the power and heat had not come back until 1 pm. The storm had calmed down by now, there was still snow but not near as much and sadly I had to go back to work soon. He made me a cup of coffee and I drank it while I wore one of his sweaters. Without even thinking he told me he would dig my car out of the snow while I hopped in the shower and got ready for work.

I’m a very independent person and would never *ask* for all of these things, but it’s nice to think that I deserve them. Theres something about the night shift and the exhaustion that makes me feel vulnerable in a way. There’s also something about that morning that is so intimate to me. Earlier that day he was insisting I could get in bed with him and that waking him wouldn’t bother him at all, or that he’d even sleep on the couch if I wanted his bed to myself. Not to mention refusing the option that I slept on the couch entirely. Putting more blankets on me while I slept.

My step by step analysis on how I did it, and my thoughts. Hope it helps. (Originally posted on r/gatewaytapes) (Also looking for some insight)","This is a software developer's analysis of how I had an OBE, how I got there and my thoughts.

Before losing my wife and son almost two years ago, my core belief was based on science and physicality. The generic non-spiritual backstory.

After spending months searching for the reason why something like this happened and finding nothing, I ran across a video on YouTube from The Why Files ""The Gateway Process: the CIA's Classified Space & Time Travel System That You Can Learn (Really)""

I've never cared for meditation or anything spiritual, but after watching this video and learning that it was studied by the CIA, it seemed to give it some credibility in my eyes.

While unable to get out of bed due to my struggle with grief, I got an eye mask and a pair of noise canceling headphones, and gave the Gateway tapes a shot.

I did not know an OBE was possible with these tapes it was not my goal, I was just using them to help ""heal"" and give me the strength to continue life for my older son. Maybe get some answers as well.

My OBE occurred after a year of 4-5 tapes per week. This is how I achieved it, it may or may not work for you, but I wish I had a break down like this when I started.

***Prerequisites:***

***Noise canceling over-ear headphones.***

***Completely dark eye-mask.***

***Don't be sleepy.***

***Don't be hungry.***

***Go to the washroom before you start.***

***Do not expect anything to happen.***

# Required Focus Levels:

**Focus 10**

After a month of the gateway tapes, I thought I had perfected Focus 10. Feeling like my body wasn't really there anymore but still felt like I was present.

After 6 months of feeling ""stuck"" at Focus 15, I decided to restart the whole process. Only then did I realized I had no idea what Focus 10 was really suppose to be like.

Focus 10 should feel like your body is completely gone, your heart beat and breath should all fade away, you shouldn't be able to feel your chest rise from your breath either. You should feel like you're floating in your own mind.

The goal is to relax every muscle in your body, it helps to do this with every exhale. Your face muscles are the hardest to relax, this will take a lot of practice.

Your body literally falls asleep.

This just takes a lot of practice, nothing more to really say about it.

I'm able to accomplish this in about 5 minutes now.

***Focus 12 (Mind Asleep, consciousness awake)***

Getting to this point for me was all about letting everything go after reaching the proper Focus 10. While floating in your mind, let go of everything. This step is the hardest to achieve correctly. It is strictly a mental release, no more thoughts, no more questions and especially no words!

**Important:**

\-Do not narrate, if you hear yourself talking in your mind, STOP IT! (this is very hard to accomplish)

\-Do not analyze what you see, don't ask questions about what you see or feel. No ""what's that light there?"" (this is very hard to accomplish)

\-Do not try to control what you see, if you start to direct what you see like a movie, STOP IT!

\-Just observe what you see and feel, you can ""move"" through it or ""interact"" with it by using the ""**non-verbal communication**"" exercises. Again, no words!

At first I would see random lights or shapes or blobs floating around. Try to just observe whatever it is you see, so your consciousness stays awake.

After a few minutes of random shapes, I start seeing ""4K"" images (if normal vision was 1080P), but its clouded. Like looking at an image but there's moving black smoke randomly covering different parts of the image. I would try to focus on the parts of the image that I could see, and try to feel the texture of materials in the image to help me ""connect"" with what I saw.

You will feel like you're in a different location?

*It will not feel like a dream, it feels like you are actually floating in nothingness. If it feels like a dream, you may have fallen asleep.*

This part takes me about 10-15 minutes to get to.

**Automatic Focus 15?**

Try to constantly focus on the clear parts of the image, sometimes it changes. Whether its a forest, or a room, try to focus on the parts you can see, and try to force the smoke to clear up.

Sometimes it will jump back and forth from random shapes/blobs/lights to images, and repeat. Just keep going, and eventually for me, I would see a wall of a single texture. Like fabric or leather, and I will try to ""feel"" the texture. **OR** The image will just completely clear up, no more smoke blocking the view. It will be more clear than normal vision with your eyes.

At this point you will feel like you're completely floating in nothingness and will be able to control your experience. Your senses seem to all merge into one, and you can ""see"" around the void in a 360 view.

For me this only lasts 1-2 minutes before my OBE started.

I've only reached this twice.

# OBE

**First Near OBE:**

I did not do any research on OBE the first time I had the experience because I did not know it was possible, so I didn't know it was happening.

While floating in the void, I was suddenly standing in front of a building. Then I started to float upwards and a very loud noise started ringing in my ears. While I was trying to figure out what was going on, I felt like a giant hand grabbed my head and tried to pull me out of my body?

I just NOPED it out of there, instantly got up and left the room. I was not ready for it. It is very scary.

**Second OBE:**

After doing some research, everything I experienced was ""normal"" for an OBE. I tried again, and again, and again. It took me 3 months to get back to where I was. I believe because I was hoping for it to happen, that it didn't. You need to not expect anything to happen.

Eventually it happened again. This time I was ready, so I thought.

The exact same thing happened. I was floating in the void, and suddenly I was floating in the clouds. Again, I started floating upwards and a loud ringing started to deafen me. I read that I was suppose to ""get up"" at the peak of the ringing, so I did. I sat up, and looked around. I was confused, because I felt that nothing happened, it didn't work?

I realized I was looking around, but I had my eye mask on. So how am I looking around? then I turned around and saw myself. I freaked out, and suddenly was pulled back? I felt my body pivot at the hip like how you would sit up from a laying position, but it felt like my body and ""spirit"" were trying to reconnect, the pivot was glitchy and violent. As if the two were trying to reconnect and wasn't fully connecting. It felt like I was spazzing up and down as if I was doing sit-ups, but faster than humanly possible.

Everything feels normal when you are out. Confusingly normal. I was not out for long so I can't comment too much on it.

We've been preparing for the holidays and my son's been on Christmas break so I haven't been able to try again for awhile.

100% would recommend.

**Key Notes:**

I used the Gateway tapes up to Focus 21 as training, I did not get my OBEs using the tapes. They aren't long enough to achieve it, and they have too much talking. So for me they are for training only.

*\*\*\**

Make sure the volume isn't too loud where it is distracting, but loud enough to help muffle external noises. It should feel like background noise.

Do not expect anything to happen.

Do not use ""words"" in your mind.

Just observe and let it happen.

**Random Thoughts**

I'm not sure if its my body and mind are actually falling asleep while my consciousness is awake to achieve these experiences or if I'm tricking my body into thinking I'm dying. Sometimes during Focus 12, I would randomly gasp for air as if I wasn't breathing. Maybe I'm slowing my breathing down so much that my heartrate decreases and my body thinks I'm dead? maybe, maybe not. Just a thought.

*\*\*\**

*EDIT:*

*Do not drink coffee or take anything that will make your heart beat louder. It will make getting to F10 harder.*

*Use an eye mask that has a foam border around the edges, so that the mask doesn't press against your eyes. It lets you relax your face muscles easier, without making weird distorted visual images that you get when you press your eyes.*

*In the video link I provided, I've never gotten to focus 15 after the 34min mark. When the river sound starts, is when I would stop trying as well, or I would restart the video if I have time to try again.*

*The floating up sensation I felt during F15 wasn't just a visual thing, it felt like I was actually flying upwards before the OBE experience started.*

	•	My main interests are adventure activities:

	•	Scuba diving / snorkeling / sea walking

	•	Paragliding or similar experiences

	•	I’d also like to include experiential and cultural activities:

	•	Pottery or craft workshops

	•	Coffee making / café experiences

	•	I enjoy shopping, especially local markets and unique souvenirs.

My questions:

	1.	With only 6–7 days, is it necessary to visit North, Central, and South Vietnam to experience the country well?

	2.	Would it be better to focus on just one region to avoid rushed travel?

	3.	If focusing on one region, which region would you recommend based on the interests above, and why?

	4.	For travel within Vietnam (inter-city / inter-regional travel), what is the fastest mode of transport?

	5.	What is the most economical mode of transport for covering short to medium distances?

	6.	Are domestic flights worth it for a short itinerary like this, or do trains/buses make more sense?

Thank you in advance for your suggestions and advice!",1,1768972083.0,Vietnam_Tourism,1,1.0,False

The event was packed and in order to fit everyone in the door, she invited fans to sit all around her on the stage as she played stripped back keyboard arrangements from songs off Pang.  She was a bit under the weather so requested no video taken but I got some audio from the event and made a video out of it.  The setlist was written on a paper coffee filter haha.

Afterwards, fans who preordered or bought the album got to meet Caroline and get the album signed.  She actually just played a show the night before in Brooklyn and I had snuck in a banana to wave and throw on stage during ""So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings"" show me the banana segment.  She picked up the banana after the song and put it to her ear.  Upon hearing that was me she offered me a banana in return from the fruit basket next to her. 2020 was going so damn good, it all had to be nerfed by covid, which shut everything down not too long after this.  I'm glad this all happened before though.  Crazy times.

I am a woman in my mid 20s and this happened at my last job. The colleague involved was an older white male in his 50s. We worked at a housing company. He worked in IT and I worked in marketing. He’d be in the office everyday from 7am because he lived 10 mins away, however, I only worked in the office 2 days a week and the rest at home, this was great for me as I was 2 hours away by public transport.

At first, this colleague seemed friendly. We didn’t really talk much at the start, but things escalated after I confided in him about a frightening incident on public transport on my way home from work where a man nearly attacked me. I was extremely shaken up and vulnerable at the time, I even had to contact the police. After that, this colleague began messaging me daily on Microsoft Teams during work hours and also after work hours, although I only ever saw those messages the next day. He was very conversational and initially seemed supportive. I also mentioned I had injured my shoulder from a fall and he offered advice, claiming he took a massage course. Eventually we exchanged phone numbers, which I did not think much of as I had exchanged numbers with other colleagues.

Not long after, his behaviour changed and became VERY inappropriate.

After I mentioned my injury and the fact I had to go to physio at a local gym, he started talking about how he goes to the gym and sauna every day. I initially engaged because I also enjoy going to the gym, but the conversations quickly became uncomfortable. One day he told me he had been swimming and using the sauna and said he was worried he would not be able to fit into his swimming pants because they were “too small” for him. I was completely disgusted and immediately changed the subject.

He then repeatedly suggested that I go to the gym and sauna with him after work because he had a guest pass. I politely declined every time. He would not stop asking or suggesting. He later suggested that I come to his house during a work break so he could massage my injured shoulder. I declined. I tried to redirect conversations back to work or neutral topics like music and films, but he used this as an opportunity to invite me to his house to watch movies. He told me he has lots of films on his hard drives and uploads pictures, videos and music to them daily…

He constantly brought the conversation back to the sauna. He told me he goes to another sauna every few weeks that is a nude sauna. He then said he had done nude photoshoots and asked if I wanted to see his explicit pictures. I did not respond because I was so disturbed. The next day he messaged me good morning and changed the subject.

During another conversation, he kept talking about how girls at the gym and sauna check out his body and like how he looks. I although I don’t what he said, I found it quite unsettling that he always referred to women as “girls”.

Things escalated further when he sent me a screenshot of a teenage girl’s TikTok video during work hours. The girl was wearing a crop top, hoodie and underwear and had two piercings near her belly button. He said “Just watched a TikTok and a girl has piercing on her side? Ever seen it before, looks painful.” At that point I was extremely disturbed. I stopped responding and began avoiding him in the office. Luckily, I was only in the office two days a week so it was easier to avoid him.

I told a few family members what was happening and told them I was considering reporting him. They advised me not to because at this point, I only had a few weeks left of my month contract. I avoided him as advised and didn’t report it.

After I stopped engaging, he began acting strangely at work. He sulked around the office, avoided greeting me and would not say goodbye. I was relieved, but he then began intentionally singling me out. One day I went for a coffee break with a colleague and when I returned I was completely locked out of my work laptop. I had not entered the wrong password and only attempted to log in once. Because he worked in IT, I had to go to him as the other IT guy was busy. He was visibly delighted and suddenly cheerful. After that, the messages started again. And he was cheerful around the office again, but way more than before! He was singing and dancing, and super loud!

I have no proof, but I strongly believe he locked me out on purpose to force contact. I went along with messaging again because it felt like he was signalling that he could make my remaining weeks difficult.

At this point, none of our conversations were about work. Every single conversation included the sauna. He later told me he had done a nude photoshoot in a sauna with a woman he met on a modelling website, then asked me if I would be interested in doing one with him. I immediately shut that down and said no.

He began confiding in me about his past relationships and then asked about mine. He asked personal questions about sex and asked if I was curious because I had never been in a relationship. I said no.

I deliberately gave short, dry replies or asked him questions so he could talk about himself instead of asking me things. Even when I did not respond, he kept messaging. He always returned to the sauna topic. His persistence felt frightening and violating… almost rapey. It felt like he would not stop until I said yes.

I never flirted with him. I am not attracted to older men and I am socially awkward and shy, I don’t flirt at all, so I know I did not give him the wrong impression. I declined every invitation and did nothing to encourage him, yet he continued. I felt guilty for wanting to report him because I was new and he had worked there for five years. He was well liked and respected and I feared not being believed.

Near the end of my contract, my replies became shorter. He asked what I planned to do next and I lied and said I wanted to move into cyber security. He offered help and before I could reply, he created a Dropbox account, sent me the login and said he had uploaded resources. He then made another account and said he would upload films from his hard drive. I never logged into either account and never will. He had previously told me he knows how to hack, and I would not be surprised if he uploaded spyware on the files or even the nude photos he so desperately wanted me to see. When I told my uncle about this, he said this behaviour sounded like grooming.

Later that week, it was raining heavily and my commute was difficult. My commute was two hours daily, which everyone knew. He messaged me and when I said it was a struggle, he said “If you brought some clothes with you, you could’ve stayed at mine.” Even in my final days, he would not stop.

On my last day, days before Christmas, he worked from home but signed a thank you card with the rest of the office. I messaged to thank him, just like I messaged everyone else and he replied saying we should keep in contact and meet up one day. I brushed it off.

After my contract ended, he told me he had resigned two days later. He said the manager was a “b\*tch” and kept picking on him, and that he was due to have a disciplinary but did not say why. He said he already had a new job and told me the company name and pay. I congratulated him. Soon after he wished me a happy new year, I blocked him.

I feel deep regret and shame for not reporting him at the time. I am now considering reporting him to both the previous company and his new employer. I’ve exported the entire chat and taken screenshots. He starts his new role in February. I keep thinking about the possibility of him doing this to another young woman. What I experienced was disturbing and exhausting and I do not want anyone else to go through it. What if his weird pushy, coercive behaviour actually works on a young, impressionable woman? I feel I should do something. Please offer advice. I’ve never experienced anything like this before.",2,1768971799.0,careerguidance,3,0.63,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My partner and I are moving to Miami and looking for the right neighborhood. We’re both 27/28, work remotely, and make decent money, but we’re not into the bro culture or heavy nightlife scene.

We’re drawn to Coconut Grove for its old money vibes and more low-key atmosphere. We want a place that feels like the Miami locals actually know about - not the flashy, Instagram-heavy spots.

Ideally looking for:

	∙	A duplex or spacious apartment with a terrace

	∙	Somewhere we can host dinner parties with friends

	∙	Fancy but understated - think established neighborhoods with character

	∙	Walking distance to good coffee shops, local restaurants, green spaces

Is Coconut Grove the move, or are there other hidden gem neighborhoods we should be looking at? Looking for that “if you know, you know” vibe.

I'll be down next week for a month to begin with as I'll be taking care of my father after his surgery on his hernia. I have been seeing a lot of posting online for mostly healthcare positions and I've never really had an office or corporate gig or anything other than retail and prior Navy experience. My father lives in Yuma so that's where I'm going to mostly be, but I'm looking for any kind of help in getting my foot in some doors. I'm mostly looking at Operations Assistant, and other positions relating to that. Hell even a sales gig would be fine since I'm good with building connections with customers (clients in corporate) and making people feel comfortable and bringing them back in as repeat customers or full time clients.

Currently I'm only getting $1808/month and I'm expecting rent and things like that to be somewhat expensive in Yuma but I haven't looked yet as I also want to see first hand while I'm there what the market looks like. I do have one dog who's almost 10 y.o. so I'd have to find a pet friendly place. any help or advice would be much appreciated before my trip! And I'm also in the market for friends as well! So if anyone would want to meet for coffee or even show me around Yuma that'd be awesome too!

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1qioeug,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelrecos/comments/1qioeug/is_camden_maine_worth_visiting/,"Is Camden, Maine worth visiting?","**Yes,** Camden is one of those small towns that somehow feels quintessentially 'New England' without being too touristy or fake. If you like charming coastal towns, scenic harbors, easy hikes and a vibe that’s equal parts chill and picturesque, it’s worth a trip.

I visited over a long weekend and I could’ve stayed a week just to take it all in. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know if you’re thinking of heading there.

**Getting There**  
Camden isn’t exactly in the middle of nowhere but it’s not a big city either. Most people fly into **Portland International Jetport** (about 1.5 hours south by car) or **Bangor** (roughly 2 hours north). Boston is doable too if you’re coming from further away but it’s a good 4-hour drive. You’ll need a car no matter what because the town itself is walkable but the cool stuff is Camden Hills trails, scenic overlooks and even some beaches outside downtown.

Tip: Gas up before you hit Camden, there aren’t many stations once you’re in town.

**The Harbor and Downtown Vibe**  
The first thing you notice is the **harbor.** Sailboats bobbing in the water, historic brick buildings lining the streets, small parks and a mix of coffee shops, boutiques and art galleries. It’s the kind of harbor where you could spend an entire afternoon just walking, sitting on benches or people-watching.

Downtown Camden has that small-town charm without feeling like a museum. There are shops selling local art, vintage finds, handmade soaps, and of course, plenty of cafes and ice cream spots. If you’re into photography, basically every corner has a cute street, harbor view or colonial-style building perfect for the ‘Gram.

**Hiking and Outdoor Stuff**  
Camden Hills State Park is the big draw if you like hiking. There are trails for every level:

* **Mount Battie:** Short but steep (about 1.5 miles up), with insane panoramic views of the harbor and Penobscot Bay. Go at sunset if you want the best lighting for photos.  
* **Maiden Cliff:** A shorter trail with stunning coastal views, perfect if you just want a quick stroll and a lookout.  
* **Other Camden Hills trails:** There’s something for everyone, from forest walks to challenging climbs. The park itself is huge, and you can spend half a day exploring without repeating the same scenery.  

Pro tip: Pack water, sunscreen and wear sturdy shoes. Even the easy trails have uneven rocks and roots.

**Season and Timing**  
I went in late September and honestly, that was perfect. The weather was mild, the foliage was starting to turn and the crowds were way smaller than summer. Summer (July–August) is busier and everything is more expensive but you’ll get the full festival plus harbor vibe. Spring is beautiful with flowers and fewer people. Winter is quiet and a lot of shops and restaurants close, so I’d only do winter if you really want a super peaceful, off-season experience.

**Places to Stay**  
Camden has options for all budgets:

* **Airbnbs:** Cozy cottages, harbor-view apartments and even hilltop homes with amazing views. Some have fireplaces or hot tubs if you’re splurging.  
* **Boutique inns:** Small, charming hotels in or near downtown. Perfect if you want something with character but not too fancy.  
* **Campgrounds:** Camden Hills State Park has camping sites if you want to be closer to nature. Highly recommend reserving in advance during peak season.  
* **Glamping:** AutoCamp has fancy Airstream trailers nearby. They’re comfy, modern and you still get the outdoorsy feel.  

**Food and Coffee**  
Food in Camden is great. Nothing fancy but everything has a local twist:

* **Natalie’s:** Classic Maine lobster rolls and seafood, you’re on the coast, you have to.  
* **Long Grain:** Asian fusion dishes with seasonal ingredients, really tasty.  
* **Hartstone Inn Restaurant:** Seasonal menu with local flavors, nice for a casual dinner.  
* **Camden Deli:** Great breakfast or lunch before hiking or exploring the harbor.  

Basically, there are a bunch of small spots you can wander into and trust you’ll get something good.

**Extra Tips and Things I Learned**

1. **Parking:** Downtown spots fill up fast in summer and on weekends. There are public lots but walking from your hotel or Airbnb is often easier.  
2. **Harbor Cruises:** If you like sailing or just want to see the coast from the water, there are multiple options for day trips or sunset cruises. Worth it.  
3. **Photography:** Every season is photogenic, but fall plus early spring give you foliage or flowers for extra Instagram-worthy shots.  
4. **Crowds:** Summer gets busy but it never feels overwhelming like Bar Harbor can. Off-season, you’ll have trails almost to yourself.  
5. **Local Wildlife:** If you’re into birdwatching or coastal critters, keep your eyes open along the harbor and in the hills.  

**Bottom Line**  
Camden, Maine is one of those places that feels like a 'perfect New England postcard,' but it’s actually lived-in, charming and fun. You get scenic harbors, easy access to hikes, cute downtown streets and fresh seafood all in one spot. It’s small enough to feel relaxing but big enough that you won’t run out of things to do for a couple of days.",1,1768970504.0,travelrecos,0,1.0,False

**Ledda 18 Vanilla Nera** 90% 50ml - **$50** (Beautiful vanilla that is not gooey sticky sweet - very dry and resinous, 100% masc-appropriate)

visit a real Turkish bath (hamam) — I’ve heard it’s something next level and want to try the authentic experience

try proper döner and the famous Turkish ice cream (the one everyone talks about 😄)

explore real places, not tourist traps

understand local prices, transport, and daily life

buy authentic souvenirs to take home

Also, if you’re interested, you can practice English with me while we hang out — casual conversations, no pressure.

There's a certain magic in the first cup of the day, isn't there? The gentle steam curling upwards, the rich aroma filling your kitchen – it’s a daily ritual that sets the tone. But if you're looking for an American coffee experience that truly awakens your senses, it’s less about the country of origin and more about the journey from seed to cup.

At Intelligentsia Coffee, we believe the ""American coffee bean"" concept is best represented by how we treat exceptional beans, wherever they're grown. We pioneered **Direct Trade**, forging deep, transparent relationships with farmers across the globe. This isn't just about buying coffee; it’s about investing in quality, sustainability, and ensuring farmers are compensated handsomely for their craft, far exceeding typical Fair Trade standards. Our commitment means we select only the finest cherries, meticulously processed to unlock their full potential.

What truly elevates your experience is our **Roast-to-Order** model. Your coffee isn't sitting on a shelf waiting to be discovered. Instead, it’s roasted precisely for you the moment you place your order, then shipped immediately. This ensures that when it reaches your doorstep, it’s at its absolute peak of freshness and flavor. Forget stale beans; embrace coffee that sings.

Why choose Intelligentsia?

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Roasted specifically for you, guaranteeing a vibrant, aromatic brew.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1qio7d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qio7d4/7_gut_instincts_you_should_never_ignore_the/,7 Gut Instincts You Should Never Ignore: The Science Of Why Your Body Knows First,"Your gut has been screaming at you for months, maybe years. You keep pushing it down, rationalizing it away, convincing yourself you're overthinking. I used to do the same thing until I realized something wild: that uncomfortable feeling isn't anxiety, it's intelligence. Your body processes information way faster than your conscious mind, picking up on micro-patterns your brain hasn't caught up to yet.

After diving deep into neuroscience research, psychology podcasts, and books from people who actually study this stuff (not self-help gurus), I compiled the gut feelings that are almost never wrong. These aren't vague ""follow your heart"" platitudes. These are biological alarm systems that evolved over millennia to keep you alive and thriving.

\*\*The ""something's off about this person"" instinct.\*\* You meet someone new, they seem fine on paper, but something feels weird. Maybe it's how they talk about others, or the way they shift blame, or just an energy you can't name. Trust that. Gavin de Becker's book ""[The Gift of Fear](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Fear-Survival-Signals-Violence/dp/0440226198)"" is insanely good on this topic. He's a security specialist who's advised presidents and Hollywood elites, and his entire premise is that your unconscious mind spots danger signals your conscious mind dismisses. He breaks down how ignoring gut feelings about people leads to everything from toxic relationships to actual violence. The book fundamentally changed how I evaluate people, especially in those early interactions where you're trying to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Your subconscious is reading microexpressions, inconsistencies in stories, and behavioral patterns you're not consciously tracking. Listen to it.

\*\*The ""I need to leave this job"" feeling that won't go away.\*\* Not the Monday blues or post-vacation dread, but that deep, persistent sense that you're wasting your life. When you feel it in your body, like actual heaviness, that's your system telling you something's misaligned. I kept ignoring mine because the salary was decent and I didn't have another offer lined up. Worst decision. Your gut knows when an environment is slowly killing your spirit before your resume does. The podcast ""We [Can Do Hard Things](https://www.amazon.com/We-Can-Hard-Things-Questions/dp/0593977645)"" with Glennon Doyle had an episode about knowing when to quit things, and she talks about how we're conditioned to override our internal compass with external logic. Sometimes the most rational thing is listening to what feels irrational.

\*\*The ""this relationship isn't right"" instinct you keep silencing.\*\* You love them, they're good to you, but something fundamental feels wrong. Maybe you can't picture a future together, or you notice yourself shrinking parts of yourself to fit. That discomfort isn't commitment phobia, it's clarity. Esther Perel, the relationship therapist everyone quotes, talks about this in her work constantly. Her book ""[Mating in Captivity](https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence/dp/0060753641)"" and her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" both explore how we gaslight ourselves in relationships. We convince ourselves we're being too picky or expecting too much when really we're just incompatible with someone. Your gut recognizes incompatibility long before your heart wants to admit it.

\*\*The physical ""I need to prioritize my health"" alarm.\*\* That exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix. That brain fog that coffee doesn't clear. The weird ache that keeps coming back. Your body doesn't send gentle suggestions, it sends increasingly loud warnings. And we've become experts at medicating symptoms instead of addressing causes. Dr. Gabor Maté's work on the body-mind connection is eye-opening here. His book ""When the Body Says No"" explores how suppressing emotions and ignoring stress signals manifests as physical illness. Your gut feeling that something's wrong with your health deserves the same urgency as a check engine light.

\*\*The ""I shouldn't share this with them"" protective instinct.\*\* You're about to tell someone something personal and you get that pause, that slight contraction. But you override it because you want to trust them or you think you're being paranoid. Then two weeks later your business is everywhere. Your gut is pattern-matching based on data you haven't consciously analyzed yet. Tiny breaches of confidence, the way they talk about others, how they react to boundaries. Your instinct caught it all.

\*\*The ""this opportunity feels wrong"" sense despite external pressure.\*\* Everyone's telling you to take the job, accept the offer, make the move. On paper it's perfect. But something inside you is pulling back. That resistance isn't fear of success or self-sabotage like people love to diagnose. Sometimes it's wisdom. Malcolm Gladwell's ""Blink"" explores thin-slicing, how our unconscious mind makes sophisticated judgments in milliseconds. He shares stories of art experts who instantly knew a sculpture was fake despite scientific testing saying otherwise. Their gut was processing information their conscious mind couldn't articulate. Same applies to opportunities. Your gut might be picking up on red flags your optimism is painting over.

\*\*The ""I need to make a change NOW"" urgency that won't shut up.\*\* Not impulsive, but insistent. That feeling that if you don't act soon, you'll look back with massive regret. This one's scary because it often requires blowing up something stable. But your internal system knows when you're running out of time on something important, whether that's fertility, caring for aging parents, pursuing a dream, or leaving a situation that's hardening you into someone you don't want to be.

Speaking of resources that actually help you decode these internal signals, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) has been useful for going deeper into this stuff. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alums and Google experts that pulls from psychology research, neuroscience books, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can ask it to build a learning plan around something specific like ""understanding my gut instincts better"" or ""learning to trust my intuition in relationships,"" and it generates podcasts from sources like the books mentioned here plus research papers and expert talks. The depth is customizable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The app connects dots between different concepts in ways that make complex psychology actually stick.

The difference between anxiety and intuition is this: anxiety spirals and creates chaos in your thinking. Intuition is quiet, consistent, and usually comes with a sense of knowing even when you can't explain why. Your gut isn't trying to ruin your life, it's trying to save it. The real tragedy isn't trusting your instinct and being wrong. It's ignoring your instinct, being right, and having to live with that.",1,1768969892.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False
1qio6su,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qio6su/i_feel_so_sad_by_the_way_my_ex_is_treating_me/,I feel so sad by the way my ex is treating me,"My ex and I were on again and off again for the last 2.5 years. Every time it felt like it could be serious for a fleeting movement, he broke it off.

Most recently we actually tried dating last summer. Sort of. In that I was planning all the dates and bringing him into my life and he wasn’t doing that for me. When he realized what I was doing, he broke it off, but said he still liked me. He said he would tell me if he made a mistake. 

We broke up and I went to his birthday party. He came to my birthday party. He gave me an escape room as a birthday present. We had dinner together. We met up at an event together. He took care of my cat during the holidays. And then we did the escape room together and left again for the Christmas holidays.

During the Christmas holidays we texted a little bit. He was so warm with me. I felt so happy. I had been gutted this whole time. When we came back to the same city he said he had a present for me. So we met for coffee.

During the coffee it started off amazing. We were laughing and vibing even after he spilled my drink on me. We talked about our trips, our families, our jobs. He had his arm around me. Then he asked me how I was feeling.

I said I had missed him and it’s been hard. That I thought about him a lot. I said I was confused as he originally told me he broke up because he didn’t like me, but then he later said that wasn’t true. I was confused on where the incompatibility was then. He said he thought about me too. But not as much. He said he was seeing someone else but it wasn’t going to work out with her. I asked why. Then he said because he just didn’t see it. I asked why it didn’t work with me. He said he didn’t know. I said he never tried. He admitted he had a commitment issue. This was new. I said I knew that based on the actions of our relationship and he agreed. Then I said well I guess that’s incompatibility. I asked him if there was anything I could’ve done better. He said no. But he was trying to run away and I was so stressed about that. The conversation was a disaster. And now I’m so sad it ended like this.

What are his feelings towards me? He was mad at the moment because he hit his limit. He said that. I didn’t honor that—I wanted to keep discussing. That’s where it ended in anger. I asked for a block. I said he shouldn’t have asked the question if he didn’t want to hear the answers. He said I could do whatever I want and he doesn’t owe me anything at all. He is not responsible for my emotions from the breakup and he is not responsible in supporting me. I said I wasn’t asking for that, but he cut me off and got into his car. And then we left. And then I sent the texts.

I love him. I loved the idea of us. I know he wasn’t perfect but he felt perfect for me in many ways. I’m sure there will be more, but this is hurts me so so much. I texted him saying i was sorry that i pretended we could be friends and I asked him to block me. I also thanked him for the memories we had together. He has not responded to me. He doesn’t have the emotional capacity. But I’m so hurt right now. ",1,1768969848.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I even gave her a flower the first time, which made her smile, but she said she couldn’t take it home because of family reasons. During the movie meet, she talked about her life, her job, and even some bad experiences. She seemed comfortable and kept the conversation going, but never got openly flirty.

""Shut it down now!"" Holoron yelled out the instruction as he ran across the room. His hand extended, finger pointed at the operator sitting across from the flickering CRT display.

He hurdled a desk but stumbled as a pocket caught an edge.

""Now! Get it offline!"" He screamed this as he jerked himself forward, tearing the seat of his pants as he did.

The operator, Sergeant Killion, stared up at the advancing civilian as he approached.

To him, it was some civilian in a tie who had somehow broken into the control room and was yelling incomprehensible nonsense.

""What?"" Killion started and stood up with a smooth uncoiling of his lanky body.

His uniform was creased and stained with the residue of the stressful hours spent monitoring the remote site.

""Do what now? Who the fuck are you?"" He reached for his holstered revolver and held up a hand, palm raised to stop the intruder.

That was when James approaching from the opposite timeline slammed into Holoron and tackled him to the cross hatched, tiled floor.

They rolled about, struggling. 

The two were identical with only a few details to set them apart.

Whereas Holoron wore a gray two piece off the rack suit, James was in an immaculately tailored black limousine driver's uniform.

Both were blonde.

Both had skin the color of a deep east African coffee.

But where Holoron spoke in English, James spoke in some incomprehensible tongue.

It was not terrestrial.

Their struggles were violent and they smashed the desk to kindling, their feet kicking divots into the tiled floor.

Both were cursing. Evident in their expressions and Holoron's shouted imprecations and James's gasped but unintelligible responses.

James got the upper hand and straddled Holoron, choking him with the cheap cotton tie that had come with the suit.

""The fuck are you two doing here? Who the hell are you?"" Sergeant Killion had dragged his revolver free and fired a shot at the two struggling men.

The shot ricocheted off the floor, whining up into the ceiling of the room.

It got their attention and Killion pointed his weapon in a tight two-handed grip.

He gestured at them, both sets of eyes now fixed on the service weapon.

""Get the hell up."" Killion produced a whistle and began to blow on it.

In seconds, there was a thunder of footsteps as a squad of Rapid Reaction marines rushed into the room, their rifles held at the ready.

Just then, both Holoron and James disappeared.

Not immediately, but something more like a slow phase shift. 

They became translucent, still holding on to each other in frozen combat, still staring at Killion and his revolver.

The stunned marines hesitated, blinked. But Killion fired.

The bullet slammed into the duo, but then just hung there, spinning. Then it dropped to the floor as the men faded completely from view.

As the bullet plinked off the floor, the CRT suddenly glowed and exploded inwards. The screen shattered in and a howling vortex appeared.

Then as suddenly as it had started, it ended.

Remaining on the floor where the men had been, two tarnished badges.

One with an embossed anchor. It said Admiral Holoron. The other a simple metal rectangle. Commodore James.

Killion looked at the marines who stared back with expressions of disbelief.

He knelt and picked up the badges. Turning them over, both had short inscriptions in flowing text.

One in English. ""You cannot cage me. Next time, I'll get you. Bastard.""

The other in some incomprehensible text, but as he looked at it, it flowed. Reformed. Then in English. ""I got out. So can he.""

Then Killion turned to look at the CRT. His frown creased his face into an ugly crush of fear and anger. ""They got out? Shit.""
