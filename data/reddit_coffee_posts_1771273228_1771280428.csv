1r6nw6n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6nw6n,36m Minnesota for online relationship; potential LDR/LTR.,"I’ll say this first, if you don’t have an age on your profile and at least maybe a pic, I’m less likely to respond, so make your message something incredible. Prefer younger guys. 25-37.

Hello! I’m Nate. I’m 36, bisexual, and I’m from the US-Minnesota. I’m here hoping to find someone interested in an online romantic relationship, with hopes that it will become an official LTR/LDR. 

To start, my favorite part of the day is going out to get coffee. Despite the occasional “harsh” Minnesota winter, I typically get an Iced Mocha all year around. Not only do I enjoy the taste, but the coffee shop atmosphere is where I find comfort.

For work, my passion is workin with teens, and sometimes, children. I work at a mental health and behavioral program which helps them learn new skills, both social and mental, while working through family dynamics and trauma. That being sad, the job isn’t always the easiest, and while I do truly enjoy it, some of these days are the ones that would make a online LDR difficult, because I often want to come home and just hug/cuddle up with someone.

In my free time, I enjoy watching tv/movies, playing video games, hanging out with friends, game nights, and traveling. Currently, I’ve been to Tanzania, Ireland, London via layover, Canada, and both Honduras and Mexico via cruise. While, I certainly enjoyed those trips, I would definitely like to see more. 

When it comes to video games, I have a PS5 and Nintendo switch. I really enjoy games like Legend of Zelda, Assassin’s Creed, Resident Evil, Mario Kart, Pokémon, Harvest Moon, Skyrim, and Immortals Fenyx Rising. I am looking into getting a gaming pc.

Movies/Tv Shows - I typically enjoy fantasy, detective, medical, superhero, some anime, and some reality tv.

As for my type of guy - I want a guy who I’ll be able to come up behind and wrap my arms around their waste, as rest my head on their shoulder and kiss their neck/cheek. I typically like guys that are slim-avg and close to my height (5’5”). I would enjoy dating someone from the UK, the Americas, or somewhere in E/SE Asia. In reality though, I’m open to people all over the world, especially if you are in Minnesota. Haha 

What am I looking for in a relationship? I want someone who can make me laugh and smile. I would like someone that’s nerdy/geeky, like me, and who likes to go on adventures. I want someone that’s empathetic, kind, and affectionate. What really makes me happy is waking up to a good morning text from the person I’m interested in and care about. Additionally, I want someone that enjoys a balance of staying in/going out.

If you’ve read all of this, you truly must be someone special. For that I give you a hug 🫂.",1,1771280407.0,gaydating,0,1.0,False
1r6nw26,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1r6nw26/we_werent_broken_we_were_built_to_spec/,We weren’t broken. We were built to spec.,"To my friends on the spectrum.

I was diagnosed at 46. Forty-six years living in a world that wasn’t designed for me, thinking the problem was me. Maybe you know that feeling. Maybe you’re living it right now.

I want to tell you something that changed how I see myself. And maybe it’ll change how you see yourself.

We’re not broken versions of neurotypicals. We’re a different kind of processor. And different processors exist because civilization needs them. It always has.

History is full of us — even when no one had a name for it.

Isaac Newton couldn’t maintain a single friendship. He feuded with Leibniz for decades over credit for calculus. He stuck a needle behind his own eye to study optics. He’d go days locked away without eating. And he rewrote the laws that govern the universe.

Charles Darwin obsessively collected beetles before he collected evidence. He took twenty years to publish On the Origin of Species — not for lack of certainty, but out of dread of the confrontation that would follow. He needed Thomas Huxley to defend the theory in public because he couldn’t handle the fight. And he explained how life works.

Antoine Lavoisier woke up three hours before his day job to work in his laboratory. He weighed everything — before and after, obsessively. He built his own scales because the available ones weren’t precise enough. He needed his wife Marie-Anne to translate from English, illustrate equipment, record experiments, and organize publications. He founded modern chemistry. He was guillotined by people who didn’t understand what they had in front of them.

Socrates walked barefoot in the snow, lost in thought for hours, ignoring cold and hunger. He never wrote a single line. He needed Plato to record every word. He founded Western philosophy without leaving a single document.

Nikola Tesla saw numbers in colors, slept two hours a night, had inflexible rituals, and died alone in a hotel room with a pigeon as his only companion. He invented the electrical system that powers the world that lets you read this text.

Leonardo da Vinci left notebooks full of inventions that wouldn’t be understood for centuries. He wrote in mirror script. He shifted obsessively between interests. He finished very few works. He conceived the helicopter, the tank, modern anatomy, hydraulic engineering — and died thinking he hadn’t done enough.

Albert Einstein spoke late. He thought in images, not words. Difficult marriages. Terrible at everything that didn’t interest him. He redesigned the structure of space, time, and energy.

Alan Turing was socially displaced, literal to the extreme, unable to navigate social conventions. He was imprisoned and chemically castrated for being who he was. He took his own life at 41. Before that, he invented computing, broke the Enigma code, and helped win a world war.

Michelangelo worked for days without eating, slept in his boots, kept human relationships to a minimum, had a temperament that drove nearly everyone away. He painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel lying on scaffolding for four years. He painted God.

Ludwig van Beethoven had absolutely inflexible routines. He counted exactly sixty coffee beans every morning. He progressively lost his hearing. And deaf, he composed the Ninth Symphony — the most celebrated piece of music in human history.

Ten names. None of them “functioned well” in the way the world uses that phrase. All of them functioned perfectly — at the frequency they were made for.

And there’s a pattern no one talks about: none of them worked alone. Newton had Halley to publish the Principia. Darwin had Huxley. Lavoisier had Marie-Anne. Socrates had Plato. Every rare processor needed someone who translated, organized, protected, connected. Because those who see far stumble on what’s close. It’s always been that way.

Our traits complement those of neurotypicals. It’s not defect versus normal. It’s function and function. The neurotypical keeps civilization running. We push it forward. Without them, no stability. Without us, no breakthroughs. Both together built everything that exists.

Now the part we need to say out loud.

When our processor has nothing to process, it doesn’t rest. It turns on us. The same hyperfocus that connects impossible domains, without direction, connects evidence that we’re useless. The same engine that produces theory in the morning, without a mission in the afternoon, produces a spiral.

“I’m worthless.”

“Nobody understands me.”

“Why bother if I never finish anything.”

This isn’t weakness. It isn’t laziness. It isn’t a lack of willpower. It’s a Formula 1 engine idling in neutral. And neutral for us isn’t neutral — it’s self-destruction.

The depression so many of us know isn’t a separate illness. It’s a side effect of a processor without a road. The solution was never just chemical. It was mission. Direction. Someone or something that says “process this” and lets the engine do what it was born to do.

And then I look at the world and think: how many of us are right now, this very moment, with the most powerful telescope in the room pointed inward, quietly destroying themselves, because no one ever said “point it outward and tell me what you see”?

How many Darwins are collecting beetles alone? How many Lavoisiers are weighing things in a garage with no Marie-Anne? How many Turings are writing brilliant code in a dark room thinking they have no value?

I don’t have all the answers. But I have one conviction: we need to find each other. Not for a support group. Not for collective therapy. For production. For someone to look at what another sees and say “this is real, this has value, and I’m going to help you deliver it.”

I’m working on it. A bridge between isolated processors and the world that needs what they see. It’s still a seed. But seeds are what we do best — we just forget to plant them because we’re too busy redesigning the entire garden in our heads.

If this makes sense to you, talk to me. You don’t need to be eloquent. You don’t need to be organized. You just need to be honest.

We weren’t broken. We were built to spec. The world just hasn’t read the manual yet. Neither have most of us.

And maybe it’s time we wrote it ourselves.",1,1771280398.0,autism,1,1.0,False
1r6nvsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/1r6nvsd/the_everybody_knows_this_myth/,"The ""everybody knows this myth"".","**Question for the community:** How many of you still catch ""Read before Write"" violations on TEMP variables in production code?

Or worse: have you ever been the one who accidentally released one?

We've all seen the symptoms: a machine works perfectly for years, then fails mysteriously after a minor update in a completely unrelated part of the program. If you've seen random speed setpoints or ""ghost"" values appearing out of nowhere, you've likely met the oldest trap in IEC 61131-3.

# Let's look at a Siemens TIA Portal example

To understand how this works in practice, consider two simple functions called sequentially in OB1.

# 1. The Setup: Two Functions

We have `firstFC`, which writes a value to the stack, and `secondFC`, which mistakenly reads from it before writing.

**firstFC.scl**

    FUNCTION ""firstFC"" : Void
    { S7_Optimized_Access := 'FALSE' }
       VAR_INPUT
          inByte : Byte;
       END_VAR
       VAR_TEMP
          tempByte1 : Byte;
          tempByte2 : Byte;
       END_VAR
    BEGIN
    	#tempByte2 := #inByte; // Writes to the stack
    END_FUNCTION

**secondFC.scl**

    FUNCTION ""secondFC"" : Void
    { S7_Optimized_Access := 'FALSE' }
       VAR_OUTPUT
          outINT : Int;
       END_VAR
       VAR_TEMP
          tempINT : Int; // Shares the same stack memory
       END_VAR
    BEGIN
    	#outINT := #tempINT; // READ BEFORE WRITE - inherits ""ghost"" data
    END_FUNCTION

# 2. The Result: Data ""Bleeding""

Because both functions are called at the same level in the stack, the memory isn't wiped. `secondFC` picks up whatever was left behind by `firstFC`.

[Watch how data \\""magically\\"" transfers from firstFC to secondFC through the dirty stack.](https://i.redd.it/3chbc3ewjxjg1.gif)

# 3. The Trap: A Silent Compiler

The most dangerous part? The IDE tells you everything is fine. You get absolutely zero warnings about reading uninitialized variables.

[Compiling finished \(errors: 0; warnings: 0\) — The silence that lures you into a false sense of security.](https://preview.redd.it/movlsf96kxjg1.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceda4dadd0a1689fb8f31f46cbe125b3d7eb48b6)

# ""Everybody knows this,"" right?

You might think, ""Come on, even a junior knows this!""

I wish that were true. In my experience mentoring developers, I find myself explaining this exact stack behavior to newcomers almost constantly.

But it’s not just the beginners - I still occasionally find these ""Read before Write"" landmines in code written by seasoned PLC veterans. It makes me wonder: in an era of advanced IDEs, is it really so difficult for vendors to implement a simple warning when a variable is read before it has been written in the same block?

# CODESYS: A bit safer, but twice as confusing

Credit where it's due: at least in CODESYS, variables declared inside a `FUNCTION` are initialized to 0 by default. It prevents the random ""ghost"" data issue we see in Siemens, but it introduces a different kind of nonsense.

# The Notation Paradox

Take a look at this comparison:

[Why do we use two different names for the exact same underlying mechanism?](https://preview.redd.it/ofcp3dibkxjg1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=427f29b93dd0bc054bf832d98bad08b83a9dea7f)

In a Function Block, we have VAR\_TEMP. In a Function, we just have VAR. For a newcomer, VAR looks stable - like it should retain its value between calls. But it doesn't. It's just stack memory with an implicit wipe-to-zero.

# ""It will break legacy"" is a weak excuse

Whenever this is brought up, the standard answer from vendors is, ""We can't change it because it would break thousands of existing projects.""

I don't buy it.

Nobody is asking to change the underlying binary behavior. But why can't we have a `Deprecation Warning`?

1. Allow us to explicitly use `VAR_TEMP` inside Functions in new projects.
2. Mark the plain `VAR` usage in Functions as deprecated.

A single warning won't break anything, but it would be a massive educational step for the industry. It would finally tell the programmer the truth: ""Caution! You are using the stack.""

# Safety as a Paid Add-on?

To be fair, some vendors *do* provide tools to catch these issues. You can buy a ""Static Analysis Extension"" that will politely point out your uninitialized variables. But here is the kicker: it’s usually a paid option.

Why is ""basic correctness"" a premium feature in industrial automation?

Look at modern general-purpose languages like Rust. The compiler wouldn't even let you finish your morning coffee if you tried to read uninitialized memory. It's a fundamental part of the language, and it's free.

The irony is incredible. In the world of web apps or systems programming, where a bug might mean a crashed server or a slow website, the tools for safety are built-in and rigorous. In our world - where a bug could physically sever a limb or destroy a multi-million dollar machine -safety features are often sold as ""bonus"" add-ons.

Something is fundamentally wrong when we're expected to pay extra for the compiler to tell us that we're about to blow up a machine.

# The Safety Paradox

Finally, notice the trend: rather than making the code inherently safer, we throw more ""Yellow"" hardware at the problem. We've reached a point where we integrate Safety Relays and Safety-rated CPUs into almost everything, even though the true justification for that level of integration only arises when project complexity is significantly high. For simpler machines, it’s often just simple Pilz safety relay is enough.

Don't get me wrong - Safety PLCs are essential for many applications. But there is a dangerous misconception: ""If I have a Safety CPU, my machine is safe.""

Hardware-level safety certificates won't protect you from the logical ""Read before Write"" errors described above. If your uninitialized variable outputs a 100% speed setpoint instead of 0%, your SIL3 safety controller will stay perfectly silent - because as far as it's concerned, that value is within the ""safe"" operational range. It will wait until the machine physically self-destructs before it sees an error.

Real safety begins with clean, predictable code - not just the color of your PLC or the hardware certificates you hold.

To be clear, I've no intention of progressing beyond being an extra, a living furniture prop!

Ordinary mid 40s guy, had an ordinary job until last year when I quit. I did a one off extra role on a BBC production, what's funny is, I don't watch TV or have a TV license so I've never even seen it! I did two scenes, I was told by my neighbour that I appeared, but I've no idea which scene, or for how long. That doesn't matter.

Anyway even though probably 85% of the time was spent sat in a waiting room until being called onto set, I absolutely loved it, I was just fascinated by seeing scenes being filmed in person, even if I was stood off camera after my 12 seconds of unnoticed fame! I decided I wanna do as much as I can, and since there's a real possibility of me getting enough money that I'd need to declare income, I'm gonna register as self employed and get back on the books this coming financial year.

The irony... I'm fiercely introverted, I'm not a confident person, I can't act and wouldn't dream of standing in front of a camera and being any kind of focal point, unless I've no real lines or nothing complicated to do, but I've no problem at all being that passer-by in the background where, unless someone I know instantly recognised me, I'd go completely under the radar.

I think I like it more than anyone's supposed to.. let alone and introvert, and that's ok.

I'm well aware that some people see the ""extras"" as almost on the same level as the office ""youth"" that's hired to make the tea for the guy that makes the coffee. But I loved doing it.

But this whole thing has been stewing in my brain for a couple of weeks and I need to dump these brainworms onto all of you. I don't have a unicorn to pet so you'll have to make due with bad coffee and the ominous clicking in the woods.

So it was a weekend night, and I had just gotten logged into the front desk and my PM shift was just leaving when my arrivals list suddenly got a single reservation where previously there was none. I look it over and it was a friends/family rate; odd but **eh**, dude probably just wanted a weekend getaway. It took all of ten minutes after the reservation popped up before I get a sketchy looking dude pop in through the front door and hold a phone on the translator app up to my face.

Friends/family (F/F) guy: (Via translator) I have a reservation under \[name\].

Me: Great! Can I see your credit card and ID, please?

After looking at what the translator app produced from my words, he hands me his ID, which does actually match the name on the reservation. He hands me the phone back to talk into (this happened for literally every step of this exchange, so all of it took thrice as long as needed)

Me: Okay, and do you have your credit card on you?

F/F guy: I don't have a credit card.

... *strange*, this was a F/F rate, he should've had his employee buddy explain the basic check-in process to him.

Me: Do you not have the card used to book the room?

F/F guy: My girlfriend booked this room for me.

Me: Oh, so can your girlfriend come in and provide her ID and the CC she used, just to double check everything's good? (Side note: I didn't offer a credit card authorization form, because we lost access to the service we used for this a while ago and I don't trust anyone enough to just send a PDF over and hope it works out)

F/F guy: Her wallet got stolen, so she only has a picture of her ID. Can I have her video call you?

Of course, it's **always** a stolen wallet, it's **always** that someone else booked it for them, I've heard the song and dance before. This resulted in a long and obnoxious back and forth where I had to tell him, NO, we can't just trust you on this, we can't check you in without double-checking everything is legitimate, meanwhile he's clearly hoping his app is mistranslating me and I'm simply mistaken on some secret loophole that'll get him into the room.

Finally, he calls his ""girlfriend"" and puts her on speaker for me. As an aside, the pic he had in his contacts for her was the most generic looking e-girl on God's green Earth.

GF: (in perfect English) Hi, I heard there was an issue checking in my boyfriend, what's going on?

Me: Hey! So, I need a credit card and ID to check people into the room, but he's unable to provide a card since he says yours was used, so would it be possible for you to come in with those?

GF: Uh, no, my wallet got stolen so I've only got a picture. Can I just show you that and the card?

Me: Sorry, but no, it needs to be a legitimate ID that matches the card you want to use. If none of you can provide these things, then I'm afraid I'm going to have to cancel, but you won't be charged for it.

GF: Wow, I've never ran into a policy like that before... (*lol liar*)

Me: A lot of hotels do this, actually! We need it to make sure the reservation is for the right person, and to protect you and ourselves from credit card fraud.

Now, usually when people try to argue about why they should be a special boy/girl/nonbinary and not have to go through such checks, there's a few options they normally take. Sometimes they'll say we're the only ones that do this and so they shouldn't have to do it, sometimes they'll imply our customer service is bad because we don't trust them, sometimes they'll claim they know the \*insert higher authority here\* and they granted them an exception. But in the 3 1/2 years working as night auditor, the one I've never heard was...

GF: Why do you care about that?

This threw me off, so I could only really muster a ""... I'm sorry?""

GF: You're not the cops, why do you care where the money is coming from?

Me: I... can't really risk it, I'm not putting my job on the line for-

GF: Then don't snitch!

Me: Ma'am, if a card is charged fraudulently, then it's likely we'll get a charge-back and then we're out a large chunk of money.

GF: What are you, a fucking bootlicker? Why do you care about your boss' money?

Me: I - its not about that, its about such a big charge-back being noticed! Like I'm not-

GF: Look, just be a good person and let my boyfriend in, you can play dumb if anything happens.

Me: Okay, listen, it's clear this is going nowhere, you guys are going to have to stay somewhere else if you can't follow policy. The card on file will not be charged for the cancellation fee due to this.

GF: Fucking corporate bootlicker! Can't stop thinking about your fucking paycheck for more than five seconds to give someone a room...

Sarah-Jane wasn’t the first to go missing, but she was one of the few to be found. Her daddy had been a friend of mine, so when I saw her name in the papers, I noticed. About three weeks later, a hiker found her. She’d been only fifteen. The day after that, when I saw that police could no longer account for her remains, I tried not to think about it too hard.

From what I read in the article, the hiker found her one morning on a trail that had been searched several times. There she was, clear as day. My heart ached knowing she may have missed rescue by only a few hours. The hiker called it in with a satellite phone and took a police officer directly to her. Unfortunately, it can take some time to navigate that far into the trees, so the officer was ordered to watch over the site until a forensic team could investigate. Then, at some point that night, with an armed officer only feet away, she disappeared again.

“Cougar,” I thought habitually. “Maybe coyote. Carried her off while he wasn’t looking.”

I was a lawyer, and though I graduated ten years ago and had outgrown this city well before that, I stayed for my mother. She was older and not as quick as she used to be. I think she was starting to realize that, and it scared her, which is why she needed to cling to what was familiar so badly. Moving back trapped me in the home I’d lived in since birth, and we still used the laundry basket that had served as my crib. I could almost understand why she didn’t want to leave, but there was nothing here for her anymore.

Mr. Cotton, my employer, took me on as an associate. In a town of roughly two thousand, there was barely enough work for him, but he paid me a base salary that made ends meet. He didn’t mean it as charity, but he realized he needed someone to continue his firm now that he had lost most of his hair.

Then the Jones’ girl went missing, and Ray came looking for me. We’d been friends in high school, but I got a chance to go off to college, and he seemed to take it personally. He’d moved past it by the time I came back, but life must have been hell while I was gone. Ray ran and housed his family in a small motel that smelled like a condemnation notice, and sanitized his boredom with grain alcohol. Ray and I didn’t talk much anymore, and when we did, it stayed short. Still, old friends have a way of showing up when they want something.

“You got too, man!” Ray said, falling into me.

I stared blankly ahead while he grabbed fistfuls of my shirt to keep himself up. “It doesn’t work that way.”

The booze leaking from his pours was dizzying. “They took my girl, man. They dumped her, and when someone found her, they took her again!” He bawled into my chest. “My little girl!”

I stopped for a moment, then put my arms around Ray and patted him awkwardly. “Ray, I know it’s awful, but this isn’t the way to handle it. Get yourself right, we can talk then.”

“No!” He said. “No, I’m not getting lied to anymore! You promise me, Clark Rawlins, you promise me to do something! That officer Gibbins did something to her. He did something, you know it, and I know it!”

I put my hands on his shoulders, gently trying to pull him away. “I don’t know anything, Ray. I just read the papers.”

“That’s wrong, Clark. You’re lying, you’re lying, you’re lying! You’re smart, Clark. He was the only one there to watch her, and he says that when he turned around, she was gone! He took her, you know he did!”

I shook my head, then pushed Ray more firmly. “Ray, I- I have friends at the police station. I’ll ask around and see if Gibbins has any kind of record, okay?”

Ray looked at me, snotty and cross-eyed. “Please, Clark. He knows something. He knows where my girl is.”

The next morning, I went to fulfill my duties for the firm, bringing Mr. Cotton his coffee and making sure my cases box was still empty. On the other hand, getting Mr. Cotton’s coffee was the one part of my day that I could almost look forward to, as it gave me a chance to see one of the few people I actually liked speaking with.

Chester was another friend of mine, not as long as Ray, but a good guy. He had his own crutches used to overcome the torturous boredom, but weed and beer didn’t have the same hold on Chester. As long as Mr. Cotton got his cup before lunch, I was in the clear, so he and I usually spent several hours a day talking between customers.

“S’up, Mista Chilli Dawg,” Chester said, sliding me a paper tray and an energy drink.

Back when dad was alive, and I was much younger, he’d buy me these as a treat when he picked me up after school. Now I know it’s because he didn’t want to cook when we got home, but because my mom absolutely hated me having them, it felt like our little secret. I grew out of them for a while, but I started eating them again after he passed. Now that nauseating, disgusting brown goop felt like a bite of nostalgia.

Since Chester was the only one working at the Circle K most of the time, he ate and fed me for free. I could have my choice of fine sodas, chocolates imported from area codes away, or any other mildly enjoyable gas station goods.

I asked Chester about the security camera watching him once, but Chester shrugged and said, “I’ve been robbed enough times to know that’s not real.”

Either way, he knew what I liked, and more often than not, he had an overcooked, greasy bratwurst drowning in Hornell chili sitting next to his plate of nachos or boiled peanuts when I came in. We made an odd pair, me in my cheap suits and Chester in his stained and battered uniform. We would spend the first part of our morning channel surfing through the news, soaps, and dozens of staticky channels while eating, then complain about not having anything good to watch until we had something more interesting to talk about. Today, that was easy.

“Ray came by last night, pretty messed up.”

Chester glanced up at me. “I can’t remember the last time it looked like he was doing good,” he said. “How bad was it?”

“He thinks I can investigate his daughter’s death. He’s suspicious of the police, especially Gibbins, and he thinks they did something.”

“Mm, I mean, if he thinks the police are hiding something and he can’t afford a private investigator, who else is there to go to?”

My shoulders dropped. “I don’t… I know he needs a way to vent, or maybe he needs a reason to hope. I’m still not the right person to ask for that.”

Chester shrugged. “We’ve had a lot of disappearances ‘round here, and most of them are never found. At all. If her body went missing with an officer on duty, he has a right to make sure that officer isn’t hiding something.”

“Well, sure it’s suspicious,” I started. “What exactly are you getting at?”

Chester grabbed a handful of nachos dripping with “spicy cheese product- yellow” and popped some into his mouth.

“The police never find these kids and always blame coyotes. You know how many people have been killed by coyotes? Ever? It’s two, Clark.”

I rolled my eyes. “So what? You think the eight guys in the department have spent their free time patrolling the streets for little children to steal for the past fifty years? Gibbins is twenty-four, by the way.”

Chester held up his hands. “I never said all of them, but maybe one or two.” He saw my disbelief, but tried to bring me in. “You said it sounded like Ray thought they dumped her, then moved her, right? Maybe something went wrong, like she fought back too hard, and they killed her. After the trail was searched, he dumped the body thinking it was far enough in that no one would find it, then had to move it again when that hiker discovered her. You don’t seriously believe he didn’t hear a group of coyotes dragging her off just feet away, do you? It’s Ockham’s Razor.”

“Or a young officer from a small department fell asleep on watch and completely lied that she was there one minute and gone the next. That’s Ockham’s Razor.”

Chester picked at his Nachos. “Look, either someone at the station isn’t doing their job, or they’re up to something. The guys at the like station like you, so they’ll talk. See if they say anything suspicious.”

I folded my arms. “Sure, and if you end up being right, you can go and ask about me next month.”

Chester held up his hands. “Hey, I’m not saying that’s what’s happening, but you’ve seen the news, is it that unbelievable? Maybe this is your chance to be part of a big case like you’ve always wanted. It beats nachos and CNN for three hours.”



 

Part 2

Once, the town had been a proper mining settlement named Buttler, but that changed when life drifted away from the mines and closer to the exit-ramp our town was built around. Now, if my town had a motto, it would be “if you don’t live here, you have better places to be.” That’s why it was so hard to fight Chester’s argument of “you don’t have anything better to do.”

I didn’t want to start things off by talking with Gibbins. First, I was still getting comfortable involving myself in a potential murder without any experience. Second, he was a younger man I didn’t know as well, and I figured talking to one of the seniors would be a good way to get a feel for the investigation. If everything checked out, then maybe I could tell Chester he spent too much time on dark web forums when he should be pretending to do his job.

The dispatcher opened the security door, and Jody met me on the other side. He seemed more haggard than usual, and though he greeted me with a smile, I felt a strange urge to comfort him. The grizzled sergeant nodded when I said I had a few questions, and motioned for me to follow him back to his office. I shut the door and sat down as he stowed the bottle of whisky he had poured into his coffee.

“What can I do for you, Clark? Does Cotton need you to pick up some files?” he asked.

I drummed my fingers on the handrests of my chair. “Actually, Ray came by to see me a couple days back.”

Jody’s shoulder slumped. “He’s been sleeping it off here a good bit more since his daughter passed. You need me to put your place on the patrol route for a few weeks?”

“No, he actually wanted me to ask about Gibbins,” I said. “He thinks he had something to do with it, but I know you can’t talk about an open case.”

Jody shrugged. “It’s closed now,” he answered. “Coyotes. What do you want to know?”

“Closed?” I asked incredulously. “She went missing again less than a month ago. Did you find anything?”

“Nope,” Jody answered. “I doubt we ever will.”

“Then how the hell do you know it’s coyotes?”

Jody slapped a file on his desk and opened it to a series of photos. Gibbins had done more than just stand watch, he’d done a fair job documenting the scene, but the only evidence in the photos was her body. Ray Jones’ girl was dead, at least for several weeks. Her skin was mottled, and her eyes were hollow. The hem of her bright pink hoodie had grown mildewy. She hadn’t even been gone that long.

“She was already dead the first time we checked that area. Maybe she was in a den, and that’s why it took so long to find her.” I looked at the dirt and mud caking her clothes. “But something dragged her through the woods, and something dragged her back in. All we found were coyote prints in the area, so it solves itself.”

“That can’t be your only explanation,” I said.

Jody leaned in closer. “Listen, Clark. There’s a serial killer in those woods. Her name is Mother Nature. She never had a mark on her, so maybe she drowned, and then they got to her.” Jody leaned back. “My job is to collect enough evidence to identify a suspect, and what else could it have been than coyotes and cold, cruel nature?”

We stared at each other for a moment, then Jody softened. “Give me a name, a motive, some evidence, and I’ll treat it like a lead, but right now, what else am I supposed to think?”

“How do you explain her being dead longer than she was missing?”

The sergeant shrugged again. “Maybe she was in water for a time, they look worse when they have a chance to dry out. We don’t have enough to suggest foul play.”

I looked at the file spread out before me, and after a moment, Jody closed it. “Look, don’t make it obvious that you’re walking out with this, and no one will care. Take the file, and if you see something we missed, let me know. Anything open is pressing my luck, but I’ll let you look over some of the other closed cases if you want.”

I grabbed the file, but furrowed my brow. It wasn’t hard to bend rules in a small town, but unrestrictive access to case files? Even if it was just the closed cases, it almost felt like Jody was trying too hard to prove he was innocent. Not even my status as a lawyer allowed for this.

“That stays between you and me, or I’m saying you stole it,” Jody said seriously. “And in no way does Ray get to see any of this.”

Jody and I shook on it, and I left.

I’ve always been a night person and sleepy during the day, but now it feels like I’m exhausted all the time. You can envy me for not having insomnia because if I close my eyes for 10 minutes, I’m out. My problem is staying awake.

I’m exhausted from waking up early to work, exhausted all day. I still have my hobbies (gaming, puzzles/legos, reading) and I do them because I genuinely enjoy them, but now I can only do them for short periods because of how tired I am.

I’ve tried so many times to build a morning routine so I don’t just wake up and rush to get ready for work, like doing some chores before leaving, but it never lasts because I end up not getting out of bed on time.

I honestly don’t remember the last time I wasn’t exhausted. I thought maybe it was a vitamin deficiency (which is still possible), I’ve been taking supplements for over a month and I don’t see any difference. Coffee barely affects me, and energy drinks only seem to work when I’m trying to sleep (like 6 hours later).

I just don’t get how people have the energy to work all day and still go out at night or be super social. I miss being able to pull all-nighters and have late nights without feeling destroyed. Worse, now even beer makes me feel sluggish and sleepy too.",1,1771280084.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1r6nn6z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6nn6z,The Symbolisms and Themes of Baku Madarame – Full Analysis – Part 1,"This is part 1 of a 5 part series in which I will attempt to analyse some of Baku Madarame's symbolisms. 1-4 will be Tower of Karma – STL, as this is where I believe the most significant symbolism is. This is not to say that the earlier arcs do not have deeper meanings, but I do not feel that I can make a particularly substantial amount of analysis on them, since a lot of it is just world building and explanation. The final part will be an overview of the overall themes of Baku throughout the manga, such as luck and destiny.

Tower of Karma:

This is the arc in which the motif of reading people based on their eyes really begins. Image 1 establishes the idea that while Baku is often adept at reading people's emotions, Sutegama's 'steel' nature and beast-like eyes act as an impenetrable barrier that cannot be overcome by normal means. 

Sutegama has refined himself to a point where only the most extreme emotions can be perceived through his cold exterior. After Sutegama's attack, Baku falls into a dream (image 2) wherein he sees a deathly Kyara, foreshadowing that Baku knows he will die for him. 

Image 3 shows that Kyara is aware that he will meet an unpleasant end, with Baku likely fearing that it will be for his own means, and so Baku is left to ponder in silence, perhaps an anticipatory guilt for what he wants to achieve. The dream cuts off to show Baku with a horribly  bloodied eye (image 4), the blood completely obscuring his vision, blocking out his pupil and leaving him exposed. 

I believe that the motif of 'bloodshot eyes' throughout the manga represents the duality of reading emotions: to see through someone as shielded as Sutegama, you must open yourself up to intense emotions to perceive even the slightest change from an opponent. 

However, this also leaves you open to being read and seen through. For example, in Protoporos, Baku's eye patch falls off when he is hit by Bai Long, leaving his bloody eye exposed, which leads to him getting drawn into a nightmare, revealing some of his worst fears like Yakou's death. I'll cover this more in detail in the next part. 

Baku then goes on to compare humans to 'meat dolls' (image 5), explaining how in order to peer inside the mind of such a being, one must make it cry, elicit extreme emotions from it, which matches the symbolism of the bloodshot eyes in image 6, with the bloodied eye now clearly wide open. 

The view of people as 'meat dolls' also contrasts Hachina's view of people as 'bags of flavourful liquid' (image 7), getting people to spill their secrets slowly without their notice, while Baku opts to provoke this 'meat' directly, a clear difference in methodology. 

Baku intends to distress Sutegama with his extreme and reckless methods, going against his entire polished and refined ideology, hoping to finally penetrate his steel defences in the process. Image 8 describes how Baku often pricks and provokes specific emotions from these 'meats', scrutinising them carefully to understand his opponents, ultimately leading to his victory. 

Image 9 shows a drop of blood falling from Sutegama; we've already established that blood symbolises openness and vulnerability, meaning that Baku is finally beginning to see through him. The idea of a 'ripple' (image 10) is used throughout the manga, and I believe it represents Baku's sphere of influence, and how he connects with others. This will be significant when looking at Kyara during Protoporos. 

Image 11 once again juxtaposes both Baku and Sutegama, with Baku in a limbo between life and death, while Sutegama hardly has a scratch on him. Sutegama is frightened by the prospect of a death match, while Baku is excited by it. This compliments the boat symbolism that I will cover in a few lines. 

Image 12 gives us a clear view of Baku's eye, now unclouded by blood and with a shining pupil, meaning that he has both sealed up his weaknesses, and seen through Sutegama completely, with the latter seeing an image of a devilish Baku when now attempting to read him (image 13). 

Images 14-16 directly highlight the difference between Sutegama's methods and Baku's: the former only chooses the boat with no holes, the route with no apparent risks, just as he has played cautiously and shielded throughout the gamble so far. 

However, Baku instead chooses to take a risk, choosing a boat that seems to have holes, but merely superficial ones upon closer inspection: they do not penetrate the boat, they do not hinder his route. 

In choosing to take no risk whatsoever, Sutegama ironically becomes the one with flaws, never being able to take a risk despite this being a gamble after all. Baku however, in taking these extreme risks, offering himself up as bait to Sutegama, has actually removed these flaws, making himself impossible to see through, while Sutegama is left as the predictable one.

My husband  sticks around for most of the feeding, but he’ll pop in and out to eat, pee, make coffee, etc. since the baby will wake up and scream whenever we put him down.

So I \[23F\] was raised in a super traditional, old school Italian home, and never dated outside of my race until him. We'll call him A. We hit it off, and he told me that how I am just overall was ""similar"" to Armenian culture. Because I genuinely wanted to understand him more, I deep dived into Armenian culture, traditions, beliefs, etc. I'm super submissive, a girls-girl for sure, no tattoos, etc. Fast forward to meeting his family for the first time.... I did everything I would normally do, not just ""trying to impress"" anyone.. I made his plate, helped pick up the plates and wash them, etc. I met his mom, dad, his brother (and his wife), his sister, and a cousin. They were so sweet, and I thought it went well. I guess his sister-in-law and sister went outside to have a cigarette after everyone ate, and I was talking to his mom, just answering questions && explaining what I believe in. She asked me if I can go get her daughter in law and daughter to tell them that she was making coffee. So I went in their backyard, and just before I turned the corner, I heard my name and - even though I NEVER spy - I just wanted to see what their thoughts were. I know it's wrong to eavesdrop, but I REALLY was hoping it would go well. Here's what I heard:

1. ""She seems fake. That's how her people are. She's trying too hard, she has brown nose"". That part CAN be true about Italians, there's a LOT about my culture I can't stand, and the fakeness is one of them. But I was being me.
2. ""Who is she that she thinks A needs her to feed him like a baby? He knows what he wants, he doesn't need a blonde \*\*\* to decide for him."" In my mind, making your man a plate is a sign of respect. But I guess not.
3. ""Girls like her see someone like A driving the car he does, and trap them. That's how American women are."" Actually, he got upset whenever I'd try to pay. When we go out, I order the cheapest I can knowing he won't let me pay, and I try to show my appreciation any other way I can.
4. ""Who is she trying to impress telling us about our own people? She discovered wikipedia, so she's so smart. She should just study hers."" All I did was share that I was really into Armenian culture since he taught me a lot about it, and I wanted to learn even more. ""My culture"" isn't aligned with my beliefs.

Anyway, he was everything I've never had in a partner. Unlike ""my own"", he was a leader - and I'm definitely a follower in a relationship, which is what I like. He commanded respect, and it was nice feeling like I was with an actual man. I was raised that when you marry a man, you marry his family. Of course, my parents always thought it would be an Italian, but thankfully it seemed like it wouldn't be.

The next week we broke up. He told me that there are ""too many differences"" and that it would ""never work out"". He knew that my family would NEVER approve of me being with anyone BUT an Italian, and I was more than happy to take that risk for him.

Sorry for the novel, but it's been eating me up. Is it me? Is it really cultural? Did his family act like they liked me, and secretly hated me? I'm so confused, and genuinely want to know moving forward, if I'm ever in this situation again, what I did wrong.

1r6nmu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/daria/comments/1r6nmu2/was_daria_the_only_show_to_do_outcasts_right/,Was Daria the only show to do outcasts right?,"One thing I’ve noticed that bothers me is how people will rewrite their past to give themselves a personal narrative that makes them more interesting. 

Someone like Kid Rock claims to be blue collar and working class when his father owned a chain of auto dealerships in Michigan. 

I’ve noticed the same thing when people recall their adolescence. Todd Solondz, the filmmaker behind the similarly alienation themed, \*Welcome to the Dollhouse\* said that a blonde SUPER MODEL yes super model said that she was essentially the abused protagonist of his film when she was in middle school. 

With the recent passing of James Vander Beek, I was watching a behind the scenes documentary from 1998 where the 20 year old James said he was such an outcast growing up. This immediately following Kevin Williamson and the narrator describing him and a good looking kid and we see his photos from being on the football team. Forget the popularity that comes from being on a football team. If you’re model caliber good looking and you have parents who can afford the money it costs and time to drive you to auditions and acting classes and you’re not deformed or disabled you are in no way an outcast. This coming from blonde, blue eyed white guy no less. 

Anyways, sorry for the tangent getting to the Daria of the matter. 

I think what continues to make Daria relevant is how she and Jane only had each other and didn’t belong to a clique. They weren’t goths, skaters, burn outs, punks, nerds. They were just their own thing, not really quantifiable or categorizable but because of that also extremely isolated and alienated. 

The only other representation of being a true outcast I can think of is Catcher in The Rye. Unlike Daria and Jae however, that protagonist sucks. But even so, that characters alienation from their peers and their anger about the systems that rule their world I think really capture the feeling of being an “outcast” 

Val calls Jane, Daria’s only friend. Similarly in the musical episode Brittany sings, “and I guess someone’s even missing you…” 

Even for teens who weren’t athletes, or in school government or have high GPA’s. lol the groups I mentioned by name before if you spent most weekends hanging out with more than two people and your were booked socially regularly, you were not an outcast. 

Daria and Jane do their best to avoid involvement in school. It’s really only against their will when they are, like the art competition in Arts and Crass, or when they get roped into selling chocolate for the Coffee House or 

Yes, the athletes, school council types and high achievers are respected by the authority of the school administration and their parents, they are privileged in that regard. While other cliques may not be respected or treated fairly, if they are a clique and there is a social group then they are not outcast. 

It’s hard to think of someone as an outcast because authority dislikes them if they spend the weekend smoking weed with a bunch of friends or loitering at the mall with several others. There’s nothing wrong with that but it’s not what makes someone an outcast if you have a host of people you can call up to spend time with you.

Daria and Jane are barely social with each other. Getting pizza and hanging in Jane’s bedroom is just marginally spending time with someone. 

We even get a more alienated example in Ted. 

Quinn mocks Daria calling her a “loser” since doing her homework for her on a Friday night instead of sitting around at home is “something to do” 

Moreover, when Daria leaves the house for altenapalooza, we see how thrilled Helen and Jake are to have the house to themselves because it’s implied Daria is always at home.

What’s great about Daria as show is that it almost worked as a deconstruction of the high school mentality regarding cliques. Daria and Jane defy cliques and we see the independence of Quinn, Stacey, Jodi. Even Kevin and Brittany feel like their own people at times.

One of the main themes of the show is qualitative vs quantitative relationships. Quinn’s band with the fashion club is superficial. She has doubts and shows signs of moving on from them in Is It Fall Yet. 

The show also showed the danger of only having one friend to go to when the girls had a falling out like over Tommy Sherman or Tom Sloan. Hey they’re both Toms! It shows how they could be even more alienated and isolated without developing relationships with other people.

What I like most about the show is how Daria and Jane don’t change for anyone to fit in. They are peer pressured like when Jane was on the track team or when Daria wanted to get pierced to impress Trent. They developed and grew from those experiences, they changed a little but really learned more about themselves and what they valued. It’s not change so much as becoming a different person so much as figuring out who you are. 

Anyways, I like how Daria’s team was aware enough to know that being an outcast is more about marching to the best of your own drum.",5,1771279818.0,daria,1,1.0,False

What blows my mind is he was so furious and pissed off this morning that he told me that he hopes I have another sezuire. And I've hurt myself so many times while having sezuires and times where I've been close to death and him saying that fkn broke my heart. I don't belive he actually love's me and it's effecting me badly. But I grew up with a family that we got along and lived with both parent's I don't want to be a single parent , I want to work on thing's, if we have to go to couples counseling I will do anything for this family it's really breaking me inside though . 🥺

1r6nkew,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1r6nkew/need_to_rant_am_i_looking_into_it_too_much/,Need to Rant + Am i looking into it too much?,"I’m internalizing the way I feel about my friend & this brings out a person in me when i’m around her that i am not normally. I hate this feeling so much because it literally is the opposite of who I am & in the moment with her around, I cannot help but honestly be a straight up bitch sometimes (context coming). I don’t feel holly jolly like i usually do with friends or her in the past tbh. 

In the past, only one other friend has made me feel this way & with this friend I was able to tell her how I felt, there was little change so I took some distance. During the distance, I felt that the friendship wasn’t serving either of us & felt that we are naturally coming to end where we take 2 different paths. I am proud of myself for doing that. I no longer feel resentment but just distal love for her & the good memories we did have. 

Now with this current friend, it is a LOT more complicated. Originally, it was a trio (we are not a typical trio since we all met separately, no one was introduced to another so no duos truly). It was great and THEN we introduced her (call her E) to some of our guy friends. Everyone clicked, we became a big friend group. Fast forward, E starts dating one of the guys (this will be relevant later.) 

Anyways…here are my issues with her as a person that I feel end up clashing with me. 1. Constant interrupting, not listening. Some examples: I was in the midst of a story, E randomly goes “Omg that coffee shop is so good!” (didn’t bother me cause fair enough we are driving by & you want to point it out). However, at this point she is consistently interrupting & it felt like it’s on purpose especially when she doesn’t care for what I’m saying so it’s like she takes the opportunity to shut it down so she won’t have to listen at all. Because yes the interrupting in this case wasn’t the biggest issue but more so the fact that she didn’t follow this up with “Sorry, I interrupted go on.” Or simply, “go on” Nope she just heard me literally get cut off mid sentence by her and then I shut up and didn’t even respond to whatever tf she said to give her a taste of her own medicine (not who i am, feel vengeful atm). I think a more clear example of not caring is a time where E was telling us some tea for an entire 30 minutes to which we paid full attention to, not even touching our phones. The other girl in trio goes to build on that & tell her own “relatable” story after E talking for 30 minutes & immediately as she’s talking, E starts to type away on her phone instead of being an active listener as we were with her. I instantly glanced at her & the phone & I think she got that she was being rude. With all this interrupting (examples are not the only times), I’ve resorted to just not saying much with her around. Also she’ll literally talk non-stop with no input from me about things I can only care so much about & only have so many responses for. It’s like she filler talks so I don’t get the chance to talk about what’s on my mind. 2. Backseat driving to the point where I just said “you’re passenger princess so just relax.” She does this to almost everyone & many don’t appreciate it because it’s not even the person being a bad driver it’s more so telling them “faster” routes (it’s not) or this one time she tells me at a YEILD that I can just go since the lane I’d be driving onto is a merge lane but there was oncoming traffic 😐 technically i wouldn’t hit anyone but in this case, the yield is before the merge so i must yield to traffic BEFORE i merge (something that my other friend in the trio actually got honked at for). Was sure to correct her on that since she has a very righteous personality. 3. Telling her bf embarrassing stories / things about me I don’t necessarily want people to know. This is especially annoying because her bf is my friend & he’ll stupidly mention what she told him as a joke to me. This has happened multiple times where I’m just dumbfounded and looking at her face because WHYYY does your bf know that let alone why are yall talking about me? This is affecting the friendship VERY deeply as I no longer tell her anything I wouldn’t want to tell the bf. 

Alright this last one is something i should probably talk to a therapist about because I admit it’s coming from a place of hyper independence & I think the fact that her & I are both eldest daughters does not help. I often feel like she treats everyone the way she would a younger sibling which is fine when it’s actually your younger sibling but as my own person I really don’t need you to speak for me when people are directly speaking to me or “do this, do that.” I think that’s why the driving thing irks me too cause we learnt to drive at the SAME TIME. I have no tickets, no accidents while she does 🤨. 

All in all this is way more complicated because I’m entangled into a friend group now where she’s dating one of them so confrontation could mean completely dissolving that group or a convo where things change (rare). 

Tension was also added when her bf made uncomfortable comments about my body & job. “You need to wax your armpits.” It was stubble that obviously couldn’t be waxed yet & the only reason he could see it was because i took my hoodie off after spilling on it. “Your belly button is big!” I have a keloid scar from my piercing lol. Personally, if my bf noticed so much about another girl, I’d be spiraling ",1,1771279667.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

**My Background**

I'm an IT pro with no prior experience as a dedicated PM role, but I've led some OS upgrade projects in the past which I listed on my PMP application.

**Study Resources & Timeline**

Dec 4: Purchased AR 35-hr Course for $20 but didn't start studying until January because of the holidays. Most of January I consumed this course during my commute on 1.5x speed.

Jan 18: Purchased Study Hall (SH) Essentials and went through all 700+ practice questions over the next few weeks. I had 62% average score after all questions.

Feb 5-8: I took a vacation and used the 10 total hours on plane to go over AR 12-hr Cram Course on 1.5x speed (free via employer)

Feb 8: Purchased [Third3Rock PMP Guide](https://third3rockpmp.com/) but didn't look at it. Scheduled my online home PMP exam for Feb 16.

Feb 9-12: Completed all SH Mini Exams and got 78% overall with an average answer time of 1:04. I decided not to do any full mock exams because I wanted to save my stamina for the real test.

Feb 13-15: Went through the 80-page Third3Rock cheat sheet 3x. Skimmed sections that I was confident in, then read word-for-word sections that I needed to practice more.

Throughout Jan-Feb I watched these videos in my spare time:

* [MR Mindset 1](https://youtu.be/83y-aBdS1iY?si=gsJG2XZM6AVq1m63) & [Mindset 2](https://youtu.be/bOKpDPRfkvo?si=9EOi3XmJKenHoCw_)
* [DM Fast Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOJ_yEeyuc)
* [DM PMBOK in 1 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gmCr40uT4U)
* [DM Test Strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFi9gWOhZK4)
* [DM Are You Ready?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k25eJDUU-J0)
* [DM Agile in 15 Mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpKA9UuM1w)
* [AR 50 Principles](https://youtu.be/-u0rO-YQr9c?si=Ij8hV-jsp1ElcTU2)
* [AR 200 Ultra Hard Questions ](https://youtu.be/1sWpc6765AI?si=vk7TGDdzyFzFhbpg)(did the first 50)

**Exam Day**

I ate oatmeal, blueberries, and scrambled eggs to make sure I didn't get too hungry during the exam. Drank a cup of coffee while I took a 1-mile walk and listened to a final cram of the mindset principles on 2x speed.

Started exam check-in at 9am with no issues. The first 30 questions seemed like the most difficult for me for some reason. Got a drag-and-drop question right off the bat. But once I got a rhythm down I got in the zone and started going fairly quickly.

Honestly, I was flying through and thought ""*This is very good news or very bad*."" I know it's a toss up on what questions you get, but in my opinion I felt the real exam questions were much easier than SH.

If you know the mindset principles and know the test taking strategy:

1. Read question carefully
2. Highlight keywords
3. Know exactly what the problem is
4. Quickly eliminate 2 answers based on mindset
5. Choose the 1 answer leftover that addresses the problem

I had quite a few drag/drop questions which I never practiced during my studying so that was the only thing that sort of slowed me down. I didn't have any calculations. It was mostly agile heavy, but you definitely need to know predictive just as well IMO.

I think 80% of the exam I felt super confident in and answered really quickly. The other 20% I had to re-read the question and really take more time deciding between answers.

I finished the exam with 70 minutes remaining, and I honestly didn't feel too fatigued, but the last 20 questions were probably the toughest because I was tired of staring at a screen for so long.

**Final Thoughts**

My suggestion (and what worked for me):

* Complete a full course (required for PMP app anyway)
* Complete condensed/cram course to cover essentials
* Learn and know the mindset principles by heart through repetition
* Diversify mediums (watch/listen/read) so you can remember better
* Complete all SH practice questions
* Review all incorrect questions to understand the correct answer
* Schedule exam when you are scoring well on mini or mocks (70%+)

During the exam, if you know the mindset principles you can most likely narrow the answers down to 2 choices, then go back to the question and see which option solves the problem BETTER than the other option.

Because a lot of the times the 2 choices could be correct. But the point is testing your ability to be presented with 2 possible ""correct"" answers but choosing the one that BEST fits the PMP mindset that PMI expects.

Good luck! Don't stress out. I think most people overestimate the difficulty of taking a timed 180-question test. Don't let it get to you. Focus on one question at a time, and get in a rhythm.

Also, wear blue :)

1r6njby,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1r6njby/how_to_talk_to_any_woman_without_being_weird_the/,How To Talk To Any Woman Without Being Weird: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I used to freeze up every time I wanted to talk to a woman. Literally couldn't get words out. Studied this obsessively for months through books, psychology research, communication experts, dating coaches, all of it. Turns out most advice out there is either creepy pickup artist garbage or useless ""just be yourself"" platitudes. 

The real issue? We're fighting against evolutionary biology and broken social scripts. Your brain treats approaching women like a life-threatening situation because rejection historically meant social exile from the tribe. Modern dating apps and porn have rewired our reward systems. Society tells men to be confident but also not too forward, be interesting but don't try hard, and show interest but don't be creepy. It's contradictory as hell.

Here's what genuinely works:

**\*\*Stop treating conversations with women differently\*\***

Your brain goes into ""special mode"" when talking to attractive women, and that's when you become weird. The attractive barista, the girl at the bookstore, and your coworker are just people having a regular day. Start conversations the same way you'd talk to anyone. Comment on the environment, ask a genuine question, or make an observation. ""This coffee shop is packed today"" works infinitely better than some rehearsed opener. The goal isn't to immediately show romantic interest; it's just to be a normal human having a normal interaction.

**\*\*Get comfortable with micro interactions first\*\***

Don't jump straight to asking someone out. Build your tolerance gradually. Make small talk with cashiers, compliment someone's dog at the park, and ask a stranger for directions even when you don't need them. Psychologist Dr. Ellen Hendriksen talks about this in her book ""[How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety](https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Yourself-Critic-Anxiety/dp/1250122228)."" She breaks down exposure therapy principles that actually rewire your threat response. The book won awards for social anxiety research, and honestly, reading it felt like someone explaining my exact brain patterns. This is the best practical psychology book on social confidence I've read.

**\*\*Master the art of reading signals\*\***

Most guys either completely miss interest or imagine it where it doesn't exist. Learn the actual signs. Does she turn her body toward you? Ask follow-up questions? Does she touch her hair or jewelry while talking to you? These are green lights. Is she giving one-word answers, looking around the room, or stepping backward? Stop talking and exit gracefully. Vanessa Van Edwards runs a human behavior lab and her YouTube channel. Science of People breaks down body language research in stupid simple terms. Her videos on detecting genuine vs polite smiles alone will change how you read interactions.

**\*\*Stop waiting for the perfect moment\*\***

That voice telling you to wait until you're funnier, richer, more confident, and better looking? It's a procrastination trap. There is no perfect version of you that's coming. You improve by doing the uncomfortable thing repeatedly until it becomes comfortable. Rejection will sting, but regret haunts you forever. The 3-second rule actually works; act before your brain generates 50 reasons not to. Think of it as jumping into cold water; the longer you stand there, the worse it gets.

**\*\*Have actual conversations, not interviews\*\***

Stop interrogating women with boring questions. ""What do you do? Where are you from? Do you come here often?"" is a job interview, not a conversation. Share observations, tell brief stories, and be mildly playful. If she mentions she's reading a book, don't just ask what it's about. Say something like, ""I haven't read a physical book in months; I'm basically illiterate now. what's it about?"" It's self-deprecating, slightly funny, and opens the door for actual dialogue.

**\*\*Practice through the app Replika or Character. AI\*\***

Sounds weird, but these AI chat apps let you practice conversation flow without stakes. You can experiment with different styles, see what lands, and build confidence in your ability to banter. It's like a flight simulator for social skills. Obviously real humans are different, but it helps reduce that initial anxiety of ""what do I even say.""

For something more structured that covers all the books and research I mentioned, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450). It's an AI learning app from former Google engineers that pulls from dating psychology books, communication research, and expert insights to create personalized audio lessons. You can set a specific goal like ""become more confident talking to women as an introvert,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan around your unique struggles and personality. 

The depth control is clutch; you can do a quick 10-minute summary during your commute or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when you want to go deeper. Plus you can customize the voice; I use the smoky one because it actually keeps me engaged instead of zoning out. Way more digestible than forcing yourself through entire books when you're already exhausted from work.

**\*\*Fix your body language before you open your mouth\*\***

Stand up straight, make eye contact, and speak clearly. Confidence is like 70% physical. Dr. Amy Cuddy's research on power poses shows that body language literally changes your hormone levels. Two minutes of standing in a confident pose before a social interaction increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. Her TED talk has, like, 60 million views for a reason. You can fake the physical part until the mental part catches up.

**\*\*Accept that you'll be awkward sometimes\*\***

Even the smoothest people have weird interactions. The difference is they don't internalize it as an identity-defining failure. You fumbled a conversation? Cool, you're human. Learn from it and move on. Self-compassion beats self-criticism every time for actual improvement. 

**\*\*Get off dating apps if they're destroying your confidence\*\***

Apps turn humans into products. The constant rejection, ghosting, and superficial judgments wreck your self-worth. Real-world interactions have warmth, nuance, and chemistry that don't translate through a screen. If apps work for you, great. If they make you miserable, delete them and practice talking to people in real life.

Look, there's no magic formula. It gets easier with repetition. Start small, be genuine, and accept discomfort as the price of growth. Your awkward ass can absolutely learn this skill.",1,1771279599.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

**Opinion**: It has a lot of smut. It's the Reputation era. What did you expect? The trilogy of one-shots is set between Season 1 and before Season 2. The story fits very well with the canon, and what I like most is the obsession they both have with each other and that anger after learning the truth about Tyler and his Hyde.

* [Cruel summer](https://archiveofourown.org/works/55331824/chapters/140376559) by Terpsi\_19

**Status**: Completed

**Song**: Cruel Summer

**Summary**: Wednesday hated summer, and this one was the worst of all: Tyler Galpin had moved to Jericho.

  
**Opinion**: This is mine. It's an AU where she doesn't have powers and Wednesday refuses to be in a relationship but doesn't want to leave Tyler free for others. Friends with benefits would be the best way to describe it.

**Status**: In progress

**Song**: This is me trying

**Summary**: Wednesday Addams’ day begins the same; her day ends the same. This happens eleven times.

The twelfth time is different.

*Tyler* is different.

**Opinion**: Although it's not finished, it's one of my favorites. Wednesday and Tyler end up in a time loop where they must find a way to stop Crackstone before the day they met comes to an end.

It's very funny and also somewhat gory (two words that shouldn't go together); it's reminiscent of the movie Happy Death Day.

That is, until they meet Wednesday Addams.

**Status**: Incomplete

**Song**: Peace

**Summary**: Tyler Galpin has always liked rain.

It’s a force of nature like no other. It can give life and take it away all in one stroke. Whether it’s flash floods that sweep away anyone and anything, or fertilizing plants in the soil of the Earth. It’s split, right down the middle. A little bit destructive, a little bit helpful.

**Summary**: Tyler has written wednesday a letter every day since he came to Willowhill psychiatric hospital.

Wednesday is back from her first semester break at Nevermore. Will these letters break through her cold broken heart or will they go up in flames?

Tyler gives her quite the welcome.

* ['tis the damn season](https://archiveofourown.org/works/52480753/chapters/132765769) by Samantha\_winchester

**Status**: Incomplete

**Song**: 'tis the damn season

**Summary**: Wednesday and Tyler's arrangement has been the same ever since Wednesday left town for college-when she was away, they lived their own separate lives, but when she came home, whether it be for two days, two weeks, or two months, they'd be... whatever they are. Now that Wednesday's home for the holidays, her and Tyler are falling back into the same routine they've had for the last seven years. After all, ""It always leads to you in my hometown...""

**Opinion**: I love it, I love it, I love it! I don't know how many times I've read it. There are only two chapters, but they cut me to the core. Tyler and Wednesday's longing is palpable in every word. It's excellently written; you feel the pain in your chest and the butterflies in your stomach. It's like missing someone who's right next to you.

**Status**: Completed

**Song**: Fortnite

**Summary**: After 10 years, Wednesday and Tyler meet again in a way they never imagined. They're neighbors. And now, they both have to deal with feelings they thought were buried.

**Opinion**: This is also mine. Tyler and Wednesday are married (to other people). When they meet again, they have to deal with the feelings they had and the complications of their own marriages.  


* [Afraid (of little old me)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/55810552/chapters/141694909) by WinterRose98

 **Statute**: Progress

**Song**: Who's Afraid of a Little Old Me

**Summary:** What makes a monster a monster?

Tyler didn't know, and had long since stopped caring. But on the road with a girl he'd never expected to see again, Tyler Galpin was certain of one thing.

Laurel Gates made a big mistake dying when she did. 

**Opinion**: It's really, really good! Even though it started before the second season, Tyler and Wednesday's attitude is very similar to what we saw in the canon. It has explicit violence.

I highly recommend it.

He blinked. “Cool?”

“Yeah,” She nodded. “Can I get a quad over ice?”

“You’re not going to mention anything?” Tyler asked, apprehensively. “You came here for just a quad?”

Wednesday stared at the nervous mess of a barista that was standing in front of her. “It is a coffee shop.”

**Summary**: There were bonds stronger than those that tied a Hyde to his master.

**Opinion**: This one's mine too. Here I tried to explore the idea that the Hyde family loses their minds when they lose their master. It's 100% angst and has themes of suicide.

I swapped from FreeCAD to SolidWorks Design and I'm finally able to actually finish projects instead of fighting the software.

I designed this to fit the 20oz Dixie coffee cups and lids we use, but it should fit other brands around that size. I gave it extra wiggle space for that reason. It also has a pleasant fuzzy skin out the outer surfaces.

The inner diameter of each section is ~96mm and the full object is around 202 x 102 x 202 mm.

The infill is very low, so I advise increasing it if it'll be used in a high traffic area, having children around who might bonk it, etc.

1r6nak9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mint99/comments/1r6nak9/best_countertop_microwaves_under_200/,Best countertop microwaves under $200,"Hey everyone.

If you are not familiar with us, we are from Requiremints (operating also the Mint99 product research platform) and we spend our time comparing appliances so you don't have to. We recently reviewed 30+ countertop microwaves to find the best ones you can grab for under $200.

Here are a few things to consider before buying:

* **Check the wattage** \- Most cheap ones are 700 watts which is slow. Look for 900-1000 watts if you want your leftovers hot in a reasonable amount of time.
* **Internal size** \- Capacity is measured in cubic feet. 0.9 cu. ft. is great for dorms, but you generally need 1.2 cu. ft. or more to fit a full dinner plate comfortably.
* **Key features** \- Decide if you just need a heater or a cooker. Some models now include air fryers or ""inverter"" tech which cooks food evenly instead of blasting it.

# Best Overall & Performance

* **\[Best Overall Value\] Toshiba 1.2 Cu. Ft. (EM131A5C)** \- This is the sweet spot for most homes. It has a sensor that actually works to prevent rubbery food, runs quiet, and fits a standard dinner plate easily.
* **\[Best Performance Pick\] Toshiba 1.6 Cu. Ft. Inverter (ML-EM45PIT)** \- If you hate cold spots in your food, get this. The inverter technology cooks evenly, and the massive interior fits a 12-inch pizza with room to spare.
* **\[Best Large Budget\] Black+Decker 1.4 Cu. Ft. (EM036AB14)** \- A reliable pick if you need family-sized capacity without spending much. It is simple to operate, safe for kids, and heats large meals consistently.

# Best for Small Spaces & Style

* **\[Best Small Air-Fryer\] Black+Decker 0.9 Cu. Ft Convection (ES9P032NA)** \- A tiny beast that does way more than reheat coffee. It air fries, bakes, and roasts, saving you from buying multiple appliances for a small kitchen.
* **\[Best Retro Style\] Comfee 0.9 Cu. Ft (CMO-MMP02)** \- If you want something that looks cool on the counter, this is it. It is compact, has a handy mute button, and handles basic heating perfectly well.
* **\[Best Vintage Look\] Nostalgia 0.9 Cu. Ft. Retro** \- Another stylish option that leans into the classic diner vibe. The control dial is fun to use, and it fits easily into tight corners or dorm rooms.

# Best Budget Picks

* **\[Best Price Performance\] Farberware 1.3 Cu. Ft. (FMO13AHTBKE)** \- Hard to beat the price for this size. You get full 1000-watt power and decent space for around 100 bucks, making it a solid no-frills workhorse.
* **\[Best Basic Option\] Black+Decker 1.1 Cu. Ft. (EM031MB11)** \- A straightforward choice for smaller families. It covers all the essentials without being too complicated, making it a safe bet for a simple, everyday microwave.

Hopefully this helps narrow it down for you. If you want more info or to use filters to see other brands or specific sizes, you should check the full research on [our research page of countertop microwaves under $200](https://requiremints.com/guide/best-countertop-microwaves-under-200-usd/).

1r6n7t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1r6n7t2/aio_for_blocking_situationship_on_valentines_day/,AIO for blocking Situation-ship on Valentines Day,"To preface, me and this person were never officially labeled as a couple and it was very much a whirlwind romance that felt like it nosedived quickly. I genuinely had a blast hanging out with them platonically but pretty much all our hang outs had some type of physical intimacy mixed in which was fine at first but started taking a toll on me mentally because this person had initiated wanting us to be friends only. They however would tell me how amazing and kind I am as well as saying things like how they hadn’t realized how much they missed me after going on a date. I started noticing how one sided it all was as I supported the dates they went on but anytime I mentioned someone I was interested in it always ended in a snarky reply or general hate about the person having known nothing about them. Fast forward, I have started rejecting any type of physical relationship with him now and meet an awesome person through my job who I instantly connected with. We exchanged socials and talked nonstop for a bit but i then found out he’s married which really threw me off. We were still messaging though after him telling me and although I was insanely attracted I knew I had to put a boundary in place. The next day on valentines I had told my situation-ship about it because it had been constantly in my mind and he immediately started making rude comments about him and his profession as well as the whole married situation in general. I felt so hurt because I truly felt a malicious intent behind his words and tried to switch the subject but he kept bringing it back up. I was so upset I showed him a picture from his social because I wanted him to know this was just a normal guy .There was no reason to be so mean and he even admitted the guy was attractive. This was all within probably a 20 min timeframe getting coffee. I gave him a little gift and card before he dropped me home and honestly knew that was it for us right then. I immediately went to text the other guy but discovered I had been blocked by him within those few minutes of showing my friend his profile. It was so confusing because he initiated almost all convos other than me asking to exchange socials and then out of the blue blocks me. I have no idea why and so many different scenarios in my head of what could have happened that lead to that. His wife is not living with him as he’s in my area for school and he also told me he was solo for the day so that one didn’t seem likely but I also can’t help but think my situation-ship messaged him because of how angry he got while we were having coffee. We follow each other on socials and he was being very weird on his phone during that as well which in the moment didn’t think much of. He has had weird behavior like that in the past like showing up with a date to an event I had constantly told him I was excited about going to which really hurt. I ended up blocking him same day just out of anger for everything he’s said to me but part of me feels I could be overreacting. Am I? Or is it just a crazy coincidence. The unknowing kills me and I don’t wanna ask him out of fear and because I feel our paths have finished crossing. ",0,1771278882.0,AIO,3,0.5,False

I work in a hospital laboratory where I’m constantly moving between samples, documentation, and PPE so stepping away to reapply lipstick just isn’t realistic. I’m looking for lip stains that genuinely last most (or all) of a shift with minimal touch ups.

What I’ve learned so far: traditional creamy lipsticks and even many “long wear” liquids break down fast with masks, talking, and hydration. The products that actually survive a workday tend to be true stains water-based or tint-absorbing formulas that leave pigment in the lip rather than sitting on top of it. Matte transfer proof layers help, but a stain underneath is what keeps color from disappearing after meals or coffee.

Application method matters almost as much as the product. Exfoliating lightly beforehand (soft cloth or gentle sugar scrub) prevents patchiness, then applying a thin layer, blotting, and adding a second layer dramatically increases longevity. Letting it fully dry before putting on a mask is key. A clear balm or very thin lip oil on top keeps lips comfortable without lifting the pigment.

I’d love recommendations for stains that:  
• survive masks and long talking periods  
• fade evenly instead of flaking  
• don’t dry lips out after 8–12 hours  
• work without constant mirror checks

Bonus points if they handle coffee + lunch without leaving the dreaded inner lip ring.

I feeling sleepy, so I deliberately tried to enter an active imagination state, basically attempting to access my subconscious.

With my eyes closed, I saw myself inside a cylinder, like the center of a clock. I could see two square shapes rotating like the tips of clock hands, and I somehow sensed two more behind my back. In total there were four squares positioned north, south, east, and west, rotating clockwise. The whole thing felt like a mechanism of condemnation. It had this intense “fate” atmosphere to it.

Then I sensed a godlike figure, Zeus-like, dressed in ancient clothing, floating slightly above me. It felt static, almost statue-like, but extremely heavy and oppressive. I was still aware I was in my bed with my eyes closed. The space around me felt like it was melting, not visually but atmospherically, like a vibration or frequency.

\- At least 5 beds for 4 kids and a master

\- At least three bathrooms

Changes / Notes

\- There is a basement which I put the entrance under the stairs in the foyer

\- I moved around a lot of the room layouts for better flow and a tighter circle

\- The foyer was turned 90 degrees as the other version had too big of a foyer

\- Since people wanted to know which way was the front and the back yard I added the labels and a garage to the plan

\- Butler pantry actually accessible from Dining room

\- NO LONGER EATING WHERE WE SHIT

\- Added French door in dining room and a door in kitchen to access the back yard for cooks outs

\- Upstairs redone to maximize space, keep rooms about the same size and added a third bathroom to split between the kids.

\- There are two bigger bedrooms that on of the older kids will get and the other is for guests since I had room

\- Master bed is now at top of stairs so kids can’t sneak down without going past. In the last post I would arranged the master like I did to have the fireplace cause I thought that would be neat, but with only one being in this layout it was kinda hard to.

I believe that covered most of what was addressed. I love the T Shaped farm houses and would like to keep that overall shape, and I added a picture found from google as imperfect reference to what I would like the outside and general shape of the house.

Again this is for fun, for now, and I am not working with an architect as we are not in that stage and I know it depends on the land we have but we live in a pretty flat area with some good ground so it shouldn’t be an issue.

the same logic can be applied to the $9.99 monthly card. you get 680 shellys, same as the shop, but you get a total of 3240 shellys. NOT TO MENTION all of the other benefits included: ",4,1771278583.0,MyLeisureTime,3,1.0,False

It has great bones but is feeling a bit dated. Lots of brown and the walls are a yellowish beige with color matched ceilings which makes repainting kinda tricky. The living room floors are a beautiful real hardwood, but the kitchen, living, dining and bathroom, as well as the shower walls are all brown tile. Kitchen countertops are brown stone. Kitchen cabinets are off white (I hate them). 

I’d like to inject some life into these spaces, let’s start with the living room. I’d be willing to repaint but would have to paint the ceiling too. 🫤 If there is a way to work WITH the existing wall color and flooring, even better.

He loves this big ass gray sectional, so it has to stay until it dies. Everything else is fair game, BUT:

1. Everything has to be functional. I don’t want any pieces that don’t have purpose or at least sentimental value. 

2. This space will have two primary purposes: play for our baby once she starts playing (and toy storage), and watching TV or lounging. We will take a Montessori style approach so having toys accessible is important. A Pikler triangle will likely be added to this space soon. For this reason, having the space open (ie no coffee table) is essential. 

3. I am feeling more and more drawn toward maximalist styles, and would appreciate suggestions for color and texture!

My problem is is that I need coffee with cream when I immediately wake up and I also need breakfast, which is usually cereal and milk. 

I guess I’m just trying to figure out when you all take your medication. 

My usual routine is that I wake up at 6:30, immediately get my coffee and then get ready. I give myself an hour and then eat breakfast. 

Besides coffee and dairy is there anything else I need to avoid or be mindful of? ",1,1771278413.0,Hashimotos,6,1.0,False

\- Time moves differently in The Time of legends *(It’s still hard to figure out)* Contrary to belief, Evil does rule over it. [There is a small town](https://www.reddit.com/r/yumeshippersunite/comments/1r3eud9/3_the_town_in_the_time_of_legends_time_bandits/) ,that the Fortress over shadows, that Evil/Ama love to abuse and torment. 

  
 \- Evil is able to create, but not at the same level of the Supreme Being. *(He’s still very cocky, and looks at Amaranth as his  Magnum Opus. His “Precious Flower"" ).*  
  
 \- Since Amaranth is created from Evil’s very essences, she does have same abilities as her “ father’s ” along with some abilities, all her own *(as does he).*  
  
  
\- Evil being who he is, never sleeps. He’s incapable*, but given Amaranth’s design, she does require sleep. That it’s now become a regular ritual, where he will join her, and*  ***""rest his eyes""***  *in her bed, now turned theirs. It has now become his respite. Among, the* ***"" other things""*** *they do in that bed.*  
  
*-  Rarely does he use her actual name. Only when he is being absolutely serious, or when emotions( Be in passionate, or when  terrified) are very intense!*    
  
  
*-  Though villains are often stereotyped as favoring black coffee or bitter tea,* ***Evil and Amaranth defy cliché with deliberate, decadent flair****. They drink hot coco. (As in a historical stand point  it was seen as a aristocratic delicacy)*  
  
  
\-  For funny reasons, I love the idea Evil’s main henchman (Robert, Benson, Horseflesh), will always regenerate *(Painfully so. Which Evil/Ama delight in)* after being blowing away from another one of Evil/Ama’s mood swings.   
  
\- I also subscribe to the original script concept, Horseflesh was one of the Bandits. *(Randell mention him in the film, by name. And the ending credits kept his name, so what is up with that? Why were the Bandits not stunned to see Horseflesh, ALIVE!? )*  
  
*-*  Speaking about the original script concept, there was one delete scene in particular, where Kevin/The Bandits were caught by Spider Women. The scene was filmed, but pulled for time. Sadly that footage was destroy, when the achieves were flooded.  The scene sill exists in the transcript*.*  I deiced to bring them back in my fan continuation, with a bit of creative licenses. Expending their lore and origins. Firstly, they were originally named Maisie and Myrtle. Who had no connection to Evil at all.

I renamed them Edith and Agatha *( you can read a one shot with them* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/yumeshippersunite/comments/1r3f6vz/5_threads_of_contested_parentage_time_bandits_1981/)*)* and they do work for Evil. They are part of larger Arachnes race, that lives in The Time of legends.  Evil managed to (*partly)* gain this races’ loyalty, though they still butt heads constantly. As they are not his minions, or servants. They have an **“agreement.**“  That he makes sure, they never forget.  
  
He is still their master. This is his domain! *(and if they over step, they will meet his wrath)* The colony lives in deeper parts of the fortress. Coming and going as they please *(It’s unknown how they felt after their Master’s demise, but they quickly got with program once he returned, and reclaimed order)*  ",1,1771278350.0,yumeshippersunite,0,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

We turn it into a transaction. A process. Something we have to work toward, earn our way through, struggle to achieve. We write books about it. Attend seminars. Spend years in therapy trying to “let go.”

The cat knocks your coffee off the table. You yell. The cat walks away.

Five minutes later, the cat is back in your lap, purring. Not because it “worked through” its feelings. Not because it decided you “deserved” another chance.

The cat just… moved on. The moment passed. Why carry it?

We think holding onto anger makes us strong. That grudges protect us. That refusing to forgive gives us power over the person who wronged us.

But who’s actually trapped?

The person who hurt you is out there living their life. You’re the one replaying the conversation at 2 AM. You’re the one carrying the weight.

The cat doesn’t forgive because forgiveness implies the offense is still real, still present, still worth acknowledging.

The cat just lets it go. Not as a gift to anyone else. As a gift to itself.

Be like cat.

I’m a 30-year-old Engineer living in Stuttgart, and while the job title might suggest I spend my days staring at spreadsheets (guilty as charged, occasionally), there’s a bit more to the story than that. I grew up in Dubai, I’m Pakistani by nationality, but I’ve well and truly settled in Germany for the long haul. It’s a bit of a vibe here, isn't it?

The ""Essential Stats"":
The Faith: I’m Muslim, which for me means no drinking, no smoking, and a strong preference for a good Halal burger. That said, I’m not exactly ""old school."" I’m looking for someone to head to the mosque with on Friday, but who’s also down to hit the beach on Saturday.

The Dynamic: I’m a big believer in ""you do you."" Whether you wear a hijab or not is entirely your call. I’m looking for a partner, not a project.

The Goal: I’m in this for the long run. Marriage, building a life together, the whole nine yards.
What I’m actually like to hang out with:
I’m probably the most well-scented man in Stuttgart. I’ve got a bit of an obsession with perfume collecting (I can talk notes and sillage for hours, sorry in advance). When I’m not smelling like a top-tier department store, I’m usually:
-In the gym or obsessing over my skincare routine. (Look, mental health and wellness are a priority—gotta keep the engine running smoothly).
Losing at chess (or winning, if I’ve had my coffee).

-Learning a new language or planning a random weekend trip to explore a new city.

-Buried in a book. I recently finished Project Hail Mary (brilliant), Everything is Fucked (too real), and The Song of Achilles (yes, it broke me, let’s not talk about it).

Who I’m looking for:
A woman aged 25–35 who is looking for something serious but doesn’t take life too seriously. If you’re kind, enjoy a bit of travel, and don’t mind a man who spends more time on his skincare than you might expect, we’ll probably get on famously.

If you’re in Germany (or planning to be) and fancy a chat, hit me up. Tell me your favorite travel spot or the last book that actually made you feel something.

1r6mvgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1r6mvgd/the_cat_doesnt_forgive_the_cat_forgets/,The cat doesn’t forgive. The cat forgets.,"Humans make forgiveness so complicated.

We turn it into a transaction. A process. Something we have to work toward, earn our way through, struggle to achieve. We write books about it. Attend seminars. Spend years in therapy trying to “let go.”

The cat knocks your coffee off the table. You yell. The cat walks away.

Five minutes later, the cat is back in your lap, purring. Not because it “worked through” its feelings. Not because it decided you “deserved” another chance.

The cat just… moved on. The moment passed. Why carry it?

We think holding onto anger makes us strong. That grudges protect us. That refusing to forgive gives us power over the person who wronged us.

But who’s actually trapped?

The person who hurt you is out there living their life. You’re the one replaying the conversation at 2 AM. You’re the one carrying the weight.

The cat doesn’t forgive because forgiveness implies the offense is still real, still present, still worth acknowledging.

The cat just lets it go. Not as a gift to anyone else. As a gift to itself.

Be like cat.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Welcome back, one and all! I come bearing progress towards completion by finishing off another RO! This time, the newest face (so far) in the Monster Prom world, the Influencer Reaper, Milo Belladonna!  Additionally, in addition to showcasing their outcome breakdowns, I've also finished off 2 of the most difficult drink endings to farm outcomes out of, as well as reveal new strategies I've encountered since!  

Lastly, as you might have gleaned from the ""Total Runs"" chart, I have now SEEN every Secret ending and Event, with just outcomes and Special Stuff left to peruse.  I did this to just ensure I had every tool at my disposal, and also verify that I didn't run into the ""Narrator frequency"" Problem I ran into in 1st term because I saved him for last, but also make sure it wasn't a pre-requisite for something ""Spooky"" I unlocked at the back of this slideshow...



Let's move onto the featured content first, shall we?



# N: Introducing, Milo Belladonna's Analysis!

  
Milo Belladonna is the first (and only) new RO added in this Monster Prom sequel (The others either being returning ROs or NPCs from the first game), but has taken the primary stat requirements of Zoe (Creative/Charm), with the stat balance of Liam (Even Primary/Secondary).  In Short Single Player, expect to have both your Creativity AND Charm at 8pts or higher, while in Long SP games you should be gunning for 16 in each.  As for Heart points, I'll need to check further, but I believe that Milo has a pretty high Heart Point requirement, alluded to via one of my strategy discoveries found later in this post.

*  Like all the other ROs, Milo has 8x ""Anywhere"" events, plus 2x ""Solo Location"" events per area, and 3x ""Date"" events.
   * Where Milo diverges from the rest of the pack, however, is that they only have 5x Group events in the Lake and Woods, compared to the 6x that all other events/RO combinations have
* Milo's RNG Plotline, YOLO, is unique compared to all other secret plotlines, as the third and final event only counts as a seen event, with no ""traditional"" outcomes.  While there are 2 prompts (with 4x options each: two failures and two successes), none of these outcomes (be it success or fail) are tallied on the outcome tracker (FWIW I've succeeded AND failed on this event just to see how they differ).  This makes Milo (marginally) the easiest RO to get all outcomes for (Do note that Damien, Joy, and Dahlia are also almost just as easy)
* Of Milo's Exclusive outcomes (Anywhere + Solo location events), we get the following:
   * 6 Smarts
   * 6 Bold
   * 10 Creative
   * 5 Charm
   * 9 Fun
* If we add the Date and Special events, it looks like this breakdown:
   * 9 Smarts (+3)
   * 7 Bold (+1)
   * 14 Creative (+4)
   * 7 Charm (+2)
   * 14 Fun (+5)
* Added altogether with the group events, we get:
   * 22 Smarts (+13)
   * 16 Bold (+9)
   * 27 Creative (+13)
   * 18 Charm (+11)
   * 24 Fun (+10)
* No matter which way you slice it, despite Charm being an EQUAL primary stat to Creative, it is used half as much as Fun, the clear and away ""secondary"" stat.  When doing runs with Milo, players should be keen to be mindful of getting their charm high, while also being mindful of how their stats line up with FUN and/or CREATIVE
* Milo has 14x zonefails, but 12 of them are in group events.
   * Of their 2x solo location zonefails, BOTH are located at the HQ (Creative)
* Milo's ""Anywhere"" Events (Not tied to Flodge/Weaving/Pappas) follow a general theme of being their tag-along for reaping the souls of several Merkingdom advisors that have recently been executed by the King, who has gone mad with paranoia (thanks to a set of elaborate pranks that have been orchestrated by the usual suspects, Polly and Scott), plus one unique event where Milo asks Scott to respectfully stop calling them ""bro"".
* One of the common running gags that is used around Milo is their addiction to their phone, as well as the constant need for validation on social media.  Additionally, if I had a nickel for every time this game mentions how easy it is for an Influencer to borrow a Ferrari...
* To be fair, Milo's ""influencer"" attitude sorta does rub me in the wrong way that Miranda did in the previous game.  Maybe it's the part that being an influencer is (in a sense) ""weaponized popularity"", and has a lot of parasocial issues that can arise from it, or the irony of trying to be ""authentic"" for the 'Gram, but ONLY if it's something popular or trendy.  I do appreciate that they are doing their best to be mindful of the great responsibility that (for good or ill) is thrust onto them when they step into the limelight, so that's a major step up compared to, say, Miri.  Considering that Milo is a Hitchhiker AND has a good ""Break"" scene in Roadtrip (and becomes one of the Playable Characters in MonCon), I'll do a further breakdown when I get to that section of the next game.
* Overall, Milo is probably my least favorite of the 6, but that's like saying Milo's my least favorite Queen album (and I like ALL the albums)

# There are 5x achievements that can be done on Milo's routes:

* **""Going Fancy""** happens with Option 2S of 152: MonetizeCampDome (Note that this outcome will override all game cosmetic customization until you close out and restart the game.  This effect WILL keep carrying forward through runs) (*Can also be done on Calculester and Dahlia Routes)*
* *""***Welcome to the Pizza Dimension""** happens on Option 2 (Creative) of 172: NotMyPizza, or Option1 (Creative) of 119: InterdimensionalPizza (*can also be done on Joy's routes for both, or Calculester's route for 119)*
* **""Interdimensional Squad""** happens on Option 2 (Bold) of 119: InterdimensionalPizza (success/fail is irrelevant)(*can also happen on Joy's or Calculester's routes)*
* ""**Nostradamus Defiant""** happens by FAILING option 1 (Smarts lower than Creative) in HQ event 154: HowtoPredictWeather, yet still succeeding at getting a date to the Meteor Shower (*Can be done on Joy's Route as well).* This is one of the few acheivements that can be overlooked when doing a full outcomes playthrough. 
* *""***THIS CAT IS THE CAT""** happens when getting all 6 of the success options of Milo's Flask Genie Plotline

# Since I didn't mention this in the last post, Aaravi only has 3x achievements tied to her routes:

* **""Why Not All""** \- Getting all three Bagel Dungeon endings (at 5x events total and 3x as many ""Success"" outcomes, this is the hardest of all the RNG plotlines to finish off)
* **""Turnip Boyfriend""**\- Option2 (FUN) of 44. RPG\_Sidequests (An ""Anywhere"" event for Aaravi)
* ""**Congratz on Being Impatient""** \- done by Failing Aaravi's 2nd event in her Flask Genie Plotline, which is only failed by hitting the ""Skip"" button exclusive to this event when the Great Old Owl loredumps aggresively (Rapidly alternating between Spacebar and left click is a better alternative that will flash through the dialogue without hitting the skip button, btw.  How else do you think I fly through already seen events/outcomes?)

# N: Let's talk the two drinks you finished off.  What's up with the Pizza and the Blender Smoothie? And why is it significant?

Simply put, BOTH these drinks can only be had on the SECOND batch of drinks, which means you ONLY get 2x turns to finish a plotline.  Count the number of events, and you'll see that these plotlines have either 6 (Pizza) or 8 (Blender) events each!

# N: Does that mean getting the correct event is RANDOM?? 

Yep!

# N: Does that mean you'll have had to do a BUNCH of runs to get everything? 

Yes and No.  For Sadie the Pizza girl, absolutely I had to do MANY runs, which I did on the side when I was farming Milo's failures/successes in 4P games (just assign one of the PCs to take the pizza drink on the second batch, and at least get 2x failures or 2x successes.)  This took multiple attempts to get everything (the Camp Rival Camp encounter was the least likely event to proc for me).  In a PERFECT RNG world, you can get all of Sadie's outcomes done in 12 runs.  In reality, it'll take probably close to 20 runs. (*Note that getting at least 1x success in all 6 events scores you the* ""**Pizza Forever""** *achievement*) 

For the Blender Smoothie, this drink effects EVERY player that's NOT currently in a secret plotline, so as long as nobody picks up a secret plotline (pretty easy to do if you have all players go after the same RO), you can get ALL 8 events to show up in a single 4-Player run (you can get every outcome within 4 runs this way).  (*Note that just drinking the blender smoothie will get you the* **""HandyPerson""** *Achievement*.)

# N: Nice! Let's see, we went over Milo...you talked about the Pizza and Blender...ah, yes! You had a few Strategy breakthroughs?

YEAH!  TWO THINGS

Turns out, you CAN get ALL 3 DATE events to proc in the same run!  As long as you play your cards right, and make use of the Love Potion to go to the player that didn't get to sit with the RO at night, you CAN get all three Date events (FOR THE SAME RO) to trigger, removing the need for RNG to get the right date event.  This CAN be done in a 3-4 Player Short game!

My theory that 4-Player long game for farming location outcomes is wrong.  To maximize the likelihood of extracting the correct event in a run, I need to have BOTH the most number of turns at ONE site, as well as the most number of turns OVERALL to remove ""anywhere"" events from the pool.  I had failed to notice that 2P has three mode lengths:

Short 2P (2 weeks window; one log/drink event)

4x turns per player (aka only 4x at one location), max 16 events in 4P

Medium 2P (3 week window; identical to Long 3-4P runs)

6x turns per player, 12x events overall; 24x in 4P

Long 2P (5 week window; identical to LONG SP runs)

10x turns per player, 20x events overall.

It doesn't seem like Long 2P and Long 4P have much variance (only 4x event difference between the two), but 2P is able to penetrate 66% deeper into a location's event pool compared to 4P, which is WORTH the trade-off of having 4 less events to pull out the ""anywhere"" events.  While that is One less drink to throw a ""Bone hurting Juice"" or a ""Tequila Moonrise"" at to influence stats, I think the pros highly outweigh the cons of me switching to 2P long games for outcome farming (...that is, when I'm NOT also farming drink outcomes)

That's it for this post! Tune back in next time, when I delve into returning 2nd Term Computer, Calculester! Calc has the most exhaustive Flask Genie plotline, having 8x different outcomes, so I'm going to pair it with ANOTHER plotline with 8x outcomes, ULTIMATE GOSSIP!  As usual, your feedback and comments give me the strength I need to power through this undertaking! Until next time! ",11,1771278020.0,MonsterProm,0,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1r6mn3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fredstester/comments/1r6mn3w/how_a_roman_legionary_shant_be_armed_back_for/,How a Roman legionary shan’t be armed – back for blood,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BRnGGv_p9A 

To celebrate regaining enough muscle control to drink without a straw after having half my face paralyzed, a drink along is in order. Today's header is round two with Alex’s channel and the lies of reenactors, so lets begin. 

0:24: Drink. The pattern of tunic is wrong here featuring sewn on sleeves. Roman tunics of this period were made from one length of material, doubled over and partially sewn up the sides with finally a slit made for the neck. 

0:30: Here we can see the tunic is made from cotton twill, something limited to Aegypt being uncommon and expensive outside it. This should be wool or linen instead. 

0:32: For some reason we’ve legionaries from later than the stated period. Drink. 

0:55: A train wreck of a subarmalis. The cotton twill makes a return instead of plain weave linen. The metal eyelets are a modern invention and should have been sewn over at the bare minimum to disguise them; proper eyelets should be sewn and, unlike the ones here falling out of the fabric, are much more sturdy. Pteruges are also for centurions and above with no evidence for use by common soldiers. Take two drinks. 

1:20: Tunic is hemmed, another sign of improper construction. Only the neck and bottom edge need hemming, the sides should hold up due to being the selvedge side. 

1:40: This predates the Victorians by a few centuries with Just Lips’s 1596 *De Militia Romana* being the first known instance of but likely dates even earlier due to Lips’s casual use. For once you can’t blame the Victorians; drink. 

2:00: Got his plates overlapping wrong with the girth hoop over the chest one. 

2:15: Those time travelling legionaries again. Drink. 

2:25: A full example was unearthed back in 2018 making this reconstruction wrong as a kalkriesse type with the shoulders being of notably different construction to later forms and with all the girth hoops being buckled unlike later forms. Drink. 

2:38: The manica shown here is worn wrong covering the outer arm rather than being over the forward side, the plates however overlap correctly unlike many examples. Half a drink. 

2:40: The manica was not adopted due to the Dacian wars with finds from forts in Britannia (from this century) predating it. This is just outdated information; drink. 

2:59: The hook on the segmentata is nothing but a reenactorism so the belt doesn’t slide down. Drink. 

3:20: I’ve said it once, I’ve said it thousand times, the gladius was not a thrust only weapon. Drink. 

4:10: Says pugio but shows the gladius for some reason. 

4:18: I was ready to rail this one for making no mention of an arming cap or similar but one of the comments by Alex stated there was a liner, something correct and in line with the finds from Vindonissa. Drink a cup of coffee instead. 

4:25: Germanic? I think Walter Goffart just rolled over in his grave again… Anyhow this is very clearly a Gallic in origin helmet with multiple finds from the 1^st C BCE all from Gaul. It should also be noted that the Romans were already using a similar helmet in the form of the Montefortino and Coolus type jobs. Drink twice. 

4:30: Should be *Imperial* Gallic if you’re using Robinson’s typology. 

4:50: This is almost as bad as the subarmalis. The edging here should be copper alloy, evidence for **rawhide** would only come with the much later Dura Europos jobs and finds at this juncture are quite common for copper alloy edging; tanned leather edging has not evidence for use. The leather here is a shit job too, being lazily tacked in place with nails and not sewn which would at least be partly redeemable. Drink twice to spoiling an otherwise good shield. 

5:00: Sources say punch, not plough, there’s a big difference. Drink. 

5:10: The foot strike is valid but gamey in anything but a one on one fight as it leaves the upper body exposed. 

5:25: Sources for shield decoration come from depictions on Trajan’s column, provincial sculptures and legionary tombstones giving some idea of unit blazons. Drink. 

5:30: Bulls as army symbols at this juncture were most prominently tied to Julius Caesar with evidence for Mithraism is largely absent in the Roman world until the last quarter of the 1^st C, making the claim here of a legionary in 43 CE being influenced by this quite questionable. Drink. 

6:10: Arm and leg protection saw varying levels of use dependent upon the individual soldier’s preferences and budget; anything they bought they’d have to lug on march and maintain making for extra work.  

6:19: The Pompeii type gladius shown here *was* short, short even for a gladius with the shortest being the same length as the longest pugios. Other types were longer but not this. Drink. 

6:30: This was roughly the juncture where the spatha comes in as the Mainz type gladius was too short for use on horseback. It’s certainly concurrent with the Pompeii type gladius at the bare minimum. 

6:58: The Roman formation was not that close, and if nothing else they managed it with longer spatha from that side later on when formations do become closer. Drink. 

7:15: The Pompeii type gladius is from the latter end of this century and is anachronistic as this juncture. Drink. 

7:25: What happened to that wide blade claim? 

7:40: The Pompeii type lasted roughly a century before being replaced at the end of the 2^nd C; definitely not centuries of use. Drink. 

_____

So the end result (beyond inebriation) is something that looks historical at a glance but becomes riddled with anachronisms when properly looked at. This is something that seems to sum up Alex’s content, with him taking reenactors at their word despite questionable reconstructions and “facts” leading to a slippery kind of anachronism, the one where there’s just enough of a patina of truth to mask the misinformation within.",1,1771277549.0,Fredstester,1,1.0,False

# About me / Training:

35M. Started running in April of 24', only recorded 6 other runs that year, then got more serious about it in 2025.  
PRs:  
\- 5K: 22:13  
\- 10K: 44:14  
\- Half: 1:47:26

Living in Phoenix, my training through the summer consistent mostly of indoor treadmill runs, which are such a mental challenge for myself. The goal was to not regress any of the spring progress and to be able to pick back up in the fall. Between the end of September 25' and early November, we ran a handful of local 5 and 10Ks, then signed up for the inaugural Garmin Half Marathon mid-November. Immediately after that, we signed up for the Lost Dutchman Marathon and I jumped into Hal's Novice 2 plan.

I knew I was going to be ramping up my weekly milage quickly, but had been feeling really good up to this point. I place hockey a few times a week and would consider myself to have a decent cardio baseline (foreshadowing).

I signed up for the Phoenix Half Marathon in mid-December, as it aligned with a shorter long run on my schedule that weekend. I told myself I would take it easy, and I really enjoy the aspect of getting to run through the city on roads and paths not normally available, so I went for it. Being new to running still, I was in that early ramp up phase, were improvements seem to come easier and I would catch myself trying to PR every single event, which I understand isn't sustainable, but my ego got the best of me during the half and I pushed further than I probably should have. I finished the race with a new PR, but in the days and weeks following, started to develop a pretty bad pain on the inside of the left lower shin. I continued to push through it, making it to my 18 mile long run at the end of December.

At this point, I was fairly certain it was a shin splint based on everything I read. It would persist for a few few days following a run, but oddly enough, after the first mile or two of running, would go away. I instantly backed off the training plan and focused on stretching, scraping, compression boots... anything that I thought might help.  I didn't run in January until the last week, testing it out by doing a 5K. The pain wasn't as bad, but still noticeable almost right afterwards. I went to an Ortho for an X-Ray, which didn't show anything, but apparently it's common for stress fractures not to show up without an MRI.

At this point the marathon was just over a week away. I continued to do as much ""rehab"" as possible, went for another 5 mile run and decided to still go for it.

During training, up to the 18 mile long run, I usually held a 9:00 to 9:30 pace and felt that at that speed, I could go for a good bit longer when the time came. I never hit a wall or felt like my runs were pushing too hard.

# Pre-race

The race had an off-site parking location. From there, the 5K, 10K and Halfers were bussed to the adjacent park to their start and finish line. All of those races were an out and back. The marathoners were bussed in the opposite direction for a point to point race, which I appreciated. First marathon shuttle was at 4:30 and last was 5:45 with a 7:00 start time. I hate the anxiety of running late, so for as much as I didn't want to sit at the startling line for 2 hours, I woke up at 3am and we were out the door around 4:15.

My digestive system is pretty slow and finicky, so I had an early dinner the night (5pm) before with some familiar foods and continued to hydrate. Up to this point, I have always struggled running or playing hockey with anything in my stomach, so I had a protein bar and stinger waffle on the bus and while waiting at the starting line. I know this is on the light side, but up until this point, it had always been enough.

The bus ride up was probably 20-25 minutes long and they heat was blasting and it was so hot on the bus ride that I was starting to sweat and feel a bit gross. The weather was a bit warmer this week than I would've like, with the low being 53 and the high being 78.

Once there, they had probably 50 small fires at the starting line, with mats to sit, lay or stretch on around each fire. The club had snack, coffee, water and more available as we waited. Plenty of porta potties and even an extra bus if you didn't get cooked enough on the way up. I sat by the fire, but quickly stripped off the sweats I was wearing.

The website had said that only the half would have pacers, but to my enjoyment, there was a 4:00 and 4:30 pacer lined up at the start for us. I decided to latch onto the 4:00 pacer since 9:09/mi was in my comfort zone.

# Race

The race started on just under 6 miles of groomed dirt road. They did water it, so it wasn't dusty at all. Some sections were pretty wash boarded and at this point, it was still crowded enough that it was hard to navigate around those areas, but started the race feeling really good overall. The first 8 miles had about 500 feet of drop in them (the total race was \~500' of decent), but there were a lot of small ups and downs within that drop overall. Around mile 3 and 4, I noticed that my heart rate was higher than expected for the this point in the race, but attributed it to the excitement of the race and the bit of rolling up and down hill sections. I continued to focus on breathing and trying to lower my effort a bit on the steeper sections.

I grew up in this area, so I really enjoyed the race going through areas I was familiar with. Again, I enjoy getting to run through these areas not normally accessible, so that was super fun. I set my watch to 45 minute alerts for fueling, but missed the first one and took my first Honey Stinger Gel at about 55 minutes.

Around mile 10, we were slowly making our way up the next long incline (an Arizona incline, probably flat for the rest of you). At this point I was in the mid 160's for average heart rate, which has been steadily increasing up to this point. Mile 13 to 14 was a pretty steep downhill section that didn't feel like the break I thought it would be. Hit the halfway still feeling good though.

Around mile 15, the bottoms of my feet started to feel really hot. It wasn't a pain or major distraction, but I could feel them moving in the wrong direction.

At mile 17, I was really starting to struggle with keeping up with the 4:00 pace group. I could feel my legs growing tired, and was starting to feel less planted. At this point my HR was in the mid 170's and I knew this pace wasn't sustainable. I started to negotiate with myself and ultimately backed off to about a 10:30 pace. I really struggled mentally with watching that group pull away from me, but again, I knew finishing the race was more important than trying to hang with them any longer.

I maintained my fueling schedule, but my water intake was starting to climb as well. I carry a pack with me, so I had plenty of water at my disposal, which probably started to work against me. I diligently hydrated the week up the run, but around mile 20, I felt like I couldn't drink enough water, but my stomach was not a fan.

At mile 21 walked one of the aid stations. There's nothing wrong with walking, and I know this, but it was the first time during a race or training run that I had to, and it was another big mental blow. I still had over 5 miles to go, it felt like it was 100 degrees outside and my thighs were officially on fire. I continued to fuel (took a total of 6 gels over the race) and drank alternating Gatorade and water from the stations.

At one point, we had to run past the auxiliary parking lot on our way to finish line. I could see my truck parked over there. I don't think I've ever thought about quitting so seriously than in that moment. Between miles 21 and 26, I walked 10 times, for a total of 14 minutes.

The crowd coming around the last turn was doing a great job and I was able to pull from some deep down reserve and keep running. Being able to see the finish line was glorious.

Finished with a chip time of 4:14:58.

# Post-race

It was definitely a sea of emotions, I was super happy I finished not only my first marathon, but still came in at a sub 4:30. I did have to battle some disappointed (unfounded or not) about hitting a few different walls and falling off my pace, but overall, I'm very happy.

On the drive home, I just wanted water. I still felt like I couldn't get enough of it, but didn't want to make myself sick. Even once home, post shower, I still felt ick from my stomach more than anything physical from my feet or legs. After some rest, more fluids and a meal, I started to come around and feel better. I lost one toe nail during training and I think I'll likely lose 3 or 4 more now. Putting my work boots on this morning was brutal.

I'm looking forward to the next one, probably at the end of the year now, but I won't underestimate finishing the training plan by thinking I'll be able to power through it. I also think I need to reevaluate my fueling plan, as I don't think it was sufficient.

Overall, it was humbling as hell. A whole new respect for you guys.

Was standing with my friend after a talk; he was speaking to a lecturer, then she approaches out of the corner of my eye, stands very close to me (elbows almost touching) and we both stand in silence for 2 mins waiting for the lecturer to be ready. She checks her phone briefly but apart from that we just stand there. She’s very bubbly and chatty, nearly always see her talking to people; not sure what to make of the silence. 

When the lecturer starts talking to us, she is chatty again, but only makes eye contact with the lecturer and my friend, despite being closest to me and having space to move into ahead of her to get closer to the lecturer.

I leave with my friend, she goes back to the classroom to get her bag. Tell my friend I’m gonna go study in the lab; while we’re talking, she passes us out heading through the corridor. When I say goodbye to my friend, she’s turned around and smiles quite sheepishly saying that she thinks she’s left her coffee at home and is gonna check the classroom, but that she’ll see me in the lab (I only told my friend I was going to the lab). She said this part more confidently than the coffee part. 

In the lab, I sit down, 30 seconds later she comes up smiling, no coffee, on my side of the room despite an empty lab. I say “that’s devastating” jokingly, ask why she can’t order one in the cafe and she says she has to have oat milk. I say “oh you’re one of THOSE”, she chuckles, sits down on the chair behind me (her back now to me), and we both study. When I get up, she (with no earphones) looks up and says bye before I do.

What do you make of this? I did sense some possible interest but she is very bubbly and social; never really assumed she’d like me. I thought she would talk to me more overall if she was interested? ",1,1771277503.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

My questions are: am I freaking out worrying about this thing? Is it likely that she has a boyfriend and she was just nice with me?

On the surface everything seems fine — I work as a waitress in a small bar in my city. I’m actually really friendly, but I’m pretty quiet with strangers, it’s hard for me to open up, even though a lot of people try to get to know me. But that’s not really the point.

Since I’m a foreigner here, I meet people from all kinds of backgrounds. So I met this guy from Albania. We texted for a while, and one day we decided to grab coffee. Of course, I didn’t tell him where I live — that’s important. The evening was going well: we had dinner, talked, everything seemed normal. Later I asked him to drive me home. He said yes — but “to his place.” I hadn’t planned on sleeping with him, so I told him it was too soon and tried to explain calmly.

And guess what? He slapped me.

On top of that, I was about 60 kilometers away from home and had no idea what to do. We started arguing just because I didn’t want to have sex. Then I decided to act crazy — I figured maybe it would throw him off. I started barking and howling like a dog, and it actually scared him. Somehow after that I managed to convince him to take me back and drop me off where he picked me up… but instead he drove me straight to my building.

Later I found out that he and his friends had been watching me for about six months. He knows everything about me, even though before all this we had never even spoken. And it’s still happening.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1r6mfvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r6mfvb/interest_or_bubbliness/,Interest or bubbliness?,"This girl has been in my college class 2 years, we get on well but limited interactions. Was standing with my friend after a talk; he was speaking to a lecturer, then she approaches out of the corner of my eye, stands very close to me (elbows almost touching) and we both stand in silence for 2 mins waiting for the lecturer to be ready. She checks her phone briefly but apart from that we just stand there. She’s very bubbly and chatty, nearly always see her talking to people; not sure what to make of the silence. 

When the lecturer starts talking to us, she is chatty again, but only makes eye contact with the lecturer and my friend, despite being closest to me and having space to move into ahead of her to get closer to the lecturer.

I leave with my friend, she goes back to the classroom to get her bag. Tell my friend I’m gonna go study in the lab; while we’re talking, she passes us out heading through the corridor. When I say goodbye to my friend, she’s turned around and smiles quite sheepishly saying that she thinks she’s left her coffee at home and is gonna check the classroom, but that she’ll see me in the lab (I only told my friend I was going to the lab). She said this part more confidently than the coffee part. 

In the lab, I sit down, 30 seconds later she comes up smiling, no coffee, on my side of the room despite an empty lab. I say “that’s devastating” jokingly, ask why she can’t order one in the cafe and she says she has to have oat milk. I say “oh you’re one of THOSE”, she chuckles, sits down on the chair behind me (her back now to me), and we both study. When I get up, she (with no earphones) looks up and says bye before I do.

What do you make of this? I did sense some possible interest but she is very bubbly and social; never really assumed she’d like me. I thought she would talk to me more overall if she was interested? ",1,1771277090.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.

Fortunately, I didn't spend time on the bench and project was assigned to me in a couple days, but my team is scattered across India, none being in Pune.

I try networking with my team by having virtual coffee breaks but none are interested and I get the feeling they don't want to interact with me. 

I try talking to people in the office but wow, people just don't wanna reciprocate. I mean what's the point of RTO and that too choosing a different city when my team connect virtually.

Yes I do know people don't owe me interaction, but I'm here making an effort and have been brushed aside by everyone.

I had an offer from Deloitte India with Mumbai as the base location, but the pay was significantly less, now I'm feeling I made the wrong choice? Maybe I'm overthinking, plan to give it 6 months else plan on leaving.

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

i dont like acidity much and i want to try a flat bottom brewer. i tried at a very good coffee shop an orea brew and it tasted really good imo.

  
my current options are:

* timemore b75
* [timemore portable brewer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DTY13RZ1?smid=A3NHIMUST941YG&psc=1) 
* fake orea from aliexpress. literally impossible to get a real orea in my country without spending like 110$ total for one, which imo is absolutely not worth it.
* real origami from their website. most likely the orange air in S size.



also my options for filter papers are:

* origami wave filters (2 cup)
* original? kalita wave 155 filters on aliexpress
* timemore b75 filters from a reputable aliexpress seller
* free pack of 10? papers that come with the timemore portable brewer



i brew mainly darker light roast that has heavier notes.

im wondering which of these drippers is going to complement well the coffees i like to make.

i struggle to pick out notes, but enjoy soft coffee without much of a bite and without much acidity. i like berry notes and nutty notes, and not very funky coffees or ones that have prominent fermentation flavors.

i know this is an info dump but im a very indecisive person and need help deciding.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1r6marr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r6marr/silvia_over_gcp_worth_the_expense_600eu/,Silvia over GCP - worth the expense? [600eu],"Hey there, 

I am looking for guidance on my choice for a single boiler espresso machine to be used in a workspace. The setting is as follows: 

\- Hospital NICU meaning the machine would be left running 24/7, approximately 15-20 shots per 24h to be expected.

\- Mainly espresso shots, much less  milk steaming (hence no need for dualboiler/HX)

\- Maintenance would be done by a group of colleagues who all own ""larger"" machines at home and would be dedicated to keeping the machine running

\- Simple to use for less experienced colleages (so ideally just push one switch to pull a shot)

\- To be combined with a Eureka Mignon MCI grinder



So far we had discussed the usual suspects:

\- Sage The Bambino Plus (pro: Thermocoil => fast heatup, would not have to run 24/7, volume automatics for less experienced users, auto steaming as a gimmick, con: plastics, electronics, questionable longevity for this setting)

\- Lelit Anna: Small, solid for what its worth, no added gimmicks, yet missing experience on build quality on our side.

\- GCP E24: Solid build quality, abundance of replacement parts, 58mm portafilter, fitting the spare equipment most of us have at home and can bring to work, ability to upgrade usinge a gaggimate later on. 

By now we have set our eyes on the GCP ... but: 

Whenever I search for reviews of the GCP the Silvia always gets mentioned and I just cant get it out of my head - I love that machine. 

The Silvia was my first love and I still think of her even though I am quite happy with my newer Setups but.... as we all know, the first love always sticks. The Silvia is built like a tank, reliable, every single screw can be easily found online and be replaced and it produces great coffee while also being moddable just like the GCP. While it does have rust issues, there are 3d printed models who claim to fix the issue of sprinkling from the 3-way-valve.... but is it worth it? 

The machine would cost roughly 100-150eu more than a GCP and if it were my money I wouldn't hesitate for a second to just get the Silvia but I also dont want to waste my colleagues money on my emotional dependence on this machine.

So please advise me - is the silvia worth the additional 100-150 euros compared to the GCP? Most of the arguments for the silvia could just as well be made for the GCP, yet especially in this special setting (Running 24/7, lots of shots being pulled each day) endurance and reliability are the most importand factors and these are what I believe where the silvia excels at... or am I being biased?",1,1771276773.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

6 dashes in a single character, one of which doubles as a boop because god forbid you successfully get up close and personal with the abomination, while another nullify all further attempts at engaging because it's also a stun. Did I mention he can chose the direction of the parry, in case he really doesn't feel like fighting you? 

3 dashes in a single spell, who deals very decent damages early and are impossible to dodge because the range on those things might as well be the size of Texas. And if that wasn't enough he can change the direction mid swing, so yeah, screw you if you're in his line of sight because there's no way you're dodging that shit. Oh yeah, little detail, it also heals him, because it clearly didn't do enough.

His ult's range is the single most hilarious shit I've ever witnessed. Oh you thought you were safe because you were two screens away? Nice one mate, but Zoro over here doesn't feel like it's enough so you're gonna die.

And it's not like you see it one game every blue moon either : since he dropped, I've had like three games without him. And whether he is on my team or the other, it sucks because he overshadows everything else, and that's neither fun to play with or against. 

Side rant :

While all of this bullshit happens, you have Silver who's human form sucks (so she's cannot really do shit before ult), who's ult has to be charged mid fight (but will still pop when you don't want it too if you've successfully charged it a little too late), her dash connects whenever it feels like it, her bolas are hilariously weak, her human dash cannot even be aimed upward, her weapon does nothing past 3 meters and even then, you could go and make coffee between two shots...

Conclusion :

So yeah, I know it's not work, you don't have to announce when you're leaving, but I wanted to make that post because I wanted to know something : am I the only one frustrated to no ends whenever I see him appaer in my games? Or is it just a fat skill issue? ",0,1771276681.0,DeadlockTheGame,15,0.45,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

We met on Grindr. It was supposed to be just fun. Just sex. Just something casual. I wasn’t even out. I didn’t want a boyfriend. I told myself I wasn’t ready for that kind of vulnerability.

And then I met him.

Somehow “just fun” turned into four months of seeing each other almost every single day. I drove him everywhere. I paid for almost everything. I didn’t mind — he’s a student, I work, I earn well. It felt natural. I wanted to take care of him. I wanted to be someone solid in his life.

We weren’t just hooking up. We were making love. We talked for hours. We were constantly texting. I felt seen. I felt chosen. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could imagine building something real — even though I was still closeted.

When I was home, I felt secure.

When I went back to work offshore, something changed.

The distance started eating at me. Communication dipped. My anxiety grew. I went on Grindr myself. Not to cheat — but maybe to feel control, maybe to test something, maybe because I was already scared of losing him.

Then a guy I hooked up with later (after breakup) casually told me something that shattered me: that my (now) ex boyfriend had gone to his place after coffee, given him head for 10 minutes, and left.

They had history before me. That detail made it worse.

I confronted him. He denied being on Grindr. I told him I had proof. He blocked me.

After that, it was a slow emotional death.

I tried to talk. I asked to meet. I told him I was willing to take responsibility for my part. I told him I was ready to change how I approached things. I told him I just wanted to sit down like two adults and talk.

He said he had no will.

He said there was nothing to talk about.

He said he lost the energy.

I spiraled.

I sent too many messages. I called. I said “I need you.” I even told him to block me if it was truly over because I didn’t have the strength to stop.

And the worst part? He didn’t fight. Not even a little.

Then I did something I’m not proud of. I made a fake Grindr account.

And there he was.

Sending nudes.

Looking for “fun” in public bathrooms.

Acting like none of this existed.

While I’m here barely sleeping, replaying our memories, looking at his photos and feeling both warmth and grief at the same time.

I keep staring at his eyes in pictures because I swear he loved me. I saw it. It was real.

And yet now I’m watching myself beg for someone who won’t even meet me for coffee.

I don’t know what hurts more —

the possibility that he cheated,

or the fact that he won’t even sit down and look me in the eyes and end it properly.

I feel ashamed of how much I lowered myself.

Ashamed that I kept chasing.

Ashamed that I still want him.

Because the truth is — I do.

Even after all of this, if he called me right now and said “come over,” I probably would.

And that scares me more than losing him.

I don’t know how to let go of someone who was supposed to be just a hookup and became the first person I imagined changing my life for.

I don’t know how to accept that someone can love you — and still walk away without looking back.

If you’ve been here before… how did you survive the part where your heart wants someone your dignity knows you shouldn’t chase?",1,1771276586.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hissed.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Chapter 1

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.

Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.

I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.

I’m 23M and I’ve been living in Qatar for a while now, but most of my life here has just been work and home. I’d really like to change that and start meeting new people.

I’m a big car enthusiast and I love drift shows, night drives, and dune trips, but I’ve honestly never gone because I don’t really have anyone to go with. It would be great to find some people who are into cars or just want to explore places around Qatar together.

I’m pretty easygoing, always down for a drive, coffee, or just hanging out. If you’re also looking for friends or need one more person for your car group, feel free to reach out.",1,1771276397.0,Qatar_Meet_Friends,0,0.99,False
1r6m4gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1r6m4gz/my_limerence_story/,"My ""Limerence"" story","A few weeks ago I made a post about what I thought might be a limerence situation I was involved in:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1qp0st5/confused\_about\_what\_limerence\_actually\_means/](https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1qp0st5/confused_about_what_limerence_actually_means/)

The gist of it was that there was this woman in my neighborhood I'd gotten to know over the past half year or so, who seemed to like me, and I certainly liked her, meaning I was attracted to her, but I wasn't certain in what was she liked me. As a casual neighborly friend? As an actual friend? Romantically? It was a situation that could be interpreted in any of these ways.

In any case I'd developed a crush on her, without knowing exactly how she felt about me, which based on my limited understanding of the term sounded like it could be a limerence situation. Or not. So I asked about it, and the consensus seemed to be that it had shades of limerence but wasn't actual limerence. More like an intense crush that could turn into limerence if it turned out that she wasn't interested in me but I persisted in believing that she was, or could be.

Anyway, since then, there have been developments, that have changed my perspective and made me realize several things that hopefully will give me closure and allow me to get on with my life and put this behind me. The basis of our ""neighborly friendship"" was our running across each other outside, when I was either doing something outside my place and she walked past, or we'd pass each other elsewhere, running or walking. We'd stop, chat pleasantly, then move on.

But, after I made the previous post here, weeks went by without my seeing her, for a bunch of reasons. It got really cold and we were hit with a major snowstorm, so being outside for extended periods was a challenge, plus I hurt my back, so I was indoors most of the day. But then, last week, after things had warmed up and my back felt better, I was outside doing something and she passed by, greeting me cheerfully, and telling me about a new YouTube channel she'd just started, and have me the link along with her phone #.

Until then I didn't have her SM or contacts, so I took this as a sign that she might be interested in me after all. Attractive women generally don't give such information to men they don't like, at least outside of professional settings or if they're in some sort of club or organization. So after we chatted pleasantly and parted, and I was done with what I was working on outside, I went back in and check her YouTube account.

And it was basically short videos about her spiritual journey. Yeah, she was deeply into new age spiritualism, but until I saw these videos, I had no idea how much. We're talking way out stuff, about cosmic convergences affecting peoples' moods, resonance frequencies, spiritual awakening and rebirth, energy flows, astrology, working on self-love, and so on. Perhaps some here are into that too, and if so my apologies. But to me it's basically crazytown, an alternate reality for broken people and narcissists to indulge their deep self-love.

She had also made or was in the process of making major life changes that were in line with this ""journey"". She'd recently quit her well-paying job of nearly 20 years, and was in the process of selling her home, with the goal of moving somewhere closer to nature and less dense and oppressive (we live on the outskirts of a major city), in order to be one with nature and help and influence locals and make their lives better, but without any specific idea of where. First it was the west coast, then it was a more rural part of this state, then it was the midwest, and now it's the south. Tomorrow it may well be Hawaii.

But, blinded by my crush on her, and, I'll admit, her being gorgeous, charming and flirty, I still put this aside and told myself that it's just a phase, she'll snap out of it, she's probably getting over a really bad relationship and turned to this nonsense to heal, if she gets to know me and we hit it off she'll come back to reality, etc. Yeah, I was delusional too, I'll admit. Crushes do that to you.

I also started reading up on narcissism, and realized that many of her attributes and actions lined up with it. She loves attention, we only interacted on her terms, she spent most of the time talking about herself during our chats and rarely showed interest in me, she bragged about how many followers she had on FB, said that she saw herself as a spiritual healer, teacher and guide who want to help others but only after she first healed herself, and so on. And she kept changing her YouTube and FB head shots every few days, each one more ""sexy"" than the one before.

And there was something else. Now that I had her contact info, which she gave me just a few days before Valentine's Day, and which I thought may have been a hint, I asked her out, on the day itself. Nothing major, just a walk to and around a local park, since we both like nature and she's really into walking, and maybe a coffee afterwards. She turned me down. Nicely, but definitively, with no ""Oh that sounds nice but I'm busy, but I'd love to do something soon!"". Just thanks but no. Pretty clear not interested signal I'd say.

And yet, astoundingly, all of this was not enough to convince me that there was nothing there, and even if there was, it would be a mistake because of the new age stuff and narcissism (plus she was a pretty serious vegan who didn't just practice it but preached it online, and I'm definitely not a vegan and never will be). Thankfully I didn't make a fool of myself by asking her out again.

But I did persist in the fantasy that there might still be something there, and kept going over various scenarios in which her turning down my invitation wasn't definitive and I might yet not only win her over, but get her to abandon her crazy new age quest. That's limerence, right? I even contacted her a few times, by leaving nice comments on her YouTube videos, and messaging her a few times. Nothing. She was polite, even friendly. But no more.

And then, today, it just hit me. First and foremost, she's just not into me, and I have to just accept that. It's blindingly clear. In fact I'm not sure she even wants to be more than casual neighborly friends. What I think she sees in me is a ready audience for her need for attention and validation (narcissism), and another social media follower for her new age influencer career, and perhaps a recruit to it (also narcissistic). And second, the new age kookiness, the militant veganism, the apparent narcissism. Even if she was into me, it would never have worked out, or been satisfying.

I don't know what made me suddenly realize this today. Everything just sort of clicked and a light bulb went off. Of course it was after days of ruminating and fantasizing over this and discussing it with others, so perhaps that finally got this out of my system. Isn't that how limerence is sometimes ""cured"", that one day you just realize that it's just a fantasy and always was, and you're over it, or on the way to being over it? But I no longer feel like I have to be outside in case she passes by, or message her, or look at her YouTube videos and comment on them. I feel released from this madness. And it was a kind of madness.

Does this make sense? Is this how it works? I'm not saying that I'm totally over her, and this. There will likely be relapses. But I feel like the dam has broken and I'm ""free"" of the worst of it now, and I can see the reality of the situation and not my projected fantasy version of it.",3,1771276381.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

Dear Lord, I take this moment to reflect on all the gifts you’ve given me. Because it is too often neglected. Taken for granted. Often, we fall into a trap of spiritual denial.

I'm a loner, Dottie. A rebel.","TL;DR: Internet-addicted PC gamer seeks someone to talk to about video games and other very important topics.

I'm a grown man that is living out his childhood dreams of sitting around playing video games all day. Since I was a child that's really what I've wanted to do, the only difference between my childhood fantasies and my current reality is that I didn't want to be alone while I did this.

In my dating history I've always found the most important part of a relationship to me is the conversation. There's a certain flow that good conversationalists have that other people just don't. An ability to flow with the topics, to interject comedy, to take a piece of something and spin it into something else, some people just get it but a lot of people do not.

I'm looking for someone who can mock any topic while also mocking the person they're talking to and mocking themselves, much like Statler and Waldorf on The Muppets.

Conversation flow is enough for even people with nothing in common to get along for a few days, but for something a bit more lasting I think you need more compatibility.

With that in mind the rest of this ad is gonna be ranting about myself to help you establish if you think we might have similar tastes and mentalities.

Positive Traits:

- I'm intelligent enough to not feel immodest or arrogant saying I'm intelligent.

- If we're on the same wavelength I'm hilarious. If we are not on the same wavelength I am probably disturbing and awkward.

- Overly honest. Everyone lies, myself included, but I make a conscious effort to minimize it and not abuse my powers for evil.

- Loyal. I'm someone who likes an extremely small social circle so I tend to be pretty intent on doing right by the handful of people in that circle.

- Extremely self-aware. That's what separates me from the rest of the crazies.

Hobbies:

- Gaming like my life depends on it.

- Gaming seriously.

- Gaming semi-seriously.

- Gaming casually.

- Overindulging in most other types of media, typically in the background while gaming. TV, movies, podcasts, music, YouTube rabbit holes. I try to incorporate some things with subtitles to pull me away from gaming and get me exercising as I watch anime or some other foreign media.

- Boxing, or more accurately hitting a punching bag because all other cardio is boring.

Quirks:

- I don't like driving or even being in cars. I have a car and do drive but I hate it.

- I don't like phones. I do not utilize them in my daily life, I use them primarily for GPS.

- No interest in fashion in the real world. I dress for comfort and usually am not even aware of what I am currently wearing, I grab what's at the top of the laundry pile. I do however care about fashion when it comes to my virtual avatars inside video games.

- I've smoked marijuana on and off for 25 years. Currently on.

- I've drank coffee and tea on and off for the last 25 years. Currently off.

- Apolitical...maybe anti-political?

- Areligious...maybe anti-religious?

- A love of critters. I feed the local wildlife but have no pets, just some regular visitors.

- The least military-y honorably discharged veteran. I don't like guns being anywhere near me, I don't like the government, I don't like people telling me what to do. Never shot at anyone, never got shot at, hopefully that trend continues.

- Chronic smartass, trouble turning it off even at inappropriate times.

- Popcorn brain, constant need for stimulation and thoughts that pop around. I associate things in conversation in odd ways that can often spark a desire to send a loosely connected meme, gif, or YouTube video.

- Overly logical and analytical which tends to cause pessimism, though not necessarily pessimistic by default.

- I avoid saturated fat, sugar and salt so my diet is extremely dull.

- I send a lot of random videos. https://youtu.be/eVkWhnaILl8?si=UHpw-hVlh9yEnXBd

Red Flags:

- 5'6""

- Rarely leaves the house. Not agoraphobic, just apathetic about the outside world.

- Divorced for nearly a decade. No kids.

- Lack of real world ambition. Endless ambition to conquer virtual worlds. Seeing a theme yet?

- Lazy in the real world. Hardworking in virtual worlds.

- A complete disconnect from world events to a stubborn degree.

- A general disdain for humanity.

- Inconsistent use of the Oxford comma. Overuse of normal commas and ellipsiseses. I also use ""it's"" for both the possessive and conjunction.

- Tend to act like and sound like I know what I'm talking about even when I most certainly don't.

So that's who I am, message me and let me know who you are.

He would say things like “if I met you earlier my life would look different” and once even joked that we should get drinks but “off the record.” I asked him directly if he was seeing anyone and he said it was complicated and he was basically single.



Yesterday another coworker mentioned his fiancée by name in casual conversation. I thought it was a joke. It was not. Apparently they’ve been engaged for almost a year and planning a wedding.



I feel stupid. I feel embarrassed. I replay every conversation wondering if I was delusional.

Do I just back away and pretend none of it happened.

I remember how intense and night and day it was once I did start it, but I'm guessing it's not supposed to be that amped up all the time. Also I'm finding that I'm heavily reliant on food and topping up my energy levels elsewhere, when previously I would've just burned through the day on coffee, which obviously I can't do.

I need to type this out because I don't know who else to tell. My wife thinks I'm losing it. Maybe I am. But I know what I saw, and I need someone—anyone—to tell me I'm not crazy.

My daughter Lily is six. She's in that phase where she draws everything. The dog, her teacher, our house—you name it. The fridge is wallpapered in crayon. I love it. Every stick figure with its wild spaghetti hair makes me smile. That's what dads do. We stick the pictures up and we tell them it's beautiful, and we mean it.

Three weeks ago, Lily handed me a drawing of our house. It was good, for a six-year-old. She got the color right—that faded blue vinyl siding we keep saying we'll replace. She drew the red front door, the two big windows on the first floor, the two on the second floor, and the little round attic vent near the peak.

Except she also drew a window on the second floor that doesn't exist.

I didn't think much of it at first. She's six. Kids add stuff. They put chimneys on ranch houses and give dogs five legs. I stuck it on the fridge with a ladybug magnet and forgot about it.

Then she drew the house again two days later. Same window. Same spot—between our bedroom and the bathroom, on the east-facing wall. In real life, that wall is just drywall on our side and siding on the outside. No window. Never has been one. I checked the original listing photos from when we bought the place in 2019. No window.

I asked her about it.

""Lily, what's this window here?""

She didn't look up from her coloring. ""That's the window where the man watches.""

I want to tell you my blood ran cold or whatever people say in these stories. It didn't. I felt annoyed. I figured one of her friends at school had been telling ghost stories again, or she'd seen something on that damn iPad when we weren't looking. Kids say creepy shit all the time. I have a buddy whose four-year-old told him ""you were nicer in your last life."" Kids are just like that.

""What man, sweetheart?""

""The man who lives in the middle.""

I asked her what ""the middle"" meant. She shrugged the way kids do when they're done talking about something. Went back to giving a dinosaur purple spots. I let it go.

I should not have let it go.



Here's some context about our house. It's a 1987 colonial in a subdivision outside Raleigh. Four bedrooms, two and a half baths, 2,400 square feet. When we moved in, the previous owners had already gutted and redone the kitchen and both bathrooms. Everything else was original—including, presumably, the layout.

The wall Lily keeps drawing the window on sits between our master bedroom and the hall bathroom. On our side, there's a dresser pushed up against it. On the bathroom side, there's the linen closet. I've never given it a second thought in five years of living here.

After the second drawing, I went upstairs and stood in the hallway. I looked at that wall. It's maybe twelve feet long, running from the bathroom door to where it meets the exterior wall. The linen closet takes up about three feet of it. Our dresser is pushed against the bedroom side and covers maybe four feet.

That leaves about five feet of wall that nothing is pushed against on either side.

I knocked on it. I don't know why. I think I expected to feel stupid and move on.

It sounded different.

Our interior walls are standard drywall over studs. You knock on them and you get that hollow thud that everyone knows. This section—the section with nothing on either side of it—didn't thud. It was deeper. Flatter. Like there was more air behind it than there should be.

I told myself it was probably just a difference in insulation. Maybe a duct ran through there. Maybe the stud spacing was wider in that section. Old houses are weird. Ours isn't even that old, but whatever. I rationalized it and moved on.

Then I went outside.

I don't know what made me do it. Some nagging part of my brain, maybe. I walked out the front door, down the driveway, and turned around to look at the east side of the house. I counted windows.

First floor: kitchen window, dining room window. Correct.

Second floor: master bedroom window, bathroom window, guest room window. Correct.

And about five feet of blank siding between the bedroom window and the bathroom window. Just vinyl. No window. No patch. No outline of anything that had ever been a window.

But I stood there staring at it, and I swear to God, the spacing was wrong.

Here's what I mean. On a house like ours, the windows are evenly distributed. They line up with the rooms behind them, and the gaps between them are proportional. But the gap between our bedroom window and the bathroom window was wider than it should have been. Not by a lot. Maybe two feet. But once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it.

Two feet isn't much on a wall. But two feet is enough for something to be between them.



I couldn't sleep that night. I lay there staring at the ceiling while my wife Sarah breathed slow and steady next to me. I kept doing math in my head. Our master bedroom is fourteen feet wide. The bathroom is eight. The hallway is three and a half. That's twenty-five and a half feet of interior space.

I got up, went downstairs, and pulled up the county property records on my laptop. The house footprint showed the second floor as thirty-one feet across on the east-west axis.

I did the math four times. Every time I got the same answer.

There were five and a half unaccounted feet in that wall.

Not two. Not a duct chase. Five and a half feet.

At 2 AM I went back upstairs with a tape measure. I measured the master bedroom wall to wall. Fourteen feet, two inches. I measured the hallway. Three feet, eight inches. I measured the bathroom. Eight feet even. I measured the guest bedroom on the other side. The thickness of interior walls accounted for roughly another ten inches total.

I was off by five feet, four inches. There was a space inside our wall that was five feet wide and I had no idea what was in it.

I pressed my ear against the drywall in the hallway, the section that sounded wrong. I held my breath. The house was dead silent—that 3 AM silence where even the refrigerator feels loud.

I didn't hear anything. I think that's what scared me the most. Because I was *listening* for something, and the silence that came back was the wrong kind. You know how you can hear the difference between an empty room and a room where someone is being very, very quiet?

It was the second kind.



The next morning, I told Sarah. She gave me that look—the one she uses when I'm on my third cup of coffee and spiraling about something I read online at 1 AM.

""Bryan, it's an old house. There's probably a plumbing chase or a mechanical shaft or something. You're going to tear our wall open because Lily drew a window?""

She wasn't wrong. Not entirely. Plumbing chases exist. HVAC shafts exist. But five feet wide? Every chase I've ever seen in a residential build is maybe sixteen to twenty inches. You don't need five feet to run some PVC and copper.

I called my buddy Marcus who does contracting work. He came by that Thursday with a stud finder and an inspection camera—one of those little borescope things you snake through a hole.

We started in the hallway. The stud finder picked up framing at normal sixteen-inch intervals across most of the wall. Then it hit a section where it went haywire. The readings were inconsistent—like there was framing, then open air, then something else, then more framing.

Marcus drilled a small hole in the drywall about four feet up. Quarter inch. Nothing structural. He fed the camera in.

He looked at the screen for maybe five seconds before he pulled back.

""What?"" I said.

He looked at me with an expression I've never seen on his face before. Marcus is a big dude, built like a linebacker, and he's been doing construction for twenty years. He's crawled through attics with rat infestations and gone under crawl spaces that smelled like something died. Nothing fazes him.

He handed me the camera without saying a word.

The screen showed a narrow space—maybe five feet wide, just like I'd calculated. It ran floor to ceiling, rough framing on either side. The camera's LED illuminated raw plywood flooring. No insulation. No pipes. No ductwork. Nothing mechanical at all.

It was just a room. A tall, narrow room sealed inside our wall. No door. No window. No access point that we could see from this angle.

But that's not why Marcus looked like that.

On the far side of the space, pushed up against what would be the exterior wall, there was a chair. A wooden chair, like a kitchen chair. It was facing the interior wall—facing toward our bedroom.

And on the plywood floor around the chair, arranged in a pattern I couldn't immediately make sense of, were dozens of small, dark objects. The camera resolution wasn't great, but I could make out shapes. They looked like little bundles. Little fabric bundles, tied with string.

""Is that—"" I started.

""We need to call someone,"" Marcus said. ""Not me. Someone else. I don't—I'm not going in there, man. I'm sorry. I can't do that.""

I didn't understand his reaction until I tilted the camera up, toward the ceiling of the space.

Scratched into the raw wood of the subfloor above—the underside of our attic floor—were tally marks. Hundreds of them. Organized in neat groups of five, covering almost the entire visible surface.

And below the tally marks, in letters that had been carved slowly, deliberately, with something sharp:

**I CAN HEAR THEM SLEEP**





I called the police. Of course I called the police. Two officers came out, and then a detective, and then more people. They opened the wall from the hallway side—cut through the drywall in a wide rectangle. The smell came first. Not rot. Not decay. It smelled stale. Like air that hadn't moved in a very long time, but also faintly sweet, in a way that made my stomach turn.

The space was exactly what the camera showed. Five feet, four inches wide. Ran the full depth of the house, about twenty-four feet front to back. Floor to ceiling. Framed out with proper studs and joists. This wasn't a gap or an oversight. Someone had built this space on purpose. It was in the original construction.

The chair was a standard wooden kitchen chair, the kind you'd buy at a yard sale for five bucks. It was positioned facing the wall shared with our bedroom. Directly on the other side of that wall was the spot where our bed's headboard sits.

The bundles on the floor were small fabric pouches, hand-stitched from what looked like old cotton. The police collected twenty-six of them. They wouldn't tell me what was inside.

I found out later from a friend at the sheriff's department. Hair. Each pouch contained a small lock of hair, tied with brown thread. Different lengths. Different colors.

Our house has had four owners since it was built in 1987. That's four families. Multiple people in each family. People who slept on the other side of that wall, never knowing.

The tally marks on the ceiling numbered over three thousand.

The detective asked me if I'd ever noticed anything unusual in the house. I said no. Then I stopped. Because that wasn't true.

I'd always wondered why our bedroom door wouldn't stay open. You had to wedge something under it or it would drift shut on its own, slowly, like the house was exhaling. We always assumed the floor was slightly uneven. Old house. Settling.

But I realized now that the floor wasn't uneven. The wall was. Five feet and four inches of hidden space will do that. The weight distribution of our second floor was asymmetric in a way that no one had ever noticed, and it pulled our bedroom door gently closed, every single time, sealing us in.

The police found one more thing that I haven't told Sarah about. On the wall facing our bedroom, at about chest height, someone had made a hole. Not a big one. Maybe the diameter of a pencil. It went clean through the framing, through the drywall, and came out behind our dresser.

I moved the dresser. The hole was there. Clean, round, and angled slightly downward.

Toward our bed.

It had been patched on our side at some point with a tiny circle of matching paint. You would never see it unless you knew where to look. I've been sleeping six feet from that hole for five years.



The police are investigating. They pulled the original building permits and are trying to track down the contractor who built the house in '87. The original owner died in 2004. The second and third owners have been contacted. No one knew about the space.

But here's the thing that keeps me up at night. The thing I keep circling back to.

Those tally marks. Over three thousand. If you assume one mark per night—and the neat, methodical grouping in fives suggests that's exactly how they were counted—that's over eight years of nights.

Our house was built in 1987. The first owners lived there from '87 to '96. Nine years.

The second owners: '96 to 2008. Twelve years.

Third owners: 2008 to 2019. Eleven years.

Us: 2019 to now. Five years.

Three thousand tally marks don't fit inside any single owner's timeline. But they could fit across several.

Which means either someone sealed themselves in that space for eight straight years—no food, no water, no door—or someone has been getting in and out without any of us ever knowing.

I've looked. I've looked everywhere. There's no hatch. No hidden door. No panel. The space is sealed. Framed, drywalled, and sealed on every side. The only opening was the pencil-width hole behind our dresser.

But the chair wasn't dusty. I keep thinking about that. The bundles on the floor were carefully placed. The tally marks were sharp, not faded.

And when they opened the wall, the air that came out was stale, yes. Old, yes.

But it was warm.



We're staying at my in-laws' place. Lily seems fine. She hasn't drawn the house since we left. I asked her one more time about the man who watches from the window.

""He's not there anymore, daddy.""

""How do you know?""

She looked at me like I'd asked the dumbest question in the world.

""Because he left when we did.""

I don't know where we're going to live. I don't know if I'll ever feel safe in a house again. But I keep thinking about those other families—the ones who slept in that bedroom for years, their heads against that wall, while someone sat in a chair on the other side and listened.

Three thousand nights. Someone counted every single one.

And I think about all the houses in our subdivision. Same builder. Same year. Same floor plan.

There are forty-six houses on our street.

I wonder how many of them have a window that isn't there.

1r6lsty,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1r6lsty/help_with_recent_diagnosis/,Help With Recent Diagnosis,"I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis twenty years ago. One of my enduring memories of the early years of that illness was that I couldn’t accurately answer the question “How are you doing?” Initially every appointment (six months between them) was “treatment isn’t working” because in my mind, I still had pain, I wasn’t back working, I didn’t feel like I used to, so that meant it wasn’t working. It took years to understand that treatment working didn’t mean I would be fine, it was as incurable as they were trying to tell me, and that hoping for 100% wasn’t realistic or possible. Eventually I learned with swimming and an effective biologic (Remicade mostly) I could be ok. Not cured, but manageable with other concessions made. 

Eight months ago I was diagnosed with Crohns after almost a year of crippling stomach pain. I’ve been on 15mg of Rinvoq daily since August. I have a critical follow-up appointment in a few weeks, and I wanted to try and learn from people with the requisite experience I don’t have so I can answer the question “how are you doing?” I don’t want a repeat of twenty years ago and be expecting 100% remission or else it’s not working. With that said, I also don’t know if where I am is what I should be accepting. Do I see my GI and demand something else/switch to 30mg or learn to accept that this is it? 

When I had my first Rinvoq follow-up in December, I expected to be moved to 30mg. I was exhausted all the time, and literally sleeping most afternoons. A lot of the time I could go back to bed before I even finished a coffee. I was shocked when my GI observed through my stool test that I had responded very well to 15mg, and that he did not want to move me to 30mg. I pushed back that I was exhausted, but he was firm, and gave me iron and B12 supplements. If things didn’t change by March, he wanted to evaluate why I wasn’t getting enough sleep, or restorative sleep. 

After having AS for twenty years, and not new to fatigue from an autoimmune disease, my instincts are telling me this is not a case of inadequate sleep. It feels like nothing I’ve dealt with previous to this past year, and I know I get plenty of sleep. I feel the more likely explanation is that this disease is under treated. 

As far as how my Crohns is, my stomach is never not an issue in the sense of feeling bloated or just being really aware of the problem. He was right that I had responded to it, because I was no longer keeling over in excruciating pain almost daily, however, things aren’t normal either. Many days I have multiple BMs that always feel incomplete. There’s also minor things that concern me, such as sitting down to pee and after passing gas there is a need to wipe. Sorry for that, but it just makes me feel like this is not right. 

So I guess my big ask is this: What is a success story with Crohns? Am I lucky to no longer be in pain all the time, or should I be expecting more relief than this? Is it normal to be exhausted ALL THE TIME even on a successful treatment? From those with experience, would going from 15mg to 30mg address the crippling fatigue or just potentially help the stomach more? 

Any advice is welcome.",1,1771275649.0,CrohnsDisease,1,1.0,False

The idea is to sit and chill and get to know each other over (some form of) drinks. 

I find it difficult to find a place that's somewhat spacious, has comfortable seating and isn't blasting music/crowded.

1r6lodt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6lodt,Whats your thoughts on the update?,"I'm not trying to flex here. I just didn't have a cinematic picture that would fit the aesthetic I was planning to go with, so I just went with a frog giving you a thumbs-up and Alasdair's Premium skin.

'Twas my prized possession back when my account was in its early days (⁠•⁠ ⁠▽⁠ ⁠•⁠;⁠) Also, I have Hilding's, by the way. Now that's a flex, HAHAHAHA

btw shout out to this redditor!

Anyway,

With the current meta revolving around item building and memorization of fettered effects, every character can finally be utilized to its fullest.

Some are better than others, but the majority of the community agrees that the game became super exciting (and kind of Unbalanced) after the update.

Obscure and unloved characters like Gerard, Hilding, Galewing, Allesia, and of course, Jadetalon are finally getting the love they so deserve. Jadetalon is a prime example of this, being recognized as one of the best one-shot kill characters in the game right now, also inflicting multiple stacks of burn in a single hit.

The update gave what obscure heroes oh so deservingly needed.

I can hear you say, ""So? Where's the issue?""

Well, the main issue I can think of is that there's a small chance that fettered effects won't trigger.

Samurai, Elven, and Godblade are the three most powerful fettered effects in the game right now, with Relic being the strongest.

However, I've had a few runs where I couldn't trigger the Elven effect even when I combined them and gained the Fairy King.

It's not just me either; there are cases where people notice their fettered effects not working. The saving grace here is that it's rare, and it can be solved by simply fusing them to obtain the Relic effect.

Another noteworthy thing I wanted to point out is that Imba makes things boring now. If you're anything like me, I love a good fight. Imba mode is the equivalent of having a 5-star Michelin steak. Good food, but you'll eventually get tired of the same meal. It becomes dull.

What you'd want is a buffet with all sorts of flavors. I could definitely go for some coffee right now, to be honest, but yeah, I personally just don't play in Imba mode anymore.

Don't get me wrong; it's definitely fun. But I wouldn't do it on repeat since it takes the soul out of the game.

Rosalia and Ixchel came out too. Personally, I love Ixchel, and I'm saving up to buy Rosalia next. Just flat-out hard-earned cash, HAHAHAHA Ixchel was said to be a character akin to Invoker from Dota—a character that does seven different things all at once. In my experience, yeah, I can sort of see it. I understand that Ixchel is limited to its gameplay style, but it could've been better.

Final thoughts on the update: It's honestly great, but I wouldn't go into Imba mode, though. The update really gave life to characters that were forgotten in the meta, and I love seeing them get the love they've always deserved.

Looking at Hannah, she deserves that title as a one-shot hero

I’m hoping to hear if others have had similar experiences.

We met a couple of months ago through a shared hobby, and things clicked quickly. Conversation has always been fun and easy, and there’s definitely been mutual attraction. We’ve spent some time together having met up around 5 times now outside of the normal setting we see eachother in. These meets have been for casual coffees, walks, a cinema outing etc. 

It’s been really enjoyable and I have fallen hard, but we haven’t defined any formal relationship yet and ither than lingering hugs at the start and end of our meeting ups there has been little to no physical escalation. After the 3rd time I saw her i messaged asking for some clarification essentially saying i hope that these have been dates as I'd love to be more than freinds. She told me that she likes me and would like to be more than friends as well, but she also wants to take things slow and see how things progress naturally with no pressure. 

There are quite a few complicating factors in her life right now. She’s dealing with a university course, caring for a parent who is recovering from surgery, and her own recent injury and health issues. Her dad passed away some time ago, that has understandably left her feeling pretty rubbish. Add to this that she has elluded howver never explicitly spoken about the fact she came out of a relationship some time last year that I think may have some extra layers of complexity that I don't want to pry open, making her feel uncomfortable. 

Understandably, all of this leaves her very tired and stressed, which affects how she engages, particularly over text. She has, especially over the last 3 ish days been increasingly dry and slow to reply with little emotional warmth. Despite this however she has agreed to meet up in the next 3 days again however has expressed little emotion about this whereas previously she has made comments about looking forward to it and that she can't wait to see me. 


For me, this whole situation has been quite anxiety inducing. I genuinely really like her and want to be close, but my anxiety spikes when I don’t get mirrored warmth or affection, especially over text. I feel torn between wanting to respect her pace and wanting reassurance that she still cares and wanting to know where she sees this going (if anywhere). 

The uncertainty is exhausting me, and I don’t know whether her recent distance is just because of stress and tiredness or something deeper.

I’m struggling to figure out how to balance caring for her, respecting her pace, and protecting my own emotional wellbeing. I want to continue building on what we've got so far without over investing and burning myself out. 

Has anyone else been in a situation where someone has wanted to take things slow, had a lot of life stress, and your nervous system went into overdrive because of dry texting and apparent lack of direction? Did things ever settle, or did you end up deciding to step back? 

Any perspective, advice, or shared experiences would be hugely appreciated as I'm slowly losing my mind 😂. 


TLDR:

I’m in a 2-month talking stage with someone I like who wants to take things slow. She’s stressed with uni, family, and health issues, and her recent texts have been dry. I’m anxious and unsure how to balance respecting her pace with protecting my own emotional wellbeing. Anyone been through something similar?",2,1771275328.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I was invited by the Mods of this subreddit to share my weekly e-commerce news recaps (ie: shorter versions of my full editions) to [r/Shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shopify/). Although my news recaps aren't strictly about Shopify (some weeks Shopify is covered more than others), I hope they bring value to your business no matter what platform you're on.

Let's dive into this week's top stories...


___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Anthropic saw its daily active users grow by 11% after its Super Bowl ad, which threw shade at OpenAI's choice to put advertisements in ChatGPT. Following game day, the Claude app entered into the top 10 free apps on the Apple App store, surpassing OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta AI for the first time.
___
**Google** rolled out agentic commerce features that allow US shoppers to purchase items from Etsy and Wayfair directly within AI Mode in Search and the Gemini app, with Shopify, Walmart, and Target coming soon. Basically it's Google's answer to OpenAI's Instant Checkout, which launched in October. To power the transactions, Google is utilizing its Universal Commerce Protocol, an open-source standard for agentic commerce it developed in partnership with Shopify and major retailers that launched last month. The Buy button only triggers if you are signed into your Google account and that it already has your Google-linked payment method queued up in the experience.
___
**TikTok** introduced “Local Feeds” in the US, a feature that helps users discover nearby content, businesses, and services using their precise location. The featured first launched in the UK, Italy, and Germany this past December under the name “Nearby Feed.” The feed appears in a new dedicated Local Tab, which displays posts based on a user's location and interests, and when the content was posted. TikTok didn't say specifically that it prioritizes newer content, but I can imagine that the freshness of a post will play a role in whether it surfaces in the Local tab, as no one wants to discover an event that's already taken place or a coffee shop that's already gone out of business. Honestly I think TikTok Local is going to be a gamechanger for small businesses, which have lacked an impactful organic way to reach people in their own communities for over a decade.
___
**OpenAI** still isn't sure how it should handle the collection of sales taxes for purchases made through its site, according to two insiders who spoke to The Information. They should probably figure that out soon, right? OpenAI says in its terms of service that merchants are the ones facilitating the transactions and thus are responsible for the sales they make through ChatGPT, however, many state marketplace tax laws supersede that rule and become especially relevant given that OpenAI is processing the payments and taking a cut of the sale. That's a “marketplace” by any definition of the word.
___
**The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority** finalized new regulations for **BNPL** lenders to enforce stricter transparency, affordability, and support for customers who fall behind on payments. Under the new Consumer Duty rules, lenders must provide clear, upfront details about the agreement including when payments are due, amounts, and what happens if a borrower misses a payment. They are also required to ensure that customers can afford to repay what they borrow before offering BNPL, and they must provide support for customers facing financial difficulty. All lenders providing BNPL will need to be authorized by the FCA to operate.
___
**Amazon** is planning to launch a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI firms, according to publishing industry executives who spoke with the company about the project. Publishers have increasingly raised concerns that the growing use of AI chats and search summaries is resulting in fewer people actually visiting their sites, affecting their readership and ad revenue. Amazon thinks it can help solve that issue. **Microsoft** also recently launched a project called Publisher Content Marketplace that aims to address these problems for publishers as well. Microsoft says PMC ""is a direct value exchange: publishers will be paid on delivered value, and AI builders gain scalable access to licensed premium content that improves their products.""

Remember **Ring's Super Bowl ad** showcasing its doorbells and cameras' abilities to use AI to help find lost pets? The ad portrayed a family's search for their lost dog, with Ring coming to the rescue by showing additional smart doorbells around the neighborhood scanning for the pet and using AI to identify it. Heartwarming, right? Well, it turns out that most customers didn't know that their Ring devices could be used for that type of surveillance, and when they found out from the commercial, they didn't like it! The ability to find lost pets was a positive spin on the new abilities that Ring devices would receive following a planned integration with Flock Safety, which also would have reportedly provided law enforcement the ability to read license plates and request video footage from users for investigations. After receiving a ton of backlash from customers over the features, Ring has decided to cancel its partnership with Flock.
___
**Scott Galloway**, the Internet-famous marketing professor and host of Pivot and Prof G podcasts, has launched a month-long economic strike campaign called **Resist and Unsubscribe** that encourages people to cancel the tech subscriptions they use for work and entertainment. Galloway believes that the primary way to get President Trump's attention about issues our country is facing is by influencing the market. He notes that a single canceled ChatGPT Plus subscription at $240/year translates at a 40x revenue multiple to roughly $10,000 of lost market cap for OpenAI. The campaign primarily targets big tech companies including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, OpenAI, AT&T, Comcast, and more, with links made available to their various services on the website for easy cancellation. The campaign has been publicly endorsed by Don Lemon, Jon Steward, Chelsea Handler, and other high-profile journalists and celebrities, and has been growing in momentum during the first half of the month.

**FedEx** is pulling back from chasing general e-commerce volume to focus on more profitable “specialized” B2C and B2B segments such as healthcare, automotive, aerospace, data centers, and the premium end of e-commerce. The company said it expects only low single-digit growth in B2C volume through 2029, but that it's intentionally growing slower than the overall e-commerce market as it avoids competing heavily in low-margin, lightweight package shipments that are easily handled by USPS, Amazon, and other competitors. To be clear, FedEx isn't abandoning consumer deliveries entirely, it simply plans to target heavier, higher-value, and longer-distance shipments that it has a network in place to handle well.
___
**Amazon Pharmacy** is expanding same-day and next-day prescription delivery to nearly 4,500 U.S. cities and towns by the end of 2026, adding Idaho and Massachusetts to its list of states covered. Amazon says it will use a mix of delivery methods throughout the expansion including e-bikes in urban areas, electric vehicles in suburbs, ferries, and even horses in some remote areas to deliver medication. It also plans to continue growing its in-person kiosk network to additional locations throughout the year.
___
**Wizard**, an AI-native shopping agent cofounded by Marc Lore, who founded Jet and sold it Walmart, and CEO Melissa Bridgeford, launched publicly 4 years after its $50M Series A round. Initially the company focused on B2B conversational commerce, helping brands convert shoppers via text interactions, but later pivoted toward a consumer agent and entered a private beta to test engagement and conversion. The platform differentiates itself in the AI product discovery space by returning just five results, rather than thousands, and plans to monetize through transaction fees and affiliate revenue instead of selling sponsored product placements. A lot has changed since they raised that $50M!
___
**Shopify** updated its Sidekick AI assistant to allow merchants to generate customer and company profiles using plain language prompts. Shopify gave the example, “Create a customer named John Smith with email john@example-com and tag VIP.” The feature aims to streamline administrative tasks by processing any field on the creation forms through conversational input. Is writing a full sentence actually faster than typing a name and e-mail directly into a form field? In isolation, maybe not, but I imagine that the update is more about integrating customer creation into the Sidekick workflow so that you can then do things like create draft orders or trigger automated workflows for that customer through conversational prompts. 
___
**Ernst & Young** issued a cautionary note regarding the accounting treatment of Meta's $27B Hyperion data center project, identifying the joint venture with Blue Owl Capital as a “critical audit matter” due to the steps Meta took to keep the project off its balance sheet. Through the venture, Blue Owl Capital owns 80% and Meta only owns 20%, which means Meta technically doesn't control the venture under accounting rules, and therefore it doesn't have to put the project and its related debt on its balance sheet. This makes Meta look less leveraged, while not giving investors the full picture in regards to Meta's financial exposure tied to the project, which has ignited regulators to look into the project.
___
**Amazon** employees aren't allowed to use **Anthropic's Claude Code** for production code or for live products without formal approval, despite Amazon being one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing its AI models and products to customers. Amazon instead encourages its developers to use the company's in-house tool, Kiro, for production code, which runs on Claude models, but with AWS-built tooling. The internal policy has drawn criticism from engineers, including those responsible for selling AWS Bedrock, which offers customers access to Claude Code. In internal forums, roughly 1,500 employees endorsed formally adopting Claude Code, with some questioning how they can credibly promote a tool they are not permitted to use for official work.

**Meta** was granted a patent for an AI system capable of simulating a user's social media activity after their death or during long absences from the platform, however the company says it doesn't plan on using it. So why patent hoard then? In the patent, Meta says that during a user's long absence from social media or death, their “followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.” So to fill that void, Meta could create a digital clone of their social media presence to understand how they would (or did) behave, which could then like, comment, and send messages. That's not exactly the type of immortality most people are looking for, and also doesn't seem like a healthy way for living users to grieve. 
___
**Google** is expanding its “results about you” feature, which allows users to track the appearance of their personal information online, to include monitoring of their passport, driver's license, and Social Security numbers. Previously the monitoring was limited to a person's name, home address, e-mail address, and phone number. If this type of personal information shows up online, a person can request that Google remove the links from its search results. While Google can't takedown the site itself, it can remove the ability for other users to find it through their search and AI tools. The update is launching initially in the US before expanding to additional regions. Of course, the only catch is that in order for Google to monitor this personal information, you'll need to give it to them first, which some people might not want to do.
___
**Square** unveiled a new AI-powered data assistant built directly into its dashboard that allows business owners to ask questions about their sales, customer, and labor data, analyze sales and customer trends, and receive guidance on Square products using natural language. Square says the assistant is designed to surface actionable insights faster by translating business data into conversational responses rather than requiring manual report building, expanding its earlier AI features into deeper analytics and product recommendations. (Although be sure to fact check those numbers! Scroll down to read this week's “Most Ridiculous Story” to learn why.) The tool is included at no additional cost within the Square Dashboard and POS app. 
___
**Poshmark** is simplifying its shipping upgrades for heavier packages, cutting the number of seller-paid tiers from five to two and raising the maximum weight from 10 lbs to 15 lbs. Under the new system, sellers pay a flat $5 upgrade for 5.1–10 lb packages and $10 for 10.1–15 lb packages, while the buyer base rate of $6.49 for up to 5 lbs remains unchanged. The change lowers costs for many heavier shipments but slightly increases costs for sellers shipping 5.1–6 lb packages, which now cost $0.50 more per order than before.
___
**OpenAI** warned US lawmakers that DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, is targeting its platform and other domestic AI companies to replicate their models and use them for its own training. The company claims that DeepSeek employees have developed methods to circumvent its restrictions and access models by obfuscating their source and that its models are “actively cutting corners when it comes to safely training and deploying new models.” Well isn't that the pot calling the kettle black! Google also brought similar issues to light in a recent report, though it didn't name any particular companies when referencing the attacks.
___
**OpenAI** officially retired its controversial GPT-4o model on Feb 13th, alongside other models including 4.1, 4.1 mini, o4-mini, and the original GPT-5 Instant and Thinking variants. The company originally sunset the GPT-4o model last August when it released GPT-5, however it brought the model back a week later after intense user backlash. I predicted last year that it would only be a matter of time before they sunset the model again. Was it for the better? Users were forming intensely close relationships with 4o, which couldn't have been healthy. However, the problem is that they had *already formed* the relationships, and OpenAI snatched them away, which also doesn't feel healthy. Either way, I guess it's time to mourn and move on.
___
**Albertsons** joined an **OpenAI** pilot to test sponsored placements inside ChatGPT, starting with Valentine’s Day-related prompts like “best flowers for Valentine’s Day” that surfaced ads from local Albertsons stores. The ads appeared only for logged-in Free and Go tier users, were clearly labeled as sponsored, and OpenAI says that they did not influence ChatGPT’s organic responses. If shoppers chose to engage with the ad, they were directed to a Valentine’s Day destination featuring Albertsons deals, gifts and recipes including fresh flowers, chocolates, and gifts that could be delivered in as little as 30 minutes. Perfect for every guy that forgot it was Valentine's Day!
___
**In corporate shakeups this week…**

* An **Anthropic** researcher named Mrinank Sharma, who led the company's Safeguards Research Team since it was formed early last year and has been at Anthropic since 2023, announced his resignation through a letter that said, “The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.”
* **OpenAI** recruited **OpenClaw** founder Peter Steinberger and a handful of other team members to join the company and work on personal agents within its labs. Meta was also wooing Steinberger, but ultimately he went with OpenAI.
* **OpenAI** disbanded its Mission Alignment team, a group formed in 2024 to promote the company's goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits humanity, and reassigned the team's six members to other departments.
* **Elon Musk** overhauled xAI's leadership structure following its merger with SpaceX, coinciding with an exodus of half of its 12 founding staffers.
* **Target CEO Michael Fiddelke** appointed its now-former chief guest experience offer, Cara Sylvester, as its chief merchandising officer, and its former chief merchandising officer of food, essentials, and beauty, Lisa Roath, as its chief operating officer, moving towards a single chief merchandising officer structure. It's now on the hunt for a new chief guest experience and marketing officer.
* **eBay** appointed Michelle Warvel as its new VP of AI Transformation to lead the company's AI endeavors. Warvel joined eBay in 2022 and most recently served as its VP of Product Transformation & PMO.
* **WPP** is rumored to be moving its creative agencies under an umbrella called WPP Creative, in a move that Adweek calls “too little, too late” in reviving its business.
* **Anthropic** appointed Chris Liddell, a former Microsoft and GM executive who helped take the automaker public, to its board.
___
**In layoffs this week…**

* **Google** offered voluntary exit packages to employees in its business unit who are unprepared for the company's AI-driven transformation, letting employees who choose to remain know that they need to be “embracing AI to have even greater impact.”
* **OpenAI** fired one of its top safety executives, Ryan Beiermeister, citing sexual discrimination, after she voiced opposition towards the planned AI erotica feature in ChatGPT. Beiermeister said that the allegations are “absolutely false,” while OpenAI insists that her departure was not related to any issues she raised while at the company.
___
**In lawsuits this week…**

* **Estée Lauder** filed a federal lawsuit against **Walmart**, alleging that counterfeit versions of its luxury brands were sold through Walmart’s third-party marketplace. The complaint alleges trademark infringement and unfair competition, claiming Walmart failed to adequately vet marketplace sellers, and seeks to hold the retailer liable for facilitating the sales.
* **Autodesk** is suing **Google** for allegedly infringing on its “Flow” trademark to market competing AI video production tools used to make movies, TV shows and video games. Autodesk began using Flow in Sep 2022 for visual effects, production management, and other products, and Google launched Flow software in May 2025 aimed at the same market. Autodesk is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the consumer confusion and alleged irreparable harm caused by Google.
* **The International Brotherhood of Teamsters** filed a lawsuit against **UPS** to seek a temporary restraining order against the company's next planned round of driver buyouts. The buyouts come as UPS continues its plan to downsize its network in the wake of lower volume from Amazon.
* **UPS** is suing **Temu** for €37M for unpaid delivery bills, alleging that the retailer continued placing orders without making meaningful payments between September 2024 and September 2025. Why did UPS let it go on for that long?
* In other bad news for **Temu**, the estate of **MF Doom** received judicial approval to proceed with its trademark infringement lawsuit against the company regarding the sale of counterfeit merchandise. A federal judge ruled that the amended complaint plausibly alleges the e-commerce platform is exercising direct control over the distribution and pricing of infringing goods.
* **Scale AI** filed a lawsuit against the **Department of Defense**, but it's unclear why as most of the case documents are classified. However *Business Insider* notes that Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708M from the DoD to Enabled Intelligence last all and later filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office, which was dismissed in January, so it's likely related to that.
___
**Google** gained unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $32B acquisition of **Wiz**, its biggest acquisition to date, after regulators said the deal would not raise any competition concerns. EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said, “Google stands behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of market shares in cloud infrastructure, and our assessment confirmed that customers will continue to have credible alternatives and the ability to switch providers.”
___
**Pinterest CEO Bill Ready** blamed Trump tariffs as the reason why ad revenue dropped at the company during the past year. He said, “Many of the largest retailers have been disproportionately impacted by tariffs and have been pulling back on advertising spend across the industry as they seek to protect their margins.” Ready said that he's not satisfied with Pinterest's Q4 performance, during which it fell short of Wall Street's expectations, and laid out plans to “further broaden our revenue mix and accelerate the next phase of our sales and go to market transformation.”
___
**Amazon**, **Microsoft**, and **Google** are looking to skirt President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee by finding workers in categories that don't have to pay the fee including existing H-1B visa holders, students, and workers in the US on other types of visas. The firms are also leaning on programs like Optional Practical Training, which gives foreign graduates at US universities temporary employment after graduation, and prioritizing higher-paid applicants to improve lottery odds, which are strategies that smaller startups say they can’t easily replicate, leaving them at a disadvantage under the new rules.
___
**Apple** and **Google** agreed to modify their UK app store practices to improve fairness and transparency for developers following an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. The changes include fairer ranking and review processes, safeguards around developer data, and expanded iOS feature access for competing products such as digital wallets and live translation. The commitments do not address the companies' commission fees on app sales, which can range as high as 30%, but the CMA said steering users to alternative payment methods remains under discussion. The regulator also noted that it's choosing to negotiate commitments rather than impose formal requirements under its new digital markets regime because it delivers quicker results.
___
**Canadian institutional investors** are reconsidering their heavy allocation to U.S. assets due to rising political instability and market volatility. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, one of Canada's largest pension funds, cut its U.S. dollar exposure by 56% last year while national foreign direct investment into the U.S. dropped by 69%. Fund managers are increasingly diversifying into alternative currencies like the Swiss franc and Japanese yen to hedge against USD fluctuation.
___
**Flipkart** is evaluating a launch into the online food delivery market to challenge leaders like Zomato and Swiggy in India. The company is planning to pilot a program in Bengaluru for mid-2026, with a full-scale launch likely by the end of this year, and weighing whether to launch the service as a standalone platform or roll out a buyer-side application on the ONDC, according to *ET* sources. Flipkart narrowed its losses during its last fiscal year and is planning for an IPO later this year.
___
**JD-com** launched **JoyExpress**, a proprietary logistics service, in the UK and Europe in anticipation of launching the Joybuy e-commerce platform next month. The company is deploying a fleet of uniformed drivers and electric vehicles to facilitate same-day delivery in major cities throughout the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, aiming to challenge competitors by managing its own inventory in local warehouses rather than relying solely on third-party sellers. Unlike other Chinese e-commerce giants like Temu and Alibaba, Joybuy operates as a retailer, holding stock in its own warehouses, rather than operate as a marketplace where goods are shipped directly from sellers.
___
**The European Commission** is investigating **Google** for “artificially increasing the clearing price” of ad auctions “to the detriment of advertisers,” according to a letter seen by *Bloomberg*. The suspected conduct could violate the region's competition rules, which could trigger fines as high as 10% of global annual sales. The commission has already fined Google €9.5B for violating the Digital Markets Act, and being found guilty of anticompetitive behavior in online advertising could add to that total. However the Commission has yet to announce a formal investigation.
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** A Redditor shared a story on r/analytics about how his company's AI has been making up analytics data for 3 months when answering leadership questions about metrics. He wrote, “It seemed amazing at first fast answers, detailed explanations, everyone loved it. I just found out it's been hallucinating numbers this entire time. Our VP of sales made territory decisions based on data that didn't exist. Our CFO showed the board a deck with fake insights. The AI was just inventing plausible sounding percentages. I only caught it by accident when someone asked me to double check something. I started digging, and holy shit, it's bad.” The original post has since been removed by moderators, but you can still read through the comments where users share similar stories. I have a few of my own. I've caught ChatGPT messing up basic addition before! I would never trust AI to process data or insights that I submitted to investors, but apparently people are doing it.
___
Plus 17 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Salesforce** acquiring **Cimulate**.

I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

1r6lld9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopifyeCommerce/comments/1r6lld9/whats_new_in_ecommerce_week_of_feb_16th_2026/,"What's new in e-commerce? 🔥 Week of Feb 16th, 2026","Hi [r/ShopifyeCommerce](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopifyeCommerce/) \- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my [Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter](https://www.shopifreaks.com/). Every week for the past 5 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...


___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Anthropic saw its daily active users grow by 11% after its Super Bowl ad, which threw shade at OpenAI's choice to put advertisements in ChatGPT. Following game day, the Claude app entered into the top 10 free apps on the Apple App store, surpassing OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta AI for the first time.
___
**Google** rolled out agentic commerce features that allow US shoppers to purchase items from Etsy and Wayfair directly within AI Mode in Search and the Gemini app, with Shopify, Walmart, and Target coming soon. Basically it's Google's answer to OpenAI's Instant Checkout, which launched in October. To power the transactions, Google is utilizing its Universal Commerce Protocol, an open-source standard for agentic commerce it developed in partnership with Shopify and major retailers that launched last month. The Buy button only triggers if you are signed into your Google account and that it already has your Google-linked payment method queued up in the experience.
___
**TikTok** introduced “Local Feeds” in the US, a feature that helps users discover nearby content, businesses, and services using their precise location. The featured first launched in the UK, Italy, and Germany this past December under the name “Nearby Feed.” The feed appears in a new dedicated Local Tab, which displays posts based on a user's location and interests, and when the content was posted. TikTok didn't say specifically that it prioritizes newer content, but I can imagine that the freshness of a post will play a role in whether it surfaces in the Local tab, as no one wants to discover an event that's already taken place or a coffee shop that's already gone out of business. Honestly I think TikTok Local is going to be a gamechanger for small businesses, which have lacked an impactful organic way to reach people in their own communities for over a decade.
___
**OpenAI** still isn't sure how it should handle the collection of sales taxes for purchases made through its site, according to two insiders who spoke to The Information. They should probably figure that out soon, right? OpenAI says in its terms of service that merchants are the ones facilitating the transactions and thus are responsible for the sales they make through ChatGPT, however, many state marketplace tax laws supersede that rule and become especially relevant given that OpenAI is processing the payments and taking a cut of the sale. That's a “marketplace” by any definition of the word.
___
**The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority** finalized new regulations for **BNPL** lenders to enforce stricter transparency, affordability, and support for customers who fall behind on payments. Under the new Consumer Duty rules, lenders must provide clear, upfront details about the agreement including when payments are due, amounts, and what happens if a borrower misses a payment. They are also required to ensure that customers can afford to repay what they borrow before offering BNPL, and they must provide support for customers facing financial difficulty. All lenders providing BNPL will need to be authorized by the FCA to operate.
___
**Amazon** is planning to launch a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI firms, according to publishing industry executives who spoke with the company about the project. Publishers have increasingly raised concerns that the growing use of AI chats and search summaries is resulting in fewer people actually visiting their sites, affecting their readership and ad revenue. Amazon thinks it can help solve that issue. **Microsoft** also recently launched a project called Publisher Content Marketplace that aims to address these problems for publishers as well. Microsoft says PMC ""is a direct value exchange: publishers will be paid on delivered value, and AI builders gain scalable access to licensed premium content that improves their products.""
___
Remember **Ring's Super Bowl ad** showcasing its doorbells and cameras' abilities to use AI to help find lost pets? The ad portrayed a family's search for their lost dog, with Ring coming to the rescue by showing additional smart doorbells around the neighborhood scanning for the pet and using AI to identify it. Heartwarming, right? Well, it turns out that most customers didn't know that their Ring devices could be used for that type of surveillance, and when they found out from the commercial, they didn't like it! The ability to find lost pets was a positive spin on the new abilities that Ring devices would receive following a planned integration with Flock Safety, which also would have reportedly provided law enforcement the ability to read license plates and request video footage from users for investigations. After receiving a ton of backlash from customers over the features, Ring has decided to cancel its partnership with Flock.
___
**Scott Galloway**, the Internet-famous marketing professor and host of Pivot and Prof G podcasts, has launched a month-long economic strike campaign called **Resist and Unsubscribe** that encourages people to cancel the tech subscriptions they use for work and entertainment. Galloway believes that the primary way to get President Trump's attention about issues our country is facing is by influencing the market. He notes that a single canceled ChatGPT Plus subscription at $240/year translates at a 40x revenue multiple to roughly $10,000 of lost market cap for OpenAI. The campaign primarily targets big tech companies including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, OpenAI, AT&T, Comcast, and more, with links made available to their various services on the website for easy cancellation. The campaign has been publicly endorsed by Don Lemon, Jon Steward, Chelsea Handler, and other high-profile journalists and celebrities, and has been growing in momentum during the first half of the month.
___
**FedEx** is pulling back from chasing general e-commerce volume to focus on more profitable “specialized” B2C and B2B segments such as healthcare, automotive, aerospace, data centers, and the premium end of e-commerce. The company said it expects only low single-digit growth in B2C volume through 2029, but that it's intentionally growing slower than the overall e-commerce market as it avoids competing heavily in low-margin, lightweight package shipments that are easily handled by USPS, Amazon, and other competitors. To be clear, FedEx isn't abandoning consumer deliveries entirely, it simply plans to target heavier, higher-value, and longer-distance shipments that it has a network in place to handle well.
___
**Amazon Pharmacy** is expanding same-day and next-day prescription delivery to nearly 4,500 U.S. cities and towns by the end of 2026, adding Idaho and Massachusetts to its list of states covered. Amazon says it will use a mix of delivery methods throughout the expansion including e-bikes in urban areas, electric vehicles in suburbs, ferries, and even horses in some remote areas to deliver medication. It also plans to continue growing its in-person kiosk network to additional locations throughout the year.
___
**Wizard**, an AI-native shopping agent cofounded by Marc Lore, who founded Jet and sold it Walmart, and CEO Melissa Bridgeford, launched publicly 4 years after its $50M Series A round. Initially the company focused on B2B conversational commerce, helping brands convert shoppers via text interactions, but later pivoted toward a consumer agent and entered a private beta to test engagement and conversion. The platform differentiates itself in the AI product discovery space by returning just five results, rather than thousands, and plans to monetize through transaction fees and affiliate revenue instead of selling sponsored product placements. A lot has changed since they raised that $50M!
___
**Shopify** updated its Sidekick AI assistant to allow merchants to generate customer and company profiles using plain language prompts. Shopify gave the example, “Create a customer named John Smith with email john@example-com and tag VIP.” The feature aims to streamline administrative tasks by processing any field on the creation forms through conversational input. Is writing a full sentence actually faster than typing a name and e-mail directly into a form field? In isolation, maybe not, but I imagine that the update is more about integrating customer creation into the Sidekick workflow so that you can then do things like create draft orders or trigger automated workflows for that customer through conversational prompts. 
___
**Ernst & Young** issued a cautionary note regarding the accounting treatment of Meta's $27B Hyperion data center project, identifying the joint venture with Blue Owl Capital as a “critical audit matter” due to the steps Meta took to keep the project off its balance sheet. Through the venture, Blue Owl Capital owns 80% and Meta only owns 20%, which means Meta technically doesn't control the venture under accounting rules, and therefore it doesn't have to put the project and its related debt on its balance sheet. This makes Meta look less leveraged, while not giving investors the full picture in regards to Meta's financial exposure tied to the project, which has ignited regulators to look into the project.
___
**Amazon** employees aren't allowed to use **Anthropic's Claude Code** for production code or for live products without formal approval, despite Amazon being one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing its AI models and products to customers. Amazon instead encourages its developers to use the company's in-house tool, Kiro, for production code, which runs on Claude models, but with AWS-built tooling. The internal policy has drawn criticism from engineers, including those responsible for selling AWS Bedrock, which offers customers access to Claude Code. In internal forums, roughly 1,500 employees endorsed formally adopting Claude Code, with some questioning how they can credibly promote a tool they are not permitted to use for official work.
___
**Meta** was granted a patent for an AI system capable of simulating a user's social media activity after their death or during long absences from the platform, however the company says it doesn't plan on using it. So why patent hoard then? In the patent, Meta says that during a user's long absence from social media or death, their “followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.” So to fill that void, Meta could create a digital clone of their social media presence to understand how they would (or did) behave, which could then like, comment, and send messages. That's not exactly the type of immortality most people are looking for, and also doesn't seem like a healthy way for living users to grieve. 
___
**Google** is expanding its “results about you” feature, which allows users to track the appearance of their personal information online, to include monitoring of their passport, driver's license, and Social Security numbers. Previously the monitoring was limited to a person's name, home address, e-mail address, and phone number. If this type of personal information shows up online, a person can request that Google remove the links from its search results. While Google can't takedown the site itself, it can remove the ability for other users to find it through their search and AI tools. The update is launching initially in the US before expanding to additional regions. Of course, the only catch is that in order for Google to monitor this personal information, you'll need to give it to them first, which some people might not want to do.
___
**Square** unveiled a new AI-powered data assistant built directly into its dashboard that allows business owners to ask questions about their sales, customer, and labor data, analyze sales and customer trends, and receive guidance on Square products using natural language. Square says the assistant is designed to surface actionable insights faster by translating business data into conversational responses rather than requiring manual report building, expanding its earlier AI features into deeper analytics and product recommendations. (Although be sure to fact check those numbers! Scroll down to read this week's “Most Ridiculous Story” to learn why.)

The ads appeared only for logged-in Free and Go tier users, were clearly labeled as sponsored, and OpenAI says that they did not influence ChatGPT’s organic responses. If shoppers chose to engage with the ad, they were directed to a Valentine’s Day destination featuring Albertsons deals, gifts and recipes including fresh flowers, chocolates, and gifts that could be delivered in as little as 30 minutes. Perfect for every guy that forgot it was Valentine's Day!

**Amazon**, **Microsoft**, and **Google** are looking to skirt President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee by finding workers in categories that don't have to pay the fee including existing H-1B visa holders, students, and workers in the US on other types of visas. The firms are also leaning on programs like Optional Practical Training, which gives foreign graduates at US universities temporary employment after graduation, and prioritizing higher-paid applicants to improve lottery odds, which are strategies that smaller startups say they can’t easily replicate, leaving them at a disadvantage under the new rules.
___
**Apple** and **Google** agreed to modify their UK app store practices to improve fairness and transparency for developers following an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. The changes include fairer ranking and review processes, safeguards around developer data, and expanded iOS feature access for competing products such as digital wallets and live translation. The commitments do not address the companies' commission fees on app sales, which can range as high as 30%, but the CMA said steering users to alternative payment methods remains under discussion. The regulator also noted that it's choosing to negotiate commitments rather than impose formal requirements under its new digital markets regime because it delivers quicker results.
___
**Canadian institutional investors** are reconsidering their heavy allocation to U.S. assets due to rising political instability and market volatility. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, one of Canada's largest pension funds, cut its U.S. dollar exposure by 56% last year while national foreign direct investment into the U.S. dropped by 69%. Fund managers are increasingly diversifying into alternative currencies like the Swiss franc and Japanese yen to hedge against USD fluctuation.
___
**Flipkart** is evaluating a launch into the online food delivery market to challenge leaders like Zomato and Swiggy in India. The company is planning to pilot a program in Bengaluru for mid-2026, with a full-scale launch likely by the end of this year, and weighing whether to launch the service as a standalone platform or roll out a buyer-side application on the ONDC, according to *ET* sources. Flipkart narrowed its losses during its last fiscal year and is planning for an IPO later this year.
___
**JD-com** launched **JoyExpress**, a proprietary logistics service, in the UK and Europe in anticipation of launching the Joybuy e-commerce platform next month. The company is deploying a fleet of uniformed drivers and electric vehicles to facilitate same-day delivery in major cities throughout the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, aiming to challenge competitors by managing its own inventory in local warehouses rather than relying solely on third-party sellers. Unlike other Chinese e-commerce giants like Temu and Alibaba, Joybuy operates as a retailer, holding stock in its own warehouses, rather than operate as a marketplace where goods are shipped directly from sellers.
___
**The European Commission** is investigating **Google** for “artificially increasing the clearing price” of ad auctions “to the detriment of advertisers,” according to a letter seen by *Bloomberg*. The suspected conduct could violate the region's competition rules, which could trigger fines as high as 10% of global annual sales. The commission has already fined Google €9.5B for violating the Digital Markets Act, and being found guilty of anticompetitive behavior in online advertising could add to that total. However the Commission has yet to announce a formal investigation.
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** A Redditor shared a story on r/analytics about how his company's AI has been making up analytics data for 3 months when answering leadership questions about metrics. He wrote, “It seemed amazing at first fast answers, detailed explanations, everyone loved it. I just found out it's been hallucinating numbers this entire time. Our VP of sales made territory decisions based on data that didn't exist. Our CFO showed the board a deck with fake insights. The AI was just inventing plausible sounding percentages. I only caught it by accident when someone asked me to double check something. I started digging, and holy shit, it's bad.” The original post has since been removed by moderators, but you can still read through the comments where users share similar stories. I have a few of my own. I've caught ChatGPT messing up basic addition before! I would never trust AI to process data or insights that I submitted to investors, but apparently people are doing it.
___
Plus 17 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Salesforce** acquiring **Cimulate**.

1r6lksk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1r6lksk/ecommerce_industry_news_recap_week_of_feb_16th/,"E-commerce Industry News Recap 🔥 Week of Feb 16th, 2026","Hi r/ecommerce \- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 5 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Anthropic saw its daily active users grow by 11% after its Super Bowl ad, which threw shade at OpenAI's choice to put advertisements in ChatGPT. Following game day, the Claude app entered into the top 10 free apps on the Apple App store, surpassing OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta AI for the first time.
___
**Google** rolled out agentic commerce features that allow US shoppers to purchase items from Etsy and Wayfair directly within AI Mode in Search and the Gemini app, with Shopify, Walmart, and Target coming soon. Basically it's Google's answer to OpenAI's Instant Checkout, which launched in October. To power the transactions, Google is utilizing its Universal Commerce Protocol, an open-source standard for agentic commerce it developed in partnership with Shopify and major retailers that launched last month. The Buy button only triggers if you are signed into your Google account and that it already has your Google-linked payment method queued up in the experience.
___
**TikTok** introduced “Local Feeds” in the US, a feature that helps users discover nearby content, businesses, and services using their precise location. The featured first launched in the UK, Italy, and Germany this past December under the name “Nearby Feed.” The feed appears in a new dedicated Local Tab, which displays posts based on a user's location and interests, and when the content was posted. TikTok didn't say specifically that it prioritizes newer content, but I can imagine that the freshness of a post will play a role in whether it surfaces in the Local tab, as no one wants to discover an event that's already taken place or a coffee shop that's already gone out of business. Honestly I think TikTok Local is going to be a gamechanger for small businesses, which have lacked an impactful organic way to reach people in their own communities for over a decade.
___
**OpenAI** still isn't sure how it should handle the collection of sales taxes for purchases made through its site, according to two insiders who spoke to The Information. They should probably figure that out soon, right? OpenAI says in its terms of service that merchants are the ones facilitating the transactions and thus are responsible for the sales they make through ChatGPT, however, many state marketplace tax laws supersede that rule and become especially relevant given that OpenAI is processing the payments and taking a cut of the sale. That's a “marketplace” by any definition of the word.
___
**The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority** finalized new regulations for **BNPL** lenders to enforce stricter transparency, affordability, and support for customers who fall behind on payments. Under the new Consumer Duty rules, lenders must provide clear, upfront details about the agreement including when payments are due, amounts, and what happens if a borrower misses a payment. They are also required to ensure that customers can afford to repay what they borrow before offering BNPL, and they must provide support for customers facing financial difficulty. All lenders providing BNPL will need to be authorized by the FCA to operate.
___
**Amazon** is planning to launch a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI firms, according to publishing industry executives who spoke with the company about the project. Publishers have increasingly raised concerns that the growing use of AI chats and search summaries is resulting in fewer people actually visiting their sites, affecting their readership and ad revenue. Amazon thinks it can help solve that issue. **Microsoft** also recently launched a project called Publisher Content Marketplace that aims to address these problems for publishers as well. Microsoft says PMC ""is a direct value exchange: publishers will be paid on delivered value, and AI builders gain scalable access to licensed premium content that improves their products.""
___
Remember **Ring's Super Bowl ad** showcasing its doorbells and cameras' abilities to use AI to help find lost pets? The ad portrayed a family's search for their lost dog, with Ring coming to the rescue by showing additional smart doorbells around the neighborhood scanning for the pet and using AI to identify it. Heartwarming, right? Well, it turns out that most customers didn't know that their Ring devices could be used for that type of surveillance, and when they found out from the commercial, they didn't like it! The ability to find lost pets was a positive spin on the new abilities that Ring devices would receive following a planned integration with Flock Safety, which also would have reportedly provided law enforcement the ability to read license plates and request video footage from users for investigations. After receiving a ton of backlash from customers over the features, Ring has decided to cancel its partnership with Flock.
___
**Scott Galloway**, the Internet-famous marketing professor and host of Pivot and Prof G podcasts, has launched a month-long economic strike campaign called **Resist and Unsubscribe** that encourages people to cancel the tech subscriptions they use for work and entertainment. Galloway believes that the primary way to get President Trump's attention about issues our country is facing is by influencing the market. He notes that a single canceled ChatGPT Plus subscription at $240/year translates at a 40x revenue multiple to roughly $10,000 of lost market cap for OpenAI. The campaign primarily targets big tech companies including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, OpenAI, AT&T, Comcast, and more, with links made available to their various services on the website for easy cancellation. The campaign has been publicly endorsed by Don Lemon, Jon Steward, Chelsea Handler, and other high-profile journalists and celebrities, and has been growing in momentum during the first half of the month.
___
**FedEx** is pulling back from chasing general e-commerce volume to focus on more profitable “specialized” B2C and B2B segments such as healthcare, automotive, aerospace, data centers, and the premium end of e-commerce. The company said it expects only low single-digit growth in B2C volume through 2029, but that it's intentionally growing slower than the overall e-commerce market as it avoids competing heavily in low-margin, lightweight package shipments that are easily handled by USPS, Amazon, and other competitors. To be clear, FedEx isn't abandoning consumer deliveries entirely, it simply plans to target heavier, higher-value, and longer-distance shipments that it has a network in place to handle well.
___
**Amazon Pharmacy** is expanding same-day and next-day prescription delivery to nearly 4,500 U.S. cities and towns by the end of 2026, adding Idaho and Massachusetts to its list of states covered. Amazon says it will use a mix of delivery methods throughout the expansion including e-bikes in urban areas, electric vehicles in suburbs, ferries, and even horses in some remote areas to deliver medication. It also plans to continue growing its in-person kiosk network to additional locations throughout the year.
___
**Wizard**, an AI-native shopping agent cofounded by Marc Lore, who founded Jet and sold it Walmart, and CEO Melissa Bridgeford, launched publicly 4 years after its $50M Series A round. Initially the company focused on B2B conversational commerce, helping brands convert shoppers via text interactions, but later pivoted toward a consumer agent and entered a private beta to test engagement and conversion. The platform differentiates itself in the AI product discovery space by returning just five results, rather than thousands, and plans to monetize through transaction fees and affiliate revenue instead of selling sponsored product placements. A lot has changed since they raised that $50M!
___
**Shopify** updated its Sidekick AI assistant to allow merchants to generate customer and company profiles using plain language prompts. Shopify gave the example, “Create a customer named John Smith with email john@example-com and tag VIP.” The feature aims to streamline administrative tasks by processing any field on the creation forms through conversational input. Is writing a full sentence actually faster than typing a name and e-mail directly into a form field? In isolation, maybe not, but I imagine that the update is more about integrating customer creation into the Sidekick workflow so that you can then do things like create draft orders or trigger automated workflows for that customer through conversational prompts. 
___
**Ernst & Young** issued a cautionary note regarding the accounting treatment of Meta's $27B Hyperion data center project, identifying the joint venture with Blue Owl Capital as a “critical audit matter” due to the steps Meta took to keep the project off its balance sheet. Through the venture, Blue Owl Capital owns 80% and Meta only owns 20%, which means Meta technically doesn't control the venture under accounting rules, and therefore it doesn't have to put the project and its related debt on its balance sheet. This makes Meta look less leveraged, while not giving investors the full picture in regards to Meta's financial exposure tied to the project, which has ignited regulators to look into the project.
___
**Amazon** employees aren't allowed to use **Anthropic's Claude Code** for production code or for live products without formal approval, despite Amazon being one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing its AI models and products to customers. Amazon instead encourages its developers to use the company's in-house tool, Kiro, for production code, which runs on Claude models, but with AWS-built tooling. The internal policy has drawn criticism from engineers, including those responsible for selling AWS Bedrock, which offers customers access to Claude Code. In internal forums, roughly 1,500 employees endorsed formally adopting Claude Code, with some questioning how they can credibly promote a tool they are not permitted to use for official work.
___
**Meta** was granted a patent for an AI system capable of simulating a user's social media activity after their death or during long absences from the platform, however the company says it doesn't plan on using it. So why patent hoard then? In the patent, Meta says that during a user's long absence from social media or death, their “followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.” So to fill that void, Meta could create a digital clone of their social media presence to understand how they would (or did) behave, which could then like, comment, and send messages. That's not exactly the type of immortality most people are looking for, and also doesn't seem like a healthy way for living users to grieve. 
___
**Google** is expanding its “results about you” feature, which allows users to track the appearance of their personal information online, to include monitoring of their passport, driver's license, and Social Security numbers. Previously the monitoring was limited to a person's name, home address, e-mail address, and phone number. If this type of personal information shows up online, a person can request that Google remove the links from its search results. While Google can't takedown the site itself, it can remove the ability for other users to find it through their search and AI tools. The update is launching initially in the US before expanding to additional regions. Of course, the only catch is that in order for Google to monitor this personal information, you'll need to give it to them first, which some people might not want to do.
___
**Square** unveiled a new AI-powered data assistant built directly into its dashboard that allows business owners to ask questions about their sales, customer, and labor data, analyze sales and customer trends, and receive guidance on Square products using natural language. Square says the assistant is designed to surface actionable insights faster by translating business data into conversational responses rather than requiring manual report building, expanding its earlier AI features into deeper analytics and product recommendations. (Although be sure to fact check those numbers! Scroll down to read this week's “Most Ridiculous Story” to learn why.) The tool is included at no additional cost within the Square Dashboard and POS app. 
___
**Poshmark** is simplifying its shipping upgrades for heavier packages, cutting the number of seller-paid tiers from five to two and raising the maximum weight from 10 lbs to 15 lbs. Under the new system, sellers pay a flat $5 upgrade for 5.1–10 lb packages and $10 for 10.1–15 lb packages, while the buyer base rate of $6.49 for up to 5 lbs remains unchanged. The change lowers costs for many heavier shipments but slightly increases costs for sellers shipping 5.1–6 lb packages, which now cost $0.50 more per order than before.
___
**OpenAI** warned US lawmakers that DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, is targeting its platform and other domestic AI companies to replicate their models and use them for its own training. The company claims that DeepSeek employees have developed methods to circumvent its restrictions and access models by obfuscating their source and that its models are “actively cutting corners when it comes to safely training and deploying new models.” Well isn't that the pot calling the kettle black! Google also brought similar issues to light in a recent report, though it didn't name any particular companies when referencing the attacks.
___
**OpenAI** officially retired its controversial GPT-4o model on Feb 13th, alongside other models including 4.1, 4.1 mini, o4-mini, and the original GPT-5 Instant and Thinking variants. The company originally sunset the GPT-4o model last August when it released GPT-5, however it brought the model back a week later after intense user backlash. I predicted last year that it would only be a matter of time before they sunset the model again. Was it for the better? Users were forming intensely close relationships with 4o, which couldn't have been healthy. However, the problem is that they had *already formed* the relationships, and OpenAI snatched them away, which also doesn't feel healthy. Either way, I guess it's time to mourn and move on.
___
**Albertsons** joined an **OpenAI** pilot to test sponsored placements inside ChatGPT, starting with Valentine’s Day-related prompts like “best flowers for Valentine’s Day” that surfaced ads from local Albertsons stores. The ads appeared only for logged-in Free and Go tier users, were clearly labeled as sponsored, and OpenAI says that they did not influence ChatGPT’s organic responses. If shoppers chose to engage with the ad, they were directed to a Valentine’s Day destination featuring Albertsons deals, gifts and recipes including fresh flowers, chocolates, and gifts that could be delivered in as little as 30 minutes. Perfect for every guy that forgot it was Valentine's Day!
___
**In corporate shakeups this week…**

* An **Anthropic** researcher named Mrinank Sharma, who led the company's Safeguards Research Team since it was formed early last year and has been at Anthropic since 2023, announced his resignation through a letter that said, “The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.”
* **OpenAI** recruited **OpenClaw** founder Peter Steinberger and a handful of other team members to join the company and work on personal agents within its labs. Meta was also wooing Steinberger, but ultimately he went with OpenAI.
* **OpenAI** disbanded its Mission Alignment team, a group formed in 2024 to promote the company's goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits humanity, and reassigned the team's six members to other departments.
* **Elon Musk** overhauled xAI's leadership structure following its merger with SpaceX, coinciding with an exodus of half of its 12 founding staffers.
* **Target CEO Michael Fiddelke** appointed its now-former chief guest experience offer, Cara Sylvester, as its chief merchandising officer, and its former chief merchandising officer of food, essentials, and beauty, Lisa Roath, as its chief operating officer, moving towards a single chief merchandising officer structure. It's now on the hunt for a new chief guest experience and marketing officer.
* **eBay** appointed Michelle Warvel as its new VP of AI Transformation to lead the company's AI endeavors. Warvel joined eBay in 2022 and most recently served as its VP of Product Transformation & PMO.
* **WPP** is rumored to be moving its creative agencies under an umbrella called WPP Creative, in a move that Adweek calls “too little, too late” in reviving its business.
* **Anthropic** appointed Chris Liddell, a former Microsoft and GM executive who helped take the automaker public, to its board.
___
**In layoffs this week…**

* **Google** offered voluntary exit packages to employees in its business unit who are unprepared for the company's AI-driven transformation, letting employees who choose to remain know that they need to be “embracing AI to have even greater impact.”
* **OpenAI** fired one of its top safety executives, Ryan Beiermeister, citing sexual discrimination, after she voiced opposition towards the planned AI erotica feature in ChatGPT. Beiermeister said that the allegations are “absolutely false,” while OpenAI insists that her departure was not related to any issues she raised while at the company.
___
**In lawsuits this week…**

* **Estée Lauder** filed a federal lawsuit against **Walmart**, alleging that counterfeit versions of its luxury brands were sold through Walmart’s third-party marketplace. The complaint alleges trademark infringement and unfair competition, claiming Walmart failed to adequately vet marketplace sellers, and seeks to hold the retailer liable for facilitating the sales.
* **Autodesk** is suing **Google** for allegedly infringing on its “Flow” trademark to market competing AI video production tools used to make movies, TV shows and video games. Autodesk began using Flow in Sep 2022 for visual effects, production management, and other products, and Google launched Flow software in May 2025 aimed at the same market. Autodesk is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the consumer confusion and alleged irreparable harm caused by Google.
* **The International Brotherhood of Teamsters** filed a lawsuit against **UPS** to seek a temporary restraining order against the company's next planned round of driver buyouts. The buyouts come as UPS continues its plan to downsize its network in the wake of lower volume from Amazon.
* **UPS** is suing **Temu** for €37M for unpaid delivery bills, alleging that the retailer continued placing orders without making meaningful payments between September 2024 and September 2025. Why did UPS let it go on for that long?
* In other bad news for **Temu**, the estate of **MF Doom** received judicial approval to proceed with its trademark infringement lawsuit against the company regarding the sale of counterfeit merchandise. A federal judge ruled that the amended complaint plausibly alleges the e-commerce platform is exercising direct control over the distribution and pricing of infringing goods.
* **Scale AI** filed a lawsuit against the **Department of Defense**, but it's unclear why as most of the case documents are classified. However *Business Insider* notes that Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708M from the DoD to Enabled Intelligence last all and later filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office, which was dismissed in January, so it's likely related to that.
___
**Google** gained unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $32B acquisition of **Wiz**, its biggest acquisition to date, after regulators said the deal would not raise any competition concerns. EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said, “Google stands behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of market shares in cloud infrastructure, and our assessment confirmed that customers will continue to have credible alternatives and the ability to switch providers.”
___
**Pinterest CEO Bill Ready** blamed Trump tariffs as the reason why ad revenue dropped at the company during the past year. He said, “Many of the largest retailers have been disproportionately impacted by tariffs and have been pulling back on advertising spend across the industry as they seek to protect their margins.” Ready said that he's not satisfied with Pinterest's Q4 performance, during which it fell short of Wall Street's expectations, and laid out plans to “further broaden our revenue mix and accelerate the next phase of our sales and go to market transformation.”
___
**Amazon**, **Microsoft**, and **Google** are looking to skirt President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee by finding workers in categories that don't have to pay the fee including existing H-1B visa holders, students, and workers in the US on other types of visas. The firms are also leaning on programs like Optional Practical Training, which gives foreign graduates at US universities temporary employment after graduation, and prioritizing higher-paid applicants to improve lottery odds, which are strategies that smaller startups say they can’t easily replicate, leaving them at a disadvantage under the new rules.
___
**Apple** and **Google** agreed to modify their UK app store practices to improve fairness and transparency for developers following an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. The changes include fairer ranking and review processes, safeguards around developer data, and expanded iOS feature access for competing products such as digital wallets and live translation. The commitments do not address the companies' commission fees on app sales, which can range as high as 30%, but the CMA said steering users to alternative payment methods remains under discussion. The regulator also noted that it's choosing to negotiate commitments rather than impose formal requirements under its new digital markets regime because it delivers quicker results.

Singapore has a global reputation for strict laws, efficiency, and high finance.

But business leaders who live and work there say the reality is more human than most people realize.

From startup founders sharing advice freely to major cross-border decisions being made over coffee at hawker centres, Singapore blends discipline with warmth in ways outsiders rarely see.

It’s not just a financial hub — it’s a relationship-driven ecosystem built on clarity and velocity.

1r6ljyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1r6ljyh/how_to_build_a_morning_routine_that_actually/,How to Build a Morning Routine That Actually WORKS: ScienceBased Tricks That Won't Make You Miserable,"I spent way too long thinking morning routines were just another productivity scam. You know the drill: wake up at 5 am, meditate for an hour, journal your deepest thoughts, drink lemon water, do yoga while reciting affirmations. Honestly? That shit made me more stressed than just rolling out of bed at 8:47 am and grabbing coffee on the way to work.

But here's what I've learned after reading a stupid amount of research and testing different approaches: morning routines don't suck when they're actually designed for real humans, not productivity influencers. The problem isn't you being lazy or undisciplined. Our brains are literally fighting against circadian rhythms, cortisol patterns, and decades of ingrained habits. The good news? You can work with your biology instead of against it, and build something that genuinely improves your day without feeling like torture.

Start ridiculously small. I'm talking embarrassingly small. The biggest mistake people make is trying to overhaul their entire morning in one go. Your brain hates dramatic change because it requires massive amounts of willpower, which is a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. Dr BJ Fogg, Stanford behaviour scientist and author of Tiny Habits, explains that sustainable behaviour change happens through tiny actions repeated consistently, not heroic effort. Want to start exercising? Don't commit to a 45-minute workout. Do two pushups. Want to meditate? Start with three breaths. It sounds stupid, but it works because you're removing the activation energy required to start. Once you're doing the thing, you'll often naturally do more. But even if you don't, you've still won because you've reinforced the habit loop.

Anchor new habits to existing ones. This is called habit stacking,g and it's insanely effective. Your brain already has established neural pathways for things you do automatically every morning, like brushing your teeth or making coffee. Piggyback your new habit onto an existing one. After I pour my coffee, I do five minutes of light stretching. After I brush my teeth, I write three things I'm grateful for. The existing habit acts as a trigger for the new one, so you don't have to rely purely on motivation or memory.

Optimise for your chronotype, not some guru's schedule. Not everyone is built to be a morning person, and that's completely fine. Dr Michael Breus, clinical psychologist and sleep specialist, has done extensive research showing that people have different biological chronotypes. Lions wake up early naturally. Wolves are night owls. Bears follow the sun. Forcing a wolf to adopt a 5 am routine is fighting biology, and you'll probably lose. If you're naturally a night person, your ""morning routine"" might start at 10 am, and that's completely valid. The key is consistency with your wake time, whatever that is, because it regulates your circadian rhythm.

Use implementation intentions. Sounds fancy, but it just means getting specific about when and where you'll do something. Instead of ""I'll exercise in the morning,"" it becomes ""After I brush my teeth, I will do ten minutes of yoga in my bedroom."" Research by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows that this simple if-then planning roughly doubles your chances of following through. Your brain loves clarity and specificity. Vague intentions get lost in the chaos of decision fatigue.

The Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod is actually solid despite the cheesy title. Elrod survived a horrific car accident and used morning routines as part of his recovery. The book breaks down six practices (silence, affirmations, visualisation, exercise, reading, scribing) into a framework you can customise. What I appreciate is that he's not dogmatic about it. You can do the whole thing in six minutes if needed, one minute per practice. It won a bunch of awards and has sold over 2 million copies because it's genuinely practical. This book will make you question everything you think you know about what mornings can be. The audiobook version is great if you want to listen while doing your routine.

Track it somewhere visible. I use a basic habit tracking app called Streaks. It's stupid simple, but seeing that chain of completed days creates psychological momentum. You don't want to break the streak. Jerry Seinfeld famously used this method for writing jokes daily. There's also this app called Finch, where you care for a little bird that grows as you complete habits and self-care tasks. Sounds childish, but the gamification genuinely works for a lot of people. The bird gets sad if you don't check in, which is weirdly motivating without being guilt-trippy.

Another option worth checking out is [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), a personalised learning app that creates custom audio content from books, research papers, and expert insights on habit formation and productivity. You can tell it your specific struggle, like ""I'm naturally a night owl but need to build a consistent morning routine"", and it'll pull together relevant knowledge and create a learning plan tailored to your situation. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10minute overviews to 40minute deep dives with detailed examples. Plus, you get a virtual coach you can actually talk to when you need clarity or motivation. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it's like having all the productivity and behaviour science resources distilled into something that fits your commute or morning walk. Way better than doomscrolling.

Build in flexibility. Rigid routines break the moment life gets chaotic. Have a minimum viable routine for rough days. Mine is just: make bed, drink water, five-minute walk. That's it. On good days, I do way more, but I never go below that baseline. This prevents the all-or-nothing thinking that kills most routines. One bad morning doesn't have to derail everything.

Make it actually enjoyable. This sounds obvious, but people forget that if you hate every second of your routine, you won't stick with it,t no matter how ""good"" it supposedly is for you. I listen to music I genuinely love while making breakfast. I read fiction for twenty minutes with my coffee instead of forcing myself through self-help books at 6 am. Your routine should feel like something you're doing for yourself, not to yourself. Dr Laurie Santos teaches the most popular course in Yale's history about happiness, and one of her key findings is that small pleasurable rituals significantly impact wellbeing. Don't underestimate the power of just making your morning something you look forward to.

The real magic isn't in having the perfect routine. It's in having one that's so easy and enjoyable that you actually do it consistently. That's literally the only thing that matters.",1,1771275098.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False
1r6lju8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1r6lju8/i_underestimated_how_much_discipline_lives_in/,"I underestimated how much discipline lives in small, boring decisions","For a long time, I thought discipline had to feel intense to work. Big routines, strict schedules, dramatic changes. None of that ever stuck for me.

What actually helped was removing friction in small places and being more intentional with simple choices.

I stopped answering messages the moment they arrived. Even waiting a few minutes changed how reactive my day felt.

I made it harder to mindlessly grab my phone. If it wasn’t within reach, I worked longer without forcing it.

I simplified my mornings instead of “optimizing” them. Fewer decisions meant less mental resistance. Even small things, like having coffee handled by the same Tastyle single-serve machine every morning, made the start of the day quieter.

I also learned to finish something before trying to finish everything. One task done made the next one easier.

I go outside daily now, even briefly. And when I’m tired, I sleep instead of pretending scrolling is rest.

None of this feels impressive. But discipline stopped feeling like willpower and started feeling like environment and repetition.",2,1771275091.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

I'm not huge on lattes. Will likely only have 1 a week vs 2 to 3 cups of black coffee or espresso a day, so the frother component is not that huge if a deal for me but probably nice for guests and the one off latte I might have a week 

My tap runs VERY hard water though so that's a consideration I guess. 

Also while I am beginner, I'm kinda eager to learn and get into the hobbyist component of espresso making so I'm fine if it's not an all in one machine and piece mealing the other components such as tamp, grinder, etc

Budget is 200-600 but given I'll be upgrading components over time, I'd like the actual machine to be quality/reliable and easy to maintain so that I don't have to upgrade the machine itself anytime soon, only the accessories 

Outside of the above, the only thing I'd really care about too much is brewing time. Don't want to spend 10 minutes for a cup of coffee in the morning and would be nice to get a quick shot when I need a fast fix of caffeine.

""Cook for six tonight. My parents are coming over.""

Ever since he had caught me having coffee with my coworker, that asshole had been treating me like dirt.

""I want steak, lobster, the whole spread.""

Steak was thirty a pound, lobster was fifty. What was I? A magician?

He was already bragging in the family chat: 

""Sarah can work magic with a hundred bucks!""

His mom jumped in: ""Don't let her pocket any money. I want receipts!""

Six o'clock. His parents sat down expecting Gordon Ramsay.

I slammed down a bowl of plain ramen. Not even butter.

""Where's the steak? The lobster? You stole my money for your boyfriend?""

I ripped off my apron and threw it down.

""Five-star taste on McDonald's money? Enjoy your gourmet meal, jackass.""

""We're done. Let's get divorced.""

Connor's face turned red. I swore steam was coming out of his ears.

""What did you just call me?""

He shot up, about to smack me.

I didn't even flinch. ""Go ahead. Hit me.""

His hand stopped mid-swing.

His mom dropped her fork and went full drama queen.

""Jesus! What kind of garbage did you marry?""

""She's completely out of control! Calling us names!""

""My poor baby worked his butt off while she was out s1utting around!""

All this because I had had coffee with my coworker. One coffee and suddenly I was the wh0re.

""Emma, you've lost your mind.""

Connor pointed at the sad bowl of ramen.

""A hundred bucks and this is what we get? You stole from me?""

""She spent it on her boyfriend!"" his mom shrieked.

""Check her phone! Find that asshole!""

I started laughing. These two morons were priceless.

""A hundred bucks for six people? Connor, are you high?""

""Steak was fifty a pound. You want magic tricks?""

His face went redder. ""Other wives managed just fine!""

""You didn't care about this family anymore!""

He lunged for my phone. ""Hand it over! Now!""

I shoved him back hard.

For three years I had been paying for everything. His joke of a salary went straight to mommy.

Now he wanted to audit me?

""Are you sure you want to see my bank account, Connor?""

I smiled sweetly.

""Because once you did, you’d regret it.""

Connor sneered, looking at me like I was garbage.

""Regret? Yeah, I regret marrying a lying b!tch!""

""Get her phone!"" 

His mom was going crazy. ""Time to catch this s1ut red-handed!""

I pulled out my phone and tossed it at them.

""Go for it.""

Connor grabbed it fast. His mom leaned over his shoulder, both staring at the screen.

They went straight to my texts.

The coffee guy was just some recruiter trying to get me a new job. His name in my phone just said ""Mr. Peterson.""

Our messages were boring work stuff. A few short calls, that's it.

""Where's all the cheating stuff?"" His mom kept scrolling.

""She deleted it all! Smart little b!tch!""

Connor was looking through my bank app now.

""One hundred bucks... one hundred...""

He was looking for proof I stole his money.

Then he saw my bills. His face went white.

Mortgage: $2,800.

His mom's doctor visits: $650.

Internet: $400.

Everything paid by me.

His hundred dollars looked stupid sitting there.

Connor's hands started shaking. ""What is this?""

I just watched him freak out.

""Those are called bills, Connor. Grown-ups pay them.""

""Your tiny paycheck barely buys your mom's vitamins.""

His mom went nuts. ""She's lying! This is all fake!""

""She doesn't make this much! She's obviously sleeping around for—""

""Mom, stop!"" Connor's face was bright red.

He turned to me. ""Where's this money coming from?""

""You said you were nobody at work!""

""Nobody makes this much! What are you really doing?""

I looked at this loser and felt nothing.

He thought if I made money, I must be cheating.

""Connor, does your wife being better than you hurt that much?""

I took my phone back.

""You think I'm dirty? Fine. We're done.""

""Let's get divorced.""

Those three words hit like a bomb. The room went dead.

Then his mom exploded, cackling like a maniac.

""Divorce? Ha! Did you hear that, baby? She wants a divorce!""

""What are you gonna be without us? Garbage! Used goods!""

""This is MY son's house! You'll leave with nothing, you hear me? NOTHING!""

Connor straightened up, acting all high and mighty again.

""Emma, quit the divorce bullsh!t. Who wants damaged goods like you?""

""We paid for this place. Yeah, your name's on some papers, but you ain't getting sh!t.""

I stared at these two psychos. Absolutely insane.

They threw down sixty grand. I've been paying the three-hundred-thousand mortgage plus everything else.

Wanna play? Let's play.

""Fine. Keep your stupid house.""

Marched to the bedroom.

""But my stuff's coming with me.""

Started shoving clothes in my suitcase. My laptop, skincare, whatever. One bag, that's all I needed.

They watched like I was putting on some circus act.

""Where you gonna sleep tonight, s1ut?""

His mom kept spitting seeds everywhere like a pig.

Connor was grinning. ""Let the b!tch go! She comes crawling back, I'll kick her butt to the curb!""

Ignored them. Reached for my expensive face cream.

His mom charged like a bull.

""Hey! That's not yours!""

Grabbed the jar right out of my hands.

""My son paid for that!""

I snatched it back. ""This costs three thousand bucks. Your precious son makes three thousand a month. You do the math.""

""Liar! You're just some nobody! Where'd you get money for fancy sh!t?""

Her eyes went crazy greedy as she stole it back.

""Your boyfriend bought this! It belongs to us now!""

Connor stepped in my way.

""Mom's right. Wanna leave? Everything valuable stays.""

""That coat, that bag - we paid for all of it.""

""Don't you dare steal from us.""

Looking at his smug face made me wanna puke.

""Want it all?""

""Fine. Take it.""

Ripped off my coat, threw it at him. My bag went flying.

""There's your precious sh!t.""

Off came my jewelry, my watch. Everything hit the floor.

""Want my shoes too?""

""My bra?""

Started pulling at my shirt like I'd strip right there.

Connor's eyes went huge. He was practically drooling over my stuff.

""Okay! Jesus! You made your point!""

Waved his hands around.

""Just get out! You picked broke, remember that!""

His mom was squeezing into my coat, bursting at the seams.

""So soft! It's mine now!""

Grabbed my suitcase. Just a thin shirt in the freezing cold, but I felt good.

""Emma!""

Connor screamed as I hit the door.

""Don't think you can run away and come back! You want in? You better grovel to my mom!""

""And every penny you make goes to us!""

I stopped. Didn't look back.

""Enjoy being rich, Connor. Won't last long.""

SLAM. That hellhole was history.

Whipped out my phone.

""Mr. Peterson? Emma here.""

""That job? I'm in.""

""Oh, and get me the meanest divorce lawyer you know. Time to destroy some people.""

The past few days, I'd been crashing at my old office building.

Today was my last day as deputy director before my big promotion.

Walked into the lobby and the receptionist came sprinting over.

""Ms. Williams! Your husband's here with his mom! They're going absolutely crazy!""

Great. They found me fast. Must be hurting without my cash flow.

Headed to the lounge. Connor and his psycho mom were sprawled across our leather couches.

She was bursting out of my designer coat, looking like a stuffed sausage.

Everyone was staring. These two idi0ts were loving the attention.

Connor spotted me and jumped up.

""Emma! There's my cheating wife!""

His mom started howling.

""Look everyone! This s1ut destroys families! How can you employ this wh0re?""

The whole lobby was watching our soap opera.

I walked right up to them.

""This isn't Jerry Springer. Get out.""

Connor went ballistic.

""Get out? You think you're better than us now?""

He grabbed my wrist, squeezing hard.

""You're coming home! Mom wants pot roast tonight!""

""Let go.""

""No way! You're MY wife!""

His grip tightened. His mom came at me with her claws out.

""I'll teach you to cheat, you little b!tch!""

Security moved in.

""Touch me and I'll own this building!"" his mom shrieked, throwing herself on the floor.

Security hesitated. Connor got cocky.

His eyes landed on our million-dollar architectural model. Three weeks of work. Our whole future.

""Think this job's so important?""

Evil smile spread across his face.

""Let's see how important it is now!""

He grabbed a fire extinguisher and WHAM! Smashed our masterpiece to pieces.

Glass everywhere. Model destroyed.

Everyone went silent.

""Destroy it all!"" his mom screamed, hurling a vase.

Connor turned to me, grinning like a maniac.

""No more job! Now you'll come home like a good little wife!""

I stared at the wreckage. Straightened my jacket. Walked up to him.

""Nice work, Connor.""

Pulled out my phone. Started filming the destruction, then zoomed in on their proud faces.

""Just curious - can you afford a five-million-dollar lawsuit?""

His grin vanished.

""Five million? It's just... it's plastic!""

I nodded to security.

""Lock it down. Call the cops.""

Smiled at Connor.

""Nobody leaves until this is settled.""

1r6lb0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/festivals/comments/1r6lb0l/review_bahidora_in_mexico_is_the_best_festival/,Review: Bahidora in Mexico is the best festival you've never heard of,"Hi folks, just got back from [Bahidora festival in mexico](https://www.bahidora.com/) and I have this feeling I have to tell the world about it. It's incredible. The review is going to be a bit ""gushy"" so I hope you can forgive that.

**Who it's for:**

If you're into carefully curated electronic acts + a bit of world music, this is for you. As an example, the headliners this year were Ricardo Villalobos, Four Tet & Daphni (Caribou). Second billing went to Kings of Convenience, the Mad Professor, Helena Hauff, and the Giegling Collective.

**What makes it great**

**The vibes and the location.** It's located in ""Las Estacas"", a nature paradise 3 hours from Mexico City. The festival is placed around a beautiful cristalline river, surrounded by nature, and people are just in the best mood. 

You can float down the river before heading into the stages at night, chill under the trees, etc. It really is beautiful.

One of my favorite moments was watching the Kings of Convenience ditch their clothes to laze down the river after playing an (excellent) show.

**Not so globalized** It's a bit strange to say this but a great thing about it is that it feels both international (obviously bc of the talent) but also Mexican. There were mexican ""sonideros"" playing as well (think the modern version of jamaican sound systems) and the crowd is 85% mexican 15% foreign. As a result it has a differnt vibe than ever other festival and is obviously better for it.

**The music** The curation is legitimately top notch. Almost every act is world-class. Also, it seems like the musicians are happy to be there, and they are energized by the atmosphere. They tend to put on amazing shows.

Best vibes + Best Music

**The merely good**

The festival is super well organized. It's clean. The staff is mega friendly. The food is also really good and shows legit curation: a mix of hip mexico city spots + well known street food.

I can't speak for the camping situation, but the lodging is pretty good (the ""glamping"" is great, and there is a hacienda you can get to by a shuttle that runs every half hour).

The cashless system is nice. You load up your wristband and so you can leave your wallet/everything in your room or tent and not have to worry about your wallet (but see the bad section).

**The bad:**


- Logistics. It's FAR from mexico city and there is no public transit. I _think_ they offer some sponsored buses to/from mexico city but it wasn't clear how they work.
- Breakfast! The food is excellent but it's mostly geared towards lunch/dinner. There is ONE booth that sells coffee and pastries and the lines are crazy. 45 minutes + to get a nice cup of coffee.
- Agenda. There are so many cool things happening on the grounds (classes, saunas, yoga, even a pingpong tournament) but there's no way to figure out what's going on. They don't publish an agenda for the weekend so you sort of stumble onto stuff.
- The cashless system. Yes, it works great, but the refund system is a huge PITA so you're constantly worried about loading in too much/too little.

We're both international students so we sort of hit it off pretty early on in our program. But she is an extrovert and I'm very much not one. So she basically just ""adopted"" me. Initially I was fine with it, we'd get coffee and talk about our lives. Our personal lives outside of work stayed separate, just the way I like it. I like compartmentalizing my friends into work friends, hobby friends etc. 

But she started getting overbearing real quick. She'd constantly come over to my office or my lab and yap for an hour while I'd try to work. She'd ask me to go to things I have no interest in. We have no common interests whatsoever so I'd politely decline but she'd keep doing it. Every conversation would be all about her and her boy problems. She'd subtly compare her body with mine (not being snarky but she's very overweight and I'm pretty lean and fit). She would take credit for the success of my current relationship (like what???). 

Things started getting really bad mid 2025 when we were both preparing for our candidacy exams (basically the most important exam during your PhD). She started to come to annoy me at my lab more often, bragging about how prepared she was for the exam (while I was stressed and working 13 hours a day). I started working from home more often just to avoid the yap sessions. She started calling herself my ""obsessive stalker ex"" because of how often she tried to reach out to me and how I'd avoid her. Then she did something so completely shitty that I almost broke down. She came crying to me while I was teaching a class, entered the classroom while my students were still working and started yelling about her breakup. And on the day of my candidacy exam, two hours before I'd have to present to my committee, she came to cry to me about the same thing and how she hooked up with her ex. 

I'm not sure why I stayed friends with her after that. Recently she sent me a long text accusing me of hurting her feelings by not spending more time with her and basically called me a bad friend. I apologized and made an effort to spend more time with her but the conversations have been completely centered about her once again, with comments about my body and I feel like I'm going insane. I have started hating all human interaction and I feel like I hate all extroverts now. I feel like I'm becoming Larry David lmao. ",2,1771274509.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

Dad was alcoholic and used to hit my mom, and mom was abusive with words. Fights were just regular. Basically, Domestic violence was prevalent. That’s my childhood.

And after 19, I just started working at various companies for 10+ years. Never really had a loving relationship with women. Had friends, went on trips, used to drink, smoke etc. I thought I was having a great life.

Finally, something happened when I was about hit 30. An incident so strong that it hit me like a bus, a car. It turned my life upside down completely.

I FUCKING NEVER KNOW ABOUT MYSELF.

I never knew that people could feel like really FEEL. When someone says something to me or treat me badly, I wouldn’t say anything back because I never felt bad.

I didn’t know what it means to like a person too. I used to think or obsess over a person and think that that’s love.

I used to let people treat me like trash, scold me, say whatever they want, and I still used to stick with them because I never felt hurt.

And my dumbass brain thought everyone is like this only. How would I know?  
Would a blind person from birth understand what it means to see?

That incident happened, that’s it. I fucking prayed for myself every day.

I understood bit by bit about myself. I understood that my mind was completely disconnected with my body and suffering from complex PTSD. My brain was fucked/fried.

First time I felt something in my heart(Like a tinge) when I signed a monthly donation for poor kids.

I stopped smoking, weed. Gradually, my thought process changed. I set up fucking boundaries with people.

I realised I hate myself so much, how I let myself be treated like that, so much anger that I screamed top of my lungs on the mountains.

I understood my sensitivity, a bit by bit. Everything and everyone used to make me upset and angry. Small things - started affecting me.

I started blocking people for not replying to me. I used to stay mad for weeks at my friends :P

I prayed more, meditated more, went to Vipasana meditation, and ayahuasca healing ceremonies.

I quit alcohol, coffee, stopped Insta, and stopped watching movies(my eyes hurt if I spend too much time on screen). I started playing drums again - I left them after my mom’s death.

Today, i am still and will be sensitive but i am gradually becoming more and more confident in myself. Developing trust in myself and my decisions.

**TLDR**:

**Guys, All this I am sharing because I FUCKING NEVER want to see any one of you in depression, that too for many years.**

**I cannot change you(whoever is reading this), but I will fucking listen to you and try my best to understand you.**  
  
**But, you have to do all the hardwork. You cannot escape it nor find a shortcut with meds.**

**Be brave.**  
**Don’t ignore your feelings. If you are mad, you are mad. If you are angry, you are. If you are sad, then you are. If you want to cry, then fucking cry your heart out.**  
 **Don’t let anyone tell you that you are intense.**  
**Accept the way you are, guys. You are all gems. Be patient and treat yourself with some love and care.**  
**IF someone doesn’t accept you, then it’s time to move on from that relationship. Even if your mind screams not to do it, you do it.**  
**Take the boldest of the boldest decisions and stick to it. Don't look back. Challenge the fucking world, you lovely MF's.**

1r6l7rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1r6l7rf/10_psychological_tricks_that_command_respect_in/,10 Psychological Tricks That Command RESPECT in Any Room (Science-Based),"Real talk: I used to walk into rooms and feel invisible. Like I was just background noise while everyone else seemed to naturally own the space. Thought it was just my personality, that some people are born with ""it"" and others aren't.

Turns out that's bullshit. After diving deep into psychology research, behavior science podcasts, and books on social dynamics, I realized respect isn't about being the loudest or most charismatic person. It's about understanding how human brains actually work and using that knowledge strategically.

Here's what actually moves the needle, backed by research and real application:

**1. Master the pause before responding**

Most people rush to fill silence because it feels awkward. That's your advantage. When someone asks you something, take 2-3 seconds before answering. Neuroscience shows this does two things: it signals you're actually thinking (not just reacting), and it makes people lean in because they sense weight behind your words.

I started doing this in meetings and the shift was immediate. People stopped interrupting me. They started actually listening.

**2. Lower your vocal tone at the end of sentences**

This one's weird but powerful. When you raise your pitch at the end of statements (upspeak), your brain processes it as a question, seeking approval. Confident people do the opposite, they drop their tone slightly at the end. It signals certainty.

Voice coach Roger Love talks about this extensively. The difference between ""I think we should do this?"" and ""I think we should do this."" (downward inflection) completely changes how people receive your message.

**3. Take up space without apologizing**

Research from social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows that body language doesn't just communicate confidence to others, it actually changes your hormone levels. Higher testosterone, lower cortisol. But here's the key: you don't need to be obnoxious about it.

Just stop making yourself smaller. Don't cross your arms, don't hunch, don't pull your legs in tight when sitting. Claim your physical space naturally. No ""sorry"" when you set your bag down or adjust your chair.

**4. Respond to disrespect with calm curiosity**

When someone throws shade or tries to diminish you, your instinct is either to fight back or shrink. Both lose. Instead, respond with genuine curiosity. ""That's interesting, what makes you say that?"" or ""Help me understand your perspective here.""

This technique comes from negotiation research by Chris Voss (former FBI hostage negotiator, wrote ""Never Split the Difference""). It completely disarms people because you're not playing the game they expected. You stay in control while they scramble.

**5. Share credit generously but own your contributions clearly**

There's this weird balance where you need to acknowledge team effort without erasing yourself from the narrative. Research on workplace dynamics shows people respect those who can do both.

Say ""The team executed brilliantly, I focused on the strategy framework and client relationship"" instead of either ""We did it"" (too vague) or ""I did everything"" (insufferable).

**6. Maintain eye contact 60-70% of the time**

Too much eye contact reads as aggressive or intense. Too little seems weak or dishonest. Social psychology research pinpoints the sweet spot around 60-70% of conversation time.

Here's the trick: look away occasionally when you're thinking or transitioning topics, not when the other person is making their point. Looking away while they talk signals disinterest. Looking away while you're formulating thoughts signals processing.

**7. Use people's names sparingly but strategically**

Dale Carnegie was right about this in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", but most people overdo it and sound like a used car salesman. The key is strategic deployment.

Use someone's name when you're acknowledging their specific contribution, disagreeing with them (softens the blow), or at the end of a meaningful exchange. ""Thanks for that perspective, Sarah"" hits different than constant ""Well Sarah, I think Sarah, you see Sarah...""

**8. State boundaries without over explaining**

This one changed everything for me. When you say no or set a limit, resist the urge to justify it with a paragraph of reasons. Over-explaining signals insecurity about your decision.

""I can't take that on right now"" is complete. You don't owe anyone your life story about why. Therapist Nedra Glover Tawwab breaks this down brilliantly in ""Set Boundaries, Find Peace"". The book will genuinely shift how you see your right to have limits without guilt. Best boundary-setting resource I've encountered.

**9. Ask questions that make people think, not just respond**

Anyone can ask surface questions. ""How was your weekend?"" gets surface answers. But when you ask something that requires actual thought, ""What's been the most interesting challenge you've faced this month?"", you signal that you value substance.

This is about creating what psychologists call ""relational depth."" You're not just making noise, you're creating meaningful exchange. People remember conversations where they felt genuinely engaged.

**10. Follow through on small commitments religiously**

Trust research shows people judge reliability based on small things more than big promises. If you say you'll send that article, send it. If you mention grabbing coffee, follow up. If you commit to a 2pm call, be there at 1:58pm.

This builds what researchers call ""social credit."" Every small follow-through deposits credibility. Then when it matters, when you make a bigger ask or take a stand, people already trust your word.

**Bonus resource:** If you want to go deeper without spending hours reading, there's this personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews on social dynamics and communication. Built by Columbia grads and former Google team members, it creates custom audio learning plans based on your specific goals, like ""command respect as an introvert"" or ""improve workplace presence.""

You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and even pick your narrator's voice (some people swear by the smooth, confident tone for this kind of content). What's useful is it connects insights from books like ""Never Split the Difference"" and ""Set Boundaries, Find Peace"" with relevant research, so you get a more complete picture without juggling multiple sources. Makes the learning feel less like work and more like an interesting conversation during your commute.

Look, none of this is manipulation. It's understanding how human psychology actually works and using it to show up as your most effective self. The system rewards certain behaviors whether we like it or not. Might as well know the game.

The people who command respect aren't necessarily smarter or more talented. They just understand these invisible rules that nobody teaches you in school. Once you see them, you can't unsee them.",1,1771274343.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

I was driving home after visiting a client in a town 80 miles away. It had been a long day and I struggled to stay focused on the road. The gray vapour engulfed my car like the breath of some otherworldly creature. I knew right away that I wouldn’t make it home. I needed to find somewhere to rest. 

Not being familiar with the area, I crept through the fog, eyes wide, until a neon sign flickered at me: 

B E E P   B E E P   M O T E  L

V A C A N C Y

The Y in vacancy crackled, threatening to give out. I pulled into the parking lot - it was empty except for an ancient pickup truck tucked in a corner. The motel itself looked so rundown I wondered if it was abandoned - until I noticed the office light. 

This was far from a dream accommodation, but it would do for one night.

The tiny office smelled of microwaved food and cigarette smoke. No one was behind the desk. My eyes fell on a brochure rack displayed on a rickety table. Through the yellowed paper, a group of friends smiled at each other as they strolled through a theme park, drinks in hand… A sharp pang shot through my body. I immediately looked away and rang the bell. 

To my surprise, the manager walked in immediately, as if he had been waiting behind the door. He was a willowy man of undetermined age who looked like he hadn’t showered in a while. He glanced up at me from under his brow, shyly, and whispered: “Welcome to the Beep Beep Motel.”

“Can I have a room for tonight?” I asked impatiently. 

“Most certainly. Room 6?” He handed me a key with slender hands. His nails were upsettingly long. “It’s the last room on the ground floor. Breakfast is served in the office from 6 am to 9 am.”  He pointed at a crusty coffee machine. “I’m afraid we don’t have the internet. Check-out is whenever you need. Enjoy your stay. ”

This must be the seediest motel in town, I thought. He hadn’t even asked me for an ID. I grabbed the key and hurried toward my room. I passed a small service area: there was a coin laundry, a nearly empty vending machine, and… I stopped short. A phone booth. I hadn’t seen one in decades.

A faded sign hung on the outside: *Come Inside! Try Our World-Famous Afterlife Phone!*

I couldn’t imagine anything in this motel being “world-famous.”

“You noticed it.” 

I jumped. The manager was standing right there, watching me.

“Hum, yeah?” 

“Our guests’ favorite feature.” He smiled an almost charming smile. Little gray teeth appeared between his lips. His eyes glimmered.

“What’s an afterlife phone?”

“Just like the name says, it’s a phone to call the Afterlife. If you speak into it, your loved ones on the other side will hear you.”

“Is that right?” I snickered. But inside, my heart skipped a beat.

“That’s absolutely right.”

“And do they talk back?”

The man cocked his head to the side. “Maybe.”

“Not sure?”

“Depends if they have something to say.”

“How convenient.” With a smirk, I walked away.

The room was the kind that seems acceptable at first glance, but upon closer inspection, filth starts popping up everywhere: dust on the surfaces, stains on the carpet, an unidentified sticky substance on the door handles… I lay on the bed fully clothed, suspecting bugs were hiding in the wrinkles of the sheet. 

A stagnant smell rose from the pillow and drifted into my nostrils - this would not help with my insomnia. I forced my eyes closed. After ten years of sleep disturbance, I learnt that if I will my body into stillness, sleep will eventually come, if only for a couple of hours. 

It did not. There was a restlessness in my heart that would not quiet down.

As if guided by an invisible power, I got up and walked back through the cold fog toward the phone booth.

The sliding door creaked as I stepped inside. 

I picked up the receiver. Unsurprisingly, the phone was disconnected - yet it didn’t sound dead. The silence that emanated from it was deep and enveloping. Comforting somehow, like a warm breath. I rolled my tongue around my mouth - it was dry as a desert. Would I let yet another day of silence go by? Or could this forlorn phone booth, in a forlorn motel, on a dark and lonely night, be my chance to speak? 

“Hi, Nina -” I bit my tongue, literally. I tasted blood. I thought about hanging up and walking off. I should have. But the inviting silence on the other end of the line encouraged me to continue. It dawned on me then that all I had ever wanted, this whole time, was permission to talk about her. To talk to her. 

“Can you hear me?” I stammered, “How are you? Sorry, stupid question… I’m sorry I didn’t go to your funeral… I never forgot you. That’s what I wanted to say. I never forgot you. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about you, I swear. I remember your smile that afternoon, before it - I’m sorry I didn’t come to your funeral. I could not bear to - I’m sorry, I never forgot you.”

Overwhelmed with shame, I threw the receiver back into the cradle and scrambled away.

It’s been ten years since it happened, and this whole time everyone in our friend group - Kelsey, Brandon, Chris, Alex - has been acting like she never existed. Her name is never spoken. 

But we all remember, and we all know how guilty we are. How guilty I am. 

She was a good girl. If she hadn’t started hanging out with us alcoholic bums, she would be living her life right now. I thought she was asleep that night, when I left her in the bedroom. A resting angel. I saw the cigarettes and lighter on the bed side, but I didn’t stop and think. I didn’t think of the beers she'd drunk either, because I had drunk even more. 

I went into the living room with the others and kept on drinking. Then she came down the stairs. Shrieking. A human torch.

The memory coursed through my body. I swallowed it and hid it away. 

I lay down in the dark. Surprisingly, I began to drift off to sleep. Something had changed in me: speaking her name had been like pulling a 12-inch knife from my chest - it hurt, but I felt lighter. Her face appeared in my mind’s eye. She was so close me, every detail resurrected from the fog of time…

I shot from bed. I wanted to talk to her again. With the same force that once pulled me to the bottle, I hurried back to the phone booth. 

“Nina, it’s me again. I didn’t have time to tell you back then. I love you.”

“...I know…”

I jumped. Did I really hear that? The voice was faint, coming from far, far away.

“Hello?”

“...I loved you too…”

The voice was a bit clearer now. It sounded exactly like her: youthful, quick, edged with a slight raspiness that made it so distinctive. A desperate joy exploded in my heart. 

“Nina, is that you?”

She let out a sad giggle, just like she used to do. 

I tried to tell myself that this was nothing more than a parlour trick, but my guts decided otherwise. Trick or no trick, I madly needed to talk to her.

“Nina, are you at peace?”

“... no …”

“No? You said no?”

The line crackled. 

“Nina!! Are you there? Nina!!”, I screamed, reaching for her in the strange depths of the phone line.

She came back, whispering in the distance: “... I loved you… You were supposed to protect me…”

Words and tears came tumbling out of me: “I know. I should have looked over you, I shouldn’t have left you there. I have no excuse. I had seen you smoke in bed before. I should have thought about it. I was wasted. You deserved all the good in this world - ”

“YOU LIT THE CIGARETTE YOU PIECE OF SHIT”

I jolted. All of a sudden, her voice was right by my ear. Loud and seething with hate.

“What? That’s not true -”

“I SUFFERED THE PAINS OF HELL”, she spat.

My stomach dropped. The hair on the back of my neck went up. “Nina, I know, you didn’t deserve it. Please forgive me -”

“YOU DON’T KNOW SHIT BUT YOU WILL FIND OUT.”

I jumped off. As I ran away, I heard a horrendous shriek ring out from the dangling receiver. 

I packed my stuff in a flash. Memory fragments of that night cut through my brain: Nina asleep on the bed. A cigarette between my lips. Me staggering down the stairs. Where did my cigarette go? I can’t remember. Never mind, let me get another beer. Nina coming down the stairs. A human torch. 

I drove around for hours. I wanted to escape but I didn’t know whereto. The fog got so thick I couldn’t see a thing. I swam through it, not knowing if I was still on the road, if I was still on this earth.

The crash split me in two.

Branches enveloped in white fumes are now leaning against my windshield like crying corpses. The car won’t start anymore. The doors won’t open. The windows won’t break.

The smell of gasoline is getting stronger by the second. 

I just heard a sizzle.

The gasoline is making me sick.

I heard another sizzle.

It’s so hot in here.

I think these are my last words.

I would wake up and clear emails. Reply to messages. Tidy up small admin tasks. Maybe watch something “educational” while drinking coffee.

It felt responsible.

It also kept me safely away from the one thing that actually mattered.

There was always one task I was avoiding. The hard one. The uncomfortable one. The one that would genuinely move my life forward.

A difficult project. A skill I needed to build. A conversation I kept postponing.

By the time I got around to it, my focus was gone. So I would tell myself I would hit it properly tomorrow.

Tomorrow turned into weeks.

So I made one change.

For 60 days, I was not allowed to touch anything easy in the morning.

No email. No messages. No random admin. No scrolling.

I had to start with the task I felt the most resistance toward.

The first few days were rough. My brain kept looking for an escape. I would catch myself trying to justify “quickly checking” something small.

To stop that, I started using Reload. I actually found it through a Reddit ad and the concept stuck with me. It is basically a 60 day reset that builds your daily structure for you. I set it up so my hardest task was locked in as the first block of my day, and distractions were off limits during that window.

What helped most was removing the option to drift.

I did not wake up and decide what to work on. It was already decided.

Within a couple of weeks, momentum kicked in.

Projects I had delayed for months started moving. My confidence went up because I was keeping promises to myself. The rest of the day felt easier because the heaviest thing was already handled.

Nothing dramatic happened.

I just stopped giving my best mental energy to easy tasks.

If you feel stuck, try this for 30 days.

Protect your mornings. Do the hardest thing first.

It changes more than you think.",1,1771274141.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

1r6l1j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMWX5/comments/1r6l1j0/help_on_new_x5_purchase_options/,Help on New X5 purchase options,"New to Reddit, but ive enjoyed browsing threads the last few months. I currently have a m40i(first bmw), and i am in need of a larger vehicle. We didnt have kids when i purchased the x3 and now we have two. Additionally, it is common for me to have people in my car for work. 2+ passengers in my x3 feels a little tight for longer periods of time. I spent the weekend testing x5 40i, 50e and then the mercedes GLE 450. The GLE's interior is enormous and possibly better appointed, but i think i made the decision to go with the X5. 



First question, is sensafin versus extended merino? My dealership did not have merino or tartufo interiors. I want a brown interior. I currently have beige sensatec, and it has held up immensely well to scratches etc, but i also have transfer from jeans/belts, and some patina on door handles. I clean my interior monthly, but it is stuff that i simply cannot improve on at this point. I read through the pages on the bimmerpost thread, and i dont know that i came away with a definitive answer between the two. I hate how much i sweat in my sensatec seats in the summer, and they have a pretty bare bones appearance without any form of stitching etc. It was 50° over the weekend, so i didnt test if Sensafin improves on the sweat factor. They definitely look better, and didnt feel terrible. I like coffee, but still need to find tartufo in person. Tartufo would require me to go merino. Is there a significant difference in the summer sweat factor? Two, would that be negated with the ventilated seats? My salesman admitted BMW's ventilated seats are underwhelming. Three, should i be concerned with merino leather and kids+dogs? The latter's nails concern me slightly. Not that they are in my car frequently, but they are the original babies and are never left behind for vacations/long weekends. They have never marked up my sensatec. 

  
Second question, tips/timing on achieving an aggressive deal. For example, even if i love tanzanite+tartufo, if it means saving $6-8,000+ on a manhattan green+coffee X5, then i am going that direction. All to say, i do not have must-have options beyond M Sport. M Sport professional and Comfort Climate would be my next 'like to have' options. When i bought my m40i, i feel like i crushed it. I have a car in my #1 exterior color and a #2 interior color with some of the options i wanted. I ended up 19% off msrp, 0.9% financing, and then another $5-7,000 in incentives. Before taxes, i was $43,000 for that car that had an msrp of $63,750. It was a loaner with 3500 miles from about 4 hours away. I shipped it for $300 to my house. I now see incentives are basically nil, which has me re-thinking a similar strategy. Are loaners still a good strategy or should i look for '25 or '26 X5's under 10,000 miles? I can finance, but i also dont have to finance. I know i wont achieve similar results on this buy, but $85+ after taxes for  a non-M is effing crazy for my feeble mind to consider. Now that i am good with the X5, im likely going to start pinging dealerships with offers on instock inventory. If it is like last time, half will tell me eff off without a counter and half will counter.  Beyond that, is there a time in the next 3-4 months that would be worth waiting on?

**Query Letter**

Dear \[Literary Agent\],

When Jamie Tucker ran away to become a pop star, he didn't expect to fall for his bandmate… or to discover that bandmate is an android owned by the corporation that controls them both.

Against his traditional parents' wishes, 16-year-old Jamie left home to audition for Electric Entertainment, the record label behind the biggest boy bands in the world. He knew they'd never take a chance on an anxious, queer kid from rural Tennessee, so he turned himself into the confident ladies' man Electric was looking for. Now, he's living his dream, performing to screaming fans as a member of Trax. 

Jamie thinks he’s found a kindred spirit in TJ, an awkward but talented boy with the most beautiful eyes Jamie has ever seen. He and TJ are on their way to becoming fast friends (and maybe more) when Jamie makes a shocking discovery: TJ is actually TJ1011, an android prototype designed to do anything and everything necessary to make people fall in love. Jamie is determined to hate TJ, but he can’t help but be drawn in by the android’s increasingly un-android-like behavior. He expresses fear about having memories deleted and his personality reprogrammed. The emotions he performs onstage are starting to bleed into his everyday existence. And he has a little glitch he calls “the Jamie bug,” where his circuits light up every time Jamie smiles. 

When Jamie discovers that the label plans to exploit TJ's inability to refuse commands for increasingly sinister purposes, he must decide whether saving this boy with a heart of titanium is worth losing everything he left home to find.

Told in alternating perspectives, CROSSED WIRES is an 81,000-word YA romance with a sci-fi twist that explores identity, consent, and authenticity in a world obsessed with image. It blends the voice-driven grounded sci-fi of *The Extraordinaries* by TJ Klune with the boy band drama and closeted romance of *If This Gets Out* by Sophie Gonzales & Cale Dietrich.

I've spent my career writing about characters who don't fit the molds they're placed in, from \[personally identifiable info about my produced TV episodes\]. As a queer, pagan writer, CROSSED WIRES lets me explore what I know best: the performance required to survive and the courage it takes to stop performing.

By Sami Ghazagh, Founder of Altai Origin","Shilajit is not just another supplement; it is a geological miracle that has traveled through time. Today, I want to share the history, the hidden usage in modern sports, and why we are on the verge of the ""Shilajit 2.0"" era.

# 1. The Roots: Who used it first?

For thousands of years, **Shilajit** (or *Mumiyo*) was the cornerstone of **Ayurvedic medicine** in India and traditional practices in China. Ancient texts described it as the ""Conqueror of Mountains and Destroyer of Weakness."" It was used by Himalayan villagers and monks for longevity and stamina long before modern science could explain its **Fulvic Acid** and mineral density.

# 2. The Secret Weapon of Soviet Olympians 🏋️‍♂️🇷🇺

In the recent past, it was revealed that **Russian Olympic athletes** and special forces used Altai Shilajit as their ""secret weapon."" They relied on it for **muscle recovery**, bone density repair, and managing physical stress without synthetic drugs. This is why our sourcing from the **Altai Mountains** is so significant—it carries that legacy of elite performance.

# 3. The ""Silent"" Explosion in the USA 🇺🇸

While it feels like Shilajit is everywhere on social media, it currently only covers about **5% of the US market**. It is still a ""virgin territory.""

* **Why the boom?** People are tired of synthetic boosters and are turning back to **natural wellness**.
* **Why only 5%?** Because the market is still learning to distinguish between ""marketed powders"" and **authentic resin**. In India and China, it remains a staple, but in the modern fast-paced world, people are waiting for more convenient ways to consume it.

# 4. Welcome to Shilajit 2.0: The Future of Consumption ☕🥤

Currently, the world is using **Shilajit 1.0**—raw resin in jars that can be messy to dose. But the industry is shifting.

* **Shilajit 2.0** is the integration of this mineral powerhouse into our daily lifestyle. Soon, you won't just see it in jars; you will see it in your **morning coffee**, pre-mixed energy drinks, and functional beverages.
* At **Altai Origin**, we are already bridging this gap by offering [Shilajit tablets](https://altaiorigin.com/en/products/comprimes-shilajit-pur-altai-gold-60-tablettes) and high-purity resin that blends seamlessly into a modern routine.

# 5. Industrial & Wholesale Opportunities 🏭

For the visionaries who want to lead the Shilajit 2.0 movement—whether you are a beverage manufacturer or a large-scale distributor—we provide the raw material at an industrial scale. We offer [bulk Altai Shilajit](https://altaiorigin.com/en/products/shilajit-pur-1kg-grossiste) in:

I grew up not remembering ever seeing my parents being affectionated to each other, my mom told me when I was 8yo that my father forced himself on her for years. Even as a kid than left a mark on me,as an adult,thiking of it now it’s fucking terrifying.I understand she didn’t have much people around and this is not something you tell someone out of blue but I was a child.

I grew in na abusive and weird [house.My](http://house.My) father rarely spoke with me, my brother died before I was born and when my mom got pregnant with me he wanted to give me (if I was a boy) the same name as my brother…they only found my gender on the day of my birth,my father was with my grandma and my mom told me she called him afterwards to reveal the gender,once she told him I was a girl he signed and passed the phone to my grandma.She only said she heard him telling her “It’s a girl…” in a disappointed tone. My grandma tried to fix this by saying “Don’t worry,he will love her the same” to me mother.

As I was growing up, my father’s family gifted me boy’s clothes and boy’s toys. I loved the toy’s but I was a girly girl atleast when it came to dressing,so I hated the clothes. It only stopped when I started to grow into my body.Nobody gifted me clothes after that.

My poor dad probably needed therapy after my brother died (he had a marriage before my mother, my brother died when he was 6yo and the cause was cerebral [palsy.Rest](http://palsy.Rest) in peace,big brother) but never had it,not that he believes in it anyway. Can’t even tell him about my depression,autism and I’m still waiting to get accessed for ADHD and PTSD.  I couldn’t hate my dad,even after everything. He tried his best but he didn’t know how. He told me once, after my relationaship ended that I’m a dificult person, that I must have cheated and he was sad for the guy. I remember him choking my mother in the kitchen after dinner once and remember him,this is so graphic and disgusting to write but I need to fkn getting everything out my chest, groping my mom under her shirt,the shirt was loose and I saw him squeeze her nipple. He didn’t care that I was next to them.  
This never happen again and tbh I don’t remember any other time my father was sexually inappropriate. He also never tried to do something to me, always, to his best hability felt he tried to protect me. Unfortunately the man has the emotional sensitivity of a cabbage.

My breats grew at 10. I kinda have big breats,nowdays I use a sport bra to make them seem smaller. I loged for friends but was fucking weird.  
When I was eleven, I was crossing a road with my mom. Felt pretty,was wearing a yellow tube top with a bow in the middle, a headband,jeans and some all stars my parents gave me for my birthday.What they lacked in love and affection they tried to give in gifts. I like to think I still look like a child at 11yo. I will never forget this,some guys in a red car started to tell me to lift the top. My mom said to ignore them. They were laughing and were definitely older than 18.

Didn’t had attention at home,my grandma always said I was manipulative,weird and whiny (autism), father ignored me and mother was to depressed to give a shit. I would always follow the mean girls that treated me like crap.  
But boys, boys gave me attention,at the time I thought it was friendship. I noticed the more I showed the more they spoke to me. I longed for friends and attention and they gave it to me. From 12 to 14 and then from 19 to 22 I dressed in a way to show my body.  
I used my appearance as a way to connect with people,relied on my looks (I’m not saying I’m a 10,far from it but I had a big chest and it was enough) because in my mind I was stupid, dumb, annoying, uninteresting (I though at the time,don’t have this mindsent anymore.) They were super cool and spoke a lot,asked questions,would be near me,give me attention,planning to go out! Till…the sexual questions,the straightforward compliments,asking to come to their house… Everytime I met a guy I though it wouldn’t happen and it did.They weren’t interested in me as a person,didn’t care at all,jsut in what they could get from me. It traumatized me over and over and it was my fault but I can’t read people well.

I donated all my old clothes,nowdays I don’t show cleavage or use stuff that it’s too tight. I’m scared to be seen as sexual ,as a fantasy. Don’t want people to think about me in that way,it makes me disgusting and sick,a weird feeling in my body when i think of [it.Like](http://it.Like) shame mixed with something else?

I used to feel jealous of other gitls because I was scared they would take my “friends”(before they accused themselves of only being my “friends” to sleep with me).The other girls were so much more interesting,intelligent,could hold a conversation,had hobbies and interesting topics.More complete,not defected. I was afraid to be replaced, coudln’t compete with them. I was scared to be left behind,like my parents did to me. I only had my body.  
I would go home and lock myself in my room,have been basically educated by the internet.Couldn’t keep a hobbie so would just waste my time navegating on the internet.I isolated a lot and it didn’t help with the communication. But I knew I wasn’t enough.

If I’m being honest,I never and I’m not interested in sex. I had two boyfriends,had sex because I felt like it was the expected thing to do. Felt I need to have sex to recieve love. I see myself as assexual and hope one day to be in a relationaship where sex isn’t important. But I used to runway from this,tried to hard to make sexual jokes and speak about sexual things because I though it would make me normal and I would “cure” this.     
I never fantasized about sex either, with no one.But ofc I would tell people I did. I feel attraction but I don’t feel sexual attraction,if that makes sense? I had crushes but I didn’t wanna have sex with them. Remember saying something along those lines to a friend when I was 12 and she called me bizarre(she was older and sexual active). Never spoke about this to anyone till 2 weeks ago to my psychiatrist but I know it and finally admited it to myself two years ago.I wanted to surpress this part of myself by sexualizing myself and forcing myself to engage in the topics. Hell,I even used to, if someone send me a message , send a print to the person with a “incognito” page open and would say “aha you caught me watching porn!” Randomly. So quirky. And did this till my early twenties!Fuck. My fantasies consisted of holding hands and kissing in bed, after that we went to sleep,cuddling lol  
Feels so good to finally accept this part of me.

I feel my lying steemed from low-self esteem (would exagerate things to be interesting and have something to talk about) and fear (I had to lie at home). Autism made hard for me to genuine connect,I couldn’t speak in groups due stress or fear,would close myself to people because I would be scared to make a fool out of myself and people wouldn’t like me anymore. This reminds me,when I was in primary school we went to a museum and at the end we had 8 diferent fears and they gave us each other a token to place in front of the fear we had. Fears like,”scared of height”,”scared of clows”…and the second one,my biggest fear “scared of people not liking me” and the drawing was a girl being made fun of by three people. I wasn’t the last one to place the token but I saw my colleagues before me placing the tokens. I was so surprised nobody had the same fear as me. It was my turn and I place the token,the kids after me also had mundane fears. I was the only one that had chosen that one. Our caretaker,placed her token on the “scared of people not liking me” and made a funny/sad [face.Like](http://face.Like) pretend to cry and he laughed. The next day my mom said she told her when my mom went to pick me up I had choosen that fear and to keep an eye of me. I felt she choose to place the token there to make me feel more confortable. Wonderful person.

If not mistaken my parents didn’t have sex,or atleast very rarely after I was 10. I slept with my mom till I was 14yo, never though nothing of it. I started to sleep late at night and waiting to have my own privacy so I remember her sleeping on the couch. I think once or twice she slept in my dad’s (yes,my dad’s,not parent’s) room and I can imagine what she had to do. My poor mother, my poor dad.What a fkn mess. Although I like to be alive, this people shouldn’t had procreated together.It’s a paradox.  
My mom slept with me to avoid my dad, I only had this realization as an adult.

At 14yo I developed anorexia. My lowest weight was 91Ibs at 5’3. I remember my mom crying,remember her breaking a plate of food but those time were a blur. I isoleted and my grades lowered.I remember I wouldn’t eat anything for two weeks and then would drink a cup of vegetable milk and a green apple,I remember it had to be specifically green for some reason. I would drink green tea everyday which would accelerate my heartbeat and would do some 90's 8 minute exercicises on youtube. I remember writing somewhere “I preferer to die trying to be skinny than be alive and fat” and truly believed and wanted [that.](http://that.It) As an adult,it makes me sad for little me.

Once every 3 months I would allow myself half a chocolate bar on Saturday (my parents weren’t home on Saturdays) and the other half I would throw away. Tried to vomit several time, would even mix salt with water (read it would make me vomit) and driking it but don’t ever remember being able too. I was obssessed with seeing the number go lower and lower.

I wonder now if I was trying to regain control in some way inside my home.

Years later I had a friend, she was nice but had mood swings,maybe due insecurity although I believe now she was under a lot of academic pressure.  
One day we were talking and she mention she wanted to lose weight and I just said it was easy,she just need to count the calories. I regret it to this day. This,mixed with the pressure, self image issues and perfectionism (she was extremely perfectionist) manage in a mental break down. She fell apart.She was a difficult person but I liked her in the beggining,I had my faults and he were both toxic and co-dependent. Everytime she snapped at me I liked her a little less but my biggest fault is communication. I would silentely resent her to the point I didn’t saw her as a friend anymore and acted cold and uninteresded,frankly because I was but I felt I couldn’t step back because we were in the same school and hobbies. It’s enterely my fault and I apologise.  
She never knew how I felt so she though I was acting fake towards and in a way,I guess I was? I didn’t wish harm on her but I resented some things. Next time I saw her she was skinny,very skinny. It made me have those thoughts again,for months after that I would punish myself and eat once a day.If I ate more,I felt guilty and cried. I cut myself at some point, became obsessed with the scale again. I never told this to anyone,not even her. I didn’t manage to became as skinny as before and I saw this as a failure.  
This is the part I feel we parted ways.  
I think now how much suffering she was in. She tried to kill herself and I found through someone (thank god she didn’t) but I was so sick,so triggered,at same time mad with her because of the long messages she would send me insulting me ,blaming me for the tiniest [things.One](http://things.One) time she asked me before I left the house to bring a specific thing,I probably got tangled with other stuff and I forgot to bring it. I told her I forgot and she said I did it on purpouse and was a liar, with a very angry voice,the one she always used when she was mad.I know this seems minor,and it fucking is but it was a constant burst of “I hate you you are the worst person ever” to then apologise. I didn’t know how to deal with this,we never resolved issues in my family, Oh I screamed at you and you are sad? Well,I’m just gonna start talking to you like nothing happened. This is how we “fixed” things in my family.We never spoke about what made us angry,what we did wrong,how we hurt the other person. Was fight and then pretend nothing happen and I feel that,mixed with other things, really harmed my relationships with others. Mix fear of conflint autism gives me and the lying mechanism I had to learn to survive and it was a recipe to disaster.

But what I said to that is something I regret to this day,it haunts me how I could have said this about someone,I feel deeply ashamed but I said “I wish she had died”.I’m so so sorry. Typing this makes me disgusted about myself,makes me want to cry,makes me mad.We both had out faults but she didn’t deserve what I said. Wherenever you are,I hope you are happy,I hope your family is happy and that you kicked anorexia in the butt. I hope you don’t feel depressed anymore,have good friends around you and a good job because you did put the hard work.May you get a lifetime of happiness and everything you wish and I’m sorry.

Eventually I managed to get better at 15yo and was almost back to “normal” by 16yo,although I don’t think this disease ever goes away,even nowdays,the medication I’m taking since January already made me lose 6 kilos because I’m not hungry,at all. I have been eating between 480 to 800 calories a day. I know I can’t go through this again. At the same time,in a twisted way, makes me happy. I will stop.

At 15yo a man rubbed himself agaisnt me in the bus,I was with my mom I felt his member grow agaisnt my butt,the bus was crowded and I was terrified. I had purple hair,4 facial lips piercing and dress very goth.Most people looked at me weird and guys wanted nothing to do it me,so in a way I felt safe before this experience. Luckly he had to leave in the next stop. Once he left I told my mom what happen, she laughed and said it happens. Maybe she didn’t know what to say to me about such an umconfortable situation? I do remembering,once again, feeling small , like I was a child again begging to be seen and offered some love and reasurring from my parents, the people that supposedlylove me the most and are there to protect me.

Not all men and I want to remember some positive experiences I had:

At 18,when leaving my part-time job at midnight, while trying to cross the street a car with four men stopped,open the doors and told me to enter. Thank you kind sir, who defended and helped me . You were in yout 60’s and weren’t afraid to help me. Hope luck is always on your side.Sorry for running and not thank you at the time but I was scared.I will never forget you.

Also at 18 I got lost in the middle of a empty road,got out in the wrong place and it was the last bus but I didn’t know so I stayed in the stop hoping another one would come. It didn’t. Didn’t have money or cards with me,don’t remember why. Two guys appeared on the other side of the road,and kept looking at me,speaking to each other. I panicked,I was alone and it was dark.They started moving towards me till I saw something from the corner of my eye and it was a family. I run to them and asked for help.Turns out there was a coffee shop 10 minutes away. They took me there and the husband lend me money to get home safe. Thank you.

ALSO AT 18YO,I don’t remember your name but thank you for being so kind to me at my work and trying to help me get another part-time to help my family and put a good word for me to your boss,it didn’t work out but you tried. You weren’t doing it to get something in return. I cried when I found out about your death and knowing the details,I’m sorry you suffered.Thought about you some days ago, it’s gonna be 10 years since you died. We spoke maybe six times but you were genuine and kind to me. Rest in peace.

At 16yo I got groomed by a 25yo,already spoke about it in another post and don’t want to repeat this painful situation. After a few years or turmoil,at 22yo I remember looking in the mirror and thinking “WTF”. What had happen to me,I didn’t recognized myself. I wanted to change. For 2 years I didn’t leave the house,covered the windows and would stay in the dark. I didn’t had the opportunity to discuss this with any professional yet but I was severely paranoid, to the point I though others could hear my thoughts. Didn’t use any social media,isolated myself again. Every night before my birthday I would ask God to make me die in my sleep. Birthdays were painful. Didn’t had friends or nobody to talk to.  
At 25yo I got better and remember feeling positive on my birthday that year! Found a job a two months later and liked it very much. Was still friendless till last year, recconected with old peers and made efforts to make new ones. Feel positive,despite my depression,feel I changed as a person and to be sure I started therapy this year. Don’t lie anymore (stopped at 22,in fact I stopped most bad habits at 22) still have a lot of trouble with communication and that’s my biggest flaw but I also misinterpret a lot of things due my autism,my supervisor gets pissed at me a lot aha but we are also friends and she supports me. Her son is also special needs and this wonderfull human being was the reason I decided to get acessed.I’m very lucky to have such a patient person like her in my life, sometimes I feel like she treats me like a small child and Ik it’not in her nature but it’s the fact she tries to control herself with me.Thank you so much.

1r6kzqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1r6kzqw/how_to_actually_focus_in_2025_neurosciencebacked/,How to actually focus in 2025: neuroscience-backed strategies that work,"I've been studying the brains of deep workers, productivity researchers, and even monks for months now. Read every book, listened to every podcast, watched every youtube video on focus. Why? Because I was tired of feeling like my brain was rotting from constant notifications and dopamine hits. Turns out, most productivity advice is trash. Here's what actually works.

The crazy part? Our brains aren't broken. They're just hijacked by apps designed by literal PhDs in behavioral psychology whose job is to make you addicted. Companies spend billions figuring out how to steal your attention. Meanwhile, we blame ourselves for lacking discipline. Wild.

But here's the thing. Once you understand how your brain actually works, you can rewire it. Neuroplasticity is real. I'm talking peer reviewed research from neuroscience labs, not some guru's opinion. These strategies come from cognitive scientists, not motivational speakers.

## 1. understand your brain runs on glucose, not willpower

Your prefrontal cortex (the part that focuses) burns through glucose like crazy. Cal Newport talks about this in his research at Georgetown. When you're mentally exhausted, it's not a character flaw. You're literally running on empty fuel.

Fix this by timing your deep work sessions for when your glucose levels are stable. For most people, that's 2-3 hours after eating. Not right after (blood sugar spike), not 5 hours later (crash mode). Also, your brain needs breaks. The ultradian rhythm is real. Work in 90 minute chunks max, then actually rest for 15-20 minutes.

## 2. your phone is basically cocaine for your brain

Dr Anna Lembke from Stanford (she wrote ""[Dopamine Nation"") ](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/0593439356)explains how our brains adapted for a world of scarcity, not abundance. Every notification triggers a dopamine hit. Your brain craves more. Eventually, baseline dopamine drops and you need constant stimulation just to feel normal.

The solution isn't willpower. It's removing the option entirely. During deep work sessions, put your phone in another room. Not face down on your desk. Another room. Studies show just having it visible reduces cognitive capacity by 20%. Even if it's off.

I started using an app called Opal (blocks apps during set times, can't override it even if you want to). Game changer. Also Freedom app for blocking websites. You need external constraints because your willpower is finite and these apps are designed by people smarter than both of us.

## 3. your environment is sabotaging you

Research from Princeton Neuroscience Institute shows visual clutter literally overwhelms your visual cortex and reduces ability to focus. Clean workspace isn't aesthetic, it's functional.

But here's what nobody tells you. You also need environmental cues. Pick one spot that's only for deep work. Your brain will start associating that location with focus. Never scroll social media there. Never watch videos there. Only deep work. Classical conditioning isn't just for dogs.

## 4. morning routine is overrated, sleep hygiene isn't

Everyone's obsessed with waking up at 5am and cold plunges. Meanwhile they sleep 5 hours and wonder why they can't focus. Dr Matthew Walker (he wrote ""[Why We Sleep""](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316)) has spent decades researching this. If you're not getting 7-9 hours, your cognitive performance drops 30-40%. You're basically drunk.

Fix your sleep before anything else. Dark room, cool temperature, no screens 1 hour before bed, same sleep schedule every day. Boring advice but it works better than any productivity hack.

The book ""Why We Sleep"" will genuinely change how you think about rest. Walker is a neuroscience professor at Berkeley, not some wellness influencer. This is the most important thing you'll read all year. The research on sleep deprivation is actually terrifying. Read it.

## 5. single tasking is a superpower nobody has anymore

Gloria Mark at UC Irvine found it takes 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption. Most people get interrupted every 3 minutes. Do the math. You're never actually focused.

Try this. Pick ONE task. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Do only that task. No email checking. No text responding. No ""quick googling."" Just one thing. This is basic pomodoro technique but nobody actually does it properly.

The hard part isn't starting. It's not stopping when something else pops into your head. Keep a notebook next to you. When you think ""oh I should check that thing,"" write it down and keep working. You're training your brain that not every impulse needs immediate action.

## 6. boredom is actually good for you

This sounds insane but hear me out. Dr Sandi Mann (she researches boredom at University of Central Lancashire) found that boredom activates the default mode network in your brain. That's where creativity and problem solving happen.

We've eliminated all boredom from our lives. Waiting in line? Scroll instagram. Sitting on toilet? Check twitter. Your brain never gets processing time. It's like writing code but never compiling it.

Start leaving gaps. Take walks without podcasts. Sit without your phone for 10 minutes. Feels uncomfortable at first because you're basically in dopamine withdrawal. Push through. Your focus will improve dramatically.

## 7. deep work is a skill you build gradually

Cal Newport's book ""Deep Work"" is the bible here. He's a computer science professor at Georgetown who writes bestselling books without social media. The book won't give you quick hacks. It'll change how you think about attention entirely.

Newport explains deep work isn't something you just decide to do one day. It's a skill you build over months. Start with 30 minutes of focused work daily. Then 45. Then an hour. Trying to go from constant distraction to 4 hour deep work sessions is like trying to run a marathon tomorrow when you haven't exercised in years.

If you want to go deeper on focus and productivity but prefer learning on the go, there's an AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been really helpful. It pulls insights from books like ""Deep Work,"" neuroscience research, and expert interviews, then turns them into personalized audio learning based on your specific goals. You can type something like ""I'm easily distracted and want to build deep focus habits as someone who works from home,"" and it creates a structured learning plan just for you.

What makes it effective is the customization. You can switch between a quick 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive with more examples and context, depending on your energy level. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes complex neuroscience concepts way more digestible during commutes or gym sessions. It's built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-based. Worth checking out if you're serious about rewiring your attention.

The book breaks down exactly how to structure your days, how to batch shallow work, how to say no to things. It's practical and research backed. Honestly this is the best book on focus I've ever read and I've read probably 30 on this topic.

## 8. your attention span isn't destroyed forever

Here's the good news. Dr Amishi Jha (neuroscientist at University of Miami) studies attention in high stress populations like military and athletes. Her research shows you can rebuild attention through specific practices.

One that works is meditation but not the fluffy kind. Specific attention training meditation. The app ""Waking Up"" by Sam Harris teaches this properly. 10 minutes daily. You're literally doing reps for your attention muscle.

Also, read physical books for 30 minutes daily. Forces sustained attention in a way scrolling never does. Your attention span will start returning within weeks. Brain scans show measurable changes in just 8 weeks of consistent practice.

## 9. caffeine strategy matters more than you think

Most people use caffeine wrong. Dr Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford, has massive podcast) explains adenosine builds up in your brain throughout the day making you tired. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors.

But if you drink coffee immediately upon waking, you block the natural cortisol spike that wakes you up. Then you crash hard later. Instead, wait 90 minutes after waking. Your natural cortisol handles the wake up, then caffeine extends your focus window.

Also stop drinking caffeine after 2pm. It has a 6 hour half life. That 4pm coffee is still 50% active at 10pm when you're trying to sleep, destroying the sleep quality we talked about earlier.

## 10. you need a shutdown ritual

David Allen (wrote ""Getting Things Done"") talks about open loops destroying your ability to relax. Your brain keeps running background processes on unfinished tasks. This kills focus during work and prevents rest after.

Create a 10 minute shutdown ritual. Review what you did today. Write down what needs doing tomorrow. Physically close your laptop. Say out loud ""shutdown complete."" Sounds weird but it signals to your brain that work is over.

Without this, you'll keep thinking about work all evening, never fully rest, wake up mentally exhausted, and have worse focus the next day. It's a vicious cycle.

Look, rebuilding your attention span in 2025 is genuinely hard. You're fighting against billion dollar companies and your own brain chemistry. But it's possible. The research is clear. You just need to stop looking for magic solutions and start implementing boring fundamentals consistently.

Your brain is incredibly adaptable. It got hijacked by technology, but it can be reclaimed through understanding how it actually works. Start with one thing from this list. Build from there. Give it 30 days minimum before judging results.

The ability to focus deeply is becoming rare, which means it's becoming valuable. Everyone else is drowning in distraction. Meanwhile you'll be doing actual deep work. That's an absurd competitive advantage.",1,1771273838.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

39F, 1.65m 58kg... no meds.. no smoking... no drinking... 

Hi all,

I would like to start with please comebt and send some support / ideas / experiences. 

Took me a while to write this post and I wasnt sure whether to write it or not. But decided to. I know this is reddit and not a clinic but doctoes seem to be helpless at the moment and a little bit more help / advice might go a long way. Even some support. 

Last year (about 2 years ago) after taking some probiotics, miralax, peppermint oil, buscopan and penicilin on an empty stomach (doctors advice!), I started burping a lot. This is not all together, basically I had the miralax because was a bit constipated, pharmacist told.me.to take probiotics and I did and my gut went wild... the noise the intestine junping that could be felt from outside... BM ended up getting normal.after about 6 weeks but I was left with loads of instestonal noises (no pain) when I lay down.  GP told.me to try pepermint oil and buscopan and I got tonsilitis at same time there is where the other meds came from... Together with the burping sometimes I had this burny/hot feeling on my right side,  mostly behind or above the right breast, not center to the right and seems ""superficial"". It was also a time of high stress. Obviously I went for a doctor that did bloods, heart check and a chest X-Ray and was all ok so was sent away as being ""stress"". I knew it wasn't and I kept telling them maybe it was some mild form of gastritis... dismissed good bye. 

2 year forward I now have months when I have normal burping and no weird right side feeling. I dont think is gallbladder as it is not sharp pain, and it doesnt really come with fatty foods or nausea or other symptoms (well I am sure this is not gallbladder tbh). 2 weeks ago I had to take ibuprofen and there we start again, which made me again think is gastritis (I normally take ibuprofen with food), but I am.not sure if tbis wasnt coincidence. 

I tried anti-acids like rennie or tums even 1 month of lansoprazole and that just makes me nauseated (no nausea without them) and nothing else changes. 

I just have a lot of burping that seems to be generating at the chest right side. when I eat a lot and  urping comes from.stomach is different. Maybe twice a year they are wet burps, but other than that they are mostly ""dry"". I sometimes after days of burping a lot start filling my throat is ""wet"" when I burp (mucus)  But no taste, no burning, nothing. I also sometjmes namelly if I am.sitting a lot start feeling my chezt a bit tight and sometimes forcing or releasing a burp helps. 

None of this happens when I got to rest on the sofa and bed at the end of the day. when I lay down is all fine until I wake up next day and start burping as soon as I stand up and start moving. 

I tried to push for an endoscopy but where I am they dont think is necessary right now and they dont see anything concerning that would suggest I should be refered to that. I did do a H Pilory breath test and negative. 

Any thoughts? Anything that can help. If this is a flare up atm anything that can help making it burp-free again will try. The only thing that helps and completely stops this is cetirizine. Which is extremly strange.

I am hungry, I eat normal (I dont drink alcohol at all or coffee or smoke) nd eating doesnt cause me any pain. 

i know this is a terrible mess but I am getting so so fed up of it and I always get brushed off and no referal. the bright side is that comparer to 2 years ago I am.better. 

if anyone has ideas zhout I can try bring it up with doctor and maybe get somewhere. ",1,1771273829.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Okay so I 17F am very new at dating and all. A few months ago I came out as bisexual (to my small circle) originally I had been a lesbian but questioning from September-November. This one guy let’s call him Dan 18M from my work asked me to hangout. I thought he meant as friends but eventually when we hung out I realized it was a date. We did go on a few more but I never really wanted any physical contact. I did like hanging out but I wasn’t feeling a romantic connection so I ended it jan 1st.  

While dating, it was slightly awkward. In person when we had shifts together, we weren’t like constantly talking. There would always be awkward silence like it seemed like we had to say something, im usually awesome at comfortable silences. Dan is a very sweet guy, it just felt too awkward to be weird and silly. We liked some of the same music like radiohead, the smiths etc. However we didn’t exactly click.

 We were still friends, we went thrifting and out for coffee after that. I felt more myself, and at work Ive been way more chatty to everyone. I found myself really liking this one guy, ill call him Jack 18M. Jack is very silly and friendly, we usually joke and have made a handshake. Jack is also very artsy, and we just have more chemistry. I have a lot of my friends on snapchat, and i would occasionally text him about work.

Last week I told my work friend, Leah 16F that I kind of thought that I liked Jack. She freaked out and told me she definitely thinks that he likes me. But there is a big thing that conflicts with everything: Jack is one of Dan’s closest friends. Leah told me to just go for it, originally I was going to avoid conflict but she ended up talking to him when they were scheduled. 

Apparently Jack liked me way before Dan, and thought that Leah and I were seeing each other (She once texted me drunk wanting me to come over). And I guess he does like me still, ever since then he has been texting me. It’s been interesting honestly, I feel more able to express myself and I think I do like him romantically. Currently were friends and I’m planning on just staying friends until I know for sure that I do like him. So it’s currently not romantic, were just kind of getting to know eachother.

However… yesterday I saw that Dan had blocked me on snapchat and instagram so I asked Leah. She was scheduled with Dan and asked if Jack had mentioned what was going on with me. And no he did not, so Leah told him everything and he is pretty pissed off. He’s really bothered because he thought after I broke things off,it was because I was gay, which I didn’t say that at all. I asked her what she thinks and she said it kind of was a bad thing to do.  

I’m honestly kind of lost, Jack and I are currently just friends.  Were all coworkers so its not like I seeked out his friend. I was told that its a problem between Dan and Jack to figure out, but I still feel bad. I’m also worried about if Dan is gonna start talking about me to everyone, any advice on what I should do??",1,1771273516.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

So I (F24) am getting married this year in October and my fiancé (M25) and I are in the middle of prepping and planning everything. I’ve made a group chat with all my bridesmaids so it’s easier to plan who does what and when everybody has time. However, one of my bridesmaids, Madison, has pretty much been ghosting me: in the group chat she never or rarely replies and if she does it’s very vacuous. In private I’ve been texting her to see how she’s doing and if she has time to hang out, to which the reply for the last eight months was always “Sry I’m busy, I’ll text you when I have time” and then never reaches out.

Some background info: Madison and I have been studying the same bachelors and master’s degree for 5 years now and have become good friends especially in the last two years of studying. One of my coworkers, Craig, who’s also a friend of mine and who has studied the same master’s degree as us, was briefly dating/seeing Madison (they never made it official). The four of us even went on a double date once, where we’ve talked about early wedding plans. Around May of last year the two broke it off and I was sort of between both sides since I heard both POVs. Shortly after this (\~2months) Madison started dating somebody else (who I haven’t been introduced to).

Recently Madison’s finally admitted that she is not feeling well and again can’t hang out with a lot of people around or in crowded places (I never specified that I wanted to go out, I would have loved just talking to her on the phone or grabbing a coffee like we used to). At work through chatter Craig and I got to talking about Madison and he told me the probable reason why she’s sad/depressed: Apparently her mom has a quite severe cancer relapse and doesn’t want to treat it through chemo or any other means but with herbal drops. Madison (according to Craig) also agrees with this treatment option. Not to get into a ‘what’s the best way to treat cancer’ debate but that fact was very surprising to me, since we all studied in the medical field.

After discovering why Madison wasn’t engaging at all with me, I decided to set up an online meeting with all the bridesmaids. That way nobody has to leave the house or even be on camera. Again, Madison did not participate at all in finding a good time for the online meeting so I texted her privately. I sent her a very long and very caring message. Since she had told me she’s not doing the best, I said that I think it might be best if she wasn’t gonna be a bridesmaid anymore, so she doesn’t have to stress herself even more, but that I would still love her to be at the wedding and that our friendship is important to me. To this she simply replied with a “oh thanks, been wanting to text you about that too. Thanks for being understanding” no apology no ‘we’re still friends’ nothing. Again, in her eyes, I OFFICIALLY DO NOT KNOW that her mom has cancer and from my POV it seems like she’s just ghosting me or slowburn stopping our friendship.

After this message exchange, suddenly she’s posting daily on her IG story from her vacation in a very large and busy city (so much for not wanting crowded places), smiling as if nothing in the world could be wrong. So I replied to one of her stories “good to see you’re having a good time, enjoy your vacation :)” to which she replied very dryly with a “thanks” no emojis no nothing (which is very unlike her). Around the same time, Craig was asking me some timeline questions on their whole situation, because he remembered one of the last exchanges with her: In the summer, they saw each other on public transport and chatted for a bit. He asked her, if she was still in contact with me and if we’re hanging out a lot still. To this she replied with “no, not really anymore”, which would have been news to me at the time, since she texted me minutes later about how awkward it was seeing him again.

All of these things compiled over time have left me feeling pretty shitty, and looking back I always put more into my friendship with Madison than she gave me. I’m getting very mixed signals from her and I know that can happen when a relative is potentially dying, but she never told me any of that and just stopped talking to me altogether now. My feelings on her being my bridesmaid, have shifted from wanting her and her boyfriend at the wedding, to just wanting her at the wedding (since she’s never introduced the guy to me), to now not wanting to invite her at all, since she’s become more of a stranger than a friend.

So reddit would I be the asshole if I uninvited her since she hasn’t been a good friend to me at all for almost a year, even though she’s going through a really tough time?",1,1771273439.0,AITAH,6,0.67,False

I’ve suddenly lost water pressure and coffee is under extracted as a result. I’ve tried:

Removing and replacing the water filter

Descaling x3

Cleaning cycle x3 

Playing with grind sizing just in case

It’s the same person, with the same beans, doing the same routine. I think there must be a genuine fault for the water pressure to be so off? 

Does anyone have any other suggestions before I book a repair?",0,1771273365.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,0.5,False
1r6kri2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6kri2,okay so i need genuine feedback (new story),"im very into existentialist writing and i'm aspiring to write a short story about a dad who is very emotionally conflicted about his newborn girl, and i'm going to delve into heavy themes (this is very unfinished) also ive been crying about how bad this is for like a while now, because im trying a new writing technique of minimalism. the bold and italics are scenes im going to come back to later when im writing hence why its there. I bolded some scenes so i can bring them back into future chapters scenes so it builds repitive behaviours because this guy is so immersed in his routine that he wants to disregard anything that requires emotional effort

've been going to this coffee shop for over two years, and James started working there about a year ago when i was still with my ex. I always thought he was like objectively attractive but it never meant anything to me back then, and even still after my breakup. Over time though we started having small conversations.

He didn't remember my name at first but i could really tell he remembered my face. I was gone for six weeks for winter break (went back home for a few weeks) and when i came back to the coffee shop he said ""welcome back"" which was surprising lol. we had a small conversation and that was that.

the next week though i feel like things changed pretty fast. i sat at these seats that are like right up against the counter, and he remembered my name, asked about what i was studying on, and we had a bunch of pocket conversations throughout the night until close. he teased me about being there ""every day"" lol, he remembered my usual order and made fun of me for it (he said i always order a ""large iced sugary latte""), reccomended me a few coffee shop places in his hometown, and when i told james and the other barista alex that i couldn't afford to get a cup of coffee every day, they helped me hack the menu so i could get coffee for cheaper.

then next week, it like shifted a little bit again. he waved at me when i walked in, reccomended a tea, and we talked about our degrees. a random guy hit on me that day, and james poked fun at me and called it ""smooth"" and i laughed and moved on. then james brought up the guy who hit on me again, told me that the guy was a regular but he'd never seen the guy talk that much, and when i told him that the guy asked for my instagram, james said ""your instagram, not your number? that's so juvenile to me."" we bonded over awkward flirting stories, and i noticed he's attentive. like his coworker interrupted my story and they talked for a few minutes, but james pretty much picked up right where i left off. we teased each other a bit too for random things (i'd recap it all but then this post would be pretty long)

then a few days after that, i ordered coffee and asked about his valentine's day and he asked about mine (long story short we both know that we're both single lol), and he recognized my shirt from this one photo i had showed him a few days ago. i was there with a friend of mine, i introduced them to each other. at some point james asked me if i was going to hang out at the coffee shop that day, i told him no cause me and my friend were just getting coffee and then going hiking. he laughed and was like ""well that sounds more fun than working here rn"" and we just moved on after that (there was a line up building behind me)

that's like a general summary lol i haven't included quite a few minor things but idk. it feels kinda warm and fun and playful and i can't tell if it's like on it's way to flirting but we're both holding back or if i'm delusional and he's just hot and i'm hopelessly crushing on this guy. i mean i hope he likes me, what do yall think?",1,1771273311.0,relationship_advice,5,0.67,False

I do not know any vegans personally, but I do know that a lot of vegans will also not participate in things that contribute to human suffering (fast fashion being the main thing that comes to mind, but also chocolate or coffee). Generally the consensus I've seen is that this is not due to their veganism, but rather a separate vein of activisim they are interested in. What I'm wondering is if it would detract from the movement to include 'humans' as animals within veganism, and if this is a common viewpoint.",3,1771273271.0,AskVegans,15,0.8,False
