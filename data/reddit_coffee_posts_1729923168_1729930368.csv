I was out at locations with friends. Normally I would get absolutely hammered. But I drove with a car and also I want to drink less, if not stop entirely, and yesterday showed me that it would be little to no problem. Yesterday I notice that my mood in an evening is ENTIRELY dependent on the mood of the people around me, my friends and the music and just the overall vibe. One was an outdoor music event and the other was a queer party. It was just amazing that I was able to enjoy dancing and talking to friends i haven‚Äôt seen in a long time and I absolutely did not miss alcohol. I partied and danced til 3 and didn‚Äôt sleep until 4 or something. Yet I got up at 9am this morning and felt wonderful. A bit tired which felt kinda cozy. I‚Äôm drinking coffee, watching a documentary and I‚Äôll walk my dog. If I drank alcohol, I wouldn‚Äôt get up til 11 and I would just sit in the couch and would be sorry for myself and feel bad.

1gcg6xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1gcg6xz/4_months_since_stopping_birth_control_still_no/,4 months since stopping birth control & still no period!!!,"HELP! So me and my partner have decided to start trying to fall pregnant. So 4 months ago I stopped taking my birth control (which I was taking for 1 year and 3 months) I have not yet been blessed with a period. I was regular before taking the pill but only because I was taking inositol (that stuff is magical).

I have been taking Inositol again ever since stopping the pill as I knew previously it worked so well for me, I am also taking NAC, Berberine & swapped my coffee with spearmint tea. But I am really struggling as we really want to start our journey but without ovulation/periods it's been hard.

Is it normal to be going this long without a period?? Has anyone experianced this before? If so please feel free to share your story or any suggestions on what more I can do.

1gcg5n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gcg5n2/aita_for_frequenting_a_local_cafe_where_i_am_not/,AITA for frequenting a local cafe where I am not welcome?,"There is a small local cafe in my neighborhood that is somewhat unordinary in that it functions as a kind of salon. The cafe owner hosts potluck parties, movie nights and birthdays at the cafe.

I've been going to this cafe for over a year, and at first I maintained the usual owner-customer relationship with the owner. Then I developed a crush on him and he seemed to notice. One time I was there alone late at night and the owner asked me out of the blue if I had feelings for him. I said no, and he joked ""please don't like me in that way,"" and I said I wouldn't, and he went ""how can you be so sure?"" which was strange.

After that I tried to keep a distance. About six weeks ago I was there and there was a new customer who was asking if the cafe only opens late at night. I said ""when it opens during the day I'm the only one here"" and the owner seemed miffed about this. So after the new customer left, I apologized.

The next day I woke up to a very, very long text from the owner. He said that what I had said the night before was way over the line. He then mentioned how I would say things like ""I wish it would be just us here"" when the cafe was filled with people I like, saying that that comment also felt to him like something that shouldn't be said. He then said ""if you can't understand or grasp what I am saying, please refrain from using our cafe.""

I sent an equally long apology to this text. I finished the apology by saying ""I will stop frequenting the cafe not because I don't understand what you said but to stop making mistakes that you will find uncomfortable.""

He replied to this with ""what I meant when I said to please refrain from using our cafe if you don't understand wasn't to tell you to stop coming; I knew you would become uncomfortable if I said that so I was making a last gesture of consideration for you. I value you very much as a friend and I like you a lot. feel free to visit again anytime you want.""

This left me confused, so I didn't reply to this last text. Then a week later there was a pre-scheduled potluck party at the cafe, which I didn't plan to go to. But then the day before the owner texted me asking me to come so I went.

I arrived a bit early, and the owner and I had a one-on-one about what we'd discussed before. He said he had nothing he was sorry for, and said ""this isn't gaslighting"" but that ""since you've seen me cut it off with other customers before you must know, but I don't usually explain things in such detail when I cut off people, I was doing you a favor since it's you."" I apologized for everything again and we ended it there.

After the potluck, I didn't visit the cafe for over a month. Yesterday I went for a coffee for the first time in over a month, and the owner was very cold.

I don't know what to make of this whole situation. Why would the owner say all those things, then invite me to the potluck, then say what he said, and then treat me coldly again after I didn't visit for a month? Am I the asshole here?",1,1729929898.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

1gcg0g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OrangeCreamDragon/comments/1gcg0g0/the_end/,The end.,"From the first time I read 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' I have been silently obssessed with the end of side walks. Generally any edge of a thing where things happen and that is the end of where things happen at. The end.

So, here is where I end, will end, had ended. It is all wrapped up in the same place, but this time, there is an end approaching that, while I am actively creating it, and it terrifies me for being such an unknown, I a freed by this sense of endness to a way of living that is limited, unexpressive, devoid of feeling anything wonderful, devoid of living in any meaningful way on a day to day bases. However what I mean by the last one is that nothing feels meaningful except these sort of volitile self destructive acts I undertake on occasion. 

But it is the end to all of that. The night is darkest before the dawn, and just before the sun rises it is the coldest. Dawn is wet in some places and the dampness chills you to the bone, it's aweful. But it can be wonderful if you are prepared. A warm fire and hot coffee and cooking breakfast with warm cozy things turns that wet hell into a dream. Then the sunrises, and all thought of memory of whatever was happening is burned away in the reality of the light from a star. 

And in that this thing that is happening to me, this life that I am sailing, mastering, I missing a sock and my cozy blanket is not big enough to cover all of me, but I warm myself in cozy embrace of the fire waiting for the sunrise. So, it is the end I keep telling myself because this is the worst things have ever been for me, and yet at the same time, I have a peace that I have never felt. I have a careless, worriless presence of mind that I never thought was possible. Even in my dark miserable moments that no one knows about, the true casms of my psyche, I still know this won't last much longer. 

And so I dream of Christmas, because this horror is ending.",1,1729929231.0,u_OrangeCreamDragon,0,0.99,False

It came with 3 baskets, I‚Äôve been mainly using the pressurized one? The one that was already in the portafilter.

Also the little black ‚Äúscrew‚Äù that sits in between the basket and portafilter‚Ä¶does that need to be there or can be done without? Another thing I noticed is one scoop (using the scoop provided by gaggia) is a little too much for the other 2 baskets. My portafilter wouldn‚Äôt attach on until I removed some coffee grounds.

I am also having trouble securing the portafilter on but I‚Äôve read here that it takes time to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù in so I hope it‚Äôll fix with time. 

The lack of space between the tray and portafilter is another issue. I do plan to get a grinder and do the whole setup with a scale and everything so not looking forward to always taking out the tray.

Also having trouble getting my milk to the ‚Äúwet paint‚Äù stage. It‚Äôs been just regular runny milk each time I‚Äôve attempted. But I‚Äôll keep practicing and watching tutorials

But its stuck to the mold,"I made a very thick all epoxy coffee table. But i did not plan it well from the beh inning as this is my first project working m with resin. 

I made the mold out of wood and covered it with sheathing tape but i left some space in the corner I guess and the resin started leaking through it all over the floor and I did all this 5 hours before my flight to go on vacation (i was trying to pour it and leave it so when I get back it would be cured and ready for me to take it off the mold). I cleaned it up as much as i could and thought I clogged all the holes it was leaking from and put some paper towels under it (I know im stupid and I should be playing with resin without supervision lol). And I left it there because I had to go to the airport.

Anyways, I came back to find hardened cured epoxy stuck all over my floor. I‚Äôve broken and sanded and sawed whatever I coule from the top and poured acetone all over it and tried a heat gun but theres a bit that I just cant remove now. I got my resin and poured it in and finished the table now and it didnt leak because of course the previous leak sealed all the holes lol. But now the whole thing is stuck to the wooden mold.  

So my question is 

1. What can I do about my floor? 
2. How can I remove the mold from it? It is pretty thick 2.5 inches deep
And the length and width are 46 x 24 inches

This Keto custard is a revelation in the world of guilt-free desserts. It‚Äôs a velvety, luscious delight that boasts all the creamy goodness you‚Äôd expect from a classic custard, but with a remarkable twist ‚Äì it‚Äôs entirely low in carbs and has no sugar. This means you can savour every spoonful without worrying about derailing your Keto progress.

It‚Äôs a dessert that‚Äôs not only easy to prepare, but also satisfies your sweet cravings while staying firmly within the boundaries of a healthy, low-carb diet. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds, and I can‚Äôt wait to share this delightful recipe with you. So let‚Äôs get into the divine recipe.

|| || |Serves|4 people| |Prep time|15 minutes| |Cook time|1 hour 15 minutes|

# Ingredients

|| || |Eggs|3 large| |Erythritol¬†(You can use monk fruit or Swerve instead)|4 tablespoons| |Vanilla Essence|2 teaspoons| |Heavy Cream|240 grams| |Unsweetened Almond Milk|240 grams| |Nutmeg ground|¬Ω teaspoon|

# Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 150C/300F.
2. Give an 8-inch deep pie dish a good greasing, and then set it aside.
3. In a sizable bowl, combine the eggs and erythritol, then whisk them together for approximately 5 minutes, or until they‚Äôve lightened in colour.
4. Now, toss in the vanilla and pour in half of the heavy cream. Give it a thorough whisking.
5. Pour in the rest of the cream and almond milk, then whisk until everything is nicely blended together.
6. Pour this mixture into the greased pie dish you prepared earlier, and don‚Äôt forget to sprinkle some nutmeg on top for that extra touch of flavour.
7. Put the pie dish inside a big roasting dish. Then, create a water bath by adding hot water to the roasting dish, making sure it goes up to about halfway on the side of the pie dish.
8. Place in the oven and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until it jiggles in the centre.
9. Leave to cool it down for 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm or cold, on its own, or add a little Keto Whipped Cream.

I‚Äôm tired of pretending I don‚Äôt have a horrible father. I always try to make him look good in front of others , he‚Äôs a horrible man. He hit my brother me and my mother. He abused us since forever. He‚Äôs a drunk bastard. 

I thought I loved him as a child because he lived away for 5 years and I used to miss him , he used to get me toys. Didn‚Äôt make up for all the abuse. I‚Äôve seen him hit my own mother with a belt at the age of 5. I‚Äôve seen him slap and kick her. I‚Äôve seen him admit to cheating on my mom and talk about his sexual needs in front of us his own kids , in vulgar ways. She stayed. I always told her to leave and that we didn‚Äôt want him around the house. She never left. 

For 2 years now , my father has been horrible than before. He thinks being diabetic gives him a pass to treat us more horribly. I‚Äôve seen him throw my little brother on walls , hit him with wooden chairs , he hits me too but not as bad. Only kicks me or hits me with his hands but never threw things at me. Mainly because I don‚Äôt do anything. My brother fainted once because of the beating. 

But he makes up for the fact that he doesn‚Äôt beat me up as bad by completely destroying my mental health. I got into a really good school , only smart kids go there. He complains about having to take me to school everyday and calls me names , he also calls me a burden and wishes he never had me although I said it‚Äôs okay if I take transportation. He complains about having to give me lunch money. 4 dollars. Although my father is somewhat rich. We own two cars , 1 house , two apartments and a studio. 

I dream of going to study in a good university, so I study a lot. I take a lot of standardized tests so I can make my chances better , I try to have hobbies and extracurriculars too , I only go out 4 times a year. Each time I go out he makes it hell. Calls me a whore. Whole time I just wanted to see a movie in the mall or to grab coffee with friends. He knows I am diagnosed with bipolar/borderline and ocd , therapists told him I am suicidal yet he refuses to get me my medication or the necessary checkups. He neglects therapy appointments and tells me I should kill myself in any minor argument , he says he wishes I was dead , today I wanted to go to the cinema to watch smile 2 with my friends. He said he hopes I die , kicked me with his leg , and said he‚Äôd kill himself if I watched the movie because cinema is for nasty people. 

These comments make my suicidal ideas worse , if I tried today it would be my 6th attempt this year , im only 18 and I dream of one day working in the UN or UNICEF and helping children , I have the potential. I don‚Äôt want to destroy my own dreams , but I can‚Äôt help the urge to try again. To end my life. I don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore.

I came here to tell my story of loosing my(23M) gf(24F), together for year and a half, because I have a problem.

Yesterday started off as a peaceful day, woke up for work, woke up my gf for work bc shes a heavy sleeper, went and finished the day, came back home. The day was a typical friday day, everyone preparing for the weekend, my gf went to her moms place to chill for a bit and have fun with her animals. 

Around 6pm I went to pick up a gift for my brother, I first picked her up and drove us to a pickup spot, came back and had some McDonalds, I went to work on the laptop and my gf was watching me, she used to love watching me fix something. We had our usualy talks, I went to install Windows on the laptop and was waiting for it, I opened up the Tiktok and just scrolled through the memes, same with Instagram.

We watched it together for a bit and she said she wasnt feeling too good and went to lay, she asked me to join her and to cuddle, eventually I agreed, it took me couple of minutes, we were chilling on the bed cuddles up and watching some Instagram reels, 1 Instagram reel popped up and both of us laughed about it, I asked her if I could send it to my girl bestfriend(21F),background about her and me, we dated for a bit when me and her were 13,14, but it didnt last long and we stayed as friends.

She said no and I said okay, went to scroll more, she got I believe the word is ""triggered"", my gf and I had a talk about her multiple times, she met her aswell and they went on couple coffee dates and were pretty close. We talked about how its triggering for her that GBF and I still keep in contact after dating. We decided to keep the interactions with her to the minimum and my gf told me to not send her ""sexual memes"" and keep barerly any contact with her. My gf and I opened up a DM with her and all I did was send the memes I though were funny and not as much sexual, my gf thought otherwise and we had a fight about it, she asked me why am I still friends with her if we dont talk and only send memes, I replied bc shes my best friend, shes like a sister to me, Ive known her for about 8 years. 

She says its not normal for Us to be friends and we had a fight, I got mad and gave her my phone and said ""do whatever You want, if You wanna block her do that, You can have complete control over my socials"". I continued working on a laptop and she was on my phone, she yelled ""do You think Im dumb"", I said wdym, she opened up my search history and saw I looked up porn. 

Her and me had couple of fights about my porn addiction before, she doesnt like me doing it and every couple of months I get that urge to watch it, no I do not jerk off to it, 10 days ago was the samr thing, I pleaded for her to stay and that I would get help for it, it was all empty words for her and she took some stuff and went to leave, I followed her, I tried to get her to stay but her words ""Youve done this too many times, I forgave u, and u kept breaking my promise, If I stay there wont be any trust from me even after 20 years"". We had conversation outside and it was me pleading for her to stay, but she was firm on her words, she said she would pick up her stuff next week and that would be it. I apologized to her, told her I love her and care for her and left. 

I got home and cried my eyes out until eventually falling asleep, I made a dumb decision of cutting myself aswell bc of the pain I caused her. Im writing this next morning, I feel suicidal and I wanna do more self harm for the pain I caused her, I miss her so much and I keep wishing she would come back but harsh reality is showing me opposite. I never cheated on her with another person or was flirty with anyone besided her. Shes such a great person and Im the one with a big problem, I took her love and trust for granted and shredded it. I hope my story is gonna help anyone who is thinking of making mistakes I made. 

TL;DR dont take people for granted, once they leave you its gonns hurt alot, I made that mistake and I have to live my life without the person I loved and cared for, the onky person who believed in me.",2,1729927997.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

He was recently selected as a model for Kyochon Chicken after the food company Paldo Bibimmyeon II, SPC Baskin Robbins, and Ediya Coffee. As he became a popular actor after the drama ""Lovely Runner"" aired, he is now callin in the retail industry.


In particular, even companies that have been avoiding ""Star marketing,"" such as Ediya Coffee and Kyochon Chicken, are choosing Byun Woo-suk as a model, and Byun Woo-suk's popularity is growing day by day.


Kyochon Chicken recently chose Byun Woo-suk as its brand model for the first time in 9 years, breaking the taboo of not doing star marketing. It is the first time in nine years that the company has used a celebrity model again since it set up actor Lee Min-ho as a model in 2016.


Analysts say that the reason why Kyochon Chicken has adopted a celebrity model again is a strategy to restore brand awareness and achieve a rebound in sales. In order to reverse the decline in sales, sales of Kyochon Chicken, which had remained firmly at the top of the franchise chicken industry, fell behind bhc Chicken.


Ediya Coffee has recently chosen Byun Woo-suk as its new face to transform its image. It is the first time that the company has introduced a star model in its 23 years since its foundation. It is said that the company picked him as a model in line with the good image of Byun and the value of Ediya Coffee, which has been silently pursuing his path for a long time. 


Ediya Coffee also seems to have put Byun Woo-seok at the forefront to improve its image and performance. 

 
Earlier, SPC Baskin Robbins also selected Byun Woo-seok as a new brand model in August. Baskin Robbins is marketing Byun Woo-seok by launching ""Woo-seok Is Alien,"" which Byun Woo-seok participated in the development last month.


In the case of Paldo Bibimmyeon II, which is modeled after Byun Woo-seok, sales exceeded 3 million within two weeks of its release. The number is two copies sold per second. Earlier, Paldo Bibimmyeon II exceeded 1 million sales within five days of its release. The figure is about two weeks earlier than the original sales plan of Paldo, and the ""Byeon Woo-seok effect"" is believed to have been crazy. Thanks to this popularity, Paldo also conducted marketing to produce photo cards of brand model Byun Woo-seok and put them in products that were released.

Anyways, I sit down to chat eventually. We talk talk talk and then she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwe should go and get coffee together‚Äù. I COULD NOT believe. Of course, she didn‚Äôt say it in an explicitly romantic way - but idec because I was starting to think that maybe she didn‚Äôt  like me at all lol.

üé® When a Logo Outgrows Itself!

Picture this: your logo‚Äôs out there, front and center on every product, every screen, waving the brand flag like it‚Äôs got no worries. And then, one day, you‚Äôre staring at it and thinking, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶this doesn‚Äôt look as fresh as it used to!‚Äù I mean, if our smartphones can get upgrades every year, why can‚Äôt a logo? Updating your animated logo is like giving your brand a new wardrobe‚Äîone that‚Äôs more ‚Äòred-carpet‚Äô and less ‚Äòthrowback Thursday.‚Äô

üöÄ Logos and the Space Race (Kind Of)

Remember when space travel seemed impossible? And now look at us‚Äîwe‚Äôve got billionaire joyrides orbiting Earth! Logo animation is kind of like that. It‚Äôs launched into the world, packed with promise, but eventually, it needs a reboost. Just because your logo‚Äôs in orbit doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt get an upgrade! Think of it as strapping in for a new mission, adding some turbo to the visuals so it can outshine every other ‚Äústar‚Äù in the marketing universe.

üìÖ But My Logo‚Äôs Not THAT Old...Is It?

You ever have that friend who‚Äôs in total denial about needing a haircut? That‚Äôs what some brands are like with logos. If your logo hasn‚Äôt evolved in years, it might be time for a reality check. Styles change, colors trend, and animation techniques leap forward faster than the latest TikTok dance craze! Give your logo the glow-up it deserves‚Äîbecause ‚Äúvintage‚Äù should stay in the thrift stores, not on your homepage.

It‚Äôs like that friend who can rock any haircut and still be totally recognizable‚Äîgive your logo that adaptability.

üìà Update? Yes. Reinvent the Wheel? Not Necessarily

Think of your logo update like a performance tune-up, not a full car overhaul. Sure, your animated logo can stay familiar, but with a fresher edge. Just a hint of something different, enough to make people go, ‚ÄúWhoa! They‚Äôve been busy.‚Äù The goal isn‚Äôt to make your audience forget your brand but to keep them hooked.

# What is quota system or affirmative action?

Affirmative action, or quotas, aims to uplift and represent¬†**disadvantaged groups**¬†by reserving seats in education, politics, and jobs. All provinces in Pakistan have quotas for jobs; quotas for Sindh are just divided into 60% rural and 40% urban, where Urban Sindh includes only the urban parts of Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur, rest of Sindh is considered Rural Sindh.

This concept of reserved seats is used all over the world. Famous scholarships like Rhodes, Erasmus Mundus, and many others have reserved seats for each country. This is meant to uplift and represent all countries, otherwise these scholarships will only be availed by Americans from Ivy league colleges. The European Union and many countries like Canada, the USA, and South Africa implement quotas to represent indigenous people, minorities, and/or women in education, politics, leadership, and public and private sector jobs. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action).

# Why not just hire purely on merit?

Most people who ask this question are privileged to have good education, financial status, and standard of living. These people didn't have to travel 5 kilometers to study at a subpar government school. After all this privilege, they want ""fairness"" so that they can compete ""fairly"" with someone from Tharparker who had to work at a brick kiln after school. Quotas not only help uplift these people; they represent them in government jobs. Why does American policing show such racial bias against Black people? Because it‚Äôs dominated by white officers, creating an imbalance that perpetuates systemic racism.

# Who started this quota system?

In March 1929, Muhammad Ali Jinnah demanded reserved seats for Muslims in legislative bodies and all other government services in his famous Fourteen Points:

>Provision should be made in the Constitution giving Muslims an adequate share along with the other Indians in all the services of the State and in local self-governing bodies, having due regard to the requirements of efficiency.

Jinnah understood that Muslims were generally at a disadvantage compared to non-Muslims regarding their representation in government positions and legislative bodies. Shouldn't Jinnah have asked for pure merit instead of reserving a share for Muslims? Once again, I will let you answer this.

After independence, **Liaquat Ali Khan introduced a quota system in 1948**. In this quota system, government positions were allocated using the following quotas:

|Groups|Percentage of population|Share in Quota (Percent|
|:-|:-|:-|
|East Bengal|**56.75**|**42**|
|West Punjab|**28**|**24**|
|Sindh,¬†Balochistan,¬†NWFP,¬†Khairpur|**14.05**|**17**|
|Muhajirs|9.8% ([1951 Census](https://repository.lahoreschool.edu.pk/xmlui/handle/123456789/14514))|15|
|Karachi|1.2|2|

^(Source:) [^(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quota\_system\_in\_Pakistan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quota_system_in_Pakistan) ^((Wikipedia table has the sources.))  
Note that Karachi's population at the time was mostly Muhajirs. Not only did Karachi get its own quota, but Muhajirs also got a separate special quota that wasn't available to any other ethnicity. Their first language was imposed as the only official language. Before 1974, British had been using Sindhi as the official language in government, courts, and other government bodies. **Not only did Liaquat Ali Khan and Co. impose their own language on Sindh, barring anyone who didn't know Urdu from entering bureaucracy, they reserved huge quotas for Muhajirs, who were primarily living in urban centers of Sindh with easy access to education and non-government employment.**

This was only changed by Yahya Khan in 1970 when his government divided Sindh's quota into Urban and Rural. Until this, Rural Sindh was systematically barred from entering government. **Contrary to MQM's online claims, PPP did not introduce the quota system in Pakistan.** PPP only codified and extended the existing system in the constitution.

# The unjust quota system in universities of Karachi that MQM and JI don't talk about:

Under the KSP (Karachi, Sindh, and Pakistan) policy, government universities in Karachi give first priority to students who have completed their education in Karachi. I will give you a data-based example from NED, one of the best public universities in Sindh. NED has a seats quota for candidates based on their intermediate board. Students of the Karachi Board always get the highest number of seats. Following is the breakdown of students passing intermediate vs. the number of seats allocated at NED University:

|Board|Passed Intermediate|NED Seats Quota|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BISE Karachi - Pre-Eng|12,233|1415|
|BISE Karachi - Pre-Med|13,832|93|
|BISE Hyderabad|9,751 (Pre-eng)  28,968 (Pre-med)|33|
|BISE Sukkur|11,049 (Pre-eng)  26,657 (Pre-med)|28|
|BISE Mirpurkhas|16,969 (Combined)|40|
|BISE Larkana|9,492 (Pre-eng) - 24,320 (Pre-med)|28|

This means someone who studied in rural Tharparker in a subpar government school cannot get admission into NED **even if they get more marks in the entry test than a student from Karachi**. Quotas are meant to uplift disadvantaged groups, but in Karachi,¬†***ganga ulti behti hai***\*.\*¬†Students living in the mega-city of Pakistan, with access to the best schools in Pakistan, have a quota reserved for them.¬†**This is not just limited to NED; all government universities like the University of Karachi, DOW, etc., follow the KSP policy.**

**The quota system in government jobs only limits employment in government jobs, which is just a minuscule fraction of overall employment in Pakistan, and it represents the population of Urban and Rural Sindh. The quota system in government universities of Karachi limits access to all employment opportunities and is unimaginably biased in admitting Karachi-based students.** Why aren't JI and MQM leadership talking against the quota system in universities of Karachi if they care so much about ""fairness""? Do they or anyone support [Sindhi students who protest against this quota?](https://pakobserver.net/students-protest-against-ksp-admission-policy-in-ku/)

**TL;DR:**¬†MQM and JI are basically hypocrites who talk against the current quota system without discussing its history‚Äîhow it was introduced by Liaquat Ali Khan to benefit an already privileged group like Muhajirs‚Äîor its necessity in its current form to uplift and represent disadvantaged groups. Nor do they complain about the current quota in the government universities of Karachi, which keeps out rural Sindh students and benefits students from Karachi, even though Karachi students already have the best education options.",2,1729926092.0,Sindh,0,1.0,False

1gcf4g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1gcf4g6/about_my_catechumenate_as_a_woman/,About my catechumenate as a woman,"Hi everyone!

I decided to leave a brief account of my experience at the church. I've been reading this sub for years and only TODAY did I reach the conclusion and manage to give a legally appropriate name to the experience I went through in the church. In fact, as we have a very devout Orthodox priest among us who reads us, I decided it would be interesting to write a story like mine. Before that, I need to say that this was just one of the bad experiences I went through at church. Just as it took me years to enter the church, it took me years to accept everything and leave it.



Many years ago, I decided to convert after some time studying and visiting the church. On the recommendation of others, I sought contact with a highly respected Orthodox priest. At first he welcomed me, but then I was simply forgotten. I have not been able to start the catechumenate and have any help with it in a continuous 2 year period. After these 2 years, I decided to give up on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconverting, because it cost me a lot of money to travel to the parish town and it would cost me a lot personally as well. After another 2 years of this period of withdrawal, I came into contact with an Orthodox layman who wanted to be a seminarian. He was quite a proselytizer. For several reasons and because he was mentored by that very respected priest I mentioned earlier, I decided to give this guy a vote of confidence. A few months passed and he invited me to his parish. As he had also invited me to have a coffee outside the church, which surprised me, I decided not to respond to this guy again.

A few more months passed and I found myself in a huge existential crisis. I had anxiety and depression and had been struggling with it for years! I had insomnia and difficulty sleeping, which made me take anxiolytics when I stayed awake for more than 24 hours without being able to sleep well. Ok, talking to a Catholic friend, I decided to give formal religion a chance once again and was willing to start over from scratch: I considered the possibility of going to the Catholic church or the Orthodox church, and then I started studying both to make a decision about that. After a while in this phase, I concluded that my path would be the Orthodox church.

In the meantime, that proselytizing Orthodox guy invited me again to go to his parish and I went. I took all possible precautions and went to this church. As I said before, I had already had a period in which I attended the Orthodox church as curious and interested in converting to the church, so I knew the liturgy and everything about Orthodoxy (I thought I knew everything). Arriving at the parish, I felt that this was my place, that this was my path, that the answer to my problems was there. I thought it was a sign from God that I went there. I thought it was the path I needed to achieve my long-awaited mental stability. I thought that, by managing to have a regulated and meaningful religious life, I would be able to organize all other aspects of my life, including mental health. Ok, it was a very good experience and I spoke with the priest of that parish. I left there deciding that I would do the catechumenate and I did so immediately. For this, I had the help of that proselytizing Orthodox guy. He positioned himself as a kind of intermediary between people interested in the church and the church. He was willing to talk for hours about the Orthodox faith. How he wanted to be a seminarian, he wanted to demonstrate to his superiors that he was a good candidate for the seminary, that is, that he could bring new believers to the church and be useful in giving guidance on orthodox theology to catechumens. The priest authorized him to do this.

Ok, a few months passed and my baptism was soon scheduled. If it were today, I wouldn't have accepted being baptized so quickly (in less than 4 months), because 1. I wasn't mentally stable and 2. many interpersonal conflicts with other Orthodox were emerging. The proselytizing Orthodox guy in the meantime began to put a lot of pressure on me to be baptized quickly. One day, when I expressed doubts about whether I wanted to be baptized at that moment (the baptism date was close), he got angry with me and said that I couldn't make him feel ashamed in front of his priest, who had already set the date for the baptism. I felt cornered, but, as I wanted to convert, I accepted that situation. Conversion for me was my hyperfocus at that moment. It was as if my life depended on that moment, after all, I felt that I needed to order my life based on my conversion.

Ok, at this stage when I was preparing for my baptism, this proselytizing Orthodox guy and candidate for the seminary decided to show romantic interest in me. I still remember how incredulous I was about that. He just decided to say he liked me and started talking about plans about the two of us as a couple. I still remember hearing him commenting to myself about physical details that I had that he liked or disliked (even mocked). Ah, just before his declaration of interest in me, I saw him a few times looking at my body and especially my breasts (yes, it's disgusting). I was very uncomfortable with the whole situation, but I had no one but him to help me in the conversion process. The priest had said he would only speak to me after I was baptized, which made me depend on this proselytizing Orthodox guy (I later confirmed this information with the priest himself and he actually said that). Ok, my first reaction was to make every possible excuse for this guy NOT to have a romantic interest in me. I always disagreed or talked about this subject as a friend, always making it clear that I had no interest, that it was not reciprocated. I simply couldn't cut contact, because I needed to convert, get baptized. One day, maybe 2 weeks before my baptism, I felt really bad about several things and I took an anxiolytic to sleep on a few days in that week (I always took 1 dose before bed every night). This medicine has the side effect of amnesia moments before and after the medicine takes effect. Ok, during this critical week, as always, I was chatting online with this guy, who was responsible for guiding me in my catechumenate (again, the priest and everyone knew that, they knew that he played the role of catechist). I even asked him if I should know any more theological topics before my baptism (he forgot to teach me several important things, by the way). Until one day he told me that I told him I loved him. He told me that I had declared myself to him. When he told me this, I simply didn't remember anything, absolutely NOTHING. He knew that I was taking anxiolytics to sleep and that I was in bad health. When he told me that, I vehemently denied it and he continued to tell me that I had said I loved him. Look, I liked another guy at the time, so I knew there was no chance of me saying something like that to this guy. Despite this situation, I continued contact with him and always answered my doubts about Orthodoxy. I told friends outside the church about the situation and they helped me discern what was going on. If it weren't for these ""worldly"" friends, I wouldn't be able to discern what was happening to me in relation to this proselytizing Orthodox guy.

Ok, the date of my baptism arrived and, on the same day, this proselytizing Orthodox guy asked me to accept our supposed relationship. When he told me that, I didn't understand and I thought he was just joking. This was HOURS before my baptism. I insisted that I didn't want anything and that I just wanted to be baptized. Ok, I got baptized and on the same day I had the lucidity necessary to put an end to this guy who was so insistent on having a relationship with me. I talked to an Orthodox friend about it and that's why I was able to understand that I didn't need to accept that situation.

A few days later, I don't remember exactly, someone from the church came to tell me that this proselytizing Orthodox guy had told several people at the church that we were in a romantic relationship, including, already making plans about whether I could work outside the home or not, how many children we would have (he was the type who only accepted that his wife stayed at home). Like, WTH?? So, when I found out about this, I was very angry and blocked him in every way possible. I took the case to his superior and was told they were going to do something about it. After all this mess, I discovered more things he did and said about me and other women, which made me more indignant. This all occurred within a few months before and after my baptism. Other things happened and I moved away from him completely. However, nothing effective was done against him and I even discovered that I was defamed by him (because I decided to report his behavior). Never again could my church experience be normal. It took me YEARS to understand this whole situation and forgive myself for being SO naive. I just wanted to get baptized and have a religious life in peace.

I don't need to say that all this got worse and affected me mentally for years, right?



Well, I can't give any more details as I feel like I could be recognized. I'm just going to say this guy is in the clergy... Yeah... Nothing was done.



And, of course, the legal name for what I experienced is sexual harassment. This guy took advantage of the position he had (albeit informal) to get closer, manipulate and force a romantic relationship with me. I wasn't the only girl to experience this, there were others, and that's all I'm going to say.

Orthodoxy hates women and objectifies them in different ways. The Orthodox church is made by men and for men. They say they respect the Theotokos, but they are not capable of respecting the women of their own church. The Orthodox church environment is toxic, dangerous and inhospitable to women. If something happens to you, you will not be heard and welcomed. I've seen priests justify sexual harassment by monks against women, so don't expect anything more than that. We are not seen, we have no voice.



Finally, I will never forget my priest's reaction to all of this, his neglect and indifference.

Feedback/Suggestion post. ,"Personal Thoughts of game Currently : The dev team should work on fixing the tutorial a bit more as an optional ask if we want to repeat/ignore tutorial as a optional for newer characters who already had the introduction. The other thing I noticed is bosses mechanics and phases need more work or at least more fleshed out. Did one playthrough and legit felt too overly powered specially with the wish machine being a factor boosting to progression. (very exploitive). Kinda a hard ask but its coming from a good place mind you. That's being a user/player who have played other games and making a decent comparing to give said feedback. 



Potential suggestions. More crafting items (Weapons , Gadgets , Chemical agents , more crafting stations ( maybe a Cybernetic's / Roboticist lab/ Meta R n D: Enhances your base stats further or enhances your mods further. ) , Chemical warfare? Cybernetic enhancements or meta like Enhancements ? Prototype weaponry: Themed per season a legendary item/items that gave out unique buffs that can't be obtained by wish or random drop but be completed by a story progress (somewhere almost end of season or a world boss drop. up to the dev team on this.) silo/dungeon mission maps needs to be bigger and more creative some of it felt too repetitive. more raid bosses/world bosses added. i liked in the mockup trailer that you saw some of the great ones roaming around the map. back when that was present. more deviant ability's that are more profound and designed (don't rush this and if you need concept idea's ask the community for suggestions.) 



Winter Season Item suggestions both for frost and heat concepted 



Drinks for frost: Coffee beans/Coffee grounds to make many variants of coffee drinks. 

Alcoholic drinks for frost: Warmed  Whiskey in a Canteen bottle

Food for Frost: (Japanese) Ramen ,Hotpot dishes Japanese or Korean based style, Takoyaki (from deep sea fishing) , Tonkasu pork with rice (add rice as a growable source of food if not added) , Hot Indian style curry or Japanese (both work just as great make sure recipe adds saffron for the dish and spikemato), (Mexican or Spanish dish) Empanada . Burrito, tacos, Salsa n chips. (American dishes) Spicy BBQ Pork Ribs , Pulled Pork, Bear stew (Authentic old western traditional dish for trappers in the mountains), Hard tac (old fashioned preserved bread) , Clam Chowder (British and American version) , Surf n Turf (lobster and steak).



Drinks to cool you off from the heat: Mojito (has mint n drink) could also add lemon's and limes to the game.  (optional: Lemongrass gin fizz with mint, Mango and mint-spiked lemonade , The Kentucky tea cocktail, )

Food to cool you off during a heatwave: Mint Flavored Ice cream (fits well with the prior mats also can add in heavy cream as a craft able material to milk also for whipped cream.),  ice melon dish (a.k.a Watermelon) Salad's of any type. Spring Rolls, beetroot soup, pasta salads, 



pretty much it but I hope this helps a bit and give some bright idea's for the dev team so far the game is decent but honestly put it def needs more polishing and designing a bit more to be proud of. you still got several other games that can sorta beat this if you are counting remnant series and many more.

It‚Äôs either the same handful of types that show up, or you get stuck in this endless loop of dead-end conversations. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I‚Äôve had the exact same conversation: ‚ÄúHey, how‚Äôs your day?‚Äù followed by a bunch of lukewarm small talk until one of us just stops replying.

Then there are the ones who are clearly looking for some fantasy ideal and treat real people like disposable options.

When we met, I was in my first year of law school and he was a barista planning on going into nursing school. I really have come to love him, but I feel like I‚Äôm kind of dating a different person entirely. 
He likes being a barista, but told me early on that he was burnt out and wants to try nursing school. He didn‚Äôt take any steps towards that so I asked him how I could help. He said I could research some stuff about local programs and discuss it with him. I did. Well, about a month and a half ago, he tells me he received an offer for a shift lead position at the coffee shop and said if he took it, he‚Äôs worried he‚Äôd like it too much and not go to nursing school. He accepted it and has been subtly hinting at not going, and said that he‚Äôs ‚Äújust felt pressured to go to nursing school,‚Äù though not necessarily by me. His promotion has come with shifts extended by an hour, but I only have so much free time and when he gets off at 8, I can only spend so much time before I have to get ready for school/work the next day. When he has an early morning shift, he can‚Äôt do anything the night before. But when he doesn‚Äôt have an early morning shift, he wants to stay up late and I can‚Äôt do that. 
Additionally, when we began dating, he didn‚Äôt vape. But I was away for the first few months for a clerkship (we would see each other about every 3 weeks), and on a visit around 3 months in, I found a vape. It caught me off guard and so I asked. He explained it‚Äôs an old habit that he picked back up and he wants to quit. I kind of shrugged it off because I hadn‚Äôt known him to vape and figured it was a one time thing. I was wrong. We are into month 6 and I‚Äôve expressed that it bothers me, but he hasn‚Äôt stopped. He says he wants to and that this is his last, and all statements of the like. But he still uses it, just secretly. I can taste it when we kiss. It just really frustrates me, and ive realized it‚Äôs a non-negotiable. 

I love him and don‚Äôt want to see this relationship end, at least permanently, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like so much has changed in his vision(s) that I don‚Äôt know if we are aligned anymore. 
Do I proceed by breaking up or asking for some time? Or do I just roll with all of this? Really, any and all advice is appreciated. I don‚Äôt ever want to be the partner that is controlling or anything, but I also have to enforce boundaries that I have. ",1,1729923744.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I hate apps but work from home and since Covid have had trouble meeting people in organic ways. Never married and have no kids. Looking to finally adopt a new dog after 4 years of intense mourning. My first career was a 10 year gruel in local television and am trying to figure out what my second one will be. Currently studying non-profit management in my spare time.

Looking for a leftish dude that's somewhat into music or art etc. If you look like a washed up 90's musician that's great too. I like movies/coffee shops/live music. Most of my 20's and 30's pre Covid I spent seeing local indie shows (raves when I was younger) and reviewing local community theatre. I really love Madonna and The Prodigy as well as drum n bass, happy hardcore, 90's dance music, indiepop, early 00's era sXe Hardcore/Emocore, crappy radio rock, cancon, indie/folk, acoustic singer songwriter stuff, dreampop etc and generally smaller shows and would never expect to drag a man to a stadium concert to see say Lady Gaga (I'll go on my own or with a gay friend unless you really want to go lol) and looking to see how the West end has changed after a decade in the East end as well. Would like to find a boyfriend eventually and definitely not looking for hookups. Coffee dates/Patios (while still warm) possible/Shows/Movies with a drink before are a good Winter date idea for me. I'm not too hung up on politics in terms of romance but you really do have to support Gaza at this point.

My last LTR was pre Covid and I also lost a good best friend who was my concert/activity buddy who passed away during that time so looking for activity partners who open to sharing interests. I've dated a bit causally post Covid but had somewhat of a negative experience with someone who didn't feel it was appropriate to take their partner to shows....which was really disappointing to be honest.

Concerts I've seen so far this year and still plan to see so you get an idea of my taste: Madonna, JJ Wilde x2, Glorious Sons, Julia Holter, (missed Cat Power because I was sick but that was a big one I wanted to see), Fightmaster, Caribou, Crumb, Discovery Zone, Katie McBride, Ginger Root?! some Wavelength shows/Project Nowhere. Coming up is Godspeed, Bibi Club, Nouvelle Vague and Refused. Oasis is obviously happening and will be my third time. I also really like hanging out at smaller places like Baby B etc and would like to check out more places like that.

Always trying to figure out whether to get a synth and learn to play it or take the easy way out and learn how to play guitar. I tried Sitar classes and failed huge.

  
I guess since it matters I'm thin (ish), very white, and about 5'7 and dress like a slob half time time and then pretty fashionable if need be.",2,1729923302.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

The issues started when I went into labour, l was full term, 40 weeks 5 days with a big baby 9lb 7oz and the labour was AWFUL, it started at around 2 in the morning, I woke With pain it was manageable but very uncomfortable, I wasn‚Äôt at the point of needing to go to the hospital as in the uk you have to be at least 4cm dilated before they admit you and my contractions weren‚Äôt close enough or long enough, Shawn refused to get out of bed to support me, stating that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not proper labour yet and I need my sleep ready for when it is‚Äù. I went downstairs and things quickly progressed, now I was in absolute agony and trying to shout up to him to come downstairs, finally at around 7.30am (5 and a half hours after it started) he came downstairs, we made our way to the hospital and I was in active labour for 10 hours, Shawn was in and out of the room, going to get himself coffee or food, or going to make a phone call, he left the room probably 10 times, (once an hour for around 20 minutes each time) every time a different excuse. The worst part comes next‚Ä¶. I delivered my beautiful baby boy, luckily Sean was in the room, I tore pretty badly and needed stitches, Shawn said to the male dr who was stitching me up ‚Äúdo you think you could add a couple more stitches for me mate‚Äù, clearly expecting a laugh but the room fell silent. The Dr then said ‚Äúthat could cause lots of issues for the patient so no absolutely not‚Äù and Shawn remained silent. I was mortified, embarrassed, angry and so so upset because Shawn knows that for me (I have a history of SA) having a male dr down there would be a very scary triggering experience for me and instead of consoling me he made the situation so so much worse. I‚Äôve told him that in future if we have more children I don‚Äôt want him present and I want my mum instead he is upset and has apologised saying it was nerves making him act that way but I can‚Äôt get over how let down I feel AITAH",75,1729923300.0,AITAH,71,0.93,False
