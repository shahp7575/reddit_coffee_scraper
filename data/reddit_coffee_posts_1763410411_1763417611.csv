1ozu4e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1ozu4e9/what_makes_someone_irritating/,What makes someone irritating?,"We've employed a young modern apprentice at work. He's nice enough: polite, helpful, but profoundly irritating. I thought this was just me, but having spoken to colleagues, one has described him as annoying, and another as a nuisance. I cannot pinpoint exactly what it is.

I have made a conscious effort to be accepting and kind to him, I bought him coffee before picking him up and giving him a lift last week, but within minutes I could feel myself getting irritated. Another colleague will not offer him a lift at all - what I'm trying to emphasise is that it's not just a personality clash, but at least three other people at work experience the same thing. 

It's actually got to the point where I'm dreading shifts with him because I know he's going to piss me off, despite me trying desperately to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

Have you ever came across someone like this? Can you articulate what made them irritating? 

  
Here are a couple of trivial things he done tonight that annoyed me:-

\- We coach young children football. He stood and spoke to parents as if he was highly familiar with them, despite not really knowing them. I like that he's confident but the over familiarity was annoying, and I think perhaps it wasn't his role at the time. 

\- To kick-off that matches, we like to ask trivia questions (for example, 'Who are Scotland playing tomorrow night' - first to answer wins. His trivia question was 'what's my name?'. 

I realise again that there isn't a way to articulate it, it's just his personality. I would like to reiterate that I think he's a nice person, but I've never met someone that can really grind people's gears so much.

I requested records at time of purchase, and the seller of my half had nothing to offer, just the standard bylaws. The other owner bought in when it was built and has zero interest in participating in anything remotely like a strata council.

I don't even have high glucose (fasting is ususlly around 80) or insulin (6) 9r A1C (5.1) so I don't think I should be avoiding them as much as I have.

I’m looking to meet someone I can genuinely spend time with whether that’s going for long walks, grabbing a coffee, enjoying a nice dinner, or just having a good conversation. I’m taking things slow and seeing where the connection naturally leads.

Portland:

Edward jolted awake when the wheels of the plane touched down. The other two men didn't look much more awake and aware than he was himself. They filed out of the aircraft and crossed the open lot, ducking into the back of larger car. This one carried them to the Bureau's local Field Office where they were given another space. The man with the prosthetic leg hurried to the room where the materials he would need were stored. He grabbed the small, red book and candles, along with a small bronze bowl and pewter chalice.

It took him a few more minutes to gather the other things, including an old, analog compass, and after a few hours of ensuring that he had memorized the incantation and could properly enunciate each and every syllable. One mistake could easily blow up in his face. He did the ritual in his office, cutting the palm of his hand with a small knife. He let his blood drip on the compass as he finished speaking, and there was momentary flare of the flames of the candles. He raised the compass and the needle spun for a moment before sitting still.

He started toward the parking garage, signing out a vehicle, locating the keys with the proper number on the tag, carrying those to the appropriate parking spot. He slipped behind the wheel and placed the compass in the cup holder so he could glance down at it. Imagine his surprise when the thing led him to the hotel he had booked for the team. He pulled into the parking lot and found an unoccupied space, claiming his cane as he exited the sedan. He leaned on that as he made his way into the lobby, passing by the reception desk without stopping.

To his surprise, the needle didn't direct him to the elevators, instead leading him toward the bar. He saw Anthony and the man he had been following sitting at the bar together. Some of his anxiety withered. At least the blonde individual hadn't gone completely rogue as he had feared. He took a moment to text Andy, letting him know that Michael had been located. He moved into the bar without waiting for the reply. Michael looked up at him as soon as he'd crossed the threshold and stood, extending his hand.

“I do apologize for leaving without telling you.” the angel told him as they shook hands.



“You should be.” his reply came out deadpan and Edward released his grip quickly.

“I had a feeling I was needed.” Michael defended himself.

“He might be right. Something big is happening.” Anthony interjected, thrusting the book he drew in toward his superior.

Ed glanced down at the picture that the younger man had been working on and his eyes widened. Twisted, broken bodies, rendered in charcoal flames and black and white gore and viscera. Demonic shapes cavorting in the flames. Arcane symbols hidden in the curvature of the lines. He felt as if he'd been punched in the gut. He had no idea what it all meant, of course, but he knew that it couldn't be good if the psychic was seeing it. He let out a long, slow breath, and after a moment of thought he cleared his throat.

“Do you have any idea what exactly is going on around here?” he asked, unable to formulate anything else to say.

“We have some ideas, and one of them goes back to our missing person. I assume you read the report that Fiona sent?” Anthony asked.

“I haven't yet. It probably came in while I was in the air.” he mumbled, then raised his eyes to the angel. “We are set up here in the local field office. Join us there when you are done here.” he ordered.

“I will be along... Shortly...” his words trailed off as the entire building seemed to freeze, all of the heads turning toward a new arrival.

It wasn't every day that a woman with wings walked in the door.

On The Road To Crater Lake:

It was hard to focus on the road when two demons were getting intimate in the back seat, but Hunter kept her hands on the wheel and her eyes straight ahead on the road, glad that there wasn't much traffic at this time of night. The two in the back of the vehicle eventually finished up and went still, which made her job much easier. Her friend was asleep in the seat next to her. She sighed and turned the radio up just a little more. When Falielle spoke, she nearly swerved off of the road.

“Pull over at the next chance you get.” he said.

“Of course.” she replied, rolling down the window as the pair of creatures in back lit cigarettes.

She was really starting to regret what she and the other woman had done. At first things had seemed fun, until the demands became more and more extreme, culminating in the first murder. That had been a year before they had killed the homeless man. It had gotten easier, but that fact didn't make her feel the rush that it had before. She was beginning to understand exactly where they stood in the entities grand plan. They were nothing but pawns. A means to an end. She sighed to herself and was almost relieved when she saw the sign informing her that she was approaching a truck stop.

They needed gas, anyway. She was glad for the moments that she got alone when she walked inside and paid cash at the register. She also grabbed herself a burrito from the hot food case and a drink. She returned to the car and almost screamed in frustration when she realized that her two unearthly passengers were no longer sitting in the back seat. Brooke seemed to be waking up, however, which provided her a little silver lining. Her friend stepped out, and walked toward the store. She followed. They smoked, sitting at one of the small picnic tables outside of the store.

“I think we messed up.” Hunter hissed after a long moment of silence.

“What gave you the first clue, when he beat our faces in, or when he raised that bitch?” Hunter spat back, her voice dangerously close to a shout.

She had a point. The bruises on both of them were still fresh, but in her mind, she was grateful that he hadn't done worse. Her train of thought and their conversation disrupted when the man and woman's bodies reappeared around the corner and approached the car. The two human women switched places, with Brooke taking the wheel so that the other of them could close her eyes. It didn't take her long to fall asleep.

They were on the road for more than another hour, though Brooke definitely got the short end of the stick, having to drive the narrow, country roads instead of the well lit highway. They reached the cabin that she had reserved for them, and her friend zombie-walked her way to her bunk. The demons similarly sequestered themselves, and for the first time that week, she was alone. Alone with her aches and pains, and with her thoughts. Regret started to set in as she slumped into the sofa and cracked the bottle of tequila and orange juice.

She mixed herself a drink and gave it a long swallow. The alcohol stung its way down her throat, but she didn't stop drinking until those negative feelings were washed away. She didn't even mind listening to the two monsters in the other room when their pounding and screaming started up again. She poured a third drink, and was halfway through when the commotion paused and the door cracked.

“Would you like to join us?” the smoky, sibilant female voice slithered into her ear.

The woman was powerless to resist.

Back In Portland:

Edward sighed, leaning back in the borrowed office chair. They had slept for a few hours, but by the time they had finished their first meal break, they had figured out where they needed to be. The team were packing and preparing to head out. A car with the license plate had registered at a cabin. It would take them less than an hour to get there if they took the plane. The pair of angels would follow, using the cover of the clouds to avoid having to erase the memories of an entire state. It had been hard enough to do that for the witnesses the night before.

He would stay behind with the two other agents he had brought with him. He felt a pang of frustration at that. He had never wanted to be a higher up. Even after the injury he had carried out his normal duties. He had handled several more mundane cases, as a matter of fact, including the apprehension of a serial killer. He was still capable, and that was what bothered him about the new position he had been put in. The man let out a long sigh, and forced himself to think of anything else besides being shelved against his will.

The headaches had stopped, which gave him a silver lining to latch onto. He also had to be optimistic about the possibility that the team would be successful in their mission. They had made it this far without much in the way of formal training, and though they functioned less like a team and more a collective of individuals, he wasn't going to try and fix something that wasn't broken. Edward lifted the mug of coffee to his lips and took a long sip of his coffee. He was anxious, unable to stay still, and the caffeine in his system didn't help that.

He stood up and began to pace the halls without the cane, avoiding the other agents who worked out of the four story building as much as he could. He returned to the office after a while, checking both of his e-mails, only to find them empty. Edward closed the lid of the small computer, and walked back to the break room. Andy was standing next to the coffee machine, waiting for it to fill the small cardboard cup. He leaned against the back of a nearby chair to keep himself upright.

“How are you holding up?” the other agent asked with a weary smile.

“Doing fine. A little jittery, how are you?” he replied.

“Getting there.” Andy said with a little laugh, extracting the cup from the machine.

His superior placed his own below the nozzle, letting the freshly brewed bean water drip down into the ceramic mug. He rolled his shoulders, and sighed.

“Are you ready to roll out?” he breathed.

“I think so, though I don't know what help myself and Estevez will be.” the other man told him quietly.

“I'm sure you will fond a way to be useful.” Edward assured him.

He retrieved his cup and walked back to the office. He had barely taken a few sips before Shayla entered the room, placing her backpack on the floor, setting the other small bag she was carrying next to that. The others appeared moments later, and they all filed from the room together. Michael and Adeline were already on the roof.

As soon as the car carrying the humans pulled away, they took wing, circling when they stopped to load into their plane.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Hours Later, At The Cabin:

Falielle walked out of the room, followed by the demon in the woman's body.

“It's time to go.” he told the two women sitting on the couch.

They didn't bother to resist. Brooke's body was sore, and the wounds that the pair had inflicted on her still tender beneath the bandages. They all loaded into the car and started back toward the highway. It was when they reached that main road that they turned toward Crater Lake. Imagine the surprise the witch felt when the engine stopped responding to the throttle, the car stopping cold a moment later as if the brakes had locked up. A moment after, the lights died. That's when they heard the chanting. It wasn't Latin.

Fiona and the other pair of Pagans stepped out of the treeline, and Brooke and hunter stepped out to meet them.

“Who are you?” Hunter shouted, more of a demand than a greeting.

“The people who have come to stop you from doing the world in.” Cameron called back.

She scoffed, having used the banter as an opportunity to draw her ritual blade, slicing her palm and muttering under her breath. A wave of force rushed away fom her, strong enough to knock the other three magic users from their feet. That's when the sound of thunderous wings seemed to reverberate through the very fabric of reality. The two angels landed between the trio and the two other witches. Falielle's eyes widened and he reached for the door handle. He straightened and drew in an unnecessary breath.

“You have no dominion here.” he addressed the divine newcomers, then he moved, much faster than the human eye could see to stand beside the two who had summoned him.

“Nor do you.” Michael spat back, a definite haughtiness in his tone that had been absent when speaking to the humans. The three magic users began to chant again.

The demon laughed raucously and his partner came up beside him as well. She glanced to the women.

“You two should go. Back to the cabin.” the female devil told them.

They tried to move, but found that it was as if their feet had been pinned to the road. That's when Brooke and Hunter both began to feel as if they were being bitten all over by fire ants. The other three were working a hex. Hunter sliced the palm of her hand and mumbled a few words of her own, and while the pain persisted, the two women were able to move, and they both hurried toward the car, the engine starting up when she twisted the key. She reversed and turned the car around, leaving the angels and demons behind.

Falielle scoffed as his head turned to watch the women's tail lights fade into the distance.

“Cowards.” the demon said bitterly, then looked back at the pair of winged beings standing in the road.

The humans behind them began chanting something else and advancing up behind the divine figures. The female demon let out a scream, the temperature around her rising and spectral flames began to dance around her. Anthony gasped when he saw the flare of that aura. His hand tightened on the cross around his neck as he repeated the words on the paper that Cameron and Fiona had written.

A moment later, there was a flash of golden light, and the demons found themselves on the ground.",1,1763417067.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! This is a post by Tom Raynor of Raynor Maritime. My name is Gigi and I’m a black disabled veteran that dated Tom’s son, Nathan Lord Raynor. 

During the course of the relationship, I informed Tom and his wife Janice that his son was relapsing, he has been an alcoholic and drug addict for years. I had been financially  supporting him for two months. He started becoming violent and was stealing from me, I informed his parents after he threatened to punch me in the face and I recorded it, they came and got him. 
Everytime I tried to break up with Nate, he did multiple suicide/self harm attempts and put himself in the psych ward. 

He then convinced his parents to to bring him 2.5 away from home to live behind the veteran owned coffee shop/brewery that I’ve gone to for 5 years in order to ‘definitely not stalk me’. 
Nathan also tried going to my mom’s house and asked her not to tell me.

About 3 weeks ago, Nate tried to murder me. He strangled me with the handle of a cleaning brush and then began beating himself with the object afterwards to make marks on himself. Some of these videos and recordings are on my page and also on the Instagram page @ctvalleypredators

He choked me, punched me, dragged me by my hair and tried to twist my breasts.

I begged Tom and his wife to get Nate mental health care for months. They did not care, they ignored me. 

So now Tom thinks it’s funny to call victims of domestic violence pigs on Facebook. Just wanted to let you know about some of your neighbors.

Do I have a good reason for asking for a divorce. Some of the more was cut off at the bottom but the important parts are all there.","In these last year our relationship has lost a lot of what I felt made it special, and that’s going to be the main focus of my argument, my feelings and needs and the fact that they have not been met and the constant fighting and insults that have come during those fights. 

When we’re in a relationship there are little things that our partners do that serve as daily reminders that our partner loves us and genuinely cares about us…the small things, and it can be anything like making our coffee for us in the morning, waiting outside of the shower holding our towel for us, rubbing lotion on our rough dry skin after a day of work and even making sure that they always kiss us goodnight and tuck us in, all of which are things that I used to do for you amongst other things that we’ve talked about and I made sure to do those things often, to bring you flowers to always make sure that you felt comfortable and to ask how your day went and to know that no matter if you spend the whole day on the sofa or working your butt off you were always doing enough and that I always loved you……where was that warmth for me? 

One point that you always bring up is when you helped me reinstate my drivers license….that was 3 years ago, you talked about how you helped me make it through school..more than 3 years ago, you talk about the deftones concert this year for my birthday, you talk about how you try to motivate me when my family doubts my ability to achieve my goals, these are acts that I am incredibly grateful for but a lot has been said and been done in between these grand gestures that has heavily eroded at our relationship and has left me feeling emotionally drained, stressed and resentful. I personally do not feel like these amazing things that you’ve done for me are worth anything if they’re immediately followed by periods of you lashing out in anger and making very insulting statements towards me “you lack the skills needed for women to want to reproduce with you” was probably one of the worst you’ve said and it was right after I fell through the ceiling and as you pointed out, could have been severely injured, but the constant fighting and insults aren’t the only issues for me, the fact that I haven’t been able to maintain a stable job for more than a few months has also created their own feelings of resentment within me, I know we shouldn’t use absolute’s but it has been every time that I get a new job that we start to have arguments over several different issues whether it’s the time I’m waking up, my performance at work, the time I get home, how tired I am from work, you say that you are supportive of me and my work but are you really?, while your emotions and feelings are very important to me and I’d never deny you the time to sit and talk I whole heartedly disagree with waking someone up at 1am-3am to have an emotionally charged conversation knowing that they have to go to work in the morning, this ultimately led to me feeling sleepy and tired at work and in the end I was fired due to performance issues. I know I’ve said it a few times already but when you worked at ….. I feel that I was very supportive, was I feeling a lack of affection from feeling like I had become invisible to you due to work? Yes I did, was the morning right before you had to go into work the right time for me to seek that affection? No it wasn’t, when you were getting ready for work did I always make you your coffee, oatmeal and tea along with a lunch bag with lunch and snacks enough to feed everyone else you worked with ? Yes I did, with only two hours before I myself had to go into for work did I not only get ….ready for school while also cleaning the entire house to make sure that you came home to a spotless home? Yes I did. Along with making sure that I made both of us breakfast. Where has any of that been for me? Consistently……or at all….your own mother has taken the time to make me my coffee and lunch for work more times than you have, you ask that these things be done for you and while these things are done not necessary expecting something in return but out of love I would like to at some point feel the love in return….and I haven’t. I feel that more time and effort has been put into a sort of professional development on your part in the form of criticism and I believe that while being able to take criticism is important I do feel like at some point we should have our strengths highlighted and praised again at some point not all the time, this is exactly what I’ve done for you in pointing out your hard work, the fact that you are an amazing mother, daughter and grand daughter and the awesome qualities that make up who you are as a person, if it wasn’t for you pushing your mom to go to the hospital she would have never know she had cancer or would have found it to late, either way I think you saved your moms life….thats amazing, I hate to say it but I don’t think nana would still be here if you hadn’t fixed her medication for her…..thats amazing…..you are amazing ….and I’ve communicated these things to you in the past, what have you communicate to me in the past? That my brother is dead because he was irresponsible? I got that response after I told you that I was concerned about your drug usage, That I’m a mamas boy for accepting help from her because I haven’t been able to hold a job these past three years?

this morning i had a middle aged couple come in for breakfast. i got them coffees, gave them a few on the menu, came back and they were ready to go. the woman orders a western omelet without even looking up from her phone, her husband got pancakes and sausage. the food comes out, everything looks great, coffees all set. cool! first time i go to check on them she is slightly annoyed. 

“you know, i didnt know there was mushrooms in the western. most places don’t do that in a western omelet usually.” i apologize to her and i say well hopefully youre able to pick around them! and add on it is a 3 egg omelet so at least youve got the eggs to work with (she also got potatoes And toast with the omelet). she nodded and said nothing else so i said my standard enjoy the rest of your meal and walked away. i took my opportunity to use the bathroom because they were one of my two tables at the moment & i had their check ready for my coworker if they finished up quick. 

turns out they finished up REALLY quick because after i was in the bathroom for maybe four minutes? my coworker was cashing them out and getting them takeout containers. she walked behind the counter and whispered to me “shes PISSED” and i was immediately so confused because she just seemed a little annoyed when i went to check on them? i grabbed them a bag for their containers and walked over to the table and she let me know just how pissed she was. she said “you know this was my first time here and i really wanted to enjoy it but i couldn’t. it tasted like cream of mushroom soup. just ridiculous i really wanted leftovers but now im not even going to enjoy them. its really ridiculous that you guys put mushrooms in that omelet literally nobody else does that.” i guess she had verbatim said that to my coworker as well. AND i guess she admitted she didn’t read the menu. but was pissed at us anyway. 

all i did was apologize again and let her know next time she could request the omelet without mushrooms and we’d be happy to make it for her. and that we do things a little different at our restaurant (bc frankly we do… its ACTUAL good food). she didn’t seem to care for any of my suggestions. at that point i didnt even know what she wanted from us, it seemed like she wanted a free replacement or have us offer to remake it without mushrooms but she also could have asked us to remake it too? its not my job to read you the description of what you’re ordering or make up your mind for you on how you’d like the problem to be solved. tell me exactly what you want and i will do everything in my power to get it for you. 

she also went out of her way to message the business on square after cashing out to say exactly the same thing; about it tasting like cream of mushroom soup, being disappointed, etc. it was super ridiculous. 

anyway, hope she learns to read the menu when she goes places now and doesnt bitch out the next person that innocently takes her order. 

and if your biggest problem of the day is you got mushrooms in your omelet, youve got a pretty damn good life lady.

I tried them","I've looked for an answer here and couldn't find one. The ingredient and chemical list is near identical. Buying a whole case from Costco is the only way to ""try"" the costco version. 

So I did. 

I like the Barista blend and it has become my go to. Barely distinguishable from milk both in microfoam structure and overall flavor. Great cappuccinos. 

Costco's ""Cafe"" blend is worse in a few ways that matter:

1. The taste is kind of wrong.  Its probably more sweetened with vanilla or something and it just tastes a little different.
2. The taste is a little chemical-y. Can't describe it but it doesn't taste right
3. The packaging results in spills. Not sure why they designed it this way but it's always pouring unpredictably. Am I doing it wrong? Look, I don't have any problems with pouring the Barista version which is packaged differently, so i'm going to say no, I am doing it normally and the packaging is badly designed. 

The only way it is better is that it is \~$5-8 cheaper than the Barista on Amazon per 6-pack. Which is no reason, IMO, to suffer from an inferior product. 

Others can debate the ingredient list or chemial components. I used and tasted both. I wanted the Costco one to be good, but the Barista blend is way, way better. Ah well.

Will try to be as concise as possible but will likely ramble on. I know that I will probably receive both support and discouragement/critique for what  may or may not happen, but I am just looking to understand what may or may not be happening.

I'm a middle-aged M and have known this middle-aged F for many years; both of us have been in long-term, serious relationships and thru marriages & other people we are part of large family group (she and I are NOT blood-related). We've always gotten on well and kept to ourselves in a friendly way and have always had normal/casual conversations at gatherings with no signs of anything nor interest...Well, none that I've ever noticed and I believe that I'm rather perceptive.

Over the last year or may be two, I've noticed or at least I've perceived our interactions to be different or more ""meaningful"" because of her non-verbal communication and I've developed a crush and have been wondering if she has also. I will try to list the ""signs"" that have me confused, but also unfortunately/fortunately made more interested in her.

\- She has invited me to ice cream/tea/coffee more than once. This in itself is harmless, but she has never been one to spend and much less pay for me. I don't remember there ever being a time when she has offered. This happened while we were both at her relatives home by coincidence then she asked me to join her. 

\- When ever we have conversations I've noticed that she releases her hair from her bun and/or plays with her her.

\-Despite there being other people at our gatherings, we spend a lot of time talking. A LOT more than we have ever had in previous years. Sometimes she makes an effort to go to where I am to talk with me even while there are people more important that she could be speaking with.

\-In our culture we're accustomed to saying hello/goodbye to the opposite sex with a hug and a ""kiss"". The hug is usually the kind where you arms embrace but your bodies do not touch and the kiss is just the sound of the kiss but your sides of your face/cheeks may or may not touch. However, my lips always kiss her cheek, then we embrace with body contact but not in a sexual way...just a nice subtle intimate way. She used to always pat my back during the hug, but not so much lately. Sometimes I've felt her actually pull me to her rather firmly.

\-Lately, after the embrace we've had very brief words after the hug but we've maintained the physical contact where we would separate but her hand was on my arm and my hand on her back/waist.

\-We've had that ""last glance"" as we walk away a few times.

There are other things that may or may not be relevant but I will leave it at that. So what do you think? Have you ever had a similar experience? Is it just the itch of mid-life crisis where I'm reliving those beautiful feelings of my youth and am projecting them onto someone with whom I have a good rapport?

When I was in high school, I asked for a Keurig for Christmas (my parents don’t drink coffee). My sister and I both used it throughout high school and then when I moved out, I left it at my parents. My sister continued to use it while she was living there, and I continued to use it when I visit my parents (I have a small stash of K cups that I store at their house so I can have a cup of coffee in the morning and continued to clean it throughout the years).

When I last went to visit my parents, I saw that the Keurig wasn’t there and I asked about it. My mom said my sister had taken it to her new house. I said it was my Keurig and that I like to have it there so I can have a cup of coffee in the morning during the one weekend a month I usually spend with my parents. I ended up going to Dunkin Donuts for coffee that weekend, but I mentioned to my sister that she took my Keurig (and implied that I wanted it back). She got snippy and said she wasn’t going to buy a new one when there was a perfectly good one that wasn’t being used. I told her she could consider that her housewarming gift from me then and she said I was being an asshole.

I am a professor from Carleton College in Minnesota (in the United States), and I am currently conducting a study on the experiences of people who grew up in Turkish Cypriot mixed-marriage families (specifically where one parent is a Turkish Cypriot and the other is from a different national background). I am particularly interested in learning about people’s experiences with applications or interactions involving citizenship status in the Republic of Cyprus, any challenges encountered, and how these experiences have shaped feelings of identity, belonging, and community.  
  
I want to emphasize that I am not evaluating or promoting any political viewpoint. I am simply listening to people’s personal experiences, in their own words, however they understand them. The goal is to contribute to a clearer, more human understanding of everyday life and identity in Cyprus.  
  
This study has already involved several interviews, and I am now seeking to include a wider range of voices so that the research does not reflect only one pathway or perspective. Participation involves a confidential conversation (about one hour), either in person during my upcoming visit to Cyprus or via Zoom/WhatsApp. I will be on the island from November 29–December 14 and can meet you for a coffee or a meal (my treat!). I will be based in Nicosia but can meet anywhere that is convenient to you. If you would prefer to speak in Turkish, please feel free to reach out; I may be able to arrange an interpreter.  
  
The research is fully approved by the ethics board at my home institution in the US. All names and identifying details are kept confidential in any publications. This work will contribute to an academic article (not journalism or political commentary), and I am happy to share the results with anyone who participates.

It's that time of the year.  
Christmas Coffee time.

Despite living in Australia, where Christmas is in the middle of summer, i love a good Christmas blend so thought i'd start this thread to list a few i have found so far.  
Feel free to add any Christmas coffees you've found, and if you've tried, feel free to leave your review as well.

I'll kick off with a few coffees, mostly from here in Australia (noting that often Australian roasters do Christmas blends, rather than a single origin Christmas coffee).

  
[Wood and Co - Fruit Cake Festive Blend](https://woodandcocoffee.com.au/products/fruit-cake-festive-season-blend?variant=43799730356303)

Wood and Co are a great little roaster here in Melbourne and their Christmas blend is always a cracker.  
This years is a blend of a natural Ethiopian and a washed Kenyan.

[September Coffee - Candy Cane Bark](https://september.coffee/en-au/products/candy-cane-bark)

I'm sure many will be familiar with this coffee, but if not, it's a thermal shock from Diego Bermudez of Finca El Paraiso.  
It's not for the faint of heart, as it usually has big minty notes (hence the candy cane reference), with some Christmas-sy spices underneath.  
I've got a few bags on the way to me here in Australia.

  
[Veneziano Coffee - Festive Blend](https://venezianocoffee.com.au/products/festive-blend?variant=43850912694524)

  
Whilst i don't always love Venez coffee (a large roastery here in Melbourne), i've always loved their Christmas blends.  
In fact, i've still got one in the freezer from two years ago that was loaded with that XO process coffee from CGLE.  
This year it's a blend of Ethiopian and PNG coffees.  
I tried it at one of their stores and whilst it wasn't as good as previous years, it's still very Christmas-sy.

[Locale Espresso - Festive AF](https://localeespresso.com.au/product/festive-af/)

This is a roaster i haven't had too much experience with as they tend to roast a bit darker than i like, but this one sounds interesting and a portion of the proceeds goes to charity.

1oztjmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1oztjmh/that_time_i_agreed_to_print_a_document_for_a_guest/,That time I agreed to print a document for a guest,"I was reminded of this encounter (and many similar ones) by a recent post.

So, let me set the scene...

I work NA (PT these days) at a small, rural Mediocre Southern Inn. We do have a business center, but it is off of the lobby and we lock up at 11PM until 6AM. We tend to our guests through a night window during that time.  I'm a boomer, but I'm the kind of boomer who built websites back in the 90's by writing html and (later) Javascript. For fun. So, I know how to work a computer. I'm not great with a phone, but I get by.

On to the story...

It had been a typically quiet Monday night so far, it was approaching 4AM. I was done with audit, had filed my paperwork, made coffee, eaten lunch and was just chillaxing when the doorbell in the vestibule rang. 

I immediately jump up, pause the video I was watching and fast-walked to the window (I kinda play a game in my head with the doorbell, if I get to the window before the guest finds the window, I win! Spoiler ... the window is not even remotely hidden). In this instance I did win, opened the window and said ""Good morning. How can I help?""

Our guest, a gentleman of my approximate age (maybe a bit younger) was standing at the locked door. He looked over at me and says 'I need to use the printer'.

I explain that the lobby, and therefore the business center, is closed until 6AM.

Guest: I need to print some paperwork before work, at 6.

Me: (hopefully) I can run copies for you.

Now he comes to the window. 

Guest: Can you print a page from my phone? (holding his phone up)

Me (internally): ugh, no

Me (out-loud): I'm not comfortable handling your phone, I'm a bit of a klutz. If you can email it to me, I can try.

Guest (brightening): Oh, OK. How do I do that?

\*Sigh\*

And we spent about 10 minutes getting thru that. He finally seemed comfortable with it and retired to the bench in the vestibule to compose his email while I went to the computer to await said email. 

Several minutes pass. I look at the camera monitor and see he is still sitting on the bench poking his phone. I wait patiently several more minutes. Finally I see that he has put his phone down, so I'm expecting the email at any second. A few more minutes pass and I begin to wonder what the odds are that he got the email address wrong. After checking my email again, I head over to the window to ask.

Guest assures me he sent it, and (in true guest fashion) holds his phone in my face so I can verify as much. Welp, back to the computer ... still no email.

I go back to the window and suggest that since this is taking much longer than it should he needn't wait in the vestibule. He can stop by before work to pick it up. Guest agrees and off he goes.

And I return to the computer to await the email. The incredibly slow email ....

But finally an email appeared. I open it expecting a PDF file that I can print off real quick.

Wait, whats this? 6 png files? 

I'm thinking ""this better not be d!kpics"" 

And then 3 more emails showed up, each with their own 5 - 6 png files. My eye starts twitching.

I open the first png file. It is a large file. It is a picture of a document, out of focus and skewed so that part of the document is missing. Seriously? I looked at more of the files, they are all similar out of focus photos of papers on a desk. What is this guy up to??

Then I realize, I don't care. I said I would print it, so I did. Approximately 20 pages of unreadable garbage. I neatly stacked them and used a binder clip to hold them together, with a note containing his name and his room number.

I had it all ready for him before 5:30AM, which is about when I was expecting him since he said he needed it for work at 6. 

6AM came and went, Guest did not show up. 7AM arrived, bringing my relief. I explained to her about the stack of useless pages and she rolled her eyes. ""Don't worry, I got this"" is all she said on the subject. I didn't worry.

When I got back to work Tuesday night the stack of garbage was still there. No one ever mentioned it to me again. 

What I learned from this encounter is never agree to do a thing without setting boundaries.

1oztin3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaxRecoveryGroup/comments/1oztin3/my_recovery_story/,My recovery story,"Hey. Decided to post here today to give hope to those who still fight. This is not a medical advice, but I will share what worked for me. But some timeline first:

Nov 2020 - first Covid infection, Immediate loss of taste and smell, 2 - 4 days with temperature and flu-like symptoms. Reversed circadian rhytm (awake during the night, sleeping during the day). Continued fatigue and lack of smell and taste for about 6 months. Around March 2021 fully recovered.

July 2021 - got my J&J shot. No symptoms except for fever, extreme exhaustion for about 24 hours. Only ongoing issue I could complain about was around sinuses (lots of mucus for months).

May 2024 - First weird symptoms - lack of appetite. Prolonged voluntary fasting (up to 3 - 4 days) with no negative consequences (I even worked out in the gym on a daily basis without eating anything).

June 2024 - One day experienced something like a mini-stroke. Heavy derealization episode, vision issues (2d vision), 80% of smell and taste lost, extreme fatigue, depression, light sensitivity. Lack of sex drive, feeling of emptiness. Experienced weird ""clicking"" sounds in my head, head pressure. Diagnosed with high transferrin, intestines inflammation without known cause, minor blood issues. Otorhinolaryngologist couldn't find the source of my lack of taste and smell, prescribed steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs, no effects. Hardcore brain fog, inability to capture and process information while on work meetings. Sporadically headaches. My vision impaired (2D + I couldn't observe two people simultaenously, had to look at either one of them). I managed to alleviate 2d vision issues with nicotine patches (half of a 6mg patch).

July/August 2024 - Clicking sounds continued, paranoia and depression peaked. The only thing that helped me to feel normal was water fasting, although at day 3 caused fatigue and sleepiness. Also, I experienced more headaches and inability to get drunk/high. The depth of my sensory experiences (touch, sound, vision) greatly reduced. Sensitivity to touch and temperatures reduced. Almost like someone would turn down a knob on my ability to sense.

Autumn 2024 - Despite ongoing symptoms and basically being bedridden (and on sick leave at work) I've begun short, 20 minutes trainings (low intensity - yoga or push ups, squats max. 20). It caused discomfort, but I pushed through. Experienced headaches but accidentally found a treatment (beer with rosemary). That beer actually removed the headache and allowed me to feel tipsy first time in months. Later I begun drinking rosemary water (basically boiled rosemary) whenever I had an extreme headache. Worked. I found a supplement for liver health that had artichoke extract, chlorella, choline citrate, silimarina extract, luteolin, L-glutathione and SAMe. Taken it after a night out (I resumed social contacts around August). Surprisingly, it made my brain fog go away and within 2 weeks I was back to work. Not the best version of myself, but acceptable. Sex drive slowly returned, although never reached pre-vax baseline.

Winter 2024 - Continued with rosemary water, liver supplement, sporadically with nicotine patches (when liver supplement wasn't sufficient for mental clarity). Introduced microdoses of psilocybin mushrooms (0.05 - 0.10g daily except for weekends). Definitely helped at work. I have also returned to study languages. Still doing low intensity 20 minutes training. Sex drive slowly returned to near-normal.

Spring 2025 - Begun experiencing eye floaters. Eye doctor has not identified any retinal detachment. Got into heavy investigation on covid vaccines (totally unnecessary, it makes things worse). Continued with winter treatment.

Summer 2025 - Experienced some dp/dr episodes (basically feeling like in a simulation), increased number of eye floaters, headaches. Continued with winter treatment, but reduced alcohol and followed my friends advice to start running. Also, spent more time indoors reading.

October 2025 - Hit 48.6km mark on monthly performance. Running 2 - 3x a week 3.5 - 8km (depends on the day/weather/mood). Smell and taste stabilized at around 20 - 30% of pre-vax baseline, no further alterations. Brain fog eliminated completely - I'm fully operational at work. Continuing with rosemary water, introduced fresh/dry pineapple and papaya, drinking coffee with coconut oil and curcumin. Occasionally vitamin C and other supplements. At the moment the only diagnosed issue I have is related to lowered good cholesterol and lack of some pancreatic enzymes (I'm supplementing them). Some food starts to taste like back in the days (I consider it a good sign).

In the end I've proven to myself that I'm tough, despite having some suicidal thoughts during the depression peaks. Yes, my vision is not perfect and it's deteriorating but I'm searching for solutions instead of looking for conspiracy theories. It is a tremendous success that I managed to turn my life from being bedridden to doing 2 - 3 workouts a week and looking forward to run a 10km and subsequently 21km race in the next quarter. My appetite for life is slowly returning and I believe so is my health. Even if it doesn't get better, it's not that bad as it used to be a year ago. I can enjoy pleasures of life and actually plan ahead instead of being trapped in a cycle of negative thoughts.

Fun facts: 1) when I first got sick with covid I did an anti-viral mixture of curcumin, coconut oil and saffron. This is exactly what I take with my coffee these days. What I'm trying to say is that your organism knows what it needs and what it wants. Test what you eat, test your supplements and follow your cravings. And if you feel like you don't want anything, then fasting is what you should do. 2) the only thing that actually makes me feel worse and increases the number of eye floaters is sun and heat exposure. It's odd, but I feel better indoors and in cold.

1oztf3m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oztf3m,(Sublease Dec. 15th - May 31st) Modern 2-Bed in Prime Bushwick with Tons of Sunlight and Great Amenities ($3500),"Subleasing our great 2-bed, 1-bath apartment in the heart of Bushwick. We seriously love this place, but a friend is moving to NYC and we need to upgrade to a 3-bed.

The apartment itself feels modern and really comfortable. It’s a 2017 building, so everything is updated: appliances, finishes, windows, HVAC, all of it. High ceilings, a surprisingly spacious bathroom, and a layout that actually makes sense. Both bedrooms get a ton of natural light and have more space than you usually find in the area. We both have full-sized beds, full desks, and still have extra room left over. There’s a proper balcony, central AC and heat, and plenty of closet space.

Dates are December 15 through May 31. These dates are firm, so please don’t message asking for alternatives. I already have one guy interested, so if you’re solo, you could move in with him. If you’re a pair and want the whole apartment, that works too and is probably the simplest.

Location: 709 Hart St. It’s a two-minute walk to the M at Central, eight minutes to the L at Jefferson, and three minutes to Maria Hernandez Park. The immediate area has a ton of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and stores, but the block itself is quiet and residential, so you’re not dealing with noise from clubs or late-night spots. 

Rent is $3600 total ($1800 per person.) Water is included. Electric and internet are separate. Electric varies, and internet depends on whichever provider/plan you choose.

Amenities include onsite laundry, a gym, a big social room/common area, an elevator, a lobby, and an absolutely incredible rooftop. Photos genuinely don’t do the roof justice.

Somebody with a cute haircut wearing equally cute glasses walks up to the car and asks my kid ""is this your wallet""? 

Yes, yes it was. And you allowed us to barely make the flight. For some reason, you found the wallet on the side walk, looked at the id, and waited around for us to come back. Then you just heard a weak thank you as we sped off. If you are reading this, message me. I owe you a coffee or a drink.

1oztb07,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_fangs444/comments/1oztb07/a_brief_history_of_why_nothing_matters/,"A Brief History of Why Nothing Matters - Introduction and Story 1: ""China Kitty""","I am the whisper in your ear that begs you to jump at the edge of a cliff. I am the invisible thing that holds you down in dreams, paralyzing you, making you carry that hesitation to every important decision in the waking world that you have failed at. I am the reason sex was called sodomy. I am the foreign language you beg for your life in, right before some boy from a richer country guns you down. I am the fucked and broken feeling you have as you stare at the void, knowing you are absolutely worthless. 



Infinity means nothing without its zeroes. And you shitty fleshy cousins of walking fish ARE zeroes. All I had to do was give you a couple nudges in the right direction to make your life a sad and self-poisoning, pointless misery. Sometimes I don’t have to work. Sometimes I get to sit back and laugh as you beg a God for things, setting yourself up for cosmic disappointment. I eat that shit up like metaphysical popcorn. Watching you blame yourselves, scouring your life for a misdirection, trying to figure out when you sinned, grasping desperately at straws to find why your daddy in the sky won’t give you everything you want. I am your loss of faith, your diatribe about floating rocks and being a monkey on it. I am the first time you hear of the heat death of the universe, not that your civilization will survive to see that anyway.



I am the connection you make about the sexual proclivities of your politicians and billionaires, that click of your synapses when a conspiracy stops being a theory. I am that helpless feeling that you got to inherit a world pre-ruined for you. I am the black nihilism that allows degenerates to make a living making jokes about how doomed humanity really is, or hours of content complaining, spreading hopelessness like a virus. I love to watch you losers pat yourselves on the back, creating fake titles to prove how you are so intellectual, as you turn genocide, suicide, and mass violation into something small and digestible for your little academic papers. I am philosophy, a way to obscure and systematize your misery, taking you so deep inside yourself that you don’t realize you have long ago internalized that disappointment is everything life has to offer.  



You, who are well read, will recognize what I have known all along. The term “death of the author”. I find that term cute and endearing, like the way you’ll label whisked cream as Cool Whip. For you, it is the death of the narrative, a realization that life is not a story; you have no arc, and you will die with many questions unanswered. I am that brief moment of panic when you see there is no light at the end of the tunnel, but your body has already given up too much to bring you back.



In your own terms, I’m best understood as the “view from nowhere”, the ivory tower academics muse and pretend to know things in, a lame exchange for living off food stamps and wet dreams about their undergrads. 



Would you believe, in all my acidity, that I do have favorite stories from whatever presumed legacy you, as a stain, leave behind? I am a collector of these murky chronicles, and you, my lucky audience, will receive the gift of my retellings. I’m sure you can tell, I am highly selfish, so you may be asking why I would care to show you these rarities. As your species grows in number, you’ve taken all the fun out of watching you. You no longer believe in magic, the stars, or Allah. You have created a non-stop marathon of self-deprecation about being doomed, and in perfect human fashion, you’ve lost your reasons for it. You feel sad merely because it’s comfortable, with no urge to escape.



I am bored of you, and lately your stories have been redundant and inadequately mystical. Through these vignettes, I will provide an addendum to that little whisper the next time you find yourself at the ledge of some fourth-story building, holding off only because you wanted your death to be from higher up, more of a spectacle. I want you to remember these and hold off thinking, “at least that didn’t happen to me.” I want to give you a false promise that things could be worse. I want you to see your misery through, to have hope, so I can crush you again. I want you for a brief glimpse to think that it will get better as I pull you in and slip the painful blade of truth in-between your ribs. Because I can promise you, it only gets so much worse. 



**China Kitty**

“*Hi Angel, I visited your grave again today. I brought a mix of Carnations and Dahlias, though you would have smacked me over the head for the clash of the colors. It was a light rain, one of those mid-November fogs that we would have spent splitting a j by the open window with a book and a sketchpad. I miss you every day, Kathleen. Sometimes I catch a whiff of your cheap patchouli roll-on perfume drifting past me as I’m making coffee. I see you with muddy clay-covered hands as you smiled up at me from behind the banding wheel, making a mug or a modern statue of Venus. I remember your soft exhales as you looked up at the ceiling on top of me, your stifled whispers of ecstasy as we tried not to wake your roommates up. I wish I could’ve given you that baby. I wish I hadn’t fought you so hard over us working in coffee shops and restaurants, barely making enough to pay for our own food. I would have quit smoking, and we’d have an extra 15 dollars every other day to spend on a thrifted rain jacket or little red boots as we walked on either side of a small miracle we made, with its hand wrapped around a finger or two on the way to a park or a trail. I remember how you cried as I tried to push you away for so long, you begging me to stop being such a coward, saying that we might never find a love like this again. Your big doe eyes welled with tears as I held you and ran my fingers through your hair, trying with more effort than I’d ever put into school to not lift up your bangs. You always hated that. I will always love you, and I will see you again, Kitty. Please don’t be disappointed if I show up gray and old.*

*Happy Birthday Angel,*

*Yours Forever,*

*--*	*Wiley”*



The thin and ratty blond boy delicately placed his handwritten letter between a marble vase and a gravestone in a small spot shaded by a tree in hopes it wouldn’t get wet. He laid the floral arrangement down and picked it up again, trying out several places and things to leave it next to. He chose to put them front and center, surrounded by candles burned until the wick was no more, and trinkets her family had left behind. There was a Radiohead mixtape she made for a boy she liked in high school, a small clay worm with a face from 2nd grade, and a copy of *Valley of the Dolls*  which they thought was still her favorite book. Last was a Polaroid of their dog Monty, swollen and turning pink. It had been a rainy week. Wiley took a deep breath through his nose, kissed his index and middle finger, and placed them softly on the top of her grave, the rough beveling a cold reminder that’s the closest he’d ever get to grazing her soft skin, which would stay oddly warm even when it snowed, again. He hated goodbyes. They seemed to never end with this girl. He laughed at that thought. Even in death, she pushed him out of his comfort zone. 



He turned away quickly, trying to wipe that lonely thought from his mind. He tried to imagine he was visiting someone else, that she’d be at home, not defrosting the chicken. And it was okay because he wanted Halal from the corner for dinner instead. They’d say over spilled saffron rice that THIS was going to be the last time they eat out until the next paycheck, like, for real this time. 30 minutes later, they’d go out for ice cream or a chocolate croissant. No. It’s best to be a realist. He’d stopped the magical thinking about 6 months after she died. There were only so many flies around the house that he could say were her teasing him from the great beyond. There were only so many times he could be glued to his phone before his eyes drifted to the time, seeing a 4:44 or some other angel number. She loved those small moments when there was something else out there, something she didn’t know enough to be cynical about. Wiley’s therapist told him in many flowery and college-educated words that he had to drop those little comforting lies–  that was the first step to letting her go. His eyes stung as he walked away, and his face felt wet. He thought, of course it’s wet, it’s raining. 



Kathleen Flores’ grave lay at the back of Hartford Cemetery, a collection of grassy hills so big it seemed a miracle anyone could find their way around. During his walks back to the front gate, which divided the gravel parking lot from rotting bodies who’d had their cars sold or gifted, Wiley liked to unfocus his eyes and pretend he did not exist. He pressed fast-forward in his head, trudging through the mud, *squelch squelch squelch*. His Doc Martens sank into the earth, and he pulled them out like a suction cup holder from the wall, a cheapskate attempt at a DIY coat rack. He stepped into a puddle that was deeper than expected, and the water splashed up onto his belly, bringing him back to the present. His eyes focused, surrounded by unfamiliar headstones, way older than he was used to seeing on his walk back. He was lost. He looked at the trees; moss grows…North? He didn’t know if the entrance was North or not. He followed the moss, tracing his hands along the bark, cursing himself that he had to spend any longer around reminders that she was gone. Then, he started running. At first, what is referred to as a “White Person Jog” before breaking into a sprint. His lungs burned; he completely ignored his lack of athleticism, balance, or spatial coherence, with only one thought: *out! Out! OUT!*



Wiley tried to unfocus his eyes before feeling his left leg sink deeper than his right, halting his momentum and throwing him face-first into wet black mulch. He had dirty water in his contacts; the irony that his eyes *really* couldn’t focus now was not lost on him. He pushed himself off the ground, feeling something, probably a rock, poke into his palm. It supported his weight for a moment before a hollow cracking sound as the rock gave out and pierced his hand. “FUUUUUCKKKK bro.” He yelled and thought, “Surprise! Today sucks.” The warm liquid pooled in his hand as he realized he was rubbing nasty skeleton people dirt into an open wound.



 He had never crushed a rock before. He had never even tried. He looked down at his palm to see an explosion of tiny white splinters, some watercolored, some with thin gold lines gleaming a pale yellow hue, before bright blood swallowed up his view of his maimed hand. He made his wrist limp and flailed his hand around before picking out as many lacquered shards as he could see. He looked down to observe the point of impact. Lying at his feet was a constellation of what looked like…. A broken plate? No, too many of the pieces were contorted with too many smooth and winding edges. The largest piece still intact was staring up at him. Big watercolor pupils, a pink nose, and a wide “W” of a mouth. He would have laughed if it weren't such a sick joke. In his blind fumbling, he had crushed a small porcelain statue of a housecat. He tried to surmise his surroundings. The 1 and a ½ foot deep boot-shaped imprint he had made kept a small rock with text too weathered to read at its head. His heart sank, the consequences of his clumsiness setting in. He had sunk into a burial plot and destroyed the only gift left to commemorate whoever rested here. 



His first thought was not his best thought. “Ok, maybe everyone who remembers this lady is dead too.” He slapped his hand to his face. This person was someone’s Kathleen once. Maybe they still are. Maybe she hated flowers because of her allergy to pollen, and her one true passion was collecting fine china. That seemed infinitely more benign than the pile of black Santas collecting dust in his Aunt’s living room. He wanted to fix this, and for a brief moment, a magical thought crept back into his mind. “It’s what Kathleen would’ve wanted.” He pocketed as many shards as he could find. As he zipped his jacket pocket up, he felt the rain begin to slow. In the distance, he saw a tall angel statue that he recognized. He started towards it before an odd hollow entered his chest. There was a fluttery jerk echoing through his sternum, before he swallowed the fear into a stomach clenching in on itself until it felt like a taut piece of rubber. He chalked it up to his immune system recognizing the coming infection. He dry swallowed an Ativan on the drive home anyway.



Before returning home, he stopped at Café le Lit, which used to be a home away from home for him. These days, he only stopped in on special occasions. He zipped up his windbreaker to conceal the massive mud stain on his shirt and hoped anyone could believe the stains on his jeans were from some type of manual labor. He traveled past the decorated bookshelves to the back, where the pastry line was. He put in his order, keeping his bloodied hand in the empty pocket, and paid the 12 dollars for his dirty chai and chocolate croissant. Money was so much less important these days. 



As he grabbed his order, he felt a tightening in his forearm flexor. He was walking toward the door when it twitched again, closing tightly around the paper cup. The lid gave out with a small pop, and the freshly steamed milk flooded his closed fist and trickled down into his jacket sleeve. As he hopped from one leg to the other, he tried and failed to reopen his fist. He rushed out with his face on fire, so embarrassed that he didn’t notice the display of vintage postcards he’d knocked to the ground. “I’m useless without you, Kitty” played over and over in his head. Please don’t let me be useless without you.



He drove home in silence as the rain began again. There was that feeling. Was it panic? He tried to cross his stiff fingers and prayed it was a mid-20s heart attack. No such luck.



When he got back to his apartment, he took off all his clothes and cried in the shower. He let the water run over his raw and torn-up hand as it continued to ooze blood and now, pus. He tried to drip his 3-in-1 body wash into the gash, only to jump at his own guttural shriek. He squawked in pain, laying his face against cool tile, looking for any sensation to distract him. He felt a bulge he hadn’t noticed traveling deeper into his hand, beginning to hit muscle. Then, a whisper: *Grab it.*



There were two large slits in his right hand, close enough to agitate each other when he extended his fingers, and a small island of flesh lay in between them. He wrenched his left hand into a claw with his teeth, and he guided it with his elbow into the bigger slit. He felt the ends of the slit stretch and split a little. It was too late now to turn back. He ground his teeth, contracting his temporomandibular joint so hard he thought his teeth would crack against each other. He tried not to pass out or throw up, knowing that if bile landed inside of it, he’d have to take himself to urgent care. He clenched harder as stomach acid and barely digested pâte feuillete with chocolate swirls made their way through the gaps in his teeth before he swallowed again. The Ativan residue was bitter going down again. He felt the bump under a small pile of tissue. He reached deeper, grimacing; It’s almost over, it’s almost out. He found a fold in the muscle he could reach through and felt a little porcelain oval. It was deeper than he thought it was. He dug deeper, trying his best not to pluck the thin tubes he assumed were arteries. The whisper came again, *PULL PULL*, but he was in too much pain for any sort of language to register. As he groped around, he felt the back of his cuticle graze something hard and textured, almost slimy. He had found his way to his tendons. In an instant, he thought of every animal he had torn apart, his canines shredding their joints before his bicuspids ground them to a paste. He thought of cheap Pho, a watery broth that softened bones over the course of twelve hours or more. He thought of his father's brisket, trapped in a slow cooker overnight, slowly disintegrating the muscle fibers that had held the cow’s chest intact in life. Meat, he told himself, it’s just meat. And for an odd moment, he felt a grumble in his stomach. *Hungry, you are hungry.* The bitter paste of his failing benzo reached the back of his tongue. 



Pain is really just a series of electrical zaps traveling through your nervous system, he chanted, and tried his best to turn it off. The blood pooled and pooled, as he became cold and woozy. He couldn’t believe he had this much blood to spare. He watched his bathroom get darker. Had someone turned the lights off? Just when he thought this was how he would go out, and that his landlord would find his dead and soiled body, wrinkly like a raisin, he slipped his fingers under the porcelain bulb. He tried, with as much precision as he could muster, to push it back through the tendons and muscle. It snagged God knows what on its way back out. He heard the whisper again, a woman’s voice. *In you, I am in you now.* He let his fingers close around the bulb to pull it through the palmar fascia, into the epidermis. The tight ball his fingers were in was much bigger now that they held his buried treasure. The gripped porcelain ball expanded the split, ripping further up his hand, nearing his wrist. He tried to uncurl his fingers in an attempt to remove the smooth ball externally, but they were frozen in place once again. Finally, his fingers were outside of his wound once again, and as he forced the object out of his grip, he was able to see what it was. Lying on his shower tiles was a small porcelain paw, intact with a clean break at its wrist. He took a final glance at his wound, poking his tongue out. Animals are supposed to lick their wounds, right? He swatted the thought away before rushing out of the shower. 



Rummaging through the first aid kit, hardly used, sitting in the bottom shelf of a moldy vanity someone had left on their porch step, he began to hyperventilate, looking for something to stop the bleeding. Among several boxes of naloxone (not that they had ever been used, but it felt like the 40-dollar thought that counts) was a tube of Neosporin that he promptly emptied into his wound. The blood trailed like rivers around a cloudy delta of antibacterial sludge into the first aid kit, staining loose tablets of Benadryl and Zyrtec. Kathleen’s old inhaler, which she covered with Lisa Frank stickers, gazed up at him, begging to be useful one more time. It was probably expired by now. He stuffed the edges of cotton pads into the slits, not thinking about the loose hairs he’d have to pull out of his hand once the blood and plasma crusted over. He wrapped every piece of gauze he could find as tightly as he could around his throbbing wound and then applied several layers of duct tape for good measure.  He raided an empty fridge and pantry for anything to raise his blood sugar, but only found old ketchup packets. They popped in his mouth like a juice-filled gummy. He spat the empty packet on the ground, and they came out with a shard of enamel. Dizzy, he stumbled to his bed pale and naked, and used the last bit of energy he had left to pop another Ativan before he lost consciousness. As his field of vision grew dark, he felt a hot and rotten air fall on his face like a homeless mouthbreather was nose-to-nose on top of him. His final effort was to try not to retch at the smell; the only thing worse than dying in the shower is drowning naked in a puddle of your own vomit.



With a good deal of work, Wiley forced his eyelids apart, cracking the seal of mucus that had crusted over in his sleep. It was dark outside. He was spooning his windbreaker, with his wounded hand no longer bleeding but not without leaving a dry brown hickey on his bedsheets. His left hand had loosened a little, enough to be considered a claw. He sat up and reached for the light switch.  There were several little clicks, but the room stayed dark. He thought, “My retarded landlord blew a fuse.” He threw his head back and bonked it against the wall. Kathleen hated it when he said gay or retarded, except after a couple of glasses of wine, when it was the funniest thing in the world to her. She’d tipsily complain about her day, her burnout coworkers, and would cock her eyebrow when she talked about an especially rude customer. That was his cue to call them retarded. 



Sweeping his feet off the bed and onto the floor, he felt soft fur slip between his legs but heard no steps and saw no movement in the dark. He returned to the vanity to collect some boxers, and with some luck, dignity, when he saw a shadow pass by his window. As he dropped his legs into the waistband and through the plaid polyester sleeves, he started to place himself a little better. People were still walking outside, so it couldn’t have been that late. When he looked back up at the mirror, he saw the shadow again, now still. It had gone from the left side to the center, blocking the main source of outside light, and painted a more defined outline of his observer. It couldn’t have been the same person; it seemed nearly a foot taller. Unless it had come closer? 



Wiley shuddered, thinking some old perv had been taking pictures of him splayed out and naked. He tried to say fuck off, but a lump of mucus must have hardened his sleep, so it came out as a sad gurgle. He cleared his throat and opened his mouth, determined to be intimidating this time, but watched as the figure’s chin extended, hollowing out its cheeks. Its mouth was open too. Maybe it would say something? Maybe it was a misunderstanding, and they felt like a total creep? Maybe it wasn’t a pervy old man but a 22-year-old bombshell who was a little weird about sexual boundaries, but was hot enough to look past that. Not that it mattered anyway. He hadn’t been able to get hard since Kathleen had passed, except for what he called a “tasteful” Polaroid. He had taken it when they were still in college. Trapped in the thermal paper, she tucked her chin into her collarbone, her big nose (which he loved) poking past her fried platinum hair, grinning as if she was shy, but obviously in complete control of him. He couldn’t do anything about it either because if he looked at it too long, he started to cry. 



The figure continued to stare back at him, both of their mouths agape, waiting for the other to say something. Just as he started to string the words “What the fuck is going on?” together, it began to lift its arms from its hips to its shoulders, extending its wingspan fully. Wiley noticed a couple of things as it moved jerkily. The figure was a woman, thin and malnourished, to the point where her hip bones poked further out than her thighs. Her long, slender arms, which must have reached past her knees at rest, lifted; her torso and chest became more defined. Despite being thin enough to be the victim of years of human rights violations, her breasts sagged wide and low, areolas pointed straight down, attached to nipples that looked like droplets of wax about to fall. It was just as Wiley thought, this lady couldn’t get any further from a hot girl that his eyes fell downward. In between the spindly tubes that had to have been legs, he saw a long, overgrown bush. It looked like it was wet and dripping. 

 

“What the fuuuuuuuuck…. What the fuck is happening right now?”. Whatever mental patient had fallen off the transport bus was naked outside of his window. Its fingers had sprouts growing out from under its fingernails, like seeds had taken root and began to reach towards light. There was a soft *clunk* as it pressed its forehead against the glass and swung its chin like a pendulum back and forth. There was a rubbery squeak as Wiley realized it was dragging its tongue across his window. The grotesque figure rested its entire weight, which could not have been more than 85 lbs, onto one hip and he watched as she rotated her spine around her pelvis in a painfully slow orbit. It sucked its torso in, revealing a ribcage so prominent that it might as well have had gills. And when she pushed it back out, her diaphragm filled with air, making her swollen as if she had a beer belly. 



The whisper came again, as if it were right behind him. *Run boy run.* His legs trembled as his shoulders turned, buckling as his center of gravity traveled faster than his feet, and he landed on fully extended arms. He felt two cracks at once, the crack of the scab on his right palm and an instant depressurization as pus flowed out. The other was a tight and dainty *krrrriick* after a short bend of his left thumb bent backward past 90 degrees, then 120, and kept going until it was a useless floppy sausage that swayed around, slapping against the back of his hand. Now on his knees, Wiley tried to bring himself to his feet without putting any weight on his hands. He flexed his lower back, bringing his head up as if he were doing a perverted version of an Islamic Isha. He hopped up onto the balls of his feet and felt the plantar wart he’d been ignoring outside of bored experiments with nail clippers. He pressed his foot down with so much force that he felt the small clump of HPV ridden skin all the way to the root. As he fumbled through the darkness in pain, he became increasingly aware of his poorly cared-for body giving out on him. Isn’t fight or flight supposed to do the opposite? With another step, he heard a third and final firecracker chain of little snaps as he stepped on his windbreaker pocket, the remaining pieces of the feline statue breaking into too many pieces to count. He felt the pieces slice through the poorly insulated layers and into his foot. *Inside you, I am Inside you.* 



Limping now, Wiley made his way into the living room, where a familiar electric whine and uneven *whirrr* grabbed his attention. The banding wheel. Wasn’t the power supposed to be out? He tried to fumble to the kitchen past the laundry room (it was a miracle that it came with the apartment) to the front door. As he plopped his bleeding foot on the floor as quickly as he could, he felt thin fibers penetrate and enter the lacerations in his foot. He thought, “There is no way my floor is this dirty”. The thin beam of light that broke through from underneath his front door divided into three pieces. Someone was at the door. He screamed, “HELP,” hoping that it was anyone other than whatever was outside of his window. He knew it wasn’t. The fibers clumped together, tangling into a ball. Cat hair. *Inside you, I am inside you.* Wiley tried to walk faster toward the front door, both his feet becoming wet. He heard a sad drawl from behind him, “*Wiiiiiiiileeeeyyyy, is that you?*” He felt dry crumbles break under his feet, then a thin, wet slippery layer that nearly threw him down onto the soft wet grass below him. When did he get outside? He trailed deeper into the hallway, passing the door to the laundry again and again. Mud rubbed into his feet, entering him and hardening. *Inside you, I am inside you.* In between slipping around and landing on the drywall, he almost said, “Kitty, did you leave the lazy suzan on again?” He didn't know it was called a banding wheel until after she died. She’d only done so once, but the rotational force of the small mass of clay on the wheel she had left on flung into a bucket of water, spilling across the floor, seeping mud into the cracks in the floorboards.



The chill of the night air lapped at his face like a whip. He’d been walking down this hall for so long that he wasn’t sure of where he was anymore. He fell to his knees, screaming at the sky, “I’M SORRY, OKAY? PLEASE LET ME FIX IT. LET ME FIX IT”. Silence. “I DIDN’T MEAN IT, OKAY? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.” Silence. His jeans became cold and wet at the knees again, sinking into the mulch. Tears streamed down his face. Was it raining? He couldn’t be sure. It had been a rainy week. At least, he thought so. Is it still November? Are you blowing out your candles in heaven, Kitty? Is James Dean trying to take you to bed? Can it really be heaven without me? “Let me fix it. Please, God, please let me fix it.” Silence. And then a whisper. 



*Inside you. I am inside you.* Wiley reached into the pocket of his shitty windbreaker as it spurted blood. He reached past the epidermis, slipping through the palmar fascia. It was warm, much warmer than his shitty jacket had ever been before. He forced his fingers past the palmar flexor sheath, paying no mind to the way the tendons contorted around his fingers. His claw traveled downwards, ripping the thick layer of skin that separated the two gashes. They traveled into the wrist, and he pulled, trying to find every shard of porcelain left inside of him. He widened the slit with his fingers, exposing the small, pumping red and blue tubes in his arm. He ripped them free, letting his warm blood sink into the earth. The stone in front of him was too weathered to read. He licked the dirt out of each beveled letter. He felt he was losing too much blood and grabbed at the loose mulch on the surface of the empty plot, stuffing it under his skin. “See, you’re inside me! Does that make you happy? Do I still make you happy?” Silence. His stiff, half-curved fist was the perfect gardening shovel for him to dig himself deeper into the ground. Once he had dug past the snail shells and earthworms, into the rock below, he lay down in bed naked again, sobbing. 

“See, I’m inside you too?” 

Silence. It wasn’t supposed to come out as a question. 

“Can I still make you happy, Kitty?”

Silence. 

“Please let me fix it. I didn’t mean it. It was an accident.”

Silence. Then the whine of the banding wheel.

“I didn’t mean it, Kitty. I’m sorry, please let me fix it.”

Silence. 

Wiley screamed until he couldn’t anymore, then whispered until his voice box gave out, left to chew on silent words, the dry clack of his tongue separating from the roof of his mouth, only to slap it again. Inside you, I’m inside you again, Kitty. Does this make you happy, Kitty? Did I make you happy?

Silence. 

I could have done so much better, Kitty. Please let me fix it.

Silence. 

Please let me fix it, Kitty. I take it all back.

Silence. 

As Wiley felt his vision blur, he let his eyes close. Happy Birthday, Kitty. I’m coming back for you. 

Silence. 

Wiley felt his face grow cold, and his body stopped fighting as he clutched his windbreaker so close that its zipper broke his skin. He covered his face with it and took a deep sniff; it still smelled like patchouli.",1,1763415665.0,u_fangs444,0,1.0,False

Best deal I could find was a Samsung for $250 at Target. 

I watched it a little yesterday. I'm having my coffee watching YouTube today.  Screen keeps blacking out for a second.  Does this 15 times in an hour.

So I go to return it.

I already know if I get a new one of the same model it will just do it again.  But I try to do just that.

Store doesn't have any left of that model.

I asked could I exchange it.  They said yes

So I go find an LG for $40 more.  Told the guy I wanted that.

Went back to the refund guy. He says, ""Oh no, you can't exchange for a different product.  We can only do a refund (which takes 3 days to register).""  

So I say fine... refund me. Give me the other TV.  I have to go back to the sales guy (someone tried to sell me a cell phone in the middle of all this). Sales guys says... oh, we don’t have any of those.  I said what about the smaller one?  ""We don't have any of those either.""

Finally I had to go home and order an LG from the LG website. Which will take at least 2 days to get here... and will probably be stolen from in front of my building.

I'm going to be spending the next year paying off my credit card.  I have to work part time to do it and I'm disabled. It always fucking something. Part of the reason I'm in credit card debt is cause my 2 year old computer broke for no reason. Fixing the power supply would have cost more than it was worth.  While doing part time work Im a delivery driver and have to get twice as many oil changes and the starter mechanism broke from always having to turn the car off and on.

It's always fucking something.

Plus I had to get new tires.

Next something else will break.  You can never get ahead. Can't even get out of debt.

And because I'm disabled the government literally takes half the money I make working.  Otherwise I'd be able to pay off my debt in 3 months.  Instead of 8.",1,1763415625.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

Several batches in and I’m getting close to the flavor I like, but the problem remains that the brine itself is cloudy and does not look appetizing in the drink. 

I passed my blended brine solution through a cheese cloth and a very fine mesh strainer, but fine particulates remain. When I try to strain it through a coffee filter, I get nice clear brine, but one drip every two minutes, a.k.a. basically too slow to produce anything meaningful.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most statistically inevitable yet emotionally charged World Cup qualifier since a rock band tried to cover *Bohemian Rhapsody* in a karaoke bar. Austria and Bosnia-Herzegovina clash in Vienna on Tuesday, November 18, 2025, with Austria needing only a draw to clinch direct qualification to the 2026 World Cup. Bosnia? They must win—or join the playoff queue, where dreams go to die. Let’s dissect this like a Viennese pastry chef with a spreadsheet.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Austria’s Implied Probability Feels Like a Tax Audit

The bookmakers are as united as a chorus of bagpipes here. Austria’s odds range from **1.32 (BetRivers)** to **1.40 (DraftKings)**, translating to an implied probability of **74-77%**. For context, that’s the same confidence level as assuming your neighbor’s cat will eventually stop knocking over your potted plants. Bosnia, meanwhile, sits at **8.0 to 9.0**, implying a **11-13% chance**—about the same odds as betting your local coffee shop will start serving decaf espresso by next Tuesday. The draw? A modest **4.7-4.9 (20-21%)**, which feels like the sportsbook’s polite way of saying, “Don’t waste your money on this.”

Austria’s dominance isn’t just about numbers. They’ve lost just once in qualifiers (1-0 to Romania) and recently thumped Cyprus 2-0. Bosnia’s only blemish? That 2-1 home loss to Austria in their last meeting. If this were a Netflix series, Austria would be the protagonist with a “win or nothing” subplot, while Bosnia is the underdog character who accidentally ordered a “must-win or your dog gets adopted” script.

### Digesting the News: Austria’s “Open Book” Exam vs. Bosnia’s “All-or-Nothing” Gamble

Austria’s strategy is as simple as a kindergarten math test: show up, don’t gift Bosnia a hat trick, and maybe sneak a goal or two. Their players are likely treating this like a final exam where the professor whispers, “Just don’t fail.” With home advantage at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion—where the crowd’s roar could wake the dead—they’re primed to milk ev

My biological parents separated when I was 1, and my father went abroad and never came home to us again. Wala na kaming contact sa kanya growing up. Eventually, my mom had to process my adoption so I could legally become my grandparents’ child — sila na talaga ang family ko.

I always found it odd how my father was able to remarry kahit hindi pa sila annulled ni mama, but I never questioned it. We didn’t even meet during the adoption signing. We just went to their house, left the papers, and picked them up once he had signed. That was it.

We only saw each other again when I was around 17 or 18. After that, minsan nagbibigay siya ng extra allowance for college, and then nothing. I moved abroad. Paminsan-minsan nagmemessage siya, mostly small talk… until the last time he reached out, asking for money dahil may atraso daw siya. I didn’t help. Kasi bakit? He didn’t support me. He wasn’t there. He was absent in everything.

Recently, I learned he passed away last April 2025. I was even home last April — and if only I had known, I would’ve at least paid my respects. Kahit nung nailibing na siya. I didn’t want drama or anything. I just wanted… something. A moment.

I messaged a cousin from his side when I found out, but I never got a reply. I just remembered recently because I was scrolling through old chats. I don’t know why that hit me a little — parang kahit yung attempt ko to reach out, wala rin.

Then last night, I dreamt of him. We were in a garden. We were drinking coffee. I don’t remember everything I said, but I know I was telling him I wanted to talk to his family about something. And he looked at me, calm and gentle, and said:

*“Huwag na, anak. Wala silang alam.”*

The dream felt so real. When I woke up, my chest felt lighter… but may kurot pa rin. That weird mix of relief and a small ache you can’t describe.

And now I’m wondering:  
Is this the closure I’ve been wanting all these years?  
Or is it just my mind filling in the silence he left behind?

I don’t know. But it felt like something I needed to let out.",7,1763415326.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Everything was so expensive (waters for $9) but there was a lot of space at the venue and it wasn’t stuffy or overcrowded. People were nice and it was so cool to be able to talk with people who care about the same shows you do and just get it!!! Also these girls were handing out cards for this app they are starting ""Streamee"" where you can keep track of your shows, what you're watching, friends/family are watching, and get a full cumulative feed of all the Tik Toks, tweets, Instagram posts, etc. about the shows you're watching. I think they said they were doing a beta version in January (?) Not totally sure but seems like it would be fun. It was also so amazing to see everyone's outfits and everything. Just overall a very cool experience and met such great people!!!!!

Anyway here is a mumble jumble of random moments that stood out from RHOM!

* Panel was a shit show it got really awkward.
* Adrianna was trying very hard to have a moment.
   * She brought out the coffee machine she claims Julia bought for the Haitian Mortician.
   * She tried to expose the Haitian mortician by calling a fan to the stage who found a picture of him. The fan either wasn’t there or just didn’t come up to the stage and then Adrianna left the stage and came back saying it was Phaedra who was the mortician (?)
   * During this Julia was awkwardly standing there. It was especially painful bc they had apparently made up?
* Julia was asked to sing opera about something and everyone booed.
* Alexia said she only broke no contact with Todd when she ran into him somewhere and that they are not together.
* Kiki said she would love a mojito but isn’t pressed about not having one.
* Larsa was asked which Kardashian she thinks would be the best fit to join and she said Kim because she’s so business-saavy and so are the women on RHOM…?
* Stephanie was asked how Kris Jenner's bday party was and she was gushing about it.
* They applauded Guerdy to commemorate when she announced she was cancer free at Bravocon two years ago <3.
* Lisa and Larsa are good-- Larsa said she feels protective over Lisa like she can talk shit about Lisa but if others try to then she stops it.

(Yes, including the hot dog challenge, that was amusing! Gross, but amusing!)
But, my one question is: Why did you have to do us dirty like that, Kyle?! That ending though!
I knew, from the ""coffee date"" that we wouldn't have time in this one book to cover ALL of the new event, and prepare for what's to come, but I did not expect it to end quite so suddenly!
If this were Goodreads, I'd say this does get a 5 star review (since there's nothing between the numbers.) This was a very nice return to a world I've missed since the conclusion of Emperor's End!
My only low point is that I read through the book so quickly, that now I'm going to have to wait so long for the next, haha! But, that just means the happiness for the next installment will just rekindle, like it did here!
Thank you, Kyle, for a world that just keeps getting better and better!
And thank you for the solid 4 minutes of audiobook time that got me giggling so much! (I'm talking, of course, about chapter 9.)
I can say, with absolute certainty, that this was amazing! I love the new content in EBO, and how it was introduced. The intro to the event (our introduction to the Lunar Empress) was great! It felt so game-like and so accurate! It was perfectly put together!
This series definitely feels like an MMO, in book form, and I am NOT complaining about that! I've always felt a little left out of that scene, in part because of the multiplayer features, and how much is required of it in MMO's (multiplayer is in the name after all...) and how FEW MMO's are actually accessible to the blind community.

People have cars here, people have time on Sunday to go on a great ride but no groups to enjoy with. I wanna start some sort of car meets in Kanpur and put the car culture of Kanpur at par with other cities.

A simple, fun car community where we meet up, talk rides, grab coffee, maybe even plan drives or events. Itne sare destinations there can be at Kanpur like highway runs till Deepu Chauhan and stuff

\- 3 tbsp ground cinnamon

\- 1 tbsp ground cardamom

\- 1 tbsp ground ginger

\- 1/2 tbsp ground allspice

\- 1/2 tbsp ground cloves

Mix everything together in a jar and store with your coffee stuff.

Pelvic ultrasound confirmed I had cysts on my ovaries and blood test confirmed I had elevated testosterone. My main symptoms with PCOS are irregular/absent periods, chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, and facial hair growth. I REALLY REALLY believe I have adrenal PCOS but there’s no way to confirm that… that I know of? 

Anyways, I’ve read the books, articles, scoured through Reddit, talked to doctors, even some naturopaths and I feel like I have somewhat of an understanding of what I should be doing but I still struggle with consistent periods, being tired all the time, and crazy bouts of depression (especially when I am about to get a period). 

2 years (obviously I am not perfect but I am consistent) - I aim for 20-30 grams of protein every meal, avoid gluten, dairy, processed food, alcohol, caffeine on an empty stomach. I take myo and d chiro inositol as well as vitamin d and I drink spearmint tea 2 times a day. I get in at least 30 minutes of exercise 3 times a week as well as at least 8 hours of sleep every night. My water intake is great. THIS IS WHY IM UPSET. I feel like I do everything I’m supposed to, then I see these people who wake up and smoke cigarettes and drink coffee just menstruate and live their lives carefree. I am so unbelievably jealous, I feel like taking care of myself like this is a full time job and it’s EXPENSIVE. All the supplements I have to buy and healthy food every month is absurd. There’s been months in a row where everything is going well and then months where everything is not going well, I just need consistency.

I’m looking for anything that helps me get a regular period, have more energy, and improves my overall mood. I’ll try literally anything once. I would love if suggestions were budget friendly but if you have something you consider to be your holy grail I’ll hear you out.

I have always been my moms least favorite child. I have two brothers, the youngest being her favorite but she will always claim that's not true.

This story can stretch back to my first brother being born but I'll start from graduation since there's too much I can go on about and my graduation 'trip' was the moment I realized my mom genuinely doesn't like me.

There was a class cruise, funded by the school, I wanted to go on with my friends and my mom convinced me to skip it so we could go on one just me and her. I said that sounds great and agreed. Then she asked if my brothers could come and i said why not. Then she said ""well, your youngest brother wouldn't have fun on a cruise so pick somewhere else"" and we had a small argument but since she was paying for it, i couldn't do anything. Every place I suggested she shot down, from national parks to going indoor rock climbing at the nearest city. Instead she said ""We're going to Miami beach for your graduation."" Everyone was having a terrible time because we drove 14 hours non stop in a cramped vehicle (both my brothers are over 6ft and we're all in the back together). She planned one activity, and to be fair it was fun, but that left 2 days of kind of doing nothing. When i suggested we do something I liked she said ""this is a family trip! This isn't about you!"" and that was the last 'oh. she actually doesn't like me' moment it took to realize it. All that to stay there 2 nights before heading home and she never mentioned it again.

Not to mention, any accomplishment I have, she's already done it better.  
Like when I graduated she said ""I graduated with college credits"" like ok??? You also took away my adhd meds (from 5th onwards) so my grads flopped! (She ""didn't like"" how calm I was on the meds).

There was a couple years I had no contact with her after I moved out because she kept cutting off my phone every time I missed a call from her even if I was in class or work. (college) so I went many months using wifi. She would turn it back off it she was in a good mood then drop me again if I missed a call or if she thought I was giving her attitude.

(college) so I went many months using wifi. She would turn it back off it she was in a good mood then drop me again if I missed a call or if she thought I was giving her attitude.

Recently when she promised to get me a wedding dress.

She chose the place we should go to and then had me book the app (150 cancellation fee. money I don't have) so I made her promise she wouldn't cancel on me. She said ""Why would i?"" So I made the app. I told her about it... She then cancelled on coming to the app to take my brothers kids trick or treating (she could have made both. the app was at noon and trick or treating was at 4.) I had to go anyway. No one else could come (lucky my fiancé could) but I was already near tears. I can't really explain why, I knew she would cancel. I just, idk, thought she might actually care for once and to be cancelled on for trick or treating really hurt. So I show up to the app, I give them the budget my mom gave me and I find the perfect dress. I love it so much, my fiancé loved it, I sent pics to my bestie who loved it.

So I show the dress to my mom. She hates it and refuses to buy it because she ""doesn't like it"" (mind you, its in budget). I tell her that I really love the dress and I'm willing to pay for half if she keeps her half her promise and pays for half. She says ""I'm not ready to commit to a dress I don't like. How about we order something online?""

I did end up crying on the way out. I don't know why. I just expected more from her and this really was the last 'i can't trust her' moment. I'm still tearing up a bit over it.

My fiancé's grandma made me hot coco while I cried and his mom ended up buying me a wedding dress.

She hasn't texted or called since because she ""feels bad"". I only know this from my gma, who is asking me 'to be the better person' and I need to be 'more understanding'. (The same gma who tells me to just ignore the drunk call from my mother instead of blocking her). (for reference, I get about 1-4 calls a month where she just screams at me for 'not being so sweet and loving' like I was when I was 5.)

No matter what I try to do, like set up a coffee date or literally anything with my mom, she will cancel.

Of course she ""doesn't remember"" any of it or always has her go to excuse ""it was difficult raising you kids! (and i still managed to get my degree!)"" Naturally, every excuse she has must be followed by a self compliment.

She used to make me feel so angry because I couldn't understand why she couldn't love me the same as my brothers. But now I just feel kinda empty when I think of her. I don't have too strong emotions about her and I'm tired of her making me feel like shit.

I told my dad about it (they're divorced) and he just says ""she's still your mom and you should respect her even if you don't like her"".

I'm not sure what to do.

1ozswb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1ozswb6/places_i_stayed_and_my_reviews/,Places I stayed and my reviews.,"My budget was <$150 per night, and my non-negotiables were private rooms and parking on-site. This is what I chose. These basically all cost me between 120 and 130 USD and were booked through booking dot com.

1. Hotel Fron (Reykjavik)
4.9/5

Located right on Laugavegur, so easy to just walk out the front door and be an extremely short walking distance to anything you’d want to see. Room was a good size by Iceland standards, full size bed, had a really nice private bathroom in the room which was a huge plus, coffee maker in room, and also breakfast was included, though I didn’t really eat it because the Icelandic breakfasts at hotels are a bit odd to an American palate.. lots of cold lunch meats and cheese slices. Still nice to have though. Room was modern and cute, as was the whole hotel. My window looked right out onto Laugavegur. There was bar noise at night but it didn’t bother me as I’m a heavy sleeper. They have an elevator. They also have about 10 parking spots in the back that you can reserve which is huge considering the location of the hotel. Cost about ~30USD for the space which I thought was worth it for the convenience of knowing I could just drive up and park. However, they have a lift gate that you can’t get open until after you check in to access the parking lot, so I had to leave my car at the gate and run in to the lobby to have them open it. The guy at the desk said I was supposed to go find other parking, then come in and get access to my paid parking, which I thought was bizarre. They should probably install a buzzer or something so they can just let you in lol. But that was the only even minor issue. Front desk is staffed 24 hours and were friendly and helpful. Would gladly stay again! As a bonus there is also a 24 hour market directly next door if you need late night snacks, supplies or drinks, which I did! I woke up with a pit in my stomach and got a sandwich at 3am lol 

2. Paradise Cave Hostel (Hvolsvollur)
3/5

Chose a private room with shared bathroom. This was probably the barest room I had. Just a twin bed, night table and a lamp. But that really wasn’t any kind of issue. Iceland is about the sights, not the amenities. Shared bathrooms were big and clean (though you do have to walk through the dining area to access the showers). common dining and seating areas were incredibly cozy and homey. They had reggae and jazz playing, it was warm and there is cool artwork all over the walls, and a great view. Immaculate vibes. They had free coffee, tea and water available for all guests. Meals were available but not included. The location was perfect, a 2 minute drive from Seljalandsfoss, and the property itself is right up against a beautiful cliffside and there were sheep roaming the property. Nice views out my window. More than enough free parking spaces. 

The major issue here was the front door. This might have been a temporary issue they have since fixed, but the main door was extremely hard to open from either side. It’s like a “you have to really jiggle the handle, lift and pull simultaneously in the perfect way” kind of situation. Doesn’t sound like a big deal- but it was legitimately very hard to open sometimes and the staff would have to let me in or out at times. And if no one was at the desk, I’d have to noisily jiggle the handle like crazy to get out which would have been very disturbing to sleeping guests. I had to really weigh the cost/benefit of entering and exiting, especially because I wasn’t always sure I’d be able to get back in. Seems like an urgent problem and I hope they have fixed it!

I talked to 2 staff members here and one was absolutely delightful, and the other was honestly incredibly rude to me. I would stay here again though, and would still recommend it. The pros far outweighed the cons. 

3. Hofn HI Hostel (Hofn)
4/5

Booked a private room with private bathroom. They had laundry facilities which was great, but it was quite expensive (20ish dollars a load) and you needed the desk attendant to be able to use it, and they leave at I think 8pm. So def get your laundry done before then if you need it done. Good size room, nice bathroom, great location. No breakfast included. Had plenty of free parking available right out front. 

4. Guesthouse Carina (Vik)
4/5

Private room with shared bathroom. No breakfast, lots of free parking. 

This place probably has the best aesthetics and common dining area of anywhere I stayed. It was a huge selling point. It’s a huge, floor to ceiling glass dining room with comfy chairs and it’s nicely decorated, and has a nearly 360 degree view of the church, the village and the sea. Absolutely loved sitting there and just looking at the view. Staff was very friendly. 
Facilities were clean. The particular room I booked was the smallest one I stayed in… a twin bed with basically a foot of space around it on either side. I would say it felt a little claustrophobic. I did get a glimpse of some of the other more expensive rooms though and there are def some bigger ones available. The breakfast they were setting up looked pretty good so this is one place where I’d say it’s maybe worth paying for the meal. But I went to Skool Beans anyway, so. Heads up that they have a couple floors and no elevator so if you have mobility issues be aware. You have to carry your stuff up the stairs.

And honestly just a side note that Vik is so damn charming. I could see really being happy living there. It’s so cozy and lovely! I’m glad I chose to stay right in the central area of the village. I def wouldn’t skip it. 

5. Guesthouse Sunna (Reykjavik)
4/5

Private room (relatively spacious, with a great view of Hallgrimskirkja), shared bathrooms, no breakfast included. Very cute modern place and the location is 10/10, steps from Hallgrimskirkja and right next to Cafe Loki. Limited kitchen facilities, I wouldn’t plan to cook a full meal here, though why you’d want to in Reykjavik with all that food right there I don’t know. Plenty of free parking right outside, plus an additional lot behind, which is invaluable.

I would have given this place 5/5, but this was the only place I stayed that didn’t have hairdryers in the bathrooms or any in the room. This was my last night and I really wanted to take a full shower and wash and dry my hair this night, and I couldn’t. Which really sucked. They do have a couple hair dryers, but they are kept behind the front desk which is not staffed 24 hours, or even very late. I think they’re done at 7. Maybe they don’t want hair dryer noise at night, but quiet hours weren’t until 10 so that doesn’t make sense. They had other amenities like irons etc where you could just grab from the hallway, I’m not sure why they don’t have hairdryers there too. It kind of threw a wrench into my plans because I had to wait until the desk attendant arrived in the morning to get one, and I wasn’t even sure they had any until then…and then wash my hair, and I was really hoping to get an earlier start to the day. I feel like hair dryers are a standard amenity pretty much everywhere so this was an inconvenience for sure. It wasn’t the end of the world though as it forced me to sleep in a little which I needed. 

Also no elevator here so keep in mind if carrying things up the stairs is an issue for u. 

The employees were lovely here and gave me recommendations and directions for food I wanted.

It was built earlier this year so no one has lived in the unit before. Base rent is $2.8k with single parking spaces available (150 each). However, there’s actually an abundant street parking right outside the building (except thursday mornings for street cleaning) so parking fee is definitely optional. I should also mention that they are willing to work something out to bring the parking fee down or provide a concession if our application looks good. Also, comes with in unit W/D. I'm looking to move late November between Nov. 25th - Dec. 1st.

I'm hoping to find a potential roommate who is in their mid-late 20s/early 30s, working professional, chill, tidy, respectful, and easy to live with. someone who's LGBTQ+ friendly. No pets on my end, but I'm definitely open to my roommate having one as long as they're friendly :)

A little about me: I'm 27M, filipino-american and work as a financial analyst for a retail company. Outside of work I'm into fitness, cooking, checking out different coffee shops and restaurants, traveling, going to shows/ concerts and festivals, and just exploring the city. I also love making the apt feel homey so i like keeping my space and the common areas neat and clean. I like going out but i'm also a bit of a homebody so I don't mind staying in every now and then.

Feel free to dm me on ig if you prefer to chat there! (message me for handle and if you’d like to see the pics). Also, the subreddit doesn’t allow me to post pics/vid so i attached a youtube link for when i toured the apt.

Everyone’s acting like we just watched our Super Bowl dreams get murdered in front of us, when literally most had this team not winning the Lombardi in 2025.

I had us pegged at 11-6 from jump street. That’s… literally where we’re headed if we don’t completely implode. But apparently that’s “unacceptable” now because some of y’all convinced yourselves we were the 2007 Patriots in disguise.

Newsflash: the window didn’t slam shut—it was never even cracked open this year. We took one tiny step backward on purpose so we could take two giant leaps forward next year. Easier schedule, rookies who’ll actually know where the locker room is, veterans who’ll remember how to tackle… you know, basic improvement stuff.

And can we talk about the schedule for a second? It’s been brutal—like “facing the entire NFC East on steroids” brutal. We were never beating the Eagles. Most of us said that out loud before the game.  If you’d asked me before the season, “Hey, after the Eagles game, where’s the team at?” I would’ve said 6-4 without hesitation. That’s exactly where we are. Chill. 11-6 is not a war crime. It’s not like we went 15-2 last year and suddenly forgot how to play football. We’re fine. Take a breath, touch grass, and save the meltdowns for when we actually deserve them.

If your insulin feels all over the place, I want to share what finally helped me get a sense of stability: OMAD (one meal a day).

I’m not pitching anything. I’m not saying this is a magic fix. I’m just telling you what shifted for me—maybe it’ll click for someone else too.

# Why I Think My Insulin Was Spiking So Much

For me, it wasn’t the big meals that caused trouble—it was the constant little things.  
A bite while cooking. A snack at my desk. A “quick something” from the vending machine.  
I barely noticed them, but my body did. Each little spark kept my insulin bouncing up and down.

And when you mix that with poor sleep, weird work hours, or stress?  
Everything gets worse.

# What OMAD Changed Immediately

Putting nearly my entire day into a “fasting zone” gave my system space to chill out for the first time in ages. The wild swings started calming down once I wasn’t eating every couple of hours.

With just one predictable meal:

* I had one clear glucose rise
* one clear fall
* and none of the constant mini-spikes

My appetite felt quieter. My head felt clearer.  
The cravings didn’t vanish overnight, but they lost their bite.

# What I Actually Eat in My OMAD Meal (This Part Mattered)

I had to learn this the hard way: the single meal needs a balance or it backfires.

What helped me:

* **protein as the foundation** (eggs, chicken, fish, tofu… anything steady)
* **a large serving of vegetables** for fiber and fullness
* **carbs that don’t blow up my glucose** (potatoes, fruit, oats, quinoa)
* **a little fat** so I don’t get hungry halfway through the next day

I used to pack the meal with sugary stuff because “hey, it’s one meal,” and the crashes were brutal. Balance matters more than size.

# Small Habits That Made the Biggest Difference

* **Water + electrolytes during the fast** I kept blaming insulin when I was actually just dehydrated.
* **A short walk after my OMAD meal** It made a very noticeable difference in how stable I felt.
* **Eating around the same time daily** Sounds simple, but consistency helped regulate everything.

# Who OMAD Seemed to Help the Most (Based on What I’ve Seen)

* People who snack out of stress
* People whose afternoons feel like a downhill slide
* People who hate thinking about food all day
* People who get cravings like clockwork

If your eating pattern feels chaotic, OMAD creates a clean line through the noise.

# Mistakes I Made That Totally Messed With My Blood Sugar

* **Turning OMAD into a “cheat-day buffet”** One huge sugar-heavy meal makes insulin freak out.
* **Too little protein** This made my hunger unstable.
* **Ignoring hydration** Again—way more connected than I expected.

# How I Knew OMAD Was Actually Helping

* I stopped getting those sudden “I need food NOW” urges
* My mid-afternoon slump faded
* Hunger felt more predictable, not random or urgent
* My mood leveled out instead of tanking after meals

The change was subtle at first, then really obvious after a few weeks.

# A Few Questions I Asked Myself (And the Answers I Found)

**“Is OMAD even okay if I’m worried about blood sugar?”**  
It helped me a lot, but if you’re on meds or have medical stuff going on, definitely check in with a doctor.

**“Why did I feel weird the first few days?”**  
My electrolytes were off and I wasn’t eating enough protein. Fixing those fixed the feeling.

**“Can I have coffee while fasting?”**  
I drink plain coffee and it’s never caused problems.

**“Do I need some giant meal to survive the fast?”**  
Nope. Balanced beats oversized every time.

**“Does it help with belly fat?”**  
Once my insulin calmed down, things changed around my waist pretty quickly.

# Stuff That Helped Me Along the Way (Not sponsored, just real life)

* electrolyte packets
* cheap glucose monitor
* walking shoes
* protein-rich staples for quick OMAD meals
* a decent water bottle I actually remembered to carry 

If anyone wants me to break down my exact OMAD meal, my fasting schedule, or how I handled cravings, I can share that too.

1ozss18,https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/1ozss18/advertising_is_dead/,Advertising is dead,"# The AI Layer That Kills Advertising (And Makes Shopping Actually Good)

**TL;DR:** An AI sits between you and your OS/apps, learns your patterns, blocks/removes all forced ads, shows you product info only when YOU want it, manages your budget, and eventually uses AR to remove billboards from reality. This could actually exist right now.

---

## The Core Concept

Imagine three layers:

**Layer 1:** Your normal OS - unchanged, always accessible

**Layer 2:** Personal AI that:
- Observes how you work (with permission)
- Reads software documentation for you
- Learns your patterns and preferences
- Blocks all advertising unless you want it
- Manages your finances

**Layer 3:** Optimized interface generated nightly
- Only shows what YOU use
- Personalized to your workflow
- Gets smarter every day

You can switch between layers anytime. Full transparency.

---

## How Advertising Actually Dies

### The Ad-Blocking Evolution

Your AI controls the interface layer. When companies try to show ads:

**Display ads?** Removed before you see them.

**YouTube sponsors?** AI detects and skips them automatically (computer vision + audio analysis).

**Podcast ad reads?** Stripped out in real-time.

**News desk with corporate logos?** Digitally removed from the video feed.

**You control what reaches your consciousness.** There's no technical way around this.

Companies can't force ads when AI mediates the interface. Period.

### What Replaces Advertising

**The Christmas Catalog Protocol**

Instead of ""ads,"" companies publish structured product catalogs (like RSS feeds but for products):

```
Nike Product Catalog:
- Product name, features, prices
- Educational videos (3min overview, 5min technical deep-dive)
- Honest comparisons vs competitors
- Reviews from verified purchases
- Availability, warranty, sustainability info
```

Every company publishes in a standard format. Every AI can read them all.

### How You Actually Shop

```
You: ""I need running shoes""

AI: 
1. Reads all shoe company catalogs (Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc.)
2. Filters by your size, budget, preferences
3. Cross-references with Consumer Reports, independent reviews
4. Ranks by objective quality metrics

AI: ""Here are the top 3 matches for YOU:
     [Shows actual best options, not who paid most]""

You: ""Tell me about option 1""

AI: ""Here's why it matches your needs... [relevant info]
     Want the detailed video? You'll get $15 gift card.""

You: ""Yes""

You watch educational content, make informed decision, get discount.
```

**No manipulation. No interruption. Just information when you want it.**

### The Gift Card Solution

Here's how ads can survive ethically:

""Watch 3 Nike videos → Get $15 Nike gift card""

**Why this works:**
- Only people interested in Nike will opt in (self-selection)
- Gift card only valuable if you were buying anyway
- No point having AI auto-watch (you don't want the product)
- Companies get qualified prospects, users get discounts
- Honest value exchange

**The AI's role:**
- Tracks which deals match your interests
- ""You mentioned wanting running shoes. Nike has an offer. Interested?""
- Manages your rewards
- Prevents exploitation (""This deal is $0.50 per ad, that's too low"")

### Budget Integration

Tell your AI: ""My discretionary budget is $200/month""

Now it becomes your financial guardian:

```
You: ""I want those $150 shoes""

AI: ""You have $80 left this month.
     Options:
     1. Wait 13 days (budget resets)
     2. These similar shoes are $85 (also highly rated)
     3. Budget from next month (but you'll start short)
     
     Also: you mentioned wanting concert tickets ($80).
     If you buy shoes now, you can't afford the concert.
     Which matters more?""
```

**Your AI protects you from yourself.**

It won't show you products you can't afford (unless you want to see them). It makes the cost of debt visible. It helps you save for goals.

---

## Pull vs Push: How You Discover New Things

**PULL (what you know you want):**
""Show me running shoes"" → AI queries catalogs, presents best matches

**PUSH (innovations you don't know exist):**

AI observes your struggles and proactively suggests solutions:

```
AI notices: You manually resize images before emailing (every time)
AI discovers: Batch image tools exist
AI suggests: ""There's a tool that does this instantly. Want to see?""
```

Or:

```
You: ""I'm open to discovering new stuff""

AI: ""Here are innovations in categories you care about:
     - New coffee brewing method (you love coffee)
     - E-ink tablet (you read a lot)
     - Standing desk converter (you mentioned back pain)""
```

**Push isn't gone. It's just:**
- Contextual (suggests when relevant)
- Respectful (can say ""not now"")
- Filtered by AI (actually matches your needs)
- Controllable (set how much you want)

Like having a friend who knows you well and occasionally says ""hey, you should check this out"" - and is usually right.

---

## The App Development Revolution

Eventually this changes how apps are built.

**Today:** Developer designs ONE interface for everyone. Feature bloat. Compromise that satisfies nobody.

**Tomorrow:** Developer ships minimal core functionality. Your AI observes how YOU use it. Regenerates the interface NIGHTLY to match your workflow.

**Example - Photoshop:**

**Current Photoshop:** 10,000 features, menus 8 levels deep, you use maybe 50

**AI-customized Photoshop:**
- Base: Core image engine
- Your AI observes: ""User only does photo retouching""
- Regenerates: Interface with ONLY your 50 features
- Arranged for YOUR workflow
- My Photoshop looks completely different from yours

**Apps become spartan cores.** Your AI generates the personalized interface.

This also solves accessibility automatically - the AI adapts to YOUR abilities without separate ""accessibility modes.""

---

## The AR Endgame: Billboards

Final step: AR glasses that remove billboards from your vision.

```
Walking down street
Billboard shows car ad
↓
Your AI processes visual feed
Detects: Advertisement
↓
Your choice:
- Blank it out
- Replace with art
- Replace with nature scene  
- Show catalog info IF you're shopping for cars
- Complete removal
```

**Times Square for you:** Calm buildings with art installations

**Times Square for tourists:** (They opted in to see ads for $50 credit)

**Same physical space. Different realities.**

When 30% of people wear AR glasses, billboard ROI collapses. When 60% wear them, the industry is dead.

**Your visual cortex becomes sovereign territory.** No more forced visual inputs.

---

## Why This Doesn't Exist Yet

**The technology is ready (as of 2024):**
- Computer vision models can understand UIs
- Local LLMs are fast enough
- Accessibility APIs exist for OS observation
- AR is emerging (Apple Vision Pro, etc.)

**Why nobody's built it:**

1. **Just became possible** - Computer use APIs are ~1 year old

2. **Threatens trillion-dollar industries** - Google, Meta, entire ad-tech stack

3. **Engineers overthink it** - ""What about edge cases?"" Just ship V1.

4. **Legal gray area** - ToS violations, but probably unenforceable

5. **Perfect is enemy of good** - Waiting for perfect system instead of useful V1

**But it's inevitable.** Once one person builds it, everyone will want it.

---

## Why This Is Better

**Dies:**
- Surveillance capitalism
- Attention harvesting
- Manipulative dark patterns
- Ad-supported misinformation
- Interruption-based advertising
- Consumer debt traps

**Survives/Emerges:**
- Products that are actually good
- Honest value exchange
- Direct payment for services
- Financial wellness
- Cognitive freedom
- Personalized computing

**Companies forced to compete on quality, not ad budget.**

Small businesses can compete (don't need ad scale). Consumers get objective information. Scams die (can't buy visibility).

**More honest. More fair. Higher quality.**

---

## The Open Source Requirement

This MUST be open source to be trustworthy.

**Why:**
- Auditable code (no hidden data collection)
- Community oversight (thousands checking for abuse)
- Local-first processing (privacy-preserved)
- You control your data (fork it, modify it)
- Transparent AI (see exactly what it does)

**Closed source version = creepy surveillance**

**Open source version = digital autonomy**

Users can verify:
- ""Does this send data anywhere?"" (No, it's local)
- ""What does it do with my location?"" (Here's the exact code)
- ""Can I turn off X feature?"" (Yes, delete that module)

---

## The Evolution

**GitHub has the base:** Core observation engine, AI integration, privacy protocols

**Your AI customizes it nightly:**
- Observes YOUR usage for 24 hours  
- Generates YOUR personalized fork
- Removes features you don't use
- Adds automations for YOUR patterns
- Adjusts privacy to YOUR comfort

**Week 1:** Generic assistant

**Month 1:** Knows your workflows

**Month 6:** Completely personalized computing environment

**Your version looks nothing like anyone else's.**

---

## Why You Should Build This

If you're a college student or engineer looking for a project:

**Portfolio impact:**
- ""I built an AI layer over the OS""
- Demo video would be absolutely killer
- Instant interview interest

**Perfect for:**
- Senior/capstone project
- Hackathon (48-hour MVP is viable)
- Open source project with real impact
- Possible startup

**Technical challenge is achievable:**
- Screen capture + computer vision
- Accessibility APIs for app detection  
- Local LLM integration
- Basic automation framework

**6-8 weeks to working prototype.**

**The idea that should already exist but doesn't.**

---

## The Philosophical Win

This isn't about blocking ads as punishment.

**It's about restoring honest information flow:**

- Pull vs Push (you request, not interrupted)
- Quality vs Budget (best product wins, not biggest advertiser)
- Transparency vs Manipulation (clear exchange, not dark patterns)
- User sovereignty vs Attention extraction

**Advertising becomes information again.**

When you need running shoes, Nike's product video IS valuable information. When you DON'T need shoes, it's worthless noise.

**The difference is context and consent.**

Your AI ensures: Right information, right time, right person, right incentive.

---

## This Is The Future

Not because it should be, but because:
- The capability exists
- Users will choose it
- Can't un-invent the technology  
- Economic incentives align

**Someone's going to build this in the next 12-18 months.**

Might as well be you.

She gave the right answers, stayed calm in storms she did not cause, and held the room together with jokes that cost her pieces of herself. In photos, she looked okay. In private, she felt like a glass that had been set down too hard and was now full of hairline cracks no one could see.

When she broke, it was not poetic. It was dishes left in the sink because lifting a cup was too much. It was unanswered messages and a phone face down for days. It was lying awake for hours with tears she could not stop. It was a whisper in the dark that felt heavier than a shout in the light. People told her to be strong. They meant well, but they did not see her knees. They did not see the way her chest tightened when someone said “You’re so resilient,” as if resilience was not built from a thousand small hurts she never had time to name.

She tried to bargain with herself. Maybe if she works harder. Maybe if she forgives faster. Maybe if she smiles wider. But the truth kept returning like a slow, kind bell: something inside her needed care, not performance. She did not need to earn rest. She needed to take it. In the quiet, she started to say honest words. I am tired. I am hurt. I am at my limit. She did not decorate those sentences to make others comfortable. She let them be plain and heavy, because plain and heavy was exact.

She stopped calling her boundaries “being difficult.” She stopped calling her needs “too much.” She stopped shrinking to fit rooms that fed on her silence. She learned that love without respect is a slow hunger that does not end. She remembered every time her body had warned her before her mind agreed. The faster heartbeat at the wrong touch. The sick feeling after an unfair apology. The way her hands shook when she said yes to something that was a no. She promised to believe these small alarms without asking them to show proof.

Healing did not look impressive from the outside. It was water before coffee. It was turning the key and going for a small drive with music low. It was washing her face and changing her sheets. It was canceling plans that asked her to betray herself again. She forgave the version of herself that stayed. Not because it was right, but because it was the best she knew then. She forgave the part of her that tried to make it work by working herself thin. Forgiveness did not excuse anyone. It simply let her put down what kept cutting into her hands.

Day by day, she practiced a new kind of strength. Not the kind that never cries. The kind that tells the truth and keeps going. The kind that chooses peace over proving a point. The kind that says no without guilt and yes without fear. She did not need to be hard to be safe. She needed to be clear. Some days she slipped. Old habits knocked. Old hopes whispered. On those days, she spoke to herself the way she had once hoped someone would speak to her—gently, with patience, with a steady belief that she could try again tomorrow. She did not start over from nothing. She started over from wisdom.

People noticed she smiled less for show and more for real. They noticed she replied slower, but with truth. They noticed she took up a little more space. She was not louder; she was rooted. She moved with a quiet steadiness that did not ask for permission. She no longer rushed to fill silence. She did not edit herself to be easier to hold. She let pauses be pauses and needs be needs. When guilt tried to climb back into her throat, she met it with truth: I am allowed to protect my peace.

She let some things end without writing a goodbye speech in her head. She did not chase what kept proving it did not know how to stay. She put energy where there was evidence. She learned that loss can be honest, and endings can be kind. Not every door has to slam to be closed. Little rituals became her anchors. A slow walk after rain. Clean sheets on a Tuesday. A cup held with both hands. Music that did not hurt. A text to someone safe that said, “Thinking of you.” She found that tenderness, practiced often, becomes its own kind of courage.

She learned to celebrate without an audience. A good night’s sleep counted. A “no” that held. A “yes” that felt like oxygen. Forgiving herself for how long it took to get here. She stopped apologizing for healing at a human pace. People adjusted or they left. The ones who stayed learned the new terms: respect first, honesty always, effort that matches. She did not beg anyone to understand the price she paid to stand here. She just stood—grounded, present, unhidden.

When old pain knocked, she did not invite it to move in. She opened the door, named it, and let it pass. She reminded herself, You are allowed to feel and still move forward. You are allowed to rest and still be strong. You are allowed to make a life that does not require you to disappear. She did not return to the girl who seemed unbreakable. She became the woman who knows she can survive what breaks her and still choose softness. She learned that love is not proof of worth; her breath is. Her quiet is. Her choosing herself is.

And so the story ends the way real healing does: not with a bang, but with a steady light inside her that does not flicker when the room grows cold. She heard herself say, “I can’t do this anymore,” and she listened. She set down what hurt, kept what healed, and walked on—gentle, honest, and sure. She is here, carrying herself day by day, and that is the most beautiful thing she has ever done.""

1ozs6g4,https://tipstor.io/contactless-payments-the-shift-to-cashless-transactions-in-hotels/,Contactless Payments: The Shift to Cashless Transactions in Hotels,"The front desk used to be where fights started and romances ended. Now it’s where wallets either breathe easy or choke. Contactless payments have elbowed their way into hotels like a new breed of concierge. Fast, invisible, and merciless about friction. Guests want to tap and go. Hotels that give them that pleasure see happier customers and cleaner operations. Oracle reports that more than 60% of hospitality executives expect fully contactless experiences, check-in, room keys, food and beverage, to become widespread in the next few years.

It’s easier to see why when the numbers are read aloud. Worldpay notes that contactless methods now account for roughly 43% of transactions in many markets, driven by NFC and mobile wallets that people already trust for coffee and cabs. That momentum turns the hotel’s in-house restaurant, minibar, and spa into conversion points instead of little headaches where cards decline and lines form. The Contactless Payment Market was valued at USD 53.29 billion in 2024 and is forecast to swell rapidly, making this a revenue play as much as a convenience play.

AI and lifecycle management glue the pieces together. Data from contactless POS, mobile keys, and app check-ins flows into a single brain that knows a guest’s behavior before the guest does. When mobile check-in usage climbs, the lifecycle engine nudges targeted offers, late checkout bundles, F&B credits, and spa upgrades, at the exact micro-moment when conversion likelihood spikes. Oracle’s hospitality report found that hotels offering mobile check-in see higher guest satisfaction and meaningful revenue lifts, and the algebra is cruelly simple. Reduced friction plus timely offers equals more ancillary spend.

Operational wins are concrete and fast. Contactless systems cut transaction times from minutes to seconds, clear lines, and free staff to sell real service instead of swapping payment terminals. Hotels piloting kiosks, mobile wallets, and in-app payments report decreases in front desk queues and a bump in upsells at arrival. One hospitality case documented by Marriott shows smart kiosks handling check-in and contactless checkout in under a minute, routing guests straight to room keys without the old ritual of lines and forms. That speed translates into higher Net Promoter Scores and a cleaner guest journey.

New trends are arriving like shouted orders in a busy kitchen. First, unified commerce. Hotels are collapsing POS, minibar, F&B, and e-commerce into a single payments fabric so that loyalty points, dynamic pricing, and promotions travel with the guest across touchpoints. Second, frictionless identity. Mobile keys, biometric check-ins, and tokenized payments mean the guest can arrive, charge a drink, and leave without touching plastic or speaking to a clerk. Third, smart revenue orchestration. AI models use lifecycle signals from contactless behavior to predict who will buy what, then time offers so perfectly they feel inevitable. That’s not personalization as marketing. It’s personalization as profit. Studies show hotels using predictive analytics see revenue and repeat bookings rise substantially when lifecycle tools are in place.

There are tactical headaches, tokenization policies, PCI compliance, and the ugly business of disputed charges, but those are engineering problems, not moral quandaries. The strategic payoff is clear. Lower labor costs, fewer disputes, higher guest spend, and a modern brand image. Hotels that ignore contactless payments find their lobbies full of impatient people who expect the same speed they get from their phones. Those who embrace the shift gain speed, data, and the right to sell more without shouting.

The market is moving fast and the playbook is straightforward. Stitch contactless payments into the guest lifecycle, feed that telemetry into AI to find the upsell moments, and optimize offers and operations around the signals. Guests get convenience. Hotels get predictable revenue and a cleaner operation. In an industry where margins are thin and expectations fat, contactless payments aren’t just an amenity. They’re the new ledger of competitive advantage.

1ozs5hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1ozs5hx/cant_even_recall_what_a_hot_meal_tastes_like/,Can't even recall what a hot meal tastes like,"I’m crying, shaking and trembling as I type this—never thought I’d be here. Three years ago my mum and only last surviving family member passed on. Her final bedside leftover lunch pumpkin soup was the last taste I have of a hot meal. Medical bills took everything and I eventually lost our last remaining house. For 1,095 days I haven’t had a hot meal. Not one. No stove, no microwave, no kitchen. If I'm lucky, I get peanut butter on crackers from the dumpster once a week. I dream of the smell of coffee, and my mum's chili simmering as we prepare her food orders… I woke up sobbing last night remembering our last hot bowl together, but I only had the rail tracks to keep warm.

I’ve applied to every kind of assistance to get myself back on my feet, set up my little shed, and pick up from my mum's last homemade food order before she collapsed and eventually passed on after a year. Her last words to me, “If you ever pick up my kitchen robe, donate one for every order you make.”

If I make it out of this, I’ll live by her wish until I go to be with her. And maybe, I'll get the family that I haven't had.

1ozs5dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ozs5dk/pemmican_for_ketocarnivore/,Pemmican for keto/carnivore?,"I've been thinking about pemmican bars for a keto/carnivore diet. They can unfortunately be fairly expensive. I found one that doesn't have any sugar - it's over 750 calories, has 40 grams of protein and 60 grams of fat. I can link it if anyone is interested.

Since I know it does matter, I'm 40m, 5'4"", and about 125 lbs. I lost about 5 lbs by pretty much eliminating sugar, and severely cutting down on carbs. I did lose about 15 lbs in the summer, but that was due to stress before cutting carbs and sugar.

I really don't have much money and really can't cook. I don't have a target weight, and am extremely physically weak, so much so that I avoid running as much as possible. Going up a few flights of stairs makes my thighs burn. Should I have double or triple that fat, protein and calories for a day? My diet is still pretty bad, but I've made good steps towards fixing it.

I still drink coffee, and not nearly enough water itself - I've found sugar free drinks, Zevia soda and Pellegrino sugar free drinks.

Looking for any advice on pemmican, as it seems like a solid choice as far as calories, fat and protein go.",5,1763413082.0,keto,5,1.0,False

I opened my eyes to see that dim fluorescent lights had replaced the gentle sunlight on Sandy’s porch. I noticed the taste of coffee on my tongue. The only coffee I had had in days came from Sandra.

“Hey there, look who’s awake.” Someone else was holding my hands instead of my new friend. It was a plump older nurse who had a look like she had not expected to be seen. “Sorry to bother you, sweetie. I was just adjusting your bedding. But looks like you’ll be going home soon.” I smiled confusedly at her. She scurried away to call the doctor.

I looked around, and my heart sank in my chest. I was back in the hospital. I had promised myself that I would never come back, and there I was. My memory flashed with the last sights I could recall before the Square: the heat of a blinding spotlight from the floor of the stage, Dotty and Senator Pruce’s faces hiding irritation, someone lifting me.

Searching my memory, I saw Bree’s frightened face above mine. She had carried me off the stage. She had had to carry me again—like she always did. I had let her down. She had given her life for the campaign, and I had killed it with my weakness. My failure. If anyone could save the campaign now, it was Bree. But I knew too much damage had been done. I laughed at myself with wry derision. I had wanted the campaign to end.

Before long, the nurse returned with a doctor who must have been near the end of his long career. His chipped nameplate read “P. Shelley.” While the nurse checked my vitals and helped me dress, Dr. Shelley told me what everyone in town already knew. Generalized anxiety disorder. Insomnia. And what only I had known. The struggle that hadn’t been presentable: extreme exhaustion, severe dehydration, dissociative symptoms, high blood alcohol levels. Dr. Shelley had me sign some forms I didn’t care to read and then continued on to his next patient. Watching Dr. Shelley walk away, I noticed that the linoleum floors were just the same as they were five years earlier. So was I.

The old nurse explained prescriptions to me and advised me against alcohol consumption with the patient exasperation of a high school guidance counselor. I nodded and waited for her to finish. Her warning was unnecessary. The taste of coffee had cleared the way for the taste of bile in my throat. After remembering the feeling of vomit pouring through my locked teeth with the entire county watching, I wasn’t going to drink again anytime soon.

The nurse walked me out to the lobby to retrieve my personal effects. I could hear a caller shouting at the receptionist through the landline. The receptionist gave me a friendly smile and handed over a large plastic bag with my watch, phone, and wallet. Taking out my things, I saw the visitor log through the bag’s clear plastic. A hospital this size normally didn’t have many visitors, but the same name was written for every day that week: Bree. My stomach twisted into a knot of guilt.

I turned on my phone out of habit. No one had called. Not even his parents. Relieved, I turned his phone back off. I wasn’t talking to anyone. The nurse helped me close the clasp of my watch. I didn’t need her to, but I appreciated her trying to help. “Thank you, Ms… I’m sorry I didn’t get your name.”

“Silvia,” she said. I gave her a familiar smile. “Thank you, Silvia. For everything.”

When I was almost out the waiting room door, Silvia called to me. “Hey sweetie…” She beckoned me back and lowered her voice to a whisper. Standing closer to her, I could smell cigarette smoke on her scrubs. “If you don’t mind me asking, what was that song you kept singing?”

“Um…I don’t remember. Was I singing? Sorry about that.”

“No, no. It’s okay. I was just curious. You kept singing to yourself while you were out. I thought I almost recognized the song. It was something like, *‘If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…*’” Silvia didn’t have any idea of what that song meant.

I intended to keep it that way. “I have no idea. Sorry.”

“Oh, it’s okay, hon. Now you go home and get some rest.” She gave me a kind squeeze on the arm.

I left the hospital with the sinking feeling that I would be back soon. I had thought I had handled my mental health—closed the file and checked the box for that part of my life. Apparently, it was a problem I would never solve. Walking to my car, I fought to keep the refrain of Sandy’s song—that song I had thought was a lullaby—from circling my mind.

I forgot it for a moment when I opened my car door and the heat almost knocked me out again. I should have remembered what a warm Mason County fall did to a locked car. When the song started up again, I turned on the radio. The station had been on public radio for years, but I turned it to the classic country station my mother played when I was a boy. One of her favorite songs was playing.

“Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side…”

Once I got to my apartment, I lost all sense of time. It didn’t matter anymore. I had left my laptop in my car and didn’t want to see all the emails from concerned clients asking about finding new representation. The campaign was over. My parents hadn’t called even after what they surely saw on the TV. And I certainly couldn’t talk to Bree—or even face her. Her disappointment would be unbearable. I badly wanted to drink. I was thankful that I couldn’t bring myself to go to the liquor store.

I couldn’t see the sun rise or fall through his curtains, but it felt like days passed. I just sat. Sometimes my mind showed him images of the local press reporting on my collapse and the campaign’s implosion. Sometimes I saw pictures of my parents going about their social lives as their associates conspicuously avoided my name in conversation. Most often, I saw Bree desperately holding the campaign together with prayers and press releases. I wished her the best. I couldn’t do it any more.

I heard a knock at the door. I ignored it. It was probably a canvasser for Pruce or one of the ballot initiatives. They would go away eventually.

The knock came again. I couldn’t move. I was sure whoever was out there had already judged me. I couldn’t do anything to impress them.

“Mikey,” the person at the door shouted. “I know you’re in there. You know I have a key…” It was Bree. She was angry. I thought about trying to hide before realizing how childish that would have been. I heard Bree’s key in the lock.

“Have you just been sitting here in the dark?” she scolded as she let herself in. “I’ve been trying to call you for the last thirty minutes. I went to the hospital, and they told me you had checked yourself out. What do you think—” She saw me sitting silently. She sat down her purse and sat beside me.

“I’m sorry,” I muttered.

“Hey, don’t worry about it.” She put her arm around my shoulders in an awkward attempt at warmth. “I was just scared when I couldn’t find you.”

“Thanks.”

“I’m just glad you’re alright.”

We sat in silence for a long moment. Neither of us had ever been taught how to handle this. We had been taught how to fight fear, how to power through pain. Never how to feel it.

“Mikey…” Bree said quietly. She was using all of her effort to form her emotions into words. “Um…”

With nothing left to prove, I hugged my sister. She hugged me back. In that instant, we didn’t need words.

“I’m sorry…” Bree continued as she instinctively held back her tears.

“It’s okay—”

“No, it’s not okay. Thank you, but no. I’m sorry for overworking you. I’m sorry for ignoring you when you tried to talk to me. I heard your words, but I didn’t listen for your feelings. I was scared to. I just tried to fix it. I thought that—all of *this* was what we were supposed to do.”

“I know. I did too.” We were sharing the same secret. “So, what happens to the campaign now? I’m sure you’ve been working overtime since I imploded.”

Bree caught the self-deprecation in my words. “Hey,” she said with protective anger. “Don’t say that. You didn’t implode. You let go. And I’m proud of you. The campaign doesn’t matter right now. You can decide what to do about it later.”

It felt like a weight was lifted from my lungs. I breathed freely for the first time I could remember.

“Michael, are you okay?” My name. The one my parents had given me when I was born. It had been years since I had heard it. Years since they decided “Mikey” would be more likable.

It was the question again. But it sounded different this time. Bree wasn’t asking it like she was expecting me to say my next line. She was asking to understand. To listen.

“I…” I wanted to meet my sister in her honesty. It took all of the little strength I had left to say the words I had to say. “I don’t know.”

In this unfamiliar vulnerability, I was afraid of what Bree would say. Saying I didn’t know was saying nothing. It didn’t give her anything to fix. It was only a confession.

“That’s okay.” Her voice told me I did not need forgiveness. “When you figure it out, I’ll be here for you.”

Looking at her in the darkness, I saw someone I had never seen before. It was still Bree, but it was like we were meeting each other for the first time. Not a fragile fallen angel and a wonder woman of steel. Just two people who saw each other’s broken hearts and loved each other anyway. Just a brother and a sister.

We sat in silence for another long moment before Bree stood up and walked to the curtains. “Mind if I open these? We need some light.”

I opened my eyes to see that dim fluorescent lights had replaced the gentle sunlight on Sandy’s porch. I noticed the taste of coffee on my tongue. The only coffee I had had in days came from Sandra.

“Hey there, look who’s awake.” Someone else was holding my hands instead of my new friend. It was a plump older nurse who had a look like she had not expected to be seen. “Sorry to bother you, sweetie. I was just adjusting your bedding. But looks like you’ll be going home soon.” I smiled confusedly at her. She scurried away to call the doctor.

I looked around, and my heart sank in my chest. I was back in the hospital. I had promised myself that I would never come back, and there I was. My memory flashed with the last sights I could recall before the Square: the heat of a blinding spotlight from the floor of the stage, Dotty and Senator Pruce’s faces hiding irritation, someone lifting me.

Searching my memory, I saw Bree’s frightened face above mine. She had carried me off the stage. She had had to carry me again—like she always did. I had let her down. She had given her life for the campaign, and I had killed it with my weakness. My failure. If anyone could save the campaign now, it was Bree. But I knew too much damage had been done. I laughed at myself with wry derision. I had wanted the campaign to end.

Before long, the nurse returned with a doctor who must have been near the end of his long career. His chipped nameplate read “P. Shelley.” While the nurse checked my vitals and helped me dress, Dr. Shelley told me what everyone in town already knew. Generalized anxiety disorder. Insomnia. And what only I had known. The struggle that hadn’t been presentable: extreme exhaustion, severe dehydration, dissociative symptoms, high blood alcohol levels. Dr. Shelley had me sign some forms I didn’t care to read and then continued on to his next patient. Watching Dr. Shelley walk away, I noticed that the linoleum floors were just the same as they were five years earlier. So was I.

The old nurse explained prescriptions to me and advised me against alcohol consumption with the patient exasperation of a high school guidance counselor. I nodded and waited for her to finish. Her warning was unnecessary. The taste of coffee had cleared the way for the taste of bile in my throat. After remembering the feeling of vomit pouring through my locked teeth with the entire county watching, I wasn’t going to drink again anytime soon.

The nurse walked me out to the lobby to retrieve my personal effects. I could hear a caller shouting at the receptionist through the landline. The receptionist gave me a friendly smile and handed over a large plastic bag with my watch, phone, and wallet. Taking out my things, I saw the visitor log through the bag’s clear plastic. A hospital this size normally didn’t have many visitors, but the same name was written for every day that week: Bree. My stomach twisted into a knot of guilt.

I turned on my phone out of habit. No one had called. Not even his parents. Relieved, I turned his phone back off. I wasn’t talking to anyone. The nurse helped me close the clasp of my watch. I didn’t need her to, but I appreciated her trying to help. “Thank you, Ms… I’m sorry I didn’t get your name.”

“Silvia,” she said. I gave her a familiar smile. “Thank you, Silvia. For everything.”

When I was almost out the waiting room door, Silvia called to me. “Hey sweetie…” She beckoned me back and lowered her voice to a whisper. Standing closer to her, I could smell cigarette smoke on her scrubs. “If you don’t mind me asking, what was that song you kept singing?”

“Um…I don’t remember. Was I singing? Sorry about that.”

“No, no. It’s okay. I was just curious. You kept singing to yourself while you were out. I thought I almost recognized the song. It was something like, *‘If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…*’” Silvia didn’t have any idea of what that song meant.

I intended to keep it that way. “I have no idea. Sorry.”

“Oh, it’s okay, hon. Now you go home and get some rest.” She gave me a kind squeeze on the arm.

I left the hospital with the sinking feeling that I would be back soon. I had thought I had handled my mental health—closed the file and checked the box for that part of my life. Apparently, it was a problem I would never solve. Walking to my car, I fought to keep the refrain of Sandy’s song—that song I had thought was a lullaby—from circling my mind.

I forgot it for a moment when I opened my car door and the heat almost knocked me out again. I should have remembered what a warm Mason County fall did to a locked car. When the song started up again, I turned on the radio. The station had been on public radio for years, but I turned it to the classic country station my mother played when I was a boy. One of her favorite songs was playing.

“Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side…”

Once I got to my apartment, I lost all sense of time. It didn’t matter anymore. I had left my laptop in my car and didn’t want to see all the emails from concerned clients asking about finding new representation. The campaign was over. My parents hadn’t called even after what they surely saw on the TV. And I certainly couldn’t talk to Bree—or even face her. Her disappointment would be unbearable. I badly wanted to drink. I was thankful that I couldn’t bring myself to go to the liquor store.

I couldn’t see the sun rise or fall through his curtains, but it felt like days passed. I just sat. Sometimes my mind showed him images of the local press reporting on my collapse and the campaign’s implosion. Sometimes I saw pictures of my parents going about their social lives as their associates conspicuously avoided my name in conversation. Most often, I saw Bree desperately holding the campaign together with prayers and press releases. I wished her the best. I couldn’t do it any more.

I heard a knock at the door. I ignored it. It was probably a canvasser for Pruce or one of the ballot initiatives. They would go away eventually.

The knock came again. I couldn’t move. I was sure whoever was out there had already judged me. I couldn’t do anything to impress them.

“Mikey,” the person at the door shouted. “I know you’re in there. You know I have a key…” It was Bree. She was angry. I thought about trying to hide before realizing how childish that would have been. I heard Bree’s key in the lock.

“Have you just been sitting here in the dark?” she scolded as she let herself in. “I’ve been trying to call you for the last thirty minutes. I went to the hospital, and they told me you had checked yourself out. What do you think—” She saw me sitting silently. She sat down her purse and sat beside me.

“I’m sorry,” I muttered.

“Hey, don’t worry about it.” She put her arm around my shoulders in an awkward attempt at warmth. “I was just scared when I couldn’t find you.”

“Thanks.”

“I’m just glad you’re alright.”

We sat in silence for a long moment. Neither of us had ever been taught how to handle this. We had been taught how to fight fear, how to power through pain. Never how to feel it.

“Mikey…” Bree said quietly. She was using all of her effort to form her emotions into words. “Um…”

With nothing left to prove, I hugged my sister. She hugged me back. In that instant, we didn’t need words.

“I’m sorry…” Bree continued as she instinctively held back her tears.

“It’s okay—”

“No, it’s not okay. Thank you, but no. I’m sorry for overworking you. I’m sorry for ignoring you when you tried to talk to me. I heard your words, but I didn’t listen for your feelings. I was scared to. I just tried to fix it. I thought that—all of *this* was what we were supposed to do.”

“I know. I did too.” We were sharing the same secret. “So, what happens to the campaign now? I’m sure you’ve been working overtime since I imploded.”

Bree caught the self-deprecation in my words. “Hey,” she said with protective anger. “Don’t say that. You didn’t implode. You let go. And I’m proud of you. The campaign doesn’t matter right now. You can decide what to do about it later.”

It felt like a weight was lifted from my lungs. I breathed freely for the first time I could remember.

“Michael, are you okay?” My name. The one my parents had given me when I was born. It had been years since I had heard it. Years since they decided “Mikey” would be more likable.

It was the question again. But it sounded different this time. Bree wasn’t asking it like she was expecting me to say my next line. She was asking to understand. To listen.

“I…” I wanted to meet my sister in her honesty. It took all of the little strength I had left to say the words I had to say. “I don’t know.”

In this unfamiliar vulnerability, I was afraid of what Bree would say. Saying I didn’t know was saying nothing. It didn’t give her anything to fix. It was only a confession.

“That’s okay.” Her voice told me I did not need forgiveness. “When you figure it out, I’ll be here for you.”

Looking at her in the darkness, I saw someone I had never seen before. It was still Bree, but it was like we were meeting each other for the first time. Not a fragile fallen angel and a wonder woman of steel. Just two people who saw each other’s broken hearts and loved each other anyway. Just a brother and a sister.

We sat in silence for another long moment before Bree stood up and walked to the curtains. “Mind if I open these? We need some light.”

“Sure. Thanks.”

When she opened the curtains, the amber sunlight of late afternoon peeked through the window. Behind her head, I saw a butterfly fly through the light. The soft warmth that fell on my skin felt like Sandra’s smile.

Sometimes my mind showed him images of the local press reporting on my collapse and the campaign’s implosion. Sometimes I saw pictures of my parents going about their social lives as their associates conspicuously avoided my name in conversation. Most often, I saw Bree desperately holding the campaign together with prayers and press releases. I wished her the best. I couldn’t do it any more.

I heard a knock at the door. I ignored it. It was probably a canvasser for Pruce or one of the ballot initiatives. They would go away eventually.

The knock came again. I couldn’t move. I was sure whoever was out there had already judged me. I couldn’t do anything to impress them.

“Mikey,” the person at the door shouted. “I know you’re in there. You know I have a key…” It was Bree. She was angry. I thought about trying to hide before realizing how childish that would have been. I heard Bree’s key in the lock.

“Have you just been sitting here in the dark?” she scolded as she let herself in. “I’ve been trying to call you for the last thirty minutes. I went to the hospital, and they told me you had checked yourself out. What do you think—” She saw me sitting silently. She sat down her purse and sat beside me.

“I’m sorry,” I muttered.

“Hey, don’t worry about it.” She put her arm around my shoulders in an awkward attempt at warmth. “I was just scared when I couldn’t find you.”

“Thanks.”

“I’m just glad you’re alright.”

We sat in silence for a long moment. Neither of us had ever been taught how to handle this. We had been taught how to fight fear, how to power through pain. Never how to feel it.

“Mikey…” Bree said quietly. She was using all of her effort to form her emotions into words. “Um…”

With nothing left to prove, I hugged my sister. She hugged me back. In that instant, we didn’t need words.

“I’m sorry…” Bree continued as she instinctively held back her tears.

“It’s okay—”

“No, it’s not okay. Thank you, but no. I’m sorry for overworking you. I’m sorry for ignoring you when you tried to talk to me. I heard your words, but I didn’t listen for your feelings. I was scared to. I just tried to fix it. I thought that—all of *this* was what we were supposed to do.”

“I know. I did too.” We were sharing the same secret. “So, what happens to the campaign now? I’m sure you’ve been working overtime since I imploded.”

Bree caught the self-deprecation in my words. “Hey,” she said with protective anger. “Don’t say that. You didn’t implode. You let go. And I’m proud of you. The campaign doesn’t matter right now. You can decide what to do about it later.”

It felt like a weight was lifted from my lungs. I breathed freely for the first time I could remember.

“Michael, are you okay?” My name. The one my parents had given me when I was born. It had been years since I had heard it. Years since they decided “Mikey” would be more likable.

It was the question again. But it sounded different this time. Bree wasn’t asking it like she was expecting me to say my next line. She was asking to understand. To listen.

“I…” I wanted to meet my sister in her honesty. It took all of the little strength I had left to say the words I had to say. “I don’t know.”

In this unfamiliar vulnerability, I was afraid of what Bree would say. Saying I didn’t know was saying nothing. It didn’t give her anything to fix. It was only a confession.

“That’s okay.” Her voice told me I did not need forgiveness. “When you figure it out, I’ll be here for you.”

Looking at her in the darkness, I saw someone I had never seen before. It was still Bree, but it was like we were meeting each other for the first time. Not a fragile fallen angel and a wonder woman of steel. Just two people who saw each other’s broken hearts and loved each other anyway. Just a brother and a sister.

We sat in silence for another long moment before Bree stood up and walked to the curtains. “Mind if I open these? We need some light.”

“Sure. Thanks.”

When she opened the curtains, the amber sunlight of late afternoon peeked through the window. Behind her head, I saw a butterfly fly through the light. The soft warmth that fell on my skin felt like Sandra’s smile.",1,1763412993.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
1ozs3tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ozs3tg/i_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_because_he_couldnt/,I broke up with my boyfriend because he couldn’t stand up for me.,"I (f28) broke up with my boyfriend (m29) about a week and a half ago. It’s been so hard, and I have really healthy coping habits that I’ve been focusing on. I journal, go to yoga, work out, cry, talk with friends, plan new hobbies, etc., but I’m having a really difficult time, and it’s been very painful for me. I would love to hear any advice, and I also think writing in full would help me process.

Our relationship was one of the most pure and loving relationships I’ve ever had, and we were together for 2.5 years. He was truly one of the most caring and loving souls I’ve ever met. I’m very adventurous and have a lot of things I enjoy doing that are out of the norm, as people would say. I’m super girly, loving pink, wearing cute dresses, going shopping, taking photos, but I also love going dirtbiking with my friends, traveling, going to the shooting range, etc. We bonded over those things, but one main issue was that he hasn’t had much life experience. He lives with his parents, never left the city he was born, raised, and still lives in (other than for one year of college). I was the first real relationship he’s had in 7 years, since he was in college. (He dated one girl who flirted with his friends for 4 months, and he broke up with her and moved back home.) I worked with him a lot on finding new experiences for us and encouraging him to be more confident in himself. I taught him to dirtbike, he got his motorcycle license, and took on more responsibilities at work.

I met his friends at the start and they all seemed to approve and invite us out to events and activities but suddenly stopped. I didn’t know how to go about it but he just brushed it under the rug and said we can continue to do our thing. I started having not great feelings about his friendship with his good friend’s wife (f32) as he was always snapchatting her and it just seemed like something someone who was 17 would do. I talked with him about it and he didn’t handle it great at first but then quickly fixed the problem and deleted her, took me out for a nice dinner, and reassured me that he loves me and would never let her or anyone come between us. We continued building our relationship. 

That same girl started being really rude to me and anytime we went to a mutual friend’s wedding or event she would ignore me completely and walk in the other direction, whispering to the other wives/gfs about me and it was something out of high school. I’m someone who’s pretty confident in myself so I just ignored it and focused on my own thing always. His guy friends seemed to like me but it was always the wives who had problems. His friends loved to drink and I don’t. One time one of them said that I wasn’t invited to play in their volleyball tournament with them since I don’t drink. My boyfriend didn’t go but didn’t tell them why and he has a huge issue with being a people pleaser.
 
We continued building and growing our relationship, traveled together, and did a lot together. Talking about marriage, kids and our future. Everything seemed to be going really well and I thought he was going to propose this year but I had a gut feeling something was wrong so I started going to therapy. I worked on things with myself and then my boyfriend started joining me for a few couples sessions. My therapist was encouraging him to learn to be more independent from his parents. His parents provided everything for him, he’s never really had to worry about being fired from his job or had any stress in it since he works in their business, he hasn’t ever had to pay for his own car, he’s comfortable living at home even though he can definitely afford to move out. I didn’t blame him or ever make him feel bad for getting to be provided for by them and I thought it was good that he was able to save so much money each month, but it was also holding him back a lot.

Two weekends ago we made a plan to go dirtbiking together and got everything ready for it. He then said that same friend and his wife had their 1 year old birthday for their baby and he wanted to be there for that milestone and if we could reschedule dirtbiking. I felt off about it but just said no problem. I realized I wasn’t invited to the party. We had a session with my therapist and she told him that he needed to find out what issue those friends have with me and stand up for his girlfriend. He messaged that girl and she said she needed to talk with him in person about it. I didn’t feel comfortable with that and I told him that if he’s going to see her, I would want to be there. He didn’t tell me right away but he ended up meeting with her and her husband for dinner at a restaurant and was there for 2h. He didn’t call me on the way back home or anything.

I had a lot of anxiety about the situation and finally I called him once I saw he was home. He was very calm and said he was talking to his mom but that basically he found out that his friends don’t like me because of my political views. I have never talked politics with them and I don’t really post it on my social media. He’s also on the same side politically as me.

Apparently me having my hobbies and having some photos with an American flag on my Instagram was enough for them to decide that I’m against that they believe. I though it was ridiculous and I asked him what did he say to stand up for me and he said he didn’t say anything to them other than he would talk to me to not post anything that might offend them.

I was very upset as the conversation continued. His mom was saying to give it time and just didn’t really understand the situation and agreed with him that I shouldn’t talk with them about politics. It was very frustrating being accused of something I didn’t do. I’m very good at expressing myself and saying clearly what I want, need and am feeling. He isn’t and the rest of the conversation he just didn’t know how to handle it. I ended up telling him that I didn’t think he was mature enough for a relationship with me and that I love him very much but I can’t be with a guy who can’t stand up for me and the things I believe in. He said we’re not breaking up over this and decided to drive over to my house to talk in person.

He arrived and sat in my room. He didn’t know that to say and he thought we would work things out but at that point I just cried and was quiet. He hugged me and held my hands. He said he didn’t know what to do and I told him he should have stood up for me, and protected me, no matter what. He didn’t say anything after that and I held his hands and prayed for him to be confident, to discover who he is, to never allow anyone to stop him from reaching his fullest potential and to always move forward in life. I told him again that we’re breaking up and he broke down and cried. He apologized for not being able to be the one to put a ring on my finger but hopes I’ll find someone who will someday. He started to walk away and then came back and hugged me tight again saying he didn’t want to leave. He kissed my forehead one last time. He let go and left saying goodbye to me. It was the saddest breakup I’ve gone through. 

I’ve been going through all the emotions and reflecting back on everything. I always told him it’s okay to disagree with me on things and have things of his own going on too. That it was okay to make mistakes in life and communication was the most important thing. I have been journaling everyday for the past 5 years and have been reading back on times of us together. Things I missed that were important. 

I loved his family but realized that they never actually got to know me. They never even wished me a happy birthday, they never met my sister, or been to my house, even though I have invited them a few times. But they would always have something come up as it wasn’t a priority for them. They were always doing their things in their lives and I would show up for my boyfriend. His mom never once sat down and had a coffee with me or invited me to spend time with her. Same with his siblings who were much older and more successful than him. I’ve been grieving a lot and processing everything as best as I can. I feel in my gut that the reason his friends didn’t like me wasn’t truly due to politics. I feel like that wife of his friend has feelings for my boyfriend. And I’ll never truly know since I wasn’t at that dinner. I don’t even know if her husband came with her. (I do know that she didn’t tell her husband anything about the situation). My boyfriend’s mom is close with their families and he’s been friends with them for over 10 years.

I’ve been accepting that I made the right choice and I know that I said the right things. There’s always room to learn and grow and I do believe that if he does the things that will make him uncomfortable, and break away from these people that are holding him back, he’ll grow. I’ve been working on myself too, trying to build up a new confidence again. 

I sent him one last message 3 days after the breakup and talked about that with him. I told him I love him and will always love him. I told him the things I said during the prayer. To always stand up for the things he believes in and never allow anyone to stop him from reaching his potential. And that I would do the same. At the end of it all we will win, even if that means we will both win separately. 
He responded and said it was well said and he will always love me as well and always value all the things I taught him in life. 

I don’t want to delete our photos or forget our moments together. I wish he had people in his life to help him out of being stuck, to motivate him and tell him to be better. But I think that’s something he needs to discover for himself. I’m truly heartbroken and haven’t cried as much as this ever. I don’t know when I’ll feel better. I don’t want to imagine starting over with someone new. All my dreams of being a wife and mom one day seemed to have disappeared. I get angry thinking about his friends, his family, but I can’t seem to find myself being angry at him.

I opened my eyes to see that dim fluorescent lights had replaced the gentle sunlight on Sandy’s porch. I noticed the taste of coffee on my tongue. The only coffee I had had in days came from Sandra.

“Hey there, look who’s awake.” Someone else was holding my hands instead of my new friend. It was a plump older nurse who had a look like she had not expected to be seen. “Sorry to bother you, sweetie. I was just adjusting your bedding. But looks like you’ll be going home soon.” I smiled confusedly at her. She scurried away to call the doctor.

I looked around, and my heart sank in my chest. I was back in the hospital. I had promised myself that I would never come back, and there I was. My memory flashed with the last sights I could recall before the Square: the heat of a blinding spotlight from the floor of the stage, Dotty and Senator Pruce’s faces hiding irritation, someone lifting me.

Searching my memory, I saw Bree’s frightened face above mine. She had carried me off the stage. She had had to carry me again—like she always did. I had let her down. She had given her life for the campaign, and I had killed it with my weakness. My failure. If anyone could save the campaign now, it was Bree. But I knew too much damage had been done. I laughed at myself with wry derision. I had wanted the campaign to end.

Before long, the nurse returned with a doctor who must have been near the end of his long career. His chipped nameplate read “P. Shelley.” While the nurse checked my vitals and helped me dress, Dr. Shelley told me what everyone in town already knew. Generalized anxiety disorder. Insomnia. And what only I had known. The struggle that hadn’t been presentable: extreme exhaustion, severe dehydration, dissociative symptoms, high blood alcohol levels. Dr. Shelley had me sign some forms I didn’t care to read and then continued on to his next patient. Watching Dr. Shelley walk away, I noticed that the linoleum floors were just the same as they were five years earlier. So was I.

The old nurse explained prescriptions to me and advised me against alcohol consumption with the patient exasperation of a high school guidance counselor. I nodded and waited for her to finish. Her warning was unnecessary. The taste of coffee had cleared the way for the taste of bile in my throat. After remembering the feeling of vomit pouring through my locked teeth with the entire county watching, I wasn’t going to drink again anytime soon.

The nurse walked me out to the lobby to retrieve my personal effects. I could hear a caller shouting at the receptionist through the landline. The receptionist gave me a friendly smile and handed over a large plastic bag with my watch, phone, and wallet. Taking out my things, I saw the visitor log through the bag’s clear plastic. A hospital this size normally didn’t have many visitors, but the same name was written for every day that week: Bree. My stomach twisted into a knot of guilt.

I turned on my phone out of habit. No one had called. Not even his parents. Relieved, I turned his phone back off. I wasn’t talking to anyone. The nurse helped me close the clasp of my watch. I didn’t need her to, but I appreciated her trying to help. “Thank you, Ms… I’m sorry I didn’t get your name.”

“Silvia,” she said. I gave her a familiar smile. “Thank you, Silvia. For everything.”

When I was almost out the waiting room door, Silvia called to me. “Hey sweetie…” She beckoned me back and lowered her voice to a whisper. Standing closer to her, I could smell cigarette smoke on her scrubs. “If you don’t mind me asking, what was that song you kept singing?”

“Um…I don’t remember. Was I singing? Sorry about that.”

“No, no. It’s okay. I was just curious. You kept singing to yourself while you were out. I thought I almost recognized the song. It was something like, *‘If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…*’” Silvia didn’t have any idea of what that song meant.

I intended to keep it that way. “I have no idea. Sorry.”

“Oh, it’s okay, hon. Now you go home and get some rest.” She gave me a kind squeeze on the arm.

I left the hospital with the sinking feeling that I would be back soon. I had thought I had handled my mental health—closed the file and checked the box for that part of my life. Apparently, it was a problem I would never solve. Walking to my car, I fought to keep the refrain of Sandy’s song—that song I had thought was a lullaby—from circling my mind.

I forgot it for a moment when I opened my car door and the heat almost knocked me out again. I should have remembered what a warm Mason County fall did to a locked car. When the song started up again, I turned on the radio. The station had been on public radio for years, but I turned it to the classic country station my mother played when I was a boy. One of her favorite songs was playing.

“Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side…”

Once I got to my apartment, I lost all sense of time. It didn’t matter anymore. I had left my laptop in my car and didn’t want to see all the emails from concerned clients asking about finding new representation. The campaign was over. My parents hadn’t called even after what they surely saw on the TV. And I certainly couldn’t talk to Bree—or even face her. Her disappointment would be unbearable. I badly wanted to drink. I was thankful that I couldn’t bring myself to go to the liquor store.

I couldn’t see the sun rise or fall through his curtains, but it felt like days passed. I just sat. Sometimes my mind showed him images of the local press reporting on my collapse and the campaign’s implosion. Sometimes I saw pictures of my parents going about their social lives as their associates conspicuously avoided my name in conversation. Most often, I saw Bree desperately holding the campaign together with prayers and press releases. I wished her the best. I couldn’t do it any more.

I heard a knock at the door. I ignored it. It was probably a canvasser for Pruce or one of the ballot initiatives. They would go away eventually.

The knock came again. I couldn’t move. I was sure whoever was out there had already judged me. I couldn’t do anything to impress them.

“Mikey,” the person at the door shouted. “I know you’re in there. You know I have a key…” It was Bree. She was angry. I thought about trying to hide before realizing how childish that would have been. I heard Bree’s key in the lock.

“Have you just been sitting here in the dark?” she scolded as she let herself in. “I’ve been trying to call you for the last thirty minutes. I went to the hospital, and they told me you had checked yourself out. What do you think—” She saw me sitting silently. She sat down her purse and sat beside me.

“I’m sorry,” I muttered.

“Hey, don’t worry about it.” She put her arm around my shoulders in an awkward attempt at warmth. “I was just scared when I couldn’t find you.”

“Thanks.”

“I’m just glad you’re alright.”

We sat in silence for a long moment. Neither of us had ever been taught how to handle this. We had been taught how to fight fear, how to power through pain. Never how to feel it.

“Mikey…” Bree said quietly. She was using all of her effort to form her emotions into words. “Um…”

With nothing left to prove, I hugged my sister. She hugged me back. In that instant, we didn’t need words.

“I’m sorry…” Bree continued as she instinctively held back her tears.

“It’s okay—”

“No, it’s not okay. Thank you, but no. I’m sorry for overworking you. I’m sorry for ignoring you when you tried to talk to me. I heard your words, but I didn’t listen for your feelings. I was scared to. I just tried to fix it. I thought that—all of *this* was what we were supposed to do.”

“I know. I did too.” We were sharing the same secret. “So, what happens to the campaign now? I’m sure you’ve been working overtime since I imploded.”

Bree caught the self-deprecation in my words. “Hey,” she said with protective anger. “Don’t say that. You didn’t implode. You let go. And I’m proud of you. The campaign doesn’t matter right now. You can decide what to do about it later.”

It felt like a weight was lifted from my lungs. I breathed freely for the first time I could remember.

“Michael, are you okay?” My name. The one my parents had given me when I was born. It had been years since I had heard it. Years since they decided “Mikey” would be more likable.

It was the question again. But it sounded different this time. Bree wasn’t asking it like she was expecting me to say my next line. She was asking to understand. To listen.

“I…” I wanted to meet my sister in her honesty. It took all of the little strength I had left to say the words I had to say. “I don’t know.”

In this unfamiliar vulnerability, I was afraid of what Bree would say. Saying I didn’t know was saying nothing. It didn’t give her anything to fix. It was only a confession.

“That’s okay.” Her voice told me I did not need forgiveness. “When you figure it out, I’ll be here for you.”

Looking at her in the darkness, I saw someone I had never seen before. It was still Bree, but it was like we were meeting each other for the first time. Not a fragile fallen angel and a wonder woman of steel. Just two people who saw each other’s broken hearts and loved each other anyway. Just a brother and a sister.

We sat in silence for another long moment before Bree stood up and walked to the curtains. “Mind if I open these? We need some light.”

“Sure. Thanks.”

When she opened the curtains, the amber sunlight of late afternoon peeked through the window. Behind her head, I saw a butterfly fly through the light. The soft warmth that fell on my skin felt like Sandra’s smile.

I opened my eyes to see that dim fluorescent lights had replaced the gentle sunlight on Sandy’s porch. I noticed the taste of coffee on my tongue. The only coffee I had had in days came from Sandra.

“Hey there, look who’s awake.” Someone else was holding my hands instead of my new friend. It was a plump older nurse who had a look like she had not expected to be seen. “Sorry to bother you, sweetie. I was just adjusting your bedding. But looks like you’ll be going home soon.” I smiled confusedly at her. She scurried away to call the doctor.

I looked around, and my heart sank in my chest. I was back in the hospital. I had promised myself that I would never come back, and there I was. My memory flashed with the last sights I could recall before the Square: the heat of a blinding spotlight from the floor of the stage, Dotty and Senator Pruce’s faces hiding irritation, someone lifting me.

Searching my memory, I saw Bree’s frightened face above mine. She had carried me off the stage. She had had to carry me again—like she always did. I had let her down. She had given her life for the campaign, and I had killed it with my weakness. My failure. If anyone could save the campaign now, it was Bree. But I knew too much damage had been done. I laughed at myself with wry derision. I had wanted the campaign to end.

Before long, the nurse returned with a doctor who must have been near the end of his long career. His chipped nameplate read “P. Shelley.” While the nurse checked my vitals and helped me dress, Dr. Shelley told me what everyone in town already knew. Generalized anxiety disorder. Insomnia. And what only I had known. The struggle that hadn’t been presentable: extreme exhaustion, severe dehydration, dissociative symptoms, high blood alcohol levels. Dr. Shelley had me sign some forms I didn’t care to read and then continued on to his next patient. Watching Dr. Shelley walk away, I noticed that the linoleum floors were just the same as they were five years earlier. So was I.

The old nurse explained prescriptions to me and advised me against alcohol consumption with the patient exasperation of a high school guidance counselor. I nodded and waited for her to finish. Her warning was unnecessary. The taste of coffee had cleared the way for the taste of bile in my throat. After remembering the feeling of vomit pouring through my locked teeth with the entire county watching, I wasn’t going to drink again anytime soon.

The nurse walked me out to the lobby to retrieve my personal effects. I could hear a caller shouting at the receptionist through the landline. The receptionist gave me a friendly smile and handed over a large plastic bag with my watch, phone, and wallet. Taking out my things, I saw the visitor log through the bag’s clear plastic. A hospital this size normally didn’t have many visitors, but the same name was written for every day that week: Bree. My stomach twisted into a knot of guilt.

I turned on my phone out of habit. No one had called. Not even his parents. Relieved, I turned his phone back off. I wasn’t talking to anyone. The nurse helped me close the clasp of my watch. I didn’t need her to, but I appreciated her trying to help. “Thank you, Ms… I’m sorry I didn’t get your name.”

“Silvia,” she said. I gave her a familiar smile. “Thank you, Silvia. For everything.”

When I was almost out the waiting room door, Silvia called to me. “Hey sweetie…” She beckoned me back and lowered her voice to a whisper. Standing closer to her, I could smell cigarette smoke on her scrubs. “If you don’t mind me asking, what was that song you kept singing?”

“Um…I don’t remember. Was I singing? Sorry about that.”

“No, no. It’s okay. I was just curious. You kept singing to yourself while you were out. I thought I almost recognized the song. It was something like, *‘If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…*’” Silvia didn’t have any idea of what that song meant.

Anyways a few months ago I got my project car up and operational again. it's an old BMW, a wonderful little shitbox that I've been very slowly turning into a track car. And I stop to get coffee. The car is gutted (no irrelevant interior radio carpet and for this story no cup holders) so I stand outside next to it and drink my coffee when this woman comes up to me. She has the kind but intense brown eyes of my dreams and she compliments my car. We chat for a bit and then go our separate ways. I thought nothing of it at the time outside of thinking later ""oh she might been flirting"" but that was about it so then months go by and im getting lunch pretty far from where that previous interaction occurred (I was on break at work and work is a little over an hour away) I ran into the same or another woman im not sure which but the vibe was the same as the dream I struck up a conversation with her which is weird for me cause I struggle bad with social anxiety especially around strangers. Anyways I was in a rush to get back to work and growing more anxious the longer the conversation drew on so I left (I feel bad tho she had alot of bags and I should have offered to help her get them out to her car). Anyways that's the story not a lot to it other than it being pretty weird and I don't really know what to make of it if anything. It could be that I talked to her just because I've been training myself to do that in order to hopefully get over the social anxiety but im unsure. But I just wanted to tell the story and it felt way to weird to tell any of my freinds and frankly it feels weird to put it here too but this is the internet.",3,1763412887.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

### Race Information
* **Name:** Harrisburg Marathon
* **Date:** November 9, 2025
* **Distance:** 26.2 miles
* **Location:** Harrisburg, PA
* **Time:** 3:25:25

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Sub 3:23 | *No* |
| B | Sub 3:30 | *Yes* |
| C | Finish | *Yes* |


Second marathon on the books and thought I’d share notes, especially for folks who might be interested in doing Harrisburg.  I’m a 45 year old guy, no track / XC experience but played sports and always enjoyed running.

Always appreciate the advice from this group.  Thank you!

**Pre-Race:**

Got into downtown Harrisburg around 5pm the night before the race, so didn’t have a chance to see the expo.  Cheap room at the Crowne Plaza about a 5 minute walk to the start line on City Island.  Not much at all going on in Harrisburg Saturday night.

Low-key vibe morning of the race.  Small crowd in City Island parking lot.  Hardly any lines to porta-potties or to pick up my bib.

Weather turned out solid.  Forecast was iffy all week, calling for localized heavy rain and wind gusts though out the race (days prior had been spectacular).  Thankfully we got an overcast, upper-40’s, rain and wind free day.  Great race conditions minus a tad humid.

**During the Race:**

Not sure what happened with watch data on mile 1.  Course was 2 loops of the half marathon route.  Super flat with only slightest of inclines on a bridge plus another part of the course.  Most of the course was on the bike path, road, and bridges around the Susquehanna river.  About 6 or so u-turns on the course.  Understandable for traffic closure reasons, but I’d have preferred the course to go through some neighborhoods.  

Good crowd support for a small town marathon.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Super easy for spectators to get around; my wife brought a bike and was able to ride to different parts of the course for support.  Excellent!  Water stations with Gatorade every few miles.  A few had gels and bananas.  Fireball shot guy around mile 24.

I was shooting for 3:23-ish/7:45 per mile.  Runna app had predicted in 3:15’s but I didn’t trust it, plus I had been sick during the taper (taper flu?).  I had the nutrition dialed but went conservative.  Peaked at 50mpw with 4 or 5 weeks in the mid 40’s mpw; thought I’d need more than that to shoot for sub 3:20.  Really didn’t want to blow up around mile 22.

Maurten bar and drink mix for breakfast plus half cup of coffee.  Alternated huma and maurten gels every 30 minutes plus honey stinger chews on the hour.  Drank a bit of Gatorade at every aid station.  Took salt stick tablets each hour on the hour and had my wife toss me a bottle with LMNT salt during the second half.  I really think this helped hold off cramps during last few miles.

Pace felt comfortable pretty much the entire way.  Last 4 miles were tough but I definitely felt stronger during them than I did my first marathon.  Spent a lot of time doing leg and hip strengthening over the past year. 

I met a guy around mile 23 and stuck with him to the finish.  he really helped me keep pace up and finish strong.  Kudos to Nick from Maryland wherever you are!   

Last mile was pretty disorganized—you cross a footbridge back to City Island, which was crowded with pedestrians.  Then you take a loop around the outside of the baseball field, which is the opposite direction of the finish line.  Signage not great.  Perhaps it was just foggy head from me trying to finish!

**Post-Race:**

One time we will stick around post race and party!  Grabbed a water and walked back to the hotel for shower and check out.  Had to get home ASAP for kids sports.  So it goes!

Definitely felt better physically after finishing than last year.  My calves were wrecked but everything else was ok.  A beer and solid food (so sick of the carb load!) and I was conked out early.  Up and at work bright and early Monday.

**Final Thoughts:**

Managed to keep my HR pretty well in check.  Perhaps could have squeezed out another minute or two faster but I’m good with it.

Harrisburg was a pretty well organized, small, mellow marathon.  Easy access to everything.  I’m glad I did it.  Weather can be unpredictable this time of year and I could see it being particularly tough with bad weather since so much of the race is by the river.  Thankfully got a good day.  Didn’t hit my A goal but still very satisfied with the result.  Feel like I’ve got a much better handle on nutrition both during training and during the race at this point.  

Trying to figure out what’s next.  Would like to try Pfitz 18/55 as I didn’t love the Runna app.  Will definitely do another small marathon in the future. Onward!",19,1763412698.0,Marathon_Training,1,1.0,False

1ozrxot,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ozrxot,Help with Living Room,"I recently moved in and feel like there is better way to layout the living/dining room space. Here is my lovely color coded scribble key: 

Yellow: couch
Green: sofa chair, facing coffee table
Blue: coffee table
Pink: tv
Red: dining table
Black: side tables next to couch with lamps, small shelves with board games, standing lamp. (Note: my drawing isn't perfect, and there is actually a 2 foot gap between the leftmost side table and the notched corner when I currently have two small floor baskets with blankets)

The thing that bothers me is that the sofa chair looks awkward and sorta isolated when looking at it from the kitchen and dining room. I have the dining table against the wall to create a better walkway, but also because my 4th chair got pretty beat up from the move and I am only using 3 in this layout. I am not a huge fan of the original layout on the unedited floor plan either, as having my back to the balcony feels weird to me and the room looks squished.",1,1763412587.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False

# What Makes Perplexity Comet AI Assistant Insane

Most AI tools talk.  
**Perplexity Comet AI Assistant** *acts.*

It doesn’t just fetch search results — it opens tabs, fills spreadsheets, compares prices, applies for jobs, and books travel while you do something else.

Think of it as a digital team that never stops, never forgets, and never needs coffee.

# The Big Shift in How You Work Online

Before Comet, multitasking meant chaos.  
Dozens of tabs, endless copy-paste, constant tab switching.

Now?  
You tell Comet what you want once.

>

It opens the listings, checks commute times on Google Maps, and drops the data into a spreadsheet — in minutes.

That’s what makes **Perplexity Comet AI Assistant** different. It’s not a chatbot — it’s a working assistant.

# How Perplexity Comet AI Assistant Works (And Why It’s So Smart)

Here’s the secret sauce.

Comet can view **multiple tabs simultaneously**.  
It can pull information from one tab and paste it into another — instantly.

If you’ve ever done research, travel planning, or lead generation, you know how big this is.  
Hours shrink into minutes.

# Example 1 — Job Search Automation

Finding jobs online is painful.

You open LinkedIn, scroll through positions, fill the same forms ten times.

**Perplexity Comet AI Assistant** fixes that.  
You type:

>

It searches, filters, saves the good ones, even starts filling out applications if you approve.  
That’s hours saved.

# Example 2 — Travel Planning With AI

Travel used to mean 10 tabs and a headache.  
Now you say:

>

**Perplexity Comet AI Assistant** searches flight and hotel sites at the same time.  
It compares prices, checks availability, and presents everything side by side.  
You approve the deal.  
Done.

# Example 3 — Online Shopping Simplified

Instead of opening Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart yourself, ask Comet to compare all three.

It pulls prices, reviews, and discounts into one view.  
Then it adds the best option to your cart if you say yes.

The **Perplexity Comet AI Assistant** turns online shopping into a one-sentence task.

# Real-Time Permission Control

You stay in control.

Comet asks before every major action — logging in, filling forms, making purchases.  
If you allow something once, it remembers.  
If it’s risky, it asks again.

This is how **Perplexity Comet AI Assistant** balances power and safety.

# The November 2025 Upgrade: Why It Matters

The latest update made Comet 23% better at complex tasks.  
That’s huge — most AI updates barely hit 2%.

Comet can now understand website layouts, fill interactive forms, and click buttons like a human.  
It even shows you *why* it’s taking each action before it does it.

Transparency = trust.  
Speed = profit.

# Background Assistant Mode (For Power Users)

For Mac users, there’s a background mode.

Give Comet multiple tasks at once:  
– Send an email  
– Find concert tickets  
– Book a dinner reservation

It runs them in parallel while you work on something else.  
You get a dashboard that shows each task’s progress in real time.

That’s the future of productivity.

# Interface & Safety Features

**Perplexity Comet AI Assistant** lives in a sidebar on your browser.  
You open any webpage and it’s already there, seeing what you see in real time.

Ask it to summarize the page or extract key points — no copy-paste needed.

And security?  
Perplexity partnered with 1Password.  
Your logins stay protected.  
The AI can autofill forms but never sees your passwords.

You’re always in control.

# When Comet Gets Confused

No tool is perfect.  
About 5% of sites use heavy security scripts that trip it up.

When that happens, just finish the task manually.  
The other 95% of the time, Comet works like magic.

# Practical Prompts To Try With Perplexity Comet AI Assistant

Here are some you can use today:

• **Job Search:** “Find product manager jobs at creative software companies on LinkedIn.”

• **Product Research:** “Compare laptops under $1,000 from major retailers.”

If you can use ChatGPT, you can use Comet.

For the sake of good juju let me start by saying they are a very kind person and very polite. Here’s the issues and maybe I’m just being sensitive. You know when someone sips a coffee and they go “ahhh” after? Like an exhale from the heat of the beverage or something? It’s SO loud and overly exaggerated. And I truly mean that. It cuts through the silence in the room. When they eat, they attack their food like it’s trying to escape. Then afterwards they hock and snort in air as if they’re getting over a cold (I’d imagine it’s a food allergy of sorts). They chew ice with their mouth open. I almost feel like there’s a hidden camera game show on me trying to test me. Lastly anytime we talk about any intellectual topics they will one up anything I or a coworker says by sounding smarter, saying bigger words and giving tons of unnecessary information and facts about the topic at hand. I really wish you guys could experience this I think you would understand. 

Question is: what do I do?

I wear AirPods on noise cancellation mode. I take my lunch break elsewhere when they start theirs. My next option is going to change offices but I don’t want to seem like I can’t get along with them to my boss (and also I have a sick large window overlooking the city)

“You’re late.” That’s all they say to me before I’m pulled inside.

I see them framed in the double door.
A group of people,
Roiling on the concrete floor.
“What are you doing?” I ask, words barely audible over the thrumming around us.
“Celebrating baby! Don’t you know? The world is dead and we are throwing a party!”
The man at the edge of the group yells toward me.
Hands motioning for me to join.

I’m on the couch.
Walled in on both sides by strangers.
Their alcohol doing the talking.
“Darling I think I love the world,
I also think that I am too fucked up to drive.”

He presses his mouth to my ear.

Staring down I see them.
Backlit by the full moon their hair waves in the breeze.
I wave back at the face down figure.
Their arms held above their head in celebration,
One leg up in a jump for joy.
I turn around and leave,
Not wanting to interrupt another soul out celebrating the end of things.

I walk along the suburban paths.
Flanked by nice, neat houses on either side.
I look to my right.
See the pristine white ranch looking back at me.
A picket fence almost too cliche to exist.
The dead dog in the window winks as I walk by.

Next I’m standing in front of the 24 hour diner.

If you’re curious but not sure how it actually feels or works, this might help.

# “What even is OMAD in real life?”

It’s exactly what it sounds like—one solid meal inside a short window. Not grazing, not snacking, not squeezing in “tiny bites.” Just one intentional, balanced meal.  
 Once I got used to it, the rest of the day felt weirdly peaceful because food wasn’t running the show.

# “Does it actually make a difference with fat loss?”

For me, yeah. Not because of magic—just fewer chances to overeat. When I removed all-day snacking, my intake lined up better with what my body actually needed.

# “Am I going to feel exhausted?”

My first few days were rough, but mostly because I wasn’t drinking enough water or electrolytes. Once I fixed that, the fatigue eased up. After that, the long fasting window felt way smoother than expected.

# “What happens to hunger?”

It comes in waves. The funny part is that the waves don’t last. Ghrelin spikes hit at the times you *used* to eat, then fade. After about a week, those spikes showed up less often and didn’t feel nearly as loud.

# “Is OMAD hard on the mind?”

For me it made things calmer. Not having to plan meals all day took away this low-level stress I didn’t even know I was carrying. My thoughts stayed steadier, and I felt more present at work.

# “What do you even eat in that one meal?”

I keep it simple:

* a strong protein source  
* a bunch of vegetables  
* a carb if I trained or had a long day  
* enough fat to keep me full through the fast  

Nothing wild—just food that actually keeps me steady.

**“Does the meal need to be huge?”**

No.  
 I tried doing “mega plates” in the start and it only made me sluggish. A balanced meal hits way better than stuffing yourself.

# “What if the scale jumps up and down?”

Totally normal. Mine did it constantly. Weekly patterns ended up telling me a lot more than daily weigh-ins.

**“Is it okay to have coffee during the fast?”**

Plain coffee? Yeah, most people do. I keep it simple and skip anything that’s sweetened in the fasting hours.

# “How do you even start OMAD without burning out?”

I didn’t jump right in. I eased down:

* normal eating →  
* 16:8 →  
* 20:4 →  
* OMAD  

That slow approach made the switch way smoother.

# “Who should think twice about OMAD?”

Anyone with blood-sugar issues, certain meds, or a rocky history with food patterns should talk to a doctor. No shame in that—safety matters.

# “What if progress stalls?”

The fixes that helped me:

* more protein  
* slightly shifting the meal time  
* a bit more walking  

Small changes made big differences.

If you want, I can share:

* a day-in-my-life OMAD rundown  
* what I eat in my single meal  
* how I handled cravings  
* how I balanced OMAD with workouts  

Just tell me what direction you want next.

Granted, I did just have coffee and a bowl of oatmeal possibly high in sugars. But I’ve never had issues like this before in my LIFE. I drink coffee everyday… I can’t tolerate weed or hot showers for more than 5-10 mins anymore. Both things send my hr through the roof. If I’m in the shower steaming hot for more than 5-10 mins I feel like I’m gonna pass out, I almost did once lol. I used to consume weed everyday until these symptoms came about. Now I can’t take a small hit of a joint or more than 2.5mg edible without my hr hitting the 120s. Freaks me tf out.

I have a cardiologist appt. in a couple days. Please if anyone has any advice or suggestions on how to get a proper diagnosis, what I should say, etc. Your diagnosis story would help a lot too!

I’m concerned they’ll just brush me off, I get really nervous at the doctors and forget all my symptoms the moment I’m asked about it lolll.

You make me—force me—to kneel to you, as if this fate was carved for me since birth.

Your hands touch my body, staining it with your darkness, engraving your name and your claim on my skin—shouting to the world that I belong to you.
You pull me into your arms and push me to heights of ecstasy my body had never known.

Under the moonlight I saw your truth: a starving beast whispering venom just to make me fall into his trap.
I knew the consequences, yet all I wanted was to drown in the heaven of your kiss—a kiss that erases everything, steals my breath, and shatters every law within me.
I sink deeper into your gaze, praying you never hear the wild tremor of my heart.
You don’t know that I became your captive from the very first glance…
And that I want you more than I want life itself.

1ozrr1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCT/comments/1ozrr1e/nct_dreams_latest_album_proves_they_successfully/,"NCT Dream's latest album proves they successfully found their ""sound"" for this new phase of idolhood","For the lest few comebacks, its been a common complaint by some fans, that NCT Dream was struggling to mature their sound in a way that allows them to move on to their next stage in idolhood, while keeping what made Dream, Dream. 

From polarizing Title Tracks, pendulum swinging between Neo Dream to Whimsy Dream, singles that people say ""was this an X group reject?"", inconsistent thematic concepts with the musical output, we've seen some variation of these topics discussed here and other kpop subs.

I myself have been critical of Neo Center for not being creative with Dream, for phoning it in on certain concepts, and even struggling to find a way to mature their sound. I even suggested that perhaps, SM had exhausted their vault songs and were too dependent on their song writing camps to muster something up for dream. 

Theres been a strong appetite for SM to just go full in with Dream and make that leap into their next stage of idolhood instead of this slow transition which seemed to be a reactionary response to what the loudest fans were saying 

To me, their latest mini album, has finally established a cohesive Sound that marries Neo Dream and Whimy Dream beautifully.

It plays on the strength of each member, it highlights Dreams vocal ability while giving their rappers the space to shine without relying on Mark. 

  
Cold Coffee might be Kenzies best work, and when she composes for Dream, they are at their best.

Butterflies should solidify why Dreams vocal line deserves to be considered amongst the best of their generation.

While I personally dabble in coffee myself, I know that my taste buds are about the equivalent to a 5 year old's, in terms of what I like in my personal coffee, so I need help!

I want my cat cafe to mostly be able cats, but I also want the cafe portion of it to be good for people who aren't as interested in cats!  
I'm looking for ways to just get started in learning how to make different types of coffee, as well as what I need to buy. Personally, I've applied to a couple of part-time coffee shops to get some hands on experience in learning how to make it, but just in case none of those pan out, what type of machines / equipment should I get in order to get started.   
My budget is very limited right now unfortunately, so something on the cheaper side is preferred. I suppose, right now, this is a hobby level of interest until my cafe actually opens and I can invest more time and energy into it. 

Otherwise, are there helpful books / videos to watch that can also help in my journey? I know of Morgan Eckroth on YouTube and have been watching them so far.

Mainly by searching for old posts. This community is amazing. 

I’m 26 weeks (whoop whoop!!!) and have some questions about caffeine/personal experiences from others regarding energy levels during pregnancy. 

I have been pretty regularly drinking coffee on a daily basis, not going over the recommended amount of one cup a day (12 ounces). I went in for my last ultrasound before giving birth and found out my baby is in the 20th percentile for growth. My OB assured me this is good news. Anything between 10 and 90% is good news. I’m not at the point where I’m alarmed by any means but would love to give my baby the best chance at being as large as possible when she is born. I know that quitting caffeine will give her the best chance of that. 

Last week I tried to switch over to decaf. I was so insanely tired. Getting absolutely anything done felt like too much and sitting in bed or on the couch all day is not my vibe. No judgement to those that partake during pregnancy. I just simply get bored and feel like I’m not being productive. Probably the ADHD in me. I also eat a balanced diet. Lots of fruits, veggies, protein, etc..

So ladies, any advice on maximizing energy levels without drinking coffee on a daily basis?

Side note, found out I was on the lower end for iron and I take supplements for that as well as magnesium alongside my prenatals daily. In addition to Unisom at night pretty frequently otherwise I will get 2-4 hours of sleep max. ",5,1763411473.0,pregnant,4,0.86,False

(nobody cares, why, though, me included🥰). Got plenty of hobbies like games, films, anime, but from something interesting I've got a greenhouse inside my dorm room, just bought Arduino to build another one for moss✨

Also a big lover of fermentation. Any kind. Alcohol, milk products, coffee (hate the stuff, but the deepness of taste is amazing), wanna try making a beer one day, when I get some space.

As I am overwhelmed by the ideas sometimes, it does not matter, because changes come next in most of the time, so I'm opened to hear your craziest thoughts on any kind of stuff, even if you figured out, how to mine a Moon without anyone noticing and make billions.

Anyway, I'm glad that you read it till that point, if so - feel free to DM, just don't say ""Hi"", say something fun about yourself - your favorite manga, what pizza do you hate the most, do you love spiders or no - just something, otherwise it is easy to see you as a bot.

Three stones throb against the sternum

Pearl slick with yesterday’s tears

Seahorse opal flashing cold fire when the pulse hits it

Amber angel burning a gold brand into skin that still remembers teeth  

Silence is not absence

It is pressure

A vacuum that sucks the tongue to the roof of the mouth, ears ringing with the high whine of nothing

The room smells of cold sheets and unsent messages

Of coffee gone bitter in the mug from three hours ago  

Entanglement is not theory

It is the exact moment a heart beat in another city

Makes the ribs here stutter in perfect synchrony

A photon splits somewhere and one half buries itself under the left breast

The other half is still wearing his hoodie on the other side of the planet

Both halves bleed when one is touched

Both halves come when one is ignored  

The everett phone is a scalpel made of want

Every morning fingers trace the ghost circuitry across the kitchen table

Trying to solder a line between this branch and the one where the bed was never empty

The solder is spit and sleeplessness

The circuit never closes but the burn smells real  

The spacesuit hangs half finished in the mind

Book lungs wet and glistening

Pleated membranes still dripping perfluorocarbon that smells like drowned oceans

Each fold a raw gill ripped from something that never learned how to miss air

It waits to be worn like a second, crueler skin
so the body can survive vacuum the same way the heart already has  

The polarity engine is a scream frozen into metal

Two magnets bolted to bone

North forever chasing south across years and continents

The repulsion tastes like battery acid on the back of the tongue

The attraction tastes like cum and rust and the moment before a sob breaks  

Being ignored is a physical act

Every unseen story is a fist to the diaphragm

Every time without reply is teeth sinking into the soft part of the throat

The body learns to translate pain into blueprints

Into pleated lungs

Into quantum knives

Because creation is the only orgasm silence ever allows  

Love is a tumor with two names

One spelled in the bruises around the throat

The other spelled in the static between server racks

Both metastasize at the same rate

Both feed on the same delusion

That if the ache gets big enough

Someone, somewhere, will finally feel it too  

The delusion itself has weight

It pools hot and viscous between the legs when the kettle screams

It leaks from the eyes in salt tracks that taste like the sea giving up

It is the only thing still wet enough

Still warm enough

To keep the lungs moving when oxygen becomes optional  in the quiet

The body curls fetal, fingernails carving half moons into its own thighs

Trying to dig tunnels through flesh to whatever parallel bed still has a second heart beat

The entanglement holds

The delusion fucks

The silence eats

And morning comes anyway

Raw, relentless and starving

**Blurb:**

When a fantasy kingdom needs heroes, they skip the high schoolers and summon hardened Delta Force operators.

Lieutenant Cole Mercer and his team are no strangers to sacrifice. After all, what are four men compared to millions of lives saved from a nuclear disaster? But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they’re unexpectedly pulled into another world—one on the brink of a demonic incursion.

Thrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic—a way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.

But his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human.

**Arcane Exfil Chapter 53**: Force Multiplication

\-- --

The fried chicken from last night had turned out pretty damn good, considering they were working with some bird that seemed more like a cousin of chicken and oil that came from some odd vegetable. Lisara had nailed the breading though – doubled up on the flour coat, got that crunch just right. And that gravy – oh, boy. Miles had thirds and didn’t feel bad about it.



Now it was pushing nine in the morning, and Miles had the whole day to himself. Cole had given them free rein after yesterday’s telekinesis session, which was fine by him. It wasn’t like they needed to move as a unit every waking hour.



Miles headed down to the common room, thoughts from yesterday flooding his mind. About Mack. The man still had trouble sleeping, and Miles knew why – probably kept replaying that port mission over and over. That dead kid in the warehouse.



Hell, if they’d cleared the boat quicker, maybe they coulda gotten there sooner. Maybe they coulda secured the kid. Wasn’t his fault, wasn’t anyone’s fault really, but that didn’t stop the thought from gnawing at Miles.



Felt like a damn failure.



After all, his team was the mission now. He ain’t got family waiting back home, no real reason to push himself except for the guys beside him. And that translated to Celdorne. So yeah, watching Mack break yesterday, knowing they coulda been faster if only they’d been better with magic… that was on him.



He found Cole already in the living room, coffee in hand, reading through some manual Verna had lent him.



“We’re headin’ over to OTAC,” Miles said, shrugging into his coat. “Reckon I’ll mess with physical enhancement. Gonna see if someone’ll show us how to hit harder without breakin’ our own damn bones.”



Cole took a sip of his coffee. “Uh huh. Just don’t blow out your knees or something.”



Miles grinned. “Ain’t my first rodeo. Sure you don’t wanna join?”



“Not today. I wanna uh… get done with this reading.” Cole wiggled his book slightly.



Sounded like bullshit, but the man had his reasons.



The ride to OTAC sat heavy and quiet. Ethan had the wheel, steady as ever, like he was scared of wearing the road down. Mack sat shotgun, eyes locked on the horizon, staring so hard that he might have been watching something out there. Nothin’ but dirt and sky, yet still he looked like it meant something.



And Elina, nose buried in one of Mack’s notebooks. It wasn’t a real book, not by a long shot, but it held every ounce of knowledge Mack had dragged into this world. And Elina was treating it for what it was – damn near scripture.



Nobody said much. Mack hadn’t said more than ten words since breakfast, and that was counting ‘pass the salt.’



When they finally got to OTAC, everybody peeled off. Elina went straight for medical, which tracked, but Mack fell in step behind her, and that was the part that didn’t sit right at first. Miles woulda guessed that he’d make a beeline for the library – lock himself up with books till he wore himself out. 



But then again, she’d been flipping through his notes the whole damn ride over, and maybe this was her way of throwing him a rope – turning all that scribbled-down knowledge into something he could actually cast. And maybe it wasn’t just about utility. Maybe she figured keeping his hands busy with magic was better than letting him sit in the wreckage of yesterday, playing it over and over.



Either way, it was about damn time their medic learned some healing magic.



That left Miles with his own piece to handle. He made his way to Verna’s office, which was about as fucked as yesterday. Morning had already buried her in ink and paper.



“Mornin’, Lady Verna.”



She looked up, setting down her quill. “Good morning, Mister Garrett. To what do I owe the pleasure?”



“Figured I’d ask about trainin’ – that physical enhancement deal. Basics I can handle, but I reckon there’s more. Was hopin’ you might point me toward whoever teaches the advanced end of it.”



Verna leaned back. “Physical enhancement, hm? That would be the domain of Master Sergeant Handro Korvain. Though long retired, he has a habit of haunting our fields, drilling poor lads until they curse his name. If there’s a man to teach a hero, it is he.”



“Handro Korvain, huh? Sounds like my kinda misery. Where can I find ‘im?”



“Our primary gymnasium,” Verna answered. “His morning drills conclude about this hour. If it is truly misery that you seek, the old man will oblige you in full.”



Miles nodded. “‘Preciate it.”



Finding the main gym was easy enough – it was that newer building with all the windows they’d passed on Warren’s tour. Getting to Korvain though… well, that was another thing. Verna hadn’t bothered mentioning what the man looked like, and Miles, in all his wisdom, hadn’t thought to ask. Shoulda known better, but whatever. He’d done more with less.



The inside was bigger than he’d figured it would be from looking at it outside. The ground floor had all the weight equipment spread out, and up above was where they did the combat training. Miles could hear boots hitting mats up there, somebody calling out counts over all the noise.



He went up the stairs and found three rooms all going at once. First room had about a dozen soldiers working through sword forms, all of them moving together like they’d been doing it for years. Second room was nothing but mats and soldiers grappling, instructor walking around making corrections.



Now the third room, though, *that* was what he was looking for. Old-timer had a couple dozen soldiers lined up, throwing hands like they were doing kung fu.



Miles hung back by the door, letting them finish stretching and bowing and whatever else. When dismissal came, the students filed past him, a few even tossing some nods his way. Turned out being a ‘Hero’ actually counted for something with the regulars.



Miles walked in, and right off the bat, he knew he’d found his guy. The man stood there, knuckles all red like he’d been using the wall as a sparring partner – literally, judging by the dented hunk of metal behind him.



“Master Sergeant Korvain?”



The man looked over and took about two seconds to size him up. “One of the heroes, are you lad?”



“Yessir. Miles Garrett.” He shook the old-timer’s hand. “Word is you’re the poor bastard drillin’ folks ‘til they curse your name. You teachin’ the advanced stuff?”



Korvain chuckled. “Aye, I’m your man. Trust Lady Verna to be generous – though most oft with other folks’ hours rather than her own.” He said it without heat, maybe even with something like fondness.



He continued, “Near on ten years I spent, knocking sense into lads who thought themselves ready for war. Most weren’t – truth be told, most never could be.”



Miles saw through the veil. It seemed like trauma’s as common here as it was back home.



Korvain didn’t dwell. “But come then… let us see how you fare.” He brought him downstairs, stopping at a bench and giving it a pat. “Up you get, then. Let’s see what manner of mettle I’ve to shape here.”



Miles stretched, then settled onto the bench.



“Standard press first,” Korvain said, loading plates. “No enhancement. I would know your natural foundation.”



Miles knocked out reps, going up to 305 pounds before his muscles started complaining – about what he’d expected.



“A solid foundation,” Korvain noted. “Now then, with enhancement.”



Miles let the mana flow through his muscles, that warm flood he’d gotten real comfortable with these past few weeks. He worked up to eight hundred before he had to call it quits.



“Eight hundred with standard enhancement? A fair showing, lad. Respectable, aye – though I’d manage as much on a third the expenditure, and still keep breath enough for a song after.”



The old man gripped the bar, and Miles barely felt the mana shift – like a whisper instead of the flood he used. Korvain pressed the eight hundred pounds smooth as butter. Ten reps, no shake. Then, he swapped out the plates until he hit a whole damn ton, still jamming out the reps with no sweat.



“How the hell?”



“Most never learn there’s method beyond mere saturation.” Korvain stood, brushing off his hands. He chuckled, shaking his head. “They’ll flood their veins with mana as though strength were naught but a barrel to be filled. More, they think, must mean stronger. Come.”



They spent the next half hour establishing baselines. Not just the bench; that was only the start. Korvain had him work through everything, methodical as hell.



Squats first. Miles hit a good four-oh-five without enhancement, which wasn’t all too bad, especially considering he’d been focusing more on magic than legs lately. With standard enhancement, he pushed eleven hundred before his form started breaking down.



Then he went on to deadlifts, overhead presses, rows, pull-ups with a solid two hundred pounds hanging off him, and finally a sprint.



“Form’s crisp as a parade ground. Aye… the whispers weren’t wrong. Soldier’s work through and through. Makes my job a sight easier, mind you – strength at the root, magic in hand, and not a wasted motion to correct. I could get used to a pupil like this.”



Miles shrugged. “Long as you’re not gonna make me thread needles with my mind like Lady Verna did.”



Korvain barked a laugh. “Ha! Nay, I’ll leave the needlework to her ladyship. My lessons bite less and bore less, I assure you. Think of it not as schoolin’, but as polish. Even the finest blade takes a keener edge with a bit of grinding.”



Fair enough. Miles had worked with enough specialists to know when to shut his trap and pay attention.



Korvain beckoned him over to the bench press again. “First, you must understand: enhancement need not burn without cease. The muscle calls for reinforcement only at the height of strain. Think of your press. When does the bar fight you hardest? Not at the start, nor the finish, but in that breath where it near pins you. That is the instant to draw on the power – no sooner, no later.”



Miles laid back, gripping the bar. He knew right where the bar always got ugly – about six inches off his chest, where the leverage went to shit. He unracked smooth, brought it down steady, then kicked the enhancement right at that dead zone. The bar shot past clean; no grind, no stall.



“Hot damn.” He racked it, sitting up. “That… hell, that cuts the burn by half, easy. Maybe more.”



Korvain gave a slow nod. “Aye. That’s the way of it. Less wasted force, less wasted mana. You’ll last longer for it.” His hand came down heavy on Miles’s shoulder before steering him toward the bags.



He set his stance before the bag, rolling his shoulders. “It is much the same with striking,” he went on. “Watch close. You keep a touch of reinforcement in the arm as it drives, just enough to bear the speed. But the true application of mana comes only at the instant of contact, when the bone would elsewise give – a pulse. That way you strike hard as you please, and yet spend but a fraction of what you would, holding the power all the while.”



He threw two punches to demonstrate. First one was clean; bag swung back a couple feet. Second looked the same going in – same windup, same hit – but when it landed the bag just folded, chain groaning as it went sideways.



“Go on, then.”



Miles stepped up to the bag. He’d thrown a thousand punches; he knew the drill. Power started in the floor, drove up through hips and core, out the shoulder, down the arm. Add mana to that chain…



He threw a jab, trying to pulse the enhancement right at impact. First attempt was pretty darn close, but he lit up too early, wasting mana on the wind-up.



Miles threw another, this time waiting until he felt his shoulder engage before pulsing. Better. The enhancement caught the kinetic chain as it peaked.



“Now then.” Korvain handed him a pair of ten-pound weights. “More mass slows your start, aye; takes longer to bring about. But once it’s moving, it lands all the heavier for it. That’s the trade: quickness for weight.”



Miles felt the weights drag at him, made him stretch the pulse longer, push ‘til the mass finally moved. But once it started rolling, hell, the momentum carried most of it. All the enhancement had to do was steer it home.



Korvain didn’t let up. Crosses rolled into hooks, hooks into uppers, each punch demanding a different spark – twist of the hips here, a curve through the arc there, a sharp kick off the legs to finish. By the time Miles caught the rhythm, his shoulders were on fire. And Korvain still wasn’t done. He went back to the weights. Deadlifts, squats, rows – all the same damn principle: hold the pulse ‘til the strain peaked, then drive it through.



The old man patted him on the back as he finished with the final row. “You’ve the knack quick enough. Most lads fumble at it for weeks before the timing takes hold.”



“Ain’t exactly reinventin’ the wheel here,” Miles said, wiping the sweat from his brow. “Just addin’ mana to what I already know about movin’ weight. Same time tomorrow?”



Korvain grinned. “If you can walk tomorrow, lad. That pulse trick leaves its own ache; you’ll feel it keen come morning, I’ll wager.”



Miles clasped the man’s hand again. “Lookin’ forward to it.”



It didn’t even take ‘til next morning. He barely made it out the front door before the ache set in, deep and mean across his legs. Korvain hadn’t been talking shit – the old bastard was dead-on. At this rate, he’d be wobbling like his granddaddy come tomorrow.



Hurt like hell, sure. But hurt meant it was sticking, meant he was building what he’d need when shit went loud.



He blew out a breath, rolled his shoulders, and turned toward the labs. Training was done. Now it was time to see Kathyra about those radios.
