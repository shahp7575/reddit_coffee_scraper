They didn't respond at the time in any way, being speechless, and I did not press the topic further.

Instead of distancing themselves however, like I feared, the frequency of our discussions and meet ups increased (some ups and downs due to work load)

The last two days however, texting went way up. They were pretty sick until yesterday, so I was just checking in and that turned into 4 hour texting sessions two days in a row. Throughout those talks they initiated topics as soon as one discussion came to a close. Our conversations were never one sided, however them promoting a new topic out of the blue like that is new.

We didn't talk about ""relationship-stuff"", but the topics are quite heavy, emotionaly intimate and taxing at times. Though the vibe did remain quite uplifting throughout all due to us making jokes along they way and being supportive.

At the end they reminded me of and formally invited me to a party which we talked about earlier. Due to me attending an event with a shared friend group I'm not able to attend though. I did however offer my help in prepping for the party (mostly cooking) before leaving for said event.

They accepted with thanks, did however state that we could also just go for some coffee at their place instead.

My question now is, is this something to read into? 

Normally I wouldn't due to us being friends, but I told them about my feelings and every time we meet up, I think, it's pretty obvious that I'm still very much interested in them.

They were in a long term relationship until last year. I don't know if that's entirely relevant, though I believe that would change your priorities in terms of pursuing another relationship/checking for red flags and such. (i.e. good friend may not equal good partner)

TL;DR, My friend that knows I have feelings for them suddenly inceases the length and frequency of our conversations and kinda asked me to meet them 1on1 before a party for coffee. Is that still normal friend behaviour in this situation?",1,1729131814.0,dating,1,1.0,False

My Jr Admin pings me this morning, while I'm still in bed and the coffee pot hasn't even started brewing, ""I thought the quarterly release wasn't supposed to be live until tomorrow. Is this right?"" Sends a screenshot of a specific feature from the release (that I'd planned to disable the second it was live) clearly visible to our entire user base. 

Thankfully, he knew to ping me before working hours on something like that, and we were able to quickly disable it mostly before anyone noticed. Of course a few did, but their complaints got them volun-told onto the beta-test team for next week. (My status: Still in pajamas).

My day was supposed to be final testing and sending training comms out. Instead, it was crash implementation/config since the rest of the features couldn't be rolled back. Figure out who is most likely to flip out first, get them the launch deck quickest, lather, rinse, repeat. Vendor gaslights me and claims they 'always launch a day early....'. 

Until about noon, when one of my power users asks a totally unrelated question about system access for one of his clients. Access which has -100% to do with this launch since client users can't see any of these features.

...except, they can, which I found in testing his unrelated question. Not only can they see them, even though I disabled them globally, they can take edit actions that their read-only permission sets don't allow. Queue my second support call for the day.

So now the hundreds of genuinely frustrated users with unexpected new UI layouts take a backseat to a security risk analysis. Thankfully, the edit feature is also broken, so it TELLS them the change was made but doesn't actually make it. (My status: STILL pajamas, but now coffee). Back-channel peers at other companies about the issue so they can dogpile tlon my support ticket.

Several unrelated support tickets roll in, asking if I can quickly make my platform intercept Death Star missles and use them to mirror the Disney fireworks show ...by tomorrow. (Um. No. Also, WTF?)

Internal support channel blips: ""Is <system> down for anyone else?"" Me: *clickyclicky* F************ck ""Yes, system is down completely."" Third support call to vendor. Teach Jr Admin phrase, 'Some days, you're the windshield. Some days, you're the bug.'

Continue drafting training emails while vendor scrambles. System comes back up. My vain hopes of a release rollback die miserably, and the security hole still exists. (4pm, still pajamas, now into Monster/Celcius highballs)

All of this is an unusually bad day, but...we don't cure cancer. We aren't first responders, nobody is bleeding, everybody is breathing. I am frustrated and grumpy that my nice phased rollout got blown to hell, but c'est la vie.

Until my husband gets home, and mentions that this morning he had to throw away the brand new box of very nice gourmet cookies that were on the counter because apparently we have ants. We hadn't even tried two of them! I have found the insects that broke the sys-admins back. Finally manage to explain that I'm not actually crying over the cookies, before he drives an hour each way to go get more.

Status: 10pm, no pajamas, 3rd glass of port. No cookies. üòû

Realizing all of the episodes of Stargate sg1, Atlantis, and universe, extrapolate a pilot for the first episode of a sci fi parody series that is comedic in nature.

## **Stargate: Galaxy Farts**

**Pilot Episode: ""Wormhole Wednesday""**

**Scene 1: The SGC**

*Colonel Jack O'Neill, now a grizzled and slightly senile veteran, is sitting at his desk, sipping a cup of coffee.*

**O'Neill:** ""Alright, Carter, let's see what's on the docket for today. Ah, yes. Wormhole Wednesday. Just what I needed to spice up my life.""

*Dr. Samantha Carter, now a middle-aged woman with a penchant for bad puns, enters the room.*

**Carter:** ""Colonel, have you heard the latest? The Goa'uld are planning to launch a massive attack on Earth using a new weapon: the Death Ray 2.0. It's basically a really powerful laser pointer.""

**O'Neill:** (Chuckling) ""A laser pointer? That's it? We're supposed to be scared of a laser pointer?""

*General Hammond, now a doddering old man, enters the room.*

**Hammond:** ""Gentlemen, gentlemen. We must take this threat seriously. I've assembled a team of our finest. Let's meet them in the briefing room.""

**Scene 2: The Briefing Room**

*The team is assembled, including Teyla Emmagan, now a fitness guru, John Sheppard, now a washed-up actor, and Daniel Jackson, now a conspiracy theorist.*

**Hammond:** ""This is our mission. We must travel through the Stargate to the planet P3X-887 and stop the Goa'uld from activating the Death Ray 2.0.""

**Carter:** ""But, General, that planet is known for its extreme flatulence. The air is so foul, it could knock a Goa'uld out cold.""

**O'Neill:** (Excitedly) ""Flatulence? That's even better! Let's do it!""

**Scene 3: Planet P3X-887**

*The team arrives on the planet, which is covered in giant, farting cows.*

**Sheppard:** ""This place smells... awful.""

**Teyla:** (Noses the air) ""I sense... a disturbance in the Force.""

*Suddenly, a giant Goa'uld appears, holding the Death Ray 2.0.*

**Goa'uld:** ""You cannot stop me! I will destroy Earth with my powerful laser pointer!""

*O'Neill, Carter, and Hammond look at each other, then at the Goa'uld.*

**O'Neill:** ""Well, we can't just stand here and let him do that. Let's show him what we're made of.""

*The team charges at the Goa'uld, but instead of fighting, they start farting at him. The Goa'uld is overwhelmed by the stench and collapses.*

**O'Neill:** ""Well, that was... unexpected.""

*The team returns to Earth, victorious. As they celebrate, Hammond turns to O'Neill.*

**Hammond:** ""Colonel, I think we've found our new mission. From now on, we're going to be known as the Stargate Flatulence Force.""

**O'Neill:** (Grinning) ""I like the sound of that.""



Draft 2:



## **Stargate: Galaxy Farce**

**Pilot Episode: ""Wormhole Wednesday""**

**Scene 1: The SGC**

*The SGC is bustling as usual, but with a decidedly more comedic atmosphere. Colonel Jack O'Neill is sitting at his desk, sipping coffee and reading the newspaper.*

**O'Neill:** (muttering to himself) ""Another day, another alien invasion. I swear, these Goa'uld are getting lazier by the year.""

*Samantha Carter walks in, looking flustered.*

**Carter:** Jack, we've got a new dialing-in. It's a planet called ""Planet Hollywood.""

**O'Neill:** (rolls his eyes) ""Great. Now we're dealing with the Kardashians of the galaxy.""

*Teal'c and Daniel Jackson enter, looking equally unimpressed.*

**Teal'c:** ""This is a waste of my time.""

**Daniel:** ""Perhaps we could use this opportunity to study the culture of Hollywood. It might be enlightening.""

**Scene 2: Planet Hollywood**

*The team arrives on Planet Hollywood, a gaudy, over-the-top planet filled with neon lights and giant statues of celebrities. A holographic Elvis Presley greets them.*

**Elvis:** (singing) ""Welcome to my beautiful, beautiful world!""

*The team is immediately overwhelmed by the sensory overload. Carter starts taking pictures, Teal'c is trying to figure out if there are any Jaffa here, and Daniel is trying to decipher the local language, which is mostly movie quotes.*

**O'Neill:** (to himself) ""This is worse than the Tok'ra.""

*Suddenly, a giant, inflatable replica of the Statue of Liberty appears, and a voice booms over a loudspeaker.*

**Voice:** ""Attention, Earthlings! You are now under the control of the Galactic Glitterati!""

*A group of aliens dressed in sequined jumpsuits and wearing sunglasses appear. They are led by a flamboyant alien named ""Glitterman.""*

**Glitterman:** ""We demand you surrender your planet's supply of popcorn and celebrity gossip!""

**O'Neill:** (sighs) ""Of course.""

*The team reluctantly agrees to give up the planet's supply of popcorn. As they leave, Glitterman waves goodbye.*

**Glitterman:** ""And remember, Earthlings, always strive to be more fabulous!""

*The team returns to the SGC, looking exhausted but relieved. As they walk away, O'Neill turns back and looks at the planet.*

**O'Neill:** ""Well, at least it wasn't the Ori.""



Draft 3:



## **Stargate: Galaxy Quest**

**Episode Title:** ""The Quest for the Ultimate MacGuffin""

**Scene 1: The Command Room**
* **General Jack O'Neill:** (in a deadpan voice) ""Well, this is a new one. We've got a message from a planet called 'Krypton'.""
* **Dr. Daniel Jackson:** (excitedly) ""Krypton? That's impossible! It's a myth!""
* **Samantha Carter:** (rolls her eyes) ""Or maybe it's just another planet with a weird name.""
* **Colonel Teal'c:** (in his usual monotone) ""I do not understand.""

**Scene 2: The Message**
* A holographic projection of a Superman-like figure appears.
* **The Kryptonian:** ""Greetings, Earthlings. We are in dire need of your assistance. A powerful artifact, the 'MacGuffin', has been stolen by the evil Lord Business.""

**Scene 3: The Team Prepares**
* **O'Neill:** ""So, we're basically in a movie now?""
* **Carter:** ""Looks like it. And I'm pretty sure the MacGuffin is a plot device.""
* **Jackson:** (dreamily) ""But it's so exciting! Adventure, aliens, and... a MacGuffin!""
* **Teal'c:** (confused) ""What is a 'MacGuffin'?""

**Scene 4: The Planet of Business**
* The team arrives on a planet that looks like a giant office building.
* **O'Neill:** ""This place is... corporate.""
* **Business Executives:** (in unison) ""Welcome to Business Planet! We can help you with all your business needs.""
* **Carter:** ""I think we're supposed to be fighting a villain, not buying office supplies.""

**Scene 5: The Showdown**
* Lord Business, a stereotypical villain with a bad suit, confronts the team.
* **Business:** ""The MacGuffin is mine! It will make me the most powerful being in the universe!""
* **O'Neill:** (sarcastically) ""Wow, that's a real power grab. A *business* power grab.""
* **A climactic battle ensues, filled with ridiculous special effects and over-the-top dialogue.**

**Scene 6: The Resolution**
* The team defeats Lord Business and retrieves the MacGuffin.
* **O'Neill:** ""Well, that was... something.""
* **Carter:** ""I think we need a vacation.""
* **Jackson:** ""But what about the MacGuffin? What do we do with it?""
* **Teal'c:** ""Perhaps we should sell it on eBay.""

*The episode ends with a montage of the team's misadventures, including a dance-off with aliens and a cameo from the cast of *Galaxy Quest*. The final shot is of the team standing in front of the Stargate, looking exhausted but satisfied.*

Currently we have 2 old school original Sonos 1's. We don't listen to our music or TV super loud, but do like it to sound great at lower volumes. Dolby Atmos not too important for us for music, but curious about it for movies.  I have found our house to be a bit tricky with its acoustics due its vault and hard surfaces. There are two spaces we are considering:

Kitchen/dining/living space:

This space is 28x24 and has large vaulted ceilings and hard surfaces like the windows. I've tried having the speakers lower down but found the sound got jumbled from the vault. Currently the Sonos 1's are located up in the loft over the kitchen pointing towards the windows and the sounds seems ok.

* Wondering what would be best for this space?
* Any recommendations on placement for a vault like this besides from the loft?
* A pair of 5s? Stick with the 1's? Something else?
* Would a sub help?

Rec room:

The space is L shaped, with the TV area being 12x24. Pretty standard, 65 inch tv with couch about 8-9 feet from the TV. Would love surrounds, only worry is I don't have too much space behind the couch due to the walk way. There is a rug under the couch/coffee table, but the rest of the room has concrete floors. We have to be a bit mindful of sound with the kids rooms down the hallway (there is a door to the hallway, and not sharing any walls). Was thinking Arc Ultra, Sub 4, Era 300's surrounds, but maybe overkill?

* Can the surrounds be right up next to the back of the couch or should the be a bit further back?
* Would era 300's be over kill for the space or work well?
* Any other advice for this space?

I‚Äôm not sure if the pain is enough for me to head to the hospital. I am able to sit here just fine but the pain is annoying - like I need to pass gas or I‚Äôm cramping like on my period. But, if it‚Äôs a stuck stone, I‚Äôm nervous to just sit here and wait.

1g5gcex,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1g5gcex/got_cheated_again_for_the_2nd_time/,Got cheated again for the 2nd time.,"My girlfriend (F20) admitted 3 days ago that she cheated on me again last week. This is the second time she cheated. Ang masaklap pa don, kilala ko yung guy and she had a history with him, which makes it worst.

She said she did that because of frustration na I can't give what she wants. I always give her time even though I'm busy sa acads but lately, punong puno talaga ang mga gawain ko pero never ako nagkulang sa updates, Im giving her the emotional support she needs, and I'm always beside her on tough times. 

I asked calmly, bat sa dinami dami ng lalake, yung exact guy na yon pa talaga. She said she wanted to hurt me so badly. They were planning to meet for a cup of coffee, but I doubt na there's more into that. Luckily it never happened. She said na I can't blame her at inubos ko daw siya kaya if necessary, sa iba niya daw hahanapin yung shortcomings ko. 

After some pep talk, we acted like we never had that conversation ang get on with our lives. Pero deep inside, durog na durog ako. I did everything for her, I was there during her tough times, but everytime lagi niya pinapamuka sakin mga mistakes ko even the ones from before, sobrang sakit because I never felt na she acknowledged my efforts, and telling me she did more efforts than me. Wala siyang narinig sakin na kahit anong masasakit na salita but I endured all of those verbal abuse.

Last night, I was accompanying her kasi nawawalan siya ng gana magaral lately, and fortunately I persuaded her to do so. In the middle of her study session, she felt sorry for what she did. She said she will do anything to regain her trust. I said I already forgave her, and we should move forward na. Pero I can't tell her na nasasaktan pa din ako sa ginawa niya. I love her so much, pero di ko siya maiwan. The first time she cheated on me, she begged kasi I wanna leave her na but idk I trusted her again kahit mahirap and accepted her again wholeheartedly.

She was sweet to me lately, showering me with updates, pero ako eto iniisip padin yung ginawa niya. Tinatry ko ireciprocate yung actions niya kahit mahirap kasi I know she would be mad at me again pag naging cold ako. Onti onti nako nawawalan ng gana, pero deep inside I'm still expecting na she would change. 

For the meantime, I'll try to trust her again, but most prob leave her soon enough na bc of this heavy feeling na I can't even address to her bc she would be mad at me everytime na nagoopen ako sakanya about my feelings. So I'll just leave it here, thanks for reading.",1,1729131148.0,OffMyChestPH,16,0.6,False

I am commenting/documenting views we have in our database and I am so lost on this specific view. I have never seen a join into a date range and am quite puzzled by it. As well as there's some math involving dates that I can't wrap my head around for some reason but I probably just need some more coffee - although some help/advice with it would be much appreciated. Anyways here it is:

`Left Join`

`table1.Date1`

`ON`

`table1.Date1 > table2.Date2`

`AND table1.Date1 < table2.Date3`

With this I'm confused what exactly is being left joined. Is Date1 being joined by matching data from the Date2 and Date3 table IF their respective info falls within that date range? Or are Date2 and Date3 being matched by data in Date1 IF it's data falls within this range. There is no key = key match that I am accustomed to with joins.



`date1 < GETDATE() + 7 - DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) + 1`

With this what trips me up is going from a DD/MM/YYYY and DD format. Date1 is in DD/MM/YYYY, you add 7 (days?) to today (10/16/2024), then subtract by the days value (today is wednesday so it would be 4) so we get 10/19/2024? Or is it just 19? Then you add one so its 10/20/2024 or just 20? Then is it okay to compare dates if they are in different formats?

The truth is, I'm really far from okay. A series of bad life decisions and hardships over the years has completely destroyed my mental health.

 I'm in my early 20s, and I have no in person friends. Next to no relationship with my parents. I lost my job and can barely get up off my ass to look for a new one. I sit and play my favorite videos games all day and night, eat, sleep and repeat.

The games and my pet are all that keeps me going anymore. The terrible thing is, I yell at my pet when he gets needy or loud, and then I feel even more terrible afterwards.

I've hurt a lot of people. Some of them care about me, or did at one time. I've hurt myself, time and time again, whether it be financially or through drug and alcohol abuse.

I can't take it anymore. People say death isn't the answer, well what is? I've hospitalized myself, only to be given black coffee and some other crazy people to talk to. I've tried therapy, but I'm too closed off to benefit from it. Medicine hasn't worked either.

Most people don't really care about you when you struggle like this. The ones that do, at the end of the day they have their own lives to worry about.

I can't live anymore thinking about the things I've done and the people I've hurt. I just can't do it

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe it's a final attempt at help or just a place to let it out. It might get removed anyway.

I've got a plan, and I intend on seeing it through. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like this anymore. I know I'll just hurt more people by doing it, but they'll get over it. Life goes on

If you're reading this, I hope you've never felt like this. If you have, I hope it gets better

Me ‚ÄòF-18‚Äô and my partner ‚ÄòM-18‚Äô have been dating for a little over a year. A couple months into the year , we had are first huge argument. 

I showed him a message i didn‚Äôt know how to respond to, since he told me he didn‚Äôt want me texting guys, friend or not at all. The message was some random question, but then he began to scroll and go through my account and freaked out because there was a lot of messages with me and two guy mutual a. I urged him to read them all, as all of the messages were platonic as they were just online mutuals i acquired though covid. However, one of them complimented me a year or so ago and that made him even angrier.

long story short he yelled at me for multiple days and it ended with me jumping off his car 50 times in order for him to forgive me and know i care (it‚Äôs my first relationship i know now ‚Ä¶pls spare me.) but since then it‚Äôs been very rocky and either intensely hot and happy or extremely cold and horrible arguements. they‚Äôve slowed down a little, but last for longer amounts of time, which brings us to monday.

He was upset because i told him to ‚Äúgrow up and learn how to communicate‚Äù on sunday. So on monday i showed up and surprised him, and took him for coffee (which he insisted he paid, but i still sent money for). we had a great night and then an awkward instance in the bedroom id rather not get into. That night i called him and told him it left me feeling very sad and awkward. and he said ok sorry. I prod him for conversation and ask him why he isn‚Äôt even making an effort to speak to me after i just shared something heavy. he says that he was upset that i told him ‚Äúthe lyrics of his songs could be more consistent‚Äù and said that it embarrassed him, so i needed to block him on his music account. I was very hurt by this because i bought him a mic, attempted to write his lyrics, and discussed algorithm and ways to help him many time regardless of the fact that he initially hid the account from me out of embarrassment.

I told him this, and he completely flipped. about how i don‚Äôt care about him, never do anything to support him, don‚Äôt listen and i will never understand anything. All the whilst i‚Äôm apologizing and telling him I love him, he blocks me on everything. The next morning he sends flowers and is apologetic, i thanked him and we‚Äôve had limited contact.Tonight, i just look at his account through another (since i‚Äôm blocked) out of curiosity. There are multiple comments from girls which he‚Äôs liked (which is something we‚Äôve talked about me being uncomfortable with and that he said he would never do again) before. and the last time he posted was 2h, then 4h, then a day so he never even took a break while this all was happening. And the most recently liked comment was today.

What do I even do? I told him that I wish him the best with the account and I love him and sorry i couldn‚Äôt be enough for him, but that‚Äôs pretty open ended. Is it over?  I feel so sick but empty at the same time in my stomach. I know this isn‚Äôt how it should be, but this is my first time experiencing love and it‚Äôs so crazy.

im in a boxing gym now, and its impressive how respectful the guys are. i was so used to being stuck in SA and harassment situations.

i was just a cute little thing of lust for him. but i hope his conscience eats him alive. for all the lies, the manipulation

and yes i hate myself for letting him use me and falling so low.

a man with a damaged mind looking at 14 year old with shorts, who befriends an 18 year old still in highschool and her friend and tries to make other girls jealous, who acts like their friend knowing better than that is not a good person.

I have been hosting for 5 months. So far, I've only hosted about 7 or 8 times. I only have 4 reviews -- all of them 5 stars. My property is a rustic cabin that was built in the 80s. It could use some updating eventually, but it's very well maintained. I think my pictures are accurate and it's priced accordingly. I also mention in my listing the possibility of encountering bugs, rodents, and etc, because it's a dang cabin in the woods that goes periods without being occupied. I did mouse mitigation recently with steel wool and foam. I don't like using poison for mice, since I allow pets and have dogs myself. The property borders a national park, has a beautiful creek flowing through it, stocked ponds, walking distance to multiple popular trailheads, all on 5 acres. I offer a lot of amenities inside like books, record player, board games, telescope, fishing pole, star link, tv, and old Edison player, free charcoal, coffee, free firewood, etc, etc. It's a pretty special property. My most recent guest had zero reviews, and I had to approve the booking request. Not having generated a lot of revenue, I was happy to get a new booking, but my Spidey senses were tingling. He initially asked a lot of questions that would have been answered if he read the full listing, and then followed up with more and more questions as his booking date approached, which I answered all cordially and quickly. I just thought he might've been a little higher maintenance than usual. I left him a bottle of wine and a handwritten note welcoming him. He then checked in an hour early almost running into my cleaner (I just have a simple lock box - I probably should get a smart lock instead). He asked tons of questions during his stay, and then messaged me to tell me he tried to light my electric candles with a lighter and melted them. I told him it wasn't a big deal at all and not to worry. He said he was enjoying the cabin, but then proceeds to complain about things like my bathroom not having a door stopper, a light bulb being out (it is really, really well-lit inside, so it wasn't an issue), and then says he spotted a field mouse inside, and used the term ""sneak preview"" when mentioning it, but I think English might be a 2nd language, so not sure if it was meant to be passive aggressive. He was otherwise cordial in pointing things out, and while I'm sure some were valid, it felt so nitpicky and high maintenance. He left a review, and I'm worried he already popped my 5-star cherry.

I let the medication sit out for about 45 minutes & chose the stomach for my site. No pain with injection üéâMild bruising at the site but I am on blood thinners so it doesn‚Äôt surprise me.
Side effects: I am a little nauseous but nothing I can‚Äôt handle. I took Benadryl yesterday after my injection because my other injectable gives me a really bad skin reaction. 
Is it working? To be honest I am not sure. I still have cravings for sugar which is my downfall but they seem a bit less.

1g5fix0,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1g5fix0/i_wasnt_expecting_transphobes_at_a_chappell_roan/,I wasn't expecting transphobes at a Chappell Roan show :/,"I'm having a rough time right now and need to vent, but could also probably use some advice if anyone cares to read my long post.

Background is I'm coming up on nine months hrt and finally seeing some real changes. I've been socially transitioning with family and friends but not work yet. I mostly boy mode in public. I've been presenting femme in safe spaces such as trans socials, gay bars, queer coffee shops, and raves. I've been getting more confident and felt ready to fully transition soon.

So I got a ticket for a music fest and didn't have anyone to go with. I was mainly going to see Chapell Roan, Dom Dolla, and Sturgill Simpson. I dressed pretty androgynous with short shorts, tank top, sneakers. However this being a Chapell show I femmed it up a bit with jewelry and some light makeup. I really wasn't expecting a bunch of transphobes.

At Chapell there was this teenage girl just staring a hole in me. Then the looks from a group of teens in front of me. Looks of fear and disgust. I moved around a bit and ended up near some people who seemed cool and enjoyed the show. One lady smiled and blew me a kiss.

At Dom Dolla it was a much cooler crowd. I found a crew flying a rainbow flag and hung out by them. Mostly positive interactions but I did get some puzzled looks from even the gay guys. The beautiful women dancing with the gays rolled her eyes at me.

Now Sturgill is country but he is liberal and sings about psychedelics and such. I guess the church ladies didn't get the memo. This one lady was giving me the death stare. She was so angry that I would dare stand within site of her children. Tells her husband, then they are both staring. Another couple looks upset with my presence and walk away.

Now I was on some substances that had me looking all sweaty, but I really don't think that was it. It's just crazy how I could wear the same outfit in boymode no problem. The minute I do my eyebrows and put on some eye liner people freak the fuck out.

I then made the mistake of meeting a friend at a strait club. It was EDM so I thought it would be a cool crowd. Well no it was bros and Debbie's, and boy did they hate me being there. Again you have a guy selling merchandise who is super nice and the bartender, she's super cool and friendly. Literally everyone else there was sending bad vibes in one way or another.

I get that I wasn't making much effort to pass. I couldn't even if I tried. I try not to make passing the end all goal but I would like to get there. However this experience has left me feeling like I'd never want to be stealth. I hate these horrible transphobes and I don't want anything to do with them anymore. If I was passing I could go in that club and maybe the same people would want to be around me. I wouldn't even know how they are such horrible people. 

After that I wanted some affirmation and found a guy on Grindr to hook up with. Increadibly he was really sweet and cool. We had sex and then lay there cuddling. It seemed to be going well when he suddenly gets up at 5:30 AM saying he has to get ready for work. He can't be rid of me fast enough and his whole demeanor had changed. It was awkward as I said ""maybe we can do this again some time"" and left. He blocked me as soon as I left.

I said I wouldn't let them make me cry. Well I cried. It definitely hasn't made me question transition. I am loving life far too much despite the difficulties to ever let anyone take this from me. It's probably a good idea to stop hooking up with probable chasers though. It's just wild how they either love us or hate us. A few go out of their way to show love. The rest show confusion, fear, revulsion, etc. I get hundreds of messages from guys telling me how I'm pretty, cute, beautiful, gorgeous, sexy, etc. Then I get these kids looking at me like a monster. It's just weird. ",9,1729128525.0,trans,1,1.0,False

After about a week, we exchanged numbers and started texting.

By the way, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, so I have no idea what to expect. I tend to overthink things, like why he replies so slowly or why he doesn‚Äôt text me first after we exchanged numbers. 

Eventually, I decided to just text him first because I kind of like him.

We‚Äôve talked about date ideas, but he hasn‚Äôt asked me out yet. Should I ask him out? And is it normal to text every day during the talking stage?",1,1729128407.0,Bumble,0,1.0,False
1g5fgx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1g5fgx7/the_unfiltered_debate/,The Unfiltered Debate ,"John sat on his worn couch, eyes fixed on the TV screen in his cramped apartment. The debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump played out in front of him. He clenched his fists as yet another question went unanswered.

""Vice President Harris, what would your administration do specifically to address the rise in crime in major cities?"" The moderator asked.

Harris, with her trademark smile and composed demeanor, leaned forward. ""Well, first, let me just say this: I find it deeply concerning that we‚Äôre seeing an increase in crime in many places across the country. It‚Äôs a reflection of so many systemic issues‚Äîeconomic inequality, lack of access to healthcare‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJust answer the question!‚Äù John muttered at the screen, exasperated as she pivoted to broader social issues without addressing the specifics.

The moderator turned to Trump. ""Mr. Trump, what would your administration do differently?""

Trump wasted no time. ""Look, it‚Äôs very simple, okay? The crime is out of control because of these Democrat-run cities. If you look at the cities where crime is the worst, every single one of them is run by Democrats. We need law and order, folks. Strong police, no nonsense‚Äî‚Äù

John's frustration boiled over. He slapped the remote down onto the coffee table, muting the TV. It was always the same‚Äîa barrage of talking points, evasion, and finger-pointing. Real issues lost in the noise. He pressed his palms into his temples, trying to calm the anger pulsing behind his eyes.

‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt keep happening. People deserve to hear the truth, not the same old garbage,‚Äù he muttered to himself. He stood up and began pacing his apartment, a plan forming in his mind‚Äîa plan that would force these two to confront their real positions, with nowhere to hide.


---


The faint hum of an engine cut out as John parked his van behind an old warehouse outside the city limits. He took a deep breath, his heart racing. He had spent weeks studying their schedules, anticipating the moments when they‚Äôd be alone, away from their security details.

Through careful planning and a stroke of luck, he managed to pull off the abductions. A tranquilizer gun, applied quietly and quickly, left both Trump and Harris unconscious. He moved them into the back of the van, ensuring they‚Äôd wake up in the space he had prepared.


---



Kamala Harris stirred first, her eyes fluttering open as she took in her surroundings. The dimly lit room was bare, except for a small square table with three chairs around it. Her hands, loosely bound to the chair arms, flexed as she realized her situation. Donald Trump woke up moments later, blinking against the harsh overhead light.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù Trump demanded, his voice hoarse with irritation, immediately tugging at his restraints. ‚ÄúYou know who you‚Äôre messing with, buddy? Let me go, and you might have a chance to save yourself.‚Äù

John ignored him, focusing on adjusting the camera in the corner. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be free when we‚Äôre done here. This isn‚Äôt about hurting you. It‚Äôs about making you talk.‚Äù

Harris, assessing the situation with a lawyer‚Äôs eye, tried to stay calm. ‚ÄúWho are you, and what do you think you‚Äôre doing here? You‚Äôre making a big mistake. People are going to notice if‚Äî‚Äù

John interrupted, his voice steady but strained. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll notice, but not before I‚Äôm finished. We‚Äôre going to have a real debate, right here, right now, with real answers. And every bit of it is going on camera.‚Äù

Both candidates went silent for a moment, the realization settling in. John took his seat, facing them across the table. He showed them the shock buttons‚Äîone marked ‚ÄúH‚Äù and the other ‚ÄúT.‚Äù He spoke quickly, before they could protest further.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how this works. You answer the questions directly, or you get a shock. It won‚Äôt hurt much, but it‚Äôll keep things moving. When I‚Äôm satisfied that the questions have been answered, I‚Äôll let you go, and the footage goes to the press.‚Äù

Trump scoffed, leaning back against his restraints. ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. People know me‚Äîthey know I don‚Äôt back down, I speak my mind. This‚Äôll be the same.‚Äù

John turned to Harris, who had been studying the setup with narrowed eyes. ‚ÄúYou think this is going to get you what you want?‚Äù she asked, her tone sharper now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illegal, and it‚Äôs insane.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. But what‚Äôs insane is that Americans can‚Äôt get a straight answer out of either of you without all the dodging and deflecting. So, we‚Äôre going to change that. First question: What is your specific plan to address inflation?‚Äù

Harris straightened her shoulders, glancing at Trump across the table before turning back to John. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a complex issue‚Äî‚Äù

John pressed the ‚ÄúH‚Äù button lightly. A small jolt ran through her, making her flinch. ‚ÄúStick to the point,‚Äù he said coldly.

She glared at him, but the jolt had the intended effect. ‚ÄúWe need to increase investment in renewable energy sectors to create jobs and stabilize markets. It‚Äôs not a short-term fix, but it would make our economy more resilient‚Äî‚Äù

Trump cut in with a derisive snort. ‚ÄúThis administration has no clue about business. We need to lower taxes, stop the government from strangling small businesses with regulations. That‚Äôs how you fix inflation, not with these ridiculous green energy fantasies.‚Äù

John hit Trump‚Äôs button. The former president jolted, eyes widening in surprise. ‚ÄúHey, what the‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúStay focused. Explain how that plan would directly lower inflation, not just boost your campaign,‚Äù John said, keeping his voice measured.

Trump‚Äôs face turned red, a combination of anger and indignation. ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs simple! Lower taxes put more money back into people‚Äôs pockets, they spend more, businesses grow, and inflation goes down.‚Äù

Harris rolled her eyes, leaning forward again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how it works, and you know it. Giving more money to corporations won‚Äôt help working families‚Äî‚Äù

John hit both buttons simultaneously, silencing them. He leaned in, his expression resolute. ‚ÄúNo arguments between you two. Just answers. I‚Äôm not here to watch you play politics. Next question.‚Äù

John tapped the table with a pen, watching the irritation simmer in the eyes of his two captives. He knew the next question would touch on a hot-button issue, but that was the point‚Äîto see if he could extract more than just sound bites.

‚ÄúNext question. Immigration. Both of you claim to have a plan to secure the border, but I want to hear it in detail. What is your approach, and how would you handle the humanitarian issues at the border? Ms. Harris, you first.‚Äù

Harris took a breath, her eyes flicking to the camera, trying to maintain a composed demeanor despite the absurdity of the situation. ‚ÄúLook, we have to address the root causes of migration‚Äîpoverty, violence, corruption in Central America. It‚Äôs why the Biden administration has focused on providing aid to those regions. At the same time, we need comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for Dreamers and the millions of undocumented people who contribute to our economy‚Äî‚Äù

John‚Äôs finger hovered over her button, and she caught herself. ‚ÄúBut...yes, we also need stronger border security to manage the flow of migrants. We‚Äôre not ignoring that, but we can‚Äôt turn our backs on our values. America has always been a place of refuge.‚Äù

Trump leaned forward in his chair, cutting in with his usual brashness. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why the border‚Äôs a disaster, folks. They don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing‚Äînever have. We had the border under control when I was in office. We built the wall, we had the Remain in Mexico policy‚Äî‚Äù

John pressed his button, sending a jolt through Trump. ‚ÄúSpecifics, Mr. Trump. Your policies might have reduced crossings, but they were criticized for inhumane conditions. What‚Äôs your response to that?‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs jaw tightened, and he squared his shoulders. ‚ÄúLook, you have to be tough, okay? The Remain in Mexico policy kept people on the other side until we could process them. That‚Äôs what you have to do. If you let everyone in, you end up with chaos at the border like they have now. And the wall? It worked. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it worked a lot better than what we‚Äôre seeing today.‚Äù

Harris raised an eyebrow, her frustration evident. ‚ÄúYou mean keeping desperate families in squalid conditions? That‚Äôs not who we are‚Äî‚Äù

John hit her button, interrupting. ‚ÄúStick to your plan. Why would yours work better?‚Äù

She bit back a sharp retort, visibly reigning in her frustration. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs about addressing the problem at the source, rather than treating human beings like numbers on a spreadsheet. Our plan may take time, but it‚Äôs about building a system that can handle immigration without resorting to cruelty.‚Äù

John glanced at his notes, knowing the next question would shift the tone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about the economy, and let‚Äôs be real about the deficit. Each of you has promised things that would balloon it. How do you plan to handle the national debt while funding the programs you‚Äôre proposing? Mr. Trump, you go first.‚Äù

Trump smirked, settling into the familiar rhythm of a topic he felt confident about. ‚ÄúWe cut taxes, we cut regulations, we bring jobs back to America. You do that, the economy grows, and the debt takes care of itself. Under my administration, we had the best economy ever‚Äîrecord low unemployment, stock market booming, and we were bringing in more money than anyone thought possible.‚Äù

John didn‚Äôt hesitate to press the button, though more lightly this time. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an answer to the question. You know as well as I do that tax cuts also mean less revenue. How would you balance that?‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs confidence faltered slightly, but he quickly recovered, leaning into his defense. ‚ÄúLook, you cut taxes, businesses grow, more jobs, more people working means more people paying taxes. It‚Äôs common sense, not like the Green New Deal nonsense. What we don‚Äôt need is more spending.‚Äù

Harris interjected before John could silence her, visibly seizing the moment. ‚ÄúCutting taxes for the wealthy doesn‚Äôt grow the economy‚Äîit grows income inequality. It‚Äôs a failed trickle-down theory that never works. What we need is to invest in our infrastructure, in clean energy, in education‚Äîthings that create jobs and build a sustainable future. And yes, it requires raising taxes on the richest among us, because they‚Äôve benefitted from our economy more than anyone.‚Äù

John leaned forward, pressing the ‚ÄúH‚Äù button lightly. ‚ÄúAnd how do you justify increasing spending when the national debt is already a problem? Where do you cut?‚Äù

Harris‚Äôs expression tightened. ‚ÄúWe need to ensure that our spending is targeted toward the most critical areas. It‚Äôs not about cutting across the board‚Äîit‚Äôs about making smart investments that pay off in the long run. And that includes reforming the tax code so corporations and the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share. Without those investments, we‚Äôre leaving our future behind.‚Äù

Trump couldn‚Äôt resist jumping back in. ‚ÄúTypical Democrat‚Äîspending, spending, spending. They want to tax you into oblivion! It‚Äôs why we‚Äôve got inflation through the roof, and they‚Äôre only going to make it worse.‚Äù

John‚Äôs finger hovered over Trump‚Äôs button, but this time he let the exchange continue, sensing that the pressure was pushing both candidates to speak more candidly than they might have on stage.

John raised a new question, the pen tapping rhythmically against the table. ‚ÄúHealthcare. Both of you have radically different ideas. Let‚Äôs see if we can get to the heart of this. Trump, why do you believe the Affordable Care Act should be repealed? What‚Äôs your plan for those who rely on it?‚Äù

Trump leaned forward, his tone forceful. ‚ÄúObamacare is a disaster. Premiums skyrocketed, people lost their plans‚Äîmillions of them. What we want is to give people choice. We get rid of Obamacare, we create a system with private plans that people can pick from. If you have competition, you drive down prices. We‚Äôre not just putting everyone on a government plan‚Äî‚Äù

John cut him off with a shock, making him flinch. ‚ÄúAnd what about those with pre-existing conditions? You promised to protect them, but the plan you pushed didn‚Äôt have that coverage.‚Äù

Trump scowled. ‚ÄúWe were going to protect them, but the Democrats kept blocking everything we tried to do. It‚Äôs not like they wanted to work together‚Äîthey just want government control over everything.‚Äù

Harris jumped in, her voice carrying a sharper edge. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about control‚Äîit‚Äôs about making sure everyone has access to affordable healthcare, not just those who can afford a private plan. Under the Biden administration, we‚Äôve expanded access, built on the ACA, and made sure that no one is left behind. It‚Äôs a start, but we know more needs to be done.‚Äù

John pressed the ‚ÄúH‚Äù button again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not enough, Harris. What‚Äôs your plan for those who still fall through the cracks? Medicare-for-All was popular among some voters, but you‚Äôve stayed away from it.‚Äù

She took a deep breath, clearly frustrated. ‚ÄúMedicare-for-All isn‚Äôt feasible right now. It‚Äôs a good goal, but the transition would be too disruptive. We‚Äôre focused on expanding public options and reducing costs for those on the ACA, while working to bring down prescription drug prices. It‚Äôs a balanced approach that keeps our promises without jeopardizing the care people rely on.‚Äù

The back-and-forth continued, each question delving into topics they‚Äôd rehearsed a thousand times‚Äîforeign policy, gun control, climate change‚Äîbut now they couldn‚Äôt slip into their comfortable routines. Each time they drifted, John forced them back, making them address the specifics they usually avoided.

As the hours dragged on, the candidates‚Äô polished facades began to crack under the weight of unrelenting pressure. Trump‚Äôs impatience boiled over in flashes of anger, while Harris‚Äôs composed veneer occasionally gave way to a frustrated sharpness. Both found themselves saying things they might never have said under the bright lights of a televised debate, and John captured it all on tape, determined that the country would see them as they truly were.

John leaned back in his chair, sensing that both candidates had reached their limits, but there was one final topic he wanted to push them on. It was a question that no campaign manager or debate moderator would ever dare ask so bluntly, and that made it perfect for this unorthodox debate.

‚ÄúLast question, and it‚Äôs simple: Why do you think you deserve to be president of the United States? And more importantly, why should the people trust you? No attacks on each other‚Äîjust focus on yourself. Ms. Harris, you go first.‚Äù

Kamala Harris took a deep breath, composing herself before answering. She glanced at the camera, her voice steady but carrying an edge of exhaustion. ‚ÄúI believe in the power of this country to move forward and to correct its mistakes. My entire career has been about seeking justice and trying to bring people together to solve our toughest problems. I know that the work is hard and that progress can be slow, but it‚Äôs possible. I believe in the vision President Biden and I have put forward‚Äîone that is inclusive, that respects human dignity, and that is rooted in the idea that every American deserves a fair shot. People can trust me because I‚Äôve always fought for those who didn‚Äôt have a voice, and I‚Äôm not going to stop now.‚Äù

She paused, looking across the table at Trump, then back at John. ‚ÄúYou may not agree with me on everything, but you‚Äôll always know where I stand. And I think that matters.‚Äù

John nodded, turning his gaze to Trump. ‚ÄúYour turn, Mr. Trump. Same question.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs expression was a mix of defiance and fatigue, his usual bravado tempered by the weariness of the day. He shifted in his seat, the shadows under his eyes stark in the harsh light. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve been through a lot, and so has this country. But when I was president, we got things done. We had a strong economy, we stood up to China, we brought respect back to this country. People felt like America was winning again, and I‚Äôm the one who did that. I‚Äôm running because I believe we can do that again‚Äîbring back that strength, that pride. I‚Äôve always said it like it is, whether people like it or not. And I think that‚Äôs why people trust me.‚Äù

He leaned forward, locking eyes with the camera, his voice hardening. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not a politician. I‚Äôm not going to sit here and give you speeches‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to fight for what I think is right. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll keep doing.""

John watched them both for a moment, the weight of their words hanging in the air. He knew they were both aware of what would come next‚Äîthe footage being sent out, the authorities tracking him down, the media firestorm. But for the first time in a long while, he felt a strange sense of satisfaction. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was real.

He stood up, facing the camera directly as he addressed the future audience. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just heard from both candidates, without any of the usual filters or spin. I did this because I‚Äôm tired of the noise‚Äîthe constant half-truths, the blame-shifting, and the talking points. I wanted you, the American people, to see them as they are when they‚Äôre pressed to speak honestly. Maybe you agree with them, maybe you don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not up to me. But now, at least, you can decide based on more than the spectacle of a debate stage or a campaign ad.‚Äù

He turned to Harris and Trump, who were still seated, looking both stunned and defiant. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be released, and you‚Äôll go back to your campaigns. But this footage is going out‚Äîunedited, unchanged. I know I‚Äôll be arrested, and that‚Äôs fine. I did what I came here to do.‚Äù

John glanced at the red recording light on the camera one last time, his face resolute. ‚ÄúMake of this what you will, America. You deserve the truth, even if it‚Äôs messy.‚Äù

With that, he hit the button to stop the recording. He knew the world outside was already closing in on him, but for a moment, there was silence in the room. The candidates, the cameras, and the man who dared to break the rules of the political game all sat in the quiet, waiting for the consequences to unfold.


---


The footage, as promised, spread like wildfire. It aired on every major network and across social media, dissected and debated by pundits, citizens, and conspiracy theorists alike. John was swiftly arrested, his act condemned as a kidnapping but lauded by some as an act of frustrated patriotism.

For the candidates, the fallout was immediate and complex. Harris‚Äôs supporters saw a fighter, while her critics saw her unwilling to adapt. Trump‚Äôs base admired his defiance, even in an absurd situation, while others saw him as a stubborn figure clinging to old grievances. The public, at least for a brief moment, saw their politics stripped of the polish‚Äîand each had to decide for themselves what that meant.

And as John sat in his cell, awaiting trial, he couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sliver of hope. The debate might not have changed the world, but it had brought a piece of the truth to light, and maybe that was enough.",1,1729128350.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I kind of imagined her by my side and a part of my group and family. In the two months since, I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking of her.

Since that time, she‚Äôs been seeing a guy in the city she lives in. Since we are (or were) so close, she would tell me about everything. Apparently, he‚Äôs very attractive to her but she doesn‚Äôt enjoy the sex and he‚Äôs not too affectionate. She wanted a relationship and they talked about it. He hinted at wanting one but basically has kept her around as a fwb and will sometimes ghost her and then come back. It was hard to listen to all this but I always encouraged her to pursue this because I do care about her. I recognize that she likes him (even if she won‚Äôt admit it) and want her to be happy. Also, she has a history of being SA‚Äôd and guys overall not respecting her so I was happy that she was finally dating again. She truly was my older sister and no matter what, I want my older sister to be happy.

Here's where I ruined everything. A week ago, I went to visit her for a week (since I WFH). It was super great at first, we hung out and talked and caught up. She wasn‚Äôt texting the guy anymore and said herself that it was over, she just wanted her earrings back from him.

When she was at work one day and when I was WFH at her apartment, I sent her a text confessing my feelings and letting her know how I felt but that it was totally okay if she didn‚Äôt feel the same way. I asked for a green light to make a move and emphasized how much I cared about her and respected her and just had to get it off my chest.

She was very surprised and said that I was her best friend and she needed our friendship to be strong. We briefly talked about it a bit and she was very understanding. It was cool. It surprised her and it was fair so I didn‚Äôt have a problem with it and was happy to move forward. I know she still valued and respected me.

It would have been fine if it ended here but I ruined things the next day. Everything was normal and we were watching a movie together on the couch. I was getting hints of a vibe and stupidly put my arm around her shoulder. I made it light hearted by saying ‚ÄúOh, my shoulder hurts‚Äù as a joke to do it. She said ‚ÄúStop dude‚Äù so we continued with the movie and that was it. The next day, while she was at a work happy hour and I was working from her house, she got drunk and sent me a long text about how uncomfortable she was and how I crossed her boundary. She said she didn‚Äôt give me a green light and I still tried. She ranted about how all guys were the same and right away, I realized how much pain I caused and how she was triggered and it was all my fault. She thought I was only visiting her to get with her and felt that guys just never respect her. I felt a lot of shame, apologized profusely, and got a hotel for the rest of my trip even though she said not to. Before I left, we met for coffee and both apologized. She said she was drunk and confused this with a lot of her other trauma and didn‚Äôt mean to be so intense. I know she was hurt and just saying that to make me feel better.

I‚Äôm back from visiting her and things are broken. We aren‚Äôt texting or messaging. I sent her a check in text but she took a whole day to respond which she never did before and was brief. I think our friendship is broken forever and it‚Äôs my fault. I know she met up with that guy again the day after I left. I‚Äôm happy for her and want her to continue with him but I still want to keep my friendship with her.

  
I hate what I did but I‚Äôm so upset that our friendship is gone now. There have been many times she‚Äôs crossed my boundaries and I always stuck with her. One time, the first year she met, she kept trying to get me to hook up with one of her friends who was drunk. I personally don‚Äôt drink so was really uncomfortable but she kept pushing until another friend had to step in to stop her. I‚Äôve always been the one to primarily take care of her whenever she‚Äôs been too drunk when we‚Äôve gone out with friends (which is almost every time). She‚Äôs put me in many weird situations with strangers but I always took care of her and had her back. I know that doesn‚Äôt cancel out what I did but my mind is so confused as to how she can just throw away the friendship. I never meant to hurt her even though I clearly did. 

Do I try to talk to her or just give her space? I think if I detach, then we would just lose touch since she lives so far away and we don‚Äôt have many mutuals since she‚Äôs lost her friendship with them for unrelated reasons. Maybe that‚Äôs for the best. I just want my best friend back and if I could go back in time and punch myself in the face before any of this, I would in a heartbeat.

A little about me:

I absolutely love music - whether it's playing guitar, spinning vinyl (I love collecting and listening to records), or going to concerts. It'd be great to find a more concert friends! Let me know what upcoming concerts you're going to! I also love spending time outside with my dog. He's got a cute outdoorsy name but you'll have to message me to find out what it is haha. We go on all sorts of adventures running, hiking, camping, paddle boarding, and hammocking. 

Recently I've been getting more into coffee and I think it'd be super fun to have someone to share a virtual coffee/tea with almost daily if time allows and the interest is there. I don't have to work until 9:00 AM most days and I get up early and usually just listen to one side of a record or read a Marvel comic online before heading to work. But it'd be fun to spend that time having a nice morning chat with someone while we sip on our drinks. I know that physical attraction is important and I'm happy to exchange photos early-on to determine if there's mutual physical attraction. But to give you a quick idea of what I look like, I'm white, 6'3"", 170 lbs, (tall and trim lol), blond hair, and my friends (and even strangers) frequently compliment my mustache haha.

I am building a coffee cart and am in the need of some advice. I have some running water requirements on this cart for which I am seeking some help. I have installed a sink, a pitcher rinser and a faucet on the cart but need advice on how to get the adequate water supply. Here's my (theoretical) plan in this sequence:
20L fresh water tank - 40psi 0.6gal/min water pump - 0.75L 125 psi accumulator - four connections out:
-one to cold water faucet
-one to a pitcher rinser
-one to a 2 gallon hot water tank and from the tank to the hot water faucet
-one to a drip coffee brewer
Please note that none of these four connections will be running simultaneously. There will always be only one of the above four outlets pulling water at a time. 

Not having any experience with water pumps and accumulators, my question is will a 0.6 gal/min flow rate and 40psi pump aided by an accumulator be enough to supply water to all of the above mentioned connections? Do I need a bigger pump? My other pump option is a 3 gal/min 45psi RV pump (I'll have to find an adapter to get the 12V DC power to this pump, but I can figure something out for that). 

Your advice will be immensely appreciated.

I've never really initiated much of a conversation with her, admittedly this is partly cause i find her a bit intimidating in a good way, but there have been a few times she'd flirtatiously tease me about something dumb in the past.  Like once it was that I was in shorts when it was cold out, or another time I didn't bring my dog and she made a sassy remark about it.  

Well finally a couple of weeks back our dogs said hi and that kinda opened things up to us now smiling and stopping to say hi each time we see each other.  Each time we've talked for longer and she would reveal more about her than I imagine you would to any acquaintance.  

Today we had quite a long and fun conversation.  She has an accent so I finally asked her about her heritage and she asked about mine.  She was smiling and keeping eye contact through the whole conversation.  We talked about a lot of things and finally we got to talking about drinks and I mentioned how it's known amongst my friends that if I'm drinking, it's a screwdriver.  I was explaining what it is and she tells me, ""oh I'm a bartender.  You should try a {can't remember the name} that adds cranberry"". So I asked her ""oh, where do you bartend?""  She told me the place and as she was describing the bar, she mentioned that Wednesday night's they do Open Mic, so if I like live entertainment I should go, but she doesn't work those nights, except she happens to work tonight.  Then she said she had to go cause she was picking up her drink to-go.  I told her to have a great day and that I really enjoyed talking to her.  She looked back at me smiling and said ""thank you, I enjoyed it too"".  She said it in a very thoughtful way, like she actually thought about it and genuinely meant it rather than just casually tossing that as a polite response.

So my question here is, would me going to have a drink at the bar she works at tonight be deemed as weird or was that an open-ended invitation.  I've already decided I'm going to ask her out, but I don't know if it's better to do it tonight or do it the next time I see her at the coffee shop.

BACKGROUND:   
I did not want my MoH to be my MoH. It may sound shitty of me, but I was put in a very uncomfortable situation with my family and was pressured into choosing her. I knew who I wanted, and my family thought their choice would be a better.   
Since she lives out of the country, we were trying to figure out when would be a good time for her to come and stay for the wedding. She originally wanted to stay two weeks - I don't have the PTO for that, and also, selfishly, I wanted it to be just me and my new husband after we got married. She stated that if she's coming to my country, she wanted to make it a long time so it was worth the money and the trip. So I backed down and agreed on 10 days. 

FULL STORY:   
My MoH is from out of the country. My fiance and I opened our home to her for her to stay the week before our wedding (**mistake**) that way she wouldn't have to stay at a hotel.   
-> **This was a mistake because it did nothing but stress me out because now I had to be a host as well as get ready for a wedding. I did this originally because my father said ""it'll be a great time! She'll be able to help you with everything you're stressing with!"" and that did not happen. PLUS, I got NO ALONE TIME with my Husband to be - not to mention NO alone time to myself. I am someone who needs to recharge.**  
When she arrived, I was truly psyched to see her. I asked her the basic questions and got basic answers. Then I asked ""How's studying going?"" as she is studying to be a doctor, and that was too long of a conversation. She never really asked how the wedding planning was going or what my fiance and I needed help with. She gave no mention of our wedding whatsoever until I mentioned it hours later. This kinda bothered me, but I knew she was jet-lagged and brushed it off.

Next day, she had a slight little cough. I didn't think too much about this as we have cats - and one of my cats sheds like crazy. She started stressing about it, telling me all about all the lung issues it could be, and I told her about how my dad when he visits also gets coughs from our kitty's dander. She responded with ""but I'm not allergic to cats"" and ""I didn't respond this way last time I was here"" and got even more anxious. I urged her to take an allergy pill as she hasn't been to our country in the fall, and I have a new cat as well, so all of that could've been easily explained to me. Nevertheless, we still went out and about ... and I paid for everything. I don't have a lot to spend because ... ya know ... weddings are expensive my dudes.

A day later, her cough got a bit worse. I asked her if she took the allergy pill and she said she did, but explained that her allergy pill was used to treat her anxiety. I had no idea what that meant, and it didn't sound legit, but I didn't want to look too far into someone else's pills. I didn't feel like it was my business to press on it. She really started freaking out a bit more and kept telling me she thought it was like a pulmonary edema or something, and I honestly felt that was a bit dramatic. I offered our allergy pills, and she refused.

The following day, she stayed in her room. We had a plan to go shopping with the rest of my bridal party. She summoned me to her room when they started arriving. I noticed she was in tears, so I closed the door. She then said that she had a fever (I got her a thermometer to confirm, and yes she did) since the previous day and didn't want to get anyone sick so she would be staying behind. At that point in my mind I was thinking ""*If you have a fever, why the fuck did you make me come into a potentially contagious space with you???*"" but I assured her I would take her to urgent care if it got worse the next day. I told her we had tea and ibuprofen, and she asked for me to buy her some additional things. Sixty dollars later, I bought her sick gear, and asked her to quarantine in her room in case she had COVID. She agreed, and I talked to my friend who had arrived and asked her if she was okay still going out and about. She was, and I texted the rest of my group - they were all fine with it. So off we went.

The next day, I was hungover. She still wanted to go to urgent care, so I got myself out of bed with a headache, sore throat, my chest feeling weird, and drove her there. She wore a mask there, and in the waiting room, and then in the exam room. While we were there she criticized the legitimacy of the initial exam. She said the nurse did it wrong, and she was now worried that they were going to mess up her examination. I'm still hungover ... so I don't really have the patience to listen to how shitty our healthcare and medical procedures are. I admit, I tuned her out. They give her a chest x-ray. Wuhlah - she has a contagious lung infection. The doctor said that she was **not contagious** and no longer had to wear a mask. I asked the question again to confirm because she still had a fever, and the doctor said again that she was **not contagious**. So BAM! Off went the mask, open mouth coughing like a toddler, and spending time with my fiance and I. I was truly uncomfortable with her still being around us, to be honest, but I didn't want to be a bitch so I didn't say anything. We went to the grocery store for her meds and she wanted more groceries for her so she didn't have a hurt stomach on the antibiotics, so I spent another sixty dollars. I also bought us lunch for her to eat immediately for her meds, and she took two bites and then threw it away. This is where I started getting pissed. What set me over the edge is that when I told my dad about her getting sick, he sent me a laundry list of the things I needed to do in order to make sure that she was okay. Um ... I'm getting MARRIED???? IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT THIS POINT???? AND YOU WANT ME TO STAY AROUND AND CATER TO A SICK PERSON??? CONTAGIOUS OR NOT???? Like I'm sorry she's sick, but why do I need to be the bedside nurse when she's walking around, laughing, and able to stay up till past midnight? I'm already paying for everything anyways! I vented to my mom and she called me a ***bridezilla***, and when I vented to my fiance he had a look like ""***who are you and who am I marrying?***"" - that look from him about broke my heart.

When I woke the next day, I still had a sore throat, a heavy weight on my chest, and started coughing slightly. It didn't feel like I could really breath. I do have asthma and tend to get bad lung infections, so I started getting nervous. I try to relax and say it's all in my head, throw away her used tissues she left on the coffee table, cook breakfast and make myself coffee. She comes down and says ""I thought we were going to \[restaurant\]."" Admittedly, I did say that last night, but I've got a lot going on, so I tell her that I made eggs and there's enough for her. She comments ""well I need something to eat in order to take my meds."". Ummmmm ... eggs? That I made? Edible? I ask her if she's even hungry and she said she was looking forward to going to \[restaurant\]. I tell her we can go then, and she pulls the classic ""oh you just made breakfast though! I can wait!"" but doesn't push afterward I said it was fine. So I angrily get ready (out of sight), and take her there. And pay for the breakfast. When I come home, I take a shower, and with the steam it felt like I could breathe in more deeply, but it really hurt. So I called my mom and she told me ""***What did you expect when you're around a sick person? Go to the urgent care.***"" So I did. I'm crying, I'm frustrated, I'm screaming in my car. The doctor says I have a low-grade fever of 99.2. The doctor also says ""***Why did that nurse practitioner tell you she wasn't contagious? She's contagious 48 hours after the fever breaks.***"" I could've screamed. I get my chest x-rayed, and though there's no sign of pneumonia, with my medical history, asthma, and the fact I was around a contagious person, she diagnosed me as being positive. She tells me I have to be on antibiotics for 5 days, and both of us have to quarantined from my fiance. I'm in tears. I call my mom and she says ""***Don't stress about it. Don't worry about should-a, would-a, could-a. It's done. Just get better now.***"" and when I call my dad he says ""***That sucks. But at least y'all can snuggle on the couch and giggle and watch movies until ya feel better!***"" And I snap. I finally ... snap. Why the fuck would I want to snuggle on the couch with someone who got me sick? If she was a medical student, shouldn't she know about contagiousness? Fevers? She knew enough to criticize our nurses, surely that means she should know she shouldn't be OPEN MOUTHED COUGHING WITH A 100 DEGREE FEVER AROUND ME RIGHT??? :) I have to pay for my meds, necessary sick shit for me, and the appointment. I've spent close to $500 dollars that was for other things than medical shit for me and one other person. She did pay for her urgent care visit but told me she would be fully reimbursed once she got home. She also said ""I told my friend about the healthcare here, and they said they would only go to the doctor if they were *dying*!"" Haha, yeaaaahhhh :) 

There goes my nail appointment. My spa appointment. There goes drinking during my wedding. There goes drinking at my rehearsal dinner. One of my bridesmaids says she isn't coming now because she's immuno-compromised and is scared of getting sick (which I totally get - take care of you boo). Our bridal party is debating wearing masks even past my contagious time, so now my pictures may have masks in them.

I'm not mad that she got sick. I also don't blame her for getting sick - you can't control that shit. I'm pissed because my fucking MoH should've been more mindful. Like if I was in her position, I would be wearing a mask EVERYWHERE. I would be buying my own health things and not shoving that on other people. I would be quarantining and staying away from the two MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE AT THE FUCKING WEDDING. I have done no harsh or mean actions towards her in response to this, though I have had to vent a few times (guys I'm human, and there was more shit going on than what I put in here). The most I've done is ask her to give me some space for a while upon coming home from the doctors as I was incredibly emotional, and I don't think that was too mean of me to do.

**So if you've read this long, am I truly a bridezilla? And if so, what part made me so?**

1g5f1bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/1g5f1bd/weird_issue/,Weird issue,"Hey guys, due to my last pc getting ""thirsty"" I had to replace it about 8 months early. Got the parts in and put it all together but when testing it I found something odd and I thought I'd see if you guys had an idea of what I can do to test the issue or identify what is happening.

So when running different games for testing everything will run normally at first, the temps look fine, the load looks fine, but in the midst of running the game I will audibly hear the graphics card's fans slow down and the actual game will crash.

Games and temps when it happened:

No man's sky on high to ultra would peak the graphics card at about 87% and the cpu never hit higher than 68% utilization temps didn't go above 50c. It happened about once an hour 

  
Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader, similar issue, graphics never hit above 70% utilization, cpu didn't really go higher than 40% utilization, temps didn't go above 47c but it was happening more commonly, about once every 45 minutes

  
Black Myth Wukong on high settings had consistent 80% utilization and temps went about mid to high 50s, freezing happened about every 30 - 45 minutes.

Based on everything I've narrowed it down to a few possibilities:  
Drivers - I straight transfered my drives but did not reinstall windows or anything on the main drive so there could be some conflict from drivers I might've failed to uninstall.

Power Supply - The power supply is from the old pc because it avoided sipping coffee like the rest of the old computer in the accident. It is about 4 years old almost going on 5 but I've been taking good care of it otherwise.

The graphics card - The manufacturer sent me a graphics card that was faulty

if you guys have any idea how to narrow it down further or just realize what I'm dealing with I'd appreciate hearing it!

Does anyone have recommendations for where else to apply?

I am a recent immigrant and have been living in the US permanently for about 2 years now after marrying my US husband. 
We live in a pretty remote area, I am an introvert, and my husband's very small family is basically my only support system and social connections. I don't know the area very well because we don't go out and about often. We are true dull, homebodies. 
Two days ago, my husband had emergency brain surgery. He is still in ICU, and his mother and father are the only people I have to support me right now. My MIL immediately ran to Facebook and is posting every single detail (exaggerating some things) to get as much sympathy as possible. She keeps telling me about all the thoughts and prayers people are sending, and I said that I don't really want to read messages from strangers. 
I unfortunately do not have a US driver's license at the moment, so I have to go with her to the hospital, which is 30 minutes away. Yesterday, when we visited my husband and she was ready to leave, I stated that I'm going to stay longer as he was starting to become more alert. She said that she's not going to drive back and forth, I said that I did not expect her to and that I would get an Uber. She totally flipped her shit for some reason. I was not in the mood to argue, so I went home with her. This morning I wanted to leave early so I asked her what time she is planning to go. She said that there are people visiting her, and she's not going to just send them away. I said that is no problem and that I am going to take an Uber and I will see her at the hospital later. She flipped her shit again and called me impatient and selfish. Anyway, at the hospital, I was so happy because even though my husband only spoke gibberish due to the swelling on his left hemisphere, he was able to recognize and smile at me. She was not positive over the progress and kept going on and on over how I'm taking everything so ""lightly"" because according to her he's probably going to have to get speech theraphy for months and do so much rehab and he might never be normal again. I told her I honestly don't give a crap about that. The only thing I care about is my husband being alive and not in a vegetative state and him getting out of ICU status. I later heard her telling the nurse that they should give important updates and information to her instead because I don't seem to understand what's going on or what they are telling me. She also insulted me behind my back to my stepson over my weight, my ""rudeness"" to not want to go have dinner with people I have never met before and because I told her I don't want her daughter to visit my husband because he told me multiple times ""my sister is dead to me"" and I know he will get upset if he knows she was allowed in the room. I am so shattered, my MIL and I had a great relationship, and I truly thought she loved me. Last week, she came over for coffee, and we had a great time. All of a sudden, in my darkest hour, where I have no support other than her, she has turned against me, and I have no idea how to get through this. I have absolutely no one at the moment.

I used to think so but I've been seeing people say that they wear sunscreen on their body so now I'm no longer sure that normal clothing are enough for sun protection .

Personally, I only wear sunscreen if I'm going to be outside for more than 10 minutes and never if I'm indoors ( school / coffee shop / library etc...) so thewearing sunscreen under clothes always seems a bit too much but now I'm wondering if I was wrong.

Background is I'm coming up on nine months hrt and finally seeing some real changes. I've been socially transitioning with family and friends but not work yet. I mostly boy mode in public. I've been presenting femme in safe spaces such as trans socials, gay bars, queer coffee shops, and raves. I've been getting more confident and felt ready to fully transition soon.

So I got a ticket for a music fest and didn't have anyone to go with. I was mainly going to see Chapell Roan, Dom Dolla, and Sturgill Simpson. I dressed pretty androgynous with short shorts, tank top, sneakers. However this being a Chapell show I femmed it up a bit with jewelry and some light makeup. I really wasn't expecting a bunch of transphobes.

At Chapell there was this teenage girl just staring a hole in me. Then the looks from a group of teens in front of me. Looks of fear and disgust. I moved around a bit and ended up near some people who seemed cool and enjoyed the show. One lady smiled and blew me a kiss.

At Dom Dolla it was a much cooler crowd. I found a crew flying a rainbow flag and hung out by them. Mostly positive interactions but I did get some puzzled looks from even the gay guys. The beautiful women dancing with the gays rolled her eyes at me.

Now Sturgill is country but he is liberal and sings about psychedelics and such. I guess the church ladies didn't get the memo. This one lady was giving me the death stare. She was so angry that I would dare stand within site of her children. Tells her husband, then they are both staring. Another couple looks upset with my presence and walk away.

Now I was on some substances that had me looking all sweaty, but I really don't think that was it. It's just crazy how I could wear the same outfit in boymode no problem. The minute I do my eyebrows and put on some eye liner people freak the fuck out.

I then made the mistake of meeting a friend at a strait club. It was EDM so I thought it would be a cool crowd. Well no it was bros and Debbie's, and boy did they hate me being there. Again you have a guy selling merchandise who is super nice and the bartender, she's super cool and friendly. Literally everyone else there was sending bad vibes in one way or another.

I get that I wasn't making much effort to pass. I couldn't even if I tried. I try not to make passing the end all goal but I would like to get there. However this experience has left me feeling like I'd never want to be stealth. I hate these horrible transphobes and I don't want anything to do with them anymore. If I was passing I could go in that club and maybe the same people would want to be around me. I wouldn't even know how they are such horrible people. 

After that I wanted some affirmation and found a guy on Grindr to hook up with. Increadibly he was really sweet and cool. We had sex and then lay there cuddling. It seemed to be going well when he suddenly gets up at 5:30 AM saying he has to get ready for work. He can't be rid of me fast enough and his whole demeanor had changed. It was awkward as I said ""maybe we can do this again some time"" and left. He blocked me as soon as I left.

I said I wouldn't let them make me cry. Well I cried. It definitely hasn't made me question transition. I am loving life far too much despite the difficulties to ever let anyone take this from me. It's probably a good idea to stop hooking up with probable chasers though. It's just wild how they either love us or hate us. A few go out of their way to show love. The rest show confusion, fear, revulsion, etc. I get hundreds of messages from guys telling me how I'm pretty, cute, beautiful, gorgeous, sexy, etc. Then I get these kids looking at me like a monster. It's just weird. ",17,1729126032.0,MtF,2,0.96,False
